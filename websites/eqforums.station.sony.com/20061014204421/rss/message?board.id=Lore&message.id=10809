    <description>&lt;div&gt;...should it be taken seriously or not?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What makes me say this is I was reading about the &amp;quot;Fall of the Combine Empire&amp;quot; MM and its a 180 from what the old lore tells about the Fall.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Originaly it was said Seru poisoned Katta and his &amp;quot;body&amp;quot; is placed in stasis by his wife in some secret location... in the MM Seru and Katta engage in a Duel and Seru kills him...though if you win Katta respawns, its clearly a Lot different from the old manual story and how npcs in Katta discribe the final days of the Empire.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This makes me wonder about other missions, should mm lore be considered an &amp;quot;outdside&amp;quot; source of lore? I mean technicaly its not &amp;quot;in norrath&amp;quot; as you are entering some sort of &amp;quot;time warp / dream state&amp;quot; when doing them, could they be taken as just someones interpitation of past events and you are reliving thier (twisted?) memory.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What do you guys think about the lore coming out of them?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This in addition to the contradition in the Morden Rasp MM, I would say that all MMs are as a whole just made up ingame stories that the NPCs have made up to make things be more dramatic than they actually were originally.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For example which is more dramatic and exciting?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Morden and his small band sit in a boat under the cover of fog and&amp;nbsp;then&amp;nbsp;ambush another&amp;nbsp;small boat.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Morden and co. stage a daring raid on a boat docked in Dulak.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Personally, the story sounds a lot more exciting if they had to go into the "enemy's den" to get the item than just jump them in the fog and take it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Then we have this Combine MM, which is more dramatic?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Seru secretly hires an assassin to poison Katta, because he doesn't agree with Katta's new policies.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Seru duels Katta about the new policies.&amp;nbsp; Making it well known that he doesn't like Katta and what he's doing.&amp;nbsp; Loses the duel and as an act of desperation and revenge has an assassin poison Katta.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I think that these stories are just dramatic interpretations of what actually happened.&amp;nbsp; Now if there was a mission that said I am going to turn you into a monster and have you go do this for me right now, then that might actually result in accurate lore.&amp;nbsp; From my experience MM lore is extremely biased.&amp;nbsp; Personally I am going to take any ingame lore (which imo includes the story window) stated as being said by NPC's as what happened before lore from MMs when the 2 contradict each other.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Xianzu_Monk_Tunare on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;04-21-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;08:00 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;it was already well known that seru did not like katta. its quite possible at some stage he did duel them and with that settled and lost would of had to resort to using an assasin.&amp;nbsp; what the mission giver says is very important to how this lore would be cosnidered and wether it is a replacement scenerrio for what actually happened or a lead in scenario to hwhat would later happen... of course noones provided the text</description>

&lt;P&gt;Perhaps someone can post the exact part that's contradictory.&amp;nbsp; I don't think the story line window gives many specifications - in the Monster Mission you snatch it from a boat, in the story line window they snatch it from a boat...&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;lore to support what xiznu?&amp;nbsp;where is your lore to support that the monster mission contradicts the luclin story of katta hiring an assasin.. i havent seen lore i ve seen the events that take place in the monster mission described but out of context with no disclosure o f the actual text the monster mission gives. now if your ready to provide the context&amp;nbsp; that the mission giver&amp;nbsp; gives . for all i know he could of said here is a play i wrote about seru and katta. or he could of said here is a retleling of an event that took place in the combine error. or he could of said here was the event that divided the combine empire and sent them into civil war/ without the context or the text of the original mission giver any statemnt that it is a contradiction is null and void show me something that states seru could not have challenged&amp;nbsp; katta to a dual in the ten years before th e collapse of the combine era&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Tornicade_IV on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;04-21-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;09:59 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;At the bottom of the Arena in Sactus Seru (Part 1), you will find Arena Master Ferin. He is the quest giver. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You say, 'Hail, Arena Master Ferin' &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Arena Master Ferin says 'Hurry, hurry step right up and buy a ticket! Show your skills at battle! Amaze the crowds with your great skill! Buy a ticket from me, and when you think you are prepared for the fight give me &lt;BR&gt;the ticket! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He is a shopkeeper. Just right click to buy a ticket. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Arena Master Ferin says 'Hi there Turlo, just browsing? Have you seen the Arena Ticket I just got in?' &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Arena Master Ferin tells you, 'That'll be 33 platinum 4 silver for the Arena Ticket'. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You give 33 platinum 4 silver to Arena Master Ferin. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Not the greatest price. Was not wearing my charisma gear. Next, give Arena Master Ferin the ticket you just purchased from him. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Arena Master Ferin says 'So you wish to show off your skills in the arena? Well come on let us see what you are made of! Be warned that this is a fight to the death, if a guard sees you fleeing like a coward they will assist in helping to finish you off&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Tilbok Furrunner says 'The teaching in the city is that Katta feigned his death to blame it on Seru. When in fact Seru actually poisoned Katta. The crusade that Seru leads is false and must be stopped. We must gain access to Seru's [chambers] and destroy him and show the city the truth&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Euzan Jurek says 'By now you must realize that we need to avoid the question because of whom we are. Seru is not the Noble Paladin this city would have you believe. You see they teach that Katta feared Seru and that he had faked his own poisoning so they could pin the blame on Seru. The next thing that I ask of you, I ask because you can travel without question from one city to another. Go to Katta and give this report to Tilbok Furrunner. Tell him we are successfully rooted within Sanctus Seru and await any commands.' &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;STRONG&gt;Exert from the story window:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Morden and Nedaria Debeian had been sailing the fog-suffocated seas near the Gulf of Gunthak on the Thorn of the White Rose when they heard that Clan Broken Skull invaded Grobb and took the Grozmok Stone. &#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In all of their adventures over the years, the story of the Grozmok Stone surfaced several times. Both of the seafaring friends were well aware of what the stone represented and that it might be capable of shifting the weight of power in Norrath. Morden vowed to find the Grozmok Stone and hide it forever to keep all of Norrath safe from the rule of evil gods.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Morden and Nedaria and a small crew of seven trusted adventurers sailed into the Gulf of Gunthak hidden by a thick veil of fog. Nedaria sat up on the bow with her mind keenly focused, eyes closed. It wasn't long before she opened her eyes and nodded to Morden.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"They are close. Everyone should be at the ready," Nedaria whispered, her words gliding on the heavy, still air. "They have it -- they have the Grozmok Stone."&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In minutes, the crew of the Thorn of the White Rose heard the unmistakable creak of a strained hull rolling lazily through the water. Morden crouched, ready to spring as soon as the approaching boat crossed the bow of his ship. Two crewmates waited behind Morden, waiting for his commands.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The figure of a rickety ship with tattered sails emerged from the fog, eerily outlined like smudged charcoal on a gray canvas. Shadowy hulking figures moved about the boat -- clearly trolls -- who did not notice the ship coming into view on their starboard side. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Morden turned to the two behind him and nodded, pointing to the midship rail on the troll's boat. His crew nodded and waited for Morden's first move.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The decrepit boat inched past the bow of the Thorn of the White Rose. When the boat was in position, Morden silently leapt from the bow of his boat onto the railing, staying perfectly balanced on the three-inch rod of rusted iron. His crew followed. They all kept low and moved silently until they were close enough to smell the rotting reek of trolls' breath. Morden's crew flanked him.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Morden jumped down from the upper deck into the cockpit at the stern of the vessel and let loose a mighty bellow. The shock of his yell stunned the ten trolls that milled about the boat long enough for the blades of Morden and his crew to reduce them all to heaps of blood and gore.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"Ye stay 'ere, hm? Keep an eye on things while I go take a look in 'er hold," Morden said to his crew. "Yell if ye see something odd."&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In less than a minute, Morden returned with a grin. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"How blasted stupid do ye have to be to 'ide a big bloody slab o' stone in burlap?" Morden grinned to his curious crewmates. "There it were, standing right in front me. Gonna need some 'elp luggin' it o'er to me boat."&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;After the Grozmok Stone was safely hidden on the Thorn of the White Rose, Morden made his crew promise never to speak of it again. The stone was never to be sold or uncovered lest it unleash a power that could bring Norrath into the hands of the evil gods and races.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As for the contradictions a docked boat doesn't move.&amp;nbsp; Plus&amp;nbsp;when you yell and make lots of noise in attacking a docked ship you're not going to have to tell anyone to watch for anything odd due mainly to the fact that all the others in the dock are going to be going to the disturbance and summarily attacking you.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;One is an ambush the other is an attack on dulak.&amp;nbsp; One involves surprising a passing ship, and the other involves attacking a docked boat.&amp;nbsp; They are very different stories, in fact the only things they have in common aside from Nedaria and Morden is the fact that the Grozmok stone was on a boat.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As far as the Katta/Seru mission, the fact that there is NO mention whatsoever anywhere outside this monster mission&amp;nbsp;that Katta and Seru EVER dueled each other would be what I would say supports it.&amp;nbsp; That would be a very very big deal especially considering the huge impact such a thing would have had on the entire Combine Empire.&amp;nbsp; And maybe Katta was really really forgiving, and invites people that challenge him to a duel to the death to dinner parties.&amp;nbsp; The ONLY monster mission I've done that is anything more than a retelling or&amp;nbsp;story/play of, or fantasy about a previous event is the Pirate MM given in BBM where you plunder Freeport.&amp;nbsp; That is because it is presented as you going and joining the pirates crew and going to do just that.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What I've been saying is that the monster missions are just about as true to the actual events as a lot of movies that are "based on a true story"&amp;nbsp;are.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, they have the most basic of the facts straight, ie the grozmok stone was on a boat, Seru&amp;nbsp;was against Katta and&amp;nbsp;tried to kill Katta, but what actually happened is changed to be more dramatic and entertaining as well as being more workable game wise.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I actually agree with you Xianzu, that most of these are more like "based on a true story" movies rather than being the actual idea of what definitely absolutely happened.&amp;nbsp; In most cases that is.&amp;nbsp; It's really up to the player to decide whether or not the individual "telling the story" kept close to the historical facts.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;For example, the Monster Mission &lt;EM&gt;Fall of Ilsallin&lt;/EM&gt; is not "based on&amp;nbsp;a true story", you're literally living out what happened in a dream sequence.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I think the Dain monster missions may be a bit exaggerated in some regards, or maybe they aren't, but they're an attempt to retell the highlights of each of the Dains.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It's best to approach them piece by piece, analyze them, and initially remain hesitant about their validity.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Speculate at first and try to guess if this "based on a true story" is historically accurate, like &lt;EM&gt;The Reckoning&lt;/EM&gt; or more fable, like &lt;EM&gt;Braveheart&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;If arena fighting was a part of the combine culture as the appearence&amp;nbsp; of the arena in ser as well as every racial city outside of katta suggest. Then it is entirely plausible that katta and seru met in combat in an arena and it was not considered civil war.&amp;nbsp; from the storyline of the poisoning&amp;nbsp; Katta&amp;nbsp; survived the poisoning in a coma. according to this mm it appears katta&amp;nbsp; eludes ser unscathed. it seems more of a&amp;nbsp; before it all came tumbling down scenario than an&amp;nbsp; alternate this is how the combine fell scenario. .. once again i would love to see the text the mission giver gives for the katta mission. hopefully i can&amp;nbsp; get back in the game soon</description>

&lt;P&gt;If Seru and Katta were to fight an epic duel because the two hated one another, it's very unlikely that Seru would resort to something as subtle as poisoning at a party he is intending.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If the extremely powerful Lord Inquisitor takes a physical opposition to the Imperator, then yes, civil war begins.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;that may be so but at the same token if seru had faced katta in a duel and failed to kill him he then of course would of had to resort to another method.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;is it a duel to the death in the monster mission or is it a duel where seru tries to kill katta by "accident" &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;I don't think you aren't understanding.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If this civilization was built in &lt;EM&gt;any way&lt;/EM&gt; around Rome (and the name Imperator certainly implies that) then the slightest hint of disloyalty in the sense that Seru was interested in the throne or leadership in any way would have resulted in his immediate purging.&amp;nbsp; Be it an assassination, be it him "slipping in the shower", be it him simply being outright exiled, Katta would not have tolerated his presence any more, something would have happened to him.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Monster Mission really just doesn't make any sense.&amp;nbsp; If I designed that mission, I'd have completely changed it, the point of the mission would've been you, the group, as guests.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You walk into the dining hall.&amp;nbsp; You sit down. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Then, Tsaph Katta walks in, has a discussion with the doorman, shakes his hand, and then he dies.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The mission then is Seru's Inquisitors and death squads storming into the dining hall and trying to wipe out the undesireables, and you have to fight your way out.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Lore indicates that Katta regarded Seru as a friend (with a differing mind) up until his &amp;quot;death&amp;quot; so a death duel between them prior to the banquet would be very unlikey considering that Katta held no documented grudge or misgivings against Seru at that time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;but a friendly duel would of been perfectly acceptable. and an oppurtunity for seru to attempt to kill katta, this is wha the mission has you stop. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I havent done the mission or seen the context the mission is given. if someoen would&amp;nbsp; paste this up it would certainly clarify the matter&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;People don't generally tend to die in Friendly duels.&amp;nbsp; Usually one has to go out of their way to kill someone in such a duel.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

soundness of this, began construction immediately. A test came three decades &#xD;
later, when a Giant scout followed one of our hunting parties back to our &#xD;
caverns and reported the location to the [&lt;b&gt;&lt;span **SMURF**"font-weight: bold;"&gt;Chieftain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;] of the Ice &#xD;

of Giants, only 250 or so. Glight was given the honor of leading the defense of &#xD;
the caverns and using his magical pickaxe, aptly named Snowchipper, he led his &#xD;
forces using hit and run tactics, felling many giants. With over half its forces &#xD;
dispatched, Slagd still managed to penetrate his way further into the cavern and &#xD;
would have made it to the city proper if not for the courageous act of [&lt;b&gt;&lt;span **SMURF**"font-weight: bold;"&gt;Glight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;].'&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

until he finally went down a passageway with no chance of escape. It was then &#xD;
that Glight triggered the cave in of the passage burying the remaining giant &#xD;
forces and that of Glight's as well under tons of ice and snow. To honor this &#xD;
act of self-sacrifice, Brell rest his soul, the cavern is known as Glight's &#xD;
Fall. As a result of the cave in, there looks to be a waterfall frozen in time. &#xD;
It is said his [&lt;b&gt;&lt;span **SMURF**"font-weight: bold;"&gt;ghost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;] still &#xD;

began to migrate into the caves. We do not know why they came, they just did. &#xD;
They turned out to be some of the most dangerous foes we have ever encountered &#xD;
as they used stealth and camouflage to attack their prey. Many a kin has fallen &#xD;
prey to them with only their shrieks of agony and terror to echo throughout the &#xD;
halls as notice of their deaths. This did not bode well for the remaining &#xD;
Coldain, so it was decided that this keep was to be abandoned. All but a few who &#xD;
refused to leave stayed. And those are our ancestors. We are the only Coldain &#xD;
left on this land. We have heard no word from the others and assume them &#xD;
gone.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

see them. Then there are the Stalagterrors. You may not realize they are there &#xD;
until they open their great maw to devour you as they wrap their frosty &#xD;
tentacles around you. A recent arrival have been the Ry`Gorr. They had started &#xD;
mining the tunnels and have not yet discovered our presence here for we kill all &#xD;

heard wailing sometimes in the dead of night. We think it is near the place of &#xD;
his death but we do not know for sure. None who have seen him dare speak of &#xD;
it.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr size="2" width="100%"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My interpretation is that after the safety of the Crystal Caverns was compromised Dain the First led the party to the Great Divide to clear a path for his people. He was the one who secured the foothold in the Great Divide the Coldain needed to begin constructing the city of Thurgadin. Subsequent to that, however, the Crystal widows invaded the caverns and it was Dain the Second who oversaw the construction of the city itself, after the death of his father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the city was established and to secure his borders with the Giants Dain the Second then led a raid into the heart of Kael itself, throwing his enemies into confusion for a time, but initiating the battles that took place under the reign of his son, Dain the Third.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't say Dain's Historian Duggans is in conflict with the other lore keepers of the city but there is room for interpretation for the timelines involved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
