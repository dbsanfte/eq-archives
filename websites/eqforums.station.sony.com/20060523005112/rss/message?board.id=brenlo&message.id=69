&lt;DIV&gt;There are times when we gamers forget the world around us .&amp;nbsp; We log into our internet worlds and play with our friends.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We have no regard for borders, ethnicity, religious differences, we interact as gamers.&amp;nbsp; We play together and form lasting friendships and bonds that, in general, have no regard for real world bias or separation.&amp;nbsp; We are each and everyone, a Hero in our worlds.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Rarely do real world events touch us all, we gamers.&amp;nbsp; While each of us has our own personal issues to deal with, rarely does something so egregious occur that it affects the entirety of our online communities, our internet families.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Yesterday our friends, family members and fellow gamers in London were wounded deeply.&amp;nbsp; The occasional ugliness of the real world has again reared it's head and caused pain.&amp;nbsp; Our friends were hurt in a manner that, unfortunately, has left scars on many of us the last half decade. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Let us, as gamers of the world, stand together with our friends and family in the United Kingdom.&amp;nbsp; Let us show our support for those among us, who are the latest victims of the world and its politics.&amp;nbsp; Whatever our beliefs, our credo, our country of origin, let us unite as a community of gamers and support those who are grieving.&amp;nbsp; Let us remember those we may have lost, remember them as the Hero's they were in our worlds, where we befriended them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To my friends and fellow gamers in the UK and elsewhere that were affected by this latest act, my thoughts, prayers and sympathies are with you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
