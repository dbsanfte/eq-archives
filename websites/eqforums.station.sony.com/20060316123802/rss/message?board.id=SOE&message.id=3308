      <description>&lt;div&gt;This is a post not about a customer service issue, but rather about a systemic customer service void.  SOE needs a new plan to provide higher quality customer service to its paying customers.  Kytherea, does SOE have any intention to review their failing customer service plan?  I need an answer to this question so that I may make an informed decision to how I wish to spend my money.  Based on your response or handling of this post, I will be able to decide.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;There was a thread on necrotalk, I'll find it when I go home, where a necro was awarded a surname from a GM event.  He changed his surname or lost it in a bug or something, and it wasn't an available option to him from his surname selections.  He petitioned to get it back..after contacting several GM's..he states &amp;quot;I'm missing the nifty surname I got (listed actual surname at this point, it was like Rising Sun or something) in a GM event could you give it back to me?  Well as wonders never cease, with &amp;quot;brilliant&amp;quot; customer service..they gave him his surname...Nifty.  Not exactly what was requested heh.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If that isn't a depiction of quality, I don't know what is.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Seriously.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;How long have so many people complained about THIS single issue.  You can have perfect class balance(which is nowhere even remotely close or possible), a great game that runs smoothly with close to zero downtime, etc.  Every other phase of EQ could run and play 10x better then it does now, and you'd still lose customers(albeit less) solely due to lack of customer service.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anytime it's brought up, people on EQ's on messageboards, lock the thread and regurgitate the same response as they did in 2004. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's rediculous to do that to paying customers.  Not really trying to flame or start a problem(I could do a better job of that).  It's just baffling to leave such a &amp;quot;void&amp;quot; for a large and previously successfull product.  The only reasonable conclusion to come to is:  You don't care about your customers.  Which is generally an unsuccessfull stance to base policy on.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Customer service response is in the eye of the beholder. If you request something and they agree with you then the response is great and perfect, if another time you request something and they turn you down then customer service is the&amp;nbsp;pits and is found lacking.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In the years I have been playing eq1, I have had to petition a number of times for issues from lost items, ninja looting, intentional training, accidently destroyed items. Some of the responses went my way some did not, now if I let my emotions dictate my response, on the refused petitions then cs response was lacking, if I look at it logicaly, then they did it within their rules and there was no issue. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Riddle me this - is this senario and response customer service lacking or customer service doing what they are supposed to?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Player&amp;nbsp;gets account "hacked" in the investigation by CS, it shows the player handed out the password to&amp;nbsp;their&amp;nbsp;officers of their guild, they in turn handed the information to a member to bot the player for something,&amp;nbsp;this player gave it to their friend to&amp;nbsp;use, their freind logged in the account and stripped&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The owner logs in and sees that all&amp;nbsp;their PP and droppable equipment&amp;nbsp;is gone, they petition. The petition is refused because&amp;nbsp;of a direct violation of the security policy. The player starts screaming about customer service lacking, but is it?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Like i mentioned, Customer service response is in the eye of the beholder&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Thanks for the patience folks!&amp;nbsp; Here is something from CS about CS support.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The in-game petition system is designed so that Customer Service can assist our customers with in-game issues in the most efficient manner and in the fairest way possible; the order they are received.&amp;nbsp; It is also designed to track all customer tickets and the details regarding them so there is documentation of the issue being petitioned and how this was addressed by the GM (it helps a GM greatly to resolve an ongoing issue if they have access to any notes on what was done before they received the petition).&amp;nbsp; CS also uses the data provided by petitions submitted in the different category types in order to identify new issues and to assign GMs to work on specific categories of petitions when necessary, with the goal of maintaining the fastest possible response times and the highest quality of service overall.&amp;nbsp; By analyzing the number of petitions in each category/subcategory, we can adjust our focus on the ticket queues and address your issues faster.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This is why it is required to submit a request for assistance through the in-game petition system for in-game issues instead of sending a request for help via email, the forums, or any other way.&amp;nbsp; If GMs were to address regular in-game issues in other manners, not only would customers be assisted out of turn in an unorganized fashion, the documentation and ticket information would be scattered across several systems and would slow down the process of helping customers tremendously.&amp;nbsp; For these reasons, it is very important not to circumvent the petition system.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If&amp;nbsp;you have complaints regarding the quality of service&amp;nbsp;you have received,&amp;nbsp;we ask that you&amp;nbsp;email &lt;A href="mailto:eqcs@soe.sony.com" target=_blank&gt;eqcs@soe.sony.com&lt;/A&gt; with the details of the complaint and the ticket number of the petition&amp;nbsp;you submitted regarding the original issue.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Very important note regarding this email address: This email address is not intended as an alternative method to the in-game petition system and should only be used for complaints regarding quality of service based on the following:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Rude, impolite, or inappropriate behavior of a GM &lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Inappropriate use of a template response&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Please understand that the resolution to the issue you originally petitioned about may not be changed as the intent of this point of contact is&amp;nbsp;to give&amp;nbsp;customers&amp;nbsp;a method to&amp;nbsp;report complaints so that CS Management can investigate and address any issues found.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Should you send a complaint to this email address, a CS supervisor will be investigating the actions of the GM for any inappropriate behavior and will take corrective action should they find a need, however decisions made by a GM acting in accordance with our policies will not be changed.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The &lt;A href="mailto:eqcs@soe.sony.com" target=_blank&gt;eqcs@soe.sony.com&lt;/A&gt; email address can also be used to offer feedback and suggestions regarding ways to improve our ticketing system.&amp;nbsp; Feedback and suggestion emails, while important to us and often quite useful, will most likely not receive a response.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

Template cut and paste answers, whilst saving time for your company alienates those that believe they have a legitimate grievance. Sometimes a problem cannot have a solution due to the rules, however a canned response gives people the impression that they have been given the brush off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make the responses personal and people will know that someone actually read their petition rather than keywords being intercepted and a canned response sent back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murril Merryweather&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rathe&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Here is why your in game petition system doesnt work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You give the ability to your CS reps to close the conversation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Point blank, you can't do that.  You ALWAYS answer with... do you have anything else?  And you wait for the CUSTOMER to say they are done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You have no idea how many petitions I hear about from my guildies that are simply resolved by &amp;quot;I can not help you...&amp;quot; and the topic is locked allowing no futher replies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sending emails is NOT valid.   Because the response emails are not always a person.  I've gotten back emails saying &amp;quot;You can not reply to this email address&amp;quot; with the same messages as in petitions.  Again, shutting the customer out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is also absolutely NO feedback to players regarding BUGS.  Because the /bug system is a vacuum.  I've had bugs in there for 2 years, while they may be in some bug queue on your end to look at, there is no way for players to know if you will EVER fix it.  And manytimes you don't.  All the /bug command does is give you the ability to lock any threads on these forums and petitions in game by saying Ohh thats a bug, use /bug.  Again customer has no choice but to accept it, regardless of the consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This system has been in place for YEARS.  And we were told point blank a few years ago that the petition ssytem lost petitions, maybe it doesnt today, maybe the /bug works.  Maybe developers actually see it.  But the CURRENT developers only fix the zones THEY KNOW ABOUT.  We couldn't get a bug fixed from GoD even if we tried.  The fact is, you are trying to dismiss as many customers as you possibly can so that you don't hear them.  Sorry, it is bad customer service.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>My main problem with customer service? It feels like nothing we say matters. Like no matter what we ask for the next expansion is never anything we wanted. Just kinda makes me mad that they never listen to people.  Fact that almost every petition is hotkeyed with maybe a little added text and they always close the petition right after never giving you a chance to respond. At first i liked the ticket petition system it was rather easier than waitting online forever after a petition for a GM. But after a while it became apperant that your never gonna actually talk to a GM about most problems now and while ticket system works for basic problems like accidently deleted this item and such. For any problem involving glitchs,bugs and such if you get denied what you were requesting they close the ticket right away. Never giving you a chance to even have a word with them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I do now, with any petition I make, is add a bit on the end that says if I get a canned response that has little to do with the problem that I will re-petition the same issue again and again. I have done this on 2 petitions since I got an unrelated response and petition closure. One petition went my way and the other didn't but at least I received some relevant action and a knowledgeable reply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree with the general feeling that GM's close petitions far far too frequently and allow no action other than to re-petition because you received an irrelevant response. From some petitons, I have also gotten the impression that English is not the first language of the person typing a reply, and that they have a generally poor knowledge of the game. Quite a few times friends have gotten a reply that a certain thing was impossible to do when they know for a fact it can be done, and have had to re-petition again and again until they reached someone who knew what they were talking about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;i'd certainly sacrifice speed for quality.  i couldn't tell you the number of petitions that didn't give a response even close to the subject i asked about, then the ticket closed with out a chance to /boggle at the offtopic answer, and rebuttle if i had more info to give or more questions to ask about the topic at hand.  i think it would be faster to have 1 quality petition, then say 6 seperate petitions that go no where.  would certainly take longer to answer each petition, but if the quality of the answer/help was in the reply from the gm's, then there would be less petitions per day, making it faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i haven't sent any lately, so these were all in the past.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If you request something and they agree with you then the response is great and perfect, if another time you request something and they turn you down then customer service is the pits and is found lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the years I have been playing eq1, I have had to petition a number of times for issues from lost items, ninja looting, intentional training, accidently destroyed items. Some of the responses went my way some did not, now if I let my emotions dictate my response, on the refused petitions then cs response was lacking, if I look at it logicaly, then they did it within their rules and there was no issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riddle me this - is this senario and response customer service lacking or customer service doing what they are supposed to?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player gets account &amp;quot;hacked&amp;quot; in the investigation by CS, it shows the player handed out the password to their officers of their guild, they in turn handed the information to a member to bot the player for something, this player gave it to their friend to use, their freind logged in the account and stripped it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The owner logs in and sees that all their PP and droppable equipment is gone, they petition. The petition is refused because of a direct violation of the security policy.

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I wouldn't even try, I'm not trying to make CS out to be the villian here, but to /ignore and disallow other departments from being a conduit to make complaints doesn't make sence. Even your local police dept, phone co. power co. cable co. has a place to go where you can talk to someone and at least KNOW that your complaint has been heard, with CS that is not the case. In this case we have to type in something and wait..for a canned responce that has yet..(for me at least) givin a resolution to the problem. Your point is noted in the fact that there are people that will try to exploit the system, we all know this. Does that mean that everyone has to suffer from these few....I do not believe so. The programmers are the ones that perpetuated this, therefor I feel they should be the ones explaining to me(or us) why I, and 3 of my guildies have lost flags. I do not think this is ever going to happen though. I have been just kinda ...&amp;quot;lurking&amp;quot; these past few days to see how all of this unfolds, and I will still lurk for the time being untill I feel that something is in the works to fix something that we all know has flaws. I am a loyal EQ fan, and will stay that way untill all hope is gone that EQ cares about me, and not just my money.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Purely my oppenion here, but I feel really bad for the mods having to deal with this mess, I dont think it is right that all of this is dumped in thier laps.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;and I am sorry for them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Izzy&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;P.S. Do I not have the ability to quote yet or am I just being lame and not seeing the quote action button?&lt;/div&gt;</description>
