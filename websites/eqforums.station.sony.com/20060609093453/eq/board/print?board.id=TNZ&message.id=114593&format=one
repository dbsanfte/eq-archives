				<DIV>Well, being a casual sorta solo type player, I was playing with the task system at low to mid levels. I really liked the little mini-quests, but a lot of 'em were pretty deadly if you didn't know what you were getting into. The experience was pretty good on the mid-level tasks, but the rewards weren't that great. Usually some minor plat.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I kept getting finding myself doing something or other in Runnyeye for some reason. Got to know the zone pretty well as a result.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>That's about the extent of my beta experience. Never made it to any of the high level zones accessed throught the PoK. Probably never get there with any of my live characters, either, so no loss. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></DIV>
