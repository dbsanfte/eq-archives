				<DIV>&gt;&gt; These spells have long cast times to ensure they are not used to escape a combat situation that has gone wrong. It keeps them different from evacs. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Yeah, that made sense years ago before the Exodus AA and before the Evacuate spell. As it is, unless you've already used Exodus, I can't see a Wizard keeping any evac spell up. And once Exodus is down, Evacuate is the only spell worth memming because it keeps you in the zone rather than porting you somewhere close. So since there's no real reason to use another spell to escape a bad situation, any casting time longer than that of Evac should be find for a port.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>A lot of the port spells take a rather long time to refresh after memorization, and some have just plain crazy casting times. PoK is 18 seconds IIRC. There's no reason for that.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>That said, if some of the core Wizard issues get addressed, they can raise the casting time on our ports to 60 seconds and I doubt any Wizards will complain. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></DIV>

However, if I want to gate to, say, Greater Faydark - that is 7 sec. And gating to Twiligh Sea is 10.5 sec.<br><br>Portals: If I want to evac my group, I can cast Evacuate (9 sec). There is usually no reason to evac to a different zone (there haven't been zones with unsafe succor points in a very long time), but there are evac spells for that too - to Nek, Fay, etc. Now why in the world would I want to portal out of combat instead of evacing? There is a very, very, very small chance of leaving party members behind on evac but nobody would ever portal instead of evac really - just for the reason of leaving the zone. And yet portal spells have casting times from 16 to 24 sec.<br><br>Translocate: If I were to TL somebody else out of combat (so that the mob that's killing them would kill me instead??), there is the basic Translocate spell (8 sec). TL them to Nexus instead of the bind point is 10 sec. But TL to PoK (and some other places) is 15 sec. Why? What possible purpose other than just being inconvenient can that serve?<br><br>None of those spells with extra long casting times are used to escape combat. They are used quite as intended - to transport groups and raids to and from perfectly safe places around the world. And that's where players' time is simply wasted for no real reason.<br></div>

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>While you're looking at the ports and TLs, would you object to making sure that if we can port or evac to a location (maybe not for Plane of Hate and Plane of Sky) we can also do the normal Gate, Group Gate, TL as well.&nbsp; I'm thinking primarily of Skyfire and Emerald Jungle, but there is also South Ro as well which would fit the criteria for needing Gate, Group Gate and TLs.
