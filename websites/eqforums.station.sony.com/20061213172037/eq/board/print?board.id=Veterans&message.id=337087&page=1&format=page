<P>So far, I am really enjoying my "away from EQ while this bug persists" time, my little gnome warlock is now in his mid teen levels. Also it has been awesome to really be only 2 clicks away from a game, rather than 2 clicks, and close to a minute waiting for a game.</P>
<P>Also no zoning, eventhough the seperate zones (by map) are easily as large as everquest zones. The voidwalker is a really nice pet though I must admit, I like the look of my warder more than his look, but at least this warlock I can heal without going splut, so at the moment the warlock is a hell of a lot more fun to play than the beastlord.</P>
<P>Ahh, well 7 more free trials days left, before I decide which subscription to continue, surely they'll have fixed this issue before that, so I can go back to my good old troll, I do miss his crack (And not talking about Spiritual Ascendance either) ;-p</P>

				<DIV>heh... the old fix it or I am going to play another game tactic. I assume a fix is coming as Rashere said the change was unintended. I wonder if Rashere even knew that heals on pets didnt generate agro for the heal prior to the patch. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>As far as a "gimp" warrior tanking 3 mobs in direwind and holding agro off the cleric feverishly healing the warrior, well thats just a huge exageration of reality isnt it? No gimp tank is going to stand up long enough for heals to land.&nbsp; Trust me, I have seen a few "gimp" tanks die on one mob in direwind hehe. Even if they could stand up to that beating, an AOE taunt wouldnt hold agro over the kind of healing that would be necessary to keep the tank standing. Could an uber geared tank do that? sure.&nbsp; A gimp tank? No way.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I find it amazing that a mage pet can take hits from 2 direwind mobs at once in stride and allow a healer to keep it standing long enough to finish both mobs off.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is clear that mage pets are far and away the best pets in the game. I know my beastlord pet couldnt handle one mob in direwind beating on it for any real length of time. Heck, most low to middle geared pc tanks couldnt handle that really. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I dont think a pet heal should be agro free. I just dont agree with that concept. Healing gives major agro in most situations from level one up until high end. Heck if the main tank goes down on a raid, clerics start dying if the ST hasnt built sufficient agro to avoid that situation. Agro free pet heals just remove that consequence from the equation. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Looking at it from a mage's perspective this is a huge change to the game. No other pet class can use its pet to tank mobs in current content really. I can see why mages would be upset over this kind of change.&nbsp; I just had no idea that pet heals were agro free prior to this patch and I dont really understand why they should be. I dont see a rational basis for breaking a basic concept in the game. Heals generate agro. It is a balancing concept, that requires finese to overcome. Without heal agro from a pet heal, a healer faces no consequences no matter how much mana they burn in spamming heals on the pet. If the pet dies, and the healer doesnt heal the mage owner of the pet, the healer simply walks away with no place on the mobs' hatelist? Despite all the hitpoints healed? It just seems wrong to me.</DIV>

Just because something works differently for pets than it does for you doesn't make it a **SMURF** EXPLOIT, it just makes it different. Here's one for you, bards can run around while using clickys and potions and melee and outside of being stunned won't be interupted. **SMURF** thats so unfair they should have to hold still like everyone else. Please at least think a little before you fly off then handle and start coming up with end of the world theories if this is fixed back to what it has been for YEARS now.<br></div>

				<DIV>I dont think anyone really "flew off the handle" here. We just dont think pet heals should be no agro heals.&nbsp; But it doesnt matter what we think, SOE will fix this and things will be just as they were before. I think the most out of hand reaction has been from mages who over-react when people question why the heals should be no agro. Perhaps its just apprehension of the nerf bat or fear that there is some rationale for questioning this aspect of pet heals?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And the point about "gimp tanks" was taken from a mage who suggested, actually suggested that a gimp tank could hold agro and stand up to three mobs in dire, so why shouldnt a mage pet stand up to that? I didnt think he was talking about a gimp raid geared warrior and I still dont.</DIV>

<P>"As for pets not doing a lot of damage, that is nonsense, magicians are severely crippled without their pets. New pets can reach 300 - 400 + sustained DPS, without that the magician simply can't compete and should be left out of the raid."</P>
<P>I don't think my pet does that much damage, qvic focus, level 74 earth pet--I am crippled without him but not because of his dps.&nbsp; Its because he is my tank and holds&nbsp;a lot of my nuke aggro&nbsp;with his taunting. &nbsp; I crit over 10 k, that is where my damage comes from--the piddling extra damage from the pet is nice, Raging Servant is great when GoM procs (that is definitely 400 plus dps).&nbsp; But&nbsp; how do you get 400 damage per second from a normal pet?&nbsp; He hits something like 150--though I really don't care that much if he holds the aggro and lives, lol.&nbsp;&nbsp;Average hit goes down on raid mobs too btw.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>I definitely still do a lot of damage without my pet on a raid--I just can't help offtank adds, I can't assist chanters for mez, and I can't nuke quite as hard without pulling aggro maybe, although on raid mobs, warriors build some good aggro with their proccing, pets unneeded for that I suppose.</P>

<P>"How can one "make sure" that every pet class on one's raid has pet hold?&nbsp; The only way I can think other than believing what the person tells you is to either require all pet classes to have premium magelos or else pay for premium EQ Players oneself.&nbsp;"</P>
<P>You're a raidleader and you don't check up on the AAs and gear of problem players (having trouble doing their part well on a raid)?&nbsp; </P>
<P>You&nbsp; choose to lead raids without using premium eqplayers info?&nbsp; I love this tool to help figure out what is going wrong when something is going wrong.&nbsp; To evaluate apps who are new or may need some training, etc.</P>
<P>I got a heads up that one necro didn't know what he was doing when I checked on him on eqplayers, as he wasn't doing too well on raids, and was unable to solo (a necro...), and I found he'd spent many of his less-than-100 AAs on random stats, including strength, and wisdom (wisdom???), while not working his critting AAs, etc.&nbsp; He didn't know what he was doing as a necro at all.&nbsp; Obviously.</P>
<P>We tried to teach him and give some input since he didn't know what he was doing (we work with people if possible), and although in some cases training helps people and they take off and become good, in his case, he was unwilling to learn--too proud--so he's gone, our content is too hard for a necro who spends his AAs on wisdom first and won't take input, lol.</P>
<P>You have to figure out the exact reason for problems to solve them, that's reality.&nbsp; Especially raiding.&nbsp; Not using any info you have to do that seems odd.</P>
<P>Premium is cheap.</P>

<P>"The true issue on this thread, is that you dont want to garner any aggro at all so that your pet can tank multiple mobs while you or someone else heals it."</P>
<P>You're right,&nbsp;pets having different rules than players is so unfair.&nbsp; Just as healing pets should get aggro for the healer on the&nbsp;socially-aggroed adds,&nbsp;pets should get all the player tools to deal&nbsp;with thereafter holding the heal aggro (higher than social aggro) on said adds,&nbsp; or regaining it once aggro is lost.&nbsp; AE taunt, weapon affinity AAs for&nbsp;aggro proccing, etc.,&nbsp;so the adds don't go kill the mage and healer if you respond to the heal aggro appropriately with the pet!&nbsp; Excellent plan.&nbsp; &nbsp; And&nbsp;also, from now on, pets&nbsp;can have a setting to take aggro over players with less aggro in melee range, I think that is so far, good call.</P>
<P>Why didn't we think of this before?</P>

<P>"As for pet push.. I can sit on one side and&nbsp; bear on other and it will not move at all.&nbsp;"</P>
<P>Do you have all the pet flurrying AAs?&nbsp; Near as I can tell those are the ones generating the push.&nbsp; How about those swarm pets, such cute PUSHY little buggers, lol--I USE them to push some places because they're so good at it.&nbsp; But of course I have also finished all pet AAs,&nbsp;I didn't used to notice it as much, must be something in there then that makes push go over the top.&nbsp;</P>
<P>I know mage and bst pets push like crazy, anyone who doesn't have their pet AAs all finished probably can't speak to this as well as those who have finished them can--pet push is extreme.&nbsp; Bst can control theirs because they're right there on the mob--mages need to stand still far away, not doable for them-pet off is what you have to control push basically.&nbsp; Not talking about cornering or walling, I'm talking about when you have a mob you're killing for a while in the open that needs to stay where he is.&nbsp; Pets are bad in such cases, period.</P>
