Ramp usually hits most melee till they get the ranged downed anyhoo.

Mana burn, flare and blaze is last resort sort of stuff.<BR><BR>

<P><BR>Two top wizzies in my guild say they&nbsp;rarely run oom anymore, and they regularly are criting for 20-36K.</P>
<P>The more I thought of it last night, the op was right, you are not going to get your casters in range do do the damage, so realistically the most you are going to do is 45K of damage on a one shot deal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at the damage a zerker, monk, shammy's panther, wizzy, nec, mage dishes out in a typical raid 3-7 minute fight and&nbsp;20-25&nbsp;people meleeing&nbsp;x 1680 damage or 45K is not that much damage. I think the person who posted this was not even considering raids when they did so, as I was not until Prathun responded.</P>
<P>Still we got so many issues now, while I'ld like to see the duration and/or the max damage cap eliminated (or some combo thereof (ie 5 minute duration with higher cap, 3 minutes with no cap, whatever),&nbsp; we got so many bug fixes, behind the time spell set, missing spells, aa usefulness and cost issues, debuff&nbsp;and dps issues that I would lke to see those addressed (granted some adjjustment to this spell is in order as it is too limited and wimpy to be used as is 95% of the time.</P>
<P>Don't expect Prathun to respond to the requests guys, just hope he read through the rest of the threads and hopefully past the infighting/vendetta wars to the meat that is in there.</P>
<P>To the shammy who tried to compare SotQ vs Equinox burn, your post was already concisely responded too.&nbsp; Load two different nukes and&nbsp; wahlaa!!!&nbsp; Should we also mention the dot comparison, the fact you got a "decen" pet?</P>
