      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Stromm&amp;message.id=733#M733</link>
      <description>Rise of the Ungulates is a newly formed guild looking for talent to help lead us forward. We currently need talented people who are looking to progress through the Planes of Power progression. We will work as a guild to improve our raiding skills and gear to further our progression. We have a Ventrillo voice server and a dedicated management team in place to make sure the guild is moving the the right direction. We just need soldiers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We also allow guests to come on our raids, provided they have registered to come on our website at http://riseoftheungulates.guildportal.com/&amp;nbsp; Guests receive 4/5ths the DKP of a full member but may bid and beat members, provided they have more DKP. Please stop by and check out calendar to see if we are having any convenient raiding days scheduled for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Dawn of  New Era Recruitment</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Stromm&amp;message.id=728#M728</link>
      <description>Dawn of a New Era is a casual raiding guild that is currently raiding twice a week (Tuesdays and Fridays). Most of our players are in the central time zone. We are looking for new talent to fill our roster. You do not need any previous raiding experience to join us, you just have to be willing to learn. We have beating on Luclin endgame pinatas recently and are making them spill their loot all over. The guild is also going to move swiftly through Planes of Power (we have allready started early flagging for it) as soon as we are done plundering Vex Thal for all it is worth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dawn of a New Era is a DKP style guild that rewards the players that put in the most time at raids (it is really hard to fall behind much with our current 2 raids a week). We have a system in place to prevent inflation, where the all DKP spent at a raid is redistibuted back to the members who attended the raid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are currently recruiting level 65+ players (though exceptional cases can be made). Please visit http://dawnofanewera.guildportal.com to apply, or feel free to contact: Lamdon, Aendail, Ishaca, Opaquely, Haneysma or Lefurjah in game for more questions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Stromm&amp;message.id=720#M720</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Are there any guilds on Stromm that do a lot of day time (EST) grouping and/or raiding? I generally can play from about 9 or 10 AM EST until 4PM EST. My main is a level 68 Nec with about 200 aa's. I am looking for a guild where i can grow the toon, greatly improve his gear, and start doing DoDH spell missions, MPG trials etc. I have been playing for less than a year so it has taken me some time to elarn my class well, but I am ready and willing to learn the high end now if anyone can steer me somewhere that I can have the chance to do it.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Sarinth's Saturday Afternoon Raid ~ PoP Progression</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Stromm&amp;message.id=714#M714</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarinth's Saturday Aftternoon Raids - SSAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meeting Location:&lt;/b&gt; In Plane of Tranquility outside of the CoD caves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Target:&lt;/b&gt; To be announced. I will employ scouts to each zone to determine what is up, poll the raid @ 11:45 A.M. EST for needs, and decide upon that as well as other factors. Basically, any Pre-Elemental that is up has the chance to get smacked down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raid Start Time:&lt;/b&gt; We move out at 12:00 Noon EST / 9:00 A.M. PST. Please be at the Meeting Location 15 minutes prior to start time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raid Leader:&lt;/b&gt; Sarinth - of course.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Back-up Raid Leader:&lt;/b&gt; To Be Announced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Level Requirements:&lt;/b&gt; 55+&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Required Items/Abilities:&lt;/b&gt; Healing Spells/Potions, Shrink Spell/Device, Invisibility Spell/Device&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Main Raid Chat:&lt;/b&gt; /rs - Please keep /rs free of any chatter during the raid. Any chatter should be reserved for the General Chat Channel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;General Chat Channel:&lt;/b&gt; /join ssarbackflag&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raid Channel for Healers:&lt;/b&gt; /join ssarheal&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raid Channel for Tanks:&lt;/b&gt; /join ssartank&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Loot Rules:&lt;/b&gt; All loot is Need Before Greed. All NO DROP loot except EP'S &amp;amp; SP'S will be, /ran 1000 where it drops, one item per person per raid, unless not wanted by anyone else. Any EP'S or SP'S and other non-NO DROP Stat Items will be looted by the main looter and /ran 1000 after the raid. The one item per person per raid rule is still in effect. Which means, if you received a NO DROP item during the raid, you will not roll on any items after the raid unless no one else needs the drops.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sarinth's Expectations:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;LISTEN&lt;/b&gt; - Listening to directions coming from /rs is an integral part of a successful raid. Anyone found to be a habitual offender of this request, will have repercussions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO NOT SPEAK IN /RS&lt;/b&gt; - Ties in with the first one. If people are chatting in this channel, then it is much more difficult to pick out the needed instructions. Anyone found to be a habitual offender of this rule will have repercussions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO NOT ARGUE&lt;/b&gt; - Arguing with the Raid Leader, Back-Up Raid Leaders, or Designated Class Representatives in public forums (/rs, /ssarbackflag, etc.) will instantly get the boot, basically, send a tell. No if's and's or but's on this subject.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;SHRINK&lt;/b&gt; - Keep yourself maximum shrunk. Exceptions to this rule are the tanks so the raid &amp;amp; especially raid healers can have optimal visibility of the person they need to heal/assist/look after/etc.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Stromm&amp;message.id=701#M701</link>
      <description>Just wanted to say thank you to a member of seekers of laughter. A few nights ago I was minding my business, medding after sendng many spiders, bats, skellies &amp;amp; goblin warriors to their final glory when I notice myself feeling faster, stronger &amp;amp; other descriptors as well. Now this was not asked for but it was much appreciated. I am a halfling druid in my 11th season (actually 12 now) with the same enhancements, but far less effective. So, thank you for saving me the mana (which takes awhile to regain) and allowing me to experience a bit more power than normal. I enjoyed our conversation and appreciate your kindness. Congratulations on finding another piece for your epic. If the other members of your guild are as generous and gracious as yours then it must indeed be a fine group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And to others who may have provided run-by-enhancements, i thank you as well. Time is a precious thing, and at my current stage i spend a fair amount of time regaining mana. It is much appreciated! It allows me to protect rivervale from spiders, rats &amp;amp; bats! :-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a veteran of 2 1/2 months to the game (okay, a newbie) i find it refreshing how many people are helpful &amp;amp; friendly in this world!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saibbo,&lt;br&gt;12th season Halfling Druid&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

I was wondering if any guilds are activly recuiting at mo. I am a 51 warrior wilthout epic/don or dark. I play for about 1-2 hours weekdays and 3-5 hours weekend days. I prefer a casual guild where there is no pressure on you to do this or do that. Send a whisper or post a reply. P.s my toons name is Raknruin.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hey stromm, hows it going?&amp;nbsp; I've just started playing EQ and I am a total newbie to the game.&amp;nbsp; I'm an avid MMO player having played AC/AC2/SWG/WoW and a few other games but never played EQ in all that time.&amp;nbsp; Well I've become bored with WoW for the most part so I am going to try this out and see how it goes.&amp;nbsp; I'm looking for a newb friendly guy who might be able to answer my questions and give advice when they have the chance.&amp;nbsp; I usually pick up the game fast and then hopefully I'll be just like any regular old member.&amp;nbsp; If you think you might be able to help, let me know :)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Attn: West Coast Players</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Stromm&amp;message.id=667#M667</link>
      <description>After having some frustration finding West Coast-time players/cooperation here on Stromm, at both lower and higher levels, I wanted to put the feelers out for getting similar players together for grouping, or starting a new guild from the ground up, with players on a similar timeframe.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Send me an email at:  groundviking@hotmail.com   if anyone out there has interest and would like to start collecting players for adventuring during Pacific Standard Time.  Its a great game, but great grouping and guilding make it so much more rewarding, especially when your allies adventure on your timetable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If there just isnt enough support for such a dedicated effort, then at least I'll know there isnt a mass of people on this server looking for groups/guilds during the same play hours as myself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rivic</description>
