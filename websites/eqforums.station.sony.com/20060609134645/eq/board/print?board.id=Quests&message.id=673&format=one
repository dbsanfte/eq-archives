				<DIV>Been playing 6th lvl Rogue on Stormhammer.&nbsp; Questing for newbie armor and quest requires desert spiderling hairs.&nbsp; I've never seen a desert spiderling....ever.&nbsp; I've been playing for hours in the norther desert of Ro.&nbsp; I've been told that's where they are.&nbsp; I've killed several dune spiderlings but no desert spiderlings.&nbsp; Don't know what the deal is.&nbsp; I mean it's not a matter of killing the spiders and they aren't dropping the hairs.&nbsp; There just aren't any desert spiderlings. I give up please tell me if I can't complete the quest or that there are desert spiderlings somewhere.</DIV>
