      <description>&lt;div&gt;I really wish they'd just start putting them all on DVD. Honestly, if your computer doesn't have a DVD drive, chances are you have no business thinking it'll handle an MMO.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'd also much enjoy new expansions coming complete with the newest patch updates to cut down on the pre-play time. Seriously, I patched for about 75 hours for EQ when I reactivated, about 45 for EQ2, and an ungodly 120 or so for CoH.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;the can place it on dvd, but thinking that it will cut back on the patch time is not logical. Given the lead time required to create a master production disk, ship it to the procesing factory, make the pressing run, QA it, set it to packaging, stage for distribution, ship from distribution point to the warehouses of the retail outlet, cross ship fromt eh retail outlets distribution points to the actual outlets, have the boxes stocked on the shelves, it will be out of date anyway</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not nearly as out-of-date as it would be installing, say, Titanium from the box. It really would cut down patching time a lot, as there would be far fewer files in need of update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to mention that the optional and revamped zones REALLY need to start being included with comprehensive releases like Titanium. That would cut out several hours right there on dial-up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Actually it wil be exactly the same. Titanium is the lastest release of install media for the game. If you installed that one you still have to patch everything that was changed since that particular release went to the pressors.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Unless you are saying to release a new press everytime the game is release for purchase - that would be cost prohibitive. On a dynamicly updating game live a MMORPG, you have ot deal with changes from the pressing, no way around it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Question you mention - "revamped zones" in specific - how do you reconcile Nek forest, it went from the original to the version 2.0 that it is now and shortly it will be version 3.0 that is currently running on test and will be moved to live shortly - which one do you include on the currnt press of the product?&lt;/P&gt;</description>

But I absolutely do not believe they've updated so many zones since Titanium's release, so I don't buy that the files were current as of release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revamped zones, which version? The one current when the boxed set goes to pressing, obviously. And the optional zones I don't think anyone should have any argument against.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;As a general trend, you will see more and more games on DVD because they can put more info on the disks.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>The game itself is no different.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have a DVD drive in your computer, that'd be recomended.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But SoE knows that not everyone has a DVD drive in their computer, so they have an installer that's CD based as well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I believe it's 10 CDs that would have to be swapped in, in order to install it (vs. the 1 DVD).</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;This hits the nail in the head.&amp;nbsp; It took me forever to install EQ2 from the CDs, because I was constantly swapping them.&amp;nbsp; I'd have loved to put in a DVD and just let it run, and come back in an hour when it was finished.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>It would be really nice if they included a full DVD version of the game with an upcoming expantion including realitivley new patches.  Its really a pain to install disc after disc after disc...&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Both EQ and EQII do not tie into the registry; they (other than shortcut launcher icons) are completely contained within their respective directories. (3rd party programs that you add on to EQ/EQII, like that popular EQII map program, may make registry settings, so be aware of that)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What this means is, that if you have a burner (CD or DVD; DVD works better) you can just back up your EQ/EQII directories to CD(s)/DVD(s). Next time you have to reinstall, copy the directories from the disc's you burned (remember to reset the READONLY flags; if you use a backup program to make hte disks it might handle that stuff for you), and you will be all set to go from the point you made the back up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That would get you EQ on DVD's, and a relatively recently patched EQ to start from as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(If you don't have a burner but have other ways to back up, like removable harddrives, or backing up to another machine on the networks, that would work as well)</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's hardly any work compared to the time waiting for it to download.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to buy it from the store, you may as well just go to:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://help.station.sony.com/cgi-bin/soe.cfg/php/enduser/fattach_get.php?p_tbl=9&amp;p_id=16165&amp;p_created=1134756016"&gt;http://help.station.sony.com/cgi-bin/soe.cfg/php/enduser/fattach_get.php?p_tbl=9&amp;amp;p_id=16165&amp;amp;p_created=1134756016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even things like EQ Titanium usually contain the pre-beta (aka really unfinished) files for the expansions.&lt;/em&gt;  If you buy the CDs, you would be downloading almost everything over again anyway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now if they released a *new* up to date DVD I could see what you're getting at, but if you have a DVD burner a simple copy of the Everquest folder in Program Files would be a backup you could just copy back (and unflag read only as has been said).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Zunnoab-Stromm on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;05-08-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;12:53 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;One requires you to have a DVD rom in addition to having a CD rom.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is generally because of things like opening movies, credit movies, or special features on CDs.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
