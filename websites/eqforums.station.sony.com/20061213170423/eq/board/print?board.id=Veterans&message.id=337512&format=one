				Of course, the loot was good, the AA was very nice, and there was a shot at a spell.&nbsp; These are all solid reasons to do them.&nbsp; That said as a raidier I never looted any items from them, cause I didnt need them.&nbsp; I got all my spells elsewhere as well.&nbsp; I however have done them all several times.&nbsp; They are excellent, reliable, events that you can/could do altho the lockouts could be annoying for the ones you werent doing hehe.<br><div></div>
