<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>First let me say, that I have for a long time, thought the whole flagging system was inequitable and a horrible idea. Unfortunately however, they are here to stay. Way too many people have spent way too many months getting flagged to just be told that all their efforts were in vain and were not required.</DIV>

<DIV>The current solution seems reasonable. However, people who have never gone through planar progression should not get a free ride. There should be semi-substantial&nbsp;soloable or groupable quest&nbsp; required in addition to the item, to get the flags. Giving&nbsp;them to people for free would be a slap in the face to everyone who worked though planar progression through pickups.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>So how do you compensate the people who have gotten their flags through pickups?&nbsp;One way to accomplish this is to make flags account based instead of character based. That would allow all of someone's alts to be, in a sense, backflagged.&nbsp;There are many benefits to this approach for both guild raiders and pickup raiders. Unfortunately, it does not address multi-boxers, but I am not sure how to do this without creating an exploitive situation.<BR></DIV><BR>

<P>It has probably been mentioned before but i can't be bothered reading all the posts.</P>
<P>The <EM>reward</EM> is for doing all the planar progression is that you get a rather nice charm slot item. The folks that only do the backflag don't get any of the charm increases. The only <EM>reward</EM> for doing the back flag loot is that you can now get into PoFire/PoW/PoE/PoS without a raid.</P>
<P>It is quite literally a backflag - not a method for guilds to "leapfrog" the progression, unless some other guild deliberatly invites them along to loot.</P>
