    <title>Also in a guild war</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=18047</link>
    <description>Yeah way back when, pre kunark, I also was in a guild war. I was like level 20 at the time and it was my first PVP fighting. We all got together in North Ro I think and went at it. I got my ass handed to me by higher levels, but it was fun and I made a few friends in the opposing guild.</description>
