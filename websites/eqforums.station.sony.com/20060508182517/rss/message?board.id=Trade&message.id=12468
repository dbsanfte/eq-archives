&lt;DIV&gt;There is currently a limit of 15000 recipes that can be learned TOTAL across all skills.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There is a total of 500 recipes that can be "Favourited" TOTAL across all skills.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;At the fan fair it was brought up that there were some problems "learning" recipes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Was it a problem with learning at all so you can search for it?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Or was it that you could not add it to favorites.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If only favorites, then you need to delete some as there is no current plan to change that.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If it was learn at all so it can be searched for... well it is entirely possible that you have filled up the list as there are&amp;nbsp;18000 learn-able recipes....&amp;nbsp; I will be looking to get that number changed as soon as feasible.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Well, I am not quite sure what your looking for but here was my experience last night on Test Server and it seemed to be rather noticably different from the previous characters I had run through this routine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have taken the route of doing Short Ale to 50, doing the Test, then using Ol'Tujim's Fierce Brew.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now I have never been able to find that formula via search.  I have always needed to experiment / learn it.  This is probably the 3rd (2 from the test) that I need to learn.  Eventualy I will learn Minitour Hero's Brew.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, it took me nearly 40 (+-5) combines to eventualy learn the formula.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now other than the bother of putting the ingredients into the combine box, this was no big deal as I was gaining skill ups anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the previous (8 or 9 characters), I would learn the formula in about 10 tries or less.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My experience is that after the first successful combine - you have learned the item and it shows up in the search bar.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps I have just been lucky, but that seems an odd bit of luck if that is the case.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;And when really paring it down, a Gnome Rogue can learn about 11k recipes, and is the most.&amp;nbsp; So no-one can currently exceed the 15k limit.&amp;nbsp; Though I believe we are getting close enough to look into upping that number.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I've got a tricky one:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Do the old (now defunct) alchemy recipes that have been learned count towards that number?&amp;nbsp; Meaning if one has learned both the old and new alchemy stuff, those learned recipes are taking up space?&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Those were "automatically" deleted from players "learned" list (not necessarily favorites list)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And there was a question about more poison making recipes&amp;nbsp;than research.&amp;nbsp; The answer is yes because of the Augments that poison making (and Alchemy) can make.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
