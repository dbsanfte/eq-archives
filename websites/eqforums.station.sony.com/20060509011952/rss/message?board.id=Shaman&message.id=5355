      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have to say that I think Sloth and Plague are bot spells.  Not to mention a 25% slow is still going to be mitigated down to around a 10% or 15% slow on anything worth killing at level 70.  While anything that mitigates the mobs damage output is worthwhile, if there are alot of mobs, I'll go with vindictive, with its unmatched -100 MR check, ancestral guard and then have both Balances loaded (I think of them as &amp;quot;lure&amp;quot; slows) along with the TA.   While Plague is a 45% slow, it still rarely lands on mobs, and frankly an active shaman player can quickly get mobs slowed faster and better than HP (and probably better than sloth since it has to be buffed onto each player before engage, and experience has taught me you may not know when engage is, and planned MT and ST does not always equal actual MT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, imho, plague and sloth are one time cast spells that do what a live shaman can do faster and better, put in the game so that botters can cast once and get back to playing their main.  They were imho added to the game to feed the bots (feeding the bots = keep people paying for the additional account for their botted shaman).  In that sense, they are not useless to everyone, just to real live/non-botted shaman.  The one most benefiting from these spells is clearly Sony.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Aprry on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;03-16-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;10:26 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samanna, does that really make them any less bot spells?  As was posted earlier, why not just cast walking sleep and save 400 mana? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can do better than HP, and lingering sloth with VP and both balances and have done so on dodh queen raids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are bot spells.  I don't really mind sony feeding the bots, as long as I don't have to eat from the same trough.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Slow proc as an agro buff is worthless. Today's&amp;nbsp;Warriors have as many as 5 procs for agro already (2 inate weapon procs, 2 aug procs, 1 clicky&amp;nbsp;spell proc) and Paladins and Shadowknights hardly need a 25% slow to assist them with keeping agro of me.&amp;nbsp;I can cast Balance and 75% slow an exp&amp;nbsp;mob before it is even in camp and all three classes can snap agro it to them near instantly without this silly slow proc. I have yet to encounter an event where I thought "Man I wish I had another short duration buff to cast on my melee so they could slow the mobs 1/3 as well as I could."&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;haven't tried this at all, my shaman is way to low to go in the deepend about new spells in high end, but, with a slow proc that has high proc rate warriors(/zerkers) could rampage slow trains, and then fortitude/furious tank them wihtout being injured for 12 seconds. would be good for clearing raid trash; plough tanks could just pull off mobs off the warrior that does the rampage-slow-proc while he is fortitude.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;on side note: is it true slow reduces chance of quad attacks on mobs?  quick look at the hits mobs make it seems to be the case that they double instead of quad, but like i said its just a passing glance, so prolly not even true.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Having considered the situation at length, I am unable to come up with any encounter that I know about up to anf including anguish in which I would ever cast either of the two new slows.&amp;nbsp; In ever single case, I consider Vindictive Spirit ot Balance of Discord/Nihl to be superior spells.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If there are any such encounters, I challenge the developers to name three...heck, that's not fair, three is a stupidly high requirement.&amp;nbsp; Name one.&amp;nbsp; One single decent raid encounter where either of these two spells would be more useful that BoD/VS.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As a primary spell caster, in every previous expansion I have raced to get the new spells as fast as I can, because new spells&amp;nbsp;has always been more power.&amp;nbsp; I have no incentive to get the new spells for this expansion as they do not add any more power, they are in fact less powerful that what I already have&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I got this spell today..hmmmm now what do I do with it? I didn't plan on bothering to get any of these spells, but a cleric friend said she got a good one so&amp;nbsp;I helped her. All of mine are worthless. Why would SOE do that? Yes, I'm going to&amp;nbsp; say it, This is UNFAIR. Why give us spells we will never use?&amp;nbsp; I discord slow everything, why do&amp;nbsp;I need two more slows?&amp;nbsp; I also have an AE slow, so again ,why do I need two more slows? AE nuke? Hm, chanters will kill me if&amp;nbsp;I use that. Only good for farming. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I discord slow everything, so thats 1.5 seconds, which hardly gets resisted. Now why would need more slows that slow for much less? I don't want&amp;nbsp; new slows as I'm happy with balance of discord. Give me something I can use, like a 60% group haste (we already have the 60% single), a faster quick heal (make it around 1500 and 2.0 sec) so I can keep the cleric/druid from dieing, and a faster nuke (ice age cast is too long). &amp;nbsp;I don't want to be a mainhealer, I just want to keep the healer alive and do a quick patch heal when needed.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Maybe you should look outside the box at what the intended reason for each spell might be.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'll mention Lingering sloth.&amp;nbsp; What you see on the surface is a spell that's only 25% of a slow.&amp;nbsp; So why would you want to use it.&amp;nbsp; Ever heard of first agro?&amp;nbsp; Cast this buff on a tank.&amp;nbsp; It lasts for approx 5 min (4.1 base time) and it procs a lot.&amp;nbsp; Shaman have for a long time whined about wanting to be the main healers in a group.&amp;nbsp; A lot of the talk wasn't just about how we couldn't function as one because our heals were too slow and&amp;nbsp; wouldn't heal enough, but also because if we were the main healer, we wouldn't be able to slow the mob in time to get the first heal off.&amp;nbsp; Malos is a 5 second base casting spell (3.4 for me with my focus' and blessing of devotion from a cleric) and combine that with a 3 second casting slow (TA is three second, or 2.1 using the spell, add another second for spell gems refreshment) and you have a tank that takes at almost 10 seconds of dmg before a heal can be cast on the tank....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;However, add the sloth buff to the tank and what does this do?&amp;nbsp; First off, it's based on disease resists, which normally equal less resists than our magic based other slows.&amp;nbsp; But, it also has a -50 resist modifier, making it extra easy to land.&amp;nbsp; Because the proc is based on the mob hitting the person, it's free agro for the tank, and a free slow and its very likely to go off the second that the mob hits the tank.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What this boils down to, is that the mob is then slowed by the tank faster than it would take you to cast slow on the mob.&amp;nbsp; This gives the shaman the ability to main heal in a group and not have to cast slow, or it gives the shaman the ability to main heal and slow, but you would&amp;nbsp; have a little bit extra time to land another slow, and more time to heal just in case it's needed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think that it's a very nice spell.&amp;nbsp; I use it periodically.&amp;nbsp; It enables me to take on a purely dps role in a group if I wanted to, althoug most of the time I cast my TA slow since it's free as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I can comment on the other slow, but I honestly do not use it a lot.&amp;nbsp; I have found one fight that it worked very nicely for, but other than that, I haven't seen one yet.&amp;nbsp; If you get any spell in DoD.. get Lingering Sloth.&amp;nbsp; It's very much worth it.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;If you think the use for this spell lies in getting a early slow on in exp groups to enable you to heal better, you are sadly mistaken.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A 25% slow that procs every&amp;nbsp;7 seconds on average isn't going to do a whole lot. You still have to slow the mob, just as if Sloth wasn't there or you'll end up falling behind, since our heals are balanced around a 75% slow. Second, the damage reduction from a 25% slow is miserable when you account for the mitigation and you have no guarantee it will go off before you actually landed your slow to begin with.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The obvious use for the spell is to slow multiple targets beating on your tank, but for that I might as well use Vindictive Spirit, which not only is more effctive(50%), but also lands much better. On top of that it will provide a mitigation buff up to 1600 HPs. See, this is the classic situation where one spell that terribly sucks, makes another spell, that has its issues and which I have pointed out in other threads, look incredibly good.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If a developer actually took the time to look into what Sloth effectively does in groups, they couldn't but up the effectiveness on it. We Shamans tend to be way too complacent or would you want to compare this spell's power with the Druid's reptile buff?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There are 2 possible changes that this spell requires to be of use, yet I doubt it will happen, because in today's EQ it takes a star lawyer to change things to the better once they go live:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) Up the % on Lingering Sloth to trigger to 75%. It only lasts 3 ticks, anyway.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2) Keep Lingering Sloth at 25%, mitigated, but make it stack with our other slows. Shamans have been asking for a less mitigated slow for a long time, adding another 12% would achieve the same thing, but require the mob to be vulnerable to magic and disease and to proc it constantly. If you were worried about trivializing content that does not contain slow mitigation, then put a hard cap on slows.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>While the new spells aren't exactly terrible, they are extremely situational in their current state. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hungry plague - Sounds like a great idea, but what if your first cast is resisted? As a shaman our spell gems are crucial, and we can't afford to dedicate a gem only to have it constantly grayed out for 120 seconds. (duration and recast hurts this)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lingering sloth - Sounds like a great idea, but what kinda duration is this? 5-10-15 min? I don't wanna dedicate a spell gem for another slow that has to constantly be refreshed. especially for the low % that it gives. (duration and potency hurts this)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Breath of Antraygus - This is a fun one, looks cool, but how come I can't hit the target 5 feet in front of me? With the iffy range on this spell, some of use would rather just use our rains. (wacky range and damage hurts this) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They are decent spells, good ideas, but they need fixing if they want to earn a place in our spell sets.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;If you wanted to keep the spells in their current form:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Hungry Plague would need a serious resist adjustment to counter the recast time and the aggro it generates. I dare to say it would have to be adleast negative 100 DR like Vindictive spirit is to magic.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Lingering sloth is such a joke of a spell. Given the fact that pretty much all mobs mitigate slow how can a 25% even be justified? I mean seriously Why not just throw walking sleep on the mobs instead saving over 400 mana? Lingering Sloth is a great idea but it would need to be upped to the 65% range or have it upped to a 35% range with a flag that makes mobs unable to mitigate the spell IMO.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Breath of Antraygus&amp;nbsp; could be a very strong spell but the range does seem a little spall. lucy has it listed at 75 feet.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The bottom line here is if these disease based slows are to even be considered worth adding to a shamans spell book they need to be as powerfull as , or adleast close to the magic line of spells. Currently it makes so sense to use these spells on any of the current content shamans face in game.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Once you infect a mob with Hungry Plague, he will spread it to others near him.&lt;br&gt;AFTER this happens, you can then cast Turgurs/Nihil/Discord on any of the infected mobs.&lt;br&gt;From there the 40% slow from Hungry Plague will be overwritten, and Turgurs/Nihil/Discord will begin to spread.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do NOT scoff at this spell because you do not like the 40% intial slow from it.&lt;br&gt;If hungry plague lands, you can basically slow everything in the area by 75% with one cast.&lt;br&gt;it just needs its recast/resist rate looked at.</description>
