<P><BR>The tormax guards should probably be raid flagged.&nbsp; When trying to retroactively flag 7+ years worth of content, some things are invariably going to be missed.&nbsp; Kallis falls into the border area.&nbsp; He's either a very tough single group NPC or a very easy raid one.&nbsp; I erred on the side of the group in this case for two reasons.&nbsp; 1) During Velious I was killing him with a single group.&nbsp; It wasn't easy, but it was doable.&nbsp; 2) When you think Kallis, you don't think raid mob like you do vindi or Tormax.</P>
