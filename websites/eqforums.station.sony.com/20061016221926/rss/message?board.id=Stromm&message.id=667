    <title>Attn: West Coast Players</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Stromm&amp;message.id=667</link>
    <description>After having some frustration finding West Coast-time players/cooperation here on Stromm, at both lower and higher levels, I wanted to put the feelers out for getting similar players together for grouping, or starting a new guild from the ground up, with players on a similar timeframe.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Send me an email at:  groundviking@hotmail.com   if anyone out there has interest and would like to start collecting players for adventuring during Pacific Standard Time.  Its a great game, but great grouping and guilding make it so much more rewarding, especially when your allies adventure on your timetable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If there just isnt enough support for such a dedicated effort, then at least I'll know there isnt a mass of people on this server looking for groups/guilds during the same play hours as myself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rivic</description>
