      <title>About those potions</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=12008#M12008</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Ok, so every melee class PK specialist is buying gate potions, snare potions, heal potions, SOW potions, etc so that they can add those abilities to their ability to melee.  In effect it gives them some of the key things that a caster can do PVP on top of all the things that a melee can do.  I have two suggestions short of removing these from the game that might help.  Don't know how hard these would be to implement, maybe Pinhead could comment:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suggestion1:&lt;/strong&gt;  Introduce &amp;quot;melee&amp;quot; potions.  If a melee can snare, and SOW, and gate, how about a potion that lets my pet quad for 500 and crit-hit for 2000 occasionally for two minutes?  That should even things up a bit.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suggestion2:&lt;/strong&gt;  Use the same skill check on potions that the underlying spell uses if cast.  If a spell typically uses alteration and you try to use a potion that casts that spell and you are a melee, your skill (obviously) will be zero.  Have them fizzle at the same rate that they would if a zero-skill caster tried to cast the same spell.  That should put enough risk in using the pots that people would think twice (or not use them at all) unless they were a caster who had the underlying skill.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some other things (such as procs on weapons) need a little tweaking too, I think.  I zoned in to Neriak yesterday and before I had control of my toon a monk started whacking me with a stick that dispelled every buff I had in a couple of seconds.  Faster than a caster could dispell someone of that many buffs, for sure.  I don't know if he just got a lucky string of procs or what, but if that stick always does that, it probably needs to be adjusted so that at the very least it can't be used to insta-debuff people at zone-lines.  If it procs a debuff, it should take the normal casting time for a debuff to work, and should be interrupted if he moves during that time, no?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Most people carry more than one and it's very easy to recharge.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
It's a much bigger issue than any potion, especially because it's a luxury only the plat rich can afford.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Consider for a moment that the much-hated heal potions are the only thing saving poorly-geared people from instant PvP deaths. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Suggestions of nerfing and removing potions need to be ignored. They are not a significant balance issue when viewed relatively.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Casters benefit from many of these potions as well. I happen to know a mage who lives and dies by snare clickies. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Also, any healing potion can be easily outDPSed at its requisite level.&#xD;
They prolong fights, they only tip the scales if you're gimp, in my&#xD;
opinion. If someone beats you because you're carrying a potion, you&#xD;
have a problem. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Also, if we're going to go after a healing item for removal on Zek,&#xD;
let's get rid of the Prayers of Life first. Full HP insta-heals for the&#xD;
plat-rich. Much larger issue than two-minute recharge, mid-quality heal&#xD;
elixirs.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
And seeing as casters have far less HP than melees, I will say that&#xD;
said heal potions have saved my caster toons' rear ends many times and&#xD;
allowed them enough time to break a snare or root and get to shadow&#xD;
stepping, nuking, DoTing, whatever was called for again.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;er, Prayers of Life isn't a full HP heal, it's a 5x750 heal, which is still barely above 3500 without a crit.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I dont really like Suggestion 1, while it would be fine for pet classes, it would just suck for those classes that dont have em (wizard, chanter, maybe druids too). Personally I just want to see them removed from the server period, although it seems like most modern raid content is built with players having them in mind. I really dont know which is worse.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Suggestion 2 just doesn't seem possible since as far as I know it's impossible to fizzle clickies (the gate effect has a hardcoded chance to fail, this is not the same as fizzling) and getting developers to impliment new (and unbroken) code for PvP is like trying to dance with an elephant.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As for your buffs getting pelled, that was probably Abashi's staff of Disempowerment, you're a necro so you can use it too since abashi was a necro =)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'd really like to gather some solutions to the heal pot dilema, keep the ideas coming, bound to find one sooner or later.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, about the only suggestion that I have right now is to put mana regen potions into the game that are as powerful as the heal pots.  Would make for some really, really, long fights that would prove nothing other than who could buy the most pots.  I got attacked by a ranger today.  Had him under 30% a couple of times using some tips that Skelkus gave me (thank you Skelkus), but at the end of the day, he potted me right out of mana.  That's the real downside of these pots.  If you're a melee and I'm a caster we can both hit them, but when I'm OOM you've still got a sword and a range weapon, and about the best I can do is cuss at you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, how come a melee doesn't run out of stamina as fast as I run out of mana?  He can whack away all day long, pretty much, unless he pops some discs that are big stamina hits.   Maybe that's the way to neutralize the effect of the pots.  Adjust it so that hitting me for 1000 with a sword takes as much stamina as me hitting you for 1000 with a spell takes mana.  Then after you and I have both heal potted each other to a standstill, we can just stand there and look at each other until we med up.  Could make for some all-day fights, but what the hell.  It would be an improvement over the current state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Anything that makes pvp take longer is a horrible idea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I would agree with the mana regen pots but at the same time, i think us casters need to take into consideration the advatanges we have over most melee classes. The fact that we can hit for amazing amounts of damage from a position that is out of range for a melee hit is an advantage. Not to mention, if you use ninja tactics like me its an adavantage to nuke/dot than&amp;nbsp;invis/SS and&amp;nbsp;come from another angle and nuke/dot again. I would say it is almost even ground for the classes, though the introduction of a mana regen pot would be quite lovely.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
