    <description>I was going to post something about druids and shaman and realized not only is it off-topic, it is completly stupid. You want to be a shaman, make a shaman. You want to be a druid, make a druid. I personally am discussing what happened to my class, not what didnt happen to yours.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;To Rashere (or whoever is working on the AAs): &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Can we get some kind of explanation of what is going on with Gift of Mana? I’m sure it’s no great surprise, but you’ve got a lot of very unhappy shaman at the moment (and probably other classes). I understand that the idea was to prevent the firing of GoM on procs and the like, but you’ve managed to completely gut the AA for shaman now that it won't fire on cannibalize. Canna was a spell with a very long recast, for heaven's sake. It was NOT a fast-casting spell. Frankly, things are bad enough with us having Rytan designing our spells, but you’ve managed to gut the only decent thing we got this expansion. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It’s pretty clear no one up at SoE plays a shaman, we’ve known that for a while. However, please take a look at GoM from our perspective. Let me give you a couple of numbers first— &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1) We’ve had 2 shaman with full abundant healing and gift of mana cast our direct heal 100 times in their guild hall. One had abundant healing fire 7 times and GoM none. The other had abundant healing fire once. Note, that’s 200 casts of a heal and not one GoM firing. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2) Shaman spell line-ups are substantially defensive in nature due to our spell lines. Consider, for most shaman, I can name probably 5 of their spells memmed at any one time: malos, canna, slow (turgurs for a great many), our HoT spell, our direct heal spell. A disproportionate percentage of them still mem either spirit of leopard or spirit of panther as well due to the ridiculous resist rates on our DoTs. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Forcing the AA into the heal or harm mentality completely screws our class. We have 20% more mana costs on 95% of our spells anyway since Rytan isn’t bright enough to understand the consequences thereof. Technically, only ONE of the 6 spells most shaman have memorized have a shot at firing GoM—and it’s currently not working on our direct healing. If they have FA or Champion memorized, that falls to one of 7 spells. Shaman have already been firmly relegated into a support class, and now you’ve managed to hose the one bright spot we had—being able to use cannibalize to trigger GoM for nasty spells like Champion to help offset Rytan’s miserable lack of balancing. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Things are not real bright for us this expansion anyway. So far this expansion, we’ve gotten 2 new slows (25% and 40%, both mitigatable, as compared to our normal 75% slows) and a true AE that is a cone instead of a PBAE. Actually, I should say it’s half of a cone (the left half) since as far as I know Rytan hasn’t bothered to fix that spell either. Two of our specialty AAs are advanced rabid bear, which, last I heard, had parsed at 2 dps greater than rabid bear (I have not personally confirmed that, but I can attest that it isn’t very good), and Gift of Mana. Now GoM doesn’t work on 7 of the 9 possible spells many shaman frequently have memorized. Thanks to Rytan’s mana costs and inability to understand relative resist checks, we just don’t DoT that much, and our nukes are small and horribly inefficient. We can’t afford to DoT that much! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now we’re being told that having GoM fire on cannibalize was an exploit, and we won’t even be able to get a refund for the AAs after you gutted it’s usefulness. What the heck is going on over there, and can you guys please stop screwing our class over?!? Is there any chance we can get an expansion where our class gets some kind of parity with other classes in terms of upgrade? Just once, out of the last 7 odd expansions, can we please see an expansion where the shaman get some kind of upgrade, or at least hold our own in comparison to other classes?!? Our dps is now lower than ever (no dps increase this expansion), our healing isn’t any better (no upgrade this expansion), our utility isn’t improving . . . &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We have now dropped substantially behind DoTting classes since necros have been getting DoT upgrades (assuming we could even land what we have thanks to Rytan), our healing is dropping considerably compared to druids thanks to Skin and their more powerful blast heals (and clerics outshine us so far it’s silly—though as healing specialists they should), and we can’t tank much of anything any more, giving lie to the battle priest image. Clerics have better melee abilities, for heaven’s sake, not to mention better mitigation due to armor class changes. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Could you guys please stop screwing us over? We’re already pretty much sucking hind teat on the hog. Either shoot the class or fix it, ffs. At the very least, is there some kind of &amp;lt;gasp&amp;gt; vision for the class? For god’s sake, don’t tell us we’re a slowing class. If you do, I want to see where all of the mobs in every expansion post PoP can mitigate damage from warriors, SKs, paladins, wizards, necros, rogues, rangers, beastlords, berserkers, etc. by 25%, 50%, 75% or just be flat out damage immune. Slow has been substantially nerfed for ages. If that is our primary ability, it’s really time to rethink the class. A lot. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Throw us a bone here! What’s going on?!? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Chutoi &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;P.S. For all the pundits on the boards around here, yes, this is a rant. It has a purpose though—we’d very much like to know what’s going on.&lt;BR&gt;_________________&lt;BR&gt;Chutoi Doglsobber &lt;BR&gt;70 Shaman of Sol Invictus &lt;BR&gt;The Tribunal&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ok Frodlin I see your point on the cannabalize spell being listed under the beneficial category. However going back to the description of the aa it specifies any spell that heals or harms,&amp;nbsp;and &amp;nbsp;debuffs under lucy are stated under the detrimental category. The word detrimental &amp;nbsp;is a synonym for harmful (which to me means debuffs should have always been included in gom). How are people supposed to know exactly what the devs wanted on this spell? I mean at the present time the aa still works&amp;nbsp;with the necro lich, which is also considered "beneficial". How do you justify it working with necro lich and not canny? I understand the reason for the change was to prevent gom procs from item procs and chain casting low or zero mana spells. Canny cannot be chain cast, only once every 18 seconds. No other class was near as affected as the shaman class with this change. Make it work with debuffs and hot's and I think the majority would be happy. If they are not going to adjust the aa and what can proc it they should allow for a refund since the aa has been altered and atm is significantly less useful to us now. As to the boohoo you guys are cursed with to much to do comment, why should we as a class be penalized because our primary role is not mainly damage or mainly healing? Sorry I know I am rambling but it is just disheartening to have something changed that affects&amp;nbsp;the class in such a negative way, have our community correspondent be told we where exploiting the whole time like a bunch of hackers, and then have to defend the reason we ask for a refund for the aa. Something should be done about it. Allow it to work with debuffs or hots or make canny cost 1 mana so it can once again proc gom. If neither of those are an option they should allow for a refund. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Actually Frodlin the description is somewhat&amp;nbsp; unclear, "any spell that heals or harms" . Technically cannabalize could be considered a harmful spell simply because it takes hit points away and after working for so long most just assumed it was intended to work with gom. The solution is simple imo, allow gom to work on debuffs and hots and there wont be a problem anymore. Can you honestly say it is fair to shaman who are primary debuffers/buffers to not be allowed gom procs on their most cast spells? Every other class gets gom procs from their primary role. Wizards and mages from their nukes, clerics and druids from their direct heals and nukes, and necros from their dots. The only other class I think gets kinda screwed are chanters, which if debuffs (I consider mezzes would be a debuff) were allowed to proc it I think would fix that issue for them, tho I admit I dont know what all it procs on for the chanters..I assume only nukes atm. As to those saying it should work on buffs, I honestly dont care if buffs proc it as long as heals over time and debuffs were allowed to. However I would like to point out it seems very ironic that during the panther prenerf discussions panther was widely argued to be shaman damage, whereas now it is not a damage spell to be allowed gom procs but a buff that does not proc gom. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Don't give me the 'heals or harms' nonsense and try to pretend it's not clear, that's so disingenuous that it's shameful that you'd try to invoke that.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Canni isn't a harmful spell because it produces a net benefit.. as a matter of fact, when you click your spell gems... you can easily tell what are heals or harmful spells, they're listed on the submenus in the spell selection.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Damage over time&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Direct damage&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Heals&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Canni is under "Utility Beneficial, conversions"&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It's considered beneficial... what you're doing is being a complete hack.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I mean, any spell which costs mana could be said to be 'harmful', because it uses a beneficial resource, but we all know that this is not what they're talking about.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Furthermore, eating yourself is not your "primary role".... that's just a side benefit for being a shaman.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; You don't go "Conniseur of Self LFG".&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I've never seen /ooc "gourmand of my person looking for group'.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You're suffering the "curse" of having too much to do... big deal, you malo, then slow.. then what.. you go afk?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Of course not, your next series of roles are heals, nukes, and dots.... all of which can trigger GoM just fine, except HoT's which I'd agree&amp;nbsp;is a legitimate issue.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Not being able to trigger GoM on cannibalize though is not a legitimate issue, and&amp;nbsp;the noise you're displaying on this and the various other threads about it&amp;nbsp;makes your class look like the biggest buffoons in EQ.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Seriously, you have no idea how stupid you guys look at this time, and your hostility toward Rytan is amazing.... just amazing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Does anyone who /feedbacked have a response from Sony going 'Yeah, it's ok that you trigger gift of mana on canni'?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Of course not... the answer you claim you didn't get came last patch... when it was disabled.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; That's the answer to those /feedbacks.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; How you can claim they're 'too quick' to fix beneficial bugs, then complain about the length of their inaction is ... well, like every single other aspect of your arguments.... without logic.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;The damage from cannibilise is applied to Geomantra, reducing the HP that geomantra can absorb, thus I assume it counts as incoming spell damage? (of course, it's bugged, in that Geomantra effect does not reduce the damage taken, but the damage applied reduces geomantra)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Cannibilise does do me damage.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;All spells are a net benefit to you (by reducing mob HP you gain XP).&amp;nbsp; Arguments based on benefit or harmful are I believe a deliberatew intent to muddy the waters,&amp;nbsp; The text of the AA ability says "Heals or harms" it does not specify self or other.&amp;nbsp; You are choosing to reinterpret that to support your arguement.&amp;nbsp; As a player, surely I should rely on the text presented to me in the game?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;The AA description states &lt;STRONG&gt;heals or harms. &lt;/STRONG&gt;It does &lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;not&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;, in any way shape or form make distinctions between "net gain", net balance, harmful but beneficial, heals or harms an enemy&amp;nbsp;or any other extraneous caveats. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Shaman harm themselves in order to gain mana, which in itself is also a heal (I believe wizards have their Harvest under a Heal category). This is a reduction in HP. The net consequence of a Cannibalise is the loss of HP. The mana gain is not equal to the HP loss. &amp;nbsp;Reduction in HP (net or otherwise) is a harming effect, period. Shaman &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;die&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; from Cannibalisation. Death from a spell is a harmful effect, period. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Cannibalise is Harmful, period, yet Shaman are able to mitigate the harmful effect by healing themselves. Mitigation of harmful effects are not factored in descriptions otherwise heals would not trigger GoM. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Making petty distinctions because you disagree with the interpretation of the plain English description of the AA is rather puerile, even for you.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The product has changed function without warning, indeed&amp;nbsp;every indication from Beta onward was that Cannibalise's relationship with GoM functioned as described on the tin.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Feedback given in Beta, would have alerted SOE to the fact that the Shaman community considered GoM as a functional entity with Cannibalise and therefore alerted said community to the fact that it was considered an unintended side effect... before the fact... WELL before.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Despite the natural variations in playstyles do not distract against the fact that now the AA does not function as advertised.&amp;nbsp;Since the AA no longer functions as&amp;nbsp;advertised and as precidence&amp;nbsp;a number of&amp;nbsp;any other changes in function, of AA's in the past, people are now entitled to a refund.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;</description>

      <description>The ability was tested and placed live with canni proc'ing it.  This was not unknown to players or to the devs.  Why they would put something in the game they knew "did not work as intended", never tell us and then nerf it after we worked hard to get it is beyond me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The argument over if it was overpowered is not an issue.  If you think it was overpowered or if it was well suited does not matter.  What does matter is an ability that many Shaman found very useful has now been rendered massively less effective.  Two simple answers:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Make Canni cost 1 mana or 5 mana whatever so it will be included in GoM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OR&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Refund the AA's&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally I will say again, please stop nerfing abilities that work too well until you fix the ones that do not work at all.  Please?</description>

According to the beta-testers they did submit it was proc'ing on canni and there was no information or indication that was wrong.  Until this patch, as far as we knew, it was supposed to proc and did proc on canni.  When reading the description of the AA, it fit right in there.  It did "harm".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now they have changed it.  It did proc on test, it did proc on live, it did proc when I bought it and I used it for months as did hundreds of other Shaman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The AA we bought has been altered, nerfed whatever you want to call it.  It should be refunded.  It is not what I worked to get anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you still don't get that, then you are beyond my assistance.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Canni wasnt' supposed to trigger GoM, so it's fixed... you're not supposed to get a free spell by gaining mana... that's just idiotic.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;You don't get it either.&amp;nbsp; The devs knew about Canni firing GoM.&amp;nbsp; It was /bugged and /feedbacked extensively both in beta and after release.&amp;nbsp; They didn't 'fix' it until after quite a few shamans bought GoM because they thought it was intended because if it wasn't, surely, the devs would fix it before release or shortly after it.&amp;nbsp; Not, say... several months after release.&amp;nbsp; It would be the equilavent of 'fixing' the range of your "Press the Attack" AA and not refunding you because it wasn't intended to be a pulling tool and since you were supposed to read their minds,&amp;nbsp;they're not going to refund it either.&amp;nbsp; However, they did refund it when they changed the AA.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Nowhere on the description of the AA does it say, did it say, has it ever said 'this will always fire from using cannibalize'.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The reason it was bugged and feedbacked by shamans, was precisely because they knew it was stupid to be able to get a mana free cast for gaining mana.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If you are seriously going to tell me that so many red flags went up in peoples' minds that they feedbacked and bugged&amp;nbsp;en masse, but that there's some kind of statute of limitations for removing spell side effects that are clearly not intended, then you're more in denial than i ever thought possible.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
The AA description states &lt;STRONG&gt;heals or harms. &lt;/STRONG&gt;It does &lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;not&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;, in any way shape or form make distinctions between "net gain", net balance, harmful but beneficial, heals or harms an enemy&amp;nbsp;or any other extraneous caveats. &#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The AA sure does now.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
Shaman harm themselves in order to gain mana, which in itself is also a heal (I believe wizards have their Harvest under a Heal category). This is a reduction in HP. The net consequence of a Cannibalise is the loss of HP. The mana gain is not equal to the HP loss. &amp;nbsp;Reduction in HP (net or otherwise) is a harming effect, period. Shaman &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;die&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; from Cannibalisation. Death from a spell is a harmful effect, period. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Cannibalise is Harmful, period,&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Your spell line up disagrees with you.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;yet Shaman are able to mitigate the harmful effect by healing themselves. Mitigation of harmful effects are not factored in descriptions otherwise heals would not trigger GoM. &#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You don't see, at all, what's bad about cannibalizing, getting free mana, and then, for one mana, getting the health back?&amp;nbsp; This doesn't ring &lt;EM&gt;any&lt;/EM&gt; warning bells with you?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
Making petty distinctions because you disagree with the interpretation of the plain English description of the AA is rather puerile, even for you.&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'd recommend right clicking an empty spell gem and observing what category cannibalize is under.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The product has changed function without warning,&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The product has not changed function without warning, it still functions just fine, you just don't get something for nothing now.&amp;nbsp; Don't be so up in arms about it, you even have the developer telling you the intent of the spell, and you still want to argue it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;indeed&amp;nbsp;every indication from Beta onward was that Cannibalise's relationship with GoM functioned as described on the tin.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Well, either your reading of the indicators, or the indicators themselves, were wrong.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
Despite the natural variations in playstyles do not distract against the fact that now the AA does not function as advertised.&amp;nbsp;Since the AA no longer functions as&amp;nbsp;advertised and as precidence&amp;nbsp;a number of&amp;nbsp;any other changes in function, of AA's in the past, people are now entitled to a refund.&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It never once implies that you must be able to use it with Cannibalize, no matter how you wish to change around vague statements.&amp;nbsp; That's like me saying "Gasp, I want a refund for precise strikes, because it says that I get a bonus to backstabs, but it only works on the special ability and not every pierce I make to the back!"&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Sounds pretty stupid doesn't it?&amp;nbsp; Guess how you sound.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
No where on the description of the AA does it say, did it say, has it ever said "This excludes spells, which have a mana regeneration component".&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The effect itself sure does.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;First, most rangers understood that the amount of double attack added to HoP/SoH was excessive.&amp;nbsp; But the changes to those buffs makes SoH as useless as it was before.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As to GoM, its offered to certain classes only.&amp;nbsp; Yet two classes (Shaman and Enchanters) have roles in which GoM is basically useless (and currently broken).&amp;nbsp; Shaman contribute indirectly to dps, not directly.&amp;nbsp; GoM needs to be changed to reflect this role.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you for your feedback about the changes to GoM.&amp;nbsp; As Rashere said the change was made for a reason and not to single any one class out.&amp;nbsp; I am closing this thread because it has been hashed out to the point now that people are resorting to name-calling, flaming and personal attacks.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The AA sure does now.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'll recheck this evening. Last time I checked it was as described.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Your spell line up disagrees with you.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ah, so cleric damageshield is actually BENEFICIAL now is it? Oh right! OK. I cast this on a mob and it hurts itself. It is somehow beneficial all of a sudden. This is both recourse and the blatantly casted damageshields. These are in practice&amp;nbsp;no way, shape or form considered beneficial spells. Most other spells that I have which are cast on the mob,&amp;nbsp;and which&amp;nbsp;hurt the mob in some way, are called Deteremental Spells.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I learnt long ago to disregard positioning and categorisation on the game menu because often they are blatantly wrong. So I /snort at the house of cards because not all spells are where they should, therefore, the location is not perfect and therefore your assertion that canni is a beneficial effect is not entirely true.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;IMO it should not be in Beneficial at all. It is a mana conversion effect, which has its own category.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
You don't see, at all, what's bad about cannibalizing, getting free mana, and then, for one mana, getting the health back?&amp;nbsp; This doesn't ring &lt;EM&gt;any&lt;/EM&gt; warning bells with you?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Nope. Because it is a &lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;chance&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; to trigger the proc in order to regain the mana. It is not guaranteed, and until such time it is gauranteed you are taking a risk with it. You take the risk of death, a definition of a&amp;nbsp;damaging effect.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Or on the flip side the wizard Harvest spell is, I believe, listed under their Categories as a HEAL. So Cannibalisation is one&amp;nbsp;or the other no matter how you might like to twist it. Both of them triggerable on the GoM.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
I'd recommend right clicking an empty spell gem and observing what category cannibalize is under.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If that is all you're holding onto to defend SOE and its crazy decision you'll need to find something more credible. Its location on the listing is one of the weakest defenses I have ever heard because of the many blatant inaccuraces dotted, no doubt, across all classes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
The product has not changed function without warning, it still functions just fine, you just don't get something for nothing now.&amp;nbsp; Don't be so up in arms about it, you even have the developer telling you the intent of the spell, and you still want to argue it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The product has changed function without warning. PERIOD. We were not warned of upcoming changes to the AA that would change its behaviour from the one that shipped out from day one.&amp;nbsp; There is simply no argument to this. And as for the developer the description of the spell until very recently did not give this impression either.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It is completely and utterly irrelevent since the AA has been fucntioning with cannibalisation since Day One and nothing and no one has stated otherwise. Assumption as working as intended.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Touch of the Divine works just fine. It did not function the way&amp;nbsp;it was&amp;nbsp;intended.&amp;nbsp;Its function was changed. People got a refund. I do not see the difference between Touch of the Divine and Gift of Mana in this instance.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So yeah, if it has changed its function AND description (Both without warning - as you say it has) those that bought it before the change of function AND description (as you said) are definately entitled to a refund.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
I'll recheck this evening. Last time I checked it was as described. &#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I didn't say the description, I said the AA.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
Ah, so cleric damageshield is actually BENEFICIAL now is it? Oh right! OK. I cast this on a mob and it hurts itself. It is somehow beneficial all of a sudden. This is both recourse and the blatantly casted damageshields. These are in practice&amp;nbsp;no way, shape or form considered beneficial spells. Most other spells that I have which are cast on the mob,&amp;nbsp;and which&amp;nbsp;hurt the mob in some way, are called Deteremental Spells. &#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But you don't cast it on the mob, you cast it on yourself.&amp;nbsp; When you cast it on yourself, you get the benefit of mobs hurting themselves.&amp;nbsp; The end result is irrelevent, the spells are lined up in terms of how it affects the person you're casting it on.&amp;nbsp; You cast the damage shield on yourself, therefore it benefits the person who it's casting on.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;That should have been simple enough for you to understand.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
I learnt long ago to disregard positioning and categorisation on the game menu because often they are blatantly wrong &#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Well no, you simply disagree with it, which is fine, but so far your only example was wrong.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
Nope. Because it is a &lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;chance&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; to trigger the proc in order to regain the mana. It is not guaranteed, and until such time it is gauranteed you are taking a risk with it. You take the risk of death, a definition of a&amp;nbsp;damaging effect. &#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The fact that there was a chance was the problem, and it's been rectified thank you.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
If that is all you're holding onto to defend SOE and its crazy decision you'll need to find something more credible. &#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Not at all, it's simply one of many facts that people like you choose to ignore in favor of a "slow strike" or some other civil rights movement.&amp;nbsp; Planning a 50,000 (million) shaman march on San Diego in protest next?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;No, the fact that it costs no mana to cast this spell, it &lt;STRONG&gt;gives&lt;/STRONG&gt; you mana, is why it's pretty easy to defend "SOE and its crazy decision".&amp;nbsp; I'm sorry, but as I understand it, no Troll, nor Ogre, nor Iksar, nor Barbarian flesh sirloined and devoured by its owner is in any way makes you go "Wow, now that I've eaten my left index finger I fell much more fit to cast this spell!!".&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
Assumption as working as intended. &#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I suggest you check your facts before you be antagonistic.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Case: &lt;A href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5269&amp;amp;source=Live" target=_blank&gt;Mark of the Blameless&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The damageshield is cast directly onto the mob. It damages the mob. It is detremental. Even Lucy has it listed as detremental (although that too, can also be miscategorised). The spell *is* detremental, yet it is listed as a beneficial spell. That is a miscategorisation, par excellence!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The point was to rely on positioning on the menu of your spell icon is a piss poor defense on whether something is damaging or healing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
