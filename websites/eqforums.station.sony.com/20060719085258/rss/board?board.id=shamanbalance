      <title>Evasive disc clicking off sense</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=shamanbalance&amp;message.id=6233#M6233</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Why is it that when&amp;nbsp;a warrior clicks there evasive discipline it clicks off sense?&amp;nbsp; There are plenty of things that don't stack, like might and champion however the buff icons are still there.&amp;nbsp; It just seems to me like this is a bug, so I thought I might mention it here.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Also why is it that shamman's buffs don't last long at all.&amp;nbsp; Even after aa's and such it seems that shamman well get Sc$$wed on the fact of constantly recasting buffs.&amp;nbsp; It just doesn't seem fair that ever other pure caster class gets like 4 times the buff time as shamman buffs.&amp;nbsp; Lol champion wont mgb.&amp;nbsp; maybe this is some design, but found it funny that a buff won't mass group buff.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If I'm in the wrong forum for posting these questions tell me what the right forum is, however it just seems to me that shamman's get the short end of the stick when buffing a raid.&amp;nbsp; Still wondering why they even get the spell might. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you have answers or fixes to these problems please post below.&amp;nbsp; Main things that I would like to see fixed is shamman duration of buffs and sense not clicking off warriors if they use there evasive disc.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;PS&amp;gt; I'm not a shamman but I live with one, and for the sake of my sanity please extend shamman buffs to last longer, really no clue why they don't atm...(yes all aa's and extended enhancment 35% item, and it still doesn't get close to last long enough)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;I was under the perception that a&amp;nbsp;Shaman has a very hard time being the main and only healer in a decent group until he or she gets a lot of AA'a.&amp;nbsp; Is this true?&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Reposted from Samanna.net:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Prathun is the new spell guy!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Vahlar is now as Assistant Lead Designer!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Oshran is now in charge of AAs!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. The devs actually seemed surprised that the target/cycle NPC functionality picked up our Spirit Idol (the whole crowd chimed in that it did and it needed fixing); the Dev panel said they'd take a look at it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. Aura refresh: they also said that they were looking into problems with recasting an aura when one was already in place, and they would like a recast to merely refresh the duration of the current one, rather than bouncing due to one already being there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6. Some NPC innates/AEs in newers zones seemed to be casting excessively often, and that would be looked at.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;7. Ability to gimp (85/15) in to ToB was being looked at.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;8. I asked why VP didn't ever ever interrupt casting mobs; Rashere said that NPCs didn't get location checks like PCs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;9. They actually found a problem with taunt, that it sort of scales down in effectiveness as the player and mob exceed level 60.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;10. They intend to display pet damage more succinctly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;11. Rashere said he would consider changing the reuse on 24-hour veteran awards to 22 or 23 hours, so that they could be used during daily sessions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After lunch, Prathun actually asked me what the Shaman community was looking for in our spells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let me say that again...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Spell Guy asked me what we wanted in our spells!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I informed him that, unlike other spell-based group HoTs, ours was not MGB-able; I made a little noise about the recast on GoR; and I again mentioned the Idol F8 thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gloriana was there, of course. I don't think I mentioned that yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I got to meet XeroOmega (aka Theodr), Greaux, and several previously unknown people who wanted to thank me for samanna.net... or who just liked my hat. I'm sure pictures of it will show up soon enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a fine supper with Kytherea, Jon from mmorpg.com and Autumnkiss from stratics.com, I loitered in the lobby with Prathun, Merloc, Qaman, Verdandi, Persephone (hi, Tikiko!) and... Reesie, was it? Sorry, I wasn't taking notes. Embarassed We eventually found our way up to the bar, where Tharkis found us. It seems I had forwarded each phone to the other one, and nobody could call me. Duh The crowd was making its way to either Tharkis' or Persephone's room for some Apples to Apples and drinks, but I decided to head home, as it was midnight and I didn't want to explain what I was doing drinking and playing games in some girl's room after midnight... or some skirt-wearing guy's room, either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As usual, though, Loral has a more organized update at &lt;a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?article=10462" target="_blank"&gt;http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?article=10462&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;ps, For the record, Verdandi wore her Polar Bear Hat the whole time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;pps, They announced plans for a new &amp;quot;not a classic server&amp;quot; server, which will have current zones, but any content from expansions would have to be unlocked before they became available. It would start out as if you only had the original expansion licensed, then they would license other expansions as content was conquered. No transfers. They didn't say, but I imagine the current UIs would work.&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Samanna on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;04-08-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;01:37 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I'm receiving a lot of complaints about the Idol showing up on F8 (mostly by tanks).  Is there a way that this can be made non-targetable, or perhaps put in a mechanism to have it avoid showing up on cycle/nearest target keys?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Class Issues List - Discussion | Feb 06 Revamp</title>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;Issue No. 1: Upgrade Shaman Malos Spell Line &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recast delay is unmanageable for the amount debuffed with this single-target spell. Like many core Shaman abilities, it was tuned for a level 65 endgame. Therefore, we propose a new unresistable resist debuff spell in the line, with the standard 2.25 second recast.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;Issue No. 2: Add Resist Modifiers to Shaman Damage Over Time Spells &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shaman DoTs are penalized with no resist modifiers due to our ability to debuff; yet other dotting classes can debuff just as well, if not better, suffer no such limitations. Our dots are our most effective and efficient way of dealing damage, and in modern game play we lose out heavily due to having to cast Malos to have them reliably land. By the time we cast a DoT, efficiency is lost because the MoB is already ~70% and our DoT will not see its full duration, or anything close to it. More detail is available at &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://samanna.net/sham.issues/debuffs.jan06.shtml"&gt;http://samanna.net/sham.issues/debuffs.jan06.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;Issue No. 3: Upgrade Shaman Cannibalization AA Line &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Cannibalization AA ability was astonishingly powerful when introduced with the Luclin expansion, and also quite dicey: it took a lot of typical shamans' health bars, and as a result there were situations in which it could be used only at significant risk. In return it provided huge amounts of mana relative to the casting demands of the day. Naturally, spell mana costs have only risen with subsequent expansions and level increases, as have the hp pools of the shaman using this ability. Cannibalization, scaled for the level 60 player and spellbook, has fallen behind; it presently is simply an average work tool, returning a modest amount of mana for a modest cost of hp.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;Issue No. 4: Correct Shaman Group Haste Buff &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We propose that the current spell Talisman of Alacrity be renamed to Talisman of the Wind, and adjusted to be balanced properly. This is not a new spell, but a rewriting of the current version which appears not to be balanced properly. Enchanter group haste spells (Speed of Shissar, Speed of the Brood) remain superior, with 68% haste and valuable melee modifiers. Shamans get to buff to 60% haste at level 63; there is no reason why the group version at the next level should be a downgrade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We propose the following corrections:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spell: Talisman of the Wind&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Group 60% haste (no other stat effects).&lt;br&gt;Duration 36 minutes.&lt;br&gt;Mana cost 750 (3 x Swift like the Wind's 250 mana).&lt;br&gt;Level 64 (one level after shaman single target Swift like the Wind; 17 levels after enchanter single target Swift like the Wind; 4 levels after enchanter group spell Speed of the Brood).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;Issue No. 5: Allow healing focus items and AAs to affect the amount healed per tick on Heal-over-Time spells &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Damage-over-Time spells cause a base amount of damage per tick; the actual amount of damage each tick is then calculated by adding in any bonuses for both (a) Burning Affliction and similar effects (X Anger/ Fury/ Rage/ Vengance/ Anguish/ Dragon), and (b) crits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By comparison, Blast Heal spells cause a base amount of healing; the actual amount of healing is then calculated by adding in bonusses for both (a) healing focus items and aa, and (b) crits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Heal-over-time spells (HoTs) are the central tool in the shaman healing model, making their power a big concern for the shaman community. A problem we've observed is that HoTs do not get the same progressive power increase as their direct-heal counterparts as characters advance, because they're not as well supported by Alternate Advancement and focus effects. Shaman who have worked hard to gain improved healing aa and items end up not improving this vital aspect of their class. Damage over time spells and direct damage spells don't have this same disparity, because they're boosted by the same foci.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To bring the power progression of HoTs in line with other spells, we'd like current direct healing focus effects to boost heal-over-time spells just like direct damage foci boost damage-over-time spells.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;Issue No. 6: Give us a consolidation Slow, with the benefits of both Balance and Turgur's spells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Short duration and long recast make the Balance spells (Nihil and Discord) not viable independantly; Shaman players either mem both or carry a TA in multi-mob settings because of recast times. Turgur's Insects lacks the resist modifiers needed to land it without a prior resist debuff. Please combine these into one usable, TA-retiring slow.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;Issue No. 7: Improve Shaman Survivability&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As replacement for the current Ancestral Guard AA, we propose the following two AA:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Defense of the Arcane Spirits&lt;/b&gt;: Level 62; 9 aa points. Insta-cast. Reduce the Damage Interval portion of incoming melee damage by 75%, for four ticks (18-24 seconds); duration not extendable by items or aa. Base refresh time: 10 minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quickened Arcane Defense&lt;/b&gt;: Three ranks, Level 66 / 68 / 70; cost 6 / 6 / 6 aa points. Each rank lowers the refresh time of Defense of the Arcane Spirits by 100 seconds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;The current Ancestral Guard AA is less effective because (1) its short duration means it pretty much has to be clicked at a very precise reactive moment to be effective; (2) as a rune it caps the damage mitigated, instead of (like a discipline) mitigating all damage received during its duration; (3) there is no provision for it to improve as the shaman moves up to harder encounters.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;Issue No. 8: Upgrade Shaman Group Movement Spell&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shamans are the first class to get SoW (level 9); yet first druids and then rangers get spells that equal and then surpass our ability to buff movement speed. Spirit of Bih'li is the last upgrade to movement buffs we have received: at level 36. Note that this spell would be a comparable alternative to Flight of Eagles in many situations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a potential solution, we propose the following new spell:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;New Spell &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;1: See Invisible(2)&lt;br&gt;2: Increase Movement by 65%&lt;br&gt;3: Water Breathing(2)&lt;br&gt;4: Ultravision&lt;br&gt;6: Increase ATK by 25&lt;br&gt;Duration: 1 hour(s)&lt;br&gt;Location: ANY&lt;br&gt;Target Type: Group v2&lt;br&gt;Any amount of mana, any level&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;Issue No. 9: Improve Shaman Healing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=64032"&gt;http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=64032&lt;/a&gt;, SOE Developers wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;...we are looking to increase your healing ability &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;so you can function better as main healer in groups&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As a potential solution, we propose the following new spell: Spell: Talisman of Trushar Group Heal over Time. Level 67 (two levels after shaman single target Breath of Trushar). Heals 630 per tick (more than Quiescence, but still well below Spiritual Serenity's 820 per tick) for 4 ticks; the amount healed per tick and buff duration can be increased by standard shaman aa abilities. Mana cost 1260 (3 x Trushar's 420 mana).&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;Issue No. 10: Allow our 75% Slows to Coexist on a Mob&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is just plain pointless and leaches fun from the game when one finally gets Turgur's to stick to a raid mob, only to have it overwritten by a Balance slow. Please allow them all to live peacefully with each other on the mob. Similar coding to how Vindictive Spirit can coexist with other slows.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discuss.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;to be Sony's year long April Fools target?  What's up with Sony and Shaman spell progression?  Everyone remember PoP?  They had to totally rewrite our spells because their progression sucked so much.  They had to merge two spells and give us a totally new one.  Now we get OoW 2, almost 3 expansions ago, and they did it again with Champion and Group Might.  Our last spell is inclusive in the 4th spell?  Whats up with that?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And why is that that 2 almost three epxansions later level 70 shaman mains STILL don't have all their non-ancient spells from that expansion?  Its time for SoE to start looking at Rune drops and really Upping them.  This is ridiculous.  At this point what I want most is a quest to allow you to turn in a 66, 67, and 68 rune to be fashioned into either a 69 or 70, or something.  Why does Sony always drop the ball on retuning expansions that have been out a while, especially ones that raise the level cap, to allow for the changing economy needs after we've attained the new cap?  Remember when Kunark came out?  How much was Singing Steel armor?  How much was Cobalt?  How many Bards on your server?  How many warriors?  This is the same stupid thing.  How many level 66-68 mains are on your server? How many 69-70?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I was wondering if anything worthwhile could (or should) bit done with Shaman melee power?&lt;br&gt;I understand our AC cap and basic mitigation is low in proportion to the amount of aggro we can develop by just doing our jobs..... what would be a fair AC cap?  We do get a spell for damage mitigation at the highest levels, but nothing for the leveling Shaman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would a self only line of damage mitigation buffs be of help?  Yes, another buff -- but since that is our main job anymore I thought it would fit.  Maybe 15th level Shroud of Ancestors giving a 4% mitigation, 30th level Shield of Ancestors at 7%, with a last one at 50 Barrier of Ancestors giving 10% -- all buyable spells.  At the cost of two buff slots a Shaman can have 17% mitigation after 66th level (with Sense), not counting AAs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for melee, I do NOT want dual wielding, I am a shield bearer and like it.  With Puma and up, we get (dare I say it?) nearly Beastlord DPS for short bursts, at the cost of constant spell refreshing.  For personal melee use, would double attack (lower cap as a skill or maybe a high inbuilt skill when in bear form?) make any difference to a shaman?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OK, I admit it... I had two coffees with breakfast, a double espresso on the way to work and am currently drinking a Bawls.  Still I think they are good random thoughts.</description>

      <title>Cannibolize option</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=shamanbalance&amp;message.id=6080#M6080</link>
      <description>With all the hoopla about GoM and Cannibolize and just Cannibolize in general, how about a complete change to the spell?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Give us the Hybrid Combat ability window and make Cannibolize a /disc.  It then falls outside the effects of other abilities, and Shaman regain a buff slot for that ever fun Canni-Dance.&lt;br&gt;This can be balanced against other classes and lost buff slots.  Harvest, the various Divine Auras, basically any instant cast "unique" spell can become a /disc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Opinions?</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I just have been looking for ever and ever and I still cannot find out an answer to my question.&amp;nbsp; We have been given nice recipies for some decent throwable potions, however we ourselves as a class cannot throw. Forever we could fletch,&amp;nbsp; but this seemed to be for naught unless some shaman just wanted to say Fletching ### as a tradeskill, however no matter what we made be it bows arrows darts or javelins we could not use them.&amp;nbsp; Now we make throwable potions, including a snare potion, something I have been personally wanting since forever, and well, still we cannot use them.&amp;nbsp; WHY???&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Would it really be something so terrable if a shaman could throw an item?&amp;nbsp; Would it make the other classes less than they are?&amp;nbsp; Would it break something beyond fixing? Would it cause a rift in the time space continuim that would threaton to wreak havock upon all mankind???&amp;nbsp; Please just someone answer this for me, preferably someone like a Dev or in the know with Sony or even just your thoughts on the subject.&amp;nbsp; Just something to know I am not so far off in left field as to never have a chance to see a kind face ever again.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Please, something?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I was reminded that people don't have to go to Samanna.net to provide feedback on the present top ten list.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The current list:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Kytherea wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="#0066ff"&gt;Completely re-worked list - 10/10/2005&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="+0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue No. 1: Upgrade Shaman Malos Spell Line &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000" size="2"&gt;(currently being evaluated) &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Recast delay is unmanageable for the amount debuffed with this single-target spell. Like many core Shaman abilities, it was tuned for a level 65 endgame.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Therefore, we propose a new unresistable resist debuff spell in the line, with the standard 2.25 second recast.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="+0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue No. 2: Upgrade Shaman Cannibalization AA Line &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;(currently being evaluated) &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;font color="#cccccc"&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;- Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;When introduced, Cannibalization was astonishingly powerful, and also quite dicey: it took a lot of the typical shaman's health bar, and as a result there were situations in which it could be used only at significant risk. In return it provided huge amounts of mana, relative to the spells of the day and the mobs of the day. Naturally, spell mana cost has only risen with subsequent expansions and level increases. This ability, once scaled for the level 60 player and spellbook, has fallen behind; it presently is simply an average work tool, returning a modest amount of mana for a modest cost of hp. As a potential solution, please consider the following possibilities:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Improved Cannibalization&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;: Three ranks, each taking a bigger bite. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Quickened Cannibalization&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;: Three ranks, each allowing shorter refresh.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="+0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue No. 3: Upgrade Shaman Group Movement Spell &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font color="#0066ff" size="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Shamans are the first class to get SoW (level 9); yet first druids and then rangers get spells that equal and then surpass our ability to buff movement speed. [Spirit of Scale (level 52/53) is pretty fast, but hasn't really been useful since PoK and its books/stones; back in the day that you had to run across ten zones to get somewhere, a movement buff that let you run but not do anything else was still worthwhile; but a no-fight no-cast ability no longer has utility.] That makes Spirit of Bih'li the last upgrade to movement buffs we have received: at level 36. Note that this spell would be a comparable alternative to Flight of Eagles in many situations. As a potential solution, we propose the following new spell:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Spell: Talisman of Bih'Li &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;1: See Invisible(2) 2: Increase Movement by 65% 3: Water Breathing(2) 4: Ultravision 6: Increase ATK by 25&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font size="2"&gt;Duration: 1 hour(s) Location: ANY Target Type: Group v2&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font size="2"&gt;Any amount of mana, any level&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="+0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue No. 4: Correct Shaman Group Haste Buff &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000" size="2"&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We propose that the current spell Talisman of Alacrity be renamed to Talisman of the Wind, and adjusted to be balanced properly. This is not a new spell, but a rewriting of the current version which appears not to be balanced properly. Enchanter group haste spells (Speed of Shissar, Speed of the Brood) remain superior, with 68% haste and valuable melee modifiers. Shamans get to buff to 60% haste at level 63; there is no reason why the group version at the next level should be a downgrade.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We propose the following corrections:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Spell: Talisman of the Wind&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; Group 60% haste (no other stat effects). Duration 36 minutes. Mana cost 750 (3 x Swift like the Wind's 250 mana). Level 64 (one level after shaman single target Swift like the Wind; 17 levels after enchanter single target Swift like the Wind; 4 levels after enchanter group spell Speed of the Brood).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="+0"&gt;Issue No. 5: Improve Shaman Healing &lt;font color="#0066ff"&gt;(NEW)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In &lt;/font&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=64032"&gt;&lt;font color="#fac400" size="2"&gt;http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=64032&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; SOE Developers wrote:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;...we are looking to increase your healing ability&lt;/font&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;so you can function better as main healer in groups.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;As a potential solution, we propose the following new spell:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Spell: Talisman of Trushar&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; Group Heal over Time. Level 67 (two levels after shaman single target Breath of Trushar). Heals 630 per tick (more than Quiescence, but still well below Spiritual Serenity's 820 per tick) for 4 ticks; the amount healed per tick and buff duration can be increased by standard shaman aa abilities. Mana cost 1260 (3 x Trushar's 420 mana).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="+0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue No. 6: Improve Shaman Survivability &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000" size="2"&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;As replacement for the current Ancestral Guard AA, we propose the following two AA:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Defense of the Arcane Spirits&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;: Level 62; 9 aa points. Insta-cast. Reduce the Damage Interval portion of incoming melee damage by 75%, for four ticks (18-24 seconds); duration not extendable by items or aa. Base refresh time: 10 minutes. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Quickened Arcane Defense&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;: Three ranks, Level 66 / 68 / 70; cost 6 / 6 / 6 aa points. Each rank lowers the refresh time of Defense of the Arcane Spirits by 100 seconds.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Background:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; Shaman healing is built around the concept: [debuff] / slow / heal. The healing of clerics and druids is built around the concept: heal. Shaman healing is the most difficult of the three priest classes, because it assumes not only that the shaman casts spells on the tank (which might draw aggro), but first must cast spells on the mob (which might draw aggro); moreover, slowing spells are resistable, so they may need to be cast more than once to stick (thus increasing the chance of drawing aggro). Doing all this also takes more time than it takes just to cast healing spells. Melees get a variety of mitigation tools with differing refresh times. Most relevantly, Beastlords get a similar function, Protective Spirit, with a refresh time of 3 min 54 seconds; and Clerics get several emergency functions with refresh times of 3 minutes. The proposed aa length, 4 ticks, is longer by one tick than the druid mitigation buff and some of the cleric effects. That's because the shaman is designed to fill the main healer role through a process that takes time: [debuff] / slow / heal. To address this, the shaman's emergency ability should be at least one tick longer (enough for Turgur's or Nihil, followed by gem refresh). A detailed analysis of this proposal, with comparisons and examples, can be found here. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;The current Ancestral Guard AA is less effective because (1) its short duration means it pretty much has to be clicked at a very precise reactive moment to be effective; (2) as a rune it caps the damage mitigated, instead of (like a discipline) mitigating all damage received during its duration; (3) there is no provision for it to improve as the shaman moves up to harder encounters.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="+0"&gt;Issue No. 7: Upgrade Shaman Virulent Paralysis AA Line &lt;font color="#0066ff"&gt;(NEW)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;In order to maintain this ability's usefulness, we propose two changes.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Improve the resist mod on Virulent Paralysis&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; In the LDoN era VP3 allowed shamans to do decent improvised crowd control: to knockback one add out of camp while the group dealt with the remaining mob(s). Today's mobs routinely resist and break VP; it needs a better resist mod so that it will land reliably, and generally stick for full duration. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Add a supplementary AA, Hastened Virulence&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;: Three ranks, Level 66 / 68 / 70; cost 6 / 6 / 6 aa points. Each rank lowers the refresh time of Virulent Paralysis by 22 seconds.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; VP3 has a 20 tic duration. This would allow us, at maximum level, to Root-CC two mobs, with VP refreshing at 9 tics.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="+0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue No. 8: Improve Shaman DPS &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000" size="2"&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;We propose three ways that this could be done:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;a. Increase the proc a little on the panther / leopard line of buffs &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;When implemented, Spirit of Panther was a 550 hp proc, cast on anyone, superproc on pets. This 'first guess' was later judged to be too powerful, and it was severely reduced to the current 400 hp proc, cast within group only, mildly better on pets. We would suggest that this 'second guess' has erred a little too far on the low side, and that panther proc should be increased somewhat, with lower level spells scaled accordingly (the pet proc rate and the in-group restrictions remaining as they presently are). &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;b. Implement upper level poison focus items &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;There is a noticeable lack of poison focus items at higher levels. Other classes can get the best focus percentages, but there are currently no shaman poison items that correspond to foci obtainable by other classes. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;c. Increase the resist modifiers for shaman damage-over-time spells&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Other dot classes have large modifiers built into their spells. Sometimes the mobs a group is fighting have their resistances debuffed, and sometimes they don't: but in either case it is common for the shaman spells to bounce while the spells of other classes hit.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="+0"&gt;Issue No. 9: Upgrade Shaman Combat Effects Modifier Spells &lt;font color="#0066ff"&gt;(NEW)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Shaman currently have two spell lines that do not stack in effects (both icons take hold on players, but only one has any benefit), Champion and Spirit/Talisman of Might. In the case of Champion/Talisman, these are both spells we obtain at level 70. In a normal environment, Champion would be cast on our group the entire time, leaving no use for Might. In a raid/group environment, Druids have the exact same effect on their "Lion's Strength" spell as well, leaving minimal use for the spell on a raid. We propose three ways that this could be done:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;a. Give Might a "non-melee damage" component to give the spell a use for caster classes.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; This could be in the form of a stacking focus akin to the bards Rizlona line, or an increase in spell crit chance, or something new and unique. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;b. Allow Champion and Might to stack in effects.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;c. Change the effect on Might to add a bonus to "Combat Effects", Strikethrough, Accuracy,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; or something that would be beneficial to our group members.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="+0"&gt;Issue No. 10: Upgrade Shaman Bear Form Spell Line &lt;font color="#0066ff"&gt;(NEW)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Form of the Bear and Form of the Great Bear were popular and useful buffs for shaman leveling up, but we saw them fade from usefulness with no upgrade. The Wisdom boost from Bear is archaic in today's gameplay, as is the token amount of regen. As a potential solution, we propose the following new spell:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Spell: Form of the Oracle &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;1: Illusion: Bear 2: Increase Hitpoints by 25 per tick 3: Increase WIS by 25 4: Increase max HP by 500 5: Increase Wis Cap by 25 6: Increase HP when cast by 500&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font size="2"&gt;Duration: 30 minutes or more. Location: ANY Target Type: SELF&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font size="2"&gt;Any level, any mana cost.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;This spell would &lt;/font&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;not&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt; stack with the Brell/Strength/SV line. The increase in wisdom would be a welcome and unique addition to the class, while keeping in kind with the spirit of the original spell line. The HP regen boost was a staple of the original spell line, and has been modernized for the faster content. The HP boost would help balance it with other class self buffs, while losing the stacking of the paladin line to prevent a large HP gap versus other classes.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Note: Community requests that this Bear Form Spell be permitted to stack with the Greater Rabid Bear AA, with one illusion taking precedence.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Kytherea on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;10-17-2005&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;02:19 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discuss.</description>

      <title>New spirit pet idea</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=shamanbalance&amp;message.id=6057#M6057</link>
      <description>I know im prolly gonna get whacked for sayin this cause I know alot of shamans covet their spirit wolves, but we've had beastlords who get a pet unique to their races. These are wild animals that reside in their region or have a lore for these kinda pets. I think it would be cool if Shamans, dealing with the spirit world, would get spirit versions of these same pets for their race. Before you completely naysay they could be completely new spirit pets side by side the old spirit wolves or could be an AA or other possibilities that don't replace the precious wolves.</description>

      <title>What is a shaman?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=shamanbalance&amp;message.id=6050#M6050</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;During my 6 years of playing a shaman in Norrath I am asked on a regular basis "What is a shaman's role?" by people who are new to the shaman class or who are just curious. So I figured I would write this post to try to help explain our class and our role.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now to start off the shaman fits many roles. We are what most would consider a 'support' class which means in a nut shell we don't make the group we just make the group better. Originally the direction SOE had for the shaman was to be the ultimate melee class buffer, which arguably is the truth. There isn't an hour that goes by that I am in PoK that I don't get sent a few tells asking for my buffs, which are some of the best in game hands down. Our buffs can bring up your STR, AGI, DEX, STA, AC, HP, CHR, they can speed up your attacks and bring up your resists. In short this is just some of our buffing abilities. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Another of our fine abilities is healing. Our heals aren't up to speed with the clerics or even with druids but we can heal and we are usually used as back up healers in a group with either a cleric or a druid as main healer. As healing goes we have a line that does heal over time which is great to cast on a tank as the pull is incoming to off set the damage he will take while you are trying to get the mob slowed. Along with our healing spells is our healing AAs which we have a couple of. Ancestrial Aid is a good group heal which can be used in an emergency and is instant cast which can mean the difference between pulling it off or wiping and summoning the corpses.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But buffing and healing is only a small portion of what makes a shaman a desired class so lets look at the offensive capabilities of our class. We have what SOE considers to be the most powerful spell line in the game hands down and that is our Turgurs line or our Slow. When in a combat situation a shaman can slow all his enemies attack speed by 75%, considering that is what the spell was designed to land at. SOE has for years now felt that this spell is too powerful and added ways to limit the ability of our slow spells, from making mobs immune to changes in speed, to upping their MR so it has basically no chance of landing, to having mobs mitigate the slows to almost nothing.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now lets not forget about the shaman DoTs. Our DoT spells are some of the best out there second only to the necro. We have mainly poison and disease but we do have a few magic based curses which are basically short term but they do deal decent amount of damage in the 5 to 6 tics it is on the mob for. With the low actual combat DPS we put out, these DoTs bring up our DPS quite a bit.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We also have a pet to help with DPS out put. Now our pets in no way can stand up to most pets like say with a mage pet or a necro pet but they do add a bit more DPS and when solowing these pets will help out quite a bit.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Shaman can also play the part of crowed control. We have numerous root spells and with our chain armor we can take a few hits before we go down so it is natural to use the shaman on crowd control. We also have an AA called Virulent Paralysis that will root a mob and our PoP armor also has a right click root effect on it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So in short our class can play many roles in a group and just remember a Shaman doesn't make the group we just make the group stronger.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>The Shaman Community has come up with a new Top Ten list. Presently lacking a Class Correspondant, this list is available online now, so that it can be submitted in time for the next update window.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;a href="http://samanna.net/sham.ten/index.shtml" target=_blank&gt;Shaman Class Top Ten - September 23, 2005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This list is prioritized and fine-tuned based on extensive polling at &lt;a href="http://samanna.net" target=_blank&gt;The Spirit Realm&lt;/a&gt; Shaman Class Forums.</description>
