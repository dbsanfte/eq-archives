Not only that, but the people that would make it / want it made could not even hunt in VP even if they somehow managed to luck out and get flagged for it.<br><br>The only way to currently get those pieces currently are if you have a bot that is flagged and can go there and tank the mobs easily, or know someone that is keyed for the zone and actually wants to go there. Finding people with the keys is one thing, finding someone that actually wants to go there is a whole other problem.
