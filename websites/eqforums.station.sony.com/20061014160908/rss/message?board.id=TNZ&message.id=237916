      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I'm coming back after a few year hiatus.  I'll be re-rolling from scratch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've found the various creation guides on Caster's Realm, but they are quite old.  Is this info still valid?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've read the &amp;quot;Returning ...&amp;quot;  faq, but didn't see anything addressing this (may have missed it).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There are so many different options now to raise your various stats that you can easily find a way to overcome any weakness you may have.  You can even add in AA's at level 51+ that raise your stats innately.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I recomend putting most of your stats into stamina.  It never hurts to have as many hitpoints as you can.  It's not a big deal, but caster gear tends to steer more towards wis/int than stamina, so get what you can when you can.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Oh, and welcome back.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I've been back on EQ now just 2yrs.  Since i've come back the biggest difference i've seen is the guild lobby; of course i'm a 62cleric so I thought that was huge. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Varus&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I still check out the creation guides from Caster's Realm from time to time.&amp;nbsp; Part of what I really like about them is comparing the various races.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Stats are much easier to obtain nowadays, maxing out wis and int is so easy that I generally don't put more than a few points when I create a new caster.&amp;nbsp; I do, however, stick a few in str and sta so that they can carry a bit more loot.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So basically, other than giving you a bit of a jump start up to 30-35, I wouldn't overly obsess over where to put points.&amp;nbsp; You'll be fine, even if you go deliberately out of the way to give yourself the worst start ever.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I would, however, give some thought to deity selection.&amp;nbsp; It used to be that there were basically no positives to having a deity.&amp;nbsp; Then we started having deity specific cultural armors (which are mostly outgrown now and we have agnostic armors as well) and it seems to me that we have more deity restricted items than we used to.&amp;nbsp; Cultural tradeskills can also be impacted, although even half-elves have finally developed some culture of their own.&amp;nbsp; Fletching, for example, is a much easier and cheaper skill above 260 if you are a Tunarean Wood Elf simply because of their cultural recipes.&amp;nbsp; Warning though, this could change at any moment with or without warning.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basics are still teh same, yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Main differences to a person returning from days of old...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will start in Gloomingdeep, a tutorial zone (you can opt out of this, but I wouldn't). Follow the tutorial to get pretty well caught up. We now have charm slots, and the reward from your first 'Hail Person X' quest results in a really nice charm for that slot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tutorial will let you get to level 10, and give you really basic gear to work with. When you leave the tutorial, you will be sent to the Plan of Knowledge (PoP zone that has become the default gathering spot, in case its been a whole lot of years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quest you recieve when you zone in will send you to an NPC in the Library. Hail her a few times and you can get 4 or 5 other quests that all take place there in PoK, and gets you familiarized with the zone. There are three NPCs in PoK that will give you newbie armor quests at each level after 10. This is in addition to the newbie armor quests available in your home city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your home city: Aside from possibly a few spell purchases, or cultural tradeskilling\tribute\etc, you never actually HAVE to go there. You do still start out with your Guild Note, and can head there and give it to your city's Guild master, but you don't have to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froglocks are the newest race, and Bezerkers are the newest class. I'm not sure how up to date your guides are, so just in case: Trolls are back in Grobb, and the froggies have an encampment out in the swamp somewhere. If you choose one of those races, be careful you don't head to the wrong home city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the newer gear, initial stats mean less and less. By the time you hit 50 or so, you should easily be able to cap out your primary stats, and get real close on the rest. Agility seems to be the hardest for me to cap, personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, there are TONS of changes, but the tutorial will help you out on the ones that are game mechanics. The rest you really will just have to figure out as you come across them. You will be auo joined to a New Players channel, so help is mostly a /1 HELP! away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stromm supposedly has the most low level\new players, but I am not sure if that is by much of a margin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you end up on 7th Hammer, look for any Klan ov da Grok members on line....they are all mostly me these days. I'll see if I can't get ya situated and answered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It is much easier to get gear with decent stats now, so race and stat assignment is even less a factor unless you are anti-bazaar.  There have been some change in classes, beastlords and berserkers added and some abilities nerfed, enhanced or farmed out.  Melee now have have disciplines that are powered by endurance as spells are by mana, so the melee/caster line is blurred.  The first 25 levels are faster now than the first 10 were for my November 2003 paladin so really just try what you think you will like.  It is very hard to hurt yourself at creation now.   </description>
