<P><BR>If I remember correctly, Calambra is either on the upper level of the boat (with the PoK portal and the ZL to Stonebrunt), or she is behind one of the buildings near the Drog pen.</P>
<P>If you have your compass activated, there should be a line that you can use to find her. Are you seeing the line on your compass?</P>
<P>by the way - if she is the one on the boat - the instant you step on the boat from the 'bridge', take a right toward the southern section of the boat - turn around to the north and you should see 1-2 ramps up to the NPCs.</P>

				<div></div>Petitioned and GM said to post here on boards if his simple solution didnt work, So here goes, Arena event, started it way back when it came out. Got to about level 24 and charm looking good.  Came back recently with same group and beat a few more waves and Charm no longer updates.  Tried destroying charm in hopes to even restart, but the guy in mission always gives back charm with same stats.  Even tried to put someone new in mission and started at about level 20 and went to 28ish and the different guy's charm is now better then the other 5 people.  Have tried restarting from level 1 all they way to 28 and charm still does not upgrade.  I hope I'm posting in the correct area, any help would be appreciated because it is a nice item once maxed.  Thank you in advance...
