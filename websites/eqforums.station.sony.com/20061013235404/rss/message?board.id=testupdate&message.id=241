    <description>Hi folks,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are some code changes that have made it to Test recently that I think people might be interested in. They haven't all passed QA yet but if people want to go test things out before the next live update this is probably a good time to try them out:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-----------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Auto Consent Group, Raid and Guild are now toggle buttons available in the Options window. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* The way EverQuest deals with INI files has been improved. Players on slower computers will notice this this most. Momentary framerate hitches that you may have noticed when opening bags or doing other things that caused INI files to be written out should be much improved. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Loading optimizations have been made. We've seen some systems load the game as much as 12 seconds faster, but this will vary per system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Players no longer have to find a guild master to begin using new skills made available by reaching a new level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Spell hate for spells with a fixed amount of hate now include hate-focus effects. Previously, spells with fixed amount of hate assigned to them would disregard hate focus effects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Leadership and raid assist ranges now have the same distance rules as the /assist command.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Accounts that do not have PoP or later expansions, but are eligible for veteran rewards, are now able to access them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* A rendering problem with luclin models on older GeForce cards (1/2/4MX) has been corrected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Persistent general channels have been added that currently have General, Class and Current Region set up. There is an button in the options window to control whether or not you wish to auto join these channels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Fixed an old issue with AA timers not being initialized properly. Previously, any new activatable AA ability that has a reuse timer would have an uninitialized value which would sometimes prevent players from using it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheers!</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ok this may be a little off the subject but&amp;nbsp; sure would be nice to have a banker beside the summon hall.&amp;nbsp; You bind in&amp;nbsp; the guild lobby so you can summon your body.. but&amp;nbsp; WELL no money? ok so now beg for someone to let you borrow some or run to guild hall or outside to the bank. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We need an ATM machine.. lol&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; something to allow us to buy the summon regent when we are naked and needing our bodies.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>The opening bag lag is much improved.  When I was hitting the command to open all bags, it was freeqing EQ up for up to 5 seconds.  Now they open almost instantaneously.  Zoning times are also much improved.  I had gotten into the habit of having Freecell up all the time and playing it while zoneing.  Now I don't have time to make more than 3 or 4 moves during most zone times.</description>

The fixes they made on Test were optimizations to the system in general that go beyond the triggering of AV. That is easy to prove, since we turn off antivirus while running EQ to see if that solves a particular lag we are getting. There are times when AV is clearly an issue, and other times not at all. The opening of the bags issue was a problem when AV was running, and when it wasn't. Also, the fix they put in works when AV is running, and when it is not.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Good changes, exept for the "no need to run back to your Guildmaster to learn a new skill" one. Little features like that are typical for EQ and I think a large part of it's succes.&amp;nbsp; Having to visit your Guildmaster again to open up that new skill because you leveled, does the following:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;It's much more of a milestone; hey, you learned a new skill, go back and tell your old GM about it!&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;It puts a brake on your xp-grinding and makes you get into&amp;nbsp;sync with&amp;nbsp;those other wonderfull RPG elements, like travelling, dialogue with NPC's, Lore and the slow but long path from Rags to Riches. &lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;It re-acquaints players with their roots, their starting cities: xp-grinding in non-racial&amp;nbsp;high-xp zones takes away too much of the game already.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;I always anticipate on a new skill that requires of me&amp;nbsp; to go back to my City: anticipation is a VERY, VERY good thing in a mmorpg. &lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Small hurdles make the reward sweeter.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Features like these are best left alone in EQ, because they set the game apart from the fast-food **** that we get nowadays. I have to ask: have many people complained about having to go back to their GM for learning the skill? I can hardly believe that but if so, then these people should be slapped with a large trout.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Or was it just the "let's smooth out everything" virus, that seems to rage in mmorpg-land, where anything that is slightly illogical, or does not make sense&amp;nbsp; or is slightly imbalancing or a wee bit redundant or somewhat obsolete or maybe even a bit too expensive, is cut out of the design document?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"Generalitis" will be the downfall of Mmorpgs, I tell you.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I agree with Bulge, visiting GMs to get your skills as you advance is something i'd like to see left in the game.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

My zoning time currently is horrible, and the freeze ups when opening bags, tracking window, casting a spell, ect is a pain. When I read this I decided to try the test server. Both issues were fixed for me on the test server. I was zoning like I used to and I was able to open things without freezing up. I had almost forgotten what it's like to open a bag without everything freezing up on you lol.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;* Spell hate for spells with a fixed amount of hate now include hate-focus effects. Previously, spells with fixed amount of hate assigned to them would disregard hate focus effects.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So does this mean that my SoS (Furious Bash VII) Will actually work with my Terror of Discord spells, Furious Bash IS supposed to increase spell/bash hate, yet you never see an emote saying **Your SoS glows blah blah** When casting ToD spells, but do see an emote **Your SoS glows brightly red** When bashing mobs with it&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;New chat features only work if there are people on who are in them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'd like to see you revamp the Looking For Group.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;One thing I'd like to see is the ability (like in Call of Hero), to search for people in a specific zone in order to form a group, then, using an interface, click on those people and send them an invite to group, coupled with a simple list of the kinds of groups a person might like that the person who wants a group can click, something like toggles 1) Looking for Any, 2) Looking for Ldon, 3) Looking for Shared Task, 4)&amp;nbsp; Not Looking For a Group.&amp;nbsp; That, at present, seems to be all you really need.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Right now, people do a Who all Cleric, for instance, and just send out blind invites via tells.&amp;nbsp; A tool to make this more specific might work better.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To tell the truth, if you just recreated the CoH model, I'd not kick, their way of finding groups rocks, and is one of the main reasons I am pulled in that direction for my gaming pleasure.&amp;nbsp; That and the costume creation, which, though it has some irritating limitations, also rocks.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;The remedy on test now works and I upgraded my Nvidia drivers to 71.87 and it was able to render! W00T! Also, the options menu has changed names my card and allows me to turn on "HW vertext shading". I guess that is hardware vertex shading instead of the "pixel" shading on some newer cards.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I love the new options menu-it will not allow me to make choices my card does not support, making it "idiot proof" for folks like me. And also, I can experiment while Im online instead of having to leave the game and make a post on tech forums about how to optimize the graphics. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Spell hate for spells with a fixed amount of hate now include hate-focus effects. Previously, spells with fixed amount of hate assigned to them would disregard hate focus effects.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does this include Concussion and Ancient: Greater Concussion?  These have negative aggro.  With Spell Casting Subtlety and my epic 2.0 I should have 26% less aggro.  That would make reduce my concussion's effectiveness considerably (-300 * .74% = -222 aggro).</description>

      <description>What about fixing collision issues? Cannot cornertank in several GoD zones, even shrunk 3x, this results in crippling the rogue class entirely as they cannot backstab, and the whole raid will recieve ripostes from mobs that are cornered (along with the tank being stuck/pushed into a wall).</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Every mob that can be fought in a corner can also be fought outside a corner. Pretty certain the dev's are aware of this issue, that keeps coming back. Just gotta adapt.</description>

      <description>The channels is nice although on general I think thats going to overload and be exceedingly spammy and confusing .  The era channel, such as kunark, planes etc is a nicer idea, those in a similar area to yourself are around, and the class one is nice. One thing you might want to add is a trade channel, to try and reduce the general chat from spammage as I can imagine on a live server with 1000+ people in there chattering, LFG and selling thats gonna be very tiresome and almost impossible to keep up with.</description>
