&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Content Raiding Server&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;« 06-01-2006 05:05 AM »&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The "Progression" server is a step in the right direction, but can not maintain a healthy competitive environment for raiders.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Here is a general plan for a fun, challanging, feasible, raiding server that just might have a longer lifespan:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Starting character begins in the "Original EQ" era. This means no Iksars, Vah Shir, Berzerkers, or Beastlords. All revamped zones are reverted back to original states, or as close as possible. Items that no longer drop such as Manastone and Rubicite Breastplate are back! Journeymans boots are dropping in Najena once again.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With some new changes: now when you reach the doors to enter the fire giant area in solb or the ice giants in vox's lair you will find an npc or object that raids can use to trigger a "raid instance". Inside the instance the min level is 46 and max level is 52 and you will find the giants and other monsters in and around Vox or Nagafen.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When your defeat the encounter for the first time your character recieves the message "the heat/chill from Nagafen's/Vox's passing permeates your soul, you feel the barriers to Fear, Hate, and Sky weaken", (or something to that effect). When you have killed either one you are locked out of that instance for 5 days. When you have killed both dragons you are now capable of entering Fear, Hate, and Sky planes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The planes of Fear, Hate, and Sky are all instanced zones. The npc to generate the Fear instance is located near the fear portal, entering Fear is still done by using the portal, but only after your raid has selected the instance. Fear has 2 types of instances, the first one has level req of 46 max level of 55 and provides a flag when you kill cazic thule. The second Fear instance has no max level but provides no flags, purely for loot and for epic parts later on. Killing a golem in fear adds a parallel zone lockout timer of 3 days. So killing 2 golems would place 2 lockout timers on your instance window that would both end in 3 days (very similar to the lockouts in the current Plane of Time zones). Killing Cazic Thule in the first instance adds a parallel 7 day lockout timer and gives you a message "You have overcome your Fears, yet you still feel a deep Hatred toward all living things", (or something to that effect). The lockout timers from either type of instance will prevent you from entering both.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The plane of Hate has 3 instances, the npcs to trigger them stand on each of the wizard spires around "Original EQ" zones except for the one in the Temple of Cazic Thule. The first one has a min level of 46 max level of 55. Killing "Named Minis" give you a 3 day lockout timer. Killing Innorouk gives you a 7 day lockout timer and the message "You have overcome deep seated Hatreds, and conquered your Fears of the unknown, you have gained access to the Ruins of Kunark", (or something to that effect). The second instance has min level req of 46 and no max level but provides no flags, purely for loot and epic hunts. The 3rd instance of Hate is actually the revamped "HateB" and will not be available until your character has accessed the Planes of Power.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The plane of Sky has one instance, min level if 46 and no level cap. It is purely for loot, quests, and epics.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now, this is where it gets interesting...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When your character has killed Cazic Thule and Innorouk you recieve an "Account Flag". This flag has mulitple effects. The most basic change is your ability to zone to all the unlocked kunark zones and trigger kunark raid instances. You still require keys to enter zones such as Sebilis, Howling Stones, and Veeshans Peak. You also can create new Iksar characters, and your level cap rises to 60th. You can also wear items you find in Kunark. As you begin hunting in Kunark you will notice every item that does not drop in "Original EQ" is stamped with the "Content Era" that it dropped in. (all items found on corpses in Kunark will clearly say "Kunark" under the stats). **IMPORTANT: Items stamped with Kunark can only be worn by players who have obtained "Account Flags" from killing Vox/Nag/CT/Inny**&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This all raises many questions, and the first answer is that... when the first raider completes all 4 flags (Vox, Nag, CT, Inny) he not only gains entrance to Kunark, but the ability to wear all kunark items with ANY character on his account of any level, he also gives "Serverwide" zone access to everyone else with some exceptions.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Unflagged people (missing one of vox/nag/ct/inny flags) gain the following:&lt;BR&gt;1. Ability to enter basic zones of kunark.&lt;BR&gt;2. Ability to join flag raids to kill Trakanon, Venril Sathir, Sev/Gore/Tal.&lt;BR&gt;3. Group, gain experience to 50th level, loot items they win, and hang with their guildmates.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Unflagged (missing one of vox/nag/ct/inny flags) people do NOT:&lt;BR&gt;1. Get to make Iksars.&lt;BR&gt;2. Get to level past 50th.&lt;BR&gt;3. Get to wear items specifically from Kunark and beyond (until flagged).&lt;BR&gt;4. Get to trigger raid instances.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In Karnors vs prep room is an npc that allows you to trigger the Venril Sathir instances. The first instance is min 46 max level 60th. Killing him gives your account part of the account flag to reach Velious. The second instance is min 46 no max level and is purely for loot and quests.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In Dreadlands, Emerald Jungle, and Skyfire Mountains are npcs to trigger raid instances containing Gore, Sev, and Tal respectively. You must kill at least ONE of these 3 dragons to earn your account flag to velious. 2 versions of each, first one is min 46 max 60, second is min 46 no max level and the second one gives no flags.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In sebilis, down near the juggs doorway is a trigger to enter the trakanon instance. First instance is min 46 max 60th level and can drop ton pos staff. Second instance is min 61 with no max level and both instances drop the normal loots bps or robe, quest items, teeth for Veeshans Peak keys.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When your character has complete the entire Veeshans Peak key, has killed Venril Sathir, and at least one of the 3 Sev/Tal/Gore, AND has vox/nag/ct/inny flags, you get an account flag allowing you to enter Velious zones.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When you have velious flag you gain the ability to enter Velious zones and trigger raid instances. And to wear Velious era-stamped items.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ok, everyone else on the server **that HAS been fully flagged for Kunark** now automatically gains:&lt;BR&gt;1. The ability to enter Velious zones.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;People flagged for Kunark (have Vox/Nag/CT/Inny flags) but not Velious do NOT gain the ability to:&lt;BR&gt;1. Trigger raid instances.&lt;BR&gt;2. Wear items stamped with Velious era (items that only drop in Velious or later expansions).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The players who do NOT have full Kunark flags (do not have Vox/Nag/CT/Inny flags) CANNOT enter Velious OR wear Velious items OR join raid instances.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Instanced content in velious:&lt;BR&gt;1. Yelinak&lt;BR&gt;2. Tormax&lt;BR&gt;3. Dain&lt;BR&gt;4. Velketor&lt;BR&gt;5. Statue and Avatar of War&lt;BR&gt;6. all of Temple of Veeshan&lt;BR&gt;7. all of Sleepers Tomb (Sleeper asleep, level 46-60)&lt;BR&gt;8. all of Sleepers Tomb (Sleeper awake, level 61+)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Flags required to earn luclin account flag:&lt;BR&gt;1. kill Arrynar (sp, 7 day lockout)&lt;BR&gt;2. kill one of (Yelinak, Tormax, Dain, or Velketor -7 day lockouts)&lt;BR&gt;3. obtain Sleepers key&lt;BR&gt;4. kill Phara Dar (vp, 7 day lockout)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Same rules as before, new expansion. Fully flagged to Luclin you can:&lt;BR&gt;1. enter Luclin zones&lt;BR&gt;2. create Vah Shir&lt;BR&gt;3. create Beastlords&lt;BR&gt;4. trigger Luclin raid instances.&lt;BR&gt;5. wear Luclin items with any character.&lt;BR&gt;6. gain alternate advancement points.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After the expansion has been entered, anyone fully flagged to velious can:&lt;BR&gt;1. enter Luclin zones.&lt;BR&gt;2. CANNOT wear Luclin items&lt;BR&gt;3. CANNOT gain alternate advancement points.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Instanced raids in Luclin:&lt;BR&gt;1. Vex Thall. (Aten Ha Ra 7 day lockout, all other named 3 day)&lt;BR&gt;2. Ssra temple. (Emp 7 day lockout, all other named 3 day)&lt;BR&gt;3. Seru (trigger in arx, 7 day lockout)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Flags required to enter the Planes of Power:&lt;BR&gt;1. Complete Epic 1.0&lt;BR&gt;2. kill Avatar of War (kael, 4 day lockout)&lt;BR&gt;3. kill Dozecar the Cursed (tov, 7 day lockout)&lt;BR&gt;4. kill Vulak Aerr (ntov-clear, 7 day lockout)&lt;BR&gt;5. obtain Vex Thall key&lt;BR&gt;6. obtain Arx key (seru) **must be obtained by at LEAST one person in your guild, or personally advance to step in earring quest just before arx key if you are unguilded**&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Once the first player gets flagged to Planes of Power it unlocks POK and the Bazaar to all players. Level cap moves up to 65th in planes of power, and new aa skills become available.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Planes of Power flagging, backflagging left intact with some additions:&lt;BR&gt;1. elemental planes flag gives "account flag" to access both ldon and loy content. (first person completing this also opens up ldon and loy content for EVERYONE else, and everyone else can automatically use LDoN and LoY era stamped items.)&lt;BR&gt;2. time flag is part of progression to Gates of Discord.&lt;BR&gt;3. every PoP flag raid is now instanced.&lt;BR&gt;4. all "raid encounters" such as gods no longer appear in the persistant zones.&lt;BR&gt;5. all single groupable and soloable "flag steps" continue to appear in persistant zones.&lt;BR&gt;6. you MUST be finish all Luclin tasks and be fully PoP enabled until you can finish ANY backflagging quests, this includes all the shortcuts including the tier 3 Time key that drops from named.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Flags required to enter Gates of Discord:&lt;BR&gt;1. Time flag (full or gimped - t3 keyed)&lt;BR&gt;2. kill Aten Ha Ra (Vex Thall)&lt;BR&gt;3. kill Lord Inquisitor Seru (Sanctus Seru - arx)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Flags required to enter Omens of War, Dragons of Norrath, Depths of Darkhollow, and Prophecy of Ro:&lt;BR&gt;1. kill Quarm (Time)&lt;BR&gt;2. obtain Qvic flag&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;All of those expansions become available, and level cap rises to 70th once you finish with Barxt/Ikkinz4 and Quarm! This is because of the varied content all players can enjoy in those zones, not just hardcore.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But, to open the new, as of yet unnamed, expansion after Prophecy of ro you must:&lt;BR&gt;1. Complete epic 2.0&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some notes and additions:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Paludal Caverns removed from the game on general principle, im kidding... ( or am i ? )&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After Planes of Power has been first entered, revamped zones such as Mistmoore, Cazic Thule, Plane of Mischief, Paw, Hole would exist in 2 persistant zones each. With the original version left as it is (except for PoM), and click to enter zonelines placed near the entrances of the old zones:&lt;BR&gt;1. MM (druid rings near zoneline)&lt;BR&gt;2. CT (pillars near ramp to ct)&lt;BR&gt;3. Hole (pool near warrens)&lt;BR&gt;4. PoM (revamped entrance is in Great Divide, old ToV zoneline is changed to new PoM)&lt;BR&gt;5. Paw (spires near paw)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Reminder, all items that do not drop in an expansion you have access to or in Original EQ are not wearable until you reach that flag.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Reminder, you can enter any zone one expansion beyond your account flags. But you cannot trigger raid instances or gain level caps or aa's, skills associated with that expansion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When you create new characters, they all have same access to content as your main or retired character. Meaning you CAN twink your alts and pick up flagging where you left off. Character based zone/raid flags/keys are still required to enter those zones.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Once the first guild breaks into Planes of Power, all the items that "no longer drop" disappear to fall in line with normal servers. Such as Rubicite Bp, Manastone, J-boots(quest only now), Circlet of Shadow, Rod of Annihilations, you get the picture. Paw, MM, Hole, and CT remain as dual persistant zones. But old PoM zoneline in NToV becomes just another zoneline to new PoM. The Sleeper is NOT automatically woken, but if all 4 warders are killed together again...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;NO character transfers to or from this server.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Once the first player finishes Luclin and becomes officially PoP flagged, this action unlocks the plane of knowledge and the bazaar for all players. The guild hall becomes available at the appropriate expansion in the same manner, for all players.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;On alts:&lt;BR&gt;1. You can create ONE special alternate character of any class or race you have currently unlocked, This character can be any level from 1 up to your mains level minus 10 levels (so a 60th main could have a free 50th alt). This means you CAN assist your lower content guildmates and friends with their flag quests or simply to exp and group for fun.&lt;BR&gt;2. This alt, as all of your characters, automatically gains the ability to wear any gear your main can as far as "era stamping" is concerned. This is because your "era" is an account flag not character flag.&lt;BR&gt;3. If your special alt becomes the same level as your main through grouping and exping, you have the option of designating it as your main character. Your previous character automatically becomes your "special alt"&lt;BR&gt;4. This allows a lot of freedom in exploring the classes of norrath, and if you chose to make a change its not going to cost you months to do it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;On Persistant Subguilds/Channels:&lt;BR&gt;1. everyone that is part of an overlapping era with you is automatically a member of one of your subguilds.&lt;BR&gt;2. everyone in Original and Kunark era, everyone in Kunark and Velious era, everyone in Velious and Luclin era, everyone in Luclin and PoP era, everyone in in PoP and Gates era, and everyone in Gates and beyond era, each of these pairs is a combined subguild. (when i say everyone in Original and Kunark era, im referring to players who cannot yet trigger instances in Kunark but can zone there because the first guild has given them access to the zones, not level caps ect)&lt;BR&gt;3. "Mentor Chat" is the channel where everyones lowest-era is = to your highest. These are the players who are most likely capable of assisting you in your hardest flags.&lt;BR&gt;4. "Peer Chat" is the channel where everyone has the same finished flag set as you. This is likely the best spot to find exp groups.&lt;BR&gt;5. "Disciple chat" is the channel where everyone's highest-era is = to your lowest, and is the best place to find players you are most capable of assisting with flags.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subguilds and pickup raids, bonuses for unguilded-guilded players:&lt;BR&gt;1. a raid composed of entirely UNGUILDED players that defeats a flag encounter such as nagafen or vox, AUTOMATICALLY generates 3X the normal drops. Whatever it drops it automatically drops 3 of whatever was randomly generated. For example, if you kill Nagafen and a Cloak of flame, a Treasure Hunters Satchel, and 2 Red Dragon Scales would have dropped: you instead will find THREE cof, THREE wt red bags, and SIX red scales.&lt;BR&gt;2. the 3X loot rule only applies to pre Luclin flag raids, and only instances where flags where 12 or more flags were won.&lt;BR&gt;3. GUILDED players automatically gain an increase of 10% coin every month earned from defeating monsters in groups of 3-6 players, up to a maximum of 50%! bonus plat/gold/silver/copper, and ONLY from autosplit coin.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Limited PVP, added ability for anyone to become PVP flagged on a limited scale as follows:&lt;BR&gt;1. You click one of these options: "Coward", "Soldier", or "Insane"&lt;BR&gt;2. in "Coward" mode you can attack and be attacked by anyone who is "Insane" and whose highest-era equals your lowest-era.&lt;BR&gt;3. in "Soldier" mode you can attack and be attacked by any in "Soldier" mode who match your era flags.&lt;BR&gt;4. in "Insane" mode you can attack and be attacked by anyone in "Coward" move, whose lowest-era is equal to your highest-era.&lt;BR&gt;5. activating any pvp mode prevents you from getting any beneficial spells, heals, ect, and you CANNOT change modes again for a min of 5 mins.&lt;BR&gt;6. deactivating pvp mode makes it impossible to change modes for a min of 5 mins, you cannot deactivate unless you havent been the target of an attack for the last 60 seconds.&lt;BR&gt;7. ***if you are in insane mode and soloing you get 30% more exp per kill solo***&lt;BR&gt;8. **if you are in Soldier mode you gain 10% more exp per kill solo**&lt;BR&gt;9. *if you are in Coward mode you gain 5% more exp per kill solo*&lt;BR&gt;10. if you die in PVP mode to a single players aggression a zonewide message appears humiliating you.&lt;BR&gt;11. if you die in PVP mode to multiple players' aggression a zonewide message humiliates your attackers AND prevents them from turning PVP mode off for 20 mins. (this 20 min timer resets if they get attacked in any PVP form)&lt;BR&gt;12. soloing a mob while in any PVP mode prevents you from leaving PVP mode for 5 min timer.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Constructive criticism:&lt;BR&gt;Caudyr &amp;lt; Invictvs &amp;gt; Bertox For initial motivation and assistance with vision of the perfect raiding server.&lt;BR&gt;Warfust &amp;lt; Invictvs &amp;gt; Bertox For unwittingly spuring my imagination to deal with his complaints and general rudeness in creative ways.&lt;BR&gt;Baccas &amp;lt; Enlightenment &amp;gt; Bertox&lt;BR&gt;Marmax for his whining about carebear camps, my primary motivation to introduce quick and painful pvp.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;!--   BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_editedby   --&gt;&lt;FONT face=verdana,arial,helvetica size=1&gt;&lt;I&gt;Last edited by smakpopy on 06-01-2006 at 05:19 PM&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

And to wear Velious era-stamped items.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ok, everyone else on the server **that HAS been fully flagged for Kunark** now automatically gains:&lt;BR&gt;1.

Wear items stamped with Velious era (items that only drop in Velious or later expansions).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The players who do NOT have full Kunark flags (do not have Vox/Nag/CT/Inny flags) CANNOT enter Velious OR wear Velious items OR join raid instances.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Instanced content in velious:&lt;BR&gt;1.

Fully flagged to Luclin you can:&lt;BR&gt;1. enter Luclin zones&lt;BR&gt;2. create Vah Shir&lt;BR&gt;3. create Beastlords&lt;BR&gt;4. trigger Luclin raid instances.&lt;BR&gt;5. wear Luclin items with any character.&lt;BR&gt;6. gain alternate advancement points.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After the expansion has been entered, anyone fully flagged to velious can:&lt;BR&gt;1. enter Luclin zones.&lt;BR&gt;2. CANNOT wear Luclin items&lt;BR&gt;3. CANNOT gain alternate advancement points.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Instanced raids in Luclin:&lt;BR&gt;1. Vex Thall. (Aten Ha Ra 7 day lockout, all other named 3 day)&lt;BR&gt;2. Ssra temple. (Emp 7 day lockout, all other named 3 day)&lt;BR&gt;3. Seru (trigger in arx, 7 day lockout)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Flags required to enter the Planes of Power:&lt;BR&gt;1. Complete Epic 1.0&lt;BR&gt;2. kill Avatar of War (kael, 4 day lockout)&lt;BR&gt;3. kill Dozecar the Cursed (tov, 7 day lockout)&lt;BR&gt;4. kill Vulak Aerr (ntov-clear, 7 day lockout)&lt;BR&gt;5. obtain Vex Thall key&lt;BR&gt;6. obtain Arx key (seru) **must be obtained by at LEAST one person in your guild, or personally advance to step in earring quest just before arx key if you are unguilded**&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Once the first player gets flagged to Planes of Power it unlocks POK and the Bazaar to all players. Level cap moves up to 65th in planes of power, and new aa skills become available.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Planes of Power flagging, backflagging left intact with some additions:&lt;BR&gt;1. elemental planes flag gives "account flag" to access both ldon and loy content. (first person completing this also opens up ldon and loy content for EVERYONE else, and everyone else can automatically use LDoN and LoY era stamped items.)&lt;BR&gt;2. time flag is part of progression to Gates of Discord.&lt;BR&gt;3. every PoP flag raid is now instanced.&lt;BR&gt;4. all "raid encounters" such as gods no longer appear in the persistant zones.&lt;BR&gt;5. all single groupable and soloable "flag steps" continue to appear in persistant zones.&lt;BR&gt;6. you MUST be finish all Luclin tasks and be fully PoP enabled until you can finish ANY backflagging quests, this includes all the shortcuts including the tier 3 Time key that drops from named.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Flags required to enter Gates of Discord:&lt;BR&gt;1. Time flag (full or gimped - t3 keyed)&lt;BR&gt;2. kill Aten Ha Ra (Vex Thall)&lt;BR&gt;3. kill Lord Inquisitor Seru (Sanctus Seru - arx)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Flags required to enter Omens of War, Dragons of Norrath, Depths of Darkhollow, and Prophecy of Ro:&lt;BR&gt;1. kill Quarm (Time)&lt;BR&gt;2. obtain Qvic flag&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;All of those expansions become available, and level cap rises to 70th once you finish with Barxt/Ikkinz4 and Quarm! This is because of the varied content all players can enjoy in those zones, not just hardcore.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But, to open the new, as of yet unnamed, expansion after Prophecy of ro you must:&lt;BR&gt;1. Complete epic 2.0&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some notes and additions:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Paludal Caverns removed from the game on general principle, im kidding... ( or am i ? )&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After Planes of Power has been first entered, revamped zones such as Mistmoore, Cazic Thule, Plane of Mischief, Paw, Hole would exist in 2 persistant zones each. With the original version left as it is (except for PoM), and click to enter zonelines placed near the entrances of the old zones:&lt;BR&gt;1. MM (druid rings near zoneline)&lt;BR&gt;2. CT (pillars near ramp to ct)&lt;BR&gt;3. Hole (pool near warrens)&lt;BR&gt;4. PoM (revamped entrance is in Great Divide, old ToV zoneline is changed to new PoM)&lt;BR&gt;5. Paw (spires near paw)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Reminder, all items that do not drop in an expansion you have access to or in Original EQ are not wearable until you reach that flag.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Reminder, you can enter any zone one expansion beyond your account flags. But you cannot trigger raid instances or gain level caps or aa's, skills associated with that expansion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When you create new characters, they all have same access to content as your main or retired character. Meaning you CAN twink your alts and pick up flagging where you left off. Character based zone/raid flags/keys are still required to enter those zones.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Once the first guild breaks into Planes of Power, all the items that "no longer drop" disappear to fall in line with normal servers. Such as Rubicite Bp, Manastone, J-boots(quest only now), Circlet of Shadow, Rod of Annihilations, you get the picture. Paw, MM, Hole, and CT remain as dual persistant zones. But old PoM zoneline in NToV becomes just another zoneline to new PoM. The Sleeper is NOT automatically woken, but if all 4 warders are killed together again...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;NO character transfers to or from this server.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Once the first player finishes Luclin and becomes officially PoP flagged, this action unlocks the plane of knowledge and the bazaar for all players. The guild hall becomes available at the appropriate expansion in the same manner, for all players.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;On alts:&lt;BR&gt;1. You can create ONE special alternate character of any class or race you have currently unlocked, This character can be any level from 1 up to your mains level minus 10 levels (so a 60th main could have a free 50th alt). This means you CAN assist your lower content guildmates and friends with their flag quests or simply to exp and group for fun.&lt;BR&gt;2. This alt, as all of your characters, automatically gains the ability to wear any gear your main can as far as "era stamping" is concerned. This is because your "era" is an account flag not character flag.&lt;BR&gt;3. If your special alt becomes the same level as your main through grouping and exping, you have the option of designating it as your main character. Your previous character automatically becomes your "special alt"&lt;BR&gt;4. This allows a lot of freedom in exploring the classes of norrath, and if you chose to make a change its not going to cost you months to do it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;On Persistant Subguilds/Channels:&lt;BR&gt;1. everyone that is part of an overlapping era with you is automatically a member of one of your subguilds.&lt;BR&gt;2. everyone in Original and Kunark era, everyone in Kunark and Velious era, everyone in Velious and Luclin era, everyone in Luclin and PoP era, everyone in in PoP and Gates era, and everyone in Gates and beyond era, each of these pairs is a combined subguild. (when i say everyone in Original and Kunark era, im referring to players who cannot yet trigger instances in Kunark but can zone there because the first guild has given them access to the zones, not level caps ect)&lt;BR&gt;3. "Mentor Chat" is the channel where everyones lowest-era is = to your highest. These are the players who are most likely capable of assisting you in your hardest flags.&lt;BR&gt;4. "Peer Chat" is the channel where everyone has the same finished flag set as you. This is likely the best spot to find exp groups.&lt;BR&gt;5. "Disciple chat" is the channel where everyone's highest-era is = to your lowest, and is the best place to find players you are most capable of assisting with flags.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subguilds and pickup raids, bonuses for unguilded-guilded players:&lt;BR&gt;1. a raid composed of entirely UNGUILDED players that defeats a flag encounter such as nagafen or vox, AUTOMATICALLY generates 3X the normal drops. Whatever it drops it automatically drops 3 of whatever was randomly generated. For example, if you kill Nagafen and a Cloak of flame, a Treasure Hunters Satchel, and 2 Red Dragon Scales would have dropped: you instead will find THREE cof, THREE wt red bags, and SIX red scales.&lt;BR&gt;2. the 3X loot rule only applies to pre Luclin flag raids, and only instances where flags where 12 or more flags were won.&lt;BR&gt;3. GUILDED players automatically gain an increase of 10% coin every month earned from defeating monsters in groups of 3-6 players, up to a maximum of 50%! bonus plat/gold/silver/copper, and ONLY from autosplit coin.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Limited PVP, added ability for anyone to become PVP flagged on a limited scale as follows:&lt;BR&gt;1. You click one of these options: "Coward", "Soldier", or "Insane"&lt;BR&gt;2. in "Coward" mode you can attack and be attacked by anyone who is "Insane" and whose highest-era equals your lowest-era.&lt;BR&gt;3. in "Soldier" mode you can attack and be attacked by any in "Soldier" mode who match your era flags.&lt;BR&gt;4. in "Insane" mode you can attack and be attacked by anyone in "Coward" move, whose lowest-era is equal to your highest-era.&lt;BR&gt;5. activating any pvp mode prevents you from getting any beneficial spells, heals, ect, and you CANNOT change modes again for a min of 5 mins.&lt;BR&gt;6. deactivating pvp mode makes it impossible to change modes for a min of 5 mins, you cannot deactivate unless you havent been the target of an attack for the last 60 seconds.&lt;BR&gt;7. ***if you are in insane mode and soloing you get 30% more exp per kill solo***&lt;BR&gt;8. **if you are in Soldier mode you gain 10% more exp per kill solo**&lt;BR&gt;9. *if you are in Coward mode you gain 5% more exp per kill solo*&lt;BR&gt;10. if you die in PVP mode to a single players aggression a zonewide message appears humiliating you.&lt;BR&gt;11. if you die in PVP mode to multiple players' aggression a zonewide message humiliates your attackers AND prevents them from turning PVP mode off for 20 mins. (this 20 min timer resets if they get attacked in any PVP form)&lt;BR&gt;12. soloing a mob while in any PVP mode prevents you from leaving PVP mode for 5 min timer.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Constructive criticism:&lt;BR&gt;Caudyr &amp;lt; Invictvs &amp;gt; Bertox For initial motivation and assistance with vision of the perfect raiding server.&lt;BR&gt;Warfust &amp;lt; Invictvs &amp;gt; Bertox For unwittingly spuring my imagination to deal with his complaints and general rudeness in creative ways.&lt;BR&gt;Baccas &amp;lt; Enlightenment &amp;gt; Bertox&lt;BR&gt;Marmax for his whining about carebear camps, my primary motivation to introduce quick and painful pvp.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;!--   BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_editedby   --&gt;&lt;FONT face=verdana,arial,helvetica size=1&gt;&lt;I&gt;Last edited by smakpopy on 06-01-2006 at 05:19 PM&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I agree that you can't really enjoy old content on a regular server, but you can on a progression server.&amp;nbsp; Part of the old content was that it wasn't instanced.&amp;nbsp; Instancing it would completely change that content, and for the worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Im not so sure it&amp;nbsp;i so bad as&amp;nbsp;are people making it out to be.&amp;nbsp; Initially,&amp;nbsp;complete instancing of raids&amp;nbsp;would speed up the overall server progress too fast.&amp;nbsp; So im willing to toss out that idea.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But i think a hybrid between instancing along with the despawning of any boss&amp;nbsp;as it is killed with&amp;nbsp;serverwide lockouts&amp;nbsp;would not be so bad.&amp;nbsp; And after say, PoP gets unlocked, all of those serverwide lockouts and despawns are turned off so low.&amp;nbsp; That would mean low end guilds would not get trapped in the vicious cycle of "no targets to kill so lets disband and recruit to pop guilds".&amp;nbsp; That very thing is a primary reason pop flagging was so painful for everyone, all of these untested players leaping past content without skills or gear to handle it.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Ammelen hit the nail on the head in regards to instancing.&amp;nbsp; And as for etiquitte, I never had much trouble as far as raid go until I went to tallon zek, but that was to be expected.&amp;nbsp; It was a PVP server, the level of competition was raised a few notches and if you couldn't watching your entire raid die to another guild after you got a mob to 5%, then you wouldn't make it.&amp;nbsp; Then again, it was 100x more rewarding when we DID kill that mob.&amp;nbsp; Or when we DID kill the other guild AND our mob at the same time.&amp;nbsp; What a rush!&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by HH-Silver on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-04-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;04:33 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;But it is broke.&amp;nbsp; Its impossible to start a fresh guild of low levels and expect to progress normally from one expansions raid content to another.&amp;nbsp; Aside from the fact that almost every one of those rare spawns is slaughtered as it pops for fun, profit, or to twink alts by high levels, alot of the content has been removed.&amp;nbsp; Hate is gone, Inny isnt doable with 46-50s anymore hes like ep level or something now.&amp;nbsp; Veeshans Peaks is gone, so are some of the old exp zones like ct paw ect.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The only way a fresh guild could experience the game from begining to end is to instance all of the old content on servers that have passed the Luclin stage.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>At that point, you've effectively removed the point of instancing. =p&amp;nbsp; The idea behind instancing is that every guild gets access to a mob regardless of whether other guilds have killed it recently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;"At that point, you've effectively removed the point of instancing. =p&amp;nbsp; The idea behind instancing is that every guild gets access to a mob regardless of whether other guilds have killed it recently."&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It would still provide a cleaner score of who is better at not just killing the boss but also clearing to it.&amp;nbsp; In a standard zone a guild can sit back and follow the other guild in then gank the boss, or kill it after the first guild fails.&amp;nbsp; It also would reduce lag for the fight, instead of having 2-3 guilds hovering over the mob, you would have 2 or 3 seperate instances each running smoothly.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Also, after the first era or two&amp;nbsp;of content has been "conquered", they could revert the instances back to my original plan where lockouts are only generated on a raid by raid basis, instead of serverwide.&amp;nbsp; This would allow guild lagging behind more opportunities to catch up or at least stay within 2 expansions of the top guild.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you get what i mean,&amp;nbsp; Im sort of jumping around with these ideas since i may be about to alter one aspect of my plan.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Another option would be to implement the serverwide lockout changes on instanced targets, but also let the target spawn as normal in the persistant zone.&amp;nbsp; We will use Tormax as an example: Killing Tormax in the regular zone despawns any Tormaxi that are still breathing in any open instances,as well as a serverwide message and a lockout added to everyones expedition windows.&amp;nbsp; And the same holds true in any open instances of kael.&amp;nbsp; Killing Tormax in an instance despawns him from any instances AND in the persistant normal zone, along with the message and lockout serverwide.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;That would give players more ways to "race" to the kill.&amp;nbsp; And if you are clever maybe even give you an edge in how you approach the kill in kael or in the instances.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>BTW, when I played during Kunark/Velious/Luclin, training, ks'ing and the like were pretty rare.&amp;nbsp; You had competition with 2 guilds trying to pull a mob first, but first aggro was generally respected.&amp;nbsp; You also had a lot of cases of one guild waiting for the previous one to wipe, then killing it over their corpses.&amp;nbsp; Training wasn't a big problem though, people just didn't really play that way on Vazaelle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I started playing EQ in 2000.&amp;nbsp; Back then, you had to race for mobs.&amp;nbsp; Because you had to race for mobs, it made it that much more exciting.&amp;nbsp; I remember competing with a rival guild for Klandicar for an ST key.&amp;nbsp; Neither of us had a full raid force there, and ppl were still straggling in, but we had to pull or they would, so we did.&amp;nbsp; We wiped.&amp;nbsp; Then they pulled after we wiped, and wiped too.&amp;nbsp; So we pulled again, and wiped again.&amp;nbsp; Then they pulled again, and killed it.&amp;nbsp; They ended up getting the ST key.&amp;nbsp; This kind of a competition is much more fun for me than if we both just showed up, said hi, zoned into our instances, and zerged Klandicar until he was dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When there is no risk of losing the mob to another guild, there is not nearly as much satisfaction when you actually kill it.&amp;nbsp; When you're fighting a mob with another guild breathing down your neck, and you manage to kill it, that's a rush.&amp;nbsp; You can say FU to the other guild and enjoy passing out your loot.&amp;nbsp; There is an intense rush of adrenaline when you're fighting, because you know if you lose, the other guild will kill the mob.&amp;nbsp; That leads to a much greater sense of accomplishment when you actually kill it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, it places a greater emphasis on playing skillfully.&amp;nbsp; If you can show up at a mob and just attempt it 10x, 20x, 100x until it dies, then your guild might suck, but you'll still kill the mob eventually with dumb luck.&amp;nbsp; You might **SMURF** up a bunch of times, but it doesn't matter if you do, you just try again.&amp;nbsp; When there are other guilds and there is competition, you **SMURF** up, and you lose the mob.&amp;nbsp; It's a much better test of skill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, instancing is a step away from mmorpg.&amp;nbsp; The point of mmorg's is that there is a persistent world that all characters can interact with and change.&amp;nbsp; Instancing is just a step back from that, making the world less multiplayer, segregating people into small groups.&amp;nbsp; If you extend instancing as far as you can, you end up with people playing alone on their own computers.&amp;nbsp; Instancing is a step backwards in mmorpg's, not forwards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;I remember the rush to kill targets in velious very well.&amp;nbsp; I started shortly after kunark and was the first Iksar sk to 60th on Bertox.&amp;nbsp; MANY times my guild and another guild would begin forming and buffing for a kill at the same time.&amp;nbsp; Usually we just had to be a little patient as the rest of our forces got ported to the zone.&amp;nbsp; The first side to pull would do it out of nervousness and wipe since the healers werent full mana or tanks werent fully buffed.&amp;nbsp; Many times we would pick up a King Tormax as he was wandering back to spawn after the op force wiped at WL zoneline.&amp;nbsp; And you are right, most people did respect the initial aggro rules.&amp;nbsp; Some jerks would take it to extreme and run the target in circles till their groups arrived...&amp;nbsp; Sorta bends the rules too far.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In any&amp;nbsp;case, here is one possible solution to the lack of competition for specific spawns:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;[Once a raid kills a flag mob in their instance, it immediately adds a lock out timer equal to the spawn time of the mob on that particular instance for ALL players on the server.&amp;nbsp; So when a guild kills Nagafen in their raid it would send out a serverwide message "&amp;lt; guildx &amp;gt; has slain Nagafen!" And everyones expedition window now has a lockout timer showing exactly when that instance can be started again.]&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;You could take it further by having any existing Nagafens in open instances despawn immediately.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If this was added in along with the rest of my suggestions the very real possibility of losing your kill to another guild would still&amp;nbsp;exist.&amp;nbsp; And it would lighten the load on instance servers to an extent.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I guess this would be the Elite server.&amp;nbsp; This is not what EQ is to&#xD;

more power to you.&amp;nbsp; It might be good to get all those types of&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Exactly, a "raiding preferred" server.&amp;nbsp; Same idea as a roleplay or player vs player server, give the raiders a server where cheating and twinking isnt a viable tactic.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Your dont like raiding alot, its ok.&amp;nbsp; Some people dont like raiding alot, ok.&amp;nbsp; Dont assume that&amp;nbsp;many (more than half) dont like raiding because you dont.&amp;nbsp; Dont assume i like raiding in a hardcore guild because i dont really care about being the TOP guild.&amp;nbsp; I enjoy the making progress through raids.&amp;nbsp; So i guess in my personal ideal game: i would start from scratch build a team and advance through all the content to gates of discord, then start over with a fresh untwinked character building up a new guild (with the core of the last guild if they would start over) and do it all again.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;btw, why just compete statistically when u can brag about walking over their&amp;nbsp;dead bodies&amp;nbsp;to get to the mob?&amp;nbsp; seriously dude, their statistics don't matter. stats will always be at some point.&amp;nbsp; the fact that they DONT have any while ur around is what matters.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So your view of ideal raid competition is breaking the eula or fair play rules by training the apposing guilds to steal raid targets.&amp;nbsp; Why play it in this game when theres a whole world out there full of stores, houses, banks all waiting to get robbed?&amp;nbsp; By your standards the epitomy of competition is akin to a professional athlete taking steroids and breaking the rules of the game to win.&amp;nbsp; I think your type of raider&amp;nbsp;and Ty Cobb would have been good friends, oh wait he didnt have friends only enemies...&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;No, its watching them wipe and then getting on the mob.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; But even if I did train, ur idea is still lame.&amp;nbsp; And will never fly.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you claim the other guilds cant kill it but yours can, then who cares if they die in their own instance.&amp;nbsp; While your guild kills it in a seperate instance.&amp;nbsp; I think i know WHY now, you say you prefer to let other guild wipe then kill the raid mob thats low on hps.&amp;nbsp; So maybe your guild cant kill the target and needs someone to hurt it first?&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
