    <description>&lt;div&gt;Can people with the new PoR aura's please post their findings on them (the lvl 55 - 5% one and the lvl 70 - 10% one). How effective have you found them ? Any parses as well would be useful.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Reason I ask is the PoR spells/auras were &amp;quot;release locked&amp;quot; a week before go-live, with the dev in charge saying they would be re-evaluated post release. If we want any changes made to our Aura's during the re-tuning, we need to start collecting information now for feedback.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The feedback I have so far seems to be that they are of minimal use. The 10% aura adds overall about a 1.3% increase in misses via the skills, which is only visible through extensive parsing over many hours. Also the 60' range is very restrictive, especially when added with a monks pulling role.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Here is my 2 cents on what to do. Make it where the monk's aura is where he/she can click it, lasts for 2-3 mins and recast of 5-10 mins, and it nuls all agro in a small range makeing it posible to single pull from a crowed area. not much but its an idea.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

Prathun stated at the fan faire that he would be reviewing auras&#xD;
soon.&amp;nbsp; That was a long time ago.&amp;nbsp; My guess is that they arn't&#xD;
going to review them anytime soon either.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Likewise, I'd doubt that theyre going to change it at this point - I even know Prathun is aware of this bug.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>another suggestion for current aura replacement. what if it gave +1 to DI attack rolls; or -1 on defensive rolls if they want to keep us to a defensive aura?</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;the aura's are bugged, whenever you have it on in a raid setting, it lags out alot of people.  because of that, our guild has basically outlawed them, we are not allowed to use aura's on raids, making all of them completely worthless.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;i don't have the aura's yet.  i've been reading these and other boards that prove them to be broken, so i'm not wasting my time getting them.  (we're working DPoB since we just broke in recently, not working ToB in PoR yet).  i hope SoE realizes that if you don't have the time to do it right the first time, there's no time to do it again.  quit selling the broken content, test it in beta, get the feedback from beta, fix it in beta, THEN make your money.  i say this knowing that they're already working on their next expansion and more broken content.  /em talks to the wall.....&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Several mentioned that it took the form of choppy video. If this sounds like you, do the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without EQ running open up the &amp;quot;Logs&amp;quot; folder in EQ. In there you will find a file called &amp;quot;dbg.txt&amp;quot; - open it up and delete everything in the file. Save and close the file. Next right click on it and select &amp;quot;Properties.&amp;quot; In the properties window check the &amp;quot;Read-only&amp;quot; check box and then click OK.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is happening here is that every tick every Aura gets recorded in this file. (Among other information.) That's a lot of disk access. It's an old bug, but it seems that the auras have pushed more people over the edge of lag.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Took care of all my raid lag issues with Auras.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;thanks for the tip skrax, actually one of my guildies found that on the druid grove and posted it for us already.  i now have the aura but rarely use it.  i'm not wasting 200end for 1% upgrade in dodge skill.  i don't mind that our aura is defensive, soe isn't giving monks anymore dps for a while anyways, but fix the dang thing so it's usefull.  feel like a kid on xmas that got left out, everybody else has a nice helpfull aura cept me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;if you want to change it and make it usefull, make it an endurance regen aura.  also make it work faster if rez effects are on a person.  could lower the effect the more end a person has.  so when a person is rez'd and aura is running, they regen end at 50% faster than normal , once they're at 50% end, the regen would slow to 25% faster than normal, or something like that.  this would give monks a bonus that no other class has.  we'd actually be looked for in pickup groups again. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me and my wife do almost all of our experience duo'ing in the Nest.  I'm a 2.0 monk, about 12k unbuffed hp, shes a 2.0 shaman using Ancient heal and a 36% (iirc) heal focus with all heal aa's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After about 2 hours tonight, I remembered and turned my aura on (the 70 version).  After another hour of chain pulls neither her nor I had seen any difference in the damage I took, or the amount she had to heal me.  After reading the beginning of this thread and the laughable amount of defence this aura actaully gives, I'm not surprised to notice no difference.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Personally I think our aura rocks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With bards and zerkers having the monopoly on dps auras I don't see the chance of monks getting any kind of dps aura at all and even if we did it's actual benefical affect would most likely be very negligable. And even if we did get a change to a dps aura I'd still prefer to keep the aura that we have now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've had 70 aura since the day they added it into the game. Although I've not parsed any dmg taken from it, the effects are noticable on your group during raids especially on mobs that AE ramp, etc... obviously parsing this kind of dmg taken would be nigh on impossible, but if you're a high end raider and you have your aura running I'm guessing you'll see the benefits of this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I appreciate that not everyone is a high end raiding monk, but from my viewpoint I am seriously against any change in our aura at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've never noticed any lag issues at all with my aura since I turned off the graphical effects and I can say for sure that all in my guild that have group beneficial auras use them 100% of the time that we're raiding with no issues whatsoever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In short.... my opinion.... leave our aura alone, don't touch it, don't attempt to &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot; it or change it at all.&lt;br&gt;Big thumbs up from me, a very nice addition to our class and a very good job from SoE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>How about an extra attack per round aura. It would benefit any melee class grouped with us, tank or dps, and it fits into the style of a monk (lots of hits).&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I asked this morning, and have just now asked again, hoping for at least a &amp;quot;yes/no&amp;quot; response as to whether it's going to be reviewed, even if no decision is made as to whats going to happen to it. So far the only response is that QA are currently looking at the availability of the melee 70 Aura on live (&lt;em&gt;which is not exactly what I asked, but at least something&lt;/em&gt;).</description>

      <description>Heh k.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know he mentioned traps and other stuff were going to be reviewed, and he also mentioned how the cleric aura was going to be tweaked (its a CONSTANT % isntead of a capped/rune), so I thought maybe there was some hope for our aura.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If it matters, I would be willing to help him test any changes/tweaks (and stacking on +% items and the aura, since the vibes I got from cleric aura discussion hinted there might be problems with the way he was changing how it hits groups).&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I think we'll get a review of our Aura soonish, will need to be patient as since Rytan is gone someone else has to go over all the spells/auras but I have made a point of making sure that it gets looked at due to the fact that our current aura gives us no benefit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A 1% block and 0.5% riposte mod for group is not worth anything to our class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
