    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Umm I'm still a newbie. Haven't had alotta time to play lateley but I have been trying out a few different classes to find the right one for me. I love my L-10 Dark Elf Necromancer but I think maybe starting an evil race is a bit advanced for me at this time. I'm just not familiar enough with the game enviroment to really know where I can and can't go as a character who is pretty much hated by everyone. :D And all already I've been killed by guards in a couple different areas. I just keep forgetting that no one likes me LOL&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So, I've played a few different classes up to around levels 8 to 9 all of which I liked but last night I tried out a high-elf magician. I got my water elemental and I was just blowing through blue-con rats in the gloomingdeep like they were nothing. Plus I barely used any mana in the process so I was basically pulling non-stop in there. It was awesome! At level 4 I was doing the same thing to all the spiders, spiderlings and even the venomfangs were barely a challenge.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I mean I hate to say it but almost seemed too powerful. Is it just me or is this class really really great? &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It seems I have found the class that suits me best. So far anyways :)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>OK I have to input here.  I am new to the Magician class as well.  I created a Magician under my account on Druzzil Roe and then brought my wife's account up and created a Berserker.  My intention was to learn how to double box from two machines, which is going slowly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well needless to say once I got my pet line of spell I was having some serious fun.  Using the Berserker and the pet to fight I sit back with the Magician and throw out the nukes or whatever damage spells I have.  I can usually bring two mobs at once this way, and keeps me busy for a short bit.  So I can honestly say the Magician class is fun to solo which I have done, but double boxing with the berserker makes it even alot funner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They both are sitting at I believe level 8 and 9 right now as I had to fix a video problem on my wife's computer.  They have been doing the tasks together, and seeing as I don't want to get anybody else killed right now I normally don't group.  So if you see a zany Berserker and crazy Magician pair running around on Druzzil Roe then that is probably me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They have died a few times, but hey it is part of the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is my 1 cp on this topic.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Level 70 Mage here, yes a Mage can and do solo at 70 and inbetween. Just depends on which zone you go to.&amp;nbsp; In my 50's I soloed in OoT the Sea Furys and in JP in the Gnoll Cave in the Pit. Sure I died once in a while but that can happen any time lol. Pets can tank in MpG with a cleric in group and cleric will heal pet just as much as if you had a Pally as tank.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Having your Pet AA's helps here. A&amp;nbsp; Mage that knows how to play there class can also handle a add or two. Myself I soloed mostley to 60 with a group&amp;nbsp;now and then, &amp;nbsp;after 60&amp;nbsp; I found myself in friends group s most of the time.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Necro's are the God class for solo at any level just need to learn your class.&amp;nbsp; Mage pet is a lot better than a Necro's but then they don't solo the same way, so should not compair pets.&amp;nbsp; Each class has there&amp;nbsp; + and -'s just need to play the one you have the most fun with.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Still being a newbie to EQ I decided to take some advice from this board and play a class to 20 (actually 21) and then try something else.&amp;nbsp; So I have a necro to 21 currently (Iksar) and made a gnome Mage on a different server so I would not be tempted to send pp, items to him.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Well, to say they are completely different is an understatement for me :)&amp;nbsp; As the Necro, it took me quite a while to get through the tutorial.&amp;nbsp; Now, yes that was me learning the game and interface so I realize that.&amp;nbsp; However, once I got on the mage, blasted through the tutorial (sorry for the pun).&amp;nbsp; I did miss the ability to heal myself and mana regen, though looking at spells I see the mod rods for mana later on.&amp;nbsp; Another thing that I really liked about the mage was actually the faction thing.&amp;nbsp; I was able to do the crushbone quest with my gnome, not so with my iksar.&amp;nbsp; A lot of the tasks put me in areas where my Necro could get killed if too close.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Mage is 15 and the pet is tearing through things, I truly enjoy grouping with both characters.&amp;nbsp; I see them both adding to any group that will have them.&amp;nbsp; Mages are fun and that is the bottom line when playing :)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;With no snare, root or slows soloing a mage is not a proposition for the weak of heart. But I love to do it. Is it mana intesive? Yes. Are you going to take a few licks now and again? Sure.&amp;nbsp;But with the Elixir of Clarity and Healing&amp;nbsp;potions now,&amp;nbsp;mana regen and healing&amp;nbsp;aren't that much of a problem anymore.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I pull with the Malo line and then send the pet when the mob gets to my kill spot. After the pet has good agro I throw my Elemental DoT spell then heal the pet and wait until the mob is down to about 30% beofore lobbing in my big nuke to finish it off. While I can solo Yellow cons with my Chanter and even Red cons with my Druid, I find that anything above a White con will give me too many resists when soloing my Mage. Having a spell resisted, draws just as much agro as landing it so when you have to recast that DoT or Nuke, you run the chance of stealing agro from your pet. And you don't want that.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I've always felt that one on one a mage can kill a mob faster than and safer than anyone.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The biggest problem I ever had playing a mage is that they have no way of handling a 2nd mob. They never get a root spell.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;I'd have to disagree; fighting 1 blue con mob, a mage who's playing pet cleric well&amp;nbsp;has the situation completely under control; don't have to worry about our slow breaking, root lifting early, a mez getting resisted, etc.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Mages are probably THE most stable class to solo&amp;nbsp;with against single&amp;nbsp;mobs.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;While there are random factors that could get a druid killed while root rotting or snare kiting(mobs resisting, snares/roots breaking early for some reason, etc.); if a mage keeps the pet up to date heal wise, barring adds there's nothing that can stop him.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Yes, while I am in abosolute LOVE with my mage(who's my main and also was&amp;nbsp;my first toon. :smileyhappy: ); and I wouldn't trade my mage for any other class, I will say this much: Mages have have an issue with adds.(which HOPEFULLY will be addressed during the re-envisionment; all mages cross your fingers for a summon: staff of earth spell. :smileywink: )&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Unless you plan on using earth pet&amp;nbsp;FOREVER and working on green cons for hours&amp;nbsp;to use your earth as a ghetto root, expect to be running to the zone line every time you get an add; unfortunately our heal spells aren't at all sufficient enough to keep our pets alive with 2 mobs on them.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And while we can't keep up with wizzies nuke wise....&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; guess who's supplying them with mod rods(turns hp into mana), oh, and who has their pet constantly bashing the mob, oh, and who can DoT the mob with 2 extremely mana-efficient&amp;nbsp;dots(one's at 43, other's at 55) and sit back and med while still doing damage..... and the list goes on and on....&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Overall, don't let a magician's faults to overwhelm you, while we do need a little tweaking here and there, we're definiately better off than other classes and are a blast to play.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Glad to see a new mage out there willing to learn the class!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;Mages are a great soloing class - especially at the lower levels.&amp;nbsp; But the game changes a bit as you get into the higher end.&amp;nbsp; Eventually grouping with other players will become the only way to gain significant xp...and mages arent&amp;nbsp;always&amp;nbsp;a preferred class for an xp group.&amp;nbsp; In choosing a character you first need to choose if you like to tank, dps, heal, or utility.&amp;nbsp; If you like tanking choose warrior, dps choose rogue, heal choose cleric, utility depends on if you wish to be crowd control or enhance your group with buffs.&amp;nbsp; Of course there are classes which combine the abilities of others.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;If you want to tank but also want to have some group utility/ability to solo&amp;nbsp;you can choose to be a paladin (heals/buffs) or shadowknight (FD pulling/group mana at high levels).&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;Dps with utility would be monk (puller), ranger (root/snare/attack buffs/moderate ranged damage), beserker (similar abilities to ranger but less utility, more melee dps focus), Mage (primary attack in the form of nukes...pets and ds, if the tank allows ds, help sustain dps), Beastlord (primary attack in the form of melee...similar to mage with pet, can do basic "shaman" abilities), Necromancer (primary attack in the form of DoTs/nukes, pet to sustain dps, utility in the form of snares/group mana), Wizard (nuker, utility in teleports/punts).&amp;nbsp; Note that in the high end game many mobs resist nukes.&amp;nbsp; The effectiveness of nuking dps becomes sketchy in comparison to melee.&amp;nbsp; Mages and Necros have an advantage over wizards since they have meleeing pets, and mages ds/necros DoTs to deal some dps if nukes are resisted - often, pets are not allowed by Raid Leaders in large raids however.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;Healers with utility are druids (ports, large variety of buffs, nukes, DoTs - possibly the most well rounded class), shamans (primarily utility in the form of group/raid enhancement buffs).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;More pure utility classes are Enchanters (most effective mezzers, important buffs, slow), and shamans (best slowers, and for buffs)...and Bards provide songs with unique properties to the bard class which make them valuable (can also mez and slow).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;You should choose your class based on what you expect to be doing in EQ.&amp;nbsp; If you plan on leveling to 70+ and joining a raiding guild (while raiding guilds accept all classes for good reason) there are some classes which you may enjoy more in the high end.&amp;nbsp; For example, your mage won’t be able to solo as effectively at lvl 70 as it can at level 10.&amp;nbsp; Now, if you don’t ever plan on reaching level 70, and simply play eq for the fun of soloing in the lower level zones then mage might be the best choice...but don’t assume your interests in EQ wont change, as they likely will.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;Mage, similar to any class is a fine choice for the end game...but expect your role and playstyle to change.&amp;nbsp; With a changed role/playstyle you may lose interest in the mage you spend countless hours leveling, which can be devastating.&amp;nbsp; Burn out and loss of interest can ensue in having to start the xp grind all over again with a new character.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT face="Times New Roman"&gt;I wish you luck in finding a class&amp;nbsp;that fits your interest in EQ.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Someone once quoted "My level 57 wizard takes nearly an entire bar of mana to kill a mob that gives decent xp."&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I've got a lvl 67 magician now, and can solo dark blues almost non stop with very little mana usage. I am sure I am not the only one, so maybe the poster of that comment needs to address either how much they nuke or how little they let their pet do the work.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I normally malos the mob back to my pull spot, then send in the pet , making sure it has taunt on. I then wait til mobs about 80% life and toss in my best rain spell. One, maybe two heals on the pet, and one final bolt nuke to finish mob off as he runs is all it takes most of the time. If I am very lucky with getting critical nukes, I can finish a fight with 80% of my mana or more left.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Or maybe the problem is the comment part about "decent exp". If i can get 2% aa on a mob ( I reserve normal exp for fast pull groups, if I can get them ) soloing, and it takes me about a minute to kill the mob, I chalk that up to being decent experience. But since we all have our own definition of decent experience, take that as you may.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;I'm glad you found a class you enjoy. A tip try to avoid boards with a lot of rants about your class (or at least avoid the rants). Every class has some problems and every class board has many people complaining about these problems.&amp;nbsp; It is often more enjoyable if you don't pay attention to all the complaining and just have fun with the class.&amp;nbsp; You can and should use class boards to gain info and ask questions. Just don't take the rants seriously as long as you are having fun that is all that matters :smileyhappy:&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Mage pets could never tank a mob for very long at the upper levels, I thought.  So a mage would be doing most damage with their nukes, not unlike a wizard.  Should have mentioned that.  But maybe that changes with aa's?  Or maybe the few mages I know complain too much?  I don't know.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, playing a 65 necro, I wouldn't have my pet tank a blue mob for very long, unless it was a low dark blue (which wouldn't give much xp), and I always thought they were somewhat comparable to mage pets as far as tanking ability goes.</description>

&lt;P&gt;I thought the same thing until I was in an MPG group with the mage pet as our main tank. Still had a cleric healing it and I assume the mage had some pet AA's but I was still impressed. There are many 65 warriors that can't tank in MPG very well.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Not that high up yet(almost at 58 atm); so I won't give any definivtive yes or no's, but I think it's more that you can't tank them LIKE YOU USED TO, not at all.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Either way, those are post -65 issues and chances are these and pet tankability post 50(which can&amp;nbsp;be a little choppy if you don't really know how to handle your pet)&amp;nbsp;will hopefully&amp;nbsp;be addressed relatively soon.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;I highly doubt it; I believe mage pets are much more reliable than necro pets tank wise.(not to say they don't need some tweaking....*cough*firepet*cough*..... excuse me, I've got a bit of a.... *cough*petheals*cough*... cold)&amp;nbsp; :smileywink:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Yes, my bad for not reading he said wizard and not magician. I had assumed it was a mistype, since the thread was about mages and their problems, not a wizard issue.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Again, sorry I misread or misunderstood the poster I had quoted.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I have known a number of high level Magicians in my day.&amp;nbsp; They are kind of like a Wizard Lite, in that they are the second best nukers in the game, but they do other things too.&amp;nbsp; Numerous times I have been in a group with friends in MPG and the Mage pet has been the tank.&amp;nbsp; However, a Mage's life is not for me, even as one of my myriad alts.&amp;nbsp; I just can't stand the thought of being a vending machine.&amp;nbsp; I got my fill of that when I had my Tolan's Bracer.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Sometimes you find a class that just clicks for you.&amp;nbsp; I'm enjoying my mage, she's 36 now.&amp;nbsp; For years when I first started I had no interest in playing one, thought all they did basically was summon bandages... proves that I can be (and am) wrong about things.&amp;nbsp; It takes awhile to get the hang of the different pets but I've been enjoying soloing and when I group I can see that I do make a noticeable difference in DPS.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Right now though, I've just been working on tradeskilling, research and tailoring. She's getting itchy to level again though.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Glad to hear of somebody finding their niche!  Mages at the high end with a few AA's and gear add quite a bit of damage between pets and nukes, in addition to the ever helpful Call of the Hero spell.  Mage summoned items are always welcome, especially mod rods and pet weapons.  *Forgot about damage shields, yes, I absolutely love mage DS's while I'm tanking!&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Hecubas on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;09-02-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;01:02 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>I've never played a magician before, but had a similar experience with a chanter.  Chanter's pets are mainly just defensive, they don't attack until you are attacked, but I was blowing through DBs, Whites and even the occasional Yellow in the mines.  Thing to remember is that once you get out of the Tutorial is that things change.  I was having problems with some DBs in GFay, especially since you gain aggro more readily outside of the tutorial.  You really won't get a good feel for your toon until about level 20.</description>
