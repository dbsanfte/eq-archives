    <description>I was wondering if anything worthwhile could (or should) bit done with Shaman melee power?&lt;br&gt;I understand our AC cap and basic mitigation is low in proportion to the amount of aggro we can develop by just doing our jobs..... what would be a fair AC cap?  We do get a spell for damage mitigation at the highest levels, but nothing for the leveling Shaman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would a self only line of damage mitigation buffs be of help?  Yes, another buff -- but since that is our main job anymore I thought it would fit.  Maybe 15th level Shroud of Ancestors giving a 4% mitigation, 30th level Shield of Ancestors at 7%, with a last one at 50 Barrier of Ancestors giving 10% -- all buyable spells.  At the cost of two buff slots a Shaman can have 17% mitigation after 66th level (with Sense), not counting AAs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for melee, I do NOT want dual wielding, I am a shield bearer and like it.  With Puma and up, we get (dare I say it?) nearly Beastlord DPS for short bursts, at the cost of constant spell refreshing.  For personal melee use, would double attack (lower cap as a skill or maybe a high inbuilt skill when in bear form?) make any difference to a shaman?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OK, I admit it... I had two coffees with breakfast, a double espresso on the way to work and am currently drinking a Bawls.  Still I think they are good random thoughts.</description>
