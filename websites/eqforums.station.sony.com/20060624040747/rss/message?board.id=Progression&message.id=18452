&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You are wrong. Brad McQuaids original "vision" for EQ was that EVERYONE would be able to find a home in EQ, no matter how much time they had to devote to it, and for a long time it was run that way. There was plenty of content for solo, duo, small group, multi-group, and guild raiders alike. Then Sony took over completely and decided that soloing and small groups were bad and that everyone had to rush to the top of the game and raid 24/7 so they could crank out more and more expansions geared to the high end players. They even destroyed the old progression in many areas by revamping zones like Mistmoore and Split Paw leaving players very few choices of good places to go to get through those levels. It was like the free form factor of the game was being taken away and everyone was being forced through the fastest progression of zones to get them to the top very quickly so they had a reason to buy the latest expansion. Exploring and enjoying yourself on the way up was replaced by an endless grind to get to 70 and fill out your AAs,&amp;nbsp;and getting keyed/flagged/geared for the latest content. Where is the fun? I don't know about the rest of you, I hate when people try to force me to conform to what they&amp;nbsp;say I should be doing, thinking and feeling. I don't like when I am miserable being forced into doing something that I hate and am told there must be something wrong with me for not running around in their rat's maze with a glazed stare and inane grin on my face while singing the "Happy, Happy, Joy, Joy" song. I really hope this progression server is going to be kinder to those of us who actually have lives away from&amp;nbsp;the computer screen. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Not sure I like how the progression server will unlock</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=17584#M17584</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Unless I totally misunderstand, new expansions will be unlocked by certain actions (i.e. killing a boss mob, etc).&amp;nbsp; I don't have a problem with it being unlocked for everyone, because individually it would be too difficult.&amp;nbsp; But, it won't be like it was originally from the standpoint that hardcore players know the strategies and tactics for killing each boss mob, whereas before they had to experiment.&amp;nbsp; What this means is the hardcore guilds will scream through this just for the sake of it and to try and prove how "great" they are.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What this does though, is makes the progression server totally worthless to someone who only plays limited time.&amp;nbsp; By the time I'm lvl 35-40, we already in PoP or Luclin&amp;nbsp; or further.&amp;nbsp; What benefit for the non-hardcore player will there be?&amp;nbsp; Of course I can play just like the new expansions haven't been opened, but that's not the point. I can do that today.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I don't want SoE to hold this server back so it takes 3 years to go through the expansions, but I would like to see&amp;nbsp;timers set so there is some sort of wait period.&amp;nbsp; That way once a new expansion is triggered, there will be a certain timeframe (15 day - 30 days before it's opened up.&amp;nbsp; Make this progression extend over 6-8 months versus, 2 months.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Of course that's just my opinion.&amp;nbsp; As is, I will just stay on my server, if they tweak it some I might consider starting a character.&amp;nbsp; I don't want it to be old school, but if I'm turning lvl 40 and Luclin is open, what kind of progression is that?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;thanks for all the replies.&amp;nbsp; I have found that the progression will not go as fast as I thought and will in fact extent over a long period of time relatively speaking.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And to those that say I am crying because I'm not hardcare or want to server to progress at my rate for whatever - that is not the case.&amp;nbsp; I was merely trying to understand how fast it will progress.&amp;nbsp; I am&amp;nbsp;a casual player, period.&amp;nbsp; I thought it would be unlocked very quickly and that was my concern.&amp;nbsp; I don't care who unlocks and I know I will NEVER be the one to unlock anything.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What I was trying to figure out is this.&amp;nbsp; If it's a scenario where by the time I'm lvl 40-50 the whole server is unlocked (say in&amp;nbsp;2-3 months) then what the point for me personally to move to the server.&amp;nbsp; If it unlocks&amp;nbsp;that fast for me, then it really turns out to be a regular server.&amp;nbsp; Because once it unlocks all expansions, then it really not a progression anymore and everyone moves to the best exp zone and loot regardless.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But some of the posts and replies seem to make alot of sense on how long it will really take to unlock and progress and I kinda like what I'm seeing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Thanks.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;A lot of people who started during SoV and maybe even Kunark also don't know what gear is like in just original eq. Unless they leave Newbie armor and the newer higher money drops like the head and blood from goblins. Then people are going to be fighting over bronze, and begging for banded. I can remember the days of sitting in Greater Faydark and hearing the OOC&amp;nbsp; " making banded 3pp per ac." And without newbie weapons getting a better weapon especiallya magic one is gonna be&amp;nbsp;alot harder than just taking 30-50pp to the bazaar.(Time to do dust off the Langsleax, Morins shortsword, and Thex mallet quest.) To fully and decently equip a Character in old world EQ, required alot of time and work, it's not just doing a few quest from&amp;nbsp; your home town and the PoK or farming money and heading to the bazaar. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As a side note. &amp;nbsp;It will be nice for the quest givers of Totemic, Ivy etched, Ro's, crafted and other such quested armors to get visits again. I bet they have been lonely for a while.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I agree, it will be wierd for people to actually apreciate skin like rock or other HP buffs again. Always was funny when you would see a low level on a normal server and try to throw some buffs their way, only to have the red message tell you it wouldnt take because they had their normal dose/crutch of temp and other high level buffs already!!</description>

&lt;P&gt;I really think everyone is missing the point of this server, and it doesn't matter how fast expansions open up or by what means as&amp;nbsp;I will explain.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Right now if you log onto any regular server and start a new character:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;A: You will have noone to level with, because majority of the populations are 60 plus&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;B: Having expansions open trivializes the low end game, ie PoK traveling ease, or the Bazaar, just buy your gear no need to work for it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;C: Vast wastelands of empty zones that people think are useless.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;How does the progression server change this? You will have a mixed bag of people from hard core 24/7 raiders to the casual couple hours a night person.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Both types of people will find groups easily as there will be several people in your level range, you will meet, get to know, join a guild and "progress" with others&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;that are in your same category. EQ has never been about the game itself, the magic has always been the community feel that the game gives, something other games &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;have never even come close to for several reasons.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Will opening expansions change things? Yes as they open each expansion it&amp;nbsp;will bring it closer and closer to a normal server but, by opening progressively and not having &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;everything open from the start, even if it all opens in under a year it will have succeeded because it will have built an entire new community on the server and will most&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;likely be the largest population server in EQ for a long time to come.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Just opening a new server where everything is open from the start, destroys the community build time that made one of the best games around. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Here here!! Until you are well into your 40's, other players don't need or want you buffs...emergency heals...or your presence in groups. When was the last time, as a low level Shaman or Cleric, did a "drive by" buff landed on a level 10 player? Everyone runs to PoK with their ridiculously easy to obtain plat and buys a temp/Hos/Bai'Li and goes out and kills reds in whatever zone solo. The "old days" were really the good ol days. Your level 12 Shaman throwing a heal on some poor warrior being stomped by a mammoth calf and forming an instant friendship...that Brothers and Sisters in Arms feel is long gone from Norrath...it is a much poorer place for it. I look forward to starting a brand new Shaman and a brand new Druid on the Combine server. I am praying that the game will come alive for me again!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>i can't say to much but just killing a named or all the named&amp;nbsp; will not unlock the server.&amp;nbsp; even the beta testers don't know how to unlock the expansions and from what i can tell ... we wont even know how to unlock kunark once beta ends !  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;i can't beleive im going to say this , i think the dev's have got unlocking new expansions done right . like i said it wont be just killing a raid mob or 2&amp;nbsp; and it wont be done in a few week's / months like i thought before i got into beta .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;First, there hasn't been any announcement of exactly how it will work, so you can't really complain about it yet. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Second, why do you think it would be any different this time around?&amp;nbsp; There was always power-gamers who wanted to level up quick, power up fast, and kill the biggest mobs they can find. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;I was level 25 when Kunark came out.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Level 44 when Velious came out.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Level 55 when Luclin came out, at this point I was doing&amp;nbsp;my Epic 1.0 and lots of Plane of Hate raids (stuff from 2 expansions ago)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I was never in the front of some imaginary "race" to get the mobs dead as fast as possible.&amp;nbsp; Even now, I'm in a guild doing GoD content, which is nearly 3 years old.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Third, I think you underestimate some of the difficulty in the progression.&amp;nbsp; Sure we know how to do a lot of the stuff already, the learning curve is mostly eliminated in that regard.&amp;nbsp; HOWEVER, you still have a lot of TIME you need to invest into your characters, and your guild, in order to succeed. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You need to gear everyone up.&amp;nbsp; You won't kill CT while wearing newbie armor.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; When Kunark comes out, you will have people leveling up to 60, doing epic 1.0s, and gearing up to tackle the big stuff.&amp;nbsp; And what about all the keys?&amp;nbsp; You have Sebillis, Howling Stones, and the VP key quests to do for everyone in your guild.&amp;nbsp; When Luclin comes out, you have entire guilds that need to be VT keyed.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;All of this stuff takes time.&amp;nbsp; There isn't going to be some uber necro soloing dragons triggering the next expansion, it takes a guild full of people, and all of those people need gear, keys, and levels.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Zacatac_BB on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-06-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;11:04 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;First, there hasn't been any announcement of exactly how it will work, so you can't really complain about it yet.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Since when has that ever stopped people?&amp;nbsp; Pre-emptive complaining is what I like to call it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;the hardcore carebears will grind there life away untill they prove there PVE dominance, no matter what sony does they will spend there entire summer proving how good they are and what type of phat loot they can get first&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;what you need to focus on is pvp... so players like myself can go to those uber people and laugh at them, and say to there guild "yo, cloak of flames at gukb zone in" then 5 minutes ... "you have looted a Cloak of Flames." and then 30 seconds later u get a tell saying&amp;nbsp;"*** you *** ur so dead, ur a nerd with no friends rl" etc etc&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
