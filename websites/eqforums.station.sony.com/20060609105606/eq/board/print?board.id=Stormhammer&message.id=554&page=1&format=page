<DIV>ONLY GMs can solve the GM Event loot distribution arguments and HERE IS HOW:</DIV>
<DIV>Make all loot no-drop or don't hand out loot at all.</DIV>
<DIV>Since no loot at all would not be as fun, and we all pay a premium monthly price to have&nbsp;events with some loot,&nbsp;that leaves MAKE ALL LOOT NO-DROP by using the TREASURE CHEST method that has been used in recent weeks.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>People can say "all gm events should be NBG", but some people roll on the items they know they wont wear or weild and then rush to bazaar to sell them 2 seconds later and despite the best of intentions, even NBG ends up as a class-specific FFA.</DIV>
<DIV>People can say "all gm events should be FFA", but then people get mad when a caster wins a haste item, etc.&nbsp; even though all agreed to let it be handled by lotto and results in a similar "run to sell in the bazaar" situation.</DIV>
<DIV>People will say that "gms dont handle no-drop drops and that causes arguments on drops as the raid is trying to move".&nbsp; Yes, this is a new problem since the policy change and yes it brings out the ninja-looter in the jerks on that raid.</DIV>
<DIV>People can say that no-drop is less fun (and I would say that those who&nbsp;think that are probably not there to have fun in the first place and are not attempting to enhance the characters they brought on the raid, but rather are trying to increase their bank account or twink other chars).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Then its the droppable loot itself.&nbsp; It is almost always a CoF or a Fungi.&nbsp; Mr./Ms. GM, if you are going to put a droppable item on a mob, then please pick something that all classes can use and not constantly exclude a few classes - especially items KNOWN to cause loot arguments.&nbsp; CoF and Fungi tunic dropping should STOP RIGHT NOW.&nbsp; It's old, its boring, its unfair, and it shows how unimaginative the GM running that particular event is on that given day.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>I swear there must be a "put a CoF on this mob and a Fungi tunic on the very next mob" hotkey that GMs use.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Simply put, even one jerk on a raid will RUIN&nbsp;a fun 3 hour event when it comes time to distribute droppable loot.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>GMs, please use the more recent tactic of TREASURE CHEST style of loot that is OVERALL BETTER FOR THE EVENT, rather than the "drop and fungi so I as the GM can get out of the raid while the players are left to fight off loot whores, latecomers, and plain rude behavior from other players".&nbsp; Whenever the "treasure chest opened by the GM resulting in no-drop items" method is used, there are no loot problems and it enhances the fun of the event (since its the GM awarding the prizes).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Don't let great events be ruined by the last 5 minutes of loot issues over droppable loot, YOU CAN SOLVE IT for the players and make everyone happier!&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>DEAD SERIOUS HERE.&nbsp;&nbsp;REMOVE ALL DROPPABLE LOOT&nbsp;ON GM EVENTS, &nbsp;MAKE IT NO-DROP STARTING TODAY!!!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV></DIV>

<P>Actually, the fix for that would be to have the GM's distribute loot after the event, and give them a little bit of discretion on which items are being handed out. Its usually a good idea that the items dropping for an event, match the population of the event, not the server as a whole. When an event is designed, give the GM a&nbsp;"custom kit" of items, of which they&nbsp;can award a certain number, but don't force them to choose until the&nbsp;event is assembled.&nbsp; </P>
<P>NO DROP doesn't completely solve the NBG issue either. Let me give this example, I happen to think it would be acceptable if a robe happened to drop that was NO DROP and "similar" in stats to the tradeable robe I'm currently wearing, I would consider rolling on the NO DROP robe, then selling my existing one so I can chase an upgrade in a different slot (or start saving money for OoW spells <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0> ). You will never completely get away from this issue, but it would be nice if casters weren't winning SoD's. </P>
<P>The GM who was on last night did give one warning, and I'll loosely paraphrase: No two GMs are alike, and they all have slightly different theories and preferences as to how loot should be distributed.&nbsp; Personally, I like the idea of seeing a few more NO DROP items, then allowing rolls for people who <EM>can</EM> equip an item. To try and analyze it beyond that adds way too much time to the process. </P>

				<DIV>Its not jsut the GMs here, its the people in the raid, take some responsibility for yourself... its nice to have someone hold our hands and run loot etc; but they cant do everything.&nbsp;&nbsp; I usually recommend a strong raid leader on GM events, since he can solve those problems and allow the GM to get back to storytelling, since loot really is secondary.&nbsp; Alot of people depend on this loot as immediate upgrades or to sell for upgrades etc, I personally don't and almost exclusively decline on loot, but its important for ALOT of people who come.&nbsp; Its a matter of policing ourselves and being civil.</DIV>

				I don't know.  If the gm's set the events, why should they  not be responsible for handing out the loot?  I have seen events where a person has validly won a roll but the raid leader refuses to give said person the loot because the raid leader doesn't think they should have it.  If a GM was the one dealing with the loot, said situation would not happen.   I personally think that as it is a GM event the GM should handle the playout and the loot distribution.

				<DIV>NBG would be nice but it simply can not be done fairly on this server. First we have no idea what everyone owns or are even wearing. Second alot of those under geared people are here for a month just to get better gear and leave so it plays right into their hands, and last it's not real fair when the gms insist on staying with the 51+ level range on events. Obviously the lower levels are going to "need" things worse but in alot of cases those people may be alts compared to other people's mains plus you just automatically elimanate alot of people from every having a chance at anything. And no one stops the level 50s from rolling on some really nice gear that would actually be an upgrade for almost everyone.&nbsp; </DIV>

They were there and did just as much as any other player and there is no reason why they should not get the same chance as anyone else.  I agree there should be 62+ events, maybe the GMs will take that into consideration.

				<DIV>Why even have NBG on a pick up raid. It can't be enforced. For NBG to work on a Pickup it requires everyone in the raid to aggree to it. If one person doesn't agree NBG will not work. With a pickup raid of 40 to 72+ people there will always be someone that will not agree for NBG so it can't really be enforced. For that matter Large Guild Sponsered Raids don't have NBG for the very same reason. That was one of the reasons DKP is used. The idea of RL deciding on who is allowed to get loot and who don't in a GM event is not right and a person should be able to petition if they are ever refused loot if they have won that item fairly. After all the only person that can say if or if not a person that can atttend or loot at a GM event is the GM. Everyone that attends a raid has put in as much effort as the next one so everyone that participated in the raid should have egual rights to roll on the loot. Be it if the person is Time geared or still wearing newbie armor. Otherwise I'll just strip all the gear of my main and bring him to the events nekked. Roll on the NGB because atm I would need it because look, I'm nekked and then sale the stuff in the bazaar and put my time gear back on. But there will always be the few that will demand NBG, but you don't have to give up your looting rights, because of that and the GM will not enforce a NBG rule if everyone does not agree to it. I mean it's not in the TOS agreement that NBG must be used in GM events.</DIV>

<P>I was simply pointing out that people with good gear will rarely have a chance at anything while the lower levels get a chance at everything.</P>
<P>&nbsp;There are a lot of people that agree that the high levels and the level 50s need to be seperated for events and I would seriously doubt there would too many people that would actually perfer the 46 or 51+ events so why haven't they been changed?&nbsp; It is a simple request. It's more than reasonable and it would make the events much&nbsp;more enjoyable&nbsp;for most people. It also wouldn't require anything as far as expense or time for the staff.</P>

				<DIV>Events are basically not worth it. Last night participated in one. Major train(s) in AR made it challenging</DIV>

<DIV>I'd rather do LDON's or raids. At least I know what I am aiming for that way.</DIV>

<P>I'm going to alter my answer a bit from earlier. The events that would support this are the ones where multiple GM's participate. It doesn't fit very well from a roleplay perspective if the guy you're trying to kill is also trying to control the loot distribution. Honestly, if its a free-for-all roll, I don't see why a GM would be needed, as I've never seen a problem with one of our raid leaders managing the rolls.</P>
<P>When it comes to loot, no one will ever be happy.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Level 50ish players get frustrated when high end raiders get items that would be of more benefit to them</LI>
<LI>Players who attend lots of events seem to get frustrated when first timers get nice items</LI>
<LI>First timers get upset if it seems like only long time players are getting items</LI>
<LI>Level 65ish players get upset if a level 49 character tags along, and then rolls heavily on items</LI></UL>
<P>Here's my position: </P>
<P>First and foremost GM Events are about roleplay and interactive fun, whether it be a raid, scavenger hunt, or a dungeon crawl. If you're worried about "gearing up", join a guild, its the best possible way to accomplish this. Now, I don't support the argument that GM events are not at all about the loot either, because as long as nice items are dropping, people will want to participate for a chance to win those items, lets try be realistic about this fact. Personally, I have no problem at all with a full out "greed" roll, once you win, you can't roll on another item in the event (naturally, rolling on the "best" items last). It is really the only "fair" way to handle distribution for "dropped"/tradeable items (you shouldn't be denied a reward for your participation, just because you have good gear already). I also think it would be appropriate if the GM's would "hand out" occasional items as rewards, based on participation. </P>
<P>I think that with OoW coming out soon and the level cap going up, you'll see fewer issues with lower level players tagging along on events that are designed for higher level players. However, try to keep things in perspective, we have a low population server, especially at lower levels, so if someone is trying to tag along on an event that they might be 3-5 levels away from the minimum on, let them. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></P>

				<DIV>ok lemme say something as a vetran event goer ive got somwhere around 2500 events under my belt. ive won a whole 3 things on roll ive lead(been raidleader and incharge of lewt distroy next to the gm)&nbsp;close to 150 or so events. all the gear i wear none of ir was won on rolls i only had&nbsp;2 peices i actively wore after ive won the roll.&nbsp; there is gear ive won on events i will keep wearing till i am in time/god most likely these items ive been awarded for my roleplay skills and my attendance. these events were designed 2 make eq more fun for some of us vetran players that have been around for many years and loot is only secondary to me but i guess that comes w/ the fact that i only roll if 1 of 2 thing; 1. its a upgrade, 2. it's open greed roll cuz its not a upgrade for anyone their(that does not mean a upgrade for their twink only the toon that is present)</DIV>

				<DIV>first off, I don't play on stormhammer, I sort of wish I did, but the fact that I play two accounts just doesn't make it economically feasible.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The rewards for GM Events have always been really nice, in general.&nbsp; However, (even on the nonpremium servers) a better system could be devised.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>In fact, the framework is already in the game, thanks to LDON.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>For stormhammer, an "event points" pool could be created, where by attending, players are given points to spend on gear they choose.&nbsp; Special rewards could still be awarded for people who would normally earn them, though everyone who attends would be assigned a number of points.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>All this would take would be a little work on the GM Client to allow a command to assign the points.</DIV>

				<DIV>Well hopefully today proved that there is high demand for tighter level restrictions on events. We had just under&nbsp;a full raid on a weekday morning for the 60-65 raid. Now if they can just tune the events to be at least a little challenge for the force assembled. It will also be interesting to see the turnout for a 50-60 event. Hopefully they will have one soon.</DIV>

				<DIV>Well this is my 2 cents worth.....&nbsp;&nbsp; I left stormhammer over the gm events - period.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Why ?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>They were terribly unfair.&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing many many raids I&nbsp;got some potions and one ring that to my lvl sucked BIG TIME and 2 aa.&nbsp;Thats it! </DIV>
<DIV>the only 2 events i saw anything worthwhile 1.&nbsp; was in the arena it dropped great&nbsp; stuff and i was there for the whole fight but no one would let me in a group so no i couldnt roll.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
<DIV>I saw a druid get a mana +2 ring for healing the&nbsp;event host&nbsp;(I couldnt have possible win it cause im a mage)&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV></DIV>
<DIV>2.&nbsp; I did the second part of a two parter (I had to work the first part) .&nbsp; It was a long fight and took twice as much time as the first part.&nbsp; Well great stuff did get given away to the people but not to me cause I wasnt there for both.&nbsp; I got nothing.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Thats the night i put my notice in to be transfered back and left stormhammer.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Who cares? no one but me -&nbsp;every time i play eq i remember these things and it makes me feel bad.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>I strongly support no drop stuff (my ring was)&nbsp; and i strongly support giving stuff to all that earned it even if you have to do it twice in a 2 part or 3 times in a 3 part everyone one should be treated fair!</STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>As for the rest I dont even care about loot - I have been playing EQ for 5 years - But I do care about fair.&nbsp; Loot becomes obsolete over time...&nbsp;&nbsp; whats great today will be useless tomorrow.&nbsp; </STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>
<DIV><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>Heres an Idea&nbsp;- Why not let&nbsp;&nbsp;the classes roll before finding out whats on the table and a special item made up for the winners of that roll - maybe something that they could use?&nbsp; Maybe something unique?&nbsp; Thats what i though it was when i first came to stormhammer....&nbsp; But thats to simple having casters roll and finding a mage with a terrible robe and wow a brand new with a few nicer stats?&nbsp; </STRONG></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>the conversation would go like this - </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Gm - and proud as the winner of the roll for casters what item would best suit you.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Proud - well my rings are kinda low would you have anything better than this (<FONT color=#6633ff>jade earring</FONT><FONT color=#ffffff>).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#ffffff></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#ffffff>Gm - ah yes try this (&nbsp;<FONT color=#cc00ff>electified earing of the tempest</FONT>&nbsp<img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0> on u might find it nicer!</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#ffffff></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#ffffff>Proud -&nbsp; Wow thanks GM this is something i can really wear.&nbsp; Thanks all to the raid it was very fun!</FONT></DIV></STRONG></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Grr I hate to see something like the events run so poorly! When they can be so much fun.&nbsp; </DIV>

				<DIV>Well Humper, I hear ya. I left SH too, both for the long LFGs and events. I actually won a roll for a spell. However I had all of my spells as a ranger level 60, a fairly easy task.&nbsp;So I asked for a higher level spell.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Mind you, the event became very difficult due to a major train brought by an unrelated guild. Lots of deaths. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>So, because it was taking time to sort out and the raid party was waiting for other rolls, I told the GM to deal with this after all other items were distributed since he/she refused to give me a higher level spell or a comparable item.&nbsp;Long story short, I got NOTHING out of that roll. I moved out that weekend and am still bitter.</DIV>
