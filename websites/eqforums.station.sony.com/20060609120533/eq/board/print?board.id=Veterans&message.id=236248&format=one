<p>i do agree that this zone needs looked into though, im not keyed, and since no one ever goes there, highly doubt ill bother with it, its easier to get VT groups/raids then it is for VP. they need to do something to make this place worthwhile going to, and forcing certain races to kill here for tradeskill drops really wasnt the answer, lol.<br>

<p></p></blockquote>Can't you apply this same logic to about, I don't know, 200 other zones in EQ? Why should VP specifically need to be looked at, compared to a zone like Western Wastes or The Deep, for example?<br><br><hr></blockquote>CT needs to be looked into. And when I say that, I mean ALL of the reptile mobs there need to drop some goddamn Great Reptile Hides and not in some messed up 1:100 ratio like they already drop at off of the Raptor mobs in there.<br><br>Edit: Or VP needs its mob density lowered and the wandering see invis mobs taken out to make it possible to solo, albeit still inefficiently, for Great Reptile Hides.<br></div><p>Message Edited by Juzam_Djinn on <span class=date_text>06-07-2006</span> <span class=time_text>08:19 PM</span>
