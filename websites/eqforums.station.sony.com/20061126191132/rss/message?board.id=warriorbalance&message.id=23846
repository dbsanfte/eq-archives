    <description>Everyone who visits this forum sees the class description thrown&#xD;
around... alot.&amp;nbsp; It's almost like a mantra.&amp;nbsp; So I figure why&#xD;
not discuss it some all by itself.&amp;nbsp; First, let me go ahead and&#xD;
type it out.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
The Book of SOE&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Visionations 1: 6-9&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
6&amp;nbsp; And the Vision did create the classes, and to each &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
was given talents according to what Norrath needed&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
to make it whole and complete.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
7&amp;nbsp; First created were the druids, for they were all&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
women and beautiful to behold.&amp;nbsp; They were given &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
leather and large busts.&amp;nbsp; And the Vision saw it was &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Gu-ud.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
8&amp;nbsp; Next came the shaman and they were made in &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
the image of barbarians of the north.&amp;nbsp; Tall, strong &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
and possessing amazing cleavage, these women&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
would help keep the cold at bay.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
9 Then did the Vision reach an epiphany and said&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
"I need warriors", thus the class description was &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
created-&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Warriors shall be the masters of armed combat and defense, takign the&#xD;
point in battles and going head to head with the most dangerous&#xD;
creatures of Norrath.&amp;nbsp; Warriors are a melee class with the ability&#xD;
to wear plate armor and wield all types of weapons.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Warriors build their strength and stamine to unheard of levels, making&#xD;
them far hardier than any other class.&amp;nbsp; When combined with their&#xD;
heavy armor and excellent defensive skills, warriors are unmatched in&#xD;
tehir ability to survive the most brutal battles.&amp;nbsp; Warriors train&#xD;
themselves in the skills of combat, mastering teh use of all weapons&#xD;
and tactics.&amp;nbsp; Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making&#xD;
themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less&#xD;
resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
So there it is in all it's glory.&amp;nbsp; I'd like to sit here right now&#xD;
and type out my thoughts on it, but I need to get to work.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
Instead I'm going to post this now so I don't have to retype it later&#xD;

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Would have to be done with instance's more then likely, if possible at all today. No idea though, out of my league.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The important thing is to note that the game is fun, when your achieving more then one more AA. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In my opinion, there should be alternate way's of doing several things. For experience/AA or regular, there should be plenty of search and destroy type quest's, and or just zone's that need to be "tamed" so to speak. They might not give you anything you can use, outside of a twink item here and there, but the experience and challenge of the zone should be good, and cover quite a bit of level's, from casual to high end content. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I remember levelling up, place's like Najena, befallen, the Common's, all had a great variety of level's. Later Sol A, probably Crushbone (never really got into it though), Paludal as well... you could find at least 10 level's of experience in these zones, from the time you could survive zoning in. Later Sol B, VT, Luclin zone's, and even later POP zone's... All gave you a ton of different level's and people from different progressional point's could just go to different spots in the zone's, and have great experience (for that time period). &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now it seem's that everytime a new expansion is brought out, there is no reason to go back to the last one's, for anyone really. Outside of a quest here and there.&amp;nbsp; If you can survive the initial zone's of the expansion, then ussually, your good to go for the rest of it, if you just gear yourself as you go, Casual or Raider.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Then there should be the zone's like UP (Using old school zone's as an example), where you can check for name's, round up some guildie's, and go work on them. Not just raid mob's that only raider's can handle, I mean the one's like old day's, where a group of people from all aspects of the game, could come together and kill these things, for the bragging right's as well as the /random 100 Loot Right's. Mob's that are do-able, but not necessarily farmable (no-trade/drop item's, level required). Where if your beyond that point in progression, your not going to be really into killing it, unless you just like ruining things for other's (Or you want to help them).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Finally, the questing and unlocking content, the stuff for both casual and Raider alike. They could have probably easily fixed alot of the itemization problem with quest/flag trivial stuff, if the experience of doing it was valuable... Maybe a certain amount of experience, which you determine if AA or not. If the tasks gave everyone a couple of AA's at the end, they probably wouldn't mind doing them as much. Time vs Reward anymore, not Risk vs. Reward.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Unfortunately for me, the game has hit me as being very repetitive, and I have lost interest in alot of aspects of play. Seem's like the more stuff that come's up, the weaker the last content become's in spades. It's unfortunate all the way around, for everyone. Sound's like the doing over and over again of thing's that casual's do (farming for armor quests, certain ingrediant's, bassically, killing the same stuff day after day after day), are hitting the high end as well... &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;All thing's could be changed to make the game more fun, and a little bit harder probably as well. However, this is not the route they have been going, for a while now. Seem's to sound like the progression this time around, was purposely made to take alot more time, rather then skill, to get through. &lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Exphero wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Then you would have an everchanging group experiance that would be fitting for all levels of progression.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've suggested this approach in the past. Here's the problem in a nutshell:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Game A:&lt;br&gt;You don't know about and can not encounter content much beyond your party's capability. Try to cross from the n00bie zones into the next more difficult zone before you are ready, and "You tremble in fear at what you glimpsed in the distance and turn back."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Game B:&lt;br&gt;It's perfectly fine for SoE to put Unkillable_Mob_01 in a zone. EVERY mob and every zone is the challange that it happens to be. IF you decide to take it on, then it's caveat emptor. No whinning it's Tooooo Haaaard or that you need 3 Clerics/6 groups/or a bucket of hand grenades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Game C:&lt;br&gt;A combination of A&amp;amp;B. Wanna see PoTime? Then PROVE you are "worthy" by joining a guild and doing the flags (or now having a guild gimp you in). Hmmmm Hulcor... I wonder if our group can beat him. We've got a Druid MH and a level 50 SK MTing. I'll bet we can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People want to complain about content that's locked to them? Go single group Hulcor - he's right out in the open. People upset because&amp;nbsp; Shadowhunter wanders around loose and eats them? Go do a Nest instance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We've already got MM's where level, class, and equipment mean nothing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I personally prefer Game B. But Game C accomdates everyone IF they go to where they are accomodated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;The raid instance from these zones drops really good gear. I saw a 45ac 450 hps earing last night, paladin only, and a 70 ac 450 hps bracer from a trash mob that was sk only. So the uber gear is certainly there in the instanced raid zone part of TSS. Considering that, I don't think upping the ac on the regular named mobs in the casual zone would hurt anything. The hps are half what the raid area drops.</description>

&lt;P&gt;I don't know. I have a casual friend who has been in Ashengate and Frostcrypt and he basically has gear from&amp;nbsp;MPG group trials and DoN crystals...The stuff that droped for his group,&amp;nbsp;off mobs that would be considered hard for a casual group, droped gear even he couldn't upgrade with. It wasn't the hps so much as the ac is way too low. For a warrior to tank decently, ac is as important as hps.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My friend is a rogue by the way and even he couldn't improve the ac he had with the new drops.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sounds like an itemization problem. Something I think they really need to do some more studying with, and with the old zone's as well.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Risk is not really a part of the game anymore (not that that's a bad thing), however..&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Maybe it's time to drop the Risk vs. Reward era, and go into the Time vs. Reward. This zone sound's (from your example) totally off base in the way of itemization. It's not just you either. I have been seeing it on the veteran boards as well.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;SOE would do alot less worse, then to kind of take a breather, a step back... and upgrade the entire game with rewards (not just handfulls in "hot zones") that people can actually use. Time vs. Reward.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I was feeling like the game is becoming a big time sink, when I slowed my playing down. It's alot easier to just have fun playing with friend's, then worrying 'bout what I can or can't use. I pass on all drops anymore, even the one's I can use. Just isn't important to me anymore. If it will bring a smile on someone's face (if they can actually use it), then good for them:-)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Time Vs. Reward should probably start to be an issue now, as the risk for everything has bassically become very minimal.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Actually, that's part of the reason things are as they are in group content. The drops off single group mobs was basically Qivic in stats. That would be a hard mob to tank for a Time geared warrior and very difficult for a Time geared knight. However, as&amp;nbsp;I understand what the dev's where saying, that's what the mobs difficulty has to be set for. Meaning any tank with better than Qivic is allready "geared up" for those mobs.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Haveing the mobs set for DK geared tanks and only drop Qivic quality was way beyond the risk/ reward factor. The dev's nerfed the mobs because they couldn't up the reward based on the seperation they wanted between raiders and casuals. I agree with the cleric ( sorry I keep forgeting names) They should&amp;nbsp; have made certain zones restricted via keys so the risk/reward could be more favorable to higher end raiders. The open zone prevented that, ince casuals could get in there, mobs had to be tuned around the highest geared casual. Least that's how I understand the developers explaining the nerf.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I was tanking Dire and Ice at 71, includeing several named. Some mobs were noticable tougher than others, but because&amp;nbsp;I have decent gear they weren't overboard. It's just difficult to maximize content between raiders and casuals when they are in the same zone. Hard for me will be too tough for them and they have to cater to the largest segment of the population, wich in this case is casuals. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I understand what your saying Jazz, but with higher end peeps, they can fudge those numbers more because of the gear difference. Even with out the levels, because many mobs are based on high end casuals at 75 and many high end raiders have better stats at level 70 than the casuals would have at 75. &lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The thing is it's too vague when talking about the different things they intend for, without an outright, direct statement, involving exactly what we are talking about. That's why I hate it when reference's to old thing's a Dev say's are quoted, over and over again.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I only had a problem with group make-over, if I remember right. This is going into something else, and I am not going to say anyone is wrong (besides Naubu, lol), Shar and Llu both have good points. Being no expert on what they want, or what they invission, or how it's intended to REALLY be, I cannot sit here and say your wrong.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A thing about talking Raid and Casual. Are we talking the majority, or just the top of the line? This needs to be clear before carrying a conversation like this as well. If your talking the normal highest amount of raider progression, they aren't in the best stuff yet. If your talking the highest two or three guild's on each server, then they are very well equipped, etc.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;However, as I was trying to point out, a Casual Warrior, that has done all the Casual stuff up to the last expansion, is going to be better equipped then the average Raiding warrior. Since the average raiding warrior is going to be a couple of expansion's behind. Then again, that same raiding warrior might also have done the casual group stuff as well, so then he would then have higher quality gear.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I totally aggree with risk vs reward, but this can be talked about a bit too... IF the casual zone is hard, and the reward is justified... We would have posts from Raider's saying that the single group content, Has Reward's that they shouldn't be allowed to get. How come a Casual can get with a group, what it took me a whole raid to get? They won't say, well, if they can gear up good enough to do the group content (that is hard), and come up with good enough strategies to defeat the mob's, etc... they should be able to get it. That's not going to happen though.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;For the people who will actually be using the drops, warriors do have a real advantage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A warrior is going to get to the point where they can just barely tank something before a knight, and then to the point where they can tank it comfortably first too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think this is fine, especially for open zones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What sucked was some of gates instance content which was balanced around a combination of /disc tanking and maximum possible dps. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-edit, Jazzy by raiding I mean ppl doing anguish and on (those who are not, despite what they might say, genuinely casual raiders). And actually maybe you're right now with tss. A full set of the new armour and drops probably would make such a warrior tank better than a coa knight some of the time (especially when disc'd).&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Naubi on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;10-11-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;09:18 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;That would technically make all higher end raid knights perfectly capable group tanks even for the hardest group content. My gear all ready exceeds what the drops are even in Ashengate and Frostcrypt. So that asks the question, what is the standard for group content? I'm much better geared than a casual warrior and can certainly tank anything they can. The developers allready stated they can't have really nice gear drop from group mobs because it would mess up the difference between raiders and casuals.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;That being the case BB will never have a group mob that he has to tank that I can't because we are both consistant raiders. While there is several mobs that would be better for a warrior to tank than a knight on the casual end, it dries up at the upper end. That's just the nature of the beast, raiders aren't casual players and can't be compared via that "class" bit in a group encounter. A high end raider, be they warrior or knight, are just massive tanks that are overgeared for group content anyhow.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;No Shar, your skimming and not reading what I said.&amp;nbsp; AA's, Gear, and Level's, was all part of what I said. So YOU Going into the hardest content at level 70, and being able to do it is not what I was saying. However, if you take the time to level up first, and your gear is truly higher then what is available in that zone (I mean, if there is a neck item on a named, your's is better, etc.), then yes, by all means, you should tank be able to tank it (with the AA's meant for the challenge as well). &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I know this game is very much gear dependant, rather then how well someone play's the game, So yes, I understand that a top of the line Knight, with the best of the best probably will be able to do all of the above without one level being added. However, I don't think this makes the game "Fun" as much as just gear dependant. The point about the boring progression/trivial progression of this latest expansion is a kind of example of what I mean.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;All I am saying is that the point made about 6 chanter's in a group, although being a drastic comparison, was pretty much on the money. You should have to take consideration of group make-up, especially in the hardest zones.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Trivial content, you grab a tank/healer/puller/dps and go. Hard content should require you to be a bit more thoughtfull with it. What class will be best for pulling (Is it outdoors/indoor's), do they need to be a certain level, and have a certain spell? Should I get a Warrior, Pally or SK to tank? Can a Druid do the job, or do I need to get a cleric? Do we need a snarer? Who can slow better?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I want someone to have to say, "WoW, this is tough content, we're going to need a slower! If the tank is a Knight, better get a Shammy for slowing and back up heal's!"&amp;nbsp; "Make sure you get a cleric here, it's a bit much for a Druid!" "We need a Bard to pull this one, Monk's wont be able to split them very well" " Grab an SK to pull, they hit really hard!" "Grab us a Pally, these guys are undead!"&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Something like that, some kind of thought being put into it, rather than just saying "Hey, I'm&amp;nbsp; an uber raider, and I should be able to solo this without anyone cuz I'm so uber!!" or "Hey, This is unfair, I have better gear then all Casual Warrior's, why should I need them to kill these RED conned normal mob's in the hardest groupable content?" "I don't see why a Druid or a Shammy can't heal me here, you should make the mob's not hit so hard, so I can grab any healer I want for the Hardest groupable content!"&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Just use your head, and make a group that works. I understand people have certain friend's that they ussually group with, so add a couple more to it, and take turn's. There is nothing wrong with having to do a little thinking for groupable content. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"The degree of sucess, or degree of preferred sucess are two different things (as the former depends on teamwork, the latter perceptions of how classes ought to play to accomodate whatever situations). Of course if one wanted the most efficient group, to breeze through the hardest content with the lowest failure rate, then you'd take the best of the best."&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Bassically, that is a perfect paragraph (typo's are allowed with me). &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"The devs have stated all of an archtype should be able to cope with content provided they are of the adequate gear progression."&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I read the re-envisionment stuff, yet have seen nothing new on it at all. However, If this is what the Dev's want, then too bad for anyone wanting a challenge that is doing the hardest content out there I guess. This means it's going to limit them to only having a challenge when forming a raid, which would have to get boring after a while. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"The devs have stated...." That statement to me is a mouthfull. To me it mean's that you should be able to take a Pally/Druid/Beastlord/Bard and fill in last two slots with any other class outside of Monk/Warrior/Cleric/Shammy/Chanter, in ANY Content, be it hard or otherwise, as long as they are at the right progressional phase (which everyone takes as beat the last expansion).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But what if that statement means, the right progressional stage is after they have tackle'd the content in the CURRENT expansion? This would mean you would need to progress a bit before being able to hack out the hardest content with Any of the Archtype's. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Well then there is a solution, make it that the server scans the group makeup and adjusts its difficult based upon constants that are randomized.1 peice of gears stats randomly would do it. Say a ring in one occassion bp the next and overall group hp. Then you would have an everchanging group experiance that would be fitting for all levels of progression.&lt;BR&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Your talking specifically the 13k+ End game Knight's in comparison with a DoD/PoR casual tank. But MOST Raid Knight's are not in the end zone's. 3/4th's are not even in PoR raid content, and over half is not even done with DoN or OOW, let alone GOD. So technically, your wrong, sorry, it's not a moot point.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My personal theory on the Raid vs Casual changes with every expansion.&amp;nbsp; Though PoP is still a raid zone by all means, it's rewards, by and large, are worse than you can get via tradeskills/exp groups.&amp;nbsp; A Time geared tank to me is no different than a normal exp grouped tank.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;With the Tier 2 armor, we're now looking at anyone raiding up to Qvic falling into the exp group category now.&amp;nbsp; So mostly, raid tank would fall somewhere in the range of MPG Raid Trial + area.&amp;nbsp; That's how I see it atleast, not everyone will agree/disagree, but that's my personal view on it.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I'm double posting here cause it is a longer post and I didn't want to loose it if timer ran out.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I use a shield in all content, solo, group, raids. I just like doing it that way,&amp;nbsp;I have a pet to help in dps and honestly a block is a block. Defense wins games more than offense does. If&amp;nbsp;I kill too slow then&amp;nbsp;I can always grab a rogue or something for dps, solo xp sucks anyhow. People have the&amp;nbsp;choice now, warriors will too, and that's a cool thing.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;BB, warriors are getting stuff&amp;nbsp;I think is fine, even things&amp;nbsp;I openly supported. Your bezu and mock on seperate timers and aa's being used to help onehanded dps when useing a shield. ( aa's is the way&amp;nbsp;I suggested it would be corrected anyway) Nothing I see is going to drive knights underground, sure it well help warriors compete more fairly in group content, wich I'm ok with. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The 5 levels you like so much&amp;nbsp;is going to be gone in a few months and not really an issue. So ok maybe your defensive allows you the ability to fight mobs 5 levels too high, but since we can get those levels, that doesn't bother me. I all ready have the gear. Besides, part of the thrill for me is tanking mobs other people, particularly warriors,&amp;nbsp;think&amp;nbsp;I shouldn't. Sk's and sanity don't mix.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;That ability is why warriors who do know me trust me, they know when things go to hell I'm capable of handleing it and won't be dead in 2 seconds. They know I got thier back, and can step into the breach&amp;nbsp;for brief periods if&amp;nbsp;I have too. Ok I admit thatsometimes&amp;nbsp;I want to step into it reguardless,&amp;nbsp;but that's just me not knights in general. I'm nuts afterall:smileytongue:&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Sigh, BB I never said RSS was too hard, I was able to tank there when&amp;nbsp;I was a casual and well under geared for it. I think my concern at the time was that the zone didn't drop gear&amp;nbsp;I could upgrade with to increase my surviablity,( standard named, not the raid&amp;nbsp;mobs, and believe me chaltha to casuals was a raid mob)&amp;nbsp;wich&amp;nbsp;I thought unfair. My gripe was basically that any zone&amp;nbsp;I can progress to, just via leveling, should have the gear drop&amp;nbsp; off mobs&amp;nbsp;I can fight that would upgrade me enough to ease the clerics heart condition she developed keeping me alive. ( I realize now that they had hp augs and ac augs that would do that, at the time I didn't, thus why&amp;nbsp;I made that arguement)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now with raid gear I can tank 2 slowed easily and prolly a third now with DS added to my arsenal. Yes&amp;nbsp;I know, raiding got me&amp;nbsp; there, but should it have? Raiding should be more than just being able to do standard content so easily I can duo with a shaman everywhere or solo MPG ( wich&amp;nbsp;I did the other day). While that might impress the local casuals, they really need to have a way to design instances or zones where the gear really does matter and if you don't have it, you can't get in.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;To me, it's about fairness. If a zone is open on level basis alone, then people should be able to fight there when they reach that level..or at least get the upgrades from regular mobs that would let them fight there. Otherwise they shouldn't be allowed in there. Some bars allow you to enter when you reach 21, others you have to have a cover charge. Set it up like that, some zones you have to have certain items from certain raid zones as a cover charge to get in. Like the Anguish signant, if the zone is talored around level 75 plus Anguish gear then only peeps with the Anguish signant can get in.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;BB, you or ok with knights tanking raid bosses at times, but take offense when they are picked to fight mustargs? I don't understand exactly what you mean? If the knights have managed to gear up to handle the boss then the sidekicks shouldn't be much problem either? Wich is it that bothers you so much? A progressed knight with the proper gear steping in when needed or a undergeared knight being asked to step in?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Sharbreena on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;09-19-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;07:57 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>
