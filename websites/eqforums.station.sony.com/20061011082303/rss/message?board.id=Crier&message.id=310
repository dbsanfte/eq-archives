&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff9900&gt;&amp;lt;Calelena&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Welcome to another great Stratics house of&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; commons with the developers of EverQuest! Tonight's topic is &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; General Topic. So please keep your questions to this topic. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Kytherea&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Good evening everyone!&amp;nbsp; I am Christina Delzer&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; the Community Relations Manager for EverQuest.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Rashere&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Good evening everyone.&amp;nbsp; I'm Travis McGeathy,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lead Designer for EverQuest.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Vahlar&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Hi, I'm Holly Longdale. Assistant Lead Designer&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;on EQ!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; Thanks for coming everyone, I'm Jason Mash&amp;nbsp; (Maddoc) and am an Assistant Lead Designer on the EQ team.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Ngreth&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Hello, I am Ngreth Thergn, Game Designer&amp;nbsp; specializing in tradeskills.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Hello all.&amp;nbsp; I'm Jonathan Caraker, or "Prathun",&amp;nbsp; the spells designer for EverQuest.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Oshran&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Hello everyone.&amp;nbsp; I'm Kevin Carter (Oshran), Game&amp;nbsp; Designer for EverQuest.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*jimjohnson*&lt;/FONT&gt; What is the status of the&amp;nbsp; progression server?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; I've been reading up on all of the threads on&amp;nbsp; the Progression Server forum on the eqforums, getting familiar &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; with what you guys see as the problems and coming up with&amp;nbsp; solutions to most of them. I've got some documentation and &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; notes on what needs to be taken care of. We've also got the&amp;nbsp; hardware up and running, so I should be able to start any &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; implementation that needs to be done starting Monday.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Shmeeve*&lt;/FONT&gt; With the planned removal of the&amp;nbsp; tutorial for the recently announced progression server, what &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; strategies are being considered to deal with congestion in the&amp;nbsp; classic Everquest 'newbie' zones?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; It's interesting that you mentioned that&amp;nbsp; because we were just discussing that very subject in my office &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; prior to the chat. We're still discussing options on that&amp;nbsp;subject, but I can say for sure that we are aware of it and &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; will make some adjustments to ease the congestion as much as&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Croix_FV*&lt;/FONT&gt; Rangers and Zerkers were recently&amp;nbsp;given a mitigation increase to fix balance issues amongst &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; non-tanks. What is being done to ensure that mitigation/avoidance balance issues are avoided amongst non-tanks, and between &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; tanks and non-tanks.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Rashere&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; The changes to mitigation for those two classes&amp;nbsp;was to give them a bit of a boost over tanks who simply &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; shouldn't have the same mitigation, but did previously.&amp;nbsp; It was&amp;nbsp;more of a fix than anything else.&amp;nbsp; We're keeping an eye on the &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; effects, though, and will make adjustments if it is warranted.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Croix_FV*&lt;/FONT&gt; Will Knights be receiving upgrades&amp;nbsp;to their respective aggro lines in order to stay with the &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; increasing aggro generation by DPS/Debuff classes?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Aggro generation was a hot topic at Fan Faire,&amp;nbsp;both for those classes who wanted it... and those who didn't &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; particularly like being attacked.&amp;nbsp; I'll be evaluating aggro&amp;nbsp;across the board before making any firm decisions, but there's &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; a very good chance that knights will receive abilities in the&amp;nbsp;future that help in keeping casters and debuffers off the top &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; of the hatelist.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Chanaluss*&lt;/FONT&gt; With the announcement of the&amp;nbsp;Progressive server, many people have been wondering about the &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; fate of the Guktans. since many LoY features are very useful&amp;nbsp;for the entire server, will there be a chance of the guktans &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; going live on the progressive server before LoY zones are&amp;nbsp;launched?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Vahlar&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; The fate of many races are determined by the&amp;nbsp;players' actions on the progression server.&amp;nbsp; The Iksar, &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; Guktans, and Vah Shir will all remain under lock and key (or&amp;nbsp;continent) until those expansions are unlocked. The same will &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; occur with the features available with each expansion. &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Croix_FV*&lt;/FONT&gt; What is the current status of&amp;nbsp;Sullon Zek in Deathknell and is there an ETA on a fix?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; I presume you're talking about Sullon Zek in&amp;nbsp;Razorthorn and the zone-crash related to her event -- This &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; crash was located late in the afternoon yesterday and, while we&amp;nbsp;did fix it last night, it was too late to push the fix to all &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; live servers. We pushed the fix to our internal test servers&amp;nbsp;and had our QA team verify the fix first thing this morning and &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; then had the fix pushed out to all live servers shortly&amp;nbsp;thereafter. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; The fix should currently be live. Also, another&amp;nbsp;concern about the zone that was brought up was the NPC's in the &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; zone that seemed to have no mana, even though they can cast&amp;nbsp;spells. This fix should also be live.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Sullon Zek would like to note that she lives in&amp;nbsp;Razorthorn, not Deathknell.&lt;BR&gt;* Prathun teases Croix_FV.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Kard*&lt;/FONT&gt; Is there an eta yet on the progression&amp;nbsp;server? Or even an eta of when an eta will be announced? Also &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; as all servers are named after something in the game I suggest&amp;nbsp;the new server is called Lord Doljonijiarnimorinar or just &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; Doljonijiarnimorinar&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Rashere&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Right now, we're in the planning phase for the&amp;nbsp;expansion.&amp;nbsp; We're hammering out the details and figuring out &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; exactly what needs to be done.&amp;nbsp; Once that's done, we'll have a&amp;nbsp;better grasp on when the server will be available and there &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; will be more official press announcements with those details.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Rashere&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; expansion = server&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Wycca*&lt;/FONT&gt; Greetings, any chance you could remove&amp;nbsp;the monk weight penalty? It's sort of outdated in todays game &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; and serves no real fuction besides providing itemiztaion&amp;nbsp;problems and annoyance!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Rashere&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; The monk weight penalty is simply a part of the&amp;nbsp;class.&amp;nbsp; Every class has its quirks and having to manage your &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; weight is part of being a monk.&amp;nbsp; We don't have plans to remove&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Nedrom*&lt;/FONT&gt; When can we expect a fix for the many&amp;nbsp;problems encountered when charmed by an NPC?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; I've received a decent amount of information&amp;nbsp;from the players on the problems that they've been having with &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; Charm in general, especially when it's used in higher end&amp;nbsp;events and encounters. Our QA has verified a good portion of &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; them and issue-tickets have been created on everything they've&amp;nbsp;found and assigned to the programmer&amp;nbsp; team. I know that they've &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; fixed at least one this week, so they are being looked into and&amp;nbsp;worked on.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Cinexa*&lt;/FONT&gt; Hi guys! Hope everyone's hard at work&amp;nbsp;on the next expansion!&amp;nbsp; Any idea when Deathknell will get a &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; look see ~ word is it's mostly impossible atm bringing back&amp;nbsp;visions of uqua, tacvi, etc...any info on this?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Feedback from players currently raiding in&amp;nbsp;Deathknell has indicated that fighting the equivalent of four &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; Zi-thuuli's simultaneously is, at best, a logistical nightmare.&amp;nbsp; I've removed the stun and blur ability from the Deathknell &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; Enforcer gargoyles on Test and will try to get this pushed out&amp;nbsp;to Live as soon as possible.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Tranlin*&lt;/FONT&gt; While I don't speak for everyone,&amp;nbsp;With the large number of sucessive expansions released I feel &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; like I can not keep up with all the new content. My guild isn't&amp;nbsp;super hardcore but we are fairly high end. I think that EQ most &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; certainly needs a breather from quick expansions, will there a&amp;nbsp;break from a quick release of the next? What type of expansion &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; are you planning for when the time comes to introduce a new one?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Rashere&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; While we haven't discussed time frames for the&amp;nbsp;next expansion yet, we did give out some details at the recent &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; Fan Faire.&amp;nbsp; The next expansion is a big one.&amp;nbsp; It's going to&amp;nbsp;cover the entire level spread of the game, including a new &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; starting city and content that covers all levels of the game,&amp;nbsp;from the brand new player to the high end raider.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Fongwoo-Zek*&lt;/FONT&gt; Could you provide any insight&amp;nbsp; about the newbie armor quests on the progression server? Will &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; they be staying in as is? nerfed? disabled until a later date?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; This was mentioned in one of the threads on the&amp;nbsp;Progression Server board on the Eqforums and is on my list of &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; things to investigate. This is actually a problem for much more&amp;nbsp;than just the newbie quests, so it's something I'm going to &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; have to look at on a more global basis to make sure we're not&amp;nbsp;introducing gear (items, foods, money, experience, and many &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; other things, for that matter) that is far beyond the era&amp;nbsp;currently available on the server.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*dancia*&lt;/FONT&gt; why was the sky removed from&amp;nbsp;everfrost?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Rashere&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; The sky was accidentally turned on in a number&amp;nbsp;of older zones during one of the previous patches.&amp;nbsp; It was this &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; change that first enabled the sky in EverFrost and the sky was&amp;nbsp;removed when we fixed the problem so the zone should once again &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; look like it did before the error occurred.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Lyndro*&lt;/FONT&gt; Will magician pets be able to dual&amp;nbsp;wield on the progression server.&amp;nbsp; What about the speed cap on &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; necro pets?&amp;nbsp; What about things like innate crits for wizards,&amp;nbsp;will those exists on the progression server?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; In general, most current systems will remain on&amp;nbsp;the Progression server, which includes but is not limited to &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; those that you mentioned.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Aside from unlocking new expansions and&amp;nbsp;features, the progression server will be nearly identical to a &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; Live server.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; While I look back on the first few months of EQ&amp;nbsp;fondly, I'm not sure I'd want to go back to the days of 1 point &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; backstabs, spell books, or meditate buttons.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*taliefer*&lt;/FONT&gt; are is there any chance beastlords&amp;nbsp;and berserkers will be allowed from the start on the &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; progression server?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Vahlar&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Like the races that will be unlocked by&amp;nbsp;expansion progression, the same will go for the different &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; classes. Basically, if the content or expansion you're playing&amp;nbsp;through didn't have one of the races, classes, or features you &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; mentioned, it won't be available.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*krimz-afk*&lt;/FONT&gt; what will be required as the&amp;nbsp;"twists" or an example of to unlock an expansion other than &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; just killing the main boss of that expansion&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; We are not really limited as to the&amp;nbsp;requirements for opening up content on the Progression Server &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; -- We have everything from raid-target kills to quest&amp;nbsp;completion to discovery to guild-based accomplishments are at &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; our fingertips as tools for expansion progression. That's not&amp;nbsp;to say we're going to use all or even any of those, but it &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; gives you an idea as to what we have available. Anything's&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*jimjohnson*&lt;/FONT&gt; Just to clear idea with the new&amp;nbsp;progression server, nothing will be instanced untill LdoN/Plane &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; of Time?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; The instanced content in the old world (such as&amp;nbsp;monster missions, for example) won't unlock until the expansion &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; that is associated with them is opened.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; So, correct.&amp;nbsp; No instanced content should be&amp;nbsp;available until LDoN / PoTime.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Chanaluss*&lt;/FONT&gt; recently the magician fire pet was&amp;nbsp;adjusted to not snare, root, and annul. are there any other &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; plans at this time to adjust them to be more useful for&amp;nbsp;magicians?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Rytan gets credit for changing the fire pets to&amp;nbsp;use spell lists, to explicitly specify what they should and &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; shouldn't use in combat.&amp;nbsp; If after this fix, the pets are still&amp;nbsp;out of balance and some are more useful than others I can take &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; a look at them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Shmeeve*&lt;/FONT&gt; Recently Nodyin made a post on the&amp;nbsp;official EverQuest forums, mentioning a set of notes being &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; worked on, to provide players with more information regarding&amp;nbsp;the profression server.&amp;nbsp; Can we get any further information as &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; to when these notes will be made public?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; The notes that Nodyin mentioned is the&amp;nbsp;press-release regarding the server, which is currently being &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; worked on. We're also still working on some of&amp;nbsp; the details of&amp;nbsp;how all of the intricate pieces of this server will work and &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; formulating plans to handle all of the issues that we encounter&amp;nbsp;(and that players have voiced concerns over). Once we have &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; everything in a more solid state, we'll be answering questions&amp;nbsp;and making posts on the Progressio&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; Once we have everything in a more solid state,&amp;nbsp;we'll be answering questions and making posts on the &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; Progression Server forum. As a side note, we do plan on having&amp;nbsp;a beta-cycle for this server, so you will get a chance to help &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; form the server and discover additional problems prior to the&amp;nbsp;launch.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*oiingo*&lt;/FONT&gt; As Maddoc stated the Sullon Zek event&amp;nbsp;is now fixed and live, that naturally means more guilds will &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; progress through events and into Deathknell once the instance&amp;nbsp;servers are fixed.&amp;nbsp; Has any progress been made on the Ayonae Ro &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; script to help bring the encounter into a potentially winnable&amp;nbsp;form?&amp;nbsp; It's a lot of fun, but I really want to see further &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; inside the bell tower.&amp;nbsp; 8)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Thanks, oiingo, I'm glad you're enjoying the&amp;nbsp;bell tower raids so far. =)&amp;nbsp; I'm getting feedback from raiders &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; indicating that the second phase of the first event, where the&amp;nbsp;Deathknell Enforcers attack, is simply impossible.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; To scale back the difficulty of that fight,&amp;nbsp;I've removed the Enforcer's ability to shrug off a tank and &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; select a new target.&amp;nbsp; Since there are 4 of them, and they tend&amp;nbsp;to use this ability at the same time, it can wreak havoc on &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; raids that aren't composed by inordinate number of plate tanks.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I hope to get this pushed out to Live servers&amp;nbsp;soon, and that it makes the event very hard, but doable.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Igorath*&lt;/FONT&gt; Whats the possibility of letting&amp;nbsp;non-subscribing posting on the forums, after a mod review the&amp;nbsp;post?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Kytherea&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; While I would love to open the forums to&amp;nbsp;anyone whether they subscribe or not, we just don't have the &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; man power available to approve posts of non-subscribers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Non-subscribers can certainly read the boards though.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Loral*&lt;/FONT&gt; While Arcstone has proven very&amp;nbsp;successful for pickup-groups, the other zones in Prophecy seem &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; to see little use. Is this true and if so, will anything be&amp;nbsp;done to make these zones more attractive?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Oshran&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We're constantly reevaluating underused content&amp;nbsp;via player feedback on the forums. While no specific overhaul &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; is planned for PoR, I can say expect to see more Arcstone-like&amp;nbsp;content for single groupers in the near future.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*jimjohnson*&lt;/FONT&gt; Veteran rewards will be locked&amp;nbsp;out untill later expansions then?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Vahlar&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We're looking at all the technical aspects of&amp;nbsp;the Progression Server right now, but our plan is to withold &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; the veteran AAs until the Progression server has essentially&amp;nbsp;"caught up" to the Live servers.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Raisty_*&lt;/FONT&gt; On the progression server are the&amp;nbsp;frogloks still going to be in rathe mountains on server opening &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; (not playable just there)? Also in rathe mountains are we going&amp;nbsp;to see a return of hillgiants?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; I have to look into at it more in depth, but&amp;nbsp;off the top of my head, the frogloks in Rathe Mountains will &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; not be there until Frogloks become a playable race -- On that&amp;nbsp;note, the hill giants are still in Rathe Mountains, they're &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; just moved somewhere else in the zone.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Kryai*&lt;/FONT&gt; Are expansions on the progressive&amp;nbsp;server able to be unlocked in anything other than the linear &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; order they came out? Example: LDoN before PoP etc..&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; We have the ability to open them up in any&amp;nbsp;order we choose. LdoN and LoY are the only ones that we've &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; really thought about opening up in a non-linear progression,&amp;nbsp;however... This is a progression server, so I would expect that &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; the expansions will be opened up in the order they were&amp;nbsp;released. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; As I mentioned before, some details are still&amp;nbsp;being worked out, so be sure to visit the progression server &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; forums on the Eqforums, since that's where I'll be&amp;nbsp;communicating with most of the players.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;&amp;nbsp;*ellandar*&lt;/FONT&gt; can you give us any ETA at all,&amp;nbsp;even a ballpark figure, of when the progression server will go &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; live?&amp;nbsp; are we talking a few months, end of summer 2006, winter&amp;nbsp;2006, etc?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Rashere&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We're expecting to launch the server within the&amp;nbsp;next few months.&amp;nbsp; We should have more details for you soon, &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; though, which will narrow that down.&amp;nbsp; Keep an eye on the&amp;nbsp;EverQuest website for more details.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;&amp;nbsp;*krimz-afk*&lt;/FONT&gt; I'd like to suggest re&amp;nbsp;implimenting the best of the best and test of tacticts&amp;nbsp;tournaments these were widely loved events that brought &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; together the eq community and should be considered. Thoughts?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Kytherea&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Best of the Best events certainly are fun! The&amp;nbsp;guides are responsible for most of the events run on the &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; servers these days.&amp;nbsp; If you have a request for a particular&amp;nbsp;type of event I suggest contacting a guide who is online to &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; make the request or if you prefer you can PM me or&amp;nbsp;Naylie-Delanews or Pex on the EQ forums with your suggestions.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Dreaddor*&lt;/FONT&gt; Will people be able to farm epic&amp;nbsp;items from old world before Kunark is even unlocked on the &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; progression server?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Rashere&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; In most cases, content will be remaining as it&amp;nbsp;is for the progression server.&amp;nbsp; In the case of the epics, if &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; there are old world pieces you can farm before Kunark opens,&amp;nbsp;then you'll be able to get them before that expansion is opened &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; up.&amp;nbsp; You just won't be able to complete the epic since they&amp;nbsp;generally require Kunark specific content at some point in the &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; quest.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*taliefer*&lt;/FONT&gt; so are you going to revert rathe&amp;nbsp;mountains to the pre-froglok files? and remove all &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; bst/berserker guildmasters and npcs, and items from the old&amp;nbsp;world, up untill those specific expansions?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; As Rashere just mentioned, we're going to keep&amp;nbsp;most of the content remaining the same as it is on the Live &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; Servers -- Rathe Mountains is a special case, since those NPC's&amp;nbsp;shouldn't really be there in the "Progression" until the LoY &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; storyline has been opened. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; In short, it's very likely that the frogs will&amp;nbsp;not be up in Rathe Mountains and that Rathe Mountains will &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; exist as it was prior to the frogloks moving in.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Wycca*&lt;/FONT&gt; What is the current status of&amp;nbsp;reviewing auras' usefulness, and on fixing the many bugs&amp;nbsp;surrounding them?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I still need to review all the traps and auras&amp;nbsp;available from Prophecy of Ro and evaluate if they need to be &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; tweaked at all.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; In addition to that, we do need to address a&amp;nbsp;handful of bugs with them, mostly concerning stacking.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Rocax*&lt;/FONT&gt; When the progression server comes to&amp;nbsp;an expansion you may not own, will you need to purchase it to &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; play that expansion?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; The Progression Server follows all of the same&amp;nbsp;rules as the normal servers -- If an expansion is open and you &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; don't own it, you won't be able to go there.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Vahlar&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Progression server will give DING a whole new&amp;nbsp;meaning.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Chanaluss*&lt;/FONT&gt; are there currently any plans to&amp;nbsp;add on to the guild hall? like for example, a dueling npc?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Oshran&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We have no specific plans to change the&amp;nbsp;guildhall NPC roster right now, but good ideas for it do come &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; up from time to time.&amp;nbsp; At the very least, expect some new gnome&amp;nbsp;ports to Arcstone and Devastation with the next patch. &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff9900&gt;&amp;lt;Calelena&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; That will wrap it up for tonight. I'd like to&amp;nbsp; thank the developers for coming!

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff9900&gt;&amp;lt;Calelena&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Welcome to another great Stratics house of&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; commons with the developers of EverQuest! Tonight's topic is &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; General Topic. So please keep your questions to this topic. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Kytherea&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Good evening everyone!&amp;nbsp; I am Christina Delzer&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; the Community Relations Manager for EverQuest.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Rashere&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Good evening everyone.&amp;nbsp; I'm Travis McGeathy,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lead Designer for EverQuest.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Vahlar&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Hi, I'm Holly Longdale. Assistant Lead Designer&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;on EQ!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; Thanks for coming everyone, I'm Jason Mash&amp;nbsp; (Maddoc) and am an Assistant Lead Designer on the EQ team.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Ngreth&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Hello, I am Ngreth Thergn, Game Designer&amp;nbsp; specializing in tradeskills.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Hello all.&amp;nbsp; I'm Jonathan Caraker, or "Prathun",&amp;nbsp; the spells designer for EverQuest.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Oshran&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Hello everyone.&amp;nbsp; I'm Kevin Carter (Oshran), Game&amp;nbsp; Designer for EverQuest.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*jimjohnson*&lt;/FONT&gt; What is the status of the&amp;nbsp; progression server?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; I've been reading up on all of the threads on&amp;nbsp; the Progression Server forum on the eqforums, getting familiar &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; with what you guys see as the problems and coming up with&amp;nbsp; solutions to most of them. I've got some documentation and &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; notes on what needs to be taken care of. We've also got the&amp;nbsp; hardware up and running, so I should be able to start any &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; implementation that needs to be done starting Monday.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Shmeeve*&lt;/FONT&gt; With the planned removal of the&amp;nbsp; tutorial for the recently announced progression server, what &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; strategies are being considered to deal with congestion in the&amp;nbsp; classic Everquest 'newbie' zones?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; It's interesting that you mentioned that&amp;nbsp; because we were just discussing that very subject in my office &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; prior to the chat. We're still discussing options on that&amp;nbsp;subject, but I can say for sure that we are aware of it and &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; will make some adjustments to ease the congestion as much as&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Croix_FV*&lt;/FONT&gt; Rangers and Zerkers were recently&amp;nbsp;given a mitigation increase to fix balance issues amongst &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; non-tanks. What is being done to ensure that mitigation/avoidance balance issues are avoided amongst non-tanks, and between &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; tanks and non-tanks.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Rashere&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; The changes to mitigation for those two classes&amp;nbsp;was to give them a bit of a boost over tanks who simply &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; shouldn't have the same mitigation, but did previously.&amp;nbsp; It was&amp;nbsp;more of a fix than anything else.&amp;nbsp; We're keeping an eye on the &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; effects, though, and will make adjustments if it is warranted.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Croix_FV*&lt;/FONT&gt; Will Knights be receiving upgrades&amp;nbsp;to their respective aggro lines in order to stay with the &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; increasing aggro generation by DPS/Debuff classes?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Aggro generation was a hot topic at Fan Faire,&amp;nbsp;both for those classes who wanted it... and those who didn't &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; particularly like being attacked.&amp;nbsp; I'll be evaluating aggro&amp;nbsp;across the board before making any firm decisions, but there's &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; a very good chance that knights will receive abilities in the&amp;nbsp;future that help in keeping casters and debuffers off the top &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; of the hatelist.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Chanaluss*&lt;/FONT&gt; With the announcement of the&amp;nbsp;Progressive server, many people have been wondering about the &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; fate of the Guktans. since many LoY features are very useful&amp;nbsp;for the entire server, will there be a chance of the guktans &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; going live on the progressive server before LoY zones are&amp;nbsp;launched?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Vahlar&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; The fate of many races are determined by the&amp;nbsp;players' actions on the progression server.&amp;nbsp; The Iksar, &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; Guktans, and Vah Shir will all remain under lock and key (or&amp;nbsp;continent) until those expansions are unlocked. The same will &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; occur with the features available with each expansion. &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Croix_FV*&lt;/FONT&gt; What is the current status of&amp;nbsp;Sullon Zek in Deathknell and is there an ETA on a fix?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; I presume you're talking about Sullon Zek in&amp;nbsp;Razorthorn and the zone-crash related to her event -- This &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; crash was located late in the afternoon yesterday and, while we&amp;nbsp;did fix it last night, it was too late to push the fix to all &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; live servers. We pushed the fix to our internal test servers&amp;nbsp;and had our QA team verify the fix first thing this morning and &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; then had the fix pushed out to all live servers shortly&amp;nbsp;thereafter. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; The fix should currently be live. Also, another&amp;nbsp;concern about the zone that was brought up was the NPC's in the &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; zone that seemed to have no mana, even though they can cast&amp;nbsp;spells. This fix should also be live.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Sullon Zek would like to note that she lives in&amp;nbsp;Razorthorn, not Deathknell.&lt;BR&gt;* Prathun teases Croix_FV.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Kard*&lt;/FONT&gt; Is there an eta yet on the progression&amp;nbsp;server? Or even an eta of when an eta will be announced? Also &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; as all servers are named after something in the game I suggest&amp;nbsp;the new server is called Lord Doljonijiarnimorinar or just &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; Doljonijiarnimorinar&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Rashere&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Right now, we're in the planning phase for the&amp;nbsp;expansion.&amp;nbsp; We're hammering out the details and figuring out &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; exactly what needs to be done.&amp;nbsp; Once that's done, we'll have a&amp;nbsp;better grasp on when the server will be available and there &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; will be more official press announcements with those details.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Rashere&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; expansion = server&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Wycca*&lt;/FONT&gt; Greetings, any chance you could remove&amp;nbsp;the monk weight penalty? It's sort of outdated in todays game &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; and serves no real fuction besides providing itemiztaion&amp;nbsp;problems and annoyance!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Rashere&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; The monk weight penalty is simply a part of the&amp;nbsp;class.&amp;nbsp; Every class has its quirks and having to manage your &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; weight is part of being a monk.&amp;nbsp; We don't have plans to remove&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Nedrom*&lt;/FONT&gt; When can we expect a fix for the many&amp;nbsp;problems encountered when charmed by an NPC?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; I've received a decent amount of information&amp;nbsp;from the players on the problems that they've been having with &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; Charm in general, especially when it's used in higher end&amp;nbsp;events and encounters. Our QA has verified a good portion of &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; them and issue-tickets have been created on everything they've&amp;nbsp;found and assigned to the programmer&amp;nbsp; team. I know that they've &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; fixed at least one this week, so they are being looked into and&amp;nbsp;worked on.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Cinexa*&lt;/FONT&gt; Hi guys! Hope everyone's hard at work&amp;nbsp;on the next expansion!&amp;nbsp; Any idea when Deathknell will get a &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; look see ~ word is it's mostly impossible atm bringing back&amp;nbsp;visions of uqua, tacvi, etc...any info on this?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Feedback from players currently raiding in&amp;nbsp;Deathknell has indicated that fighting the equivalent of four &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; Zi-thuuli's simultaneously is, at best, a logistical nightmare.&amp;nbsp; I've removed the stun and blur ability from the Deathknell &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; Enforcer gargoyles on Test and will try to get this pushed out&amp;nbsp;to Live as soon as possible.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Tranlin*&lt;/FONT&gt; While I don't speak for everyone,&amp;nbsp;With the large number of sucessive expansions released I feel &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; like I can not keep up with all the new content. My guild isn't&amp;nbsp;super hardcore but we are fairly high end. I think that EQ most &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; certainly needs a breather from quick expansions, will there a&amp;nbsp;break from a quick release of the next? What type of expansion &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; are you planning for when the time comes to introduce a new one?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Rashere&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; While we haven't discussed time frames for the&amp;nbsp;next expansion yet, we did give out some details at the recent &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; Fan Faire.&amp;nbsp; The next expansion is a big one.&amp;nbsp; It's going to&amp;nbsp;cover the entire level spread of the game, including a new &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; starting city and content that covers all levels of the game,&amp;nbsp;from the brand new player to the high end raider.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Fongwoo-Zek*&lt;/FONT&gt; Could you provide any insight&amp;nbsp; about the newbie armor quests on the progression server? Will &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; they be staying in as is? nerfed? disabled until a later date?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; This was mentioned in one of the threads on the&amp;nbsp;Progression Server board on the Eqforums and is on my list of &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; things to investigate. This is actually a problem for much more&amp;nbsp;than just the newbie quests, so it's something I'm going to &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; have to look at on a more global basis to make sure we're not&amp;nbsp;introducing gear (items, foods, money, experience, and many &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; other things, for that matter) that is far beyond the era&amp;nbsp;currently available on the server.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*dancia*&lt;/FONT&gt; why was the sky removed from&amp;nbsp;everfrost?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Rashere&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; The sky was accidentally turned on in a number&amp;nbsp;of older zones during one of the previous patches.&amp;nbsp; It was this &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; change that first enabled the sky in EverFrost and the sky was&amp;nbsp;removed when we fixed the problem so the zone should once again &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; look like it did before the error occurred.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Lyndro*&lt;/FONT&gt; Will magician pets be able to dual&amp;nbsp;wield on the progression server.&amp;nbsp; What about the speed cap on &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; necro pets?&amp;nbsp; What about things like innate crits for wizards,&amp;nbsp;will those exists on the progression server?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; In general, most current systems will remain on&amp;nbsp;the Progression server, which includes but is not limited to &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; those that you mentioned.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Aside from unlocking new expansions and&amp;nbsp;features, the progression server will be nearly identical to a &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; Live server.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; While I look back on the first few months of EQ&amp;nbsp;fondly, I'm not sure I'd want to go back to the days of 1 point &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; backstabs, spell books, or meditate buttons.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*taliefer*&lt;/FONT&gt; are is there any chance beastlords&amp;nbsp;and berserkers will be allowed from the start on the &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; progression server?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Vahlar&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Like the races that will be unlocked by&amp;nbsp;expansion progression, the same will go for the different &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; classes. Basically, if the content or expansion you're playing&amp;nbsp;through didn't have one of the races, classes, or features you &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; mentioned, it won't be available.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*krimz-afk*&lt;/FONT&gt; what will be required as the&amp;nbsp;"twists" or an example of to unlock an expansion other than &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; just killing the main boss of that expansion&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; We are not really limited as to the&amp;nbsp;requirements for opening up content on the Progression Server &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; -- We have everything from raid-target kills to quest&amp;nbsp;completion to discovery to guild-based accomplishments are at &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; our fingertips as tools for expansion progression. That's not&amp;nbsp;to say we're going to use all or even any of those, but it &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; gives you an idea as to what we have available. Anything's&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*jimjohnson*&lt;/FONT&gt; Just to clear idea with the new&amp;nbsp;progression server, nothing will be instanced untill LdoN/Plane &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; of Time?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; The instanced content in the old world (such as&amp;nbsp;monster missions, for example) won't unlock until the expansion &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; that is associated with them is opened.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; So, correct.&amp;nbsp; No instanced content should be&amp;nbsp;available until LDoN / PoTime.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Chanaluss*&lt;/FONT&gt; recently the magician fire pet was&amp;nbsp;adjusted to not snare, root, and annul. are there any other &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; plans at this time to adjust them to be more useful for&amp;nbsp;magicians?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Rytan gets credit for changing the fire pets to&amp;nbsp;use spell lists, to explicitly specify what they should and &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; shouldn't use in combat.&amp;nbsp; If after this fix, the pets are still&amp;nbsp;out of balance and some are more useful than others I can take &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; a look at them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Shmeeve*&lt;/FONT&gt; Recently Nodyin made a post on the&amp;nbsp;official EverQuest forums, mentioning a set of notes being &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; worked on, to provide players with more information regarding&amp;nbsp;the profression server.&amp;nbsp; Can we get any further information as &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; to when these notes will be made public?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; The notes that Nodyin mentioned is the&amp;nbsp;press-release regarding the server, which is currently being &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; worked on. We're also still working on some of&amp;nbsp; the details of&amp;nbsp;how all of the intricate pieces of this server will work and &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; formulating plans to handle all of the issues that we encounter&amp;nbsp;(and that players have voiced concerns over). Once we have &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; everything in a more solid state, we'll be answering questions&amp;nbsp;and making posts on the Progressio&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; Once we have everything in a more solid state,&amp;nbsp;we'll be answering questions and making posts on the &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; Progression Server forum. As a side note, we do plan on having&amp;nbsp;a beta-cycle for this server, so you will get a chance to help &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; form the server and discover additional problems prior to the&amp;nbsp;launch.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*oiingo*&lt;/FONT&gt; As Maddoc stated the Sullon Zek event&amp;nbsp;is now fixed and live, that naturally means more guilds will &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; progress through events and into Deathknell once the instance&amp;nbsp;servers are fixed.&amp;nbsp; Has any progress been made on the Ayonae Ro &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; script to help bring the encounter into a potentially winnable&amp;nbsp;form?&amp;nbsp; It's a lot of fun, but I really want to see further &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; inside the bell tower.&amp;nbsp; 8)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Thanks, oiingo, I'm glad you're enjoying the&amp;nbsp;bell tower raids so far. =)&amp;nbsp; I'm getting feedback from raiders &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; indicating that the second phase of the first event, where the&amp;nbsp;Deathknell Enforcers attack, is simply impossible.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; To scale back the difficulty of that fight,&amp;nbsp;I've removed the Enforcer's ability to shrug off a tank and &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; select a new target.&amp;nbsp; Since there are 4 of them, and they tend&amp;nbsp;to use this ability at the same time, it can wreak havoc on &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; raids that aren't composed by inordinate number of plate tanks.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I hope to get this pushed out to Live servers&amp;nbsp;soon, and that it makes the event very hard, but doable.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Igorath*&lt;/FONT&gt; Whats the possibility of letting&amp;nbsp;non-subscribing posting on the forums, after a mod review the&amp;nbsp;post?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Kytherea&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; While I would love to open the forums to&amp;nbsp;anyone whether they subscribe or not, we just don't have the &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; man power available to approve posts of non-subscribers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Non-subscribers can certainly read the boards though.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Loral*&lt;/FONT&gt; While Arcstone has proven very&amp;nbsp;successful for pickup-groups, the other zones in Prophecy seem &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; to see little use. Is this true and if so, will anything be&amp;nbsp;done to make these zones more attractive?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Oshran&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We're constantly reevaluating underused content&amp;nbsp;via player feedback on the forums. While no specific overhaul &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; is planned for PoR, I can say expect to see more Arcstone-like&amp;nbsp;content for single groupers in the near future.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*jimjohnson*&lt;/FONT&gt; Veteran rewards will be locked&amp;nbsp;out untill later expansions then?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Vahlar&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We're looking at all the technical aspects of&amp;nbsp;the Progression Server right now, but our plan is to withold &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; the veteran AAs until the Progression server has essentially&amp;nbsp;"caught up" to the Live servers.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Raisty_*&lt;/FONT&gt; On the progression server are the&amp;nbsp;frogloks still going to be in rathe mountains on server opening &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; (not playable just there)? Also in rathe mountains are we going&amp;nbsp;to see a return of hillgiants?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; I have to look into at it more in depth, but&amp;nbsp;off the top of my head, the frogloks in Rathe Mountains will &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; not be there until Frogloks become a playable race -- On that&amp;nbsp;note, the hill giants are still in Rathe Mountains, they're &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; just moved somewhere else in the zone.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Kryai*&lt;/FONT&gt; Are expansions on the progressive&amp;nbsp;server able to be unlocked in anything other than the linear &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; order they came out? Example: LDoN before PoP etc..&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; We have the ability to open them up in any&amp;nbsp;order we choose. LdoN and LoY are the only ones that we've &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; really thought about opening up in a non-linear progression,&amp;nbsp;however... This is a progression server, so I would expect that &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; the expansions will be opened up in the order they were&amp;nbsp;released. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; As I mentioned before, some details are still&amp;nbsp;being worked out, so be sure to visit the progression server &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; forums on the Eqforums, since that's where I'll be&amp;nbsp;communicating with most of the players.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;&amp;nbsp;*ellandar*&lt;/FONT&gt; can you give us any ETA at all,&amp;nbsp;even a ballpark figure, of when the progression server will go &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; live?&amp;nbsp; are we talking a few months, end of summer 2006, winter&amp;nbsp;2006, etc?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Rashere&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We're expecting to launch the server within the&amp;nbsp;next few months.&amp;nbsp; We should have more details for you soon, &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; though, which will narrow that down.&amp;nbsp; Keep an eye on the&amp;nbsp;EverQuest website for more details.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;&amp;nbsp;*krimz-afk*&lt;/FONT&gt; I'd like to suggest re&amp;nbsp;implimenting the best of the best and test of tacticts&amp;nbsp;tournaments these were widely loved events that brought &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; together the eq community and should be considered. Thoughts?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Kytherea&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Best of the Best events certainly are fun! The&amp;nbsp;guides are responsible for most of the events run on the &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; servers these days.&amp;nbsp; If you have a request for a particular&amp;nbsp;type of event I suggest contacting a guide who is online to &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; make the request or if you prefer you can PM me or&amp;nbsp;Naylie-Delanews or Pex on the EQ forums with your suggestions.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Dreaddor*&lt;/FONT&gt; Will people be able to farm epic&amp;nbsp;items from old world before Kunark is even unlocked on the &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; progression server?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Rashere&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; In most cases, content will be remaining as it&amp;nbsp;is for the progression server.&amp;nbsp; In the case of the epics, if &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; there are old world pieces you can farm before Kunark opens,&amp;nbsp;then you'll be able to get them before that expansion is opened &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; up.&amp;nbsp; You just won't be able to complete the epic since they&amp;nbsp;generally require Kunark specific content at some point in the &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; quest.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*taliefer*&lt;/FONT&gt; so are you going to revert rathe&amp;nbsp;mountains to the pre-froglok files? and remove all &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; bst/berserker guildmasters and npcs, and items from the old&amp;nbsp;world, up untill those specific expansions?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; As Rashere just mentioned, we're going to keep&amp;nbsp;most of the content remaining the same as it is on the Live &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; Servers -- Rathe Mountains is a special case, since those NPC's&amp;nbsp;shouldn't really be there in the "Progression" until the LoY &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; storyline has been opened. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; In short, it's very likely that the frogs will&amp;nbsp;not be up in Rathe Mountains and that Rathe Mountains will &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; exist as it was prior to the frogloks moving in.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Wycca*&lt;/FONT&gt; What is the current status of&amp;nbsp;reviewing auras' usefulness, and on fixing the many bugs&amp;nbsp;surrounding them?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; I still need to review all the traps and auras&amp;nbsp;available from Prophecy of Ro and evaluate if they need to be &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; tweaked at all.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Prathun&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; In addition to that, we do need to address a&amp;nbsp;handful of bugs with them, mostly concerning stacking.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Rocax*&lt;/FONT&gt; When the progression server comes to&amp;nbsp;an expansion you may not own, will you need to purchase it to &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; play that expansion?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Maddoc&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp; The Progression Server follows all of the same&amp;nbsp;rules as the normal servers -- If an expansion is open and you &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; don't own it, you won't be able to go there.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Vahlar&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; Progression server will give DING a whole new&amp;nbsp;meaning.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;*Chanaluss*&lt;/FONT&gt; are there currently any plans to&amp;nbsp;add on to the guild hall? like for example, a dueling npc?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66ff00&gt;&amp;lt;Oshran&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; We have no specific plans to change the&amp;nbsp;guildhall NPC roster right now, but good ideas for it do come &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; up from time to time.&amp;nbsp; At the very least, expect some new gnome&amp;nbsp;ports to Arcstone and Devastation with the next patch. &lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff9900&gt;&amp;lt;Calelena&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; That will wrap it up for tonight. I'd like to&amp;nbsp; thank the developers for coming!
