<DIV>Here is a sample of a rewrite of The Night Before Christmas I did last year to give you an idea of what we are looking for with this challenge:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Twas the morning of Christmas, when all through the land<BR>Not an adventurer was stirring, except the bard and his band, </DIV>
<DIV><BR>All weapons and armor were oiled and stored, <BR>And each of them sat near a fire that roared.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The druid and shaman were snuggled up with their pets, <BR>While the ranger and paladin made friendly bets. <BR></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The necro and wizard shared stories of fame, <BR>As the rogue and magician had discussions quite tame...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>When outside of the guildhall came a thunderous noise, <BR>causing the enchanter and cleric to lose all their poise.</DIV>
<DIV><BR>Away to the doors the monk and warrior did dash, <BR>As the berserker quickly hefted his axe in a flash. <BR></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The shadowknight's sword took on a dull glow, <BR>And the beastlord's warder started to grow.</DIV>
<DIV><BR>In the light of Luclin, a small figure did soar, <BR>Through the Plane of Knowledge, astride a hamster of war. <BR></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The miniature form, so lively and quick, <BR>Arrived at the door in merely a tick.</DIV>
<DIV><BR>She was dressed in red leather, except her head, hands and feet, <BR>And worn on her face was a smile quite sweet.</DIV>
<DIV><BR>One of her hands held a cookie filled plate, <BR>And she asked very softly, "oh dear am I late?". <BR></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>With a sigh she exclaimed, "I hope you all have been good!" <BR>As she sniffed at a pitcher she held made of wood.</DIV>
<DIV><BR>Her eyes -- how they sparkled â€“ like the stars in the sky! <BR>Her cheeks nice and rosy like a fresh cherry pie! <BR></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>A smile spread across her small ruby lips, <BR>The hair on her feet held in crystalline clips.</DIV>
<DIV><BR>Her war hamster steed was hairless and mellow, <BR>But somehow it seemed to quite suit the fellow.</DIV>
<DIV><BR>She entered the hall and went straight to the fire, <BR>The scent of warm cookies filling all with desire.</DIV>
<DIV><BR>Each adventurer followed the warm cookie smell, <BR>Soon 'round the fire did everyone dwell. <BR></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>She gave each one a sweet cookie treat<BR>And after pouring the milk, bade them to eat.</DIV>
<DIV><BR>A right pleasant time everyone had, <BR>Soon realizing that they all were quite glad, <BR></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>That on one day a year they put aside greed, <BR>and the thirst for battle which they often felt need.</DIV>
<DIV><BR>With each class of explorer her time she did spend, <BR>At least a few moments to each did she tend. <BR></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>When nothing but crumbs remained on the plate, <BR>She happily said, "This has been great!"</DIV>
<DIV><BR>She sprang to her stead, gave all a bright smile, <BR>Then away they both scampered in best Halfling style.</DIV>
<DIV><BR>Ky proclaimed as her hamster ran quickly away, <BR>"Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good-day!"</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
				
							<p>Kytherea ~~fear the Halfling that wields a giant hammer & is accompanied by a hairless War Hamster~~<br><br>"We're off to bash the {insert character class here}"
