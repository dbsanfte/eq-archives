    <description>&lt;div&gt;Whether or not this was its intended purpose, this folder has become a focal point for a tremendous amount of negative criticism aimed at SOE. The community on the servers seems far nicer than the community that hangs out here constantly grousing about what is right/wrong/whatever with EQ.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Apparently, for the critics, SOE did (or didn't do) something each of you thought they should, and they are somehow ultimately to blame for your various forms of misery.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I beg to differ with you my fellow players.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is not SOE that is to blame for your problems with EQ. Each of you chooses to keep paying for access. By doing so, each of you is making a conscious decision to endorse &lt;strong&gt;everything&lt;/strong&gt; about EQ: the good, the bad, the ugly, and the indifferent.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So it really comes down to a choice: If whatever problems you have with the game are such that it is no longer fun, and you no longer wish to lend any sort of endorsement to the product: end your patronage, sever ties, delete your account, uninstall the program, find another game to play.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Should you choose to remain, you are accepting the fact that you will not always be pleased by the changes SOE chooses to make to EQ, but overall, you believe that the experience of playing EQ is still enjoyable enough for you to to continue to give it your time, effort, and money.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our time here would be better spent discussing what we love about the game and ways to enjoy playing it, as well as, providing &lt;em&gt;constructive criticism &lt;/em&gt;that helps make the game more enjoyable for everyone.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Yes, SOE needs feedback from the player community. Yes player feedback is important, if properly used.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The player community also needs feedback. SOE's ability in this area is (to be polite) lacking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Akinit wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;You are quite right actually.  Many people **SMURF** cause they want things, especially clerics, rangers,shaman, druids and any others I have happened to miss.  SoE tends to cater to the biggest crybabies on these boards.  Some examples would include ranger autofire, dodh single group mission loot changes, druid group heals, the insanely uber abilities of clerics that they constantly improve upon, i can go on and on. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So basically i guess the reason so many **SMURF** here is because soe actually listens if they say it enough.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Tranceman wrote:&lt;br&gt;Absolutely in agreement. I would still however like for SoE to respond publically&lt;br&gt;at some point about why they utterly refuse to give progress reports on changes&lt;br&gt;that were  promised years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I also wish I could see this before my account expired, but if past performance&lt;br&gt; is anything to go by, this simply won't happen. When you don't care about your&lt;br&gt;work, or your customers, there's no need to explain yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are two basic examples from this thread as to what happens because feedback FROM SOE is inadequate. One response displays hostility. The other response displays a fading hope. Why? Why should one person become hostile and the other be losing hope?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take a look at the class issues lists. There has not been any real activity (on SOE's part) since April of last year. NONE of them have even been updated for two and a half months. NOT EVEN A &amp;quot;No update for &amp;lt;insert month&amp;gt;&amp;quot;. Not on any of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now it can be argued that SOE has been really busy with the PoR beta and rollout along with the anniversery activities, and this would be true. I know the Dev's were very busy during this time because I was a small part of the beta. I know how active the beta boards were. There is also a community correspondents board (that I personally don't have access to) that seems to get some activity. Be that as it may, the general player population does not have access to those boards. What the general population can see is total inactivity pertaining to their concerns. What they see is that nothing has been addressed in almost a year. What they see is not a single employee at SOE could skip one trip to the coffee urn and cut and paste a &amp;quot;I am sorry but I have no update for you this month&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now whether SOE realizes it or not, total silence is a form of feedback. A very negative form of feedback. Each individual will interpret silence in their own way. Some will believe it is a personal dislike for them or their class. Some will believe that SOE doesn't care. Some will believe that SOE thinks that their concerns are too trivial to bother with. Some will believe that their concerns are not even being reviewed by SOE employees. No matter what they believe continued silence will only reinforce their belief. This continued negative feedback at best will engender suspicion of SOE's motives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for the in-game feedback command? Why should that work any better than these boards?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do hate to say it but the latest episode involving the AOL conection issue from the uK does typify the &lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;percieved &lt;/font&gt;level of service. IF anyone reading this is unaware then go read all the different threads in the tech support forum. The main bone of contention is the &lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;percieved&lt;/font&gt; abrogation of responsibility for the customer base from SOE tech reps. Earlier today it was announced that SOE would contact AOl to try to help resolve the situation. The tone on those threads have now calmed down and people are being patient. Unfortunately we, the paying customers, have been asking SOE to do this for 2 days and only received a &amp;quot;wont do&amp;quot; responce. Not a &amp;quot;cant do&amp;quot; but a &amp;quot;Wont do&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason I have highlighted Percieved twice above is to draw attention to the fact that whilst SOE techs may have been working overtime trying to resolve the issues the simple fact that they wouldnt admit to what they were doing created a lot of anger, frustration and bad feeling towards them. Now they have said they have done what was requested days ago (regardless of if it acheives anything) they have shown they are interested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What comes out here is that managing customer expectation is a matter of perception. Keep customers informed with honest, up to date and accurate information and they will stay on side. Fail to do this and they will turn away. That is simply good busines practise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for those who on here want all us moaners to quite EQ I ask this. How long would EQ last if ,the unknown numbers who are fed up waiting forever for things, did leave. Do you want the number of servers halved again and again until the game became economically unviable??&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starsabre,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I obviously disagree with making a choice in the context of your comments. What many people fail to take into account is the amount of time and money invested in this game when amking statements that alleviate SoE's responsibilty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the opportunity cost that has been spent already that makes me furious with the lack of professionalism on SoE's part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What confounds me even more is people protecting that behavior by saying leave the game or its part of the game. Neither makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaving the game means to give in to poor business behavior. Saying its part of the game is even more defeatist. If we really had this mentality no one would get flagged and just say, oh well its too difficult so why try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoE has an obligation to its paying customers to deliver. Instead of telling people if they don't like it to leave you should be supporting them in their quest for better performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lets say you own a subscription to XM radio. You have invested money in the installation of the radio and paid for your subscription for the next year. It works 99.9% of the time and most of the music content that you want is there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly they add new channels and all the one's you like don't work anymore what would you do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask for a rebate? Ask for satisfaction, Want Your questions answered in a timely manner? All of the above?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guess what I have worked at XM and their server systems are just as sophisticated if not more than EQ and if they go down they are switched to back ups immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Because they value their reputation and their customers. Most businesses at Sony's level operate this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like the content on EQ just as I like the content on XM, but even after working there if they made the same mistakes that SoE makes, a lot of people would be getting refunds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So again explain why it's ok for SoE to have sub-standard behavior?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ruleras,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I have made no statements alleviating SOE of anything, rather, I am reminding each and every paying customer that they also must bear the responsibility for what they have wrought.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What drives companies to make products, goods, and services? Profits. Where do they get their profits? From people like me and you. In all honesty, what do you think is going to be more effective at convincing them they need to make changes? Constant whining, or taking their profits away? I submit that it is the your continued choice to invest of your time and money, is what tells SOE they are doing more things right than they are things wrong.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Therefore I say to you again, if you truly find your enjoyment of the game has been so completely tainted by the problems you mentioned, why are you still putting your time and money into supporting something you don't believe in?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ya know what? The squeaky wheel gets the grease while the quiet wheel gets the shaft.  If you don't like rants and raves over problems others find with everquest ... don't read them.  Feedback works when SOE pays attention.  I say that to myself like a mantra because that is how it used to be.  If I saw an obvious no brainer way they could make EQ better I'd feedback ... and by god I was amazed how many suggestions were implemented ( no I know I'm sure not the only one who fedback those issues and I am not taking credit ) .... SO ... I will keep on squeaking when I see something that should be fixed ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIKE!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Fix level 70 LDONs so they aren't so difficult they aren't fun to play or make the experience worth the risk.  Those mobs hit like Riftseekers and xp like a spider in velks ... UNBALANCED!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Give clerics an invis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Remove the fail timer from MPG trials so people will try them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. While you are at it ... add some AC to the DODH gear that you made HP and MANA changes to so my warrior can wear it without losing AC.  The HP is great but come on ... War gear with 200 hp and 16 AC ... SIXTEEN!?  What a joke. It's pretty obvious someone dropped the ball for the melee rewards when they upgraded the hp and mana and left the AC at the stupid level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Add bracers to the game better than the DON bracers that are achievable without a guild or raid.  I don't care if it's hard but doing Tipt 10 times for the bracer to fall then losing to a cleric on the roll just plain sucks.  Same with the MPG trial.  The GM bracers for warriors stink unless you can put a bazu seal augment on them....and you need a guild for that.  Add quests or smithing recipes or something. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and KUDOS for the spirit cloak quest from Elijo in Arcstone ... THAT WAS AWESOME!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SQUEAK!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You are quite right actually.  Many people **SMURF** cause they want things, especially clerics, rangers,shaman, druids and any others I have happened to miss.  SoE tends to cater to the biggest crybabies on these boards.  Some examples would include ranger autofire, dodh single group mission loot changes, druid group heals, the insanely uber abilities of clerics that they constantly improve upon, i can go on and on. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So basically i guess the reason so many **SMURF** here is because soe actually listens if they say it enough.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;With a game this massive, they have to prioritize. &amp;quot;Game breakers&amp;quot; must come first. Everything else is gravy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Do you honestly think the devs don't want to fix things for you? They probably aren't given the time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Absolutely in agreement. I would still however like for SoE to respond publically&lt;br&gt;at some point about why they utterly refuse to give progress reports on changes&lt;br&gt;that were  promised years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also wish I could see this before my account expired, but if past performance&lt;br&gt; is anything to go by, this simply won't happen. When you don't care about your&lt;br&gt;work, or your customers, there's no need to explain yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
