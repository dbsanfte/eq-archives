    <description>Oh Thank you developer, I'm glad to see when I read this post, that you had a pink name =p.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And no, the speculation on the forums is small compared to how many people actually play on eqlive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>In game poll for progression server?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=947#M947</link>
      <description>Can we have an in game poll at the server selection about developer progression ideas such as time restrictions, flagging requirements, pvp, and etc.etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would greatly help the dev team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Or maybe these issues are already decided and all the discussions/threads about them are simply player speculation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's what I think, based on the posts from Devs so far:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;a) Time restrictions: nope.  Expansions will be unlocked by completing in-game events.  These events will include defeating the &amp;quot;end-game&amp;quot; encounters of a given expansion, and may also include an additional quest.  It is possible (but this is pure speculation) that the various &amp;quot;end-game&amp;quot; encounters will have to be beaten more than once, say, five times, before unlocking the next expansion, but as I state, that facet is speculative.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;b) Flagging Requirements: What flagging?  Expansions will be unlocked for the entire server at once.  Maybe you mean &amp;quot;unlocking requirements&amp;quot;, and I agree, this is still probably being discussed by the developers, since the few dev posts on the subject have stated that the exact requirements haven't been decided on.  They have stated it will likely involve defeating the end-game encounters for each expansion to unlock the next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;c) PVP: It'll be a blue server and have consensual PVP like any other blue server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;d) etc. etc. : The only open issues I am aware of are:&lt;br&gt; *) Which revamped zones will be reverted to old data sets, and which will not?  Dev posts on the subject have given some details.  Some zones will be reverted, others won't be.  Mostly, zones that have had their level requirements dramatically changed, or that used to be &amp;quot;end-game&amp;quot; zones for an expansion prior to revamping, will be reverted (ie: Veeshan's Peek has been specifically mentioned by a dev as a zone that will be reverted)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; *) Will the tutorial be active on this server, and what gear will it include?  Dev posts have stated that the tutorial be active on this server, but that certain drops (The Haste item and the Mana preservation item in particular) will be evaluated and possibly removed to help with balance.  There has been heated player discussion on this topic, with many forum posters asking for the tutorial to be removed, so maybe the devs will change their mind, but the current official word is that the tutorial will be active.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; *) Will Iksar, Beastlords, Vah Shir, Berserkers, Frogloks be playable on this server from day one?  No.  These classes and races are expansion perks and will be made available when their respective expansions have been unlocked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope that clears things up for a few folks :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Again I state it's not going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#000066"&gt;c) PVP: It'll be a blue server and have consensual PVP like any other blue server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;d) etc. etc. : The only open issues I am aware of are:&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt;*) Which revamped zones will be reverted to old data sets, and which will not?  Dev posts on the subject have given some details.  Some zones will be reverted, others won't be.  Mostly, zones that have had their level requirements dramatically changed, or that used to be &amp;quot;end-game&amp;quot; zones for an expansion prior to revamping, will be reverted (ie: Veeshan's Peek has been specifically mentioned by a dev as a zone that will be reverted)&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIRC Cazic was mentioned as well.  The only things that I feel need to be looked at are revamps including Lavastorm, which will prove unbalancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt; *) Will the tutorial be active on this server, and what gear will it include?  Dev posts have stated that the tutorial be active on this server, but that certain drops (The Haste item and the Mana preservation item in particular) will be evaluated and possibly removed to help with balance.  There has been heated player discussion on this topic, with many forum posters asking for the tutorial to be removed, so maybe the devs will change their mind, but the current official word is that the tutorial will be active.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extracting the tutorial completely would abolish any worries of balance issues.  If any tutorial needs to be instituted, I hope they will revert it to pre-DoD at least for a few weeks.  After that, the new tutorial would serve its intended purpose as well as allow new players a slight boost and let them catch up a little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt; *) Will Iksar, Beastlords, Vah Shir, Berserkers, Frogloks be playable on this server from day one?  No.  These classes and races are expansion perks and will be made available when their respective expansions have been unlocked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Nothing needs to be added to this.  If anyone feels the need to complain please see Rashere's post.&lt;br&gt;</description>
