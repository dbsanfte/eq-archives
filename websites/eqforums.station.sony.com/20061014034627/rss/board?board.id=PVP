      <title>Will the last PvP server die?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=12940#M12940</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Sadly, Deity and Team pvp dead.. I was wondering if Zek will die someday too, because I'd like to start some serious toon in PvP, but i'm scared that someday the server goes down with all my efforts (the main reason i'm posting this is because I've readed some rumors at the ooc channel in the Gloomingdeep mines and I hope that they aren't true)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You the speak no evil police? &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You keep telling people to e-mail complaints then lock the thread. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;E-mailing anyone at SOE is as useless as petitions and reporting. We complain about it here because this is where we think these problems gets voiced before getting fixed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Believe it or not, these are real problems.&amp;nbsp; That need to be adressed openly and in the community of EQ. Pretending they dont and forcing people to complain in private is only a ploy to ignoring them. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Most of us with high level toons have played this game longer and have more insight and knowledge of the game and its mechanics than most GMs and 99% or the guides.....yet you all treat us with less respect than gum found on the bottom of your shoes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I could ramble off the PnP, both as written and as enforced which are not the same.&amp;nbsp; Most of us can, im not special, yet we are told to e-mail... to report ...to petition.....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;How about being truthful? you know, honest answers? "Sorry, its been found to be cheaper to ignore PvP issues on your Server, pls petition again if you delete your AoN again, otherwise, have a nice day"&amp;nbsp; .... or "sorry, we no long have active GMs and can therefore not help you" ....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I mean, really.....Since RobertG, BradG and Dannkurt were censured by sony for being helpful, I have not had a not had a helpful response from a GM short of item replacement....How do you all sleep at night? &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Rogues in PVP</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=12897#M12897</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;It makes sense for a rogue to be able to get a BS off without being seen. Hence the new SOS improvement, but sony needs to change the way it works.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Honestly, currently a rogue can BS, Invis, BS,&amp;nbsp;Invis (&amp;nbsp;Invis removes target as well ). Without taking any damage. I just had it happen in the arena. So a possible solution would be to add a reuse timer upon attacking a PC. They have a prevent proc on Pallies BOFF that prevents use on PC's, so they can do the coding.&amp;nbsp;It makes perfect sense when they get a free BS off from the start ( when they are sneaking ) but once they reveil themselves, they shouldn't be able to go invis again, at least without alot of problems.&amp;nbsp;Anyone else agree here? I like PVP, but this is retarded...&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Just curious to why SoE nerfs all classes in pvp damage wise except rogues. Now Rogues are invisible and do 8k+ dmg on crits on one swing its a instant death if you zone... They nerfed dmg of nukes, life burns, mana burns, death touches, arrow damage, nuke damage, dot damage, but no rogue cap and you cant even see them in pvp anymore. Nice knowing no matter what kind of gear you get or aa's you will never avoid the noob kill from some rogue that is camping a zone line... And the new wizard instant nukes are fun, horsed wizard that just instant nukes and kites in circles... need to make them not castable while mounted. Gear means nothing in pvp, there may only be one pvp server but if your gonna have it you need to fix it so that its not the same rules that govern every other server for PVE... Need some balancing big time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~Matt&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I have not posted at all except once, so if I did something wrong, please inform me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Strangely my username should be Triton. I dunno why it's my alt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was gaining experience in KC today, [with my paly] I see a person following us as we headed to the very far right corner of the castle. I grouped with one of his guild mate's so I didn't think he would attack us. Lucky for him we were engaged with 2 mob's, then he attacked me down to 50 or so health. Then the mob killed me, so I get my paly to run out of the zone to loose the agro and then buff and kill the PK. Then a game of Zone and zone happened. I run back to KC with my necro that got killed so I can dot him and kill him. I went to get my body so I could do just that. The guy let me go get my body so I could get out or something. I take my body to the entrance, I am afraid he might CC me and kill me while looting the body. I then I try to run to the other side and get rez'ed by my paly zoning in. He of course trys to kill me. He trys to dooming darkness me witch failed. Then when a other game of Zone and zone happens. I finally get my corpse loot everything except a bag. He notices this and HT me. Fails, I was shocked to see I resisted his HT. I couldn't do that before, as my resists are not that high. He CC my body and such and I finally get it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So how did I resist all his spells and HT?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also dealt with a other SK later. Same story except &lt;br&gt;getting killed. :D</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;First id like to say *beep* you sony for giving an all/all quest that gives everyone a pet that hits harder then the new enchanter.&amp;nbsp; My enchanter pet hits for about 44 in PVP when this new dog hits for 81.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Second I'd like to say *beep* you sony for giving clerics a summoned hammer that hits for 500's when a lvl 74 charmed mob hits for 581.&amp;nbsp; Considering the risk of charming compared to summoning a hammer its just not fair.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Third Id like to say *beep* you sony for making an all all clicky ring with charm up to lvl 65.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Back to the point, our new Echo of Tashan spell tashes for 75 in PVE and shouldnt it tash for 112 or 113 in PVP cause of the 50% mod?&amp;nbsp; Well it doesnt maybe the patch today will fix it.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>My take on needed pvp tweaks</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=12855#M12855</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Alright, so i'm posting this right before the servers come up and we are able to see what changes come to pvp with tss, but under the assumption that some fundamental problems in pvp will remain the same, i'm making this post. Hopefully we can get some good feedback on this thread, since we know soe only changes things when&amp;nbsp;a large group of people agree on it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Bard: Everyone hates bards, theres nothing more annoying then not being able to kill someone because they run to fast. Coupled with our dispell/mez/manadrain, bards are very annoying to encounter in pvp. But then again, so are enchanters. So are clerics, so are alot of classes. Bards/encs/clerics are all annoying pvp because they do things you don't want them to, pell your buffs, take your mana, or keep the person you want to kill from dying. This happens so often that some people have actually suggested that heals should be nerfed in pvp. I'm not one of them, but it just goes to show what can come from people being annoyed. That being said, should bards really be nerfed based on their ability to annoy you, or their ability to actually kill you? I've always been a believer of the later. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Zerker snare for example was nerfed because it landed every time, and increased your chance of death about 90% when facing a group. Now thats a needed nerf. Monk 2.0 and t-staff was nerfed because they immobolized a victim for 10 secs at a time per proc, and the monk would often get frequent procs in a row. That also is a needed nerf in my point of view. Bards have never been to good at killing though. Not since increasing resists have made our dots useless, our only form of damage is melee. And when you have a 300 dps class vs a 500 dps hybrid or 600-700 dps pure melee, its easy to guess what happens most of the time. Not to say that bards desparetly need pvp help, a bard with enough aa and gear can melee effectively if they use the proper tactics, just never as good as other melee classes with their same level of gear/aa. So bards are rarely a threat when it comes to their pure melee in a pvp encounter, their effectiveness comes from those annoying abilities everyone loves to hate. That beings said, I don't think bards need any nerf at this moment.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Beastlord: I see beastlords kind of like paladins, melee class with lots of healing power, and semi decent melee. Beastlords do ok in pvp againist some classes. Pvp will never be totally balanced in class vs class situations, but beastlords have good defense skills thx to their heals, and semi decent offense. Plus a pet who does minor dps and interupts. Beatlords also have access to a burst dps ability which can easily do over 1k, useable every 30 seconds. Beastlord nukes are not totally resisted pvp, and land a good portion of the time on the average person. Beastlord slow even lands now and then, believe it or not. In summary beastlords may not have the best offense, but they have good heals. The only thing beastlords need in pvp is a pet upgrade. The 60% pet damage cap should be removed from pvp to resolve this problem and other problems with pets in pvp. Back in the day it was a good idea, as pets could easily and consistently hit pcs in pvp. Nowdays even at low lvs pets are not good dps. The ever changing gear standard has far outpaced pets ability to do decent dps. From level 10 to 70, pets will be useful for nothing but interupts vs 80% of people. The only exception I can think of is the mage epic pet, which outperforms other pets of its level by far, and can be used effectively throughout the low 50s. Besides the epic pet however pets are generally pretty weak. Rogue pet or warrior pet, it doesn't matter, its easy to just ignore them in pvp. Therefore there is no reason to keep the 60% pet damage cap on, as 80% of the people on zek at any level are geared enough for it to make pets underpowered instead of the overpowered it was designed to fix.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Berzerkers: Berzerkers are fine in pvp atm, maybe a little too good even. With 4-5 useful pvp discs and a reliable stun/snare to stop kiters, plus the fact that they innately do high dps, berzerkers need no pvp upgrades atm. An fight between a berzerker and another class with equal gear/aa can easily go ethier way, almost regardless of the class fighting the berzerker. Even a paladin has a chance of being disced on and getting their heals out dpsed by a large % thanks to permastun granted by cleaving anger disc+mind strike. Berzerkers definately need no upgrades.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Cleric: Don't think clerics need any upgrades besides giving their chromatic nuke a better pvp check. They derserve at least one offense spell that lands.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Druid: A druid with barkspur and reptile skin can do pretty decent in pvp vs melees. And druid dots still land effectively, as do their nukes. That being said druids don't really need anything, a druid has both the potental to dps and stay alive if they are played well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Enchanter: Enchanters have access to very good pells, manadrains, and mezzes. Enchanters just need a better pvp resist check to their pvp nuke so they can go offense if they want to. Of course the chromatic nuke no doubt already lands well on many people, but with coa+geared melees it can be difficult. Not much to ask I don't think, just allow them to get a little damage in instead of mostly resists.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Magician:Mage bolts still land a good amount of the time, regardless of fire resist. Beings an int caster they can take high amounts of damage from melees, but mages never were meant to have good defense. They do have a few spells to help defense, such as pyrilen skin and melee migitation aa. Mages need no upgrades besides their pets which I covered earlier.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Monk: Um, no upgrades needed! With the potential to heal themselves 60% hp every 6min, coupled with another 20% heal every 3, on top of 3.5k heal pot every 2, monks need no upgrades. They do both&amp;nbsp;good dps and have good defense.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Necromancer: Necros need pet upgrade+dot upgrades. Currently necros can only land splurt, pyrocuror, and lifetap in pvp. And even lifetap can be resisted up to 5 times in a row on certain people. Necros need at least a small chance to land their normal dots instead of having to rely on low lv ones. I believe necros are fine for pvp up until 65 or so, only changes to higher lv spells pvp resists need to be made to help their dps.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Paladin: Paladins have a self heal proc ward with a 400 proc rate mod, large mana pools to cast hots and other heals, tons of ac and hp, and access to a 2hander that crits for 1.6k with 700 hits being normal. Paladins may not be able to stop opponents from running, but they are nearly unbeatable in terms of actual fighting. Paladins just need one stun which has a chance to land in pvp. Not a stun that always lands like telakara or zerker stun, just something thats not 92% fail like all their stuns are currently.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ranger: Rangers have both offense and defense. Naturally a dps class, rangers can dps in pvp easily, and with a horse can stay on anyone and continue to dps as they run.&amp;nbsp;Add their 1.6k heals and 3k crit heals rangers have no problem staying alive in pvp for long periods of time. Plus rangers have access to a chromatic snare which lands frequently on many people, they need no upgrades.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Rogue: Some people may think all rogues are gimpy in pvp, but they'd be wrong. Rogues do about as much pure melee as a monk, just with no heals. The upside is that rogues can backstab for enormous amounts of damage. Recently I took a set of 2 3k backstabs from a rogue during group pvp and died, which is very good backstab damage. A rogue who is skilled and knows how to get behind you can be very good at pvp, and rogues are guaranteed as effective dpsers in group pvp, which is most of the game. I don't see why rogues would need any upgrades at this time, they fufill their role well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Shadowknight: Shadowknight taps may not land 100%, but they still land enough to heal the sk. Sks are impressive in pvp for the most part, wielding high damage 2handers and able to knock off thousands of hp over time with dots and taps, they also get the benefit of being a tank class, with lots of ac and hp. SKs can hold their own in most situations even without the infamous DT, so I conclude they do not need any upgrades at this time.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Shaman: Shamans's need some of their dots upgraded for sure. The only dot which lands from shamans in pvp is nectar of pain, and even thats not reliable for them. Its certain that a shaman with both many dots that landed pvp and good healing power would be able to pvp effectively. Shaman dots should be changed at higher lvs just like necros, they need a better pvp resist check. Shamans deserve at least 1-2 spells they can count on for when they want to go offense, as currently their best dps is any ds they cast on themselves,and their proc spell.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Wizard: Wizards are ranged dps, glasscannons. With 1.5/2.0 click they can land ether flame and white fire easily, and even without those 2 spell lines land a portion of the time for up to 4k a hit. Plus wizard lures land consistently most of the time. Wizards need no pvp upgrades atm, as they can land spells enough to do decent dps, which is their job.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Warrior: Some people might think warriors are gimp, but they really aren't. As the best tank class and the most hp of any class in the game, as well as the best ac, warriors lower dps is helped by their hp. A long time ago warriors were pretty bad, they would get snared and be unable to do any damage at all, while they slowly died to dots and nukes. Nowdays as resists are getting higher all the time, warriors can resist quite a few spells. That factor along with their flurry aa, warriors can dps well in pvp, easily getting rounds over 1k consistently. Plus warriors now have access to several useful pvp discs, so they don't need to much of an upgrade in todays pvp.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Alright well I know this was a long post, but I wanted to get every class. Hopefully we can all agree on at least a few things here so we can show soe what the community wants.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Well, we tried.&amp;nbsp; Over the last few months we revived our old toons, moved them to Zek, leveled them all to 70, and took a shot at recapturing the magic of EQ for us.&amp;nbsp; For us, anyway, no dice.&amp;nbsp; It's gone, and it's not coming back.&amp;nbsp; We even tried the progression server, but Freeport circa 1999 isn't coming back either.&amp;nbsp; 300 people who know what they're doing trying to race each other to the end-game doesn't feel anything like it did when it was a bunch of people with no idea what they were doing, and every new discovery was golden.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the final straw for us is looking at this new expansion.&amp;nbsp; I've tried for months, and I watched others try on this forum, to get SOE to address a PvP system that's fundamentally broken.&amp;nbsp; They don't even bother to pay lip-service anymore.&amp;nbsp; It's all about the next expansion, and the next uber-boss, and the next raid-zone.&amp;nbsp; That's who the game is for now, and that's not us.&amp;nbsp; For those who are out there chewing through each expansion that they pop out, my sincere hope that you have fun with the time that EQ has left.&amp;nbsp; For us, it's time to go.&amp;nbsp; Fortunately we've found a new love in the process of being born.&amp;nbsp; It's a rush to start over again with a new game, and a new world in beta.&amp;nbsp; It's looking good, and our hopes are high.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wish you all well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>pvp spell question</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=12727#M12727</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have a question about some spells in pvp&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1. how come the following spells will land extremely easy in pvp: &lt;A href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=3437" target=_blank&gt;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=3437&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;.. &lt;A href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=3446" target=_blank&gt;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=3446&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;,, &lt;A href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=5348" target=_blank&gt;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=5348&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp; ..&amp;nbsp; &lt;A href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=5357" target=_blank&gt;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=5357&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp; .. &lt;A href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=5361" target=_blank&gt;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=5361&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2. but the following will not:&amp;nbsp; &lt;A href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=2885" target=_blank&gt;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=2885&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;..&amp;nbsp; &lt;A href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=4890" target=_blank&gt;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=4890&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;.. &lt;A href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=7994" target=_blank&gt;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=7994&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;.. &lt;A href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=5437" target=_blank&gt;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=5437&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp; ..&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;also why is it that a nuke as listed under number 1 lands quite often and often for a nice amount of damage and has a resist check of a big fat 0, when this spell &lt;A href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=6143" target=_blank&gt;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=6143&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp; with a resist check of -200 doesnt?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;i dont know about other people but as a necro and dots being my main thing in eq, i really dont like going into pvp and getting out dotted by a crappy druid spell, its both f-ing lame and annoying how those 2 druid dots land and are both a higher level spell when mine wont land with the same resist check number.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;also the dots i can land, it takes 5 just to add up to the damage of the 1 druid dot, how stupid is that? being out dotted in pvp by a druid.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;any answers as to why this is allowed??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;i dont really like to sit there and play the game of: can i out lifetap your lame 0 resist check nuke, when the answer is no.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;also pinhead maybe you can answer this, why has SOE let pvp get so **SMURF** annoying?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
