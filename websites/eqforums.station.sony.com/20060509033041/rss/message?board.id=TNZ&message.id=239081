    <description>I recently purchased Everquest yesterday. The Titanium edition which comes with ten of their expansions. It was 20$ so I assumed this was a very nice deal and immeditaly bought it and subscribed play.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two years ago I had fond memories of all the fun I had at Greater Faydark. So I picked my starting city as Kelethin. Logged on, then got to Kelethin. I was the only person in the zone!! There used to be 200+ people there a few years ago, lol?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I thought wait, its just probably the server. I tried 4 other servers, including the PvP, and all of them had 0 people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now let me ask you this, does barely anyone play Everquest? Or did I pick the bad servers?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If  I didn't pick bad servers, I find this totally ridiculous on Sony's part. You cannot sell a game that is basicially a single player, false marketing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-sorry im a little mad, mike-&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;br&gt;I agree, I haven't seen more than ten toons in gfeydark since 2004. Around twice I have seen as many as 15 toons there in the past 6 months. More likely 2-6 toons there at the same time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>Realistically there's no reason to spend time in GFay. The mobs are all green by level 15, and the experience is not good below 15. Main characters are mostly over 55 now, if not over 65. People playing alts are more likely to take their alts to better exp/more fun zones. If GFay were so overwhelmingly fun, there would be more people in it hehe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I agree. Play your char until the progression server comes out, and then you'll have a lot of people your level to play with, and many of them will be back in GFay (or wherever you choose to start out). Yes, there will be CB raids. It'll be a lot of fun, all in all.</description>

As soon as Luclin launched, first The Nexus and then The Bazaar became the general gathering zones, and most players between 6th and 24th  were in Paludal Caverns. Once PoP came out, everyone that wasn't selling in The Bazaar relocated to Plane of Knowledge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That said, there are still always people in Crushbone whenever I go there on Stromm. In fact, there are often so many in there that I get KS'd and trained. Stromm does have a solid low-level population though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;i find the emptiness in some of the old world zones very refreshing.  i can hunt camps all by myself to lvl versus the old days.  Orc I and II in EC all my myself.  Derv camp in WC, crushbone, gobbies in BB, Sand Giants in SRo etc...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;yes, grouping is important, but after 25 or 30, it gets so much earlier to find a group or join a guild and have some bored higher lvl's shroud down to group with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;we've started some LDoN grouping on FV with a friends list of 20 that are going to spend a few hours a week to max out our adventurers gem.  if you find ppl that share a similar goal, you can find groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="5"&gt;i would stress you go back to tutorial and get your kobold skull charm. it's one of the best charms in the game until you get to higher levels, aug that charm with the slipgear gem quest (do 4 of the 5 zones in the  quest at lvl 10 in gobbie rogue shroud) and you've got charm w/ aug that gives +10-15 all stats, all resis's and hp/mana/endur.  pretty killer for lvl 10.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="5"&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Personally, I think telling him to wait for the progressive server is bad advice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game has changed significantly over the years.  Instead of bemoaning why they game was not frozen in time, why not go out there and discover all that has been added and changed to the game.  There is quite a lot out there.  Some of it will require some leveling up for sure, but there are plenty of people to play.  Instead of focusing on trying to do things you already did in the past, look for all the new things you have not experienced.  A lot of the stuff is very cool, and ultimately EQ today is much better than it was 7 years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Yes, people play EQ - lots.  You didn't pick a bad server - probably (what makes a server bad?).  Older zones(traditional zones?), like Greater Faydark, are infrequently  traveled unless there is a specific purpose to go there.  Older players are too high level, newer players go to POK.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Simply stated.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Yeah...I hate the tutorial and PoK too; but you don't have to stay there long. Or do your home city quests alone..then Kurn's--&amp;gt;Paludal--&amp;gt;whatever I guess...</description>

      <description>Simply put, no, there aren't low-levels in those zones anymore.  Not as many people start playing EQ as there used to be.  The tutorial is your main option if you want to group with other people.  It's not a single player game, but the game *is* incredibly top heavy - most everyone is high level at this point.  Realize that it IS a 6 year old game!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People do go to zones &amp;quot;just for fun&amp;quot; but you won't find many at the low levels, just because there's not many people at the low levels, period.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
