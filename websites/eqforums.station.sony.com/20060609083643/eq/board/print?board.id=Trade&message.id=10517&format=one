				<div></div><p>Ok, you successfully forced me to go back to my old stats book.  If the probability of success on a combine is p, the expected number of trials until success is 1/p and the variance is (1-p)/(p*p) (geometric distribution).  The simplest equation with all the moving parts you're looking for is:</p><p>Selling price x probability of success = (1 + profit margin %) x material costs.</p><p>A more useful formulation for setting prices is Selling price / material costs = (1 + profit margin %) / probability of success</p><p>I am assuming you're defining profit margin % as (Selling Price - Expected Value of material costs) / Expected value of material costs.</p><p>Assuming you're trying to come out ahead, one approach would be to set the profit margin as a multiplier of the first standard deviation of your expected costs.  This has the advantage of providing you more margin when you're taking on more risk.  For example, if you set your profit margin at 1x standard deviation, your profit margin on a 95% combine would be about 23.5% and you're sell price = 1.30 x  your material prices.   On a 70% combine, your required profit margin would jump to 78.2% for an expected selling price of 2.55 x material price.   In other words, to appropriately compensate you for your risk, don't just price off expected value.  Variance matters and people are paying you not only for your skill but to avoid taking the risk themselves.</p><p>Hope this is helpful.</p>
