      <description>I arrived when the tutorial was up to level 5. I found some home cities still crowded. Like Kelethin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I really don't believe the tutorial killed anything. It certainly got me to sign up and play EQ 1. Without something to show me how to play them game, i would never have started. I remember the huge drop in players when WOW started. It was the month WOW opened for anyone, that I saw a huge drop in the number of player toons in any zone.  So, I prefer to blame it on competition. I tried wow for 2 weeks.  I didn't like it. Even with my newer machine, i don't see me ever going back to wow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'll stick with EQ 1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For myself, I have told several people about EQ 1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How many of you who complain about the lack of player toons in EQ 1, have told others about EQ 1 ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't see any adverts for EQ, so word of mouth is the only way lots of potential players are goig to hear of this MMO game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

Sell off whatever you can't use.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;yes, this is a very good idea, which I think most players don't catch onto.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And uhm... I probably shouldn't mention this...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there is a rock right between the glooming deep froglok banker and Wijdan the merchant. Sit on it. You have to find the best spot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Med and heal there. And you can open the merchant window, buy and sell, close the merchant window. Then right click on the banker, and put your extra monies and items you want to keep in your bank. All while meding. If you get the /con type message from either NPC, you aren't in the correct spot. It might take a bit of a search, but that spot on that rock does exist. I found it by accident, and I use it for every spell casting toon I send through the tutorial.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I played, until several months ago, with a 550MHz 512 meg of ram win98se computer with an ati card with 32 megs of video ram in it. I had video down to low on almost everything. All models turned off. The lag was noricable when arriving in pok with over 100 toons already there. I found if I approached the main bank with f9 giving me an overhead view, it wasn't so bad. Under the advanced display options, I had all of those unchecked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now I have a 1.5 gig computer at 2.6 GHz, with a 128 meg ati radeon. I have the models turned on to give me the roboboar on one toon, and the warhorse from por for another one. The advanced display options are on for what my card supports.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would suggest you turned down or off various display options until you find what works best for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then move across POK, near main bank,and see if it still lags.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uhm, you may want to avoid doing that if someone is mentioning a MGB is about to happen. That lags my computer. That and all the screaming in /ooc to please wait.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That can lag my computer to. :-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>I've been here since May, 2004, and I got dumped in my home town at level 5, after I finished the tutorial.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ice did a list, I think it was Ice, the tutorial has gone through 4 or 5 versions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There were very few player toons in the home towns when I first started playing, west freeport and qeynos being the ones I started out with. When I took my wood elf warrior to Kelethin, there were more players there. Shrug, i got the emerald warrir armor for two toons, they are 12th and 14th, then I retired them. I prefer druids and rangers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now everyone goes to POK. At least there are other players to talk to there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've even see other players at Forgotten Halls recently. Last month I rarely saw anyone there but my toons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I did enjoy the tutorial, except the now vanished potion you got when giving a glooming deep mushroom to the female dark elf. That potion I miss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, enough babbling from me. :-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>I'm still learning on how to put what where in my spell lists, but yes, spots 7-0 are detrimental, and 2-4 are buffs or heals. And dpenidng on other character classes, throw stone, throw, kick, taunt, any bow, are in there as well. Along with forage. I do try to be consistant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I just need to work on swapping them out when i need to. I need to re-read the thread in here on how to make it easy to swap out spell sets according to what my toon is doing, buffing in pok or soloing mobs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

Both the rat and my toon took out my toon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I med and heal between each rat, if my hp is below half. So it is posssible to solo in FH.

      <description>There are two discussions threads around here on Forgotten halls. One has a link to a page on who to talk to to get the expedition. It can be boring, but it was the first time I ever saw a rat kick my toon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>I have two of my toons on Xegony in the low 20s, so I'll be working on two of my toons on Stromm. One is 8th and the other just made 15th. Maybe I'll work on my DE wizard on Xegony, who is presently at 11th.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>
