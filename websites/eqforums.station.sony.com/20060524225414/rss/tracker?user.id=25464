      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I can see the dev's reading this and the expression on their faces. Then the I told ya so idiot stands up and says " I told ya so . PvP is so screvved we will never be able to fix it". Next news you will read will be about the next 3 expansions and how to /rewind out of the spider webs they will never fix. There are so many regards to which PvP needs fixing that the dev's would need at least a good year to figure it all out. The problem in all essence needed to be avoided and not patched which is the exact opposite of SOE's tradition. Im still suprised that the "Nerf Bat" isn't an obtainable weapon in game yet.&amp;nbsp; And even that will be nerfed.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To Occlusion&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Yes NL,DSP,ME were all choke zones for raid zones but it was becoming tradition to fight there everyday regardless if mobs were up or not and it was some good fun. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Its the fact that PvP on SZ occurs more frequently than other Zek's and we notice ever single pvp bug in the game every day all day. Whereas someone someone from RZ might have seen one PvP fight ever. I dont know much about TZ/VZ except it has a level restriction and that reason alone ruins it. I still have reason to believe deaths on SZ by pvp outnumber all 3 servers combined. I've played on RZ a long time ago and to even call it a PvP server is kinda weird. Its like giving the players on that server credit for something the don't deserve.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

I think that if the spells doing no more then 40% of a persons total hp's is more then enough of a nerf. it doesnt need to be nerfed that much or anymore then that. I cant even imagine how'd you begin to balance nerfing this vs the paladin lay on hands ability. why should shadowknights get shafted and paladins have a spell that complete heals them? doesnt make sense to me.&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;hey slow one... Death Touch kills a person instantly that is below 75% life. This is a little hard to swallow since during pvp they spear, double/triple for 600 and DT you in one shot. Think about this on a massive scale.. if two factions fight (evil vs&amp;nbsp;newt) all the clerics on the newt team are dead within less than 20 seconds. DT is down on half of the Evil crew with no loss of hps/mana.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now you are bringing them up against Paladins... Ok once the paladin hits 74% life the fight is over. End of arguement.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;There was no doubt in my mind the whole server was having the most fun during that time period. The trail of corpses from Netherbain Lair to Umbral Plains was insanity. The newts were at a record high getting up to 100 members online during prime time and the evils forget it. Since that era all teams have been on a downward slope including evils.&amp;nbsp; As trains became more prevelant and PvP was non-existant people started quiting. Most of Hate folded as well. Their members got sick of farming Quarm on every pop and nothing to do afterward made it not really worthwhile. I would really like to see PVP come back to SZ in the worst way and I believe it has alot to do with trains killing the fun. Either that or let me move to RZ so I can join the 18 man vs the bluebie world over there on RZ and hand some beatdowns out :P&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;We are geared well enough. We do ikkinz successfully with about 35 people and gearing up quite well actually. Without VT and the no train agreement we would not be where we are now and we didn't have the 24/7 trainers that Hate has to keep them from doing events. Bottom line is they would have gotten RZ eventually and we will still have been getting trained in VT.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;We agreed on both evil and newts teams to stop training each other and it was a good time. We actually PvPed for hours on end guild vs guild and I have to say that time was the most fun I ever had in EQ. Yes they got EP but it gave the dying newt team some air to breathe for a few months while we geared up. Now that training has reinsued the server is destroyed again and there is absoulutely no PvP again. Hence the reason I'm on these boards and not having fun in EQ.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I have played numerous online PvP games. EQ is the only pvp environment I have seen that doesnt require skill to pvp. (It only requires better gear and levels on your opponent). &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This is true to an extent but there is a ton of skill involved. Take SZ for example. Hate outgears us newts like you wouldnt believe. They are all Time gear+ and we are SSRA/VT with a lil ikkinz and we beat them down 99% of the time with same numbers. Then Speedd comes and trains us :P its lol.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you look at EQ in the early stages the Dev's actually made some kind of counter for everything. Yes faction burning rogues like Tasselhoff probably made you quit too early to experience what im talking about but up until about&amp;nbsp;2 years ago there was always a trick to beating someone else. Now at high end game there is absolutely no way to stop training since AE mes and AE stuns were waved bye bye to long ago once the trains comes if your TL boxes arent up its log off for the night.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Having fun killing the sheep on RZ? SZ is dead right now its almost as bluebie as RZ. My interest&amp;nbsp;are, if they make VZ/TZ a guild wars server ill move to one of those till WoW. Anyway I wonder if the Dev's read these posts. Probably not though :/.&amp;nbsp; They convince themselves that alot of the players dont like PvP and that gives them ammunition to trash any good PvP ideas that Rytan comes up with.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hey speedd im quite familiar with the ruleset of Sullon Zek. It's the responsibility of the Dev team to keep the rules of the servers in note while making expansions. It's quite obvoius they dropped the ball here. PoP was a complete failure by the Dev team and as they look back now im sure they agree. I love the PvE content but the zone design could have been done better by the retarded kid who refills the ketchup dispensers at McDonalds. With the AA's they gave the bards in PoP+ and the zones the way they are training could be made any easier. Instant stun and FM. Gimme a break already. Monks can't even FD correctly half the time but a bard can clear aggro with no problems dumping 100+ mob train that hits for 600+ on a raid force.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The last line on the Sullon Zek ruleset states as follows:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Keep in mind that we will probably be making some changes to this server as things progress.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think things have progressed far enough, and its time to make some changes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;cool you made me a newbie again!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anyway I have to hand it to you... You are the best bard EQ has ever seen as far as training goes, but I do think there is a difference between no Play Nice Policy and Harrasment. I could give a @#$# either way. Alot of people do envy you and its quite obvious. If i had a nickel for every human evil bard running around wanting to be you I'd be a rich man. Dedicating your entire life to ruining a server is a great career choice however I do kind of think its sad that you are the evil teams pet. You do realize that no evil pvp's with a very few exeptions. I like PvP and its the lack thereof that is causing people to leave. Trains are kind of PvP free and an easy way to keep other teams down since no one can cast spells or hit you etc. I would like to see the Hate guild come out of hiding and actually win a fight with all those time geared bluebie RZ wannabes instead of you training a raid and then them zerging into the zone to CC everyone. But hey if thats how you want the server so be it.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Well gink, I would like to see SoE do something.. I mean i just logged onto SZ and there are about 100 people online roughly and 100 traders in bazaar. So... SZ not doing so good. No one logs on anymore just a few evil noobs that form up in pok and do the truffle shuffle to ldon safety xp zones. I look for PvP and there isn't a single soul around. You have a better chance of seeing the Easter Bunny xping in PoValor than finding PvP.&amp;nbsp; If you ask me the server is comepletey destroyed but fixing PvP is only their solution to compete with WoW and a few other games in production atm because its not our voices that are opening sony's eyes its the competition I don't care what John Smedley says. We all would like to see training stopped on SZ as it truly only helps and benefits the evil team with their GM accessiblity. Even if they banned training today I still dont think the goodie/newt teams would have enough people left to advance to EP and beyond. The Evil team is the only one left with a massive force due to the lead GM's banning newts/goods for training or what we call fighting fire with fire. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As far as PvP balancing goes DD's that are an ability such as DT/LB/MB should only be reduced to 40% max.&amp;nbsp; Nerfing DD's will make Wizards stupid since they have no pet/defense as it is.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Melees are far over powered as it is and buffing them will only make it worse. Just because someone doesn't know how to joust doesnt mean you should make pvp easier for them.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Rangers do need archery tuned back up since they are now the laughing stock of PvP on SZ.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Why are SK/Necro lines pretty much lure.&amp;nbsp; SK's can do the same amount of damage as a wizard and last time i looked they have a few more hps, there isnt that much difference between spears and lures.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Why is pal divine stun not lure?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Why can bards train entire PoP zones and not take a single hit? &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Why is AA belows instant cast and amazingly hard to resist? Wasnt rapture bad enough? You should have to stand still to use rapture pvp?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Why is Wristand of Secrets better than the Enchanter spell Recant Magic? 3.0 sec no recast&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Why is it that melees destroy everyone End Game and still need to be buffed? Are you guys watching RZ for PVP help lol&amp;nbsp;w.t.f.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Wristband of secrets cast time needs to be changed due to not having a recast time.. 12 buffs in 9 seconds is a little crazy.. I suggest making the the cast time 4.5 seconds due to not having a recast time.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;NM my last post if you can choose who can accept your bounty that will work. It would be great for low lvls to put bounties out on griefers and maybe even be able to give a last zone in which the person was seen and a time~&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
