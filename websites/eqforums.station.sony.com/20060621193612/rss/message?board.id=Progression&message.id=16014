    <title>shouldn't the combine server be appreciated?</title>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What many will be afraid of is the competition pre Luclin EQ had. Waiting lists in LGuk, 100+ people in GFay, dwarves in BB, etc. We have been spoiled by having so much content there is always somewhere descent to go raid, farm, level. This server will be very competative and if anyone thinks that it wont be you are sadly mistaken. Everyone is going to be grinding as fast as they can, everyone is going to be getting the newbie armors because it will take them at least until lvl 30, and everyone will complain the whole way. I fail to understand how this is different than my Everquest experiences until Luclin was released. There will be a few diferences, but meditating without my spellbook at lvl 1 is going to make the experience that much better.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The first time I ever logged into EQ I had a Half Elf Ranger in Kelethin and I logged in in the middle of the night. Because I had no idea what Kelethin was supposed to be I thought it was a cave and I had to find my way out. What I did find was 1 LOADING Please Wait screen away... the default bind point. I then proceeded to think that when killed I would spawn randomly near my corpse. While this was true in the newbie area I later came to realize that I was mistaken. Instead of retrieving my corpse I logged off planning on retrieving it the next day. After reading some of my EQ strategy guide I found out corpses disappear and my ranger was once again naked.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I don't know why anyone would want to repeat adventures like loosing all of your gear, but I sure wont miss that kind of disappointment. What seems to be the common story is the only reason I quit EQ is because all of my friends/family members that played left for WoW. Comparing EQ to WoW is a lot easier than most people think. Raiding 4-5 times a week&amp;nbsp;on MC/AQ/ZG/BWL/etc compared to KT/PoT/etc is pretty much a dungeon grind. EQ and WoW have dissapointed me in the same way. EQ has so much content that most of the world is empty while WoW created Battlegrounds which made world PVP almost all ganking or being ganked. Not to mention the farmers and PVP will be even worse after the expansion (imagine someone in tier .5 compared to someone in tear 4-6). WoW is only 9 expansions behind EQ and will most likely progress to the same status, and most of my friends that left EQ for WoW have already left WoW for real life, FPS games, and even chat rooms. Already zones like shimmering flats and feralas are near empty other than the occasional grinder just begging to be ganked repeatadly along with the great difficulty creating a group for WC, RFD, or BRD.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;EQ hasn't been a loss and never will be. UO and dii are both alive and the worst thing that would happen is&amp;nbsp;SOE stops releasing new content. I haven't even been in half of EQ's zones and have a 70 nec and a 70 ranger with epic 1.5. The worste damage caused to EQ were the massive amount of MMORPGs that are allowed to distort the market. Each game takes a few people away from each MMORPG because it has that one thing they were looking for. SWG was responsible for that upset and didn't continue on a good role due to the fact that there was nothing to do but gank the people trying to solo kimogilas and krayt dragons (lets not get into what CU did to it /shudder).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This server will be something that EQ fans have asked for so many times over and I'm hoping I'll see some old faces. I also can't wait for naggy/vox raids where ya get buffed then have to log out to a chat room so your buffs don't fade by the time you're ready to go. This is the only game that I could have so much fun being bored because I was trying to surround the Priest of Discord in Gfay in my corpses and a GM said I was corpse littering. I've never seen a GM think a petition was so funny before nor did I think I could be reported for such an endevor.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In conclusion, I really hope theres more than 1 combine server at launch because there is going to be such a massive amount of people that jump on this server and I am terrified that I will have to roll a wizard so I can win the KS battles. I am grateful that we can all be reminded why we complained so much about the trains in Unrest, Venril Sathir trains to zone in of KC, and wiping when trying to take PoFear. I for one have never lost as much experience on any raid other than Plane of Fear where your raid can arrive as all 50s and worry about wiping so many times you can't re-enter the zone. There will be more than enough "old world magic" to shove down your throat and it has been unexplored for so long that we will be pleasantly surprised with how many times we'll die getting to the top with a full set of newbie gear and a Stein of Moggok. You cirtainly wont find any other server farming Robe of the Oracle or Fighting Batons.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
