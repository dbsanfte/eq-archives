    <description>Pet or not, it can still be dinner. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There were plenty of times my grandfather and my mother had to strangle pet chickens for dinner. I've even had to do it once or twice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While there are more humane ways of doing it, sometimes those aren't an option. Like cutting the head off of one. A headless chicken running around everywhere may sound funny, but it is messy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006260795,00.html" target=_blank&gt;http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006260795,00.html&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=norm12&gt;A FINALIST in a competition to find Britain’s best single parent is a convicted child abuser. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Kate Rayner, 40,&amp;nbsp;won a regional heat of holiday firm Eurocamp’s Lone Parent Of The Year contest.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But The Sun can reveal that in 2001 the mum of four escaped a jail term after being convicted of child cruelty and assaulting son Huw.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In a catalogue of sadism he was: &lt;STRONG&gt;BEATEN&lt;/STRONG&gt; daily, had his hands put in &lt;STRONG&gt;BOILING&lt;/STRONG&gt; water &lt;STRONG&gt;STARVED&lt;/STRONG&gt; for days; and made to &lt;STRONG&gt;KILL&lt;/STRONG&gt; his pet chicken with his bare hands.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;His mother’s horrific past emerged only when Huw, now 20, read of her contest triumph in a local newspaper.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Rayner, who nominated herself, bragged of how she was raising her children while studying for a degree in English literature.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;She also wrongly claimed that Huw had Asperger’s syndrome and she still cared for him.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But Huw ran away at the age of 13 and was taken into care after years of appalling abuse.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Last night Huw, of St Ives, Cambs, said: “I couldn’t believe she was on the shortlist. I haven’t seen her since I gave evidence against her five years ago.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;“I was starved for days on end, beaten with wooden planks and made to sleep outside. I don’t understand why she’s done this.”&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Rayner and partner William Emmanuel-Blake were convicted at Peterborough Crown Court in 2001 of abusing Huw. &lt;STRONG&gt;She got a three-year community order, he got two years’ jail. :smileymad:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Rayner — who also has daughters aged 18, 16 and two — pulled out of Eurocamp’s contest when confronted about her past.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;She told The Sun: “I don’t want to say anything.”&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;

      <description>...was I the only one expecting to read uphill in the snow both ways for 15 miles, and we liked it! at the end of the abuse list?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seriously though, that's pretty wacked. All except the chicken part. That isn't abuse, that's just preparing dinner. &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

They also said it was a pet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are considerably more humane ways to kill a chicken.</description>
