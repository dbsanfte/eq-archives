    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;well like many people last year i subscribed to EQ under their 6th anniversary promotional offer, a pretty good deal. one that comes with some unwritten fine print.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;first of all, you cannot renew that biliing term under a diferent credit card than the one it was purchased on. that means if your credit card expires is lost stolen or you cancel it and wish to renew your account under the promotional offer, tough luck~&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;what does this mean? this means that everyone who signed up for that promotional offer is going to one day be kicked out of it. might want to send int those complaints now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;second, i was informed that this is clearly stated in the ToS which i read thoroughly and found nothing of this fine print, the only lose interpretation is a link to everquestlive.com that in the end also does not state that if you dont use the same credit card for the lifetime of your EQ account that your going to lose out on promotional offers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;my recommendation is that if you signed up for this policy you call in and ask to talk to the customer service representative in charge, her name is Rachel shes the supervisor and she will tell you that this is everquests policy clearyl stated in the ToS, which i have found that it is not. oh the number that they dont like to show anymore for sony technical support is 1-(858)-537-0898 call in and ask~&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;if this hasn't happened yet remember when your card expires it will, so everyone who signed up for the offer will go through this sooner or later&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>If you have complaints regarding the quality of service you have received, we ask that you email eqcs@soe.sony.com with the details of the complaint and the ticket number of the petition you submitted regarding the original issue. This email address is not intended as an alternative method to the in-game petition system and should only be used for complaints regarding quality of service.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The eqcs@soe.sony.com email address can also be used to offer feedback and suggestions regarding ways to improve the ticketing system. Feedback and suggestion emails, while important to SOE and often quite useful, will most likely not receive a response.</description>
