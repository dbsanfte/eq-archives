      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ok i am a lvl 15 drakkin necro almost 16 where do we drakkins get our non research spells from? I have bought any that were in Pok and the bazaar but still can not find the basics. Also where can we buy our research book at? Do i have to make another necro/race toon and buy them that way or am i missing something?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Thanks for any advice or tips here its really frustrating spending my time searching for these things instead of grinding levels.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Lowbie Mana Regen Issues?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Necromancers&amp;message.id=9522#M9522</link>
      <description>While playing with my new necro character on one of the progression servers recently, I noticed some very odd things.&amp;nbsp; I've tried searching for similar issues here, but haven't found too much to enlighten me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is currently level 11.&amp;nbsp; (Yes, I have older necros on a few of the regular servers, but haven't actively played them since tSS release.)&amp;nbsp; Several days ago, I noticed that Dark Pact was suddenly eating her hps like mad even while sitting, which was never the case in the past.&amp;nbsp; However, since she seemed to be regenning mana quite nicely when in OOC mode, doing without it wasn't really slowing down my hunting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tonight -- which was the first time I'd xp hunted with her since the last patch, rather than merely farming silk for her armor -- the OOC mana regen seemed horribly slow, however ... so I compared the regen rate between in-combat, during count-down, and out-of-combat.&amp;nbsp; The result was the same in each case.&amp;nbsp; In other words, she appeared to be getting no benefit from being in the OOC state.&amp;nbsp; So I tried Dark Pact again.&amp;nbsp; Lo and behold, it was more or less back to normal.&amp;nbsp; (I say "more or less," because the jerky movement in her hp bar gave me the impression that it's still eating hps like mad, but is now balanced out by OOC hp regen.&amp;nbsp; I didn't have it on during combat tonight, so I can't say for sure; will have to test it more thoroughly another time.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is pretty much untwinked except for an FBR (which is the only mana-related thing I've changed during the relevant period of time, but I can't see how that would make the difference).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any thoughts?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>A request and suggestions for changes to lifeshards</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Necromancers&amp;message.id=9513#M9513</link>
      <description>I'm pretty sure it's clear that lifeshards need to be changed, at least for the majority of the necromancer community, so I have compiled a list of possible changes that might make everyone happy:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A.)&amp;nbsp; Remove them from the game completely, and make our mezz use no reagent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;B.)&amp;nbsp; Remove them from the game completely, and make our mezz use soul orbs as a reagent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;C.)&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
Make lifeshards stackable, not lore, and not poof apon death.&amp;nbsp; Give&#xD;
them a different recast timer for their heal, and an instant cast for&#xD;
it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;D.)&amp;nbsp; Keep them lore, but take away the temporary tag, make&#xD;
them not poof on death, leave them as a reagent that doesn't get used&#xD;
up, and give them a much better heal (like the original way they were&#xD;
in the beta with a HoT potion effect).&amp;nbsp; This way they only go away if&#xD;
we use the lifeshard for healing purposes, and otherwise they stay&#xD;
around.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would be equally pleased by any of the above&#xD;
solutions.&amp;nbsp; Some might be better than others because you can keep the&#xD;
animal only lifetaps in the game and thus keep you devs happy, and please the player base.&amp;nbsp; However, please give it some&#xD;
thought, we really need a change to this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Aegrusnecrox&lt;br&gt;75 Necromancer of Maelin Starpyre&lt;br&gt;&amp;lt;PACTUM&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
Could we possibly get the EE proc rate tweeked on Vakk'dra's Sickly&#xD;
Mists and Venin?&amp;nbsp; In addition where are our pet illusion spells? &lt;img src="../../i/smilies/16x16_smiley-sad.gif" border="0" height="16" width="16"&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Did they fix necros in this patch?&amp;nbsp; Seeing as how they moved the&#xD;
Affliction Efficiency thread to the necro boards where no dev is ever&#xD;
brave enough to go, what is the word on how OOC regen has impacted on&#xD;
necro grp roles, our weak lich upgrade, the destruction of the class as&#xD;
a reasonable grping option, and the removal of the focus that actually&#xD;
preserved mana on dots?&amp;nbsp; What's happening?&amp;nbsp; My subscription&#xD;
renewal is up soon and I really want to know how they are addressing&#xD;
the issues for necros.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Necromancers&amp;message.id=9492#M9492</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;well, with the launch of tss came alot more dps from various classes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;necros are the masters of efficient over time damage. but when it comes to 95% of the group situatiosn im in now, my dots will tick maybe 1 time, and yes thats even in icefall etc where mobs have lotsa hp.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;i know for one im a little peeved about the wizard instant nuke, if they are going to do that they should give everyone a instant cast spell.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;i was watching a wizard multi kite today not even snaring the mobs, and had the instant nukes chain critting for almost 15k.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;so, i want&amp;nbsp; instant dot that crits for a decent amount..&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;its only fair.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;These plant only spells make me wonder if the responsible spell dev ever played a Necro. What is the vision behind this? Are we now "Masters of the evil Garden"? I feel embarrassed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So far in normal group play I didn't use them, My 9 spellslots are filled with spells I can use all the time and when I see an incoming message about a plant ( never happened so far) I won't tell the puller to run a few more rounds so I can mem these spells. These spells might&amp;nbsp;have made&amp;nbsp;more sense when the plants would be immune to nonplant spells and/or when we had a jungle zone (hey, there is a lot of weed in this zone, let's get a gardenmancer into the group).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Maybe the soloing Necro is happy with a plant DoT, I don't know.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>The AoN/Epic 1.0 issue in Plane of Fear, Absor does not know about it</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Necromancers&amp;message.id=9244#M9244</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The Necromancer, Shaman and Shadow Knight Epic 1.0 quests require items from one of the four Plane of Fear Golems which also happen to drop the Bazaar money making item Amulet of Necropotence.&amp;nbsp; The Golems are killed on most servers as soon as they repop.&amp;nbsp; There is currently some friction between players seeking Epic 1.0 quest items and players seeking the Amulet of Necropotence.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There are no good guys and bad guys in this scenario even though many would argue so.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Nonetheless, The fact that this scenario exists is enough reason for it to be evaluated by the Everquest developers.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If a veteran developer like Absor does not know about it, perhaps more /feedback should be sent.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It might be a good idea to inform the Everquest designers through feedback and forum posting that a debate does exist as a first step towards some progress.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;amp;message.id=296858#M296858" target=_blank&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;amp;message.id=296858#M296858&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;KilljoyMcCoy wrote:&lt;BR&gt;Wow you fixed this whole thing in just 2 hours? Faction, quest givers, dialog, mobs, plus testing? Editing tables, making backups, verifiying, getting feedback from co-workers...I'm not being sarcastic, either.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;At that rate, you could crank out a fix for the SK/NEC/SHM epic roadblock / AoN permacamping problem in about 12 minutes. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Cut n' paste a similar encounter, change the mob names, zone names, turn in peices, reward...set the spawn spot, timer, and viola! Everyone is happy &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;It helped that I knew the zone set up and wrote most of the docs for the zone.&amp;nbsp; So no poking around figuring stuff out, that saved me a lot of the usual time.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Testing it wasn't too hard, and the actual data change was pretty simple.&amp;nbsp; Our QA department will look over the changes, and odds are they'll find something I missed and I'll have to fix that.&amp;nbsp; &lt;STRONG&gt;For something like the epic roadblock you mentioned, I don't know what it is, where it is or anything much about it.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; So just the research for it would take a while.&amp;nbsp; It's way easier to work on something you know about than something you've never touched.&amp;nbsp; In fact, probably the hardest part is figuring out if a change is even needed.&amp;nbsp; Since I knew what should have been going on in Icefall, I could tell from the post I read that something was wrong.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Figuring out IF something should change, what that change should be and how to bring about the change is often the longest part of anything we have to fix.&amp;nbsp; There's nothing worse than implementing the wrong fix (or a fix to a problem that wasn't really a problem).&amp;nbsp; Changing stuff you're familiar with cuts the exploration factor way down.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hey guys, Thanks a ton, for making the necro pet illusion spells so frggin hard to get, thats the only spells i (and im pretty sure alot of other necs) wanted from level 71.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;we are soooo sick of that lame spectre weve had for how long now???? the look the sound everything about it.. and you finally decide to be nice and let us get illusions for it then go and hide it somewhere.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;it would be nice if one of you could point us in a general direction.....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;ive ran all over finding every level 70+ task i could find, without success.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;and im already tired of doing noob quests cause it would be like you guys to put em on a quests 1+ npc....&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Odd bug with Cloak of Shadows vs Ranger Shared Camouflage</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Necromancers&amp;message.id=9226#M9226</link>
      <description>I noticed this last night while I was in Sunderrock Springs. I had zoned into Sunderrock Spring and clicked my Cloak of Shadows AA and was running to catch up with my group who were already in zone near the mine enterance.  I caught up with them and we all decided to move to a different location to fight in the zone.  I was still invisible but the rest of the group was not as they had previously been fighting before I arrived. The ranger clicked her Shared Camouflage AA to invis the rest of the group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We started to move to one of the cave areas when everything jumped me.  Now of course I feigned and the pet feigned, but everyone was puzzled as to why I was attacked?  Was it a see invis mob -- but why didn't it attack everyone else who ran by it first.  I waited for agro to clear, clicked CoS and stood up.  No agro.  I moved back to the group puzzled by what had happened.  So I called for an experiment being the inquisitive necromancer that I am.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone became visible.  I clicked my Cloak of Shadows AA; I was invisible.  Then the ranger clicked her Shared Camouflage AA.  Now the group was invisible.  I got the message "Ledora tries to cast an invisibility spell on you, but you are already invisible."  Suddenly, I was visible.  YIKES!!  So that's what caused it the attack earlier.  I didn't get time to check this with other invisibilities, but I thought I would share my results so far. (and yes, I /bug-ged it.)</description>

      <description>PLEASE repair Lich.&amp;nbsp; As a necro with almost 14k mana, 12400ish hp, and the new lich, I simply cannot cast the way I used to.&amp;nbsp; I will borrow from Prince's stats in another thread:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planes of Power:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

&lt;p&gt;Otherside recovery rate: 1min(780-19%), 3min(2,340-57%), 5min(3,900-96%)&lt;/p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Necros have always been able to sustain Damage OVER TIME, and currently I just cannot.&amp;nbsp; If high end necros server wide are suddenly going OOM in grps there is something dradtically wrong.&amp;nbsp; The cost of our new spells in mana means most of us simply cannot use them.&amp;nbsp; In order to even BEGIN to start using the new spells, the lich upgrade Overthere needs a massive boost to assist our mana regen.&amp;nbsp; We just cannot cast dots that cost over 1k mana with lich in its current form.&amp;nbsp; Our mana regen is insufficient.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compounding this is something truly and insidiously dangerous to the class, namely the discontinuation of the affliction efficiency line of spell focus.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; PLEASE restore this line to our class (and other casters to I imagine).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I am going to quote Jebasiz on this as he put it very well:&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In combat regen has always been the strength of necromancers(arguably&#xD;
shaman, but I'll take my passive ability anyday), therefore when we run&#xD;
OOM while grouping there's probably something wrong/out of whack.&amp;nbsp; If&#xD;
they're going to give us 1300 mana cost dots, they should give us regen&#xD;
enough to be able to sustain casting them for a greater period of&#xD;
time.&amp;nbsp; Right now, with the discontinuance of affliction efficiency for&#xD;
72+ spells, our DPM took an enormous hit.&amp;nbsp; There's no way(to my&#xD;
knowledge) to account for that 23%(typically) of affliction&#xD;
efficiency/mana savings per cast for dots 72+, which coincidently have&#xD;
some of the largest mana cost(sans dreadpyre which is our 2nd most&#xD;
costly spell).&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The DPM on our spells was not updated&#xD;
sufficiently for the removal of that preservation.&amp;nbsp; Also, our mana&#xD;
regen wasn't upgraded to compensate for our spell cost(even if AE was&#xD;
updated and continued to 75).&amp;nbsp; There's a big list of reasons why we're&#xD;
running out of mana..and it's not just me, other necros in high end&#xD;
guilds I've spoken with have said the same thing.&lt;br&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PLASE address these issues.&amp;nbsp; Necros all over the game are finding it impossible to keep up with the cost of casting our new spells, and it is pointless having a class resorting to casting lower level spells than the best available because of a design fault that makes us simply unable to cast them in the way we were meant to.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is not a call to nerf anyone, but other classes got significant upgrades in the way they regen mana.&amp;nbsp; Necros did NOT, and it is desperately needed.&amp;nbsp; Please re-examine this matter carefully and upgrade lich (or reduce mana costs), and return the mana preservation line that was previously affliction efficiency.&amp;nbsp; There are some pretty desperare players out there at the moment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Necromancers&amp;message.id=9245#M9245</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;hello, i was wandering if its at all possible to have our scent line swapped,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;IE: new scent of twilight, if we could have a line like scent of terris with a resist mod like this.&amp;nbsp; eg, swap resist mods on the 2 spells and upgrade the terris line instead of twilight types.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;please delete the other 2 posts i hit tab.&amp;nbsp; man i hate the tab on these posts.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Scent of Twilight</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Necromancers&amp;message.id=9195#M9195</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I was in BETA but I was never able to find a good place to see the spell data for our spells so I didn't bother to check up on Scent of Twilight.&amp;nbsp; It Debuffs DR/PR by 61 (Midnight is 55) and that's fine.&amp;nbsp; The problem is:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Scent of Twilight&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Slot Description&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1:&amp;nbsp; Increase Incoming Spell Damage by 3%&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2:&amp;nbsp;Decrease Disease Resist by 61&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3: Max Level(75)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;4: Limit: Effect(Hitpoints allowed)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5: &lt;FONT color=#cc0000&gt;Limit: Resist(Disease allowed)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;6: Decrease Poison Resist by 61&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;7: Limit: Spell Type(Detrimental only)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;8: Limit: Combat Skills Not Allowed&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;9: Increase Disease Counter by 18&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So, we can debuff a mob to increase the damage of disease nukes, which is a line of nukes that we don't have in this expansion?&amp;nbsp; Only Shamans and SK's have disease nukes.&amp;nbsp; Shouldn't this be Poison or Magic?&amp;nbsp; Shamans get one for Magic, Druids get one for Fire so this one should probably be Poison.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;OR, does this also affect dots?&amp;nbsp; In that case, this spell is almost as worthless since I never mem disease dots unless the raid named is resistant to everything else.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Is this intended for our stones, or is it just an unintended linking to the ones chanters have which poof when they die, as well?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dunno about y'all but most places I'm in where I'd be using mez have no plants or animals handy to make a new one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chanters simply summon theirs, so it's just a minor inconvenience for them.</description>

      <title>Lich IN combat - problems!!</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Necromancers&amp;message.id=9184#M9184</link>
      <description>Has anyone else noticed that when casting (I am using our 70 spells so&#xD;
as not to make a huge dent in mana with the new spells and a lack of&#xD;
focus gear etc) - our lich does not seem to regen mana as fast as&#xD;
before?&amp;nbsp; When kiting, for example, if we need to we can sit down&#xD;
when the mob is a fair way away and just med up for a tick or&#xD;
two.&amp;nbsp; Now though, we are still IN combat.&amp;nbsp; Lich just does not&#xD;
seem to be returning the same amount of mana as it did before.&amp;nbsp; It&#xD;
is bad enough that it doesn't stack with OOC mana regen, but for it to&#xD;
not work when in combat seems harsh.&amp;nbsp; If it is just me, I hope to&#xD;
find out...I did a /bug on it.&amp;nbsp; If it is everyone in the necro&#xD;
class then this is serious.&amp;nbsp; I just cannot cast like I used&#xD;
to.&amp;nbsp; Anyone else finding this with their usual spells?&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
Please test it out and see what results you get, problems&amp;nbsp; (or&#xD;
triumphs) etc.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
