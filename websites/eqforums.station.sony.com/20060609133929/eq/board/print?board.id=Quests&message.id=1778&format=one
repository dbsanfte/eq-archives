<DIV>The task does not update when you hail him. Ceridan waves at you when you hail him, but does not say anything.</DIV>

<P>I was also able to run through this task successfully on Test as well.&nbsp; If anyone is still running into this issue can you let me know what class you're playing? <STRONG>Thanks to everyone who said about climbing over the counter. He obviously waves at you to say come closer I can't hear you.</STRONG></P>
<P>The text issues in the Into Befallen task have been corrected as well.&nbsp; The task window will begin asking you to return to Freeport instead of Qeynos after the next update. <STRONG>Thanks</STRONG></P>

<DIV>Which changes are preventing you from getting the quest again? <STRONG>I now understand this. Once you complete the "Journey to Freeport" (or wherever) task for each item of armour, you are flagged for having got that piece and you can no longer get either of the two tasks (V'Lynn Renloe or Barrenzin version) again</STRONG>. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>The exception is the group tasks, which I think you can do as many times as you want.</STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>Therefore although the bracers are not lore, the only way to get two bracers is to get the task for the second one before handing in the trial note for the first one. </STRONG></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>It would be nice if it only flagged you for doing the task you actually did, as you could then do V'Lynn Renloe's task for your first bracer, and then do Barrenzin's task for your second bracer.</STRONG></DIV>
