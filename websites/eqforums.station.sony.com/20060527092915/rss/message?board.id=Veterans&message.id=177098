      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dain MM arc was very good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does this arc provide a storytelling kind of element (which highly encouraged roleplaying as I've found), the missions were very interestingly designed.  Three different missions that required three completely different strategies to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Took me and company about 6 or so tries to nail down how to finish Dain 3, but the 1st time that we won was no less fun than the 1st time that we tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also it enriches the perspectives that have already been built on from the beginning about Velious - That it wasn't exactly all a happy jolly place on ice - The different peoples there are pretty bitter about each other and the storyies that these missions tell just brings all that to life.  Good job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If only all the other MM's could be made to have these elements, that would make my day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I dont know if it is intentional or not but if someone fails the 10th ring war in GD all of thurg depops, including the dain mm mission giver.  While it makes sense that if thurg was over run there wouldn't be a mission giver alive for anyone to do the mission it might suck if you started the mission and accidentally left the mission only to find out you can't return.   I just thought I would post that.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all those that don't like the fact that &amp;quot;MM newbs&amp;quot; dont' know their class, and blah blah blah, I have a suggestion: Why don't they add the MM exp rewards to the end of an LDoN? The level restrictions are still there, so it's not quite the same as a regular MM, but I think more people would go back to LDoNs if they got both the exp from the dungeon, then an AA for completing it in time as well. They would have to fix other issues with LDoNs to make it viable to the 70s crowd, but it's generally not the 70s crowd complaining about catching up using MMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I agree and understand with the re-tuning needed in High Hold Pass, the MM itself is now not worth the time required to do it.  It would be beneficial to see it evaluated for time spent versus reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was talk, at one time, of real time synchronization for experience in MMs.  Has this been approached as a real possibility?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I usually do not post in threads like this, but I wanted to relay something regarding MMs that no one seems to notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some DO require some thought in completing, especially since many of the missions have been nerfed.  Let me give you an example of the last mission I did:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the DAIN 1 mission from Icewell..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to take out three different cheiftains, kill 8 wolves, and take out the warlord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first chietain is relatively easy, no problem there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second chieftain required we figure out a way to split the camp such that Dain can successfully kill the chieftain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thrid Chieftain: Same thing.  Gotta figure out how to split the mobs so Dain can kill the Chieftain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wolves are easy, nothing learned there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warlord:  Now here, this guy has a serious knockback spell that will blast your 50 yards away.  What I learned was that in order to avoid the terrible knockback, you have to position yourself with your back against the vertical wall behind the warlord.  Then when he pops you with that knockback, you don't go very far.,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you DO learn skills that serve you in other content.  You just have to look for those little pearls where you can.  :-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

You have some of the best known Dragons on Velious fear kiting (way hinky and sad for them to behave like that) and running away from puny giants for pete's sakes! Even the dev working on it (Absor) says it needs more work... The Sleeper is annoying and badly tuned and should not be mentioned with the same same breath of the much better designed (and better RvR) Dain missions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MMs being designed by various devs and in some cases by committee / nerf battage are of wildly varying quality.&lt;br&gt;BTW, while the overtuned HHK MM is for all intents and purposes dead - there are still other MMs that can be done fast and easily given a good crew. You just don't hear about them as they are rightly kept under the radar (go explore and try em!). Unlike the HHK mission which just became too egregious and &amp;quot;famous&amp;quot; for its own good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Why not place a level restriction for the DoD MMs? Just like the Creator. If someone earned their way up the ladder and gained levels in excess of 65 or so should not be penalized for some peoples actions i.e. leveling a toon so fast that they are a &amp;quot;paper tank&amp;quot;, have no weapon or magic skills, and cost others their lives. I beg of you, please unnerf the DoD mms and just put a level requirement on them. This way, those that earn it, get the opportunity to better themselves with aa's. There are members that have gotten several hundred aa's from the mm's. Nothing wrong with that. So please either place a level requirement on the mm's or make them strictly for aa's. I strongly miss doing the Highpass mission. But that was nerfed rediculously. Now noone is doing the DoD mms anymore. So please, please, please unnerf the DoD mms.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The DoD MMs were not nerfed? Then can you tell me how many are actually doing them since the NERF? Get real, Sony has bowed down the a select few that for one reason or another that despise MMs. Don't like 'em? Don't do them. Period. But for all of you whining and crying about the DoDs, and for Sony who obviously listens to those cries, keep up the good work. Don't be suprised if all you you whiners out there sign on one day and find something you like taken out of the game. But you guys are doing awesome, so please continue the whine, cry, **SMURF**, moan fest. Oh, but just make sure you penalize the rest of us in the process. Thanks again.</description>

But for all of you whining and crying about the DoDs, and for Sony who obviously listens to those cries, keep up the good work. Don't be suprised if all you you whiners out there sign on one day and find something you like taken out of the game. But you guys are doing awesome, so please continue the whine, cry, **SMURF**, moan fest. Oh, but just make sure you penalize the rest of us in the process. Thanks again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;/agree&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try finding a group to go along on the DoD MM's. There are tons of MM's that I would love to try but now no one plays them, why? NERFED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yep, the 1% loudmouthed few ruin the fun for the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are not unpopular because they were nerfed. They are unpopular because they had to have exagerated rewards to get people to play them. Now that the exagerated rewards are gone, we see that they are really boring! Something lots of us were saying from day 1! Thank goodness they got rid of the silly rewards. However we'll see if EQ can recover from all the damage that it did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Every single Depths of Darkhollow monster mission was nerfed? No, sir. They were not. A few were tuned, but not nerfed.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As for noone playing them, maybe my server is just special, but I am able to easily put together groups for monster missions, both DoD and PoR, by /ooc'ing in PoK, asking in channels like General or NewPlayers and sending tells to people who have /lfg. I can regularly get a group for Nagafen in 5 minutes or less. Some of the less well known missions take a bit longer, but there are still tons of people who are willing to do them. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As for the loudmouthed few, you're again not quite correct, friend. The loudmouthed few had nothing to do with it. Some missions were broken or untuned and needed to be fixed. They were fixed, not nerfed, but are still plenty of fun.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Which server are you on I would love to come and watch you put a MM group together in 5mins or less.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;I think the better question though, is what server are YOU on? I'll make a toon there and get you a group for Nagafen in 5 minutes.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As far as the Nerfing goes if there had not been a very vocal group of players complaining about how the mysterious lvl 70 newbies were ruining the game I believe the MM's would have been left alone. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;It had nothing to do with people complaining (though I agree with you, people complaininng about "OMG! MM newbs are ruining my game" sound pretty silly). It had to do with the fact that when a mission is designed to take 45 minutes, and gives a reward appropriate for that, and people beat it in 20 minutes, the mission isn't working the way it was intended and is probably going to get fixed.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>I managed to get an MM group tonight.&lt;br&gt;The naggy mission.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wanted to show an old-timer how cool the mission was.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, we finished it, but 2 people didn't get to loot the experience shard before we got kicked out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sweet!&lt;br&gt;Love it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I recommend adding one more step to the objectives of this mission:&lt;br&gt;* coordinate shard-looting - you must be fast!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or.. how about increasing the amount of time after the win before you get booted to lavastorm?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first looter did loot the gloves first.. does looting the gloves start the timer? It must, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can't imagine having the time to roll on the chest loot at the end of the mission in the 20 seconds we got to loot the shards.</description>
