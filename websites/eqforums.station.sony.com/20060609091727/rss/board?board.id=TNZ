&lt;DIV&gt;The Rules:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- The Game master (the one who won the last game) selects a person (NPC), place, or thing in-game related.&lt;BR&gt;- Players then ask yes or no questions, to try to uncover the secret person/place/thing; however Game masters do have the right to go beyond a simple yes or a no answer if necessary. (For example, "I'm not sure‚Äù or "Probably" or "Yes, but be careful because that's misleading." )&lt;BR&gt;- Please ask only one question per post.&lt;BR&gt;- A player may ask a new question as soon as his or her last question has been answered.&lt;BR&gt;- The Game masters should post recaps of answers from time to time- once a page is a good idea.&lt;BR&gt;- Once a person guesses the object, he or she gets to host the next game, or can designate someone else to host it. Make a separate thread, and we'll let this one die. That way we can better keep track of when one game begins and another ends. Keep numbering the games as we go along.&lt;BR&gt;- If a player wins and does not start up another game within 24 hours of winning, the last person to guess before him or her gets to host the next game.&lt;BR&gt;- If the game master does not respond within 24 hours to any posts then anyone may feel free to start the next round.&lt;BR&gt;- The answer may or may not be...a shrubbery! Ni!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Keeping track of previous games here is a list of the answers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1. Maiden's Fancy in Neriak&lt;BR&gt;2.

      <description>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I asked this in another thread, but no one seemed to notice, so I guess I'll start a new thread about it.&amp;nbsp; The formatting isn't quite right because I just sort of copied and&#xD;
pasted my exact post in another&amp;nbsp; thread, but if you can't tell, I'm&#xD;
quoting Rashere and asking a question about it:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rashere wrote:&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The main point in the change was to start introducing death&#xD;
penalties while players are still in the relatively safe area of&#xD;
Gloomingdeep.&amp;nbsp; The penalties start out really low, though, and you lose&#xD;
next to no experience at level 6.&amp;nbsp; It slowly goes up from there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Rashere&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyone know how&#xD;
"fast/slow" it "ramps" up?&amp;nbsp; And is max exp loss still 1/2 a yellow&#xD;
(atleast I think that's what it was before I quit a year and a half ago&#xD;
or so ...)?&amp;nbsp; And what lvl do you hit "max exp loss per death"?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;With how baren many zones are these days.&amp;nbsp; A thought came to mind that could be kinda interesting.&amp;nbsp; All zones are based upon levels.&amp;nbsp; Wouldn't it be kinda fun to have a zone that is&amp;nbsp;a hotspot for levels of 20-70.&amp;nbsp; Various level of mobs in certain parts of the zone as well as making a challenge with some high level trash that roam?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I saw the thread "Thoughts on the Guild Hall" and realized that I know&#xD;
nothing about it.&amp;nbsp; That was part of an expansion that came out&#xD;
while I was on Hiatus.&amp;nbsp; I think it is in PoK but I know nothing&#xD;
else about it.&amp;nbsp; Could somebody fill me in on what is there and&#xD;
what can be done with it???&amp;nbsp; I am totally clueless about&#xD;
this.&amp;nbsp; (I know this is not an unusual situation&amp;nbsp; &lt;span&gt;:smileytongue:&lt;/span&gt; )&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;While I enjoy greatly the added features that the Guild Hall has made available to me, I feel that there is potential there that is not being tapped.&amp;nbsp; With that in mind, I wanted to throw out a few suggestions for additional features that could be added to the Guild Hall, and see what anyone thought about them, or if anyone else had any ideas.&amp;nbsp; I will admit that I did not do an extensive search on Guild Hall threads before posting this, so if any of these suggestions have been discussed before, I apologize.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Guild Armory - &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Basically a room with various display racks/storage containers that hold Equipable Items that are donated by guild members.&amp;nbsp; This would differ from the Guild Bank in a few key ways.&amp;nbsp; Only Equipable Items can be donated and/or borrowed.&amp;nbsp; Once Items are donated, they become Guild property, and remain such for the life of the Guild. Items can be borrowed from the Armory for single sessions (as though they were Temporary) and upon camping any Armory items that have not been returned are automatically transferred back into the Armory.&amp;nbsp; Similarly if a character has any Armory items borrowed when they leave the Guild, all such items are transferred back to the Armory at that time.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Combat Trainer - &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Since Casters have the capability of using the Pool in the Hall for doing casting skill training, have something set up for Melee classes.&amp;nbsp; What I thought of was a room in which there is a Gnome Tinkerer who you could Hail to request Training.&amp;nbsp; At that time he would spawn a clockwork MOB of some time that would be Dark Blue or White to the character who requested training.&amp;nbsp; This spawned MOB would have 0 XP - an important point - but by being Dark Blue or White would be one that would allow for melee skillups.&amp;nbsp; The MOB would instantly Aggro on the character who requested training.&amp;nbsp; Combat would ensue as normal, with the caveat that there could be some 'safety phrase' that you could say to the Gnome to call off the clockwork.&amp;nbsp; Since the danger of dying would exist, it would prevent players from spawning the MOB, initiating the combat, and walking off.&amp;nbsp; This way melee classes would have a way on working on their melee skills in a manner that would require player interaction, but with the reqard limited to skills to balance the safe aspect of such training.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Archery Range - &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Similar to what was just described for the Melee skills, have a room set up with an NPC that sells low level archery and throwing amunition, and have targetable items (bales of hay, stuffed manequins, etc) that could be attacked with ranged weapons for a chance at a skill up.&amp;nbsp; It would be necessary to disable the /autofire feature in this room, so that player involvement would be required to engage in the training.&amp;nbsp; One additional option would be to have some type of moving items that would have a greater difficulty to hit, but a higher percentage chance of a skill up for a successful hit.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Just&amp;nbsp;a few thoughts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Not sure if this is just a rumor or what, but heard that EQ is going to eventually be raising it's monthly price to nearly $25. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Was wondering if anyone else had heard this and if it may be true.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>In looking at Allakhazams spell lists for my upcoming levels I've&#xD;
noticed that&amp;nbsp; several of them are only purchaseable from a vendor&#xD;
in the Abysmal Sea.&amp;nbsp; I have found that I can get there from&#xD;
Nederias Landing but I was wondering how?&amp;nbsp; I will probably be&#xD;
going as a level 36 or 37 Druid so I was curious about how dangerous&#xD;
the zone is and how difficult&amp;nbsp; the vendor (Verna Leinar) is to&#xD;
find?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
You can get to Nederias Landing via the Wayfarers camps, right?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;So, i jsut started playing EQ since a little over a year. Obviously things are different and one thing that really stuck out is when i logged on the other day it said i could claim some items so i did and it was pretty cool, but what is all this about? Do you get to claim items a certain amount of times and if you do when or do you have to do something special to get them? and just something even further on the topic, i recieved some gargoyle tooth, and im wondering what to do with it, because its obviously something you hand in.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Is there *any* chance for this?&amp;nbsp; They've proven they're smart enough to be Necromancers, is it that much of a stretch to allow them to be Wizards?&amp;nbsp; Or is it the racial benefits that would make them "overpowered" as Wizards?&amp;nbsp; I personaly love playing Iksar and would just like another caster option for the race and Wizard seems like the best fit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I haven't played EQ in about 3 years now and I have some questions regarding the Monster Missions.&amp;nbsp; I would really like to do some of these as they sound fun and the items you recieve aren't too bad, but I don't know all of the rules regarding these.&amp;nbsp; I know that you have to have a group of atleast 3 people to do them and that they CAN take up to 6 hours to complete, but that is all I know.&amp;nbsp; Things I don't know and can't seem to find answers to anywhere are: 1) Can you do these at any level?, 2) Do they follow the 10 level rule for grouping or can you have various levels attend?, 3) Do you loot items off of dead mobs and if so do you get to keep the loot?, 4) Is there somewhere I can go to get a complete rundown on how these things work?, 5) anything else that I haven't thought of to ask, but might be useful.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Anyone ever come across this bug?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=TNZ&amp;message.id=244720#M244720</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hello newbie zone &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Recently I took a break from the game, On my return I wanted to get reaquainted with the friends I have made in our family guild that I have been a part of for about 2 years now. I had learned though that one of the best friends I had made since joining the guild had been having some account troubles and might not be able to play for awhile. So yesterday I phoned him and he let me know the story. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I guess about three months ago, He was into mainly doing tradeskills focusing on tailoring, He was at the bank in pok, Switching items and whatnot around and somehow he was able to put a mage rod into his shared bank slot. I guess then his account was immediatly flagged as using a third party program to swtich no drop items. So he was banned. Now there has been a ton of emails back and forth with sony's CS and he has finnally been given his account back although all his toons will be naked and pennieless. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now during the investigation if sony really even did one. He's asked them to check their logs to see if any other no drop&amp;nbsp;items have been switched besides the mage rod that was in the shared bank slot. He's asked them why he would even need a program like that as really his gear is not that great and really what would he need to switch as his main is a 68 ranger and his next toon implicated is a 60 druid. Those were the only two toons logged in while the mod rod was in shared bank. Most of what he will be losing by coming back&amp;nbsp;naked is a ton of tradeskill components for smithing, fletching, and tailoring none of which were no drop. He has lost also three peices of gm armor with symbols on his ranger and he had his epic one both swords. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now I can in no way believe he would use a program like that. I've come to know him quite we'll over the years since I've joined the guild. He's not a power type gamer that needs the best stuff and will do anything to aquire it&amp;nbsp;and he takes pride in the fact that hes built up his toon's gear and skills the right way through just plain hard work. He's always been the first also to drop whatever hes doing to come to a guildies aid, heck&amp;nbsp;he pretty much drops what hes doing to help anyone in need. He's a much better person than I am. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am a bit scared that this will completly turn him off the game for good and I think our server would be a lesser place without someone like him, he's been a customer now of soe for 6 years with never a single bit of trouble&amp;nbsp;and has told me that His experience with their CS department has been not so good.&amp;nbsp; Basically they could not care one way or the other and they basically said&amp;nbsp;he should feel lucky he's even getting his account back at all.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So now the guild core will basically be pulling hard to get him regeared. I can help a lot there as I am a tradeskiller myself and pretty much keep all the components to gear up any class decently, but that's not the point If he did no wrong. I feel that he should almost have some type indepentent investigation to prove he is not guilty. All I know is I would be bitter enough to quit if all this happened to me and the final icing on the cake has been that since he was banned he lost all his prepaid subscription for eq. I think mostly what will bring him back to play though as that in our guild we have a pretty close friendship with one another and he misses that. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So has anyone heard of a bug like this or experienced it first hand?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
