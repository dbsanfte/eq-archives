    <description>&lt;div&gt;I have just rolled a warrior and have dinged 16. I currently have a 64 Ranger and that has been my only toon thus far.   I would like to twink my warriro out a little bit and my question is in regards to gear.  I have about 50k to spend.  Are there any must have items that have good stats and dont have a required level?  Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks!  Also, i have about 1600hp with temp - is that good?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I'm a 53 Warrior and transitioning from Magentic to PoP/GoD armor. First thing to get should be armor. About the best and that will take you into you 50s and 60s is Magnetic. Magnetic Armor is player crafted only.  Here is a link to Allakhazam'a listing for Magnetic http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/searchdb.html?iname=magnetic. Recommend you buy in order the Breastplate, Leggings, Gauntlets, and Helm and then the charm if you want. You can get the boots and the Bracers for a full set, but I recommend Boots of the Slavetrader has better stats than the Magnetic boots. As for the ARMS slot I had Bracelet of Might and Bracelet Quickness or get a bracelet that will raise you AGI or STA as needed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for weapons do not waste you money on anything that procs, wait and save until your level is near that of the proc. To me, the best all around Old World warrior weapons would be; 1HS, Copper Hammer of Striking (proc 50) and Sword of the Bloodsworn (proc 40), 2HS Sword of the Crypt Creeper (proc 35). You can get a Blade of Carnage (proc 45) or a Split Blade of Destruction (no proc) when you are able to use them to their fullest and might be able to afford them. They are expensive in the bazaar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can you get all this for 50Kpp, No, but you can buy the rest after the breastplate, leggings, gauntlets/helm. None of these will be full stats for you, but each will grow as you level. To the point where your AC will be around 1200 when you are a 51 and higher.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remember, as a warrior you are only concerned with, in order, STR, DEX, STA, AGI and your saves. The higher each of these are the better. Good Luck and welcome to the most equipment dependent class in EQ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Make friends with Clerics...&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
