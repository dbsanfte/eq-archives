    <title>A Forage Filter System?</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Trade&amp;message.id=9630</link>
    <description>Sony's new expansion is going to introduce a buff filtering system, which got me to thinking why not a foraging filtering system? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I play a 70 druid with a foraging skill that has been long maxed out at 200. Once forage gets to 200 you never NOT forage anything. I've also invested AAs in all three levels of Nature's Bounty, an AA ability that gives me a chance to forage two things at once. Since I'm currently working on my baking and brewing skills, I find foraging to be an invaluable tool.  I also love being able to help out my guildmates who need foraged items for their tradeskills and can't forage themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, as you can imagine I often find myself foraging a LOT of worthless stuff that I don't need. Rabbit meat, roots, fishing grubs, myriad of different pounds of meat in GoD zones, tradeskill items that my friends and I no longer need, etc.  The most annoying to me are epic forages I keep making when passing through those zones for an epic that I completed years ago.  Anyway, I'd love for there to be a way to filter out items that I no longer want to forage and would have just destroyed anyway.  This doesn't mean I want to be able to get nothing but rare forages (some forages are made purposely rare I'm sure ~sighs and wishes she could get more air-infused water~)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What I had in mind was a filtering system that would essentially allow me to select items I no longer want to keep when I forage. In the event that I forage an item on the DO NOT WANT list, I would instead get a message: "You have foraged something on your filter list, so it has automatically be destroyed."  (Or since I'm a roleplayer I'd love to see a message more along the lines of, "You have foraged something that you no longer want, so you have discarded it."). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, I think this would be a very useful tool for foragers, though I have a feeling it's not useful enough for the population on the whole for Sony to take the time to implement. (Druids and rangers are the ones that would benefit from this the most I think and they hardly make up a majority although bards and certain races can forage some too). Nevertheless I thought I'd bring the idea out here to see what others thought. :) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Right before I decided to post this, I did a search to see if this idea had been brought up recently. Someone did come up with this exact same idea almost as year and half ago, but most message boards frown on resurrecting old threads so I thought I’d go ahead and start a new topic as planned.

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;if your sick of your forage toons getting backpacks full of junk, just fill all your empty slots with&amp;nbsp;a single item&amp;nbsp;of the items you want.&amp;nbsp; you'll retain the free space to get stacks and stacks of the item you want, while letting the suk forages fall to the ground.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;A forage filter defeats the purpose of forage. What you get is supposed to be random, and some items are meant to be rarer than others and are supposed to take a long time to find. If you could just walk into a zone, forage, and pick out what you wanted the foraged item to be from a list, of course everyone would go for the rares and before you know it, every tradeskiller in the game has items that are supposed to crop up only a few times a year for sale in bazaar and the economy for those items is basically ruined because of all the competition driving prices down. It is the randomness and rareness of certain forages that makes them worth looking for. A forage filter would destroy that by making rare items common.</description>

Say I'm in East Karana, and only want tea leaves, with everything else on the forage filter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I forage. Get a pod of water. It's automatically destroyed, with a message saying something akin to "You foraged a pod of water, but tossed it away since it's not what you're after."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I forage again, and get a plains pebble, which is then tossed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only time an item actually appears on my curser, would be when it's a tea leaf. Or whatever I haven't blocked. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The chance of getting items you don't want will still be there, but this way we dont' have to constantly be destroying things, or dropping things, or having no drop, non-stackable items we dont' want taking up inventory. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Oh, ok. I thought the original poster meant to make a forage filter like track filter where you get a list of everything that is foragable in the zone and select what you want your successful forages to contain with no chance of foraging anything else, although, it really makes no sense because you have to wait for forage to recycle before you can use it again anyway, and how long does it really take to hit the destroy button when something you don't want appears on your cursor?</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Oops ended my post too soon. I think this forage filter stuff sounds like a way for someone to set up a forage bot using Autofire! or some such illegal program to gather rare forages without taking up inventory space, and for that reason alone, I think SoE won't do it.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I would love to see this filter.&amp;nbsp; In fact, I would also like to see a similar filter for fishing.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
The argument that it would be a bad idea because it *might* help people&#xD;

When I'm on my druid, I have my forage hotkey set to forage when I turn left or right, and to auto inventory whatever it is I forage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It gets annoying when I've been in say, CS for awhile, and go to loot a mob, only to find my inventory is full of those no drop, unstackable shells. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I know there will always be cheaters but it does sound as if you are asking Sony to sanction the use of forage bots by allowing them to only retain the items specified by the player. It would be nice to log your forage bot on and never have to worry about picking up a piece of junk. It is the fact that you can end up with backpacks full of garbage that prevents many players from creating forage bots. I still say something like this is better for the cheaters than for the honest players and Sony won't do it because if they did, they would open the floodgates and everyone would create a forage bot knowing that they would always have packs full of only the things they need when they return.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Making rare forages easier to accumulate in bulk would make them not worth looking for anymore as everybody will have tons of them. If Sony gives you your forage filter today, tomorrow you'll be complaining about the collapse of the economy in foraged items because the bazaar is flooded with them.&lt;br&gt;</description>

If Sony gives you your forage filter today, tomorrow you'll be complaining about the collapse of the economy in foraged items&amp;nbsp;because the bazaar&amp;nbsp;is flooded with them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's the thing Vegeta. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The forage filter wouldn't make things any easier for the cheaters, since they can &lt;b&gt;already&lt;/b&gt; do this. I could point you to the macro itself, if it weren't against board policy. And it's not difficult to do either. The instructions are laid out in laymen's terms, so that even a novice at computers could do it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

If Sony is going to start giving you the tools as part of the game that they currently ban, it makes their position concerning cheaters weaker and encourages more players to take a chance. I imagine many will get caught right away, but the cleverest ones will always find ways to cover their tracks and this game has enough cheaters as it is and doesn't need anymore because Sony showed signs of weakness by allowing certain portions of banned macros, eventually leading to the entire banned macro, into the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Because destroying foraged items isn't cheating.&amp;nbsp; Using a third-party program to change gameplay is cheating.&amp;nbsp; Over the game-life, SoE has made&amp;nbsp;gameplay easier.&amp;nbsp; The object of third-party programs is to make gameplay easier.&amp;nbsp; Obviously there will be some overlap.&amp;nbsp; In game maps, group members on maps, find path PC (aka, non-tracking-class-track-skill), autofire, are all gameplay easing abilities that SoE has introduced.&amp;nbsp; Before and after them there have always been calls to make gameplay easier.&amp;nbsp; It's not necessarily only to do with the fact that there are third-party programs that do similar things.</description>

&lt;P&gt;I think this sounds like a reasonable request.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;They added the buff-block filter to filter out unwanted buffs.&amp;nbsp; They implemented the /autoinv feature, making a forage macro even possible.&amp;nbsp; They have even stated that devices such as the programmable GamePad or keyboard are "legal" to use, so what's the&amp;nbsp;real argument against this?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As for autoforaging, we have this already and people do it all the time, it's just&amp;nbsp;if you do it while AFK (like, overnight while you sleep) that you risk&amp;nbsp;bannination.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If something like this were implemented then I'd like the ability to choose on an item-by-item basis which items to destroy and which to simply drop on the ground.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>I think this filter sounds like a wonderful idea! And is frankly one of the first suggestions for improvement I've read on these boards that didn't start out with a whiney &amp;quot;Everybody sucks, this game is too hard!&amp;quot; wha-wha intro. This would be a tremendous tool. I love foraging but it would sure be slick to not have to constantly be destroying unwanted items. This doesn't strike me as a game change in any way, just an interface improvement that would actually add to the realism. If you were walking and picked up an item you didn't want, you wouldn't have to put it in your bag and then take it out and then be asked &amp;quot;are you sure you want to destroy your rabbit meat&amp;quot; before you could finally chuck it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I remember the idea, and it is something that I will consider asking for (this is a code change, so not something I can do)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I can definitely make no promises though because as you say, it does not necessarily hit a large cross-section of the community.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I mostly wanted you to know that I do read and consider&amp;nbsp;community suggestions, and don't want the ideas&amp;nbsp;to stop just because they are not all implemented :)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
