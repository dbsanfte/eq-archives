    <description>I was thinking that there was a movie made that ran minute for minute, and I found a &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113972/" target=_blank&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; for it. I think 24 would lose a lot of it's draw to just be anothr action movie. That said, I haven't watched this season after the first couple of episodes as I think they have gone to shock value over storyline. However season 3 started the same and I enjoyed it when it got going, but I just can't relate to the characters any more, too many changes and not enough time to build up any affinity to them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Apparantly &lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/story/arts/national/2006/06/08/24-movie-variety.html" target=_blank&gt;a deal&lt;/a&gt; has been made to make a 24 movie. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to do it though they'll be dropping the 1 hour = 1 hour format of the show. (which makes sense, doubt many would want to watch a 24 hour movie)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It'll be interesting to see how well it does; if it can survive breaking its 'gimmick' on the big screen and last solely on its characters and settings. (No confirmation that Jack would be in it, but that's pretty much a given)</description>

      <description>*G* Some Time compression would be needed without a doubt. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lets see, for a mass market movie, I'd say the longest they'd be able to safely push it would be 3 hours. So that means you'd need to squeeze 8 hours worth into an hour screen time. (Directors Cut DVD could extend it to 4 hours though). That's only 8 minutes per hour; I can't really see them doing that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;on the other hand, 24 is also more or less designed to be 2 12 hour blocks, so how about 2 movies, one at the start of summer, the second at the end of summer. Then you're looking at about 4 hours per hour film time, can end on the sudden twist when you discover the big plot wasn't as big as you thought it was and leave people waiting for the end of summer for the conclusion. Maybe the directors cut of the DVD's could even extend it to a full 24 hour season, though that would mean a LOT would be cut (entire sub plots would have to be written/designed to be only included in the DVD)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You know, that might work really well, though it seems gimmicky to say the least. On the other hand, this is Hollywood we're talking about so I guess it's just gonna be your standard action movie fare anyways.</description>

      <description>Why even worry about following "real time"?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;If the plot etc is good, who cares?&amp;nbsp; On a side note, I recently recoreded the prequel to Twin Peaks, the movie "Fire Walk With Me" and have been watching a half hour or so here and tehre over the pasat few days, it has a younger Kiefer Sutherland......also Chris Isaak, David Bowie, very interesting andf typically weird David Lynch flick&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
