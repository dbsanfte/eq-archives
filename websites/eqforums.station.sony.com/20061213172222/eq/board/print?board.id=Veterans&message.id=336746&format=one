<P>So far, I am really enjoying my "away from EQ while this bug persists" time, my little gnome warlock is now in his mid teen levels. Also it has been awesome to really be only 2 clicks away from a game, rather than 2 clicks, and close to a minute waiting for a game.</P>
<P>Also no zoning, eventhough the seperate zones (by map) are easily as large as everquest zones. The voidwalker is a really nice pet though I must admit, I like the look of my warder more than his look, but at least this warlock I can heal without going splut, so at the moment the warlock is a hell of a lot more fun to play than the beastlord.</P>
<P>Ahh, well 7 more free trials days left, before I decide which subscription to continue, surely they'll have fixed this issue before that, so I can go back to my good old troll, I do miss his crack (And not talking about Spiritual Ascendance either) ;-p</P>
