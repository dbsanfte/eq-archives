    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I know it she is a hard to pin down woman at best! But anyway, I always thought she was a dark elf cleric guild master , who had the power to change into a high elf, and as such had infiltrated the Arcane Scientists.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I know she is (was?) the wizard guildmaster, and had also read that she is (was?) the actual head of the Arcane Scientists. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;(I got this from Alla mainly)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But now according to the Story Window she is just the librarian, and not only that but she is now an enchanter!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Well I guess if she can be a cleric and a wizzie she can be an enchanter. And I guess she could have also been demoted down to librarian (ook?) but I wonder why this wasn't worthy of note in the story window?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Have I missed something? I know she is pretty tricky to pin down!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Opal study and practices many forms of magic. There are a handful of npc's in lore who were adpt in serval&amp;nbsp; and a coupele who were able to practice all arts of magic. Opal may be very intelligent and powerful magically but she is vile and petty and comes off as desperate. druzzil seems to think her a joke and quickly put her in her place</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Going from the story window it was made out as if she was the kind of person who takes credit for others work.&amp;nbsp; Building from this appearance it could very well be that she simply claims to be able to do all of that but not have the actual ability to actually accomplish them.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is an oddity, but here is a short explaination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is really the Dark Elf Cleric Guildmaster in East Freeport, she uses a disguise (possibly an artifact) to pose as a High Elf Wizard in the Arcane Scientists. As her disguise has people fooled, it causes different faction hits for her &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; version, who actually has other motives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some are suspiscious of her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has the leader of Steel Warriors under an enchantment, and he obsesses over her, much to the worry of other Steel Warriors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opal has strong ties to Dismal Rage. Her cheif enemies are Arcane Scientists and Knights of Truth (DE form) and she is allied to the Freeport Militia. Likely her disguise in the Arcane Scientists is to use it for her own purposes, or bring it down from the inside, she may have been the instigater to a number of things that have occured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the Arcane Sciences comprises several schools of magic, it's conceivable that the position of Librarian could indeed be the leadership role, as the library would encompase all the joint schools, and one would have to do considerable research to keep in pace with all the schools. Likely thought there is no real head in Arcane Sciences and each school has a seperate leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That being the case she may at best be a go-between, I think it's far more likely that she is simply amitious and constantly seeking power. Sje likely holds enfluence and makes deals with everyone, manipulating people etc. Which in some quarters might be seen as being the big leader, heh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by KAhm on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;05-12-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;08:40 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Kahm is kind of exaggerating.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm not really sure of Opal Darkbriar's motives - she's a dark elf in the Dismal Rage, and is also in high elf form in West Freeport.&amp;nbsp; Saying that Cain Darkmoore is under "an enchantment" is also baseless, and isn't necessarily true.&amp;nbsp; Cain Darkmoore is deeply infatuated with her, and other Steel Warriors aren't "concerned", one's jealous, and one's jealous of the other's jealousy, it's not like she's manipulating the Steel Warriors as far as I'm aware.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As for her position, she's just a librarian, I wouldn't assume she's very important at all.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

There are a couple of incidents in Arcane Sciences that I would be suspect of, considering who she is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One is the theft of Marr Minnows from the knights of Truth. Someone in Arcane Sciences calims to want a fish as a sample to see if it can be introduced to the waters of their buildings. Sounds reasonable, except that the theft gives you a faction boost with Dismal Rage, as Opal in the science buildings is with Dismal Rage it suggests she may be behind that action and therefore possibly behind any number of other actions as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also her position as Librarian may (I am speculating) allow her to borrow resources and information used for studying magic for other Dismal Rage members, since Dismal Rage also trains Necromancers and evil casters in the city.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I don't think she even acknowledges Cain's existence, I asked her every possible question concerning Cain, and I didn't get any response.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I believe she's just a semi attractive high elf when in that form, and he dots her, much to the rage of a fellow Steel Warrior who's infatuated with him.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In old EQ, not every quest was necessarily one of "epic" proportions, and a lot were usually just flavor stories to flesh out the characters - which is equally important to epic quests.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;WTH Tornicade?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just pointed out that someone said she had Cain under an enchantment. The person who said that has no credit, I know, and I would dismiss the notion myself, since there is no other evidence or pattern to back it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However considering the Dark Elf Cleric from Dismal Rage is disguised as a High Elf and has a position as librarian, the possibility cannot be completely dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tonricade, I don't know what you beef is with me stating that she is not up to any good, or perhaps you will critisize me for suggesting Dismal Rage is a bunch of evil doers? Please don't drag other threads into this one, this is about Opal,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;I think she's a greedy self centered little imp, who has an inflated view of her own importance.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;She's clearly too ambitious for her own good, because she's been thrown out of Neriak - but this can also be indicative of her own failure.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh? She was thrown out of Neriak, I didn't know that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't knwo what power she has exactly, but being able to pull off a scam like pretending to be a High Elf and infiltrating Acrane Sciences takes more then just an illusion (lets not assume the wizards to be completely daft) and being the Cleric Guild Leader of Dismal Rage is not a lowly feat either. She may be ambitious and oflates her importance, but I wouldn't call her a nobody either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides an ambitious fool is often more danagerous then they should otherwise be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tornicade, Good and Evil exist in the extremes in this game, so classsifying things as Good, Evil and Neutral is a recurring theme, which was the orriginal intent of their Diety selection system at character creation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeport is Grey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most cities are one or the other. Felwith is all good, Neriak is all Evil. In Riverdale the halflings are living a serene life, with only an occasional dog bit or a jumjum thief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you come to Freeport and it's a nice place, a Guard at every corner, a real peacable place by all standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or at least it seems that way, Underneath you find out much is amiss and there is a real struggle of Good vs Evil. Hence the Grey, Freeport is not held entirely by the forces of good or evil, Knights of truth vs Freeport Militia (with Dismal rage and Coalation Underground and Steel Warriors being tossed intot he mix).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dismal Rage is an evil organization, and it's spreading it's roots through Freeport. Opal has infiltrated the Caster Guilds, Dismal Rage plots against the worshipers of Marr and Knights of Truth. Sabatoging their property (pirana in their waters) murdering their agents in the sewers, and harrassing and threatening their followers in general (see Jartin vs Narl in the Commons) Dismal Rage even works directly for the self proclaimed leader of Freeport and opperates with his direct permission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My point?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Opal may be a nobody, the organization that she is a part of, Dismal Rage, and their contacts, is not something to be taken so lightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by KAhm on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;05-19-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;10:34 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It's not an evil city if that's what you are suggesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-No SK, Rogue or Necro guild, no evil deity classes start there for example.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
