    <description>Just for comedy's sake, I was able to name a character "Namingfiltersux"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Yes, I realize it's against the rules.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, it kind of shows how the filter is broken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Will the filter be opened up on the naming convention at launch?  Currently any name you plug in gets kicked back from the filter.. I've had a name for 6.5 years which we'll call &amp;quot;Bob&amp;quot;.  Bob isn't inappropriate yet when I plug it into the character name field at creation or if it's in any place within the name like &amp;quot;fubob&amp;quot;  it fails.  I have this name on 3 servers and it's on 6 servers right now.  If someone beats me to it, nothing I can do but I would like to have the opportunity to get my name.  I have done character searches across the servers from EQ Live to check if a name was being used on the server and it came back with no records yet the name would not work in character creation. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks for your time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>There should be a way to communicate with someone to combat a rejected name. It is ridiculous that so many names are rejected for no real understandable reason. i personally, am i running out of names to use on other servers. Chanaluss is already rejected on all servers, presumably because &amp;quot;**SMURF**&amp;quot; is in the middle, but eh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the naming filter is B-R-O-K-E-N. The only thing i can see it do, is reject names that have no issues (like Dhyghog -- only 1 hit on google, and that was because i used the name on my guild forums) whereas allowing clear violations (like wannadome)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ah well. hopefully they will actually look into the naming system, and allow it to be amended for the combine. too many good, clean names arent acceptable&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I think a lot of the problem with this is not the name filter itself.  Its old characters on old servers.  Most people probably have their account slots full or close to it with character names, even those people whose account is no longer active.  I dont know when unactive accounts get their characters deleted, but until then they still have the name taken.  You have to remember how old most of these servers are and that a lot of people have come and gone and some might still have characters that are in the system.  I know when I left WoW I didn't delete any of my chars, I just let my account go inactive in case I feel compelled to return for some reason. &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There should have been some form of cleanup when they did the server merges.  Any toon under 10th lvl that hadn't been played in a while should have been deleted.  I know I lost a few toons when they did the merges..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Producer’s Letter – May 19, 2006&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Everybody,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The big news these days seems to be the progression server officially named The Combine. First off, I am overwhelmed by the interest and although I know it won't satisfy everyone's desires it does look like the idea is appealing to a large number of people. It is great to see the excitement out there and not just with our active players but hearing a lot of people talking about reforming old guilds and coming back to the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The response has also, quite honestly, got us a bit worried. We are working on taking a few steps to make sure we can handle the possible load. Primarily we are going to cap the maximum online population. We consider this a much better solution than the inevitable zone crashes that would begin when we start to hit higher loads. The last thing we want to do is limit the amount of players that can participate but we have to make sure we maintain a good play experience as well. Over the past few years the servers have stayed very stable so they can handle some pretty big populations so the server will still be plenty full.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#ffff33"&gt;We understand that there are many players that have become attached to their character name. In an effort to allow people to reserve their name before the launch of the server we are going to set up a limited version that will allow you to log on and create a character. You will not be able to enter the game world itself but you will be able to pre-create your character and reserve your name. Having the name you want is even more important when you consider that this server will be freshly tracking all item discoveries and leaderboards on our EQPlayers service. Who will be first to discover the highly sought after Fire Beetle Eye!?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;There will be a lot more to talk about as we get into our beta and closer to the launch of The Combine server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chris &amp;quot;Raghnell&amp;quot; Lena&lt;br&gt;EQ Producer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to my cut and paste, they will give us the ability to lock in our names before server launch.. At least lock them in if they get through the filter..&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I agree. I made a new character last night to run through the tutorial last night - I haven't played in over a year and Iwanted to remember how to do things, and I ran into the same problem. Any name with cal in it was rejected. I don't want to have to pay $50 to get my proper name.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;A lot of the rejections you get are due to names being taken already.&amp;nbsp; That's particularly true with older servers or servers where players come to check things out from time to time (zek and test, for instance).&amp;nbsp; That won't be an issue, at least initially,&amp;nbsp;on the new server since names are server specific.&amp;nbsp; The actual filters themselves, though, are global and will be the same as all the other servers.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>I had a wizard on Xegony named Keldfyre, but I was unable to reclaim that name, and I haven't been able to use it on other servers either. Eqplayers doesn't bring up anyone with that name... So... is there something about it that I am not seeing that would be in the filter?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks Rash.. I'm glad this won't be a concern.. it just had me worried because when I was testing the name creation is was plugging in &amp;quot;dffgrimoiu&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;wergrim&amp;quot; &amp;quot;grimljh&amp;quot;  and they would fail. So i was thinking that the filter had issue with anything &amp;quot;Grim&amp;quot;.  I was literally using random letters with grim to no avail..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the clarification.. Now I just have to hope no one jacks my name..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I've been messing on birstlebane with newbs and had the name rejection issues.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;7/8 of my regular names from vazaelle  were rejected, and I've tried nightly for about 10 days to do a /who all and NONE of the character names were logged in. I know that it's possible that these are simply names that have been taken and possibly the characters are inlimbo but it seemed odd that 7/8 were taken (some of the names are kidna unique).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I also changed my surname on vazaelle then tried changing it back a week later only to have the filter tell me it was rejected (after having had the surname for 4+ years.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;devs may say it's working as intented but it does seem a bit quirly lately.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I believe that trying to send an in-game email to a name is a good test of whether it's in use; if it gets instantly bounced back, it's not in use.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That said, I was trying to make a new toon named &amp;quot;Salmon&amp;quot; the other day. No variation of Salmon(+misc endings) would work. So now, my new toon is named &amp;quot;Mypenix.&amp;quot;  I figure I'll petition a GM to have my name changed, since it offends me... :P&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;sorry (no edit) would like to add,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the names that are being rejected have been used on OTHER servers,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;it's like if it's been used on ANY server it will now be rejected (filter sorting annomoly left over from the server mergers maybe?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;possible? rashere?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;ok a little more messing around produced the result:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i can delete a character and make a new one with the same name,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;if i delete a char my second account can NOT re-use that same name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;so it appears that names are &amp;quot;account bound&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;if that is the case then once that name is used, even if deleted, then it is unavailable to anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;now I'de hate to re-activate an account and find all my names were changed/given away, BUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;if the character has been deleted from an active account (but especially from an inactive account) then it should be available to the next person who plugs it in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>
