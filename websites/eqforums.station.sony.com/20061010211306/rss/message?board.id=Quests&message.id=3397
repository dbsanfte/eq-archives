      <description>This is definitely an interesting mission. You need to "train" 40 adventurers out of Lguk. Now, you can't kill them, they are too powerful. The frogloks don't assist you...so I take this is a literal meaning. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, to train the adventurers, you aggro them....but then what? If you run to the Upper Guk zone line, you bounce back to Executioner Room...and the aggro remains, so the adventureres promptly turn around and run after you...never zoning. But if you die near zone in, the adventurers just stay there. How do you "train" an adventurer? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, the timer is wrong on the mission. In the mission window, it says 6 hours. But the mission actually ends in 1 hour. Is this intentional or a bug? I don't know, I can't even get 1 adventurer to be trained. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyone done this mission lately have any info on how to "train" the adventurers?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Missed the question above...&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
yes, they DO run once you beat them down.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
We had 1 mob run (and zone, got credit for it) @ 20%, another didn't run until 5%&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Problem is, the mob killed 3-4 of our group on each fight. As the&#xD;
shaman (only healer) I was only able to keep the MT healed until the&#xD;
mob was around 50%.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
This thing has to be broken, it is impossible to clear 40 of these in 1 hour.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
The only strategy I've come up with is to choose all warrors, pull the exe room and just fight til you respawn, rinse, repeat...&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I'll post how it goes..&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

That mission irks me for a while now. Yes, it was too easy but they changed it to its current form. But I seriously doubt that the mission has been completed once in its current state. I presume that if you get the adventurer low enough they will eventually run on their own. But it's really hard to just put a dent in their hp bar ... let alone get 40 in 1h. I have mentioned that mission several times to no avail.</description>
