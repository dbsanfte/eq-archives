				<DIV>Something I'd like to have featured in the upcoming expansions is factions that matter once again.&nbsp; The faction system from Planes of Power on forward has been woefully lacking.&nbsp; Typically there are a large number of factions that do not matter, and then one or two factions which players need to raise in order to do the quests of that expansion.&nbsp; After many complaints about factions not mattering, DoN was released in which we had 2 factions we could raise (mutually exclusive) but whose faction path mirrored each other.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was essentially no difference between the factions.&nbsp; In fact, you might as well had only 3 factions in the DoN expansion:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>1. Good guys</DIV>
<DIV>2. Bad guys</DIV>
<DIV>3. Victims of the Good and Bad Guys (use this for the natives of the DoN zones).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>For some strange reason, I don't think this is what people meant when they said they wanted factions to matter again.&nbsp; Compare this to the much more complex and realistic faction system of the original game, Kunark, Velious, and Luclin and you can see how lacking it is.&nbsp; There could be much more to the faction system in DoN.&nbsp; Some of the mission hints at attempts to open up dialogues and relations with the goblins of Stillmoon temple, or other attempts to seek allies in the DoN zones.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the NPC's of these zones are almost all on unraisable factions.&nbsp; I can raise similar issues and examples for the faction system in GoD, OoW, LoY (what faction?), LDoN, and PoP.</DIV>
