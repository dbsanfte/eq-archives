      <description>Breaking down level wise..is it worthwhile to give your pets weapons ? and what weapons should you scrap ? rusty ? bronze ? FS ? etc ? should you only bother with mage summoned weaps ? are Weapons really all that effective for adding to the dps of a pet ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1-10 ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;11-20 ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;21-30 ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;31-40 ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;41-50 ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;51-58 ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;59 ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;60-70 ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What question would you like to ask a developer about the necromancer class?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Every week (in the current form, but subject to change) each correspondent will be asking one question of the developers. The main questions I've been asking are basically about top ten issues and hotbutton issues. I will leave this thread stickied for a while, and I'll heavilly moderate it for anything that isn't a question or helpful. We can make discussion threads on individual issues, however this thread will merely serve as a reference for the correspondent in constructing the weekly question.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Remember there won't be polling or anything, but if I like your question, and especially if it isn't a "gimmee", SOE envy, or class envy orientated, it stands a decent chance of getting asked by me. Responses by the devs aren't guarenteed either, but I will continue to do my best in getting those answers.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;This thread will be for tracking items that have received RESPONSES from the developers, and questions that remain UNANSWERED.&amp;nbsp; Red will indicate answered questions, while white remains unanswered questions&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This listing will be updated from the top weekly, and the older items will be at the end of the thread.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Week of June 19, 2006&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Necro question (Zajeer)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;From the March 22nd HoC chat of this year this question was asked:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"Brannoc - *Arial* Hi! This question is for Zajeer. Being that most of the items in the game have been itemized through demi plane is there any plans to rethink some of the more less desirable drops and possibly bring them in line with there counterparts? "&lt;BR&gt;With this answer:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"Zajeer-Dev - I’m definitely open to feedback on specific items from specific zones that seem a little less than desirable for certain players. I’ve been receiving a ton of feedback through email, the boards, and in game about specific items and how to make them better. I’ll be keeping an eye on specific items and making adjustments in the coming patches. "&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Some input from the necromancer community includes adding additional modifiers to our demiplane class item. &lt;BR&gt;-Spellshielding&lt;BR&gt;-Shielding&lt;BR&gt;-Dot Shielding&lt;BR&gt;-Stun Resist&lt;BR&gt;-Regen/FT&lt;BR&gt;All the above modifiers are getting rarer and rarer, and unless they are added to more armor, it will be incredibly hard for necromancers to keep maxed at one or multiple mods.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Additionally, changing the mod from evocation (which caps at 100 for 99.9% necros) to either alteration or conjuration would be helpful, as this is where almost all our spells come from.&amp;nbsp; Adding a modifer such as ID IV would also help bring the item more on par with other items in the zone.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thx!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Week of June 12, 2006&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Apokalyps wrote:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Why was the necromancer oow tier 1 and teir 2 clickies changed in the June 13 patch?&amp;nbsp; The clicky used to last 60 secs, now it lasts 18 and 36 secs respectively.&amp;nbsp; To say the community is up in arms over this 2 year old content nerf would be a severe understatement at best.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;In this form the clicky is mitigated severely and many folks who over the course of years have paid top notch amount of DKP for a misrepresented item.&amp;nbsp; EQ players are entitled to continuity of content and knowing the items they loot aren't subject to revision two years and many expansions after the fact.&lt;BR&gt;Message Edited by Apokalyps on 06-14-2006 03:23 PM&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Rashere) The change was intentional to bring the necro clickes to some semblance of balance with the other OOW clickies.&amp;nbsp; It's still far more powerful than the other ones, but not quite to the degree it was before.&amp;nbsp; It's not changing back.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Week of May 29, 2006&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;QUESTION:&lt;BR&gt;Apokalyps wrote:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Is it possible for necromancers to get channeling mastery as we damage nearly as much as enchanters do?&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;ANSWER:&lt;BR&gt;Channeling Mastery is mainly a tank ability to help them cast their spells while in combat.&amp;nbsp; It was offered to Enchanters as well because they often find themselves under attack, moreso than other intelligence casters.&amp;nbsp; It's not something we are planning to offer Necromancers, Magicians, or Wizards.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Question week May 15, 2006&lt;BR&gt;-PoR spell inquiry re-submitted&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Question week May 8, 2006&lt;BR&gt;-Willful Death AA inquiry re-submitted&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Question week May 1, 2006&lt;BR&gt;Necromancer question:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Can Willful Death receive adjustment to become a viable pulling and survival ability?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Willful Death only works at a maximum of 25% of the time, and when it fails, it is difficult to ascertain and usually the result is death.&amp;nbsp; Increasing the ability so that on a resisted spell it works 100% of the time would make it reliable and effective, and help Necromancers pick up the pulling slack when other classes are not available.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Increasing this ability some degree of reliability would not be unbalancing, yet would promote fairness.&amp;nbsp; Monks have a 100% chance to FD though a spell, if resisted, and a 50% chance if not. Bards have fade. Shadowknight’s- the Necromancers hybrid- have a heightened ability to survive due to their higher mitigation, AC, and HP.&amp;nbsp; Over time Necromancers have received little to no help in modifying their pulling ability, but modification of this ability could help in that regard.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thx!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Since I received a message after posting from Kytherea in the question thread saying that aa's won't be seeing an answer for a while, I submitted an alternate question:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Q (Prathun): Spell damage upgrades are essential in each expansion in order to keep Necromancers in line damage wise.&amp;nbsp; Considering the only dps upgrade of the expansion was a trap spell which is at best one of the lowest damaging dots we've got in years, while having a plethora of CC and no ability to see the functioning of it from the players perspective;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Is it possible for either:&lt;BR&gt;1) Changing our trap spell to an aura that increases % damage for the group of all dots run (set 20% or so), as per discussion with Rytan during beta?&amp;nbsp; Or perhaps removing our aura spell all together for a pure damaging spell, like a low resist prismatic or chromatic dot with decent efficiency.&lt;BR&gt;2) Increasing the Mind Flay upgrade from 15mana/tick to something higher/tick or with a lower resist (either magic or poison instead of disease like MW was)&lt;BR&gt;3) Increasing the new lich from 7mana/tick to 15mana/tick being that its function and the duration between expansions merits a full upgrade and not an ancient?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In any case, there is ample discussion on beta spell boards, eqnecro.net, eqlive (necrotomb), and necrotalk.com regarding the type of spells necromancers would like to see replace the current form.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you very much!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=necromancerbalance&amp;message.id=3274#M3274</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Since they gave us the ability to see our pet spell damages, I noticed something disturbing on the Lost Soul pet.&amp;nbsp; I can see every non-melee dmg that my pet does to the mob including weapon procs (13-ish dps with 2 Burning Shanks) and the DS he has on if someone casts it on him.&amp;nbsp; However, I do not see any damage from the lifetap procs.&amp;nbsp; In the same time frame that he proc'd 2 Burning Shanks 80 times, he proc'd a spell that gives the message "Jenaner staggers" 157 times.&amp;nbsp; I am under the impression that "soandso staggers" is for taps and nothing else.&amp;nbsp; If I'm not seeing any lifetap damage messages, just what proc is he proc'ing that causes them to stagger and even if it's not a tap, what is the proc?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=necromancerbalance&amp;message.id=3267#M3267</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I dont know what happened but snare agro kiteing in nest like I always do, there is nothing new.&amp;nbsp; So I pull the mob, snare it, and cast my usual line up to get firm agro Dread Prye, and 2 other DoTs which keeps HoTT.&amp;nbsp; Now my friend bard which is usually around runs in as usual and do some dmg and bam he gets instant agro.&amp;nbsp; He fades x2 maybe it was a bug and he still has HoTT.&amp;nbsp; Then I send in my pet bam it gets HoTT, even FD and the drake is still trying to find him.&amp;nbsp; Then Cleric does her shield epic bam she gets agro. then shammy which is a lower level 65 lost some hps from the shield and drake kills him.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So confused, try it again, so far each mob I have like 1/2 agro.&amp;nbsp; I need to cast x2 more dots now then I used to just to keep HoTT and not get my pet muched.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So once again thanks for the patch, I'm so sick and tired of no play testing and nerfing.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Class Issue List dead?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=necromancerbalance&amp;message.id=3167#M3167</link>
      <description>So, is this about how it works now?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
1) The class top 10 issue list is dead (not like it's seen all that much action in months anywyas).&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
2) The class rep (correspondent if you will) gets questions from the class.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
3) The class rep gives 2 questions weekly to Kyth.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
4) Kyth forwards the questions to devs.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
5) Devs may or may not reply to Kyth.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
6) Kyth forwards replies, when they exist, to class reps.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
7) Class reps inform the masses that:&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp; a) Things are working as intended.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp; b) Not at this time.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp; c) Do not have a timeframe.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp; d) [insert sarcastic response here :)]&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
That seems to be something of a convoluted game of telephone, but hey&#xD;
if it works that's all I really care about.&amp;nbsp; Speaking of working,&#xD;
I have yet to see any questions answered for our class.&amp;nbsp; That&#xD;
means our rep isn't asking, Kyth isn't forwarding, dev's aren't&#xD;
replying, Kyth isn't forwarding replies, our class rep isn't replying&#xD;
to us, of I have just missed them and if so mea culpa.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I've heard that many class' top 10 list were peppered with 'gimmee' items that were not going to be considered.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
It makes one wonder which of our items were not up for consideration, and even better why not.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Having that answered may have gone a long way to getting a more&#xD;
reasonable (from the dev's perspective) top 10 list, and may have&#xD;
allowed the list to remain more of a functional working animal for&#xD;
positive in game change.&amp;nbsp; What's done is done though, so now&#xD;
knowing will only help us articulate weekly questions that have a&#xD;
chance of being replied to.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
By the way, what questions have been submitted each week for our class?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
The mage class board indicated that not all reps have submitted questions (May 12th), hope that wasn't us:&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Question about Necros</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=necromancerbalance&amp;message.id=3143#M3143</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am goign to be running 2 accounts on one puter and want to make one a Necro (or Magician).  What would be the best Class to group with a Necro?  I am assuming a healer class. &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt; I do NOT want to Kite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;.  I will hardly ever be grouping outside of me and myself.  So what other class with a Necro will give me the most utility to level to 70 with relative ease?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also, are Necro pets tough enough to tank most of the MOBs with a healer as a duo?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>2 ideas from a mana feeding fiend</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=necromancerbalance&amp;message.id=3134#M3134</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;since necros often take up the role of mana battery in most groups and raids, have a way where we can visually see how much mana our target has with out haveing to go &amp;quot;how is your mana&amp;quot; every 2 mins.......my second idea is change up how sacrifice works, currently the mein use for it is the ee's for rezing people.....i have found very few necros that use any of the other spells that require EE's.  For us EE's are rather expensive to make.... the only way we get some if a) we have a bot that is high enough in lvl to sac, b) get lucky and some guy just wants to lvl down fast....or c) pay an arm and leg to let someone sec them a few times.........in most cases its c.  some of use are rather to broke to do that so we a are stuck with no EE's.  i suggest a way to use sacrifice on npc mobs, if it is successfuly we get the ee but no xp, if you make it this easy for us to make ee's i wont care if they become no trade or not......well thats my ideas to help us out a little and even make us of some of those ee spells you gave us&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Necromancers Trap (level 55 and 70 is a waste of time)</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=necromancerbalance&amp;message.id=3115#M3115</link>
      <description>The spell &amp;quot;Death Rune&amp;quot; ended going live as something far less than we would have prefered, being a last minute replacement for a spell we all liked very much (soul rune). As such it received very little testing or feedback. A quick browse of the necromancer forums will show comments such as &amp;quot;deleted from my spell book&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;totally worthless&amp;quot;. We were promised a review of the spells after they had gone live becasue they were placed in at the last minute and Id like to give some feedback now so that that can be done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Firstly some facts about the trap, I will look at the level 70 version since I dont have the 55 :-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;440 Damage per tick for 4 ticks (total 1760 damage) for 100 mana.&lt;br&gt;30 second recast timer.&lt;br&gt;6 seconds cast time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This makes it :-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- 1st in terms of DPM!&lt;br&gt;- 7th most powerful dot in terms of DPS (73.3 DPS)&lt;br&gt;- 17th in terms of total damage!!!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Usability :&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Because it is non-targetable it is unusable in situations where crowd control is required.&lt;br&gt;- Because it despawns after 60 seconds it is often unusable in soloing situations (it can take several minutes to split mobs)&lt;br&gt;- Only one can be placed at a time (and even if we cold place more it wouldnt be possible with the 60 second timer and 30 seconds recast timer)&lt;br&gt;- Because of the 6 seconds cast time we cannot realistically drop or refresh the trap in the middle of a kite or fight while soloing.&lt;br&gt;- Im told we still get aggro from it - however the DPS is so low its a bit of a non issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bugs :&lt;br&gt;- Sometime kills itself.&lt;br&gt;- Sometimes causes the corpse to disappear on death.&lt;br&gt;- Sometimes disables all spell gems when cast.&lt;br&gt;- Sometimes will not trigger even if mob is dragged right over it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So we have a dot which is unusable in most groups (due to CC, pulling ad placement issues) and because of the low total damage and long cast time we would be unlikely to mem for soloing.  Even though this has the highest DPM the damage is far more in line with a sub level 60 spell! In other words very few people are going to use it as part of their normal spell set up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now what I would do to adjust the problem I perceive with this spell (low DPS and total damage despite being highly situational) depends on how its supposed to be used.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If its supposed to be used only on pull AND be situational :-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Triple the damage and quadrupple the mana cost.&lt;br&gt;While that would make it our number 1 dot in terms of DPS (220 DPS) and DPM, because it involves a mob being pulled right over it and thus a co-operative puller making only single pulls, it would still be situational. Id STILL expect not to be using this in most groups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If its supposed to be used as part of our regular spell book :-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Lower the cast time to 3.5 seconds.&lt;br&gt;- Double the damage and mana cost.&lt;br&gt;- Increase the despawn time to 5 minutes.&lt;br&gt;- Allow more than 1 to be in play at once.&lt;br&gt;- Ensure that they stack only if cast by different players.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thats what *I* would do, I know other will have different ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In its current state though, &amp;quot;death rune&amp;quot; is a useless spell, and considering the time and effort put into programming for it, and the fact that we players expect to get spells from expansions that we will actually use; something SHOULD be done about it. Some feedback would be nice regarding what is being done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alternatively, get rid of the trap altogether and give us back the soul rune aura *grin*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next Post : Mind Flay - the spell that is such a marginal upgrade that nobody even cares that they cant find it.&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;i've been gone a LONG time. i had a 55 druid and a 35 necro before i left. unfortunately i cant for the life of me remember the name/pass for the account and the emails i used back then are now defunct. ah well. starting over with titanium.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;made a gnome necro on xegony. impressed with the tutorial. however it has become clear that even the old spell list in my ruins of kunark prima guide are woefully out of date - the levels are way off.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;anywhere i can find a complete list of spells for the necromancer as well as a levelling guide? everywhere i go now it's all about aa's and shrouds and end game - all of which i have no clue what it means atm&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;thanks in advance&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>How will you deal with this new TOP TEN list now, Sauruman?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=necromancerbalance&amp;message.id=3083#M3083</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="postbody"&gt;the list is out and i guess its ok. its the best we could reach, imho. and you did a good job sauruman, even if some guys are still argueing on both boards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;but, how will you deal with this list now differently?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;what will be different to Sissls approach, who had unfortunately just limited succes to make something happen. no doubt, sissl made something happen, but the devs ignored alot of the other stuff, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;what is your approach sauruman, to make it happen. and even if you cant make it happen, to at least get a statement from the devs, why it shouldnt be. for every **SMURF** point on our list. this is at least my expectation. and not just &amp;quot; we are looking at it for next expansion, perhaps, ......&amp;quot;. something substantial, please! even a clear NO, which means, to explain, why they say NO.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;is your goal to really implement a bilateral discussion amongst necs and devs via their correspondent starting with this new list? you know? bilateral means to openly discuss with each other and this didnt happen in the last 6 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and do you think, that the devs are allowed, or willing, or even just able to do something like a discussion and not just throwing a bone from time to time?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and if you are convinced, why?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;all my support, no doubt. but whats your next steps bro?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by FrankTheTank on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;01-14-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;08:22 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Do Mobs regen at incredible rates when Im FD</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=necromancerbalance&amp;message.id=3081#M3081</link>
      <description>Can someone explain to me why..oh why....does a mob regen hit points at an incrdible rate when you FD and your pet it getting whacked because you were stupid and didint split the mobs. I have noticed an incredible regen abilty of all mobs that I took down to 10% health, I FD due to adds or mob is pounding me too hard, whatever the reason. My pet is still dealing damage but has not taken full agro off of me. Then 1 minute later I take off FD and the mob is at 90% health, even tho my DOTS were still active and pet (Some how) was still alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I believe this was a KS preventive measure I think. Not sure but it is infuriating tho.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stregg 66 necro Maelin Starpyre.&lt;br&gt;Grothicus 67 cleric Maelin Starpyre&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>
