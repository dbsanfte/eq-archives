				<div></div>&nbsp;The reason this server is even going to come into being is because of the high demand of a server with no expansions to bring back the old crowd. No one said you have to play like casual players, but the casual players sure don't have to play your way either.<br><br>&nbsp;It seems you want it *your* way as well and you don't give a flip about anyone elses thoughts or opinions. You even try to get mad at Kytherea because you think their comment isn't "on your side of the fence."&nbsp; Thats the only reason why i could see you taking that comment the wrong way.<br><br>&nbsp;Oh and btw, sorry in advance if you take my opinion in a negative way. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-tongue.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br><div></div>

<P>Of course I don't think everyone wants to go through the content as fast as they can, nor do I "want" them to. I'm pretty sure my point was to play how how you want to, and not get an ulcer over what&nbsp; few other guilds are doing. </P>
