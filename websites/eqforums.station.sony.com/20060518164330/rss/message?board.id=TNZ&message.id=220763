    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Sorry about the stretch when I put in that long URL for the patcher, I didn't realize it would be that bad.&amp;nbsp; It was that or go on &lt;BR&gt;for a bit about the knowledge base and the new petition system and such, which will be a different post.&amp;nbsp; For this post I will &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;put in hard returns which might make it a bit easier for some people to read.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Q:&amp;nbsp; What happened to my hotkeys, UI, and other stuff like that?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A:&amp;nbsp; Depending on how long you've been gone, we've had two major UI changes.&amp;nbsp; The original UI is no longer usable for those &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;that liked peering into it (I used it until the very last minute when they disabled it entirely).&amp;nbsp; There are a couple of sites that can &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;help you with customized UIs, EQInterface is one of them.&amp;nbsp; &lt;A href="http://www.eqinterface.com/" target=_blank&gt;http://www.eqinterface.com/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My interface is considered default, although I have moved the various windows around so that they are essentially in the order&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;of the old UI which is quite a bit different than what you get with a new character.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Recently the hotkeys were changed to a single vertical bar, instead of the two across rectangle it was before.&amp;nbsp; They work just &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;the same, they just look different.&amp;nbsp; I think, but am not sure since I didn't want to create a third EQ directory on my system, that &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;the Action bar is now defaulted as off.&amp;nbsp; To get it back, the command is Alt M (for menu).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The Window Selector bar is also defaulted as off now, with a little square EQ box replacing it.&amp;nbsp; The EQ Box has some very &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;nice options that the window selector bar doesn't have, like (going back to those hotkeys) you can have up to 4 banks of &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;hotkeys up.&amp;nbsp; However, if like me you do resist change and want the window selector box, then the command is Alt W (for &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;window).&amp;nbsp; I am trying to convert over to the little box, but I'm not quite there yet, I have both up.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you deleted your EQ directory, all of the things you put on your old hotkeys are gone and will need to be redone.&amp;nbsp; While you &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;are setting up new assist keys and such, check out the options to change various message colors, I for one HATE the &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"invisi-blue" and have no messages that come to me in that color.&amp;nbsp; I do have different colors than default set for various types &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;of messages, like guild chat and say and tells are all different colors.&amp;nbsp; That works for me.&amp;nbsp; What works for other people is to &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;set up a series of different chat windows, all with different defaults.&amp;nbsp; Although most of my characters only have 1 or 2 chat &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;boxes (other people have a multiple number), I admit for Ice that I have set up three:&amp;nbsp; a channel chat box, my general chat &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;box, and a direct tell box.&amp;nbsp; The direct tell and channel boxes grey almost all the way out, the main box stays fairly dark.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Some people put combat spam in a different window, I just turned most of that off, so no, I don't know when someone makes &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;a critical hit or whatever.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you didn't delete your EQ directory but your hotkeys or UI seem to be missing, it may be because of the server merge.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Check for files like UI_CharacterName_ServerName&amp;nbsp;or CharacterName_ServerName and change the file names to reflect &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;your new server name.&amp;nbsp; You can also copy settings from one character to another by making a copy of the file and &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;renaming it from CharacterA name to CharacterB name.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You'll also notice that your inventory window has changed.&amp;nbsp; From little things like seeing the actual number of your mana &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;pool and available mana (which, with a custom UI you can put outside in your character information box) to more major &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;stuff.&amp;nbsp; The old picture of yourself that used to be in the center has gone, now&amp;nbsp;there is your class symbol (that change was &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;made a couple of&amp;nbsp;years ago).&amp;nbsp; More recently, the entire window was redesigned to make room for more tabs and such which &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;caused some shifting around of where your worn and equipped items used to be.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;While on the subject of UI changes, two major&amp;nbsp;non-character changes have been made (plus the bank window is a bit &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;different now with the transfer slots).&amp;nbsp; The merchant UI is different and you can now sort items in a variety of ways, up or &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;down by Quantity, Cost, or Alpha.&amp;nbsp; BTW, merchants no longer have hidden stock, what you see is what you get.&amp;nbsp; The &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Tradeskill interface was quite remarkably changed.&amp;nbsp; Tradeskill containers now have two available views, one (the old view) &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;is now called the "experiment" view.&amp;nbsp; The new Tradeskill View shows you learned or selected recipes (plus their trivial which &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;is color coded like mob cons), and will show you if you have the ingredients for that combine, has a button to do the combine, &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;and an autoinventory button even.&amp;nbsp; No more clicking and dragging unless you want to, or if you need to learn a new recipe.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You can open up the containers either with a Right Click, or with a CTRL Right Click to toggle back and forth between the &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;two views.&amp;nbsp; Using the tradeskill view you can even make combines without emptying the container.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Ok, with the free come back offer and just because, we are getting a lot of people on the boards looking for rundowns on what has happened since X expansion.&amp;nbsp; Let's get together and put together everything we can think of on this thread for expansions after the initial trilogy (If you only played the trilogy, just figure this is some different game).&amp;nbsp; Feel free to either write your own opinions or link to threads that are your favorites.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Before we get into the other tips, here's a big one for people coming back.&amp;nbsp; In January a new bundled pack will be released for $20 that will have ALL expansions through Depths of Darkhollow (DoD or DoDh).&amp;nbsp; It can be used to start a new account or to upgrade an existing account.&amp;nbsp; In addition to being really awesomely cheap, you also get the special boxed gifts that as we understand can be claimed by only one character (all gifts to the one, but I'm not certain on that).&amp;nbsp; That would get you some largely uninspiring extras, but will give you a nice little pack and the free robo-boar mount.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;First off, here are some previous threads I have found helpful:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;OK, now what we need are non-expansion related changes.&amp;nbsp; I know that my interests and priorities will be different than other peoples.&amp;nbsp; So Let's get started! &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Ok.... maybe Im just older then the rest of you but... I played about 1 month after the release right up to the LdoN release and a little after. think thats a few veterns points... but man I was almost lost comming back yesterday. it was all just so new again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) people with equipment I have never seen before....... things iwth AUG's and progressive items.... think that came with LdoN but i didnt get too far into the dungeons ... now I read almost no one uses them... are there other items i should look for...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) epics being upgraded 2x great idea..... is it worth doing the mage epic and who would go to the plain of air... no one would before with me ... one reason i quit&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) lost my guild.... I have no home! who should i be looking at with a char list of 50 - 65  chars as long as the server allows all char slots used on zeb server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) is the LDoN equipment worth doing missions for ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5) other then Soloing is loot still grab what you can / split at the end / split during / whatever the groups decide....... the internal area question on ethic's of the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6) where should I start.... Griding out exp to 70 and gain equipment as I go slowly or ... work on getting the Equipment at the loss of Exp gain ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;wow ,..... and to think at one time I had such a clear goal on EQ!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;For people who have been gone a couple of years, it is quite a culture shock.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Have you been to the bazaar yet?&amp;nbsp; When you do, expand your window until you can see the price range at the bottom left corner and hide all traders at the bottom right.&amp;nbsp; You can do searches and look at the options.&amp;nbsp; Sellers who are advertising their wares are often willing to talk about what they offer.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;DoN cultural is often a very good buyable set of gear.&amp;nbsp; The pieces alone aren't that good but combined with Augs they are pretty darn sweet, especially for someone who has been gone.&amp;nbsp; They are attuneable which means once you put them on they become no drop.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Most people don't do LDoNs any more, there are better loots in DoN (Dragons of Norrath) and even with MM (monster missions from DoD, Depths of Darkhollow).&amp;nbsp; But there are groups out there, especially for clerics who want the group temp spell (north ro missions).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Loot rules still vary by group or guild.&amp;nbsp; If you do an LDoN you might find people pass on the Augs because they already have better.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And as to where you should start, I think you should start having fun.&amp;nbsp; Get to know the game again (really, do run through the tutorial), get to know some people, don't concentrate so much on your personal character development but get caught up on the game development.&amp;nbsp; You might some good people, you get in a guild, and it all becomes much easier.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>One minor correction about the zone updates. The old Oasis zone was split between the two new Ro desert zones. North Ro got most of what was the Desert part of Oasis (everything before the final set of dunes before the gypsies, and where Cazel mainly roamed before), while South Ro got the lake and everything else (including Spectre Tower).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even though the Desert part of Oasis went to North Ro, Cazel moved to South Ro to hang with his giant buddies at the new giant camps.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Time for some updates --&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Zone Revamps:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Lavastorm has been redone.&amp;nbsp; Personally I like it, some people don't.&amp;nbsp; It is a larger zone now and there are higher level mobs in parts of the zone.&amp;nbsp; The old mobs (many with redone graphics, I love the new basilisk model) are still from the nek zone line to Najeena.&amp;nbsp; You get to the DoN zones from Lavastorm.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Nektulos has been redone.&amp;nbsp; The first redo was icky.&amp;nbsp; We're about to get redo redux, I've visited on test and the zone is much more appealing and is once again larger than a postage stamp.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;North Ro has been redone.&amp;nbsp; Hills are a bit, umm, wavier? and there are still some line of sight issues.&amp;nbsp; But is a nice looking zone.&amp;nbsp; Some things are moved around a bit and some things are added.&amp;nbsp; You can no longer zone in the water from North Ro to Oasis, mostly because Oasis isn't there any more.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;South Ro has been redone, combining it with Oasis.&amp;nbsp; Visually and stylistically connected to North Ro.&amp;nbsp; A whole new batch of Sand Giants has appeared.&amp;nbsp; Orc highway, however, is gone.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Freeport has been redone significantly.&amp;nbsp; People are mixed on the redo.&amp;nbsp; Some like, some not.&amp;nbsp; I give it a C grade.&amp;nbsp; Some of the visuals are great, especially from a far view.&amp;nbsp; I feel the textures and the close up view, especially for the little people don't have enough variety and there is very little character.&amp;nbsp; My opinion anyway.&amp;nbsp; Access to the PoR (Prophecy of Ro) zones are in Freeport and the Ros.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Hidden potions&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In DoHD, there are red mushrooms. When you target these, they don't have a name in your target window. These mushrooms can be &amp;quot;opened&amp;quot;, and if you're lucky, they can be looted. I've found a couple different varieties of haste potions in them so far. The potions are lore, but not no trade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And apparently if you're unlucky, they might spawn something that will attack you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>One other important thing that i don't think i saw mentioned.   Cleric HP buffs(Temp, Virtue, Conviction) don't cost Peridots to cast any more.   So bumming temp for a new toon is a viable option if you need it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Hmmm. Lots of good info but a lot of missing info too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tribute masters in PoK. By donating equipment and plat to tribute masters, you get access to a variety of buffs. This is a boon to people who solo and duo. There are personal tribute masters and ones that apply to the entire guild.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Newbie zones are full of tumbleweeds. All the players are in the tutorial until L10. Don't expect too many people to be LFG pre-20. Also, don't expect to find many people in the cities. Everyone congregates in PoK.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many zones were vamped and revamped. Beyond those previously mentioned are Splitpaw and Mistmoor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For tradeskillers, GoD and the Abysmal sea added a lot of recipes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OoW introduced a whole new line of powerful augments (e.g. +11 to individual stats).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With DoN, very nice cultural armors were added. They supercede the newbie quest gear at L15 in their quality. Some are not too hard to obtain whereas others require encounters that severely outweigh the gear. With these cultural armors come cultural augments, which make the armor much better than the old newbie quest gear. These armors and augments are crafted through tradeskills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DoN also introduced corpse summoning altars just off PoK and guild halls that contain guild banks, altars with porting capability, and mana/hp regen pools.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will add more as I discover them... returning after a year abroad myself.&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by ether_sphynx on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;03-19-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;09:39 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Tribute masters in PoK?&amp;nbsp; Have I missed these?&amp;nbsp; I thought they were still only in home towns.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Once you have tributed, you can turn on/off the tribute by Alt U, but you can only change what you want at the tribute masters themselves.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A friend of mine is thinking of returning to EQ after being gone since before Velious.  Does anyone know if he can move his toons to a server of his choice for free or would it still cost money? Read the whole post and didn't see anything mentioned in here about that.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;The only free /movelogs were available to people actively playing their accounts during the merger period.&amp;nbsp; The period only lasted 30 days after&amp;nbsp;your server&amp;nbsp;merged.&amp;nbsp; If you waited until day 35 to decide you were out of luck.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As your friend is out of luck for a free move.&amp;nbsp; The characters will be on the merged server and your friend can pay to move them.&amp;nbsp; However, depending on what level they were it might be just as easy with your help to start over.&amp;nbsp;Let him know that it is not as slow as in the old days and remember that you can shroud down to join him.&amp;nbsp; Before I would fork over money, I'd go through the tutorial and the related PoK armor quests.&amp;nbsp; I know that the gear is better than anything I had at 20 during the velious era.&amp;nbsp; Go go bronze age!&amp;nbsp; Even with top levels and top of the line Velious gear, your friend is going to have to do some serious upgrade anyway.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Although selling plat is against the EULA, you can see if there is someone interested in trading plat.&amp;nbsp; I'd go to the server I want to play on offering to trade XX plat from the other server for XX plat on the current server.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes there are other people in similar circumstances who either have alts or friends or on other servers.&amp;nbsp; Of course, these sorts of transactions are honor system and once you click trade it is final, even if you get scammed in the process so be careful.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

You can set what you want the tribute to do at the same personal tribute master, and you can turn it on/off in the field.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quick question. I have been gone since right after GoD release. I also bought a new computer (man is it a hotty LOL). I dont have my discs anymore so today I downloaded and started the patcher. After it did the initial download (thank goodness for cable) I had time to do the advanced and start all the expansions to downloading. My question is: I have all the expansions up to GoD. I have all the expansions downloaded. Is there a way I can buy the expansions from SOE where I can get the keys this morning and upgrade? I dont need the discs right now. Just need the keys. Also I only need the ones for post GoD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PS. I will be going to the store later for the new boxed set so that I will have all the discs. I really dont mind buying the game twice:). I just need some way to get the last few expansions upgraded now:)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The best way has no downloads, the best way is the Titanium package which for $20 will bring you fully up to date except for Prophecy of Ro coming out this week.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;BTW, you can download expansions you don't have yet so you will be all ready to play once you have your registration key.&lt;/P&gt;</description>
