&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Group/RL came with GoD expansion, if I am not mistaken. (This one could be extended quite easily with some nice additions so I will agree with you on those.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Evolving items are a good idea, however it requires a single evolvable item to be tuned and developed as if a single item (so 3 items per evolving entity). Demonstrations of current itemisation means that they are unwilling and/or unable to do a good job on it, so best just to work on 1 item, instead of splitting it into 3.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;MPG Trials are just that, trials. Trials for Mata Muram for his legion. The lore in latter expansions do not have this as a central theme, so they don't have any. Groupable gear is Qvicish standard, with occasional Tacvi standard items here and there, but you have to work for them.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Cursor loot was loot on a silver platter. I am glad they have done away with it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;In EQ you get stuff with an expansion and then you never hear about it again&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With LDoN we got group / raid leader AAs and never a new upgrade.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With&amp;nbsp;DoDH we got evolving items and with the exception of the spirit hunters cloak in PoR they have completly gone away.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Where is the new expansions upgrade to MPG trials&amp;nbsp;from OoW&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Where is the&amp;nbsp;upgrades to the DoDH instanced missions (regarding loot for a win to all not the crappy version introduced in PoR with 1 chestloot only).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am personally quite happy with all those&amp;nbsp;ideas but&amp;nbsp;they seem to be dropped again&amp;nbsp;and never repeated&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>To Prathun: Dude, your statement about the MPG trials maybe being too easy for the rewards boggles my mind. OOW was Sony's last real successful expansion. Look at the zones that are still heavily used even with DoN, DoDH, PoR and TSS. Don't laugh off the success you had with that expansion, rather go back and look at it, ask youself what did we hit there that made it so popular. Then incorporate that into your future expansions. Good challenges, great rewards and let's face it, the armor from Anguish overall is much better than anything since up to the TSS Raid Armor. You want to keep players and your job? Analyze the success, do your math on where the most zone activity is and what is being done there. TSS is a good expansion for the level upgrades, but you missed the boat entirely on your loot drops, whoever did your items needs to go back to past EQs and see what got people hot to grind and push to win. Innovation is a good thing but don't forget to keep your finger on the pulse of the people whose money pays your salary. EQ is a timesink, you're making it too much of a timesink for the return.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I liked them back in the time, although iirc no loot there was interesting for me. Everyone of it had its own feeling and strategy, the move itself brought some exp too and one had to really LEARN them, something rarely given in group content. They were tough (OK I had only entered Inktu'Ta when OoW came out, but was quite well equipped) when first discovered, no walk in the park. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In the start also spells were a carrot to get people there (apart from the stat cap rising) and of course the good old mana clickie for casters (why not hybrids btw?).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I would love some similar group content, tough instance events in an otherwise open zone (so one could go to the zone and just be LFG with the chance for a good enough group for instance) with a (small) reward to beat them all (maybe +2 sv Cor per event?). Other interesting stuff might be illusion clickies or such, they aren't gamebreaking, but always very popular&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I'm not sure if you're referring to the raids or the single-group trials.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As someone mentioned earlier, "trials" wouldn't necessarily make sense in every expansion because the lore doesn't always&amp;nbsp;center around an individual that poses challenges&amp;nbsp;to those who wish to prove themselves.&amp;nbsp; That said, we do&amp;nbsp;have scripted raid encounters every expansion with mechanics that aren't dissimilar to the MPG raids.&amp;nbsp; The difference between Hatchet the Torturer and the Trial of Adaptation is primarily lore. :)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I liked &lt;EM&gt;almost&lt;/EM&gt; everything about the single-group&amp;nbsp;MPG trials.&amp;nbsp; They were challenging, hand-crafted, unique events that required careful and sometimes unusual tactics.&amp;nbsp; My problem with them was that the rewards were substantial... maybe a little too substantial.&amp;nbsp; High level spells, a permanent increase to the resistances hardcap and some incredibly good gear.&amp;nbsp; And I suspect this spike in itemization is one of the main reasons why they were so fondly remembered.&amp;nbsp; Ask yourself, and be completely honest, if the events would have been so popular if the rewards were a shade or two less powerful.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Hi Prathun ill answer that one easy =)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;On my main (mage) i did them solely for the resist upgrade, the loot was not really interesting fo rme at that time.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now a few years later my guild have broken up and im playing a new char (paladin) due to shedule i dont really have any interestign raid options so im forced to do what i can do in 1 group encounters to gear up and the loot from mpg trials are so good that i repeated the fear trial 13 times to get the neck.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Prathun finally how good gear should you be able to get in non raid encounters ? &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The MPG 1 group trials was the hardest 1 group content in OoW and Overlord Mata Muran the hardest raid encounter in same expansion and the trial loot is around 50-60 % of what drops from OMM.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I dont think that is "unfair" considering how hard those trials used to be. (and btw the spell drops from mpg 1 group trials are VERY rare, or ive been VERY unlucky).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And about the MPG trials yes its the carrot hanging in front of you who let you go through the grueling time to get it :smileyhappy:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Since you asked me a question here is one for you, how many raid guilds would still be around if the loot from raidencounters wasnt so good compared to what else you can get ? &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;About the Evolving items here is my 2 CP, on the 3 i got.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Spirit hunters cloak from PoR was very good and very easy to get (call it to easy or not your call =)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The DoDH mask was very hard to get (and its a very good item)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Im also using the range slot (think its the broken sword of illsalin) and while it did take some time to complete i dont think it is that good for a tanking class (even thou its all&amp;nbsp; / all).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also to those who call the DoDH trials a loot feast then my first guess is you dont know what you talk about.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I completed all on my main and didnt loot a single piece, after that ive done all on my alt now and quite a few pieces was all from good to small upgrades but the trials was also far harder, in severel of them i had to ask friends for help becosue i was not able to tank them.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What i really miss is&amp;nbsp;a way for people who arent able to raid&amp;nbsp;to have a chance to get gear without having to resort to sitting in a corner of a zone pulling a ph constantly and hope someone dont run by and KS&amp;nbsp;the named when he finally pop).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Yes i would be interested in some&amp;nbsp;1 group encounters where the loot match the challenge.so im not forced to sit and resort to mindless grinding.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Ive cursed time and again when i did 69.4 and needed to escort the brain dead gnome, over the enchanters who didnt know how to memblur or mez or the pullers who&amp;nbsp;didnt seem to know what chain pull was but when we finally won it was great.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Same with other trials.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I think the trials were popular for the fact they were each unique, they dropped really good gear for the era, and they were instances, which meant they were always up when you wanted them (assuming timers were down).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Personally, the "upgrade" to this that comes to my mind was the freeport arena challenge. Admittedly, it is longer, but it has the similar characteristics of always being ready to go, and yielding a really good result.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In contrast, the random spawn with a possible named, who then drops the item you want (or a mold), can be irritating to some, because of the chance of a bad RNG streak, leading to hours of nothing.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Admittedly, even the trials can drop an item you don't need, but at least you get runes. And you get to see an item, even if nobody needs it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The dod missions were similar, in that they were instances, however, while the loot was kind of close to the quality of PG trial loot, it was several expansions later, and therefore weaker by comparison. Cursor loot was overkill quantity, and imo should rarely be used, if ever.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;While I would not think every expansion would need a full set of "trials" a few really high quality items, from a few instances, popped in here and there (like freeport arena) would be nice.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In fact, I honestly would suggest adding one or two to TSS, that drop weapon upgrades for single groups. Despair is still one of the top groupable weapons, several years later. A 25 dmg, 21 dly 1h and about a 72dmg 38 dly 2h seem like they would be a good level for modern eq groupable top end items.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Of course, the events would have to be as hard now, as PG group trials were when OOW came out.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Treeslayer on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;12-12-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;11:10 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>There are a lot of ways to make things appealing outside of loot.&amp;nbsp; The resist caps where nice.&amp;nbsp; I would of liked to have seen these required as part of CoA access along with signets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Well, as shrouds have been mentioned earlier...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Any hope of rising their skills to the new skill caps ?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;They were not updated when the skill caps changed with TSS.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Shrouds have never been powerful at high level (except for some special abilities, like rogue shroud), and these lower skills make it even worse.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'd add that no lv75 shrouds were added with the level cap rise.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;However i understand this a bit better, as it's probably quite some work,&amp;nbsp;for something that will not be much used.&lt;/DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Where is the new expansions upgrade to MPG trials&amp;nbsp;from OoW&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I'm not sure if you're referring to the raids or the single-group trials.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As someone mentioned earlier, "trials" wouldn't necessarily make sense in every expansion because the lore doesn't always&amp;nbsp;center around an individual that poses challenges&amp;nbsp;to those who wish to prove themselves.&amp;nbsp; That said, we do&amp;nbsp;have scripted raid encounters every expansion with mechanics that aren't dissimilar to the MPG raids.&amp;nbsp; The difference between Hatchet the Torturer and the Trial of Adaptation is primarily lore. :)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I liked &lt;EM&gt;almost&lt;/EM&gt; everything about the single-group&amp;nbsp;MPG trials.&amp;nbsp; They were challenging, hand-crafted, unique events that required careful and sometimes unusual tactics.&amp;nbsp; My problem with them was that the rewards were substantial... maybe a little too substantial.&amp;nbsp; High level spells, a permanent increase to the resistances hardcap and some incredibly good gear.&amp;nbsp; And I suspect this spike in itemization is one of the main reasons why they were so fondly remembered.&amp;nbsp; Ask yourself, and be completely honest, if the events would have been so popular if the rewards were a shade or two less powerful.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However, the beauty lied in that the gear was one of the draws, and imho, not completely out of line with the difficulty. The gear was also only three items per trial, and didn't have massive mods or anything. I thought they were exceptionally well thought out and would love to see ideas like this continue.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I've completed all six individual trials, and probably the only one which I felt needed to be more difficult at the time was destruction.&amp;nbsp;The raid trials are.. well, Hatred is too easy, simply put. Considering it drops the best visible slot (legs) its considerably easier than all the other trials (with the possible exception of Foresight if your raid pays attention easily, or specialization if you have a bunch of good group healers).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Of course, i'm biased, since oow is my favourite expansion =p&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Of course, the loot was good, the AA was very nice, and there was a shot at a spell.&amp;nbsp; These are all solid reasons to do them.&amp;nbsp; That said as a raidier I never looted any items from them, cause I didnt need them.&amp;nbsp; I got all my spells elsewhere as well.&amp;nbsp; I however have done them all several times.&amp;nbsp; They are excellent, reliable, events that you can/could do altho the lockouts could be annoying for the ones you werent doing hehe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Probally not prathun, the loot was part of the draw to those trials.&amp;nbsp; But I loved them.&amp;nbsp; When the expansion was first live, they was hard and I had a blast learning them.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Also include the LDON and DON merchant systems. Each is stand alone to it's expansion even though they are similar. There were no links made between them and neither system has been upgraded since.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; High level spells, a permanent increase to the resistances hardcap &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is why I bothered doing those trials.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;gt; and some incredibly good gear.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I wouldn't call loot that was on par with 2 year old raid loot "incredible". The loot in the trials were not upgrades to me or anyone else I did them with, except on rare occassion someone could upgrade their worst loot with 10-20hp. Considering transportation/clearing/lockout time, the fact that most times all loot rot, and most times no spell rune dropped, I really don't think the rewards from these trials was anywhere near excessive.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
