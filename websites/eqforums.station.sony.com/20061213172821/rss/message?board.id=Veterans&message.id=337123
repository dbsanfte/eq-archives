&lt;P&gt;"As for pet push.. I can sit on one side and&amp;nbsp; bear on other and it will not move at all.&amp;nbsp;"&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Do you have all the pet flurrying AAs?&amp;nbsp; Near as I can tell those are the ones generating the push.&amp;nbsp; How about those swarm pets, such cute PUSHY little buggers, lol--I USE them to push some places because they're so good at it.&amp;nbsp; But of course I have also finished all pet AAs,&amp;nbsp;I didn't used to notice it as much, must be something in there then that makes push go over the top.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I know mage and bst pets push like crazy, anyone who doesn't have their pet AAs all finished probably can't speak to this as well as those who have finished them can--pet push is extreme.&amp;nbsp; Bst can control theirs because they're right there on the mob--mages need to stand still far away, not doable for them-pet off is what you have to control push basically.&amp;nbsp; Not talking about cornering or walling, I'm talking about when you have a mob you're killing for a while in the open that needs to stay where he is.&amp;nbsp; Pets are bad in such cases, period.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>I first saw this in the bug thread and went to test it myself, healing pets now generates aggro. Healing pets has not generated aggro in several years, I believe the original reason had something to do with clerics getting eaten due to the gobs of extra aggro they nabbed by shooting off group heals with pets around. The effect of this nerf (if it was intentional) or bug (if it was not) will be as follows:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Pets as a whole will be banned from many group/raid situations, not for lame reasons like (the way overblown) pet push, but for fully justifiable reasons like "they're killing the cleric".&lt;br&gt;2. The cleric/druid/shaman + magician druids are no longer viable.&lt;br&gt;3 The only method of add control that magicians have, simply healing the pet while two mobs beat on it and hoping for the best, is no longer viable. Magicians are one of the worst high-powered solo classes when it comes to adds. We have no way to pull singles anymore, and we have nothing to do to stop adds once they're aggroed. The magician's only option is to run, gate, or throw whatever they can on their pet and hope it survives against 2/3 mobs. With this change, the magician will heal his pet when the add aggros, and immediately get summoned and destroyed, this is a huge nerf to magician solo power, and the absolute opposite of what we've been hoping for (some way to deal with adds, preferably a pet that can distract them).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Numbers 1 and 3 are the ones I'm particularly concerned about. I'm pretty sure we were told that the devs knew about this and were not going to change it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is not in the magician section and should not be moved to the magician section because it affects all pet classes to some extent or another, I just personally believe it detriments magicians the most.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Just a note on pet as a tank.&amp;nbsp; Soloing it works well, or duo with a healer.&amp;nbsp; And full pet groups can do some incredible damage.&amp;nbsp; That said, a pet cannot compete with a real tank at most levels.&amp;nbsp; I am a mid end raider (Anguish/DP guild) and have an Anguish level pet focus.&amp;nbsp; As such my Air pet well buffed/equipped probably is around 16-17k hp (and earth if I used it could probably get above 20k).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When I group however, its usually with non raiders.&amp;nbsp; And who do we use as a tank?&amp;nbsp; My ranger friend with about 9.3k hp unbuffed (around 12.7k raid buffed I think).&amp;nbsp; Even as just a chain class, he mitigates so much better than my pet its rediculous.&amp;nbsp; And generates far more aggro.&amp;nbsp; And is able to back off from the mob if a heal is running late to give it time (smarter tank).&amp;nbsp; Should he go down my pet can usually hold its own ok for a bit, but the amount of heals required to keep it up compared to the ranger makes this a very mana consuming process.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So I don't picture Pets taking the place of real tanks anytime soon.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And ty Rashere for working on this for us, glad it is to be fixed soon :)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Sounds like Wingz is planning on rolling up a mage. I hope so, and make sure you that you come and tell us how your omnipotent death machine is doing. And if its all you hoped for. &lt;span&gt;:smileyvery-happy:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Better yet, try this one...get a warrior and cleric, add slower and some dps, including a mage--go to Valdeholm and slaughter stuff.&amp;nbsp; No hassling with disband-reinvite of the two clerics, just sheer dps and AA'ing ftw!&amp;nbsp; lol&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Oh you can add some dps outside the group if you want, so long as they don't KS, thats better than healing outside group shenanigans, lol.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;"Ok, why do you keep thinking pets have some insane amount of hps?"&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Well I will admit to this one.&amp;nbsp; hehe.&amp;nbsp; Mage pet with gear and buffs and good focus is nice on hp now, no doubt.&amp;nbsp; They should have, its time our pets didn't die to the AEs on raids etc. --well swarm pets are no good there but oh well.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

So, yes, as far as push goes magician warrior pets (air/earth) and beastlord warders have the most, even though it still isn't as much as your average melee, or even your average meleeing druid. And the magician water pet probably pushes less than the magician's nukes, since it doesn't kick/stun/bash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"However I can't say on a raid, yes he can have a pet, but no you can't because you're too stupid to control it.'&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You sure can, and you sure should.&amp;nbsp;Well&amp;nbsp;maybe&amp;nbsp;don't use the word "stupid," but you can say "Your pet is causing problems,&amp;nbsp;please suspend."&amp;nbsp; See how easy that is?&amp;nbsp; Of course, you have to be aware enough to know which pet and which owner caused the problem, but if you don't, you have no business giving these kinds of instructions till you know exactly what happened anyway.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Personally I expect people to not have to have their hand held to play their class, but if they are still new and really can't play it well yet, I don't offend everyone to avoid offending them.&amp;nbsp; I tell them exactly what they're doing wrong, and exactly what they need to do differently.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If being &lt;STRONG&gt;taught&lt;/STRONG&gt; offends them,&amp;nbsp;I say "Go now, don't let the door hit you on the way out."&amp;nbsp; If you don't play your class right, you get to be told how to play it.&amp;nbsp; You talk to the person you need to talk to, not to everyone in general.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Worried about offending the poor player by targeting the communication to the one responsible?&amp;nbsp;Don't be.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Instead, worry about offending all the others who play well.&amp;nbsp; They should not be offended because they've done nothing to warrant this kind of treatment.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;On that note, can we&amp;nbsp;stop saying "KILL PETS"&amp;nbsp; on raids (who thought that up?).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You say "Suspend pets," "Pets off," or "Hold pets."&amp;nbsp; Its not rocket science, its easy, try it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The&amp;nbsp;ubiquitous insulting of pet classes (saying KILL PETS as if they're bad is offensive, for example)&amp;nbsp;is a holdover from when mostly kids played this game, imo--back then, rude talk was the norm, pet classes being one of the accepted targets for it.&amp;nbsp; Rudeness is juvenile, get it?&amp;nbsp; Pet classes can be good players, and I expect them to be--if they are not, that person who doesn't play well plays without a pet--JUST them.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And pet push is extreme once you get all your flurry AAs, etc.&amp;nbsp; It is a problem, and you don't run around in a raid to position your pet, you miss group heals that way, for example.&amp;nbsp; And there are many solutions that have been suggested,&amp;nbsp;one or more of which&amp;nbsp;need to be implemented. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Fd, snare, root mez still dont allow those classes to engage 3 mobs at once. Pull them, sure, engage and battle all three at once: NO. But thats why you chose your words carefully and said "pull".&amp;nbsp; Whether the damage shield is the nice mage ds or a cleric mark or a druid damage shield, allowing a mage or cleric or druid to heal a pet with three mobs on it to heal with no agro consequences to the healer is unbalanced. No class can actively handle and engage three mobs in current content, they would have to try to root two of them which isnt too likely before an evac would be necessary or mez two of them or fd to lose agro and watch their pet die. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Pet heals with no agro to the healer creates a disconnect that should not be intended. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As far as killing mobs in WoS as a beastlord, solo,&amp;nbsp; the beastlord pet should hold agro if it has the current stun procs from 1.5 and 2.0 and lairn along with regular pet taunt. Beyond WoS, there is no way for a beastlord to solo with a pet offtanking really. You have to keep agro on yourself and hope your ac, hps and heals keep you up long enough to dps one mob down. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have not tested the heals in WoS solo, but I have seen my pet hold agro on adds even with heals from me or another player since the 12/5 patch. I dont see this as an issue that would affect beastlords in current content at all because our pets really cant offtank and losing the beastlord's dps to keep a pet alive with chain heals in not an option. Generally, I will get agro on the original mob and engage the add with protective spirit on and hope that my healer can keep me alive to beat down one of the mobs and then focus on the original mob.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;This is a joke, right?&amp;nbsp; As a necro I usually&amp;nbsp;eliminate&amp;nbsp;the 3 spawn at the start of 69.1 hard by kiting all 3 at once .&amp;nbsp; If I bother to pull the basements or upper levels of the buildings I can end up with as many as 5 at a time.&amp;nbsp; They all end up dead and I don't even keep root mem'd.&amp;nbsp; I can pull off the same sort of thing in every TSS zone barring Ashen/FC.&amp;nbsp; Yes, that includes Vergalid and Valdeholm.&amp;nbsp; I'm sure there are wizzies, druids, shamans, and possibly rangers that can do the same (though the latter would be like watching paint dry).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Everyone claiming that mages are overpowered due to possibly soloing 2 dark blues at once or 3 if duoing with a healer needs to stop and&amp;nbsp;consider the fact that we are talking about gimp content.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Seriously, when was the last time a mage + healer duo blew past your FC/Ashen group?&amp;nbsp; Is it really so terrible that a mage might be able to handle an add or two in a mid-end xp zone from 4 expansions and 5 levels ago (since several posts have mentioned WoS)?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Shake off the myopia concerning "no heal aggro, OMGZ!" for a moment and think about this on a practical level.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you can't see the obvious deficiencies inherent in pet tanks and why they will never compare to a real tank in anything but trivial content/situations you are just deluded.&amp;nbsp; Consider the implications of melee range aggro behavior, the utter absence of AE and snap aggro abilities, the craptastic mitigation, etc.&amp;nbsp; Have you ever noticed the conspicuous absence&amp;nbsp;of posts complaining about mages being overpowered or unbalanced?&amp;nbsp; This is not a coincidence.&amp;nbsp; A lot of us - who don't play mages btw - have known about this for years and guess what?&amp;nbsp; We don't mind because it is good for the mages and doesn't hurt anyone else.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;To sum up: the only source that gets to decide if aggro free heals on pets are "intended" &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;are the DEVS.&amp;nbsp; They have already stated that the change is UNINTENDED.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The system has been coded this way for years, not days or weeks or months.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Therefore it's either intended, or its a side effect of other issues that would be caused&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;if it were changed, or the devs are all completely unaware of how their game has been working&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;and pet classes are about to be hit with a ridiculously large nerf bat.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;But please, keep on telling us how our class should be nerfed into oblivion because&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;how our class works doesn't suit you.&amp;nbsp; Then have fun when there is no one to coth you because&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;we all left to play WOW :)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;P.S. Mages could NOT actively engage three dark blue mobs in current content by themselves.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With a cleric box, perhaps.. just like a warrior, SK, pally, ranger, beastlord, etc. etc. could.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;With this change we cannot even actively engage three GREEN mobs in current content.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The absolute retardedness of this thread, and some of the poeple posting is amazing. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
No class can actively handle and engage three mobs in current content,&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And neither can mages. HOWEVER. Mages + cleric&amp;nbsp;(or) shammy can. A warrior plus healer CAN, any number of other classes together can. Basically what your whining about is someone else might be boxing and since you arent thay shouldnt either. Try making your arguement at least make sense. It takes 2 classes to do what your saying.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;400PT ds? wheres this? If im lucky, i can get about 85 DS on my pet. Show me 3 real exp mobs that wont eat my pet before the first cleric heal hits. Im on The Nameless. Ill be waiting. OR are you talking about 3 light blue mobs that give less than 1% per mob. Because your really off base now. Im certianly going to track down a cleric to agro free heal my pet for 1.5% AA when i can just pop over to Icefall and solo one for 8-9% just as fast by myself. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If this all bugs you so much, delete and make a mage. Your going to find out quickly that the life is far from the rosey parade your uniformed mind has grasped.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

But the problem is the answer to these theories have already been decided before you even took the time to form them. If this was the case where a mage + Cleric is better than any other duo or even group in the game why isn't every single casual player in the game either a mage or a cleric? it's not like this is a proposed change its been this way for YEARS, i'm sorry but you fail to grasp this concept. You say that all these things will happen if the bug gets removed, but history has proved you otherwise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You fail at logic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;So far, I am really enjoying my "away from EQ while this bug persists" time, my little gnome warlock is now in his mid teen levels. Also it has been awesome to really be only 2 clicks away from a game, rather than 2 clicks, and close to a minute waiting for a game.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also no zoning, eventhough the seperate zones (by map) are easily as large as everquest zones. The voidwalker is a really nice pet though I must admit, I like the look of my warder more than his look, but at least this warlock I can heal without going splut, so at the moment the warlock is a hell of a lot more fun to play than the beastlord.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Ahh, well 7 more free trials days left, before I decide which subscription to continue, surely they'll have fixed this issue before that, so I can go back to my good old troll, I do miss his crack (And not talking about Spiritual Ascendance either) ;-p&lt;/P&gt;</description>
