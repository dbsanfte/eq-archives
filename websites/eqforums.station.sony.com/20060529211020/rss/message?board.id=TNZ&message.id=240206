    <title>Guild Question??</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=TNZ&amp;message.id=240206</link>
    <description>&lt;div&gt;Can someone explain to me how the guild hall works? What are the roles of the Guild Banker and the Guild Tribute? Should I contribute to either of them? How does corpse recovery work? Do I have to wait a specific time period before my corpse can be recovered? I tried looking in this forum for something to explain how these things work, but I couldn't find anything. If there's some web sites out there with this information, please direct me. Thanks a bunch in advance.:smileyhappy:&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;guild hall features / benefits:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1- buff timers are frozen.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Get buffed in the GH and the timers won't start counting down till you leave.&amp;nbsp; Esp. useful if you need to afk but not necessarily&amp;nbsp;log off, and have the time to park yourself there (as opposed to emergency/unexpected afks)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2-Meditation pool.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Sit in the pool and your mana and HPs will regen at double the rate.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Portal.&lt;/STRONG&gt; Buy a port stone from the gnome and hand it back to him, and you can port to a few different destinations.&amp;nbsp; The great thing is multiple people can use the portal to go to the same destination, and only need to buy another port stone when a new destination is required...thus useful to move an entire raid...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Tradeskill containers.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; IS poK too crowded or distracting? Sit in the nice quiet guild hall to do your combines.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Augmentation sealer.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; (birdbath) Add augments to your gear, or remove them&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7. NPC merchant.&lt;/STRONG&gt; Sells food &amp;amp; water and augmentation removal potions, and will buy your vendor loot if you forgot to unload before you zoned in.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8. Personal banker.&lt;/STRONG&gt; convenient, esp if you think ahead and fill it with your tradeskill components so you dont need to zone out to PoK :)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9. Guild Banker.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; useful for guilds to share gear, tradeskill &amp;amp; quest items&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10. Guild Tribute person.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; tribute effects for teh whole guild, you must right click and tick teh "opt in" box in order to get any benefit from the effects.&amp;nbsp; Also can donate to this NPC (most convenient for guild bankers unloading raid loot, they don't have to zone out to PoK and climb the tower where the other Guild Tribute NPC is located).&amp;nbsp; NOTE: only the leader or a guild officer can turn Guild Tribute on or off, which generally means it's reserved for use on raids....&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;11. Future features?&lt;/STRONG&gt; there are doors that lead nowhere at the moment, many suggestions have been made....maybe one day we will see one or more implemented...&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Corpse Summoning Altar&lt;/STRONG&gt; is in the &lt;U&gt;Guild Lobby.&lt;/U&gt;&amp;nbsp; Buy the soulstone that corresponds to your level, give it to a summoner NPC and your body will be summoned from anywhere in Norrath (except Shadowrest if your corpse was too old and was sent there.&amp;nbsp; Then all you need is a cleric to rez you (usually is at least one cleric in the lobby willing to rez for donations...)&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span&gt;hp pool.  You will need DoN expansion to be able to use any of these features.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Guild banker is for items that you like anyone in the guild to use (few people in the guild will have the ability to flag items for other people or classes or for anyone).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Guild Tribute is intended for raid type enhanced buffs.  Contribute as you like.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In guild lobby you can have your corpse summoned anytime when you give the appropriate level summon item to one of the summoners.  Summon item (I forget the name) can be purchased depending upon the level of summoned corpse(s).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Thanks. That does explain a lot, but it leads to a couple more questions ..... If I put something into the guild bank, can I get it back? If I contribute to the Guild Tribute npc, can I use the tribute buffs? I guess what I'm confused about is WHY would I contribute to the Guild Bank/Guild Tribute and WHAT benefits do I get from doing so? Thanks again.</description>

Thanks again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, why would you use the guild bank?  Let's say that you are a young member of the guild and some of the higher ups are out adventuring and they get some gear to drop.  It is really nothing they would use but they figure that the guild might have people that could use it.  So rather than selling it in the bazaar to make a little money or donate it to their personal tribute master in their hometown, they donate it to the guild bank. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now one day you are starting to feel like your armor is getting to be just a little under where you feel it should be.  I mean, that 20AC Netherbian Chitin was good for a while but you are getting older now and have been looking at upgrading.  You look in the guildbank and see that there is a nice Dented Brass Cuirass that is AC30 and has some ok stats to go with it that a guildy put in for someone to use.  It is certainly an upgrade, and you would like it.  In some guilds it might be setup for anyone to take if they can use it and you simply withdraw it.  In other others you might have to use points earned by doing things with the guild to buy it from the guild with points or you might simply have to post your desire to get it on a guild website so that someone with the proper ability to get it out could get it and give it to ya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that Netherbian Chitin you are upgrading from are a dime a dozen and you can buy them on vendors for 5p all the time so you likely won't make any real money from it in the bazaar and most people in guild probably won't need it so you can turn it in for guild tribute if you like and everyone in the guild gets to use the abilities setup by those who can do such things with the tribute master.  You could also turn it into your own Tribute Master in your hometown.  If you turn it in to the guild tribute master, you are helping all of the guild keep the tribute benefits going that much longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being in a guild is usually about helping each other and should be.  As a guildy with a high fletching skill I expect to make combines for free or if I need to buy things I expect to simply be re-imbursed for materials whereas normal people would get a markup or sometimes pay a fee to get the combine done.  Guild banks and tribute are no different.  They are ways of helping the guild and in turn, helping yourself.  At the upper levels, maybe it means turning Muramite Runes into the Guild Bank so others can get their spells rather than selling them and making some money for example.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guild leader will assign 1+ members to be guild bankers.  If you deposit somethiing to guildbank, usualy that means you are donating it for anyone in guild to use.  If you want the item to go to a specific person only, you need to tell the banker ahead of time so they can set the proper removal rights (public access, public if usable-for class specific things, single person-they type in a name, banker access only).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't know about all guilds, but the ones I've seen have frowned upon someone using guildbank as additional bank space for themselves, so if I misunderstood what you said about taking something back out I apologize.  Yes, a banker can assign the single person name to the person who put it in or can put public access on something and you can remove it that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding tribute.  There are 2 forms of tribute - personal tribute (that you, yourself, can only donate to and you have to set your tribute rights of what you want in your home town) and then there is guild tribute.  There is a cap of 250,000 tribute I believe that a person can have as single personal tribute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guilds have the eoption to allow their members to gain additional mana, hp, resists, etc. by the guild tribute (the person in guild hall as well as in the top of one of the spires).  However, to participate in this, you have to go to them and turn yourself on for guild tribute, so that when it is running, you feel the benefits - just because guild tribute is running, if you haven't turned yourself on, you won't get the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raid tribute costs are NOT cheap (and there is a 500,000 cap on guild tribute) because for every person who joins in, the price goes up; there is no flat fee for 1-100 raiders being on at a time.  So donating to is is beneficial, and especially if you use it during raids yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
