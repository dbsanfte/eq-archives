<P><BR>why would anyone anymore gear mains or alts here? there is so much better gear available via missions and quests, minus good clickies of course.</P>

<P>i do agree that this zone needs looked into though, im not keyed, and since no one ever goes there, highly doubt ill bother with it, its easier to get VT groups/raids then it is for VP. they need to do something to make this place worthwhile going to, and forcing certain races to kill here for tradeskill drops really wasnt the answer, lol.</P>
