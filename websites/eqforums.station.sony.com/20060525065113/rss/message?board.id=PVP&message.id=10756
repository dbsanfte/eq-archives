      <title>PvP and chokeholding a server</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=10206#M10206</link>
      <description>Hi, this is a fairly serious topic that I have seen discussed a lot, but not very much has been done to adress it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Currently, the rules regarding when disputes should be settled by PvP vs by PnP were outlined by Kefyra after wording her request in a way to get a specific answer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those rules are the worst set of rules to ever guide a PvP server.  It makes PvP nothing more than a total zerg number fest, takes away any strategy element, and makes guilds who are not at the top of progression absolutely irrelevant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's assume for a minute, Ascending Dawn decided to war a guild lower in progression then them.  With the extremly asine rules that were layed out, AD would have total freedom to wreck every single raid by the lower level guild, take their mob and laugh at them, and should the lower level guild try to retaliate by attacking Ascending Dawn on a raid, AD could just petition a GM and ask a GM to give a warning to all of the opposing guild, for attacking a mob without sufficient force to kill it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is incredibly asine, and leads to an effect where who is on top now can attack anyone's raids at their leisure, while claiming immunity from any attack, because the content they are doing is beyond whoever is likely to attack them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On RZ, time and time again, a little guild would win fights against bigger guild, through better PvP skill, stronger perseverance, more willingness to fight and go on without raiding.  Under the current rule set, a big guild could petition to have all its raids PvP free, since smaller guilds clearly are not likely to be able to take targets that bigger guilds raid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason why I draw a line between training and attacking people engaged is based on a simple philosophy.  When a guild choose to engage in an event, knowing full well that there are other guilds who are aggressive towards them, they make the conscious choice of 'exposing' themselves to PvP, and be ready for PvP to be brought on them.  Training on the other hand is something that is brought upon a guild who did nothing to facilitate it.  If someone choose to run into mobs and feigns death low on health, that's that person's fault for running into mobs, he went ahead and made himself vulnerable by this action.  If someone decides to experience in a zone where he can be attacked, that's his choice, but he knows that makes him more vulnerable to attacks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The definition that the only time of PvP acceptable is 100 vs 100 is stupid, because those type of fights have almost zero tactics, devolve into massive zergfests, and are decided sheerly by numbers, and it also skews the server to force people to form zerg alliance in their own time zone just to stay competitive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Among the top four guilds, Hate, Defiant, Ascending Dawn, PDM, Hate for example is the only guild to not have progressed past Qvic, or having won any MPG trials/RS royalty.  They however are probably the guild who is the most used to dealing with disruption on their events, which should be a huge advantage.  Defiant and PDM have formed an alliance, and raid together with numbers well beyond what any single guild on their timezone is able to field.  Does this mean that when Defiant and PDM are zerging RS royalty with 100+ in zone, they should not be attacked by any guild who cannot field 100+ themselves?  This type of enforcement of only allowing straight up PvP cheapens the entire Pvp experience.  People become just numbers, you cannot have clever tactics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every time PDM has been defeated through the use of superior strategy, they have petitioned a GM complaining about how unfair the tactics used against them where, yet when servers crash, they quickly hurry outside an instance to pick off people as they log back in and are booted outside before they gain control, this is smart, it is attacking people while they are the most vulnerable.  I am fine with this tactic, but if killing people while they are ungrouped after an incident which they had no control over is fine, why is attacking people after they intentionally made themselves more vulnerable frowned upon?</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Man for one and last time,&amp;nbsp; SZ dont PvP they were USed to Train&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;as all the post on SZ guild Forum said:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"We beat them we make an amazing train"&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;as Leader of one guild said, "he is god training"&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;as some post of the&amp;nbsp;Hate guild said:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"We will introduce them the Rezz Window Training" &amp;lt;-- RUn with train mob to a group with a rezz window ready to warp.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"DoZ" and "Hate" and "Ascending Dawn"&amp;nbsp; for then are normaly to use /warp succor_zone.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;i mean all server you see that but now is normaly you have someone in target/Snared and ready to die and Puff they at Zonein.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To Refrase and Resume: GM/SONYQ dont care if they warp, GM Dont care if they Train, GM Dont Care if they Hack, GM Dont Care if they Ninja Loot.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;PnP Policy were well set in VZ, there is no more VZ, its ZEK.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Of course they will do something if they Catch anyone doing (they wont have other options) but like whne you Petition GM will come 2 Day laters and said there is no way cuase he wasnt there.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In Fact i' strating to think GM dont Care PvP Server is too much trouble for then, let just put or ZEK togheter with the Train Server.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;if SZ is dieng maybe all server will die and we&amp;nbsp; finally end with PvP Server.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If they care about Hack/PvP/Warp/NinjaLoot/etc they will be lot of BANNED people.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I mean any GM online for more than 3 hours just watching teh right people will BAN in a rate fo 10 per day.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;We had kickass pvp fights too, no mobs involved.&amp;nbsp; It's good tactics and pvp practice, you guys should try it sometime.&amp;nbsp; You don't even have to go to an arena to do it.&amp;nbsp; Hell you can do it in Txevu, wanna? &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Roofin gets his hacks from ATL aka Destiny of Zek's Airyth, Atlkrew, Kaerix, Taowel.&amp;nbsp; 90% of DoZ hack and provide hacks to members of Ascending Dawn, Eximos (hi Tekas), Sendiaz, Roofin, and a few others i am forgetting.&amp;nbsp; Several AD members are also boxed by these people to exploit several events in EQ (Qvic) -- Bakamaf and Winasben are two people that i have personally seen being boxed by ATL.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;To those that say pdm only wins through zerg, I strongly disagree.&amp;nbsp; They also win through dishonorable tactics.&amp;nbsp; My first encounter went something like this -- I'm tanking a mob in MPG.&amp;nbsp; PDM mez's my group's cleric and attacks my group's shaman while they watch me eat exp death to the mob due to lack of heals.&amp;nbsp; Was only six of them to four of us, hardly a zerg.&amp;nbsp; So since they didn't have well over twice our numbers, they went to their backup plan, which is, &amp;nbsp;"when you can't zerg, use cheap, dishonorable, unsportsmanlike tactics to win at any cost -- don't ever let someone have a fair fight no matter what".&amp;nbsp; Those of you that have had run-ins with pdm should know this strat as well as their main strat of, "ally with any really strong guild and zerg everyone else".&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Defiant does not C-block guilds by attacking them while engaged with raid mobs. Rayven already made a post stating publically our polices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If your in a Tier_2 guild on zek and are kos to defiant and are in PvE vs an EP God. If you are engaged with that mob and 50 defiant zone in, you have nothing to fear from us while your fighting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If your still clearing to the mob, or the mob is dead, you are free game. However if the mob has been killed, after PvP (assuming we win), we will rez those of you back who are to be awarded your loot, because if we're coming after a guild, we're after them for pvp, not for the ill feeling of 2 or 3 pieces of loot that we can obtain in an hour or two's work elsewhere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is where Defiant and Ascending Dawn differ. It is one of our willingness to goto lengths to ruin the 'weaker' guys fun. We don't want to do that, all I see Ascending Dawn officers post here, is there willingness to goto any lengths so long as they can win. To me that says, you guys are very poor in defeat. When your beat you can't be stand up enough to say good fight, well done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a game, not a real war - in games there are winners and losers, sometimes you will win, sometimes you will lose. If you can't fight fairly, give each other a /salute after the fight and move on with your day, then your a pretty weak or immature when it comes to handling victory and defeat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've been involved in 1 of the 2 times we've lost to in mass pvp, and both times no training happened. No attacking on mobs happened. It was guild vs guild pvp, how pvp is supposed to be. We didn't spend the next hour repeatidly zerging them, we accepted our loss and moved on. This is the kind of atmosphere i'd see flourish on Zek, as opposed to one of ill feeling and bitterness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't know about the rest of you, but I want to enjoy the time I play EQ on Zek.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cya on the battlefield&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peoni Greenleaf&lt;br&gt;Officer of Defiant</description>

&lt;P&gt;As I am the only officer of Ascending Dawn to post here, I can only assume that is directed at me.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I can assure you that we have no interest in stopping "weaker guys" in any way. In fact, our history shows that we have supported "weaker guys" on RZ, going out of our way to ensure that they can progress.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We also have no interest in "going to any lengths" to ruining anybody's fun, let alone weaker guilds. This was a debate about the ruleset, and up until now I felt it was pretty civilised.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you, or anyone in your guild, have complaints about AD members, please feel free to provide me with specifics rather than broad-brush innuendo and propaganda. I have asked for&amp;nbsp;details before. I have even been to your board and PMed one of your officers to remind them to send me details so I could follow up on complaints. So far I have received nothing.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Feel free to PM me or any of our officers, or mail me in game at any time. All of our members know that they have to abide with the server rules fully.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I think the real problem is the hacking. Hell if one group wants to zone in and mess with a raid oh well fine they will die. i dont care how skilled you are, 1 group will not survive against 60 people. Where the problem arises is that most of the groups that do this are all running warp,speed and stun hacks making them virtually unkillable. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So personally id really like to know where this so called pvp skill come from? Does it come from the MQ2 site or perhaps it comes from being able to compile the source? or maybe even beign skilled enough to do a search on google for the plugin source?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;I believe some of you are mostly mistaken regarding Hate and training.&amp;nbsp; I've been on most, if not all, of the major PVP battles and none of them have been trained.&amp;nbsp; Training isn't as widespread as everyone bleeding is acting like it is.&amp;nbsp; I'm sure it looks better on the forums to cry training, but it's really not the case.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also, anyone sad about being pvp'd while on a CR or while fighting a mob needs to just get over it.&amp;nbsp; I dont believe either, minus doing it to the point of harassment, is illegal, so it's honestly up to the perspective of the pvper.&amp;nbsp; If you cant accept that it's going to happen, just movelog to another server.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Stidjron, Hate&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;However, if I zoned in and they hadn't yet engaged the boss, I would see it as perfectly&amp;nbsp;fair to engage them. I don't care how many people I have, and don't see that as relevant in any way. I am thinking of Camby's suggestion that I should have to have 50% of my opponents force or I shouldnt attack. &amp;nbsp;If I have too few people and get crushed, that is my problem. Whether I have enough is a personal judgement. 2 groups can cause a raid of 50 a lot of problems after all.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;There is absolutely nothing wrong with this Raitsila,&amp;nbsp;if your guild's 2 groups want to run a suicide mission against a raid force of 60, that's perfectly with in your rights.&amp;nbsp; The problem lies in how and when you attend to launch your attack.&amp;nbsp; If you choose to train all the npc's from the zone line to your enemies raid force, this is wrong.&amp;nbsp; If you choose to attack the raid force after they have engaged their raid objective ( Raid Level Mob as Defined by SoE ) by mezzing / killing your enemies members while engaged on their objective, this is wrong.&amp;nbsp; You are within your rights if they chose to attack you when they are already engaged, to defend yourself appropriately, remembering in doing so that you do your best to avoid causing undo experience deaths.&amp;nbsp; If a enemy ranger attacks you, you can kill him, if his cleric heals him, you can kill the cleric too, but if the ranger attacks and you Manaburn the Main Tank, this is wrong.&amp;nbsp; The intention of the 50% balance of your enemies raid force only serves the purpose to constitute the legitimacy of an attack of one guild vs. another guild over an objective MoB.&amp;nbsp; Lets give an example for the sake of argument.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Lets say PDM is preparing to engage the CBQ with 70 people.&amp;nbsp; In zones a group of Hate, but PDM has yet to engage CBQ.&amp;nbsp; Hate is more than welcome to attack PDM, even greatly outnumbered as they may be.&amp;nbsp; The Hate get pwned but they continue to return to the zone, over and over again, harassing PDM and not allowing them to engage the CBQ.&amp;nbsp; If PDM then does engage the CBQ and Hate attacks using the excuse " we were already engaged in PvP " even after they have warp hacked / succored away from PvP and subsequently cause PDM to wipe the raid, Hate has broken the PnP.&amp;nbsp; ONLY if Hate had a substantial force of 35 ( 1/2 of PDM's numbers ) should they be allowed to legitimately fight PDM for the rights to CBQ or subsequently to stop PDM's progression.&amp;nbsp; One group coming back again and again isn't PvP, its griefing.&amp;nbsp; If you intend on fighting your enemy for a MoB or to stop them from doing a MoB, then you should STAY and FIGHT, not run / harass / run / harass / run / harass.&amp;nbsp; To do this is an exploit of the PnP, this is why on Vallon we had our LnS rule.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Everquest PvP has to be balanced with PvE to keep the game exciting.&amp;nbsp; Without the Play Nice Policies, Zek would be in a state of anarchy, there would be no progression, we'd all simply be running around Nektulos forest in our patchwork tunics weilding tarnished 2 handed swords at level 10.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Long story short, when engaging in PvP you should ask yourself these 3 questions:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; Do we have an adequate force to fight this guild and stand any legitimate chance of winning if&amp;nbsp;our enemy wasn't engaged in PvE&amp;nbsp;?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Can we reasonably engage&amp;nbsp;without causing&amp;nbsp;undo experience loss to our enemies ?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; Do we have an adequate force to fight the Target NPC ?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If the answer is NO to any of these 3 questions, then you shouldn't&amp;nbsp;disrupt the &lt;STRONG&gt;main raid force &lt;/STRONG&gt;with PvP.&amp;nbsp; You might argue&amp;nbsp;that you are after the same Target NPC as your enemy, but&amp;nbsp;if you cannot gain&amp;nbsp;control of&amp;nbsp;the spawn&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;reasonable and&amp;nbsp;legitimate means, then&amp;nbsp;you are just SoL.&amp;nbsp; Kill them after the MoB is dead or before they reach their target.&amp;nbsp; You might lose with lower numbers, but you might slow their progression enough to allow more of your own to log on and actually contend for the Target.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;These 3 questions are guidelines that if you are willing to adhere to the PnP's that you can use as guidelines of engagement.&amp;nbsp; If you want to attack your enemy, do so with the intent to actually &lt;STRONG&gt;fight &lt;/STRONG&gt;him/her, not fight until you have to gate, then return and repeat over and over.&amp;nbsp; If you are beat, then stay beat and if you win, your enemy needs to bow out and do the same.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Camby, I think where we differ is that you have this underlying assumption that it is only OK to attack a raid force if you intend to take the mob/encounter that they are preparing to engage.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think that it is OK to attack a raid force simply because they are your enemy. "Winning" doesn't necessarily mean killing all of the enemy. It could be holding them up, delaying them, frustrating them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I agree on point 2 "Can we reasonably engage&amp;nbsp;without causing&amp;nbsp;undo experience loss to our enemies ?" and this this is covered by the server ruleset already.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I also agree that "If you are beat, then stay beat and if you win, your enemy needs to bow out and do the same." However, I do see the use of succor, CoH etc. as perfectly valid tactics and not an indication that you are "beat".&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I see there is a new post from Ashlanne. If the ruleset is changed I will comply with it. However, I do have some questions as to whether this is a bona fide ruleset change that I will post on her thread.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
