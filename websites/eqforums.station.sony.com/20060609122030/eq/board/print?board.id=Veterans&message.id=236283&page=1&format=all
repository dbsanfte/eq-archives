				<DIV></DIV>yttrium does drop better than piles of gravel, but reptile teeth are even MORE ridiculous. I actually had good luck in the hole for gravel, but only past the city, before that it bit. Of course, I was not looking for it either, just happened to get a bunch while doing other things down there. Made some guildees happy with it though.

				There is for sure some huge differences in the ease of master level
armor drops between races.&nbsp; Like huge as in, on one hand nearly
trivial, on the other, so ridiculous its not worth it. <br>
<br>
However, I'm not sure that asking for revamps of old zone content is
the answer to fix things.&nbsp; More likely it should either be,
A)&nbsp; change the required drops for certain racial armor or B) allow
the items to drop off similar mobs in different zones. <br>
<br>
Like Pile of Gravel:<br>
<b>Plane of Nightmare</b> a weathered gargoyle (Level: 57)<br>
<b>Ruins of Old Paineel</b> (The Hole) a broken gargoyle (Levels: 56 -
58) a crumbling gargoyle (Levels: 46 - 48) a destroyed gargoyle
(Levels: 46 - 47)a ruined gargoyle (Levels: 48 - 53)a stone ward
(Levels: 55 - 58) an ancient gargoyle (Level: 55) an old gargoyle
(Level: 49)<br>
<b>The Ruined City of Dranik</b> a malfunctioning stoneworker (Level: 66) a transmuted stoneworker (Ruined City of Dranik) (Levels: 64 - 68)<br>
<br>
Vs my troll armor<br>
<b>Plane of Nightmare</b> a tar`dak hunter (Level: 54)<br>
<b>Veeshan's Peak</b> a lava basilisk (Veeshan's Peak) (Levels: 60 - 64) Magma Basilisk (Level: 65)<br>
<b>Vegarlson, the Earthen Badlands</b>A Needlescale Basilisk (Levels: 63 - 64)<br>
<br>
PoN is common between the two.&nbsp; But the drop rate for teeth is
just absurd.&nbsp; I heard someone above say something about a stack(s)
of piles of gravel... I don't think I've ever been able to stomach
farming more than 3 teeth at a time in PoN.&nbsp; Thats quite a few
hours for a few teeth.&nbsp; For loot that is not sold that often, and
for skillups that are much easier to get via Shadowscream.<br>
<br>
The remaining zones, lets compare:<br>
VP and PoEarth...vs... the Hole and Rcod.<br>
<br>
See any problems there? The plane of earth vs the hole hehe.&nbsp; Or
VP vs the hole.&nbsp; Its not even on the same playing field in terms
of difficulty.&nbsp; And two very difficult keyed zones vs one easy key
zone?&nbsp; What gives?<br>

				Personally I did everyone of the quests from VP for my twink Zure at
the time they came out. I even did a couple for my cleric as well. At
the time they were better than some pieces of gear you could get from
raids with focus effects. In today's standards they woudln't be worth
the effort of the rare drops but it was fun gaining the faction and
actually working on the quest. <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br>

<P>Zajeer, thanks for the detailed response.&nbsp; Interesting to see a designer's point of view.</P>
<P>My biggest frustration with this zone, is like another person alluded to.&nbsp; Mob density.&nbsp; It's not easy getting folks to come here, and working this zone solo...it's difficult to make headway against the sheer number of mobs.&nbsp; Once you leave the ZI area, ever single pull involves a split.</P>
<P>I realize you didn't take this isnto account when you designed it, as it was intended as a raid zone. Anyway, thank you again for taking the time to set me straight on some things.</P>

I added in a "gateway" dragon that was roughly as difficult as a tier3 god in POP would limit the access to players that was on the verge of being elemental flagged. I wanted to make a "faster" access pathway into the zone instead of camping the old key mobs, so I introduced an alternate method of getting the items needed for the key, which was a faster method, but required a group.

<P><BR>I understand your reasoning, but being from a guild that has passed that point I had to run thorugh the old key quest on my own to be able to zone in and then had that taken away from me.</P>

<P>Perhaps it is just me, but I dislike having something taken away from me for what seems to be an "Arbitrary" decision.&nbsp; You felt that "under the old key quest, getting access to an elemental planes level zone (in terms of difficulty and reward via exp/loot) would have been too easy" so you introduced a raid required mob for access.</P>

<LI>MPG Trials only require a single group and drop better loot.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>A variety of OoW/DoD Rares that can be duoed, drop better loot.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>Quests rewards in PoR that can be duoed and soloed offer better loot.</LI></UL>
<P>Point is, trying to get&nbsp;a raid together for the sole fact of getting myself re-keyed (since what does it offer to anyone else in my guild) is fruitless.&nbsp; Perhaps it is time to allow the old key re-entry on its own merits (just don't give it the Augment Change without doing the raid).</P>

				Man, this is a silly thread.&nbsp; What would prompt you to do a "review" of a zone revamp that happened like 2 years ago?&nbsp; Will we be seeing you complain about how lower guk just doesn't have any good upgrades for level 70s next?<br><br>At the time VP was a really fun zone with some very original boss fights.&nbsp; Testing it with Zajeer was one of the funnest things I've done in EQ, and I am now Qvic-MPG level but still wearing the breastplate I got from VP (although it's definitely due for an upgrade <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-tongue.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0>).&nbsp; VP's only downfall as an exp/raid zone was the fact that as good as it was, the quests were even better, and a lot of guilds never raided there because their members didn't want to lose faction.&nbsp; Personally I did all of the quests and used most of the items for months or years.&nbsp; <br><br>That said, it might be a good time to consider taking the key off of it or making it 1-groupable to bring more people into the zone <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0>.<br><div></div>

<P><EM>Of course however, like every old zone, the usability of the zone reduces substantially over the years. The original poster thinks that there's disconnect between us and the players, but in my opinion, the original poster really doesn't seem to see why this zone isn't used anymore - it's because realistically, things from Gates of Discord and before are rarely used because there's newer, better, more rewarding content in each and every expansion we put out. It's simply going to happen in a game that now has 11 expansions and is pushing an 8th year of being Live. You could replace this VP thread and say the same thing for the Solusek C, Cazic Thule, or Siren's Grotto revamps. Heck, you can probably say the same thing for zones that don't have the revamp, such as DawnshroudPeaks, Crypt of Decay, or Riwwi.</EM></P>
<P>Zajeer, are there any plans to revamp Everquest in general, so that all the old zones&nbsp;once again become an integral part of the EQ experience?&nbsp; The Devs have got to see that&nbsp;leveling to 75-80 and chasing after bigger gear is not welcomed by everyone.</P></DIV>

<P><BR>My understanding of the direction the devs are moving in, is that each new expansion will involve a revamp of at least a few old zones, as well, Like DoN and PoR did. In fact, I would suspect, from the info that has been released thus far, that the next expansion includes a LOT of old world revamps.</P>
<P>Since they mention a new starting city, but no new races, I'm guessing the froggies find a home, but in the process, unearth/find/discover a whole new expansion worth of zones.</P>

				<DIV>&nbsp; VP needs to stay right where it is now. It's challenging enough for the average 70, contains quests that impart elementalish-level gear, but more importantly, tend to&nbsp;have better non-HP stats/saves than your average rot/junk/instance from DoD/PoR, and the dragon encounters were designed cleverly and generally are not buggy. The incidental drops are pretty&nbsp;nice, and frankly, there's a lot of info still missing on New VP, just look at Alla's and see how much info has been added, and the space over the amount of time since the new dragons came out. We still are not exactly sure of everything that drops in that zone. Look at Phara'Dar's (incomplete)&nbsp;loot table. Hell, find me a decent and reliable strat for Xygoz, for that matter. Unresistable fear that even knights can't counter, that's a kick in the head. Especially with the 'improved pathing', improved in that feared people get unerringly sent right out of the zone. The people that I've done test runs on Xygoz with have a Dev Dartboard setup over that encounter.</DIV>

The rest of us will continue poking around enjoying ourselves.</DIV>

<P>Just to bring the conversation back to the subject. The update to VP was the last straw issue for me when I left EQ 2 years ago. Our little casual guild bothered to get keyed up for VP the hard way and was taking 1 or two groups in for fun. Placing a planes level raid requirement on the new key (which we failed at many times as a guild and as open raids) solely to protect mostly single group content was dumb and seemed directly aimed at denying single group xp content to people not in large raiding guilds. It also seemed to fly in the face of the old casual versus raider argument that "Ok you aint in a raiding guild so you cant do the most recent 3 expansions but with better equipment and levels you can potter around the older expansions" Thats what we were doing killing Trak and velious dragons etc mostly having fun on a server with not a significant population in our timezone. Then along comes a developer thinking, "Hrmm under used zone because the top raiders dont seem to be using" and "Ohhh anomally, a marginly better single group xp zone requiring 2 months of dumb camping and a old raid mob to get into". "Lets change it so only a raiding guild can come and kill what for&nbsp; them an easy mob, look about once in the zone and never return but more <STRONG>importantly lock</STRONG> it so the riff raff cant get in" Hell it wasnt as if we hadnt worked&nbsp;to get the old key.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>*shrug*, your misconceptions can remain your own. On Quellious, thanks to open raids conducted during the heyday of the VP questing, there were approximately 300 people flagged just on opens and tagalongs from guilds raiding Suled`Dar.&nbsp;&nbsp;My guesstimate based on who I've seen in there, I'd say&nbsp;10% of those were motivated people who have&nbsp; at various times tinkered with the dragons, doing some kills, running some alts around for loot, etc.&nbsp; The last time I set something up for VP was about 2 months ago, and we managed to get 21 in the zone, which is plenty for everything (except, it seems, Xygoz). Be that as it may. I'm enjoying the zone. My acquaintances are too. Sucks to be you I guess.<BR></DIV>
