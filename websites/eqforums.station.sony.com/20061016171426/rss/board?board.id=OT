      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;..and there were none when I began posting this, so there! :smileywink:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp; Friday went to the Haunted House around the corner, a benefit for autistic kids.&amp;nbsp; Got in free as a member of the media, and admittance into a VIP tent with horror movies playing and free Hors D'eovres.&amp;nbsp; Only a few showed up aside from me, a guy from a small local paper and someone from a local high school radio station. Someone had tracked in dog poop, so we had the pleasure of eating with the aromatic smell od poo in the air.We got press packs and glowy necklaces, woo hoo. We were led thru first...and although their hearts are in the right place, it kinda sucked as a haunted house.&amp;nbsp; Later watched the recorded season premiere of Ghosthunters....friggin' awesome!&amp;nbsp; The group I am in is doing an investigation in a few weeks, looking forward to that..private house with documented stuff happening!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Helped a friend assemble their home theater system Saturday and made it better than it was hooked up before. My friend wanted me to go to a wedding, I didn't want to go.&amp;nbsp; They ended up not going either, and took me and their kids out for all you can eat sushi instead.&amp;nbsp; Love it!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp; Sunday took part in a Vox nostalgia raid with GoTT, but we only had one group with 2 druids and no cleric. We figured we die but wnat the hell. Ended up getting knockback in a hallway that knocked everyone right into Vox's lair, so we poked Vox until we were slain (5 seconds or so)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;Went halloween shopping and played Mario Paper rpg rest of the day&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hello I am interested in upgrading my video card (curently a GeForce4 Ti 4600), but I'm not sure how to begin... What system specs do I need to look at to insure that the new card would be compatible with the rest of my system? What cards would you recomend? Any I should avoid?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Ok, so I bought a new headset for my notebook.  The one I had before was 2 3.5mm jacks, but the sound card on this computer is really faulty (there are tons of cases of the exact same problem), so I had to get a USB headset.  I plugged it in and it is working fine.  However, the computer is not.  The computer speakers should be off, as well as the built in mic....but...they aren't.  It's WEIRD.  They aren't playing back the NAS song that is blairing in the headset, but the computer speakers are 'playing' whatever the laptop mic (not the headset one) picks up.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that I think about it....I think this is because of a regedit that I made....this is a really pointless post.</description>

      <title>Balthitor: A Beginning of Sorts</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=OT&amp;message.id=162853#M162853</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Got the twitch to write a short story, so, that's what I'm gonna do. Been awhile since I've done something like this. I figure I'll write it with an open ending for later expansion, so if you can't bear to read a story without a clear ending, this won't be for you. Really not sure how good it will be, but I may as well try.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Balthitor: A Beginning of Sorts&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A medical chamber is quite the technological revolution most would say. Where it once took a healer's full attention to restore the flesh of a wounded person, a medical chamber could be set to do so with minimal attention, meaning one man could do the work of dozens in a properly outfitted medical building. The way it worked was really quite elementry, and had inventors round the world putting palm to forehead at not having come up with it first. Such is the way of things. The chamber itself resembled a simple shower, though this analogy could only be used in the cleaner socioties. The trolls for instance, had a rather tough time grasping the idea, and were rather perturbed when they found they lost their smell after using the chambers. However, unlike the showers used on a daily basis by the humans and elves of the world, the medical chamber routed it's plumbing through a large vat of pure healing mana. It would stand to reason then, that the water would take on a healing property. Any wound short of death could be healed by a stint in the medical chambers. Of course, it took some time. Even the Elves were not so frivolous as to use the medical chambers for healing minor wounds, and larger wounds, even with the aid of magic, took some time to heal.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This is why, when Balthitor awoke in a medical chamber his first thought was to wonder what the date was. He thought that curious for a moment, he had always imagined the first concious thought after days or even weeks in one of the chambers would be one of hunger. He mused that the magic of the water cascading over him bust have kept his hunger at bay. He then turned his mind to just why it was he was in a medical tank. Last he could recall, he was in the forest seeking out a wizard to study under. His magic had reached the limit of what those in the cities could teach, and the more powerful wizards always saw fit to sequester themselves in the most unusual of places. Perhaps it was these places where wizards felt most at one with the magic of the world. This was but one of the great many secrets he had hoped to learn.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Turning his mind back to the matter at hand, he imagined that since he could remember no confrontation, he must have been ambushed. He ran his hand over the back of his head and felt a large, but fading, bump. Had he not searched for it when he did it would have been healed away by the time he did. Well this was curious, why would someone ambush a young budding wizard in the middle of nowhere? Could have been muggers he thought breifly, before discarding the idea. There were hardly any muggers in those parts of the woods, and what few there were would have a hard time getting a jump on even the weakest of wizards. No, whoever had attacked him was trained and skilled in his chosen art.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Then there was the matter of being in a medical chamber, and not dead. Out in the middle of nowhere like that, it seemed unlikely that he would get medical attention so promptly, being that a wound to his head large enough to warrant a medical chamber treatment would most likely result in his death quite quickly. As if on cue, it was about this time that the medical building attendant noticed Balthitor stirring in his chamber. Balthitor stood shakely as the man approached.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"So, how's the head?" asked the attendant.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"Healing up quite well I suppose, though I don't remember the wound," stated Balthitor. He noted a grin on the mans face that was rather unsettling.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"No, I don't suppose you would," the man smirked. Balthitor grew even more uneasy as he looked about the medical building. He had been in the medical building of Arthitas, the closest city to where he had been prior to the attack, and this most certainly was not it. It was curious that he would be in any other medical building. That's when he noticed the emblem on the tapestry near the door, and a bit of horror began to make its way through his body.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"The captain would like to see you right away." the attendant said, seeming not to notice the frightened look on Balthitor's face. It was about the worst situation he could imagine. He was in a military stronghold. Normally it wouldn't be so much a problem, except that after 500 years of peace, King Groth had disbanded the military. The most battle thirsty of them had taken up residence in the military strongholds, and were now no&amp;nbsp;more than highly trained, and thus highly dangerous, thugs. Things were starting to add up. Balthitor realized he had so easily been ambushed because it was the most combat hardened, highly trained thugs in the world that had done the deed. Apparently they had wanted him alive, which explains how he so quickly recieved medical treatment.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"So then, I'm not so much a patient as I am a prisoner, is that right?" Balthitor asked of the attendant. That frightening grin crossed the mans face again.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"I suppose that wholey depends upon you. Your freedom to move about is directly proportional to the amount of cooperation you give the captain," the man explained.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;"Well then, I suppose we best not keep him waiting then," Balthitor gulped. "Can I at least have my clothing returned before my audience?"&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;To be continued....&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;..barely.&amp;nbsp; I work across the street from the mall EB is in, so I took my break a bit before 10 and headed over there. Got there five minutes til 10 and they were already open, with a line of 10 people in front of me. They only had around 12 they could presell, so I just squeaked by.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;Seems odd the amount would be so limited, you would think Nintendo would ship all they could to meet demand.&amp;nbsp; But there WILL be an online prebuy thru EB/Gamestop coming up.&amp;nbsp; Looking forward to Zelda, but REALLY more so tothe Mario game that should come out within a few months of release.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>I got yer Happy Cows right here!</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=OT&amp;message.id=162776#M162776</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;OK, I am, as many of you know, a Wisconsin boy from birth. I am a true Cheesehead. So naturally I am dismayed that the otherwise fine state of California recently surpassed Wisconsin in milk production and threatens to surpass us in cheese production within a few years. (But they will never surpass us in quality!!!!!)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anyway, I'm sure you've all seen the promotional adds from the California Dairy council talking about how "good cheese comes from happy cows and happy cows live in California" or some such drivel.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Well, if I am reading &lt;A href="http://www.commondreams.org/views06/1012-32.htm" target=_blank&gt;this article&lt;/A&gt; correctly, it's those "happy cows" that are responsible for the E. coli contamination in the spinach.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr **SMURF**"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;E. coli O157-H7 is a by-product of grain-based feeding to dairy and beef cattle in an attempt to fatten them up quicker at a lower cost. The cow's digestive system and acid balance is designed to break down grass, not high-production, refined rations that is the practice of large-scale, industrial agriculture. Irrigation water can also carry E. coli contamination; fields can be contaminated with raw sewage from flooding. This recent outbreak, and past deadly problems with contaminated meat, are a direct by-product of producing cheap, unhealthy cattle. &lt;/EM&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The agricultural area of California where this latest contamination crisis originated, produces 74 percent of the fresh-market spinach grown in the United States, and many other fresh-market vegetables. It is contiguous to many Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, managing thousands of dairy cows&lt;/EM&gt;. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P dir=ltr&gt;So I think I've come up with the perfect new slogan for the Wisconsin Dariy Board:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P dir=ltr&gt;"Wisconsin Cheese! Our cows won't crap on your spinach!"&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;So what's new with your reading?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I was on a reading spurt for awhile there and it has slacked off.&amp;nbsp; I am currently reading Wicked (the story of the wicked witch of the east) and enjoying it.&amp;nbsp; I started it on my way back from Arizona (in August) and it keeps nagging me to read more read more.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;On the way to Arizona I read the Bad Twin, the loosely connected to Lost book.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have a couple of Alex Delaware detective novels waiting.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And, I am so ashamed, I STILL haven't read my George RR Martin latest Clash of Kings book I bought at last Christmas.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;I'm not really sure what prompted me to make this one, but I like it so I thought I'd share. It's a small index of the main Symbiote characters in Spider-Man.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Edit: Later, I may decide to add in some of the less important (to the Symbiote story) characters, like Toxin.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Innocence-Lost on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;10-11-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;04:57 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <title>Looking for new monitors</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=OT&amp;message.id=162666#M162666</link>
      <description>Mom's looking to get me a new monitor for XMas to replace the CRT I have now. Which basically means I'll be picking it out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What I want to know, is what should I look for in LCD monitors? I want to go with a minimum 19", but I'm not positive on the rest of the details to look for. Price tag will likely be in the 500$ range Canadian. (and probably something available at Staples or Futureshop or similar big boxes)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My current monitor is a Viewsonic CRT and I've had excellent luck with that brand in general. What are similarly good brands to look for that are fairly common? What brands are good to avoid?</description>
