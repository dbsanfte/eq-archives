    <title>Movelog?</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=10609</link>
    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I have a question about the movelog. I searched and there were no recent posts on it so figured I'd start a new one.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Myself and a few friends that I am aware of still have not gotten moved from Zek. It's been well over a week since we did the movelog to Stromm.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Has anyone else who put in the movelog to Stromm AFTER they placed it back in the list of options been moved?&amp;nbsp;Apparently&amp;nbsp;Stromm was removed from the list, but people still got transferred that did a movelog before they removed it....then it was put back and that's when we all did out movelogs. To my knowledge I thought they were doing transfers nightly from 2-4 am? None of us has been logged into EQ anywhere near that time since the movelog. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So just curious if&amp;nbsp;we somehow got skipped or if&amp;nbsp;we should continue being patient :P&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>in this post&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=zek&amp;message.id=886&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kytherea offered, most generously, to help those who had submitted a movelog after 3/3 and had been waiting 3 or more days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Kytherea wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;If you requested the movelog BEFORE servers came up on Thursday, 3/3/2005, please disregard that request on the movelog and resubmit your request.  If you have made a request AFTER 3/3/2005 and it has been 3 days or more since you put in the request and you have a character or characters that have not moved yet, please send me a pm with your station name, character name and destination server.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She helped me, and I'm sure she'll help you too, if you're nice about it! :)</description>
