    <description>&lt;div&gt;Recently Ranked #1 Family style guild on The Seventh Hammer server, we welcome you to join us. After recently growing to 390+ members and adding 2 more leaders to the guild, we realize that sheer numbers do not make up a family, but it's the loyalty and the heart behind the Character that moves a family to greatness. We are recruiting all levels and races and you may contact an officer or leader listed below to contact one of us ingame. There is always someone online. Our guild was founded in September 2004 and continues to thrive and grow and prove its worth in every situation. We have helped get guildies, epics, both 1.0 and 1.5 in and out of our alliance, just for the sake of fun. We have leveled several family members to planes status and beyond, hosted many great and wonderful event, and even had a few weddings. One of slogans is &amp;quot;no politics, just fun&amp;quot; and that's what a game should be about. You have politics in your every day life, why put up with it in your free relaxing family time...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So jump on in and give us a yell!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Leader = Blaknight&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Leader = Vishnos&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Leader Whispand&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Officer = Kazeul&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Officer = Dactyl&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Officer Leapinglizerd&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Officer = Graystone&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Officer Xyrexx&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Officer = Tinerdarye&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Or come by our website at &lt;a href="http://mystical-illusions.guildportal.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://mystical-illusions.guildportal.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And &amp;quot;WELCOME HOME&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>
