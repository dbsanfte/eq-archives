      <title>Tradeskill Tests new requirement?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Trade&amp;message.id=12174#M12174</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;  Just need to know if they have made PoR expansion a new requirement to be able to do the tradeskill tests. The reason I ask is that I completed the research and baking tests and now am unable to get any of the other tests. IF Sony has made it  a new requirement (like withholding the extra bank space for non PoR owners -_-) **SMURF** was the point of allowing me to do the first 2? Was it just oversight/idiocy on their part? I just recently bought the Titanium expansion pack so I now have all BUT PoR. Any insight would be appreciated.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Hmm suddenly I get the feeling I have a carrot dangling over my head. -_- Man I love greedy companies. See the new zones or mobs should be part of a new expansion BUT to screw people over on very basic game items (who couldn't use more bank space?) really irritates me. THANKS ALOT SOE!&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Yes, PoR is now required to do the trophy quests.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It was always meant to be that way. Allowing people to do them who didn't have PoR was an oversight that was fixed. &lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;So it was NOT an oversight.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It was NOT the intent to "tease" by allowing it for a while.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The short answer is 'no.' The subscriptions likely cover basic operating expenses plus a profit margin. New content is almost certainly a separate budget with a separate business plan.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I do sort of wonder what budget bug fixes come under though... &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The NPC was put in one of the zones updated for PoR, in a location easily accessible for people running back and forth to PoK.  I'm sure a lot of us doing these task would have preferred the NPC to actually be located in PoK for our own convenience, but we're not complaining.  It was sound business decision on SOEs part and the location fits in with the new expansion.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;The tradeskill trophy NPCs are in West Freeport because low levelled players do tradeskills too, and the PoR zones are not safe for anyone lower than ~level 45 or so....even the Arcstone portal area isn't safe since mobs can easily be trained there.&amp;nbsp; Besides, it's happened before...the shroud NPCs are in PoK, not DoDh zones, yet you can't use shrouds unless you have the expansion.&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

In case of the tradeskill quests, there is a lot of old code surrounding quests and lots of potential interdependancy issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a risk perspective it would have been very much easier to put NPC's somewhere else. This could have involved a safe zone -in area in the new expansion/safe port in location etc. Ease of access is one consideration while developing quests like this, but a few zones more or less for so powerfull an item shouldn't be a huge issue either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, i guess this made a lot of non POR buyers happy, unless SOe decides to retro take away these items as non intended rewards/exploits/bugfixes. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I specifically Chose west freeport because.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;#1 As mentioned, there are not really any safe areas in the expansion zones.&amp;nbsp; Even if seemingly safe, there are still "train" problems.&amp;nbsp; In Freeport you ate least have the opportunity to get faction to the point where you can mostly ignore trains.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;#2 it did not make sense to me to have them in those zones, at least not story wise.&amp;nbsp; Though I probably could have twisted something around for it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;#3 Freeport was being revamped.&amp;nbsp; I wanted something to bring people there.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;#4 They were adding faction quests to easily get to at least dubious in freeport, and with not too much work, friendly enough to buy.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;#5 I did not want to add yet MORE NPC's to Plane of Knowledge.&amp;nbsp; It is already crowded there.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;#6 when I made the decision, and added the NPC and had already implemented the 1300 database entries required for the tasks, and the 400 or so lines of script necessary to work with trophies, being a new designer... I did not even think about the Expansion only requirement.&amp;nbsp; As I have said before... I agree at the same time as disagree with the decision to restrict this to Expansion only.&amp;nbsp; I decided It was fine where it was.&amp;nbsp; Plus it would have taken alot of work to then move the NPC's.&amp;nbsp; Call me lazy if you want, but I was also under heavy time constraints and had alot of other work to do.&amp;nbsp; I made the decision that it would have the same problem in PoK, and as #1 says, there was no good place to put it in the expansion zones for lower level characters.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So while the decision to make it expansion only was not mine, I do not want you thinking the choice of the placement was anything but my decision, and that I did consider moving them, but decided against it.&amp;nbsp; I also want to be clear that I agree with the decision to make it expansion only, even if I may not like it.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes a choice has to be made whether I like it or not :) We need to make money on the expansions, and we need to put in it things that players want, or we will not get money from the expansion.&amp;nbsp; With that in mind, we cannot just freely give it out then, if we want to make money from it.&amp;nbsp; Again there is that fact that we are a business.&amp;nbsp; I love tradeskills, but I definitely want to be paid for doing this job, I am not quite so magnanimous as to do this much work for free :)&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Dev-Ngreth on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;03-29-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;10:18 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Dev-Ngreth wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I specifically Chose west freeport because.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;#1 As mentioned, there are not really any safe areas in the expansion zones.  Even if seemingly safe, there are still &amp;quot;train&amp;quot; problems.  In Freeport you ate least have the opportunity to get faction to the point where you can mostly ignore trains.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;#2 it did not make sense to me to have them in those zones, at least not story wise.  Though I probably could have twisted something around for it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;#3 Freeport was being revamped.  I wanted something to bring people there.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;#4 They were adding faction quests to easily get to at least dubious in freeport, and with not too much work, friendly enough to buy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;#5 I did not want to add yet MORE NPC's to Plane of Knowledge.  It is already crowded there.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;#6 when I made the decision, and added the NPC and had already implemented the 1300 database entries required for the tasks, and the 400 or so lines of script necessary to work with trophies, being a new designer... I did not even think about the Expansion only requirement.  As I have said before... I agree at the same time as disagree with the decision to restrict this to Expansion only.  I decided It was fine where it was.  Plus it would have taken alot of work to then move the NPC's.  Call me lazy if you want, but I was also under heavy time constraints and had alot of other work to do.  I made the decision that it would have the same problem in PoK, and as #1 says, there was no good place to put it in the expansion zones for lower level characters.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So while the decision to make it expansion only was not mine, I do not want you thinking the choice of the placement was anything but my decision, and that I did consider moving them, but decided against it.  I also want to be clear that I agree with the decision to make it expansion only, even if I may not like it.  Sometimes a choice has to be made whether I like it or not :) We need to make money on the expansions, and we need to put in it things that players want, or we will not get money from the expansion.  With that in mind, we cannot just freely give it out then, if we want to make money from it.  Again there is that fact that we are a business.  I love tradeskills, but I definitely want to be paid for doing this job, I am not quite so magnanimous as to do this much work for free :)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Dev-Ngreth on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;03-29-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;10:18 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Na. It is nothing about lazy nor about your decisions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More about the vision and thoughts that should have gone into stuff like that on the producer side of eq.  In operations there is only so much you can think of yourself, thats why the producer has to work the thoughttrains thru to the end and decide on that. Once the decision was in place- who-ever made it, it gets harder each day to go back on that one. Once you have that much code added, it is basicly too late&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If this had been thought of at the very start, it would have been easy to design a safespot in the expansion, not accessible to the non por enabled people.  As is, it made quite a few happy so in the end it works out anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, is it the intention that tradeskill trophees can not outlevel their owners? If so, there is a bug somewhere- seeing i have a master fletching trophee but 298 skill&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Like Aphreal42 mentioned...&amp;nbsp; Yes.&amp;nbsp; It can get one "step" ahead of you then it stops until you catch up.&amp;nbsp; This was intentional.&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Dev-Ngreth on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;03-30-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;09:12 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Your trophy can outlevel you by one step, like you desribed. It will then quit gaining exp for your combines until you catch up to it. So it can't outlevel you too far, but it can end up ahead of you temporarily.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Well I for one am KoS to freeport guards and stuff and it easyer for me to run back to PoK so there is one reason to run back and forth.  Also, I have like zero room so I made 1-3 items on each quest and then went and turned them in and then ran back to PoK/Abysmal sea to work on the rest.  So there are a few reason to run back and forth.  I also would have hate to run to some random PoR zone to do my hand ins I think the location pick is perfected.</description>

      <description>&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Wyora wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The NPC was put in one of the zones updated for PoR, in a location easily accessible for people running back and forth to PoK.  I'm sure a lot of us doing these task would have preferred the NPC to actually be located in PoK for our own convenience, but we're not complaining.  It was sound business decision on SOEs part and the location fits in with the new expansion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why do you have to keep goign to PoK? The Venders in Freeport were updated to have everything that Abysmal Sea had, so most, if not everything, you would need should be in the Freeport area. Or are there things in PoK not in Abysmal/Freeport? Oh wait, are you KoS in Freeport and that's why?</description>
