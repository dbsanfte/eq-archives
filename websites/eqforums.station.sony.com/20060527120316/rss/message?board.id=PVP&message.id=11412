    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;As can see from the previous post many things were promised and not implemented for some reason or another.&amp;nbsp; instead of fixxing some they just removed them completely.&amp;nbsp; That 50% melee hitbox is a joke.&amp;nbsp; Imagine getting hit from someone 10 steps behind you while trying to get room to get a spell off that takes 4-5 seconds to cast.&amp;nbsp; Dispell was never adressed other than AHR bracer which they just changed to not work in pvp at all.&amp;nbsp; PvP gear has remained the same as when points first came out and soon pvp points became totaly meaningless.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Also, a new change that was put into play recently, looting all your corpse with out it being rezed causes the corpse to remain.&amp;nbsp; That corpse used to be looted after a PvP death making it so the dead player had to run back.&amp;nbsp; Now the corpses cant be looted and the corpse remains.&amp;nbsp; With people going to shadow rest with gear on all it takes is a rez for them to be back fighting again.&amp;nbsp; They are rezed back in fully dressed and if a druid or shaman rezes then fully buffed as well.&amp;nbsp; That is bull.&amp;nbsp; They should have to sit out for the rez effects to wear off.&amp;nbsp; A melee freshly rezed doesnt even have to wait to (med) they can engage in the fight immedatly.&amp;nbsp; There should be no corpse if you are PKed.&amp;nbsp; Or it should be able to be looted again.&amp;nbsp; They dont lose experience for them to worry about.&amp;nbsp; The penalty is only that they have to wait for the PvP death effects to wear off.&amp;nbsp; The last few guild battles noone won becuase everyone was just getting rezed in the second they died, healed conviction tossed on them and haste.&amp;nbsp; Then they were ready to go again.&amp;nbsp; Total time out of the fight is maybe 2 minutes.&amp;nbsp; You should not have to kill the same person 3-4 times in a 20 minute time span.&amp;nbsp; There needs to be stricter consquences for a pvp death then losing some points that dont matter, your buffs, and 2 minutes of zoning.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Fix PvP</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=PVP&amp;message.id=11404#M11404</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I do not know where to post this and if someone does and can either link this thread or copy this to the correct place I would be greatful.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To start off with, I am the second best geared necromancer on Zek.&amp;nbsp; I have played on sullon zek and then zek for the last 5 years.&amp;nbsp; In the past the developers have felt the need to change melee damage, hit rate, spell damage, max spell damage and resists.&amp;nbsp; Some of these were needed and helped PvP for that time in the progression of guilds.&amp;nbsp; It is now time to relook and change these again.&amp;nbsp; When melee damage was upgraded it was for weapons that had a max damage of 45.&amp;nbsp; Now there are tons of people running around with 90+ damage weapons.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;On my necromancer i am 9500 hps unbuffed, have all defensive aas, 100 avoidance, max stun resists, dodge 3, and high AC for a caster of 1500ish.&amp;nbsp; Yet in PvP I am chain stunned by any melee class who can hit for 1,000 to 4,500.&amp;nbsp; Melee range was modified so that can hot from much further away as well.&amp;nbsp; Now as a dps class I have 1 spell that lands and it lands maybe 2 out of 5 times.&amp;nbsp; That is our ancient tap spell from OoW era.&amp;nbsp; When it does land it crits for an amazing amount of 30.&amp;nbsp; That is correct 300 damage and if im lucky i can get a crit heal on top for 600 heal to myself.&amp;nbsp; Now I know what you are thinking I am a necromancer and should do DoTs as well, but none land.&amp;nbsp; If you are lucky you can get a level 65 heal over time leech called Night's Beacon to land, but that is dispellable and does 200 damage per tick to people who have dot shielding and 13000 hps.&amp;nbsp; So there we have a dps class who cant do any dps in PvP.&amp;nbsp; I am getting tired of it.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My guild 6 months ago had 12 active necromancers.&amp;nbsp; Now all but 2 have quit due to our class being broken in pvp.&amp;nbsp; In a recent Guild&amp;nbsp; vrse Guild pvp battle the most killed class was necromancer.&amp;nbsp; One necro from my guild and one in the other were killed about 8 times each in 4 hours.&amp;nbsp; The most any other class had was 2 deaths.&amp;nbsp; The combined necromancer kills were 5.&amp;nbsp; One melee alone had 22.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Necromancers are not a healing class, we are not a support class, we are not a defensive class, we are a DAMAGING class.&amp;nbsp; Yet we have no ability to do any.&amp;nbsp; We are sitting ducks.&amp;nbsp; Other casters classes are in the same boat as necromancers, but I cant comment on them as I have no first hand knowledge.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I know sony does not care about the only PvP server, but they need to take some time and balance pvp again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Here are some things that need to be changed:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Make other spells other than magic ones pvp options for necromancers.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Have melee who hit for 4,500 be able to get hit for the same amount.&amp;nbsp; It is not fair for a class like a warrior to 1 round someone when our spells are limited to 40% of thier hps.&amp;nbsp; That should only be for the spells it was intended for: Manaburn, lifeburn, and HT.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Change Melee stuns so they no longer are irresistable.&amp;nbsp; Any monk with a Tstaff even in bazaar gear can keep any other&amp;nbsp;class chain stunned.&amp;nbsp; In a monk duel i watched this week the first one to click 2.0 was the winner becuase the other was just stunned for the rest of the fight.&amp;nbsp; The whole fight lasted 20 seconds.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Potions should be removed on Zek.&amp;nbsp; I will spend almost all my mana fighting someone only to have all the damage i just did healed by 1 potion.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Melee damage needs to be reduced for pvp.&amp;nbsp; for example a sk can hit for 1500 , rogues can backstab from any angle for 3000 and get tripples if behind, warriors can hit for 4,500, zerkers hit for 4,000, monks hit for 2,000, pallys fir 2,000, rangers can hot for 1000 with a one hander and more with thier bow and the new DohD spell HoA, and bards hit for 750 with one handers.&amp;nbsp; Everyone should see how fast a 9500 caster lasts while taking 2000 average per swing hits.&amp;nbsp; I have been 1 rounded fully raid buffed.&amp;nbsp; Fix it so casters have some chance against this.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Pet hits need to be upgraded.&amp;nbsp; They were lowered, but that needs to be relooked at.&amp;nbsp; With my anguish focus my pet hits in pvp for 12 per hit.&amp;nbsp; Only thing he is useful for is maybe a stun, but AAs have stopped that now.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I know this whole post seems like I am crying becuase I have been killed a lot, but that is not it.&amp;nbsp; I just want to have a competitive chance.&amp;nbsp; If others have any other good suggestions on how to fix pvp please list them below.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Hangman Gallows&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;70 Necromancer&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Officer of Hate&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Just an update.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last week I got backstabed for 6500 against a **SMURF** geared rogue with a nice dagger.  It was a nice crit.  I didnt have time to even get a tap off before I died.  I cant even cast a 2.3 second spell before getting killed and im 13,999 hps raid buffed.  SONY SUCKS GET OFF YOUR ASSES AND FIX THIS **SMURF**.  EARN THE FEE WE PAY YOU.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>and spells still dont land at all.  With the new expansion and tons of resist gear why even bother having casters available as a pvp option?   They are so useless in pvp now that no one picks them to play.  Just take them all off zek and make it a melee only server.&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>You have to remember that when you compare two classes, they need to be at the same gear level. Because if they are not at the same gear level, it is like comparing apples to oranges. Although I do agree that most if not all spells need to land a lot more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  Well Mr. Zach I can only wish I could land a life tap as easy as you think we can.Man a 500 resist check would sure own wouldnt it Hangman?To bad its only 200 and I get resisted often, and when I dont ,I rarely hit for more than 900 without a crit.My dots are great against someone in Benediction or NSA lol.BTW while im in the middle of casting, your running behind me strapping it on and giving it to be from behind for a 2-3k BS.Our only way to stay alive is to tap a low lvl mob we hope is around.Also if we get snared or stunned which happens often now its pretty much over or were running for our life.Now Im not saying your not under powered because I beleive you are in PvP!!! If there is any kinda stun it should only be a split second to interupt a casters spell not 10 times on the merry-go-round like it is now.So  do away with heal pots,long stuns,snares all together,and lower damage on rangers bow.So how about for a rogue ,you get a quick  poison with a 1 second casting/ apply time with it being unresitable, to interupt casting time only?Last, fix the resist checks for casters plz theres just to many hp to kill with our spell being worthless.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of hp ac and mitagation high end casters have now is crazy. Hell some of my guilds casters run around with 14k hp thats alot for most mellee to eat through not to mention runes and other things.So imo mellee is pretty well balanced due to this (besides monks and maybe zerkers)The one thing though is casters need there defensive spells to land, root snares darkness etc if these would land then it be a much more balanced game. Not only more balanced but much more fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So anyway if I were a dev I guess id look into resist more then anything in pvp. basically pvp has degraded into atatckign and healing and little else. Not close to as fun as it was in the old days when spells actually landed as intended.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;yes, YOUR guild is, and your guild is by no means a representative of the server as a whole. Infact, most casters are running around with 6-8K HP self buffed.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;So after years of Necros being PvP gods, Sony finally fixes things so other classes have a chance against necros and you are now crying foul? You didn't complain about your classes abilities in PvP when the servers were dominated by necro/sk. How do you think the players of the other classes felt going up against you before necros were nerfed? Maybe Sony did get a little carried away with INT casters, but isn't like your particular was weak to begin with. Imagine how the Enchanters must feel. Their best line, their mind control stuff, never worked at all in PvP. Any offensive spells they had that were capable of doing damage were negated by super high resists. Even using the Tash line didn't help. Now INT casters in general get nerfed, so where does that leave enchanters?</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sony finally fixes things so other classes have a chance against necros and you are now crying foul?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, have a chance = totally dominate and yes I am crying foul.  I almost have 10k hps as a necro and am one of the top AC necros with every defenseive AA.  I get hit for 4500 by warriors and even when they dont hit me that hard it is around 500-1000 every hit.  I also have a 70 enchanter with 7k hps and it is the same way.   I own a 9k hp 70 rogue as well with only the first few AAs into Defensive and he takes a crap load less damage i'd say as little as 1/4 damage.  He can bacstab from the front for 1-2k most times and 3k about 1 out of 10 times.  My necro lands a spell 1 out of 4 times for about 400 damage.  That is just rediculous.  Every necro from every guild on Zek is rerolling. Ulaquay now is a monk, 2 from my guild went to ranger, 1 went to zerker, 1 went monk, I dont know about AD or Defiant, but im sure its the same way.  No, necros are not pvp gods and havent been for over a year.  Necros suck and so do all casters in pvp.  If you are a bazaar geared person then you have no idea what im talking about.  But every high end necro who fights againts people in the same gear level as they are unfortunately do understand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The problem of necros is this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While they gear up and get better spells, their potential against evenly geared top end characters gets less and less. Anyone who knows how dispell himself can get rid of their DoTs if they land at all. Lifetaps get resisted also quite often. Their epic pets can be kited until they despawn, and then they are just a caster trying to stay away from melee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If people don't dispell Dots and have few resists, yes, necros are powerful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>All you people saying PvP shouldnt effect PvE in anyway are irritating. All you people on blue servers need to get off the pvp forum. They dont have to make Zek changes happen on every server. Could be different like Firiona or something. But they dont take the time to do 1 tiny thing different on Zek server than they do blue servers.  They could of fixed looting augged gear by simply making it to where when you loot the augged item the aug goes directly back on corpse and you get the item. Now a days PvP is just almost pointless. I still like to PvP on my 60 SK but 70 PvP is dumb cause of melees slaughtering my Time geared druid in less than 10 seconds. I know Time isnt that great anymore but i shouldnt die as fast as a naked person in PvP with it. Also PvP points are only useful to people below 65 mostly or the few pet class's that may not have Minion of Eternity so they get the Minion of Darkness gloves. So many things wrong with PvP but so many easy fix's that they just wont do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;yeah I play an enchanter, with a little over 5K unbuffed HP I get beat down the most in PvP. The only threat I pose is dispell (easily countered with clickies) as people can crim pot faster than I can remove it for rapture. I'm lucky if i can land a 700 point nuke on someone in PvP. I&amp;nbsp;boxed a 14K unbuffed warrior, who, completely buffless and tashed, ran me out of mana before I could kill him.</description>

      <description>As for the bodies for rezzing... I think its a great idea... As it stands now people will kill some peeps in a raid and loot their bodies thereby inconvenienceing not only them but the entire raid. Only griefers would like for bodies to poof on death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for the whole bit about the necro stuff... Well necros had been top dog from Old World all the way up to like OOW and DON so my advice is to bend over and grab your ankles for a lil while it only hurts for a few expansions then you dont even notice you suck so much anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ofcourse all PVP 'fixes' seem to be demanded by the top 1% of the server. What about the non-ubers who dont have 600 to all resists and 2000 AA points... Everytime they change something for the top 1% the other 99% of the server gets screwed. Resists changes anyone? Remember when 100-150 in a resist was enough to protect you from getting snared/rooted/blinded/mezzed... sure it wouldnt protect ya from DDs or DOTs as much. If stuff wasnt changed then all this dot shielding and crap and other mudflation wouldnt have been needed but hey when the top 1% of the server complains everyone is getting too close to them then something gets done.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I would also have to agree about the pvp aspects of eq. it is annoying and unfair that a melee hits for normal PVE damage but still hits normal damage in PVP. making spells do full damage would not matter since you cant land crap on even someone with bad resists, so my guess would be to make a system perhaps an instanced pvp zone where when you zone in everything you do would be considered like PVE, reason it being instanced is&amp;nbsp;maybe it would be to hard to do that to the current arena type zones??....&amp;nbsp;i play both a caster and melee and i dont see how classes like rangers / bsts etc with 0.5 second nukes can land them on someone when i cant land my best fire or poisen dot on someone with the same resists and my dots have a resist check, that dont make sense.&amp;nbsp; and the ranger snare landing on bard with max resists at 600&amp;nbsp; dont make sense either, grantid ranger new don snare has a chromatic check to it, it is still checking against 600's across the board and lands... and for some reason it seems they nerf caster avoidance or something because with having max avoidance aa's avoidance 100 and improved dodge 2 you should avoid quite a bit of stuff, do you?? no you dont, you seem to still get hit alot aside from skeletons in everfrost.&amp;nbsp; imo thats to many aa's to spend to still be hit just about the same. PVP should be fixed on all servers because it is not even close to being balanced and i as well as many others (i would think) feel PVP is a big part of eq. so my thought is: if melee hit for normal damage, make casters hit for normal damage, if a melee with max avoidance aa's get missed alot make the caster get missed alot also, the thing would come down to AC and mitigation wich casters dont get hardly any AC with is understandable since we wear silk.&amp;nbsp; and i believe anything and everything casted towards another player character should have a chance to get resisted even the monk nukes they get. i have dueled a lower lvl person and debuffed them so theyre fire resist was at about 80 or 90 and my best fire dot has a resist check of 100, so if i am correct ( please correct me if im not) that should check his resist to a bare minimum of -10 and land, BUT i had to cast it 5 times to land it, now the spell costs 1092 mana a cast not including focus and specialization, thats alot of mana to use in pvp to have it be resisted so much. treat classes equally imo and eq would be a happy place. but if they did that then people would complain how a necro landed 4 dots on em and they died in 1-2 ticks so there goes another complaint and nerf bat starts swinging. make it equal and leave it alone. if dots land dont duel a necro, if a warrior 2 rounds you dont duel a warrior. simple. let me get ahold of pvp and certain aspects of eq ill fix em np, its hard to explain sometimes exactly what you mean.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

It just happens to be the 4 casting classes at this time.   In fact pure melee classes (war/mnk/rog) were historically everyone else's **SMURF** and they were a "DAMAGING" class.   I know this doesn't help you much but I think it's unreasonable to expect "balance" in pvp.  It was never there to begin with and the tides have simply changed recently.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;As can see from the previous post many things were promised and not implemented for some reason or another.&amp;nbsp; instead of fixxing some they just removed them completely.&amp;nbsp; That 50% melee hitbox is a joke.&amp;nbsp; Imagine getting hit from someone 10 steps behind you while trying to get room to get a spell off that takes 4-5 seconds to cast.&amp;nbsp; Dispell was never adressed other than AHR bracer which they just changed to not work in pvp at all.&amp;nbsp; PvP gear has remained the same as when points first came out and soon pvp points became totaly meaningless.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Also, a new change that was put into play recently, looting all your corpse with out it being rezed causes the corpse to remain.&amp;nbsp; That corpse used to be looted after a PvP death making it so the dead player had to run back.&amp;nbsp; Now the corpses cant be looted and the corpse remains.&amp;nbsp; With people going to shadow rest with gear on all it takes is a rez for them to be back fighting again.&amp;nbsp; They are rezed back in fully dressed and if a druid or shaman rezes then fully buffed as well.&amp;nbsp; That is bull.&amp;nbsp; They should have to sit out for the rez effects to wear off.&amp;nbsp; A melee freshly rezed doesnt even have to wait to (med) they can engage in the fight immedatly.&amp;nbsp; There should be no corpse if you are PKed.&amp;nbsp; Or it should be able to be looted again.&amp;nbsp; They dont lose experience for them to worry about.&amp;nbsp; The penalty is only that they have to wait for the PvP death effects to wear off.&amp;nbsp; The last few guild battles noone won becuase everyone was just getting rezed in the second they died, healed conviction tossed on them and haste.&amp;nbsp; Then they were ready to go again.&amp;nbsp; Total time out of the fight is maybe 2 minutes.&amp;nbsp; You should not have to kill the same person 3-4 times in a 20 minute time span.&amp;nbsp; There needs to be stricter consquences for a pvp death then losing some points that dont matter, your buffs, and 2 minutes of zoning.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;This is a copy and paste from when the PvP changes were made last time.&amp;nbsp; At that time this did fix PvP.&amp;nbsp; Then OoW came out and guilds got Tacvi and Anguish gear.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;[Quote]&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Taken from Hateguild.net...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thanks to the guildleaders from Hate, the most powerful guild on Sullon Zek, we may be seeing some changes for the better in terms of making pvp less of a joke...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;Basically, if you want to know a step by step of everything that happened while there, read this: &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#adae94&gt;http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showth...?threadid=21804&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;While there I was able to corner Rytan, the Developer in charge of the upcoming PvP changes, for more than 4 hours over the two days we were there. To say we had access to the people we wanted would be a joke. We had unlimited access to everything at SOE, including the personel. The devs hung out with us everywhere we went, including getting drunk with us at the hotel bar until 4am the first night, prior to the events even begining. I even got to sit next to Jamlamin to see the new petition system(it's nice irl) implemented in the last two weeks. At noon on Saturday, the number one complaint was about Termi and Attis warping and double DTing people. It was pretty lol~ &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;While at the GM booth, I saw the on wall projection of petition counts, population numbers, etc. We had half the population of any other server on the wall, or less. Brenlo said that was nothing new, and it had always been that way. I got Brenlo's personal assurance that he'd try to find a way to open movelogs to/from Sullon Zek, however it's quite a daunting task due to religions not being able to be changed without overhauling the entire character file, which takes about 4 man hours. We were even shown in depth how that would work, and why it was challenging. Personally, I don't see why they can't make an automated system to do the manual things, however it would take time invested into a project to do this. We'll see if it ever materializes. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the time spent with Rytan, Bakda and myself learned tons about the upcoming PvP changes. We were also able to give him ideas that will be implemented with the changes. Many of these came directly from the feedback we got on the threads I posted on guild boards. &lt;BR&gt;1) The water bug is gone as of now on the Test server. &lt;BR&gt;2) Zoning and gaining hitpoints equal to your gear is gone on Test server. &lt;BR&gt;3) Rogues will most likely get a structured AA for damage shield mitigation. &lt;BR&gt;4) Backstab will be mitigated less in PvP, raising the damage done by item on average. (This seemed promising, but he said it needed more testing) &lt;BR&gt;5) A PvP points system is already programmed and coming 100%. The items are already in the system as to what you can buy. When the PvP test server goes live, this will be tested as well. &lt;BR&gt;6) I mentioned 10 dose crimson potions and invis potions, and he thought they were both good ideas and possibly could be implemented outside of this point system as well. &lt;BR&gt;7) Due to Stormhammer being such a success (and cash cow) we never were able to make headway into this subject. However, I did get my point across that the service completely breaks servers that are not able to transfer characters to other servers otherwise. &lt;BR&gt;We were never able to talk about class balance at all. We were fortunate enough to talk about rogue damage shield mitigation. He's aware that bards are grossly overpowered, and is already working on a fix to capping bard spells such as mana sieve. PvP balance will be tested thoroughly when the test server goes live, and I reccomend strongly you all help with it if you want your say. &lt;BR&gt;9) The concept of PvE level limitsbeing enforced on PvP spells kind of got brushed aside as needing more evaluation, so those of you swinging on the nuts of rapture are safe for a bit longer. &lt;BR&gt;10) Dispells may or may not become resistable, depending on testing. He thought it was an interesting concept and a way to make some classes better at dispelling than others, as it should be. However, dispells in PvP WILL be changed to dispell random slots instead of the top slots always. This will be a major change, and a fair one, in PVP. Instant clicks will still help, but they won't break dispell completely. &lt;BR&gt;11) We are getting more buff slots for us and mobs. The idea was loved by all. &lt;BR&gt;12) Horse fixes will go live as they are proposed on EQlive forums. Stuns will knock you off horses. Snares will snare both the horse and you. Horses will remain unkillable. &lt;BR&gt;13) Plane of War: Battle Zone Extraordinaire was a concept loved by everyone at the event from the ubers to the casul players. Basically, I'd look for an instancable zone to be added with an expansion in the future that allows for a NON PVP, non instanced set up spot with entrances into PvP events (ala PoJ trials) such as 3 vs 3, 1 vs 1, 6 vs 6, 18 vs, 18, 54 vs 54, king of the hill, capture the flag, etc. The bonus to this is since instanced zones are done on a server farm with all other instanced zones, we will have the ability to fight people from other servers as well. Samdaman vs Furor anyone? &lt;BR&gt;14) They didn't really give a **SMURF** about training. I explained to them that it's always been used as a way for teams to control each other prior to instanced zones. Withinstanced zones training is broken giving people with instanced zones an advantage over others. I explained that at present Goods and Newts don't like training, and evils use it as a means of perpetual dominance. They still didn't really care, as it's always been that way. The only way training would go away on Sullon Zek, in their opinion, was with a ruleset change. We'd also lose all of our hardcore aspect in the change and the PnP would be enforced. &lt;BR&gt;15) I was amazed at how open they were with me on hacking. I completely derailed a 1 hour GM 20 person session talking about hacking for 20 to 30 minutes of it. Hacking will never be completely fixed. SEQ and other passive forms of hacking that do not change in game functions will never be fixed. Other hacks, such as megawarp, /gate, /zone, Feign dead hack etc will be addressed as they can. As long as people don't do something with hacks that is physically impossible for their characters to do, and/or Gms don't witness it first hand, then they won't get busted for it. &lt;BR&gt;16) Melees wil be getting PvP only abilities, and they may add spells with more PvP intent, or PvP only. &lt;BR&gt;17) AHR bracer will be nerfed to increase cast time. Other PvP imbalancing items such as the alliance necklace will also be looked at. &lt;BR&gt;1 Snares, Roots, Blinds, and other similarly crippling spells will now have a new field in Lucy for PvP resists and PvP duration. Snares will not last 14 minutes when they land, instead they will land MUCH more frequently and last small durations of time. I was told someone with high MR could expect to have snare last 12 to 18 seconds, which should help greatly in combating training. &lt;BR&gt;19) Merging the Good and Neutral teams will never happen. The population numbers are currently NOT skewed. In reality I got to see a great breakdown of it, and they are closer now than they ever have been in sheer numbers. The major difference is in gear and average AA points/levels. Merging goods and newts will just cause an unfair imbalance another way, and breaks the original premise of the server. &lt;BR&gt;20) I proposed that DA type spells be able to be dispelled in PvP. They didn't know if it was such a great idea, and said they'd be willing to test it on PvP test servers. &lt;BR&gt;21) PvP resists are getting a MAJOR overhaul. Expect every spell to have a PvP resist and a PVE resist. They will each be tuned for PvP. Spells with Multiple resist checks will also be tuned in the same way. &lt;BR&gt;22) Plane of Tranquility will 100% become a PvP zone. Plane of Knowledge and Nexus are up for debate still. Bazaar will not become a PvP zone for obvious reasons. &lt;BR&gt;23) The ranger unNerf of archery to 80% damage will most likely go through to live servers, but will be tested on the PvP test server first. Also, rangers are already fixed on test such that they cannot shoot through walls or trees anymore. &lt;BR&gt;24) Unfortunately, I didn't have time to get to Gate spells being unbalanced in PVP. I will be forwarding more information to Rytan about this. It's my opinion that Gate spells should not be allowed to be modified by spell haste effects on items or spells, justlike complete heal. 3.0 second gates are overpowered. &lt;BR&gt;25) Didn't get to Illusions in PvP. Coding for this would take quite some effort, and we are a long way off from getting more important **SMURF** straight to have to worry about this one. &lt;BR&gt;26) Pets will most likely be getting a resist system similar to their owner's or a portion thereof in PvP. Also, pets and push are being looked into. Pets may not be able to push mobs at all soon, getting rid of the pushing through walls issue being uncontrollable. &lt;BR&gt;27) The hitbox increase was seen as a good thing at the summit and willl be going live once test on the test server. However, don't necessarily expect it to go live as a 50% increase. I'd imagine it will be tested and end up in the 20 to 30% range. &lt;BR&gt;2 Didn't get to discuss bards gating mobs. This would require a good bit of effort to fix, but I will be forwarding it to Rytan also. We'll just live with this one for now. &lt;BR&gt;29) PoK stones, the ones on theother end of them, and LDoN Magus will all have a 10 second cast time with small radius. When you click or hail them, they will begin casting. If you run out of range of them, they will stop and interrupt. &lt;BR&gt;30) Rez boxes and TL boxes will have a component added to them such that if you move more than a little bit with them up, they poof. This should severely limit the ability to rez box and TL box train. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For all of you who thought I was going to go to the conference to suit Hate's needs and not represetn the server, **SMURF** off. I was far more agressive than 98% of the people present in getting our issues addressed. I spent as much time monopolizing the discussions as I could. I tried to preeesent everything in an unbiased or multi vieewpoint manner as I could. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For everyone who believed we have a pocket GM, now you have proof! Not only do we have a pocket GM, but we have a pocket Dev now too. Unfortunately, he is avilable to everyone in #hate on the stratics irc servers. If you want to go there to talk to him, don't **SMURF**ing spam him and do stupid **SMURF**. We'll lose a valuable opportunity at fixing our **SMURF** if you grief him, or we'll just make a private channel just for him and do invites only. We got alot accomplished this weekend. I hope you all enjoy the fixes that go live soon and appreciate the effect you had on making them through messageboard discussion. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
