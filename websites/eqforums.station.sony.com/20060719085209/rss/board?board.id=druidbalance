      <description>Seeks to nerf reptile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reptile skin has an effectiveness disparity based on the heal AA's of&#xD;
the target of the spell. Any class with a heal AA can crit reptile&#xD;
skin, although crit heal AA's we do not believe were ever intended to&#xD;
affect a spell which is cast upon you, rather a spell which you cast.&#xD;
This has led to a disparity in effectiveness in the tanking world. Can&#xD;
we get a confirmation that this will be addressed so that Reptile Skin&#xD;
heals everyone the same?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>i'll keep this short, Would it be so bad if druids got a&amp;nbsp; vary efficient heal? im not a druid but all i know is when we average 3 clerics a night we cant raid, yet have like 2-3 drudis on sidelines that are not even considered to be decent healers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;lets say something like 4-5k, 7-8 sec cast time 100-200 mana. something that could be used constently like ch for these 15-20+ min fights (which is everything post anguish now days)to help keep the mt up and help guidls that cant get more then 3 clerics on average a night hehe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Possible class Changes? More Group Usefulness</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=druidbalance&amp;message.id=9535#M9535</link>
      <description>I have been playing a druid for about 4-5 years now. I probably solo'd through the 50's and such and up to 65 in PoStorms. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
After level 66 druids like me had to start grouping again to get any amount of decent experience (after the charm nerf). &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I find grouping to be the most challanging thing for a druid right now.&#xD;
In groups they are just not as desired as other classes on either side&#xD;
of the spectrum. I get into most groups because i walk into zones and&#xD;
start asking people if they have any room. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I don't get asked to join groups.... why?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
The reason and the solution to this problem are fairly complicated and&#xD;
I do not believe that the proposed "modes" will be of any use to me. In&#xD;
a group tides can change very quickly. Most of the time in an exp group&#xD;
where mobs are hitting in the 1500-2k range (and beyond), my job as a&#xD;
druid is to dps (if you call it that) and to spot heal if someone other&#xD;
than the tank gets aggro.&amp;nbsp; The proposed changes would make my spot heal&#xD;
rather useless and my nukes only slightly better.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
If im the groups main healer, all I am is a very very weak cleric with&#xD;
a 5k "big heal" that never crits (at least ive never seen it crit with&#xD;
max healing aa's). You all say that druids can be group healer and do&#xD;
fantastic dps (an exaggeration) at the same time. This is simply&#xD;
untrue...&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
With most tanks being in the 14k-17k (most single group situations) our&#xD;
meager 5k heal (5.7ish with aa's) needs to be casted almost constantly&#xD;
just to keep up... which gives druids at a HUGE mana deficiency. I&#xD;
believe the problem here is that while druids are semi-good at&#xD;
everything... they dont have the mana pools or regen to fill out their&#xD;
shorts (or bra's for you females).&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
When I ask myself what a druid is good for in a group, only one word&#xD;
comes to mind... Safety. We are a safety net class, we deal a little&#xD;
dps here, nuke a bit here... and evac when we have to. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
On my server (bertox) I see more druids lfg than any other class. This&#xD;
only fuels my argument above.... Druids are just not really desireable&#xD;
in groups. We need something extra... i would like to see this extra&#xD;
thing go towards our dps, our mana regen abilities, or the mana cost of&#xD;
our spells.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Throughout the levels, mana regen has always been a problem.... now as&#xD;
a more mature character with 12 mana regen coming from items and&#xD;
another 12 coming from self spells (oak and mask) the problem still&#xD;
exists. We are the only class (besides clerics) in a groupable&#xD;
situation that does not have some strong form of alternate mana&#xD;
regeneration.... we regen like hybrids, and still dont have as much&#xD;
usefulness for one thing or another. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I say to fix the druid problem, we need, less casting time and mana&#xD;
cost on our heals, a greater big heal with a chance to crit just like&#xD;
any other heal, and less mana cost and lower resist rate on our nuke&#xD;
and dot spells. Also some aa's that would increase our burst dps&#xD;
further, or maybe a spell line of pets. We are guardians of nature, we&#xD;
should be able to summon forth nature at our will in some form. These&#xD;
changes in one form or another would greatly improve a druids chance of&#xD;
being asked to join a group.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I was under the perception that a druid has a very hard time being the main and only healer in a decent group until he or she gets a lot of AA'a.&amp;nbsp; Is this true?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Vengeance of the Sun ( Nerf or Bug? )</title>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Vengeance Of The Sun -&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DRU/69&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1:&lt;/b&gt; Increase Curse Counter by 16&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;2:&lt;/b&gt; Decrease Hitpoints by 408 (L69) to 412 (L70) per tick&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Duration - 5 tics&lt;br&gt;Mana - 454&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;  I often don't use the Vengeance line of spells due to the high resist rates on raid mobs, I break out this spell most often when soloing. I can't say for sure the last time I cast it ... but does anyone know when or if the damage was reduced?  I checked the patch messages but see nothing recent about changes , and alla still reports it ticking at 408 - but the other day when I broke out the spell it was ticking for 310 !! Duration seemed the same, but being at work atm I can't confirm.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; I cast it several times and it was consistant with the spell info on the spell gem. Is this a stealth nerf or did I miss something here? If 310 is intended ... I can see VERY little use for this spell now. Wasp Swarm has the same mana cost , lasts much longer (9tics), and has very low resist rates. Ticking at 289 (alla) the minimal damage difference now is far made up for its longer duration.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; I am not flaming, I am curious - Am I bugged?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;* I am at work atm - if my numbers are a bit off just blame alla, I know however the 310/tic was accurate the other day *&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>How I would like to see stances implemented</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=druidbalance&amp;message.id=9394#M9394</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I like to both heal and DPS as my druid.  As such, I feel I have a vested interest in how druids are tweaked since any benefits/detriments to either side will affect my gameplay.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;SOE acknowledges that we have shortcomings on both the healing and DPS sides.  Their idea of stances was a way to prevent overpowering the class.  However, the problems I see on each side are not the same.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I am a healer, my main problem isn't the size of my heals, it's my efficiency.  When I get a good roll, chlorotrope hits for 4500hps or a 9k crit.  I don't have my ancient spells but i do have my healing aa's maxxed and a 35% healing item.  However, spam heals are very draining on my mana pool (9k buffed).  This is especially a problem when someone other than that MT takes dmg and I need to hit them with a &amp;quot;quick&amp;quot; heal.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When I'm a DPS'er, my main problem isn't mana, it's the size of my nukes.  It isn't uncommon for me to be spam nuking on a mob and be able to keep up.  Therefore, an increase in efficiency wouldn't be as helpful to me as an increase in the size of my nukes and dots.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What I would like to see is two different stances.  Instead of being mirror images of one another, they would be tailored a bit to each side of the problem.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &amp;quot;healer&amp;quot; mode, I'd like to see a 15% mana savings to all heal spells (spam heal, ICH, reptile and the new group heal).  In keeping with SOE's initial model of the detriment being twice as big as the benefit, I would envision this stance causing my nukes to cost 30% more mana.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In &amp;quot;DPS&amp;quot; mode, I'd like to see the proposed 25% increase to damage spells (nukes and dots).  The proposed 50% detriment to healing would be in effect.  Yes, this is a big price to pay, but with the proposed 5 minute lockouts I don't think this will be a really big problem.  Besides, there's always exodus /grin&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The DPS mode doesn't need examples, since this is the same thing we've been discussing for over a year.  Let me give you some examples on the healing mode.  I'm not counting AA's or gear in any of this since they apply all around and are therefore irrelevent percentage-wise.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Druid 68 heal - No Stance  2810 hps for 691 mana ---- 4.06 hp/m&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Druid 64 ICH - No Stance 4680 hps for 600 mana ---- 7.8 hp/m&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Druid 68 heal - Healing stance 2810 hps for 587 mana ---- 4.78 hp/m&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Druid 64 ICH - Healing stance 4680 hps for 510 mana ---- 9.17 hp/m&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For comparison, let's examine some cleric heals so we can get a feel for whether these figures are overpowered&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cleric 68 heal - 3770 hps for 740 mana ---- 5.09 hp/m&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cleric 67 HoT - 1170 hps/tick for 5 ticks for 890 mana ---- 6.57 hp/m  (i believe the extra tick is inherent, correct me if i'm wrong)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cleric 70 jumbo heal - 4935 hps for 1375 mana ---- 3.59 hp/m&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cleric CH - 7500 hps for 400 mana ---- 18.75 hp/m&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our ICH is obviously not a problem since clerics would be far and away the best at that.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We approach the efficiency of a cleric with our &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;spam&amp;quot; heal.  We would be up to 94% efficiency.  However, please note that clerics are healing for 1k more (the gap gets larger as healing focus and AA's come into play).  We would still have a lower hps per minute ratio than clerics would.  Clerics also have more healing tools (rightfully so) which allows them greater flexibility and an easier time healing. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On the nuking side...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our 69 nuke (fire) would do 2201 pts of dmg for 642 mana.  3.43 dmg/mana ratio&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our 70 nuke (cold) would do 1892 pts of dmg for 495 mana.  3.82 dmg/mana ratio&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cleric's 69 chromatic nuke does 1200 pts of dmg for 375 mana.  3.2 dmg/mana ratio&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cleric's 67 nuke 1424 pts of damage for 430 mana.  3.31 dmg/mana&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Their chromatic nuke would be 94% as efficient as our fire nuke (slightly higher since we tend to debuff and that costs a bit).  Their non-chromatic would be 86% as efficient as our more efficient cold nuke. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;While we would approach clerics in healing efficiency, their heals would be bigger.  Likewise, while in healing mode, their nukes would approach ours in efficiency but our nukes would be bigger (I'll admit that the size of bigger nukes/heals has a discrepancy).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Druid AA swarm pet</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=druidbalance&amp;message.id=9371#M9371</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Been meaning to bring this up for awhile.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In DodH most of the classes, including the druid, go a swarm pet to be I think equivalent to the awesome shammy one that was given in I think OOWAR expansion.  For most classes, this included a 3/5/7ish pets depending on which level of aa the class was at (or 3/4/5).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here is my issue.  We  were given a pet too, woot. the problem is where other get multiple pets we get one that stays around for a longer period of time as you proceed into the higher levles.  it hits for a max of 350, not bad, but hits very slow, and dies if hit by anything harder then a light wind.  The largest disadvantage I see, is that is the other classes pets are hit, they at least have the rest of them to keep dpsing.  if our pet is hit, he dies period, the end of the aa for the next 25 or so minutes.  Also, sometimes he just quits attacking or if the one mob you send him after dies he will sit around and watch the rest of the battle.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;While I would prefer ot have multiples like the other classes,  this pet would be ok if he would survive some hits (viritually impossible to get a qh off on him).  I can live with one pet mind you, but please give him some defense and hitpoints then so he can survive long enough to do dps in any but the most perfect situations.  While it may seem logical to say well we give him more hps, maybe even as much as the total of the other pets.  issue is that  3x almost nothing is stil nothing so he gets one rounded anyway.  At least with multiple pets, the mob has to change targets each kill.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;  Also have done parses on mine vs others and find our seems to do substantially less.   average af about 1100 damage during his life with a max of about 1800 if he hits every time at level one (swings once it appears about every tick, but misses quite often).  I have level two and he seldom seems to get a double attack, not sure.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DPS over 30 seconds for 1100 damage is 36ish plus or minus.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DPS of bard pet i need to get the stats on but I believe guildie said it was more then double that, and that was assuming survivale of our pet.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Not sure if others have the same issue in ae's, I hope they do, but of course, do not bother using pet during for an ae mob, unless that gets changed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Just another minor, but easy to address item to consider for the issues list.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Current Stance Poll/Discussion - 3/23/06</title>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ok yall, it's been hacked and slashed to death, but seriously, we need to come up with a unified voice as to where we would like to see our class heading.  Considering Stances have been on the idea-board for over a year, and we cannot expect to see any changes for a long time.  (Remember, they've stated they had to do Shammy reinvisioning/fixes and see'ing where that takes them, before they mess with druids.)  This is &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt; the thread to discuss how it sucks they haven't been put in yet, the Dev's making announcements and not backign them up, how druids have &amp;quot;cleric-envy&amp;quot;, how druid's want everything and don't want to give up anything, or any other junk that brings the discussion off topic or otherwise derailed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The purpose is to decide if we even WANT the purposed Stance changes&lt;/strong&gt;.  It is my belief that after discussing and thinkiing about the potential changes stances would do for us, the majority of us feel that Stances WILL NOT do what they were originally thought of for: To help druids close the Effect/Efficiency gap in healing so as to make Clerics, Druids, and Shammy, and by doing this, increase the desireability of druids.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Please state if you would like to see Stances eventually implimented in the current proposed state (+25% increase, -50% decrease), and if you would like, your reasons why.  I would like to focus this specifically on if the druid community wants this or to ditch this idea, and find an alternative solution.  I would rather wait on alternatives and do that in a seperate thread if the results of this say druids don't want them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Mask of the Second Born broken?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=druidbalance&amp;message.id=9339#M9339</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;I just got the Mask of the Second Born with the Vampiric Heal focus on it and it doesnt seem to work correctly.  I noticed once i put it on that my focus emotes for that heal focus only went off 10% of the time.   Thats an approximation but thats what I saw.  My old heal focus is on my shield and it didnt seem to work right unless I took off the mask.  Without the mask, my shield focus emoted all the time on my heals to let me know the thing was working.  I know the amount of the focus varies but the RNG should be working all the time, not some of the time which seems to be the case with the mask.  Wondered if this is an issue with Vampiric Healing or the mask by itself. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Menaya&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;70 Druid of Quellious&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Happy 1st B-Day Druid Stances! - Can SOE either put them in or PLEASE kill them!</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=druidbalance&amp;message.id=9337#M9337</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Yes it's been a whole year now. May I respectfully request that SOE either put these darn things in or kill off the very idea. I no longer care one way or another - just another broken promise and lies IMHO. Am I being hard on porr SOE? I think not. A whole year and they do not have the common curtesy of saying either yeah or nay! Leaving us on the fence is not only insulting but an injustice to the class.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If SOE feels the Druid Class has been improved to the point in which stances are no longer needed then PLEASE tell us.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If SOE feels the Druid Class needs something but stances are no longer on the table then PLEASE tell us.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If SOE intends to add stances then PLEASE tell us what decade you intend to do this.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Come on now.... is it fair to keep us on the fence for over a year?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Cass&lt;/div&gt;</description>
