				<DIV>The events that did occur were more fun and innovative than an average event (excellent content).</DIV>
<DIV>But, overall I have to give the summer festival a thumbs down.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Less events than on a normal week, imo.&nbsp; In fact, I felt there we a LOT less events than on a normal week.</DIV>
<DIV>Saturday and Sunday were especially low on events during a time many people expected the most events to occur (resulting in a very high level of&nbsp;disappointment).</DIV>
<DIV>No events were posted so people could plan for them (I don't count the guild recruiting as an event).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Overall,&nbsp;a normal week of events is more fun than the summer festival was.</DIV>

				<DIV>Not that I care much anymore but....</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>1)&nbsp;Perhaps the recruiting functions should've been here at POK or Bazaar. More logical places, with more </DIV>
<DIV>incidental traffic. Nice idea of offering a port to Lake Rath, but still...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>2) Agree with another&nbsp;poster regarding activity announcements. The assumption&nbsp;appears to&nbsp;be that&nbsp;people were going to be logged in all the time. Probably not the most realistic of assumptions. Apparently, some announcements</DIV>
<DIV>started popping up in the website, but towards the end of the festival.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>3) What benefit to the general population does a race of 1st level characters provide? For fun factor, would</DIV>
<DIV>rather see a game of gnome ball between the "tall" races of each guild.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Personally I can't comment of the event as a whole, as I decided to spend the weekend at the beach. So far, have not heard any overwhelmingly positive comments in game.</DIV>

				<DIV>&nbsp;The calander is empty of events, shouldn't someone be posting the events for the rest of the month already? This months events should be full and next months worked on now.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;I also want events to start giving a start time.&nbsp; Having to logon for several hours to hurry-up and wait&nbsp;is not any fun. So what if many more people show up for events, isn't that the idea? that people pay more for events and&nbsp;know when they start?&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>When we login to stormhammer the next event should have the start time and zone announced with the "welcome to stormhammer" text.&nbsp; I want to be able to set a few hours aside in my rl work for events, 2 hours online not 6 hours online,&nbsp;please.</DIV>

<DIV>RE: Monday 62+ event<BR><BR>Believe me, if you were there at the beginning this started great, but overall was NOT a fun event. It had the potential to be one of the best ever, but just was a disaster. For those who joined it FROM THE START!!! not three hours into it (which added another hour to the overall time) they know what I am talking about. Overall the worst event ever attended and most frustrating for people who put the entire time and effort into an event.</DIV>
