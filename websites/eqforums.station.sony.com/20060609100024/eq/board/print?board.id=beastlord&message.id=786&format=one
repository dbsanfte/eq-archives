				<P>Brenlo,</P>
<P>I know you have said the fix is in the works and we need to be patient. However, let me make put the change in perspective and make a suggestion.</P>
<P>We know that the minimum size of vah-shir and barbarian pets was set larger to prevent the other bug of pet pathing that was generating a lot of flak. As far as I can tell,&nbsp;a remodel of the pets is the only long term solution and this won't happen until the new skeletal modelling system is up and running. At this stage we don't know how long this is going to be other than the fix to this is not "at the top of the list".</P>
<P>In retrospect many of us would like the option of triple shrinking the pets even if it brings back the old pathing bugs until a proper fix can be done. Resetting the size of the pets is not along task given how quickly it was changed when the original buig came in. That way we have the CHOICE of a small buggy pet or a larger bug-free pet.</P>
<DIV>This really is quite a pressing matter for those who raid in small places as you can tell from the feedback <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-wink.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></DIV>
