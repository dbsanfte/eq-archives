    <description>&lt;font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&#xD;
Welcome to another great Stratics house of commons with the developers&#xD;
of Everquest! Questions regarding the progression server are most&#xD;
welcome but we'll be answering general questions as well, so feel free&#xD;
to send them!&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Please send your&#xD;
questions to [QT]Sprite by using /msg [QT]Sprite My question here.&#xD;
Questions sent to myself or the developers will NOT be answered so&#xD;
please do not send them to us.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; We'll begin with a&#xD;
brief introduction from our guests and then proceed with the chat. Now&#xD;
would be a good time to send those questions to [QT]Sprite!&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Hello, I am Maddoc and I just post on the message boards all day&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;  Welcome to the chat -- I am Jason Mash, an Assistant Lead Designer on the EverQuest team. :)&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Evenin' everyone.  I'm Travis, lead designer for EverQuest.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Actually, I am Chris the producer for EQ&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oshran -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; MOOFilthyGnolls2Deliver4&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Hello everyone!  I'm Prathun, spells designer for EverQuest.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Oshran speaks in tongues&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kytherea -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Hi there!  I am Christina Delzer, the Community Relations Manager for EverQuest and Queen of the evil pink fuzzy bunny slipper.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Hello, I am Adam "Ngreth" Bell, Associate Game Designer, specializing in tradeskills.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Some people refer to me as Jonathan Caraker. :)&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oshran -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Bleh, bad paste.  I'm Oshran, content / AA designer for EverQuest.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Igorath* When with the pathing fix, the pet pathing portion, go live?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; The current plan is to&#xD;
release the pathing changes during the next scheduled live update,&#xD;
barring any major issues that we may find between now and then -- If&#xD;
you haven't yet, I'd suggest logging into the Test Server to check out&#xD;
the pathing changes and submit any bugs you may find.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; We are looking at mid-june for that update&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Nolrog* Can you take&#xD;
a look at the GoD tradeskill quests, and perhaps reduce the number of&#xD;
combines needed for each recipe. I was doing the baking one the other&#xD;
day, and got my skill to the trivial farily quickly, but sitll had to&#xD;
do 100 or more combines to move to the next recipe. It became tedious&#xD;
and boring, and ultimately, I stopped after 20 combines on the third&#xD;
recipe.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; At this time I do not&#xD;
believe that it needs to be changed. I am open to more discussion on&#xD;
it, but I am not yet ready to change it.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Zimmerz* what will level cap be in next expansion&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; We've been planning&#xD;
on increasing the level cap to either 75 or 80. At this point, I think&#xD;
its pretty safe to say the level cap will go up to 75 with the next&#xD;
expansion.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Nolrog* Are there&#xD;
any plans on adding in an NPC, like the Seer,t hat will help you figure&#xD;
out which DoD spell missions you have completed? There are a lot of&#xD;
people that have done some here and there, but don't seem to remember&#xD;
which and would like to finish the others and get their spells.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oshran -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Most of your spell&#xD;
arc mission progress should already be tracked on EQ players. Still it&#xD;
shouldn't be too hard to make an NPC that lets you know where you stand&#xD;
on each one. I can say expect one by the patch after June's. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Spider* Will Breeze be available when the server opens? &#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; This is actually a&#xD;
common question from a number of different classes -- I need to go&#xD;
through the lists of spells and see what, if any that will need to be&#xD;
made available in the old world. Breeze specifically will likely make&#xD;
an appearance, but it may wind up being a research recipe, as opposed&#xD;
to a purchased one for this server.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Nolrog* What is the&#xD;
status of the newbie armor (on progression.) Are they in, out, or we&#xD;
going to get some modified version of them so we can get something&#xD;
other than cloth and patchwork to start?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;  I&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; I have a couple of&#xD;
options for handling this armor, from creating new armor to replace it,&#xD;
to coming up with some new recommended level formulas that will more&#xD;
adequately deal with the stats on this armor, to completely disabling&#xD;
the recipes / quests.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; I've not decided&#xD;
which way I want to go yet, as I've been spending most of my time&#xD;
getting the core systems in place that the server needs to run. I'll be&#xD;
looking into that more next week.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Nolrog* What's the latest information on boats?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; At this point, some&#xD;
of the newer boats in the game (such as the ones that go to and from&#xD;
Abysmal Sea) are working. We’re looking into ways to get the older&#xD;
boats working, but don’t have an ETA of when that may occur.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Nolrog* There is&#xD;
some support for the idea of having Beastlords and Berserkers at&#xD;
launch. Is there any chance Beastlords and berserkers can become global&#xD;
features and not tied to expansions?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Berserkers and&#xD;
Beastlords are features of an expansion, which means that they cannot&#xD;
be created until that expansion -- That will hold true on this server&#xD;
as well.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Gideon* Could you&#xD;
please place a banker in Surefall Glade? If the goblins in Runnyeye can&#xD;
have two, could the Half Elves have one in their starting city for&#xD;
Druids and Rangers?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; You mean the&#xD;
residents of Surefall don't want to hide their money in mattresses&#xD;
anymore? Yeah, there should be a banker anywhere a player can start, so&#xD;
we'll make sure one gets put in there if there isn't one already.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Darzon* There was a&#xD;
reference to a set period of time before the next expansion can be&#xD;
unlocked - is there any rough estimate as to how long that time might&#xD;
be per expansion?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; The set period of&#xD;
time is the absolute minimum amount of time that we can envision the&#xD;
expansion being unlocked, considering the time needed to gain gear,&#xD;
complete quests, and discover the content needed to unlock the next&#xD;
expansion. This timeframe is more a means for us to keep the majority&#xD;
of the player's experience on the server from being ruined by that of a&#xD;
few potential hackers.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;  I don't expect that, during the normal course of the server, that these times will even be encountered.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Loral* Is there any update on the release of new player models?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; To be honest, no update right now.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; We are working on some ideas in our "lab" to figure out a good, cost effetive way to do this.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; We have new and good ideas that we are trying to put to the test but no real information right now.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Nolrog* Will optional zones, such as Jaggedpine and Stonebrunt be available at the start? If not, then when?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Over the last couple&#xD;
of weeks, I've spent most of my time getting the core systems in place&#xD;
to make this server ready for the Beta, which means that I've not had a&#xD;
lot of time to get this stuff looked at -- I've been looking at some of&#xD;
it today, and there are certainly some problematic areas for each of&#xD;
them.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; I may be able to&#xD;
leave the zones up, but disable certain key NPC's that have the&#xD;
potential of introducing loot to the world that's too powerful for the&#xD;
era, which is what I'm in the process of investigating (what I've been&#xD;
doing today).&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;  Once I have a final answer on all those zones, I'll make sure it gets posted. :)&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Croix_FV* In the DoD&#xD;
release lore note, Nedaria finally opened her eyes and King Thex&#xD;
appeared possessed in the same manner as Calliav, yet these elements do&#xD;
not seem to factor into PoR lore. Are these issues dead or will they be&#xD;
a part of the next expansion?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oshran -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; As EverQuest&#xD;
continues to evolve, we continually go back to unfinished story&#xD;
threads. Mayong Mistmoore was a good case in point. There are no&#xD;
immediate plans for Thex or Calliav, but I certainly wouldn't rule them&#xD;
out of the running either. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Nolrog* Now that&#xD;
LDoN raids have been revamped as per a recent post on EQLive, is there&#xD;
any ETA on the review/revamp of the rest of LDoN (ie: missions, point&#xD;
awards and LDoN item costs...) ?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; I don't have an exact&#xD;
timeframe, but it is something that I'd like to get done for the launch&#xD;
of the Progression Server -- I've already queried the items and gotten&#xD;
some support for it (which will also make researched LdoN spells easier&#xD;
to implement), I just need to do the evaluation, and then the point&#xD;
cost adjustments and get them pushed out to Test.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Cinexa* Ok so now&#xD;
that the Bristlebane's food challenge is solved - what will be done&#xD;
about the 1. no drop / drop? 2. extreme scarcity of certain ingredients&#xD;
(horsemeat, wheat, shrooms) 3. after allllll that work only getting ONE&#xD;
out of that combine seems pretty cruel ...thanks for listening guys =)&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 1 - The Bristlebane's&#xD;
Challenge and Bristlebane's Challenge Meats will be changed to No Drop&#xD;
at the next patch (the change can already be seen on test)&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 2 - The Scarce items&#xD;
will stay scarce. We do not want everyone to have this sandwich and we&#xD;
want it to be a challenge for those that do get it.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 3 - Same as 2, for the same reason.  And from a Lore standpoint, this is one HUGE sandwich that lasts for five hours.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Nolrog* Will the Shared Bank be taken out untill a few expansions later?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; The shared bank will&#xD;
likely stay in (it's still in and working on the server as it is) -- I&#xD;
really don't see a need for people to have to drop-trade gear between&#xD;
characters again, that just seems silly to me. :)&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Loral* Has there been any thought to adding cross-server missions or monster missions?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; This comes up from time to time.  It’s an interesting idea, but not one that is feasible with how our systems work.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Keltrein* Will there&#xD;
be a tweak/fix for the trap AEs going off before getting in range to&#xD;
disarm it? (Having to get almost on top of it IE : trap in Dranik&#xD;
Sewers )&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; I went through the&#xD;
traps a bit ago to figure out why this was occurring. In a lot of&#xD;
cases, it just has to do with the placement of the trap now that it&#xD;
requires you to click on it to disarm it and we have to address those&#xD;
one by one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; I do plan to&#xD;
increase the sense/disarm distance of traps across the board, though,&#xD;
to give a little more leeway between the range to sense them and that&#xD;
to trigger them.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Loral* Revisions of&#xD;
the death system was a major topic at the Summit. Has any change yet&#xD;
been decided? When will we see a change to the EQ death system?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; We’ve been discussing making some changes to the death system, but haven’t settled on anything concrete yet.  &#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; The only significant&#xD;
change we know we want to do is to allow players to “hover” over their&#xD;
corpse when they die and away a rez. This will help players from having&#xD;
to zone twice when they die, which can take a while for people with&#xD;
older systems.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Cinexa* Hi =) for&#xD;
Prathun - any chance you are tinkering with Deathknell &amp;amp; adjusting&#xD;
some of the over the top events or is Maddoc working you way too hard&#xD;
?!&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;  He doesn't have time to answer that question.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;  (kidding!) :)&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; And hey, how let him in this chat anyway?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; My changes to the&#xD;
first event in Deathknell have been posted in the Veteran's forum,&#xD;
though I am considering scaling those back in light of the fact that&#xD;
the event has been successfully completed several times now.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; The upcoming events&#xD;
may also need fine-tuning, as high end content always does, and I'll be&#xD;
anxiously awaiting the feedback of players that are raiding the zone.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; One thing I do want&#xD;
to change as soon as possible is the lockout timer mechanism. Currently&#xD;
it works in the same manner as Inktu`ta, with a full-zone lockout for&#xD;
completing any event.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; When I'd rather each event have its own lockout, similar to Tacvi / Anguish / Demi-Plane of Blood.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Maddoc is telling me to get back to work. :(&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;  *cracks the whip*&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Gideon* Any plans for a high level upgrade for the druid spell Spirit of Cheetah?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; I haven't made any&#xD;
concrete plans for upcoming druid spells, but I will see if an upgrade&#xD;
to Cheetah is worth adding in. Thanks!&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *FirePuff* With the&#xD;
Combine, will the opportunity come up at some point to switch many&#xD;
quests of older expansions to the task system? Or is this system tied&#xD;
to the expansion it was released with?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Tharkis* This is a&#xD;
question for prathun. At the fan faire you commented that all spells&#xD;
should have some reason to be used / worth casting. In that reguard a&#xD;
very large part of the shaman class would very much like our DoD spells&#xD;
revisited , much in the way shaman GoD spells had to be revisited to&#xD;
make them usefull to the shaman class. Is there any chance of this&#xD;
occuring? Thank you!&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; oops my mistake&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Firepuff is currently being answered, Tharkis will be answered next&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;  I looked into the feasibility of this a while back when we revamped Freeport&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; When I looked at it,&#xD;
there was some functionality in the old system that wasn't supported in&#xD;
the new system -- We now have that functionality, so I'd be able to&#xD;
convert about 70% of the actual quests into tasks, but the dialogues&#xD;
would need to be rewritten as well&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; The short answer is,&#xD;
it won't be happening for the Progression Server, but it's not&#xD;
something I'm giving up on -- Hopefully, when we revamp the next&#xD;
starting-city, we'll be able to convert their quests as well.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Tharkis* This is a&#xD;
question for prathun. At the fan faire you commented that all spells&#xD;
should have some reason to be used / worth casting. In that reguard a&#xD;
very large part of the shaman class would very much like our DoD spells&#xD;
revisited , much in the way shaman GoD spells had to be revisited to&#xD;
make them usefull to the shaman class. Is there any chance of this&#xD;
occuring? Thank you!&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Though not every&#xD;
spell can be the "best spell in the game", it stands to reason that new&#xD;
spells should have some use, even if it's situational. I've been&#xD;
planning to go back and look over the PoR spells across the board, when&#xD;
time allows, to address the tuning of any spells that aren't currently&#xD;
worth memorizing.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Shaman* Will NPC&#xD;
casters ever have to follow the same spell casting rules for line of&#xD;
sight and indoor/outdoor restriction as players have to follow?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; NPCs follow their&#xD;
own rules mainly because they’re nowhere near as intelligent as a real&#xD;
player so they need all the help they can get to remain challenging. I&#xD;
can’t really see that changing unless the NPC AI was greatly improved&#xD;
first.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Cinexa* From a SK in&#xD;
our guild (slithinknott) -- when's harmtouch getting a look see / fix /&#xD;
whatever - (i don't care about HT - just asking for him)&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oshran -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; We'll be revisiting a&#xD;
lot of class abilities via the next batch of AAs. Harm Touch will&#xD;
likely get an upgrade at that time (no date, but ballpark... sometime&#xD;
in the fall). &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Shaman* A few dev&#xD;
chats ago, it was mentioned that risk versus reward for the DoN&#xD;
missions was going to be re-evaluated. Is this still going to happen?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; One of the&#xD;
challenges of point based systems like DoN and LDoN are that players&#xD;
tend to flock to a single mission and do that over and over for the&#xD;
reward because it’s the easiest they can find. There will always be an&#xD;
easiest mission, so under the current system the best we can do is sort&#xD;
of shift that around from time to time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; As way of a more&#xD;
permanent solution to the problem, we’re looking into setting up a&#xD;
system that will dynamically change the points a mission is worth based&#xD;
on how often it is done. So if people are doing a mission a lot, that&#xD;
mission won’t be worth as many points encouraging people to try a wide&#xD;
variety of missions instead of just doing the same one over and over.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Mindmixer* are&#xD;
certain spells going to be locked out of game til expansion where it&#xD;
came from is unlocked like Tiny companion ect&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Some spells will be&#xD;
locked out, yes, though most of the general-purpose / convenience&#xD;
spells will probably get migrated to the old world in some fashion --&#xD;
Tiny Companion, much like Breeze, will make an appearance in the&#xD;
original game. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Keltrein* Has there been any behind-the-scenes aggro tweaks? it's been a little wierd at times...&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; We haven’t made any&#xD;
changes to the aggro systems recently that would be on live servers.&#xD;
The only recent change is to the success rate of the taunt ability, but&#xD;
that is only on the test server right now.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Sundabar* This&#xD;
question is in regards to the later stages of the progression server. I&#xD;
haven't played Everquest past GoD, but as I understand it GoD and OoW&#xD;
were intended to be the same expansion, which is why without level 70&#xD;
GoD endgame was essentially unbeatable until OoW was released. I'm not&#xD;
really interested in the politics of why these were broken into two&#xD;
expansions, but will the developers take note of this when the tim&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Ah, a common misconception. =)&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; While we were&#xD;
anticipating a small level increase between Gates and Omens, and the&#xD;
two expansions share the same story arc, they were distinct creations&#xD;
each with their development cycle and slightly different teams.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; But they are no more the same expansion than Darkhollow and Prophecy of Ro were the same.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; They will be unlocked separately on the Progression server.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Chanaluss* for&#xD;
several years, the magician fire pet after level 50 was deemed useless&#xD;
by the magician community. over these years, small changes have&#xD;
occured, but the pet still retains its main issues, and as a result, no&#xD;
magician would dare use it. is there any hope left for this spell arc?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Feedback from the mage community seems to suggest that the fire pet is, well, worthless.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; I'm interested in&#xD;
changing the pet's abilities so that it does have a niche in the mage's&#xD;
arsenal, either by increasing the effectiveness of it's spell casting,&#xD;
or giving it more mana regeneration, or higher survivability, or&#xD;
something else entirely.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; That's it for this&#xD;
one folks! Please join us next time right here on Stratics IRC. The&#xD;
logs will be up on http://eq.stratics.com shortly.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Thanks for coming!&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Thank you for joining us in the chat!  Please test the progression server if you have a chance! =)&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Thank you for having us! :)&#xD;

      <description>&lt;font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&#xD;
Welcome to another great Stratics house of commons with the developers&#xD;
of Everquest! Questions regarding the progression server are most&#xD;
welcome but we'll be answering general questions as well, so feel free&#xD;
to send them!&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Please send your&#xD;
questions to [QT]Sprite by using /msg [QT]Sprite My question here.&#xD;
Questions sent to myself or the developers will NOT be answered so&#xD;
please do not send them to us.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; We'll begin with a&#xD;
brief introduction from our guests and then proceed with the chat. Now&#xD;
would be a good time to send those questions to [QT]Sprite!&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Hello, I am Maddoc and I just post on the message boards all day&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;  Welcome to the chat -- I am Jason Mash, an Assistant Lead Designer on the EverQuest team. :)&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Evenin' everyone.  I'm Travis, lead designer for EverQuest.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Actually, I am Chris the producer for EQ&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oshran -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; MOOFilthyGnolls2Deliver4&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Hello everyone!  I'm Prathun, spells designer for EverQuest.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Oshran speaks in tongues&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kytherea -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Hi there!  I am Christina Delzer, the Community Relations Manager for EverQuest and Queen of the evil pink fuzzy bunny slipper.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Hello, I am Adam "Ngreth" Bell, Associate Game Designer, specializing in tradeskills.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Some people refer to me as Jonathan Caraker. :)&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oshran -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Bleh, bad paste.  I'm Oshran, content / AA designer for EverQuest.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Igorath* When with the pathing fix, the pet pathing portion, go live?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; The current plan is to&#xD;
release the pathing changes during the next scheduled live update,&#xD;
barring any major issues that we may find between now and then -- If&#xD;
you haven't yet, I'd suggest logging into the Test Server to check out&#xD;
the pathing changes and submit any bugs you may find.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; We are looking at mid-june for that update&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Nolrog* Can you take&#xD;
a look at the GoD tradeskill quests, and perhaps reduce the number of&#xD;
combines needed for each recipe. I was doing the baking one the other&#xD;
day, and got my skill to the trivial farily quickly, but sitll had to&#xD;
do 100 or more combines to move to the next recipe. It became tedious&#xD;
and boring, and ultimately, I stopped after 20 combines on the third&#xD;
recipe.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; At this time I do not&#xD;
believe that it needs to be changed. I am open to more discussion on&#xD;
it, but I am not yet ready to change it.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Zimmerz* what will level cap be in next expansion&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; We've been planning&#xD;
on increasing the level cap to either 75 or 80. At this point, I think&#xD;
its pretty safe to say the level cap will go up to 75 with the next&#xD;
expansion.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Nolrog* Are there&#xD;
any plans on adding in an NPC, like the Seer,t hat will help you figure&#xD;
out which DoD spell missions you have completed? There are a lot of&#xD;
people that have done some here and there, but don't seem to remember&#xD;
which and would like to finish the others and get their spells.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oshran -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Most of your spell&#xD;
arc mission progress should already be tracked on EQ players. Still it&#xD;
shouldn't be too hard to make an NPC that lets you know where you stand&#xD;
on each one. I can say expect one by the patch after June's. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Spider* Will Breeze be available when the server opens? &#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; This is actually a&#xD;
common question from a number of different classes -- I need to go&#xD;
through the lists of spells and see what, if any that will need to be&#xD;
made available in the old world. Breeze specifically will likely make&#xD;
an appearance, but it may wind up being a research recipe, as opposed&#xD;
to a purchased one for this server.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Nolrog* What is the&#xD;
status of the newbie armor (on progression.) Are they in, out, or we&#xD;
going to get some modified version of them so we can get something&#xD;
other than cloth and patchwork to start?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;  I&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; I have a couple of&#xD;
options for handling this armor, from creating new armor to replace it,&#xD;
to coming up with some new recommended level formulas that will more&#xD;
adequately deal with the stats on this armor, to completely disabling&#xD;
the recipes / quests.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; I've not decided&#xD;
which way I want to go yet, as I've been spending most of my time&#xD;
getting the core systems in place that the server needs to run. I'll be&#xD;
looking into that more next week.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Nolrog* What's the latest information on boats?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; At this point, some&#xD;
of the newer boats in the game (such as the ones that go to and from&#xD;
Abysmal Sea) are working. We’re looking into ways to get the older&#xD;
boats working, but don’t have an ETA of when that may occur.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Nolrog* There is&#xD;
some support for the idea of having Beastlords and Berserkers at&#xD;
launch. Is there any chance Beastlords and berserkers can become global&#xD;
features and not tied to expansions?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Berserkers and&#xD;
Beastlords are features of an expansion, which means that they cannot&#xD;
be created until that expansion -- That will hold true on this server&#xD;
as well.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Gideon* Could you&#xD;
please place a banker in Surefall Glade? If the goblins in Runnyeye can&#xD;
have two, could the Half Elves have one in their starting city for&#xD;
Druids and Rangers?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; You mean the&#xD;
residents of Surefall don't want to hide their money in mattresses&#xD;
anymore? Yeah, there should be a banker anywhere a player can start, so&#xD;
we'll make sure one gets put in there if there isn't one already.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Darzon* There was a&#xD;
reference to a set period of time before the next expansion can be&#xD;
unlocked - is there any rough estimate as to how long that time might&#xD;
be per expansion?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; The set period of&#xD;
time is the absolute minimum amount of time that we can envision the&#xD;
expansion being unlocked, considering the time needed to gain gear,&#xD;
complete quests, and discover the content needed to unlock the next&#xD;
expansion. This timeframe is more a means for us to keep the majority&#xD;
of the player's experience on the server from being ruined by that of a&#xD;
few potential hackers.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;  I don't expect that, during the normal course of the server, that these times will even be encountered.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Loral* Is there any update on the release of new player models?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; To be honest, no update right now.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; We are working on some ideas in our "lab" to figure out a good, cost effetive way to do this.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; We have new and good ideas that we are trying to put to the test but no real information right now.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Nolrog* Will optional zones, such as Jaggedpine and Stonebrunt be available at the start? If not, then when?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Over the last couple&#xD;
of weeks, I've spent most of my time getting the core systems in place&#xD;
to make this server ready for the Beta, which means that I've not had a&#xD;
lot of time to get this stuff looked at -- I've been looking at some of&#xD;
it today, and there are certainly some problematic areas for each of&#xD;
them.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; I may be able to&#xD;
leave the zones up, but disable certain key NPC's that have the&#xD;
potential of introducing loot to the world that's too powerful for the&#xD;
era, which is what I'm in the process of investigating (what I've been&#xD;
doing today).&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;  Once I have a final answer on all those zones, I'll make sure it gets posted. :)&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Croix_FV* In the DoD&#xD;
release lore note, Nedaria finally opened her eyes and King Thex&#xD;
appeared possessed in the same manner as Calliav, yet these elements do&#xD;
not seem to factor into PoR lore. Are these issues dead or will they be&#xD;
a part of the next expansion?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oshran -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; As EverQuest&#xD;
continues to evolve, we continually go back to unfinished story&#xD;
threads. Mayong Mistmoore was a good case in point. There are no&#xD;
immediate plans for Thex or Calliav, but I certainly wouldn't rule them&#xD;
out of the running either. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Nolrog* Now that&#xD;
LDoN raids have been revamped as per a recent post on EQLive, is there&#xD;
any ETA on the review/revamp of the rest of LDoN (ie: missions, point&#xD;
awards and LDoN item costs...) ?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; I don't have an exact&#xD;
timeframe, but it is something that I'd like to get done for the launch&#xD;
of the Progression Server -- I've already queried the items and gotten&#xD;
some support for it (which will also make researched LdoN spells easier&#xD;
to implement), I just need to do the evaluation, and then the point&#xD;
cost adjustments and get them pushed out to Test.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Cinexa* Ok so now&#xD;
that the Bristlebane's food challenge is solved - what will be done&#xD;
about the 1. no drop / drop? 2. extreme scarcity of certain ingredients&#xD;
(horsemeat, wheat, shrooms) 3. after allllll that work only getting ONE&#xD;
out of that combine seems pretty cruel ...thanks for listening guys =)&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 1 - The Bristlebane's&#xD;
Challenge and Bristlebane's Challenge Meats will be changed to No Drop&#xD;
at the next patch (the change can already be seen on test)&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 2 - The Scarce items&#xD;
will stay scarce. We do not want everyone to have this sandwich and we&#xD;
want it to be a challenge for those that do get it.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 3 - Same as 2, for the same reason.  And from a Lore standpoint, this is one HUGE sandwich that lasts for five hours.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Nolrog* Will the Shared Bank be taken out untill a few expansions later?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; The shared bank will&#xD;
likely stay in (it's still in and working on the server as it is) -- I&#xD;
really don't see a need for people to have to drop-trade gear between&#xD;
characters again, that just seems silly to me. :)&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Loral* Has there been any thought to adding cross-server missions or monster missions?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; This comes up from time to time.  It’s an interesting idea, but not one that is feasible with how our systems work.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Keltrein* Will there&#xD;
be a tweak/fix for the trap AEs going off before getting in range to&#xD;
disarm it? (Having to get almost on top of it IE : trap in Dranik&#xD;
Sewers )&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; I went through the&#xD;
traps a bit ago to figure out why this was occurring. In a lot of&#xD;
cases, it just has to do with the placement of the trap now that it&#xD;
requires you to click on it to disarm it and we have to address those&#xD;
one by one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; I do plan to&#xD;
increase the sense/disarm distance of traps across the board, though,&#xD;
to give a little more leeway between the range to sense them and that&#xD;
to trigger them.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Loral* Revisions of&#xD;
the death system was a major topic at the Summit. Has any change yet&#xD;
been decided? When will we see a change to the EQ death system?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; We’ve been discussing making some changes to the death system, but haven’t settled on anything concrete yet.  &#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; The only significant&#xD;
change we know we want to do is to allow players to “hover” over their&#xD;
corpse when they die and away a rez. This will help players from having&#xD;
to zone twice when they die, which can take a while for people with&#xD;
older systems.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Cinexa* Hi =) for&#xD;
Prathun - any chance you are tinkering with Deathknell &amp;amp; adjusting&#xD;
some of the over the top events or is Maddoc working you way too hard&#xD;
?!&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;  He doesn't have time to answer that question.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;  (kidding!) :)&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; And hey, how let him in this chat anyway?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; My changes to the&#xD;
first event in Deathknell have been posted in the Veteran's forum,&#xD;
though I am considering scaling those back in light of the fact that&#xD;
the event has been successfully completed several times now.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; The upcoming events&#xD;
may also need fine-tuning, as high end content always does, and I'll be&#xD;
anxiously awaiting the feedback of players that are raiding the zone.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; One thing I do want&#xD;
to change as soon as possible is the lockout timer mechanism. Currently&#xD;
it works in the same manner as Inktu`ta, with a full-zone lockout for&#xD;
completing any event.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; When I'd rather each event have its own lockout, similar to Tacvi / Anguish / Demi-Plane of Blood.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Maddoc is telling me to get back to work. :(&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;  *cracks the whip*&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Gideon* Any plans for a high level upgrade for the druid spell Spirit of Cheetah?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; I haven't made any&#xD;
concrete plans for upcoming druid spells, but I will see if an upgrade&#xD;
to Cheetah is worth adding in. Thanks!&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *FirePuff* With the&#xD;
Combine, will the opportunity come up at some point to switch many&#xD;
quests of older expansions to the task system? Or is this system tied&#xD;
to the expansion it was released with?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Tharkis* This is a&#xD;
question for prathun. At the fan faire you commented that all spells&#xD;
should have some reason to be used / worth casting. In that reguard a&#xD;
very large part of the shaman class would very much like our DoD spells&#xD;
revisited , much in the way shaman GoD spells had to be revisited to&#xD;
make them usefull to the shaman class. Is there any chance of this&#xD;
occuring? Thank you!&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; oops my mistake&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Firepuff is currently being answered, Tharkis will be answered next&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;  I looked into the feasibility of this a while back when we revamped Freeport&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; When I looked at it,&#xD;
there was some functionality in the old system that wasn't supported in&#xD;
the new system -- We now have that functionality, so I'd be able to&#xD;
convert about 70% of the actual quests into tasks, but the dialogues&#xD;
would need to be rewritten as well&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; The short answer is,&#xD;
it won't be happening for the Progression Server, but it's not&#xD;
something I'm giving up on -- Hopefully, when we revamp the next&#xD;
starting-city, we'll be able to convert their quests as well.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Tharkis* This is a&#xD;
question for prathun. At the fan faire you commented that all spells&#xD;
should have some reason to be used / worth casting. In that reguard a&#xD;
very large part of the shaman class would very much like our DoD spells&#xD;
revisited , much in the way shaman GoD spells had to be revisited to&#xD;
make them usefull to the shaman class. Is there any chance of this&#xD;
occuring? Thank you!&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Though not every&#xD;
spell can be the "best spell in the game", it stands to reason that new&#xD;
spells should have some use, even if it's situational. I've been&#xD;
planning to go back and look over the PoR spells across the board, when&#xD;
time allows, to address the tuning of any spells that aren't currently&#xD;
worth memorizing.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Shaman* Will NPC&#xD;
casters ever have to follow the same spell casting rules for line of&#xD;
sight and indoor/outdoor restriction as players have to follow?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; NPCs follow their&#xD;
own rules mainly because they’re nowhere near as intelligent as a real&#xD;
player so they need all the help they can get to remain challenging. I&#xD;
can’t really see that changing unless the NPC AI was greatly improved&#xD;
first.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Cinexa* From a SK in&#xD;
our guild (slithinknott) -- when's harmtouch getting a look see / fix /&#xD;
whatever - (i don't care about HT - just asking for him)&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oshran -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; We'll be revisiting a&#xD;
lot of class abilities via the next batch of AAs. Harm Touch will&#xD;
likely get an upgrade at that time (no date, but ballpark... sometime&#xD;
in the fall). &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Shaman* A few dev&#xD;
chats ago, it was mentioned that risk versus reward for the DoN&#xD;
missions was going to be re-evaluated. Is this still going to happen?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; One of the&#xD;
challenges of point based systems like DoN and LDoN are that players&#xD;
tend to flock to a single mission and do that over and over for the&#xD;
reward because it’s the easiest they can find. There will always be an&#xD;
easiest mission, so under the current system the best we can do is sort&#xD;
of shift that around from time to time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; As way of a more&#xD;
permanent solution to the problem, we’re looking into setting up a&#xD;
system that will dynamically change the points a mission is worth based&#xD;
on how often it is done. So if people are doing a mission a lot, that&#xD;
mission won’t be worth as many points encouraging people to try a wide&#xD;
variety of missions instead of just doing the same one over and over.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Mindmixer* are&#xD;
certain spells going to be locked out of game til expansion where it&#xD;
came from is unlocked like Tiny companion ect&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Some spells will be&#xD;
locked out, yes, though most of the general-purpose / convenience&#xD;
spells will probably get migrated to the old world in some fashion --&#xD;
Tiny Companion, much like Breeze, will make an appearance in the&#xD;
original game. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Keltrein* Has there been any behind-the-scenes aggro tweaks? it's been a little wierd at times...&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; We haven’t made any&#xD;
changes to the aggro systems recently that would be on live servers.&#xD;
The only recent change is to the success rate of the taunt ability, but&#xD;
that is only on the test server right now.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Sundabar* This&#xD;
question is in regards to the later stages of the progression server. I&#xD;
haven't played Everquest past GoD, but as I understand it GoD and OoW&#xD;
were intended to be the same expansion, which is why without level 70&#xD;
GoD endgame was essentially unbeatable until OoW was released. I'm not&#xD;
really interested in the politics of why these were broken into two&#xD;
expansions, but will the developers take note of this when the tim&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Ah, a common misconception. =)&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; While we were&#xD;
anticipating a small level increase between Gates and Omens, and the&#xD;
two expansions share the same story arc, they were distinct creations&#xD;
each with their development cycle and slightly different teams.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; But they are no more the same expansion than Darkhollow and Prophecy of Ro were the same.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; They will be unlocked separately on the Progression server.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; *Chanaluss* for&#xD;
several years, the magician fire pet after level 50 was deemed useless&#xD;
by the magician community. over these years, small changes have&#xD;
occured, but the pet still retains its main issues, and as a result, no&#xD;
magician would dare use it. is there any hope left for this spell arc?&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Feedback from the mage community seems to suggest that the fire pet is, well, worthless.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; I'm interested in&#xD;
changing the pet's abilities so that it does have a niche in the mage's&#xD;
arsenal, either by increasing the effectiveness of it's spell casting,&#xD;
or giving it more mana regeneration, or higher survivability, or&#xD;
something else entirely.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; That's it for this&#xD;
one folks! Please join us next time right here on Stratics IRC. The&#xD;
logs will be up on http://eq.stratics.com shortly.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#800000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brannoc -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Thanks for coming!&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prathun -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Thank you for joining us in the chat!  Please test the progression server if you have a chance! =)&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ngreth -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Thank you for having us! :)&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raghnell -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Thanks and have a good night.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rashere -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Have a good evening all.&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color="#0000a0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kytherea -&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Thanks for joiing us, see you next month!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
