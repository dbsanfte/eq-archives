&lt;OL&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Improve Melee performance, especially in the low and mid levels. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This will most likely be considered as part of part #2 of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The community feels that there is a need for a review of the damage output a typical mid and low level Berserker is capable off. The only damage tool available at that range is Frenzy, which isn’t that much of an impact to truly define Berserkers as a true DPS class. Suggestions for improvements:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Extend the Volley line for the mid and low levels. One Volley skill every 10 levels (1 for every other Axe Summon skill we get) seems appropriate.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Addition of more low/mid level burst damage discs on different timers. The high end Berserkers start to shine with their ability to chain multiple DPS disciplines after each other, however until level level 65 all damage-oriented disciplines are on the same timer. The addition of lower level version of our Cleaving Anger and Vengeful Flurry disciplines as well as some lower level disciplines on the ‘old world’ discipline timers would be a great addition for these levels, and would great a more unified role for the Berserker across his lifetime.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Veterans Wrath - &lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Veterans Wrath has been tuned to give a lesser boost to critical hits for Berserkers and Warriors in order to counter balance the inate crit rate bonus of these classes and to give all classes approximatly the same dps increase from the AA. &lt;BR&gt;We would like to have that design decision reviewed, as we believe that this 'balance' will result in a penalty as more and more crit chance spells and focus effects (Cleave, Hastening of Salik, Berserker Epic click, Cry Havoc to name a few) are added to the game.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;3. Itemization &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is still in progress&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;There is a definite lack of Berserker only items, or ‘Berserker preferred’ items. For example there is only 1 Berserker only weapon besides the Epic weapons less than a handful of items with a Frenzy Damage modifier and equally few items with a throwing focus.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;In addition to the above the selection of available throwing weapons is very limited. The only choices besides our normal summoned axes are the Tainted Axe of Hatred and Ton Po’s Mystical Pouch / Shuriken of Eternity, and even these are no real alternative to current high end loot, so most Berserkers either wear inferior items in their range slot of leave their Axes at home and use a normal range item.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Apart from the lack of weaponry Berserkers have a distinct disadvantage in their stats since they can only wield 2Her weapons, which usually score at around 120% of the stats of comparable 1H weapons. In addition to the 80% we lose from the other weapon slot, we also lose an augmentation slot. In addition to the above mentioned lack of throwing weapons with good stats, we also lose another augmentation slot if we engage in ranged combat, because unlike bows our throwing weapons can’t really be augemented.&lt;BR&gt;Overall a lot of lost stats and we don’t even have the option to switch to 1Her combos or Bows if we wanted to.&lt;BR&gt;Solutions could be innate stat bonuses on the Primary weapon slot similar to how the Recommended level system takes stats away, or special (crafted/quested) Berserker only augmentations with a new slot added to all 2Hers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;4. War Cry Improvements / Raid utility.&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The community hopes that War Cries could be reviewed/revamped as they are the only unique ability and utility a Berserker can offer to a group or raid. The current form however does not bring enough power to the table to put the Berserkers class on the wish list of a group or raid leader. The limited impact, versatility and availability of the skill all factor into this. The community feedback and suggestions on this topic are far too lengthy and extensive to list them here, so I will only list a few short ideas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;“Is it in yet?” - The bonus from War Cries is just to small considering the long reuse time and the fact that the typical group usually won’t have more than 2 – 3 melee characters in it. In raids special arrangements can be made but even then the casting range will more often than not cause one or two members to miss the effect.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;It’s too One-dimensional - We only have one type of War Cry, which makes it a “no brains” skill: As soon as the raid leader yells ‘Burn!!!’ or the group pulls a named mob we push the button and hope that someone notices. If we had different types of War Cries, i.e. one that boosts offensive powers while another one boosts the defensive abilities, we’d have to evaluate the situation and chose an appropriate tactic. Note: We do not anticipate getting a defensive type disc for Berserkers that would allow us to close in on the tanking skills of Plate classes. We are mainly looking for group/raid utility and would therefore be very happy about skills that only affect the group and not the Berserker.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;All for one and one for all - AE War Cries are still a big item on our wish list. If you don’t want powerful group disciplines to be AE’d then please create a special AE line for raids that is tuned appropriately. If you fear that AE War Cries would lessen the desire for multiple Berserkers on a raid, make the AE line shorter duration or add offensive/defensive War Cries (see above).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;We didn't recieve a new Warcry since Gates of Discord.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;5. Throwing - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Some improvements are being considered as part of round #1 of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Throwing has a few problems that need to be addressed:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The lack of good throwing weapons and the disadvantage of throwing weapons vs. a bow (see above).&lt;BR&gt;It would be absolutely great if the throwing skill could be reworked to work more closely to how Archery works. A bow like item in the range slot, i.e. a throwing glove or throwing satchel, that isn’t thrown away but rather enhances the range, damage and delay of the ammo (the actual axes, shurikens, knives, stones, etc). These bow-equivalents could be seeded across existing group, raid and crafting content and could be shared with Monks, Rogues, Beastlords, etc.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The cost of summoned axes / lack of an endless quiver type AA make our throwing a heavy burden on our purses. It’s especially a bummer for those of us that wish to kite as a form of soloing. Please do the right thing and remove the cost for the components and/or give us an Endless Quiver AA. It’s a really inappropriate money sink, which also scares off new players from trying this class.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Another problem with the current throwing weapons is the range of our throwing axes. The best one is currently 175 which is not enough to 'dodge' from AEs in raid encounters. Therefore, throwing isn't even a viable alternative to melee combat in those situations. Please extend it beyond 200 - any lvl 55+ bow has a range of 175 and can be easily extended beyond 200 with cheap arrows (even mage summoned arrows)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;6. Combat Abilities - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Our Jolt line is on the same timer as our ‘offensive’ / agro-creating skills. The problem with this is that we very rarely grab agro from melee damage alone. In normal circumstances it only happens right after we used a stun, snare or volley attack and then our Jolt line is unavailable for 12 seconds.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Snares: This ability line scales very poorly as the only difference from upgrading is the resist adjust field, which does not seem to make that much of a difference. The price for that upgrade is a great increase in endurance cost as well as monetary component cost (see #6 Throwing). We would appreciate if the duration and the Snare percentage would scale up with each rank as well. Right now they are all 55% snare with a 1 minute duration. I would suggest a 35%, 1minute, 45%, 2minute, 55% 3minute, 65% 4minute progression.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Stuns: There is a gap in the stun progression in the mid 50s. The level 40 stun skill can stun NPCs up to level 55 while the next upgrade to the Stun line is available at level 60. Most NPCs in the lower planes where a typical mid 50s player would hunt are above level 55 and therefore immune to this stun.&lt;BR&gt;Another smaller gap appears between in the 65ish – 68 range as the level 60 stun works on NPCs up to level 65 and the next stun upgrade occurs at level 68; although this gap isn’t as dramatic as the previous one as most exp spots for that level range feature numerous NPCs of level 65 or below.&lt;BR&gt;I don’t really have an easy solution for this problem other than reviewing all the stun and adding more ranks to make the progression smoother, always allowing the Berserker to stun NPCs at least a few levels above him.&lt;BR&gt;For the high ends this problem returns again as the highest level stun works on NPCs up to level 70, which isn’t sufficient to work in places like Riftseekers or the Nest, therefore many have asked for a new stun or a stun AA that raises the level up to 72/73ish&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;7. Endurance Regeneration - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The innate endurance regeneration rate does not improve between level 65 and 70, while all combat abilities have become more expensive. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;We would very much like to see endurance regeneration items and/or spells to be added to the game. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The slow rate of endurance regeneration becomes especially noticeable after resurrections or raid ‘burn’ situations. In the high end it can take 20 minutes or longer of pure idle time to recover from 0 endurance to full. Some ‘resting’ skill that allows us to regenerate endurance faster but adds some negatives to avoid abuse, i.e. all disc / combat ability timers greyed out for a 5 – 10 minutes or limited movement and attack speed while ‘resting’, would be appreciated.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;OL&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8. Savage Spirit AA -&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Some of the AA disciplines are falling short of the expectations, especially Savage Spirit. The randomish nature and the fact that it doesn't stack with Veterans Wrath oftentimes cause the disc to produce only medicore results and not 'massive damage' as indicated in the AA description. We'd like this skill reviewed to show much more reliable and 'massive' results, i.e. a shorter duration disc with some garuanteed big blows.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9. Desperation AA&amp;nbsp;- &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Desperation is currently one of the 'Hate it or love it' AAs as the concept of the skill is very well recieved, but the actual performance is in most cases lacking. The skill is very hard and very very risky to use effectively and the reward seems to be too low for that.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10.

Unlike other high dps melee classes they can't just Feign Death or Evade from combat, but only have a 12 second recast Jolt ability that shares a timer with our Volley skill. We find our Jolt to be very ineffective as the amount of hate it lowers seems very low.&lt;BR&gt;We would like to see our Jolt line being reviewed and/or other methods for agro management being considered. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;OL&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Improve Melee performance, especially in the low and mid levels. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This will most likely be considered as part of part #2 of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The community feels that there is a need for a review of the damage output a typical mid and low level Berserker is capable off. The only damage tool available at that range is Frenzy, which isn’t that much of an impact to truly define Berserkers as a true DPS class. Suggestions for improvements:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Extend the Volley line for the mid and low levels. One Volley skill every 10 levels (1 for every other Axe Summon skill we get) seems appropriate.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Addition of more low/mid level burst damage discs on different timers. The high end Berserkers start to shine with their ability to chain multiple DPS disciplines after each other, however until level level 65 all damage-oriented disciplines are on the same timer. The addition of lower level version of our Cleaving Anger and Vengeful Flurry disciplines as well as some lower level disciplines on the ‘old world’ discipline timers would be a great addition for these levels, and would great a more unified role for the Berserker across his lifetime.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Veterans Wrath - &lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;NEW&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Veterans Wrath has been tuned to give a lesser boost to critical hits for Berserkers and Warriors in order to counter balance the inate crit rate bonus of these classes and to give all classes approximatly the same dps increase from the AA. &lt;BR&gt;We would like to have that design decision reviewed, as we believe that this 'balance' will result in a penalty as more and more crit chance spells and focus effects (Cleave, Hastening of Salik, Berserker Epic click, Cry Havoc to name a few) are added to the game.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;3. Itemization &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is still in progress&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;There is a definite lack of Berserker only items, or ‘Berserker preferred’ items. For example there is only 1 Berserker only weapon besides the Epic weapons less than a handful of items with a Frenzy Damage modifier and equally few items with a throwing focus.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;In addition to the above the selection of available throwing weapons is very limited. The only choices besides our normal summoned axes are the Tainted Axe of Hatred and Ton Po’s Mystical Pouch / Shuriken of Eternity, and even these are no real alternative to current high end loot, so most Berserkers either wear inferior items in their range slot of leave their Axes at home and use a normal range item.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Apart from the lack of weaponry Berserkers have a distinct disadvantage in their stats since they can only wield 2Her weapons, which usually score at around 120% of the stats of comparable 1H weapons. In addition to the 80% we lose from the other weapon slot, we also lose an augmentation slot. In addition to the above mentioned lack of throwing weapons with good stats, we also lose another augmentation slot if we engage in ranged combat, because unlike bows our throwing weapons can’t really be augemented.&lt;BR&gt;Overall a lot of lost stats and we don’t even have the option to switch to 1Her combos or Bows if we wanted to.&lt;BR&gt;Solutions could be innate stat bonuses on the Primary weapon slot similar to how the Recommended level system takes stats away, or special (crafted/quested) Berserker only augmentations with a new slot added to all 2Hers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;4. War Cry Improvements / Raid utility.&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The community hopes that War Cries could be reviewed/revamped as they are the only unique ability and utility a Berserker can offer to a group or raid. The current form however does not bring enough power to the table to put the Berserkers class on the wish list of a group or raid leader. The limited impact, versatility and availability of the skill all factor into this. The community feedback and suggestions on this topic are far too lengthy and extensive to list them here, so I will only list a few short ideas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;“Is it in yet?” - The bonus from War Cries is just to small considering the long reuse time and the fact that the typical group usually won’t have more than 2 – 3 melee characters in it. In raids special arrangements can be made but even then the casting range will more often than not cause one or two members to miss the effect.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;It’s too One-dimensional - We only have one type of War Cry, which makes it a “no brains” skill: As soon as the raid leader yells ‘Burn!!!’ or the group pulls a named mob we push the button and hope that someone notices. If we had different types of War Cries, i.e. one that boosts offensive powers while another one boosts the defensive abilities, we’d have to evaluate the situation and chose an appropriate tactic. Note: We do not anticipate getting a defensive type disc for Berserkers that would allow us to close in on the tanking skills of Plate classes. We are mainly looking for group/raid utility and would therefore be very happy about skills that only affect the group and not the Berserker.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;All for one and one for all - AE War Cries are still a big item on our wish list. If you don’t want powerful group disciplines to be AE’d then please create a special AE line for raids that is tuned appropriately. If you fear that AE War Cries would lessen the desire for multiple Berserkers on a raid, make the AE line shorter duration or add offensive/defensive War Cries (see above).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;We didn't recieve a new Warcry since Gates of Discord.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;5. Throwing - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Some improvements are being considered as part of round #1 of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Throwing has a few problems that need to be addressed:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The lack of good throwing weapons and the disadvantage of throwing weapons vs. a bow (see above).&lt;BR&gt;It would be absolutely great if the throwing skill could be reworked to work more closely to how Archery works. A bow like item in the range slot, i.e. a throwing glove or throwing satchel, that isn’t thrown away but rather enhances the range, damage and delay of the ammo (the actual axes, shurikens, knives, stones, etc). These bow-equivalents could be seeded across existing group, raid and crafting content and could be shared with Monks, Rogues, Beastlords, etc.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The cost of summoned axes / lack of an endless quiver type AA make our throwing a heavy burden on our purses. It’s especially a bummer for those of us that wish to kite as a form of soloing. Please do the right thing and remove the cost for the components and/or give us an Endless Quiver AA. It’s a really inappropriate money sink, which also scares off new players from trying this class.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

&lt;LI&gt;We didn't recieve a new Warcry since Gates of Discord.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;5. Throwing - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Some improvements are being considered as part of round #1 of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Throwing has a few problems that need to be addressed:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The lack of good throwing weapons and the disadvantage of throwing weapons vs. a bow (see above).&lt;BR&gt;It would be absolutely great if the throwing skill could be reworked to work more closely to how Archery works. A bow like item in the range slot, i.e. a throwing glove or throwing satchel, that isn’t thrown away but rather enhances the range, damage and delay of the ammo (the actual axes, shurikens, knives, stones, etc). These bow-equivalents could be seeded across existing group, raid and crafting content and could be shared with Monks, Rogues, Beastlords, etc.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The cost of summoned axes / lack of an endless quiver type AA make our throwing a heavy burden on our purses. It’s especially a bummer for those of us that wish to kite as a form of soloing. Please do the right thing and remove the cost for the components and/or give us an Endless Quiver AA. It’s a really inappropriate money sink, which also scares off new players from trying this class.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Another problem with the current throwing weapons is the range of our throwing axes. The best one is currently 175 which is not enough to 'dodge' from AEs in raid encounters. Therefore, throwing isn't even a viable alternative to melee combat in those situations. Please extend it beyond 200 - any lvl 55+ bow has a range of 175 and can be easily extended beyond 200 with cheap arrows (even mage summoned arrows)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;6. Combat Abilities - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Our Jolt line is on the same timer as our ‘offensive’ / agro-creating skills. The problem with this is that we very rarely grab agro from melee damage alone. In normal circumstances it only happens right after we used a stun, snare or volley attack and then our Jolt line is unavailable for 12 seconds.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Snares: This ability line scales very poorly as the only difference from upgrading is the resist adjust field, which does not seem to make that much of a difference. The price for that upgrade is a great increase in endurance cost as well as monetary component cost (see #6 Throwing). We would appreciate if the duration and the Snare percentage would scale up with each rank as well. Right now they are all 55% snare with a 1 minute duration. I would suggest a 35%, 1minute, 45%, 2minute, 55% 3minute, 65% 4minute progression.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Stuns: There is a gap in the stun progression in the mid 50s. The level 40 stun skill can stun NPCs up to level 55 while the next upgrade to the Stun line is available at level 60. Most NPCs in the lower planes where a typical mid 50s player would hunt are above level 55 and therefore immune to this stun.&lt;BR&gt;Another smaller gap appears between in the 65ish – 68 range as the level 60 stun works on NPCs up to level 65 and the next stun upgrade occurs at level 68; although this gap isn’t as dramatic as the previous one as most exp spots for that level range feature numerous NPCs of level 65 or below.&lt;BR&gt;I don’t really have an easy solution for this problem other than reviewing all the stun and adding more ranks to make the progression smoother, always allowing the Berserker to stun NPCs at least a few levels above him.&lt;BR&gt;For the high ends this problem returns again as the highest level stun works on NPCs up to level 70, which isn’t sufficient to work in places like Riftseekers or the Nest, therefore many have asked for a new stun or a stun AA that raises the level up to 72/73ish&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;7. Endurance Regeneration - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The innate endurance regeneration rate does not improve between level 65 and 70, while all combat abilities have become more expensive. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;We would very much like to see endurance regeneration items and/or spells to be added to the game. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The slow rate of endurance regeneration becomes especially noticeable after resurrections or raid ‘burn’ situations. In the high end it can take 20 minutes or longer of pure idle time to recover from 0 endurance to full. Some ‘resting’ skill that allows us to regenerate endurance faster but adds some negatives to avoid abuse, i.e. all disc / combat ability timers greyed out for a 5 – 10 minutes or limited movement and attack speed while ‘resting’, would be appreciated.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;OL&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8. Savage Spirit AA &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Some of the AA disciplines are falling short of the expectations, especially Savage Spirit. The randomish nature and the fact that it doesn't stack with Veterans Wrath oftentimes cause the disc to produce only medicore results and not 'massive damage' as indicated in the AA description. We'd like this skill reviewed to show much more reliable and 'massive' results, i.e. a shorter duration disc with some garuanteed big blows.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9. Desperation AA&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Desperation is currently one of the 'Hate it or love it' AAs as the concept of the skill is very well recieved, but the actual performance is in most cases lacking. The skill is very hard and very very risky to use effectively and the reward seems to be too low for that.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The community feels that there is a need for a review of the damage output a typical mid and low level Berserker is capable off. The only damage tool available at that range is Frenzy, which isn’t that much of an impact to truly define Berserkers as a true DPS class. Suggestions for improvements:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Extend the Volley line for the mid and low levels. One Volley skill every 10 levels (1 for every other Axe Summon skill we get) seems appropriate.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Addition of more low/mid level burst damage discs on different timers. The high end Berserkers start to shine with their ability to chain multiple DPS disciplines after each other, however until level level 65 all damage-oriented disciplines are on the same timer. The addition of lower level version of our Cleaving Anger and Vengeful Flurry disciplines as well as some lower level disciplines on the ‘old world’ discipline timers would be a great addition for these levels, and would great a more unified role for the Berserker across his lifetime.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;2. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;We need a replacement for #2&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;3. Itemization &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is still in progress&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;There is a definite lack of Berserker only items, or ‘Berserker preferred’ items. For example there is only 1 Berserker only weapon besides the Epic weapons less than a handful of items with a Frenzy Damage modifier and equally few items with a throwing focus.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;In addition to the above the selection of available throwing weapons is very limited. The only choices besides our normal summoned axes are the Tainted Axe of Hatred and Ton Po’s Mystical Pouch / Shuriken of Eternity, and even these are no real alternative to current high end loot, so most Berserkers either wear inferior items in their range slot of leave their Axes at home and use a normal range item.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Apart from the lack of weaponry Berserkers have a distinct disadvantage in their stats since they can only wield 2Her weapons, which usually score at around 120% of the stats of comparable 1H weapons. In addition to the 80% we lose from the other weapon slot, we also lose an augmentation slot. In addition to the above mentioned lack of throwing weapons with good stats, we also lose another augmentation slot if we engage in ranged combat, because unlike bows our throwing weapons can’t really be augemented.&lt;BR&gt;Overall a lot of lost stats and we don’t even have the option to switch to 1Her combos or Bows if we wanted to.&lt;BR&gt;Solutions could be innate stat bonuses on the Primary weapon slot similar to how the Recommended level system takes stats away, or special (crafted/quested) Berserker only augmentations with a new slot added to all 2Hers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;4. War Cry Improvements / Raid utility.&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The community hopes that War Cries could be reviewed/revamped as they are the only unique ability and utility a Berserker can offer to a group or raid. The current form however does not bring enough power to the table to put the Berserkers class on the wish list of a group or raid leader. The limited impact, versatility and availability of the skill all factor into this. The community feedback and suggestions on this topic are far too lengthy and extensive to list them here, so I will only list a few short ideas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;“Is it in yet?” - The bonus from War Cries is just to small considering the long reuse time and the fact that the typical group usually won’t have more than 2 – 3 melee characters in it. In raids special arrangements can be made but even then the casting range will more often than not cause one or two members to miss the effect.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;It’s too One-dimensional - We only have one type of War Cry, which makes it a “no brains” skill: As soon as the raid leader yells ‘Burn!!!’ or the group pulls a named mob we push the button and hope that someone notices. If we had different types of War Cries, i.e. one that boosts offensive powers while another one boosts the defensive abilities, we’d have to evaluate the situation and chose an appropriate tactic. Note: We do not anticipate getting a defensive type disc for Berserkers that would allow us to close in on the tanking skills of Plate classes. We are mainly looking for group/raid utility and would therefore be very happy about skills that only affect the group and not the Berserker.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;All for one and one for all - AE War Cries are still a big item on our wish list. If you don’t want powerful group disciplines to be AE’d then please create a special AE line for raids that is tuned appropriately. If you fear that AE War Cries would lessen the desire for multiple Berserkers on a raid, make the AE line shorter duration or add offensive/defensive War Cries (see above).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;5. Throwing - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Some improvements are being considered as part of round #1 of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Throwing has a few problems that need to be addressed:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The lack of good throwing weapons and the disadvantage of throwing weapons vs. a bow (see above).&lt;BR&gt;It would be absolutely great if the throwing skill could be reworked to work more closely to how Archery works. A bow like item in the range slot, i.e. a throwing glove or throwing satchel, that isn’t thrown away but rather enhances the range, damage and delay of the ammo (the actual axes, shurikens, knives, stones, etc). These bow-equivalents could be seeded across existing group, raid and crafting content and could be shared with Monks, Rogues, Beastlords, etc.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The cost of summoned axes / lack of an endless quiver type AA make our throwing a heavy burden on our purses. It’s especially a bummer for those of us that wish to kite as a form of soloing. Please do the right thing and remove the cost for the components and/or give us an Endless Quiver AA. It’s a really inappropriate money sink, which also scares off new players from trying this class.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Another problem with the current throwing weapons is the range of our throwing axes. The best one is currently 175 which is not enough to 'dodge' from AEs in raid encounters. Therefore, throwing isn't even a viable alternative to melee combat in those situations. Please extend it beyond 200 - any lvl 55+ bow has a range of 175 and can be easily extended beyond 200 with cheap arrows (even mage summoned arrows)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;6. Combat Abilities - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Our Jolt line is on the same timer as our ‘offensive’ / agro-creating skills. The problem with this is that we very rarely grab agro from melee damage alone. In normal circumstances it only happens right after we used a stun, snare or volley attack and then our Jolt line is unavailable for 12 seconds.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Snares: This ability line scales very poorly as the only difference from upgrading is the resist adjust field, which does not seem to make that much of a difference. The price for that upgrade is a great increase in endurance cost as well as monetary component cost (see #6 Throwing). We would appreciate if the duration and the Snare percentage would scale up with each rank as well. Right now they are all 55% snare with a 1 minute duration. I would suggest a 35%, 1minute, 45%, 2minute, 55% 3minute, 65% 4minute progression.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Stuns: There is a gap in the stun progression in the mid 50s. The level 40 stun skill can stun NPCs up to level 55 while the next upgrade to the Stun line is available at level 60. Most NPCs in the lower planes where a typical mid 50s player would hunt are above level 55 and therefore immune to this stun.&lt;BR&gt;Another smaller gap appears between in the 65ish – 68 range as the level 60 stun works on NPCs up to level 65 and the next stun upgrade occurs at level 68; although this gap isn’t as dramatic as the previous one as most exp spots for that level range feature numerous NPCs of level 65 or below.&lt;BR&gt;I don’t really have an easy solution for this problem other than reviewing all the stun and adding more ranks to make the progression smoother, always allowing the Berserker to stun NPCs at least a few levels above him.&lt;BR&gt;For the high ends this problem returns again as the highest level stun works on NPCs up to level 70, which isn’t sufficient to work in places like Riftseekers or the Nest, therefore many have asked for a new stun or a stun AA that raises the level up to 72/73ish&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;7. Endurance Regeneration - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The innate endurance regeneration rate does not improve between level 65 and 70, while all combat abilities have become more expensive. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;We would very much like to see endurance regeneration items and/or spells to be added to the game. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The slow rate of endurance regeneration becomes especially noticeable after resurrections or raid ‘burn’ situations. In the high end it can take 20 minutes or longer of pure idle time to recover from 0 endurance to full. Some ‘resting’ skill that allows us to regenerate endurance faster but adds some negatives to avoid abuse, i.e. all disc / combat ability timers greyed out for a 5 – 10 minutes or limited movement and attack speed while ‘resting’, would be appreciated.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;OL&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8. Savage Spirit AA &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Some of the AA disciplines are falling short of the expectations, especially Savage Spirit. The randomish nature and the fact that it doesn't stack with Veterans Wrath oftentimes cause the disc to produce only medicore results and not 'massive damage' as indicated in the AA description. We'd like this skill reviewed to show much more reliable and 'massive' results, i.e. a shorter duration disc with some garuanteed big blows.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9. Desperation AA&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;NEW&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Desperation is currently one of the 'Hate it or love it' AAs as the concept of the skill is very well recieved, but the actual performance is in most cases lacking. The skill is very hard and very very risky to use effectively and the reward seems to be too low for that.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;OL&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Improve Melee performance, especially in the low and mid levels. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This will most likely be considered as part of part #2 of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The community feels that there is a need for a review of the damage output a typical mid and low level Berserker is capable off. The only damage tool available at that range is Frenzy, which isn’t that much of an impact to truly define Berserkers as a true DPS class. Suggestions for improvements:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Extend the Volley line for the mid and low levels. One Volley skill every 10 levels (1 for every other Axe Summon skill we get) seems appropriate.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Addition of more low/mid level burst damage discs on different timers. The high end Berserkers start to shine with their ability to chain multiple DPS disciplines after each other, however until level level 65 all damage-oriented disciplines are on the same timer. The addition of lower level version of our Cleaving Anger and Vengeful Flurry disciplines as well as some lower level disciplines on the ‘old world’ discipline timers would be a great addition for these levels, and would great a more unified role for the Berserker across his lifetime.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;2.Reevaluate the Endurance Cost of our Abilities. – &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is being considered as part of round #1 of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The cost of some of the abilities (especially the 3rd rank and above) as well as all Warcries seem to be a bit over the top.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;3. Itemization &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is still in progress&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;There is a definite lack of Berserker only items, or ‘Berserker preferred’ items. For example there is only 1 Berserker only weapon besides the Epic weapons less than a handful of items with a Frenzy Damage modifier and equally few items with a throwing focus.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;In addition to the above the selection of available throwing weapons is very limited. The only choices besides our normal summoned axes are the Tainted Axe of Hatred and Ton Po’s Mystical Pouch / Shuriken of Eternity, and even these are no real alternative to current high end loot, so most Berserkers either wear inferior items in their range slot of leave their Axes at home and use a normal range item.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Apart from the lack of weaponry Berserkers have a distinct disadvantage in their stats since they can only wield 2Her weapons, which usually score at around 120% of the stats of comparable 1H weapons. In addition to the 80% we lose from the other weapon slot, we also lose an augmentation slot. In addition to the above mentioned lack of throwing weapons with good stats, we also lose another augmentation slot if we engage in ranged combat, because unlike bows our throwing weapons can’t really be augemented.&lt;BR&gt;Overall a lot of lost stats and we don’t even have the option to switch to 1Her combos or Bows if we wanted to.&lt;BR&gt;Solutions could be innate stat bonuses on the Primary weapon slot similar to how the Recommended level system takes stats away, or special (crafted/quested) Berserker only augmentations with a new slot added to all 2Hers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;4. War Cry Improvements / Raid utility.&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The community hopes that War Cries could be reviewed/revamped as they are the only unique ability and utility a Berserker can offer to a group or raid. The current form however does not bring enough power to the table to put the Berserkers class on the wish list of a group or raid leader. The limited impact, versatility and availability of the skill all factor into this. The community feedback and suggestions on this topic are far too lengthy and extensive to list them here, so I will only list a few short ideas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;“Is it in yet?” - The bonus from War Cries is just to small considering the long reuse time and the fact that the typical group usually won’t have more than 2 – 3 melee characters in it. In raids special arrangements can be made but even then the casting range will more often than not cause one or two members to miss the effect.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;It’s too One-dimensional - We only have one type of War Cry, which makes it a “no brains” skill: As soon as the raid leader yells ‘Burn!!!’ or the group pulls a named mob we push the button and hope that someone notices. If we had different types of War Cries, i.e. one that boosts offensive powers while another one boosts the defensive abilities, we’d have to evaluate the situation and chose an appropriate tactic. Note: We do not anticipate getting a defensive type disc for Berserkers that would allow us to close in on the tanking skills of Plate classes. We are mainly looking for group/raid utility and would therefore be very happy about skills that only affect the group and not the Berserker.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;All for one and one for all - AE War Cries are still a big item on our wish list. If you don’t want powerful group disciplines to be AE’d then please create a special AE line for raids that is tuned appropriately. If you fear that AE War Cries would lessen the desire for multiple Berserkers on a raid, make the AE line shorter duration or add offensive/defensive War Cries (see above).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;We didn't recieve a new Warcry since Gates of Discord.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;5. Throwing - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Some improvements are being considered as part of round #1 of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Throwing has a few problems that need to be addressed:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

These bow-equivalents could be seeded across existing group, raid and crafting content and could be shared with Monks, Rogues, Beastlords, etc.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;The cost of summoned axes / lack of an endless quiver type AA make our throwing a heavy burden on our purses. It’s especially a bummer for those of us that wish to kite as a form of soloing. Please do the right thing and remove the cost for the components and/or give us an Endless Quiver AA. It’s a really inappropriate money sink, which also scares off new players from trying this class.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

&lt;OL&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Improve Overall Melee performance &lt;SPAN&gt;–&lt;FONT color=#9933ff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This will most likely be considered as part of&amp;nbsp;part #2 of&amp;nbsp;the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Berserkers aren't really happy with their general melee performance yet and feel that we need something to push us ahead of the baseline warriors to make us a true dps class. Here are some ideas for improvements:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Give us a special damage table like monks or innate bonuses like damage modifiers&amp;nbsp;(analog to Warriors mitigation bonus), higher innate crit rates than other classes, etc. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Add Specialize 2handed slash , blunt and piercing: a skill that gives a small delay reduction like the 100 hands effect before ordinary haste applies and increases accuracy. As with the caster specialization you can only choose one weapontype to master.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;An innate bane to our weapons by type, i.e. 2hb +3 undead 2hs +3 humanoid 2hp +2 whatever&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2H weapons generally have lower stats than equal level 1h-1h or 1h-shield combos. Other classes can choose which combination they want to use in order optimize their performance accordingly to the situation but Berserkers are stuck with 2h Weapons no matter what. Either increase the overall stats on 2H weapons or give Berserkers a bonus on 2H weapons (A code similar to the Recommended Level code could be used that would grant Berserkers additional 25 - 50% of the weapon stats. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Frenzy &lt;SPAN&gt;–&lt;FONT color=#9933ff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We would like to see a higher minimum damage value added for Frenzy (pre-AAs). Currently we can Frenzy for 3 points of damage. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The scaleability of this scale is very poor. It skill caps out very early at 200 and it is completely weapon independent. So between the time where a Berserker maxes out the skill (around lvl 40) and gets his Frenzy improvement AAs (usually around lvl 65 or even later). The skill is stagnant is pretty much stagnant.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reevaluate the Endurance Cost of our Abilities.&amp;nbsp;– &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is being considered as part of round #1 of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The cost of some of the abilities (especially the 3rd rank and above) as well as all Warcries seem to be a bit over the top. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;

&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;BER only Weapons - Add some BER only weapons similar to other classes. From Ssra to elemental pet weapon to Time level.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There is simply not enough class specific armor or weapons for the berserker as he progresses through the previous content.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Create a style of Berserker only type of weapons, perhaps extremely heavy weapons, or specialized throwing weapons.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Warcry Improvements –&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The effectiveness of Warcries is still nothing that makes people really *want* Berserkers. It has too little effect on the damage output of the group.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Recast time is too long for the impact of the effect.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Increase the range of Warcry. Especially in raid situations the groupmembers may spread out further than the current 60 range and will therefore miss the effect.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Add a "purify" attribute to Warcries that remove detrimental effects on the group/raid or turn them off for the duration of the Warcry. The idea is that the Warcry puts our friends in such an agitated state that they ignore the pain and don't fear death. This would increase desireability in groups/raids and would also add something that casters can benefit from.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There is no new Warcry 66+&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Throwing - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Some improvements are being considered as part of round #1 of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Throwing is currently the weakest form of damage for berserkers… its currently bugged as well.&amp;nbsp; From my understanding the proc rate on the Tainted Axe of hatred is supposed to be very high… sadly it isn’t.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Increase the BASE damage of Throwing&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Add a Quiver type of ammo slot bag..&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Remove component cost. It seems like the Dev crew has realized that taxing a class for using their basic abilities with money sinks is 'a bad thing(tm)'. (See removal of cleric's peridot cost from Symbol/Aego line). I don't think that we should suffer from these reagent costs as there is virtually no other source of readily available throwing items for us available.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We would like to see an Endless Quiver AA. Carrying around components and stacks of axes is very tedious, especially when you need to summon tons of axes for a raid fight.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Remove the casting time on axe summons. If we run out of axes mid-fight and need to summon new Axes we have to pause for 2 seconds on every summon. This lowers our DPS considereably. For comparison, a Ranger (without Endless Quiver) that carries his Fletching Kit and components around only has to click the combine button which doesn't take any time to cast or interrupts his combat.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The way that throwing currently works we can't have a stat item in Range slot and still be able to use throwing (unless the stat item of course is a throwing axe). With Archery, this problem is solved through bows which have decent stats. Allow us to throw items from ammo slot and kep a stat item range slot or add bow equivalent items for throwing (throwing gloves, magical sharpening stones, etc.)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Reconsider the range of throwing weapons. The best one is currently 175 which is not enough to 'dodge' from AEs in raid encounters. Therefore, throwing isn't even a viable alternative to meleeing in those situations. Please extend it beyond 200 - any lvl 55+ bow has a range of 175 and can be easily extended beyond 200 with cheap arrows (even mage summoned arrows)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Abilities - &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN red; ?Century Gothic?? **SMURF**?COLOR: mso-bidi-font-family:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We need a Stun and SNARE on different timers.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Stun Endurance cost needs to be lowered - &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is being considered as part of round #1 of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Snare should scale with each new rank (level 8 snare is as good at the level 65 one)&amp;nbsp; I suggest 1 minute, 2 minute, 3 minute set times on each.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Jolt needs its own timer as well…&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Endurance Regen -&lt;FONT color=#9933ff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Innate Endurance regen doesn't improve from 65 to 70 while all abilities become more costly in endurance cost.&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Berserkers suffer the most from endurance use, so there must be a way for us to get better endurance return… I suggest Flowing Thought for endurance&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;No Raid Utility - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We need something besides medicore dps to help our group/raid.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ideas tossed around are more combat abilities, innate group bonuses, AE Warcrys, and AE abilities that improve the raid. (Maybe + Accuracy or + Strikethrough).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We should be able to provide such skills most of the time, NOT like current Warcry only once every 30 minutes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We need something class defining that gives us an attractive niche to fill.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Improved DPS -&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;DPS evaluation for all classes has begun and will be the focus of part #2 of the class Re-Envision process&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I have done much research into the damage comparisons of Rogues, Warriors, Monks, and Berserkers; I have found that Rogues do the most DPS by a large margin… Berserkers do about 60% of what a rogue can do.&amp;nbsp; That means that 1 rogue is worth 2 berserkers, since we have no other utility to offer outside of our DPS.&amp;nbsp; My suggestion is to somehow improve our DPS to at least 80% of a rogue&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;By limiting berserkers to 2handed weapons only, you have extremely limited our paths of progression.&amp;nbsp; The quality of 2handers coming out of GoD is also very bad…. They are either too fast, or have no AC.&amp;nbsp; You introduced a lot of 2handers with dumb procs like Guard 3… WHY!?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;OL&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Improve Overall Melee performance &lt;SPAN&gt;–&lt;FONT color=#9933ff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This will most likely be considered as part of&amp;nbsp;part #2 of&amp;nbsp;the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Berserkers aren't really happy with their general melee performance yet and feel that we need something to push us ahead of the baseline warriors to make us a true dps class. Here are some ideas for improvements:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Give us a special damage table like monks or innate bonuses like damage modifiers&amp;nbsp;(analog to Warriors mitigation bonus), higher innate crit rates than other classes, etc. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Add Specialize 2handed slash , blunt and piercing: a skill that gives a small delay reduction like the 100 hands effect before ordinary haste applies and increases accuracy. As with the caster specialization you can only choose one weapontype to master.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;An innate bane to our weapons by type, i.e. 2hb +3 undead 2hs +3 humanoid 2hp +2 whatever&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2H weapons generally have lower stats than equal level 1h-1h or 1h-shield combos. Other classes can choose which combination they want to use in order optimize their performance accordingly to the situation but Berserkers are stuck with 2h Weapons no matter what. Either increase the overall stats on 2H weapons or give Berserkers a bonus on 2H weapons (A code similar to the Recommended Level code could be used that would grant Berserkers additional 25 - 50% of the weapon stats. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Frenzy &lt;SPAN&gt;–&lt;FONT color=#9933ff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We would like to see a higher minimum damage value added for Frenzy (pre-AAs). Currently we can Frenzy for 3 points of damage. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The scaleability of this scale is very poor. It skill caps out very early at 200 and it is completely weapon independent. So between the time where a Berserker maxes out the skill (around lvl 40) and gets his Frenzy improvement AAs (usually around lvl 65 or even later). The skill is stagnant is pretty much stagnant.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reevaluate the Endurance Cost of our Abilities.&amp;nbsp;– &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is being considered as part of round #1 of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The cost of some of the abilities (especially the 3rd rank and above) as well as all Warcries seem to be a bit over the top. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Itemization -&lt;FONT color=#9933ff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is still in progress&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;BER only Weapons - Add some BER only weapons similar to other classes. From Ssra to elemental pet weapon to Time level.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There is simply not enough class specific armor or weapons for the berserker as he progresses through the previous content.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Create a style of Berserker only type of weapons, perhaps extremely heavy weapons, or specialized throwing weapons.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Warcry Improvements –&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The effectiveness of Warcries is still nothing that makes people really *want* Berserkers. It has too little effect on the damage output of the group.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Recast time is too long for the impact of the effect.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Increase the range of Warcry. Especially in raid situations the groupmembers may spread out further than the current 60 range and will therefore miss the effect.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Add a "purify" attribute to Warcries that remove detrimental effects on the group/raid or turn them off for the duration of the Warcry.

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There is no new Warcry 66+&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Throwing - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Some improvements are being considered as part of round #1 of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Increase the BASE damage of Throwing&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Add a Quiver type of ammo slot bag..&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Remove component cost. It seems like the Dev crew has realized that taxing a class for using their basic abilities with money sinks is 'a bad thing(tm)'.

&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Jolt needs its own timer as well…&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;OL&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Improve Overall Melee performance &lt;SPAN&gt;–&lt;FONT color=#9933ff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Berserkers aren't really happy with their general melee performance yet and feel that we need something to push us ahead of the baseline warriors to make us a true dps class. Here are some ideas for improvements:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Give us a special damage table like monks or innate bonuses like damage modifiers&amp;nbsp;(analog to Warriors mitigation bonus), higher innate crit rates than other classes, etc. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Add Specialize 2handed slash , blunt and piercing: a skill that gives a small delay reduction like the 100 hands effect before ordinary haste applies and increases accuracy. As with the caster specialization you can only choose one weapontype to master.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;An innate bane to our weapons by type, i.e. 2hb +3 undead 2hs +3 humanoid 2hp +2 whatever&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2H weapons generally have lower stats than equal level 1h-1h or 1h-shield combos. Other classes can choose which combination they want to use in order optimize their performance accordingly to the situation but Berserkers are stuck with 2h Weapons no matter what. Either increase the overall stats on 2H weapons or give Berserkers a bonus on 2H weapons (A code similar to the Recommended Level code could be used that would grant Berserkers additional 25 - 50% of the weapon stats. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Frenzy &lt;SPAN&gt;–&lt;FONT color=#9933ff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We would like to see a higher minimum damage value added for Frenzy (pre-AAs). Currently we can Frenzy for 3 points of damage. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The scaleability of this scale is very poor. It skill caps out very early at 200 and it is completely weapon independent. So between the time where a Berserker maxes out the skill (around lvl 40) and gets his Frenzy improvement AAs (usually around lvl 65 or even later). The skill is stagnant is pretty much stagnant.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reevaluate the Endurance Cost of our Abilities.&amp;nbsp;– &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The cost of some of the abilities (especially the 3rd rank and above) as well as all Warcries seem to be a bit over the top. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Itemization -&lt;FONT color=#9933ff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is still in progress&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;BER only Weapons - Add some BER only weapons similar to other classes. From Ssra to elemental pet weapon to Time level.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There is simply not enough class specific armor or weapons for the berserker as he progresses through the previous content.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Create a style of Berserker only type of weapons, perhaps extremely heavy weapons, or specialized throwing weapons.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Warcry Improvements –&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The effectiveness of Warcries is still nothing that makes people really *want* Berserkers. It has too little effect on the damage output of the group.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Recast time is too long for the impact of the effect.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Increase the range of Warcry. Especially in raid situations the groupmembers may spread out further than the current 60 range and will therefore miss the effect.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Add a "purify" attribute to Warcries that remove detrimental effects on the group/raid or turn them off for the duration of the Warcry. The idea is that the Warcry puts our friends in such an agitated state that they ignore the pain and don't fear death. This would increase desireability in groups/raids and would also add something that casters can benefit from.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There is no new Warcry 66+&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Throwing - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Throwing is currently the weakest form of damage for berserkers… its currently bugged as well.&amp;nbsp; From my understanding the proc rate on the Tainted Axe of hatred is supposed to be very high… sadly it isn’t.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Increase the BASE damage of Throwing&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Add a Quiver type of ammo slot bag..&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Remove component cost. It seems like the Dev crew has realized that taxing a class for using their basic abilities with money sinks is 'a bad thing(tm)'. (See removal of cleric's peridot cost from Symbol/Aego line). I don't think that we should suffer from these reagent costs as there is virtually no other source of readily available throwing items for us available.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We would like to see an Endless Quiver AA. Carrying around components and stacks of axes is very tedious, especially when you need to summon tons of axes for a raid fight.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Remove the casting time on axe summons. If we run out of axes mid-fight and need to summon new Axes we have to pause for 2 seconds on every summon. This lowers our DPS considereably. For comparison, a Ranger (without Endless Quiver) that carries his Fletching Kit and components around only has to click the combine button which doesn't take any time to cast or interrupts his combat.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The way that throwing currently works we can't have a stat item in Range slot and still be able to use throwing (unless the stat item of course is a throwing axe). With Archery, this problem is solved through bows which have decent stats. Allow us to throw items from ammo slot and kep a stat item range slot or add bow equivalent items for throwing (throwing gloves, magical sharpening stones, etc.)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Reconsider the range of throwing weapons. The best one is currently 175 which is not enough to 'dodge' from AEs in raid encounters. Therefore, throwing isn't even a viable alternative to meleeing in those situations. Please extend it beyond 200 - any lvl 55+ bow has a range of 175 and can be easily extended beyond 200 with cheap arrows (even mage summoned arrows)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Abilities - &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN ?Century Gothic?? red; mso-bidi-font-family: **SMURF**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We need a Stun and SNARE on different timers.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Stun Endurance cost needs to be lowered&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Snare should scale with each new rank (level 8 snare is as good at the level 65 one)&amp;nbsp; I suggest 1 minute, 2 minute, 3 minute set times on each.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Jolt needs its own timer as well…&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Endurance Regen -&lt;FONT color=#9933ff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Innate Endurance regen doesn't improve from 65 to 70 while all abilities become more costly in endurance cost.&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Berserkers suffer the most from endurance use, so there must be a way for us to get better endurance return… I suggest Flowing Thought for endurance&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;No Raid Utility - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We need something besides medicore dps to help our group/raid.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ideas tossed around are more combat abilities, innate group bonuses, AE Warcrys, and AE abilities that improve the raid. (Maybe + Accuracy or + Strikethrough).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We should be able to provide such skills most of the time, NOT like current Warcry only once every 30 minutes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We need something class defining that gives us an attractive niche to fill.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Improved DPS -&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; - &lt;FONT size=2&gt;DPS for all classes to be evaluated with the class Re-Envision process&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I have done much research into the damage comparisons of Rogues, Warriors, Monks, and Berserkers; I have found that Rogues do the most DPS by a large margin… Berserkers do about 60% of what a rogue can do.&amp;nbsp; That means that 1 rogue is worth 2 berserkers, since we have no other utility to offer outside of our DPS.&amp;nbsp; My suggestion is to somehow improve our DPS to at least 80% of a rogue&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;By limiting berserkers to 2handed weapons only, you have extremely limited our paths of progression.&amp;nbsp; The quality of 2handers coming out of GoD is also very bad…. They are either too fast, or have no AC.&amp;nbsp; You introduced a lot of 2handers with dumb procs like Guard 3… WHY!?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&#xD;

&lt;LI&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Our piercing cap should be equal to our 2hb and 2hs cap. (252 at lvl 65 and 270 at lvl 70 - Currently it is 240 at lvl 65 and 260 at lvl 70)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &#xD;

&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Add a Quiver type of ammo slot bag..&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Remove component cost. It seems like the Dev crew has realized that taxing a class for using their basic abilities with money sinks is 'a bad thing(tm)'.

Therefore, throwing isn't even a viable alternative to meleeing in those situations. Please extend it beyond 200 - any lvl 55+ bow has a range of 175 and can be easily extended beyond 200 with cheap arrows (even mage summoned arrows)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ideas tossed around are more combat abilities, innate group bonuses, AE Warcrys, and AE abilities that improve the raid. (Maybe + Accuracy or + Strikethrough).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We should be able to provide such skills most of the time, NOT like current Warcry only once every 30 minutes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;

&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I have done much research into the damage comparisons of Rogues, Warriors, Monks, and Berserkers; I have found that Rogues do the most DPS by a large margin… Berserkers do about 60% of what a rogue can do.&amp;nbsp; That means that 1 rogue is worth 2 berserkers, since we have no other utility to offer outside of our DPS.&amp;nbsp; My suggestion is to somehow improve our DPS to at least 80% of a rogue&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;By limiting berserkers to 2handed weapons only, you have extremely limited our paths of progression.&amp;nbsp; The quality of 2handers coming out of GoD is also very bad….

&lt;OL&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Improve Overall Melee performance &lt;SPAN&gt;–&lt;FONT color=#9933ff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Berserkers aren't really happy with their general melee performance yet and feel that we need something to push us ahead of the baseline warriors to make us a true dps class. Here are some ideas for improvements: &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Our piercing cap should be equal to our 2hb and 2hs cap. (252 at lvl 65 and 270 at lvl 70 - Currently it is 240 at lvl 65 and 260 at lvl 70)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Give us a special damage table like monks or innate bonuses like damage modifiers&amp;nbsp;(analog to Warriors mitigation bonus), higher innate crit rates than other classes, etc. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Add Specialize 2handed slash , blunt and piercing: a skill that gives a small delay reduction like the 100 hands effect before ordinary haste applies and increases accuracy. As with the caster specialization you can only choose one weapontype to master.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;An innate bane to our weapons by type, i.e. 2hb +3 undead 2hs +3 humanoid 2hp +2 whatever&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2H weapons generally have lower stats than equal level 1h-1h or 1h-shield combos. Other classes can choose which combination they want to use in order optimize their performance accordingly to the situation but Berserkers are stuck with 2h Weapons no matter what. Either increase the overall stats on 2H weapons or give Berserkers a bonus on 2H weapons (A code similar to the Recommended Level code could be used that would grant Berserkers additional 25 - 50% of the weapon stats. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Frenzy &lt;SPAN&gt;–&lt;FONT color=#9933ff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We would like to see a higher minimum damage value added for Frenzy (pre-AAs). Currently we can Frenzy for 3 points of damage. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The scaleability of this scale is very poor. It skill caps out very early at 200 and it is completely weapon independent. So between the time where a Berserker maxes out the skill (around lvl 40) and gets his Frenzy improvement AAs (usually around lvl 65 or even later). The skill is stagnant is pretty much stagnant.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reevaluate the Endurance Cost of our Abilities.&amp;nbsp;– &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The cost of some of the abilities (especially the 3rd rank and above) as well as all Warcries seem to be a bit over the top. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Itemization -&lt;FONT color=#9933ff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is still in progress&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;BER only Weapons - Add some BER only weapons similar to other classes. From Ssra to elemental pet weapon to Time level.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There is simply not enough class specific armor or weapons for the berserker as he progresses through the previous content.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Create a style of Berserker only type of weapons, perhaps extremely heavy weapons, or specialized throwing weapons.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Warcry Improvements –&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The effectiveness of Warcries is still nothing that makes people really *want* Berserkers. It has too little effect on the damage output of the group.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Add a MGB skill for Warcry or a new tomes that are MGB'able. (See Raid utitility) - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;There are no plans for a MGB ability for berserkers.&amp;nbsp; Warcry is meant to be single group only.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Recast time is too long for the impact of the effect.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Increase the range of Warcry. Especially in raid situations the groupmembers may spread out further than the current 60 range and will therefore miss the effect.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Add a "purify" attribute to Warcries that remove detrimental effects on the group/raid or turn them off for the duration of the Warcry. The idea is that the Warcry puts our friends in such an agitated state that they ignore the pain and don't fear death. This would increase desireability in groups/raids and would also add something that casters can benefit from.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There is no new Warcry 66+&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Throwing - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Throwing is currently the weakest form of damage for berserkers… its currently bugged as well.&amp;nbsp; From my understanding the proc rate on the Tainted Axe of hatred is supposed to be very high… sadly it isn’t.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Increase the BASE damage of Throwing&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Add a Quiver type of ammo slot bag..&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Remove component cost. It seems like the Dev crew has realized that taxing a class for using their basic abilities with money sinks is 'a bad thing(tm)'. (See removal of cleric's peridot cost from Symbol/Aego line). I don't think that we should suffer from these reagent costs as there is virtually no other source of readily available throwing items for us available.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We would like to see an Endless Quiver AA. Carrying around components and stacks of axes is very tedious, especially when you need to summon tons of axes for a raid fight.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Remove the casting time on axe summons. If we run out of axes mid-fight and need to summon new Axes we have to pause for 2 seconds on every summon. This lowers our DPS considereably. For comparison, a Ranger (without Endless Quiver) that carries his Fletching Kit and components around only has to click the combine button which doesn't take any time to cast or interrupts his combat.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The way that throwing currently works we can't have a stat item in Range slot and still be able to use throwing (unless the stat item of course is a throwing axe). With Archery, this problem is solved through bows which have decent stats. Allow us to throw items from ammo slot and kep a stat item range slot or add bow equivalent items for throwing (throwing gloves, magical sharpening stones, etc.)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Reconsider the range of throwing weapons. The best one is currently 175 which is not enough to 'dodge' from AEs in raid encounters. Therefore, throwing isn't even a viable alternative to meleeing in those situations. Please extend it beyond 200 - any lvl 55+ bow has a range of 175 and can be easily extended beyond 200 with cheap arrows (even mage summoned arrows)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Abilities - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This item had additions added to it with the 11/05 update, we currently do not have any new development feedback on this issue.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;

&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2H weapons generally have lower stats than equal level 1h-1h or 1h-shield combos. Other classes can choose which combination they want to use in order optimize their performance accordingly to the situation but Berserkers are stuck with 2h Weapons no matter what. Either increase the overall stats on 2H weapons or give Berserkers a bonus on 2H weapons (A code similar to the Recommended Level code could be used that would grant Berserkers additional 25 - 50% of the weapon stats. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Frenzy &lt;SPAN&gt;–&lt;FONT color=#9933ff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated - Reworded version&amp;nbsp; was added with the 11/05 update, we currently do not have any new development feedback on this issue.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We would like to see a higher minimum damage value added for Frenzy (pre-AAs). Currently we can Frenzy for 3 points of damage. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The scaleability of this scale is very poor. It skill caps out very early at 200 and it is completely weapon independent. So between the time where a Berserker maxes out the skill (around lvl 40) and gets his Frenzy improvement AAs (usually around lvl 65 or even later). The skill is stagnant is pretty much stagnant.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reevaluate the Endurance Cost of our Abilities.&amp;nbsp;– &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is a new item that was added with the 11/05 update, we currently do not have any development feedback on this issue.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The cost of some of the abilities (especially the 3rd rank and above) as well as all Warcries seem to be a bit over the top. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Itemization -&lt;FONT color=#9933ff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is still in progress&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;BER only Weapons - Add some BER only weapons similar to other classes. From Ssra to elemental pet weapon to Time level.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There is simply not enough class specific armor or weapons for the berserker as he progresses through the previous content.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Create a style of Berserker only type of weapons, perhaps extremely heavy weapons, or specialized throwing weapons.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Warcry Improvements –&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The effectiveness of Warcries is still nothing that makes people really *want* Berserkers. It has too little effect on the damage output of the group.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Add a MGB skill for Warcry or a new tomes that are MGB'able. (See Raid utitility) - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;There are no plans for a MGB ability for berserkers.&amp;nbsp; Warcry is meant to be single group only.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Recast time is too long for the impact of the effect.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Increase the range of Warcry. Especially in raid situations the groupmembers may spread out further than the current 60 range and will therefore miss the effect.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Add a "purify" attribute to Warcries that remove detrimental effects on the group/raid or turn them off for the duration of the Warcry. The idea is that the Warcry puts our friends in such an agitated state that they ignore the pain and don't fear death. This would increase desireability in groups/raids and would also add something that casters can benefit from.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There is no new Warcry 66+&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Throwing - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated - This item had additions added to it with the 11/05 update, we currently do not have any new development feedback on this issue.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Throwing is currently the weakest form of damage for berserkers… its currently bugged as well.&amp;nbsp; From my understanding the proc rate on the Tainted Axe of hatred is supposed to be very high… sadly it isn’t.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Increase the BASE damage of Throwing&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Add a Quiver type of ammo slot bag..&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Remove component cost. It seems like the Dev crew has realized that taxing a class for using their basic abilities with money sinks is 'a bad thing(tm)'. (See removal of cleric's peridot cost from Symbol/Aego line). I don't think that we should suffer from these reagent costs as there is virtually no other source of readily available throwing items for us available.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We would like to see an Endless Quiver AA. Carrying around components and stacks of axes is very tedious, especially when you need to summon tons of axes for a raid fight.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Remove the casting time on axe summons. If we run out of axes mid-fight and need to summon new Axes we have to pause for 2 seconds on every summon. This lowers our DPS considereably. For comparison, a Ranger (without Endless Quiver) that carries his Fletching Kit and components around only has to click the combine button which doesn't take any time to cast or interrupts his combat.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Don't forget to consider throwing on the upcoming archery-autofire function. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This is on live servers as of the 12/15 update&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The way that throwing currently works we can't have a stat item in Range slot and still be able to use throwing (unless the stat item of course is a throwing axe). With Archery, this problem is solved through bows which have decent stats. Allow us to throw items from ammo slot and kep a stat item range slot or add bow equivalent items for throwing (throwing gloves, magical sharpening stones, etc.)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Reconsider the range of throwing weapons. The best one is currently 175 which is not enough to 'dodge' from AEs in raid encounters. Therefore, throwing isn't even a viable alternative to meleeing in those situations. Please extend it beyond 200 - any lvl 55+ bow has a range of 175 and can be easily extended beyond 200 with cheap arrows (even mage summoned arrows)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Abilities - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This item had additions added to it with the 11/05 update, we currently do not have any new development feedback on this issue.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The level 67 snare is random duration. All other snares are fixed duration.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Frenzy and Kick are on same timers, separate them.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We need a Stun and SNARE on different timers.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Stun Endurance cost needs to be lowered&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Snare should scale with each new rank (level 8 snare is as good at the level 65 one)&amp;nbsp; I suggest 1 minute, 2 minute, 3 minute set times on each.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Jolt needs its own timer as well…&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Endurance Regen -&lt;FONT color=#9933ff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated, Reworded version&amp;nbsp; was added with the 11/05 update, we currently do not have any new development feedback on this issue.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Innate Endurance regen doesn't improve from 65 to 70 while all abilities become more costly in endurance cost.&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Berserkers suffer the most from endurance use, so there must be a way for us to get better endurance return… I suggest Flowing Thought for endurance&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;No Raid Utility - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated, Reworded version&amp;nbsp; was added with the 11/05 update, we currently do not have any new development feedback on this issue.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We need something besides medicore dps to help our group/raid.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ideas tossed around are more combat abilities, innate group bonuses, AE Warcrys, and AE abilities that improve the raid. (Maybe + Accuracy or + Strikethrough).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We should be able to provide such skills most of the time, NOT like current Warcry only once every 30 minutes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We need something class defining that gives us an attractive niche to fill.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Improved DPS -&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; - &lt;FONT size=2&gt;DPS for all classes to be&amp;nbsp;re-evaluated in the future&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I have done much research into the damage comparisons of Rogues, Warriors, Monks, and Berserkers; I have found that Rogues do the most DPS by a large margin… Berserkers do about 60% of what a rogue can do.&amp;nbsp; That means that 1 rogue is worth 2 berserkers, since we have no other utility to offer outside of our DPS.&amp;nbsp; My suggestion is to somehow improve our DPS to at least 80% of a rogue&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;By limiting berserkers to 2handed weapons only, you have extremely limited our paths of progression.&amp;nbsp; The quality of 2handers coming out of GoD is also very bad…. They are either too fast, or have no AC.&amp;nbsp; You introduced a lot of 2handers with dumb procs like Guard 3… WHY!?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Improve Overall Melee performance &lt;SPAN&gt;–&lt;FONT color=#9933ff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is a new item that was added with the 11/05 update, we currently do not have any development feedback on this issue.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Berserkers aren't really happy with their general melee performance yet and feel that we need something to push us ahead of the baseline warriors to make us a true dps class. Here are some ideas for improvements: &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Our piercing cap should be equal to our 2hb and 2hs cap. (252 at lvl 65 and 270 at lvl 70 - Currently it is 240 at lvl 65 and 260 at lvl 70)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Give us a special damage table like monks or innate bonuses like damage modifiers&amp;nbsp;(analog to Warriors mitigation bonus), higher innate crit rates than other classes, etc. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Add Specialize 2handed slash , blunt and piercing: a skill that gives a small delay reduction like the 100 hands effect before ordinary haste applies and increases accuracy. As with the caster specialization you can only choose one weapontype to master.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;An innate bane to our weapons by type, i.e. 2hb +3 undead 2hs +3 humanoid 2hp +2 whatever&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2H weapons generally have lower stats than equal level 1h-1h or 1h-shield combos.

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ideas tossed around are more combat abilities, innate group bonuses, AE Warcrys, and AE abilities that improve the raid. (Maybe + Accuracy or + Strikethrough).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We should be able to provide such skills most of the time, NOT like current Warcry only once every 30 minutes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;

&lt;OL&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Improve Overall Melee performance &lt;SPAN&gt;–&lt;FONT color=#9933ff&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is a new item that was added with the 11/05 update, we currently do not have any development feedback on this issue.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Berserkers aren't really happy with their general melee performance yet and feel that we need something to push us ahead of the baseline warriors to make us a true dps class. Here are some ideas for improvements:&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Our piercing cap should be equal to our 2hb and 2hs cap. (252 at lvl 65 and 270 at lvl 70 - Currently it is 240 at lvl 65 and 260 at lvl 70)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Give us a special damage table like monks or innate bonuses like damage modifiers&amp;nbsp;(analog to Warriors mitigation bonus), higher innate crit rates than other classes, etc.&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Add Specialize 2handed slash , blunt and piercing: a skill that gives a small delay reduction like the 100 hands effect before ordinary haste applies and increases accuracy. As with the caster specialization you can only choose one weapontype to master.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;An innate bane to our weapons by type, i.e. 2hb +3 undead 2hs +3 humanoid 2hp +2 whatever&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2H weapons generally have lower stats than equal level 1h-1h or 1h-shield combos. Other classes can choose which combination they want to use in order optimize their performance accordingly to the situation but Berserkers are stuck with 2h Weapons no matter what. Either increase the overall stats on 2H weapons or give Berserkers a bonus on 2H weapons (A code similar to the Recommended Level code could be used that would grant Berserkers additional 25 - 50% of the weapon stats. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Frenzy &lt;SPAN&gt;–&lt;FONT color=#9933ff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated - Reworded version&amp;nbsp; was added with the 11/05 update, we currently do not have any new development feedback on this issue.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We would like to see a higher minimum damage value added for Frenzy (pre-AAs). Currently we can Frenzy for 3 points of damage. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The scaleability of this scale is very poor. It skill caps out very early at 200 and it is completely weapon independent. So between the time where a Berserker maxes out the skill (around lvl 40) and gets his Frenzy improvement AAs (usually around lvl 65 or even later). The skill is stagnant is pretty much stagnant.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reevaluate the Endurance Cost of our Abilities.&amp;nbsp;– &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is a new item that was added with the 11/05 update, we currently do not have any development feedback on this issue.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The cost of some of the abilities (especially the 3rd rank and above) as well as all Warcries seem to be a bit over the top. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Itemization -&lt;FONT color=#9933ff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is still in progress&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;BER only Weapons - Add some BER only weapons similar to other classes. From Ssra to elemental pet weapon to Time level.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There is simply not enough class specific armor or weapons for the berserker as he progresses through the previous content.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Create a style of Berserker only type of weapons, perhaps extremely heavy weapons, or specialized throwing weapons.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Warcry Improvements –&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being discussed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The effectiveness of Warcries is still nothing that makes people really *want* Berserkers. It has too little effect on the damage output of the group.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Add a MGB skill for Warcry or a new tomes that are MGB'able. (See Raid utitility) - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;There are no plans for a MGB ability for berserkers.&amp;nbsp; Warcry is meant to be single group only.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Recast time is too long for the impact of the effect.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Increase the range of Warcry. Especially in raid situations the groupmembers may spread out further than the current 60 range and will therefore miss the effect.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Add a "purify" attribute to Warcries that remove detrimental effects on the group/raid or turn them off for the duration of the Warcry. The idea is that the Warcry puts our friends in such an agitated state that they ignore the pain and don't fear death. This would increase desireability in groups/raids and would also add something that casters can benefit from.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There is no new Warcry 66+&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Throwing - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated - This item had additions added to it with the 11/05 update, we currently do not have any new development feedback on this issue.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Throwing is currently the weakest form of damage for berserkers… its currently bugged as well.&amp;nbsp; From my understanding the proc rate on the Tainted Axe of hatred is supposed to be very high… sadly it isn’t.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Increase the BASE damage of Throwing&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Add a Quiver type of ammo slot bag..&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Remove component cost. It seems like the Dev crew has realized that taxing a class for using their basic abilities with money sinks is 'a bad thing(tm)'. (See removal of cleric's peridot cost from Symbol/Aego line). I don't think that we should suffer from these reagent costs as there is virtually no other source of readily available throwing items for us available.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We would like to see an Endless Quiver AA. Carrying around components and stacks of axes is very tedious, especially when you need to summon tons of axes for a raid fight.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Remove the casting time on axe summons. If we run out of axes mid-fight and need to summon new Axes we have to pause for 2 seconds on every summon. This lowers our DPS considereably. For comparison, a Ranger (without Endless Quiver) that carries his Fletching Kit and components around only has to click the combine button which doesn't take any time to cast or interrupts his combat.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Don't forget to consider throwing on the upcoming archery-autofire function. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This is currently how Auto-Fire works&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The way that throwing currently works we can't have a stat item in Range slot and still be able to use throwing (unless the stat item of course is a throwing axe). With Archery, this problem is solved through bows which have decent stats. Allow us to throw items from ammo slot and kep a stat item range slot or add bow equivalent items for throwing (throwing gloves, magical sharpening stones, etc.)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Reconsider the range of throwing weapons. The best one is currently 175 which is not enough to 'dodge' from AEs in raid encounters. Therefore, throwing isn't even a viable alternative to meleeing in those situations.

&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;An innate bane to our weapons by type, i.e. 2hb +3 undead 2hs +3 humanoid 2hp +2 whatever&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2H weapons generally have lower stats than equal level 1h-1h or 1h-shield combos. Other classes can choose which combination they want to use in order optimize their performance accordingly to the situation but Berserkers are stuck with 2h Weapons no matter what. Either increase the overall stats on 2H weapons or give Berserkers a bonus on 2H weapons (A code similar to the Recommended Level code could be used that would grant Berserkers additional 25 - 50% of the weapon stats. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Frenzy &lt;SPAN&gt;–&lt;FONT color=#9933ff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated - reworded version passed along&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We would like to see a higher minimum damage value added for Frenzy (pre-AAs). Currently we can Frenzy for 3 points of damage. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The scaleability of this scale is very poor. It skill caps out very early at 200 and it is completely weapon independent. So between the time where a Berserker maxes out the skill (around lvl 40) and gets his Frenzy improvement AAs (usually around lvl 65 or even later). The skill is stagnant is pretty much stagnant.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reevaluate the Endurance Cost of our Abilities.&amp;nbsp;– &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(NEW)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The cost of some of the abilities (especially the 3rd rank and above) as well as all Warcries seem to be a bit over the top. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Itemization -&lt;FONT color=#9933ff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;This is still in progress&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;BER only Weapons - Add some BER only weapons similar to other classes. From Ssra to elemental pet weapon to Time level.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There is simply not enough class specific armor or weapons for the berserker as he progresses through the previous content.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Create a style of Berserker only type of weapons, perhaps extremely heavy weapons, or specialized throwing weapons.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Warcry Improvements –&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(NEW)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The effectiveness of Warcries is still nothing that makes people really *want* Berserkers. It has too little effect on the damage output of the group.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Add a MGB skill for Warcry or a new tomes that are MGB'able. (See Raid utitility)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Recast time is too long for the impact of the effect.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Increase the range of Warcry. Especially in raid situations the groupmembers may spread out further than the current 60 range and will therefore miss the effect.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Add a "purify" attribute to Warcries that remove detrimental effects on the group/raid or turn them off for the duration of the Warcry. The idea is that the Warcry puts our friends in such an agitated state that they ignore the pain and don't fear death. This would increase desireability in groups/raids and would also add something that casters can benefit from.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There is no new Warcry 66+&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Throwing - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated additions to this item have been passed along&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Throwing is currently the weakest form of damage for berserkers… its currently bugged as well.&amp;nbsp; From my understanding the proc rate on the Tainted Axe of hatred is supposed to be very high… sadly it isn’t.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Increase the BASE damage of Throwing&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Add a Quiver type of ammo slot bag..&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Remove component cost. It seems like the Dev crew has realized that taxing a class for using their basic abilities with money sinks is 'a bad thing(tm)'. (See removal of cleric's peridot cost from Symbol/Aego line). I don't think that we should suffer from these reagent costs as there is virtually no other source of readily available throwing items for us available.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We would like to see an Endless Quiver AA. Carrying around components and stacks of axes is very tedious, especially when you need to summon tons of axes for a raid fight.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Remove the casting time on axe summons. If we run out of axes mid-fight and need to summon new Axes we have to pause for 2 seconds on every summon. This lowers our DPS considereably. For comparison, a Ranger (without Endless Quiver) that carries his Fletching Kit and components around only has to click the combine button which doesn't take any time to cast or interrupts his combat.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Don't forget to consider throwing on the upcoming archery-autofire function. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This is currently how Auto-Fire works&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The way that throwing currently works we can't have a stat item in Range slot and still be able to use throwing (unless the stat item of course is a throwing axe). With Archery, this problem is solved through bows which have decent stats. Allow us to throw items from ammo slot and kep a stat item range slot or add bow equivalent items for throwing (throwing gloves, magical sharpening stones, etc.)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Abilities - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Curently being discussed additions to the item have been passed along&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The level 67 snare is random duration. All other snares are fixed duration.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Frenzy and Kick are on same timers, separate them.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We need a Stun and SNARE on different timers.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Stun Endurance cost needs to be lowered&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Snare should scale with each new rank (level 8 snare is as good at the level 65 one)&amp;nbsp; I suggest 1 minute, 2 minute, 3 minute set times on each.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Jolt needs its own timer as well…&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Endurance Regen -&lt;FONT color=#9933ff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated, reworded and added information has been passed along&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Innate Endurance regen doesn't improve from 65 to 70 while all abilities become more costly in endurance cost.&lt;/SPAN&gt; &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Berserkers suffer the most from endurance use, so there must be a way for us to get better endurance return… I suggest Flowing Thought for endurance&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;No Raid Utility - &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated, reworded version has been passed along&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We need something besides medicore dps to help our group/raid.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ideas tossed around are more combat abilities, innate group bonuses, AE Warcrys, and AE abilities that improve the raid. (Maybe + Accuracy or + Strikethrough).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We should be able to provide such skills most of the time, NOT like current Warcry only once every 30 minutes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We need something class defining that gives us an attractive niche to fill.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Improved DPS -&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;Currently being evaluated&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; - &lt;FONT size=2&gt;DPS for all classes to be&amp;nbsp;re-evaluated in the future&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I have done much research into the damage comparisons of Rogues, Warriors, Monks, and Berserkers; I have found that Rogues do the most DPS by a large margin… Berserkers do about 60% of what a rogue can do.&amp;nbsp; That means that 1 rogue is worth 2 berserkers, since we have no other utility to offer outside of our DPS.&amp;nbsp; My suggestion is to somehow improve our DPS to at least 80% of a rogue&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;By limiting berserkers to 2handed weapons only, you have extremely limited our paths of progression.&amp;nbsp; The quality of 2handers coming out of GoD is also very bad…. They are either too fast, or have no AC.&amp;nbsp; You introduced a lot of 2handers with dumb procs like Guard 3… WHY!?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
