    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I've selected a set of zones for the new hot zones. I'll need to run them by Maddoc and Rashere before anything else happens but I had fun picking them. I selected zones that I had fun in when I was leveling up. I think it's a good mix.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>For the love of Norrath, please change the hot zones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have been asking for months.  The midgets have been in here a few times saying that they would be doing this...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hott zones are a great idea....but the current ones are old as hell.  Im so tired of fighting in TOFS and fighting for a good camp spot in EchoCaverns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even if you have to go back to the first set of zones you used.... please.  Set some new zones to become hottzones during the next patch. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=)</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Re: Skills not keeping up with levels&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Heh, the problem of skills not keeping up with levels when you move too quickly has existed since the first 4 bone chips or CB belts were turned in in Kaladim. I remember back in the day of the hybrid penalty, Troll SK had something like a 65% penalty due to all the factors they had working against them, but was it really a penalty? They spent more time at each level, so they had more time than anyone to max out their skills before advancing to the next level. Lots of halflings I knew back then greatly outpaced the penalized races in levels, but at level 20 couldn't kill a bixie because their skills were so feeble. Hot Zones and zones with huge innate ZEM bonuses are actually BAD. Sure you get levels fast, but you are useless for a long time because you can't score a hit or dodge a blow or you fizzle away an entire bar of mana because your skills have lagged.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PALUDAL CAVERNS MUST BE NERFED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I've seen this sentiment a few times in this thread so I've looked hard at the zone. Being a dungeon it's going to be easier to find things to kill versus an outdoor zone but the ZEM (Zone Experience Modifier) on that zone is currently &lt;STRONG&gt;well&lt;/STRONG&gt; below what you'll find in the hot zones (to the tune of 50% in some cases) Additionally the hot zones are designed for level 20 and up and Paludal tops out at around 25 if I recall correctly.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm told the ZEM for that zone was lowered previously (at one point it was pretty rediculously high) but the hitpoints of the mobs in the zone seem consistent with other parts of the game so it seems like the zone is a good zone but not in need of major reworking. In fact the average hitpoint level in Paludal is &lt;STRONG&gt;higher&lt;/STRONG&gt; than the zone I have picked out for the level 20 crowd.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I welcome any comments on this but unless there's an "I Win" button out there for Paludal I can't see there doesn't seem to be a real issue. I can't see any way that you wouldn't be better served hitting the new hotspots than Paludal when you hit the appropriate level ranges.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

Even if the ZEM is lower, I can grab a pile of mobs and let them die to a DS.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Thanks for the reply.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;While I would like to see levelling through the lower levels slowed down a bit, it seems that I am going against the tide.&amp;nbsp; I suppose in the EQ of today, rushing through the lower levels is "working as intended" so I shall cease and desist fighting a lost cause.&amp;nbsp; With that in mind....&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I really do hope that we can see people in the new hot-spots, if for no other reason than for a change of scenery when levelling an alt!&amp;nbsp; For the time I have spent in EQ, it has always been impossible to get a group of 15-25 in any area except Paludal--even if i tried to make the group myself.&amp;nbsp; The few times&amp;nbsp;I have done so, it was with much arm twisting of guild members or friends.&amp;nbsp; Even though they enjoyed the trips to other places, they did bemoan the amount of exp compared to what they would have had in Paludal.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now our biggest challenge will be to get the word out--there is a place to go better than Paludal!&amp;nbsp; If everyone will help, I am sure we can get a few folks to see a little bit more of the world as they level, and that will only help them become more knowledgeable players!&amp;nbsp; C'mon everyone--no more canned response to new players in PoK: "Where do I go...." "Paludal!" "Paludal" "Paludal&amp;gt;all!"&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As an act of good faith, I'll even change my sig!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I never go to Paludal and I never tell people to go there.&amp;nbsp; I hate it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What I hate isn't the experience or the zone itself, it's the trains and the kill stealing and the general bad behaviour of the people in it.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Hubby and I have haunted the hot zones but we have found others that we enjoyed, even if only for a few levels.&amp;nbsp; As young halflings we explored Runnyeye and found the Beholder's Maze as mentioned in a previous post.&amp;nbsp; It was generally totally empty but for people running through it to reach Karana, and we were getting very decent experience there.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For us, the fun is in exploring new places, not doing the same old thing over and over again.&amp;nbsp; I truly hope that the new hot zones are unique, places people rarely go to anymore and probably haven't thought of in many moons.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Raiina on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;01-04-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;04:02 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>Why not just randomize the hotspots. Put together a zone list for level ranges, have it pick x amount of zones per level range to be hotspots. It's very simple to code if the zones have a numerical id to them that follows a simple numerical range. It's as simple as: lowestZoneID + rand() % (highestZoneID - lowestZoneID) + lowestZoneID, if i remembered teh formula correctly.</description>

&lt;P&gt;Yeah, the Hole is a nice zone.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Can't wait to hear where the new hot spots are.&amp;nbsp; Not that I'm someone who follows the hot spots per se, still, the hot spots are the places where one usually has to go to find a group, so I am interested to know.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;C'mon guys--where are they?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>My thought is why change hot zone xp when xp in general could be modified?  From my experience in leveling up alts the xp is only good in one or two places at a time- even when fighting a creature of the same level and difficulty in another zone the xp dramatically differs.  There should be at minimum five places at a time that have roughly equivalent experience.  This goes for any level.  Bring experience earned to a relative equal amount in these low level zones and thats the long term solution.  Places with zone outs that are harder to access or require a key should yield the terrific amount of experience they once did, like Seb, HS, Kaesora.  Zones like PC need a slight adjustment to bring them in line, because the experience there is just flat insane while zones adjacent to it yield much lower rates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as increasing experience to LDON zones, this would be a patch solution to a much bigger solution that seems to be in the works.  Lets get 'em time and see what they come up with.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;While I appreciate and support your point of view, this seems to me to be off-topic in a thread about changing the hotspots.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anyways, I would like to add that I assume when you say &lt;EM&gt;There should be at minimum five places at a time that have roughly equivalent experience&lt;/EM&gt; that you mean &lt;EM&gt;There should be at minimum five&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;good exp&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;zones (high&amp;nbsp;ZEM)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;at a time &lt;STRONG&gt;per&amp;nbsp;level range&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;that have roughly equivalent experience&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Oops, one thing I forgot, doing this would help alleviate issues with exp-grind based boredom and camp disputes, however it will reduce the amount of players per exp zone and while that's&amp;nbsp;a good thing at level 51+, have you seen how many people are in paludal caverns at any given time on Povar? Generally less than six, unless a few are level 70 babysitters. Spreading out the already&amp;nbsp;small playerbase in the 1 to 50 range would be detrimental to groups and thus to player morale. Low level grouping prospects&amp;nbsp;are already dismal at best.&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Wow this thread took off LOL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since we are all recomending zones.... and a Dev was kind enough come by I have another question...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CAN LDON's be made hot zones?  Meaning do you all have the ability to do this?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And if so is there any chance that this could be done at some point? =)</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;I wish.&amp;nbsp; Was just thinking last night that a ZEM on LDoN dungeons would certainly be a nice thought - depending on the average level of your group the experience can be good or it can be really bad.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I want hotspots that encourage players to explore underutilized zones, especially those seem to have a lot of work put into them and which are large enough to support a big population of players:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
