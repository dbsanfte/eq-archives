    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It's been a long time since I've stepped foot on Norrath...but apparently SoE's Christmas gift this year is a drug addiction.  I've decided to come back...but in all honesty I'm not sure what I'll be coming back to. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How are Paladins as tanks in raid and cutting edge content these days?  Or, better yet...what IS cutting edge content these days?  When I left, OMM hadn't even been scratched, to give you an idea of time frame. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Has the Paladin role evolved at all since Omens?  I'm specifically referring to raid roles, as, at least as far as I can tell, I'm not having any problems functioning as an XP group tank.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fortunately enough, the guild that folded and caused my departure has decided to rebuild, and while our immediate goals will be finishing Inktu`ta where we ended, what do the new expansions offer us in terms of raiding?  Any advice or info you can share while I get my bearings again would be most appreciated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;The raid roll has not changed much.  If anything it has gone more to the curing side of the paladin, in my experience at least.  We can off tank well, even if not geared to the level of the top end of the guild.  We are a very capable class but I would say the raid roll has not changed much.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As for things that are a bit better, we got a soft cap change on out AC which helps on tanking.  And if you get it you have a very good slay undead tool to buy with AAs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Not much other than that but I know I missed some smaller things that others will probably fill in.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
