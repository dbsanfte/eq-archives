    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hello, and nice to meet you.  Forged in Fire is a newly emerging raiding guild.  We believe that it is possible for you to belong to a guild that raids high-end content while still maintaining a life outside of game.  With that said, Forged in Fire has a large portion of their members who are Anguish keyed.  Our raiding schedule is Monday through Thursday, 7:30PM EST til about 12:30EST.  Feel free to check out our website and see what we're all about.  You can find us at &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.forgedinfire.net/"&gt;www.ForgedinFire.net&lt;/a&gt;.  If you have any questions, send a tell in game to one of our officers:  Demoneque, Bravakor, Gazzaz, or Jhessail.  We'll be glad to answer any questions you may have.&lt;/div&gt;</description>
