<P><BR>If I remember correctly, Calambra is either on the upper level of the boat (with the PoK portal and the ZL to Stonebrunt), or she is behind one of the buildings near the Drog pen.</P>
<P>If you have your compass activated, there should be a line that you can use to find her. Are you seeing the line on your compass?</P>
<P>by the way - if she is the one on the boat - the instant you step on the boat from the 'bridge', take a right toward the southern section of the boat - turn around to the north and you should see 1-2 ramps up to the NPCs.</P>
