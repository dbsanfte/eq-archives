    <description>PVP has been broken from a melee/offensive caster perspective for quite some time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here is a wierd idea (and I am sure it will catch criticism):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Take each of the weapon damage types (1hs, 2hs, 1hb, 2hb, 1hp, 2hp) and match each one with a resist type if you melee a caster.   So you end up with:&lt;br&gt;   a)  1hs + 2hp = magic&lt;br&gt;   b)   2hs = cold&lt;br&gt;   c)   1hb = fire&lt;br&gt;   d)  2hb = poison&lt;br&gt;    e)  1hp = disease&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So if a melee hits a caster, apply the resists of the caster instead of the AC , avoidance, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2)   Against a caster,  the slower the weapon swing, the  higher the resist mod.    So  make the resist number  negative to the atk delay.   If the atk delay is  20, then apply neg 20.   If it is 50, apply neg 50.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am sure these modified rules for hitting an offensive caster might need some modification.    But this is just a proposal.    Try this for 2 weeks in a couple zones and see what happens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the playerbase might rethink how crippling resists are as a result of this and perhaps the pvp ruleset might get changed.    As is now, there is just not enough casters left to overcome any of the naysayers who will undoubtedly be the melee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shoot away, I am sure this will draw criticism galore.   But at least it is a proposal  instead of a complaint.    Unfortunately, too many folks are afraid to step out with ideas as they usually get shot down by the frequent posters who critique everything but propose nothing.&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <title>Hello? This should have been fixed years ago.</title>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Being a hardcore pvper for the most part myself, I've come to notice numerous problem that hinder my class' ability to efficiently compete in pvp with other high end geared players. I browsed some of the threads and saw some of the same problems I've seen, but figured I'd profess my own views on these particular issues myself since nothing appears to be improving, or looks as if it's in the process of being fixed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So anyways, I play a wizard, but I'm speaking for all casters in general, since it isn't a class specific thing itself exactly. As I already saw, melees have a huge advantage versus casters in pvp. Why, you may ask? There is several reasons. First, there has been nerfs placed on casters over the years to balance casters vs. melee, but it has done the exact opposite. First, no&amp;nbsp;single nuke, for any caster, can do more than 66% of its original damage, not including resists. So, an anguish+ geared melee for example probably has close or above 500+ in all resists unbuffed. If I were to duel a 15k unbuffed warrior with similar resists, and&amp;nbsp; my lure (lands more often for those of you who aren't wizards) spell does about 1500 base damage. 66% of 1500 is roughly 1000 damage. So, if every nuke landed for full damage (which is impossible) I could kill that warrior in 15 nukes. It sounds easy, but it's not. Infact, my best lure usually lands for 400-600 dmg on high geared people. The thing about this I find disturbing is that there is no nerf on melees. Melees dish out 100% of their damage output, while casters dish out 66% of theirs....does that make a bit of sense? Hell no it doesn't. Either nerf melees so their melee is 66% of their regular output, or release the nerf off casters.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Also, another nerf was placed on casters., except this one is a little more fun! The nerf itself does not allow a nuke to do more than 40% of any one person's health per cast. Basically, if I were to attack a lvl 1 wizard in pvp, who had 10 hps, it would take me 3 casts to kill a lvl 1 (keep in mind I'm a lvl 70 wizard). Even if i casted my 5800ish nuke on the lvl one, and it landed, it is not possible for it to do more than 4 dmg to a lvl 1. Fun, huh? Yet, melees can walk up and kill a lvl 1 instantly. My point, however,&amp;nbsp;is not about how long it takes a lvl 1 or not, but rather the issue of nerfs on casters. Specifically, since I'm a wizard, I have the ability manaburn. This nerf does not allow me to do more than 40% of someone's health. Yet, a rogue can walk up and backstab me for a huge amount and do well over 40% of my hps, how is that fair? That's right, it's not, and thus why it needs to be fixed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Our resists have always been a big part of EQ, but does it disadvantage casters in pvp? See, melees, just like casters, can resist spells in pvp obviously. But, can casters resists hits? Nope, we can't. Infact, I don't see a listing in my inventory saying how high my resists are to 1h blunt, slashing, piercing, etc. Is this fair? I certainly don't think it is. And don't argue that AA's provide dmg avoidance mitigation, because those are not a natural stat from an item like spell resists are. From my point of view, to balance this, either the integration of a new resist listing in our inventories for weapons is needed(which I see as highly unneeded personally), or casters' natural dmg avoidance/mitigation needs to be increased equal to that of how spell resists are, otherwise melees have an outright advantage over casters, and it isn't just a small advantage either.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I've found it increasingly hard to beat high end melees as a wizards because of these issues. I'm anguish geared, and I can barely beat melees who are qvic geared. This is ridiculous, because my skill is far superior to a lot of people I duel or fight in pvp and I still lose most the time to melees simply because of the nerfs on my class that&amp;nbsp;hinder my ability to defeat my opponent efficiently. Pvp isn't like it used to be at the beginning of EQ, where skill was a huge determinant in who would win duels. Skill now adays is basically irrelevant and is all gear and class depedant. But, to basically put this, spells just don't land as they should. Casters in general just cannot land spells to match that of a melees dmg output, and I've listed the reasons why. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

I love it how people compare level 70 PVP to level 1. Do you know WHY the 40% nerf was put in place? Because wizards (and Necros) were 1-shot killing people with manaburn and lifeburn and getting like 3-5k crit nukes in PVP. Yes the rogue can walk up to you and backstab you for huge damage, but can he do that from 300 /loc units away? no...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[quote]Our resists have always been a big part of EQ, but does it disadvantage casters in pvp?

Look under DEFENSE, DODGE, PARRY, BLOCK, RIPOSTE... These are your resistances to 1hb/1hs/piercing...Its not our fault you quad kited to level 70... As for teh AAs that provide damage mitigation and advoidance to melee hits... I dont see any AAs that provide spell shielding, dot shielding, ect... which is the direct equivalant to these AAs. Also a very easy and 100% effective way to avoid melee damage is run out of range! Now all you have to **SMURF** about are Rangers bowing you for 500+ a pop from long range. Its pretty impossible for a melee to you know run out of casting range esp with those focus items.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[quote]I've found it increasingly hard to beat high end melees as a wizards because of these issues.

An equally geared melee should be able to pwn a caster hardcore if they get in range. All you uber people are just now reaping the benefits of mudflation that have been hitting the casual gamer over the head for years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Skill hasnt been a determining factor in EQ PVP since late velious/early POP its been all about the gear. Please as someone who is 'anguish geared' go ahead and tell me its all a lie and that all your PVP was 'skillz'. I need a laugh today. What about all those expansions where melees could not get in range of casters to utilize their damage output? What that time when casters could 'ghost' oh so easily and nuke a melee into oblivion? What about the resist changes made to suck up to the ubers? Oh now you cant resist snare with 150 MR, you need to have like 400 MR... And ofcourse the mudflation, of everyone wanting bigger, better weapons, bigger better spells, bigger better pets and bigger better loot... You made your bed now lie in it.I've found it increasingly hard to beat high end melees as a wizards because of these issues. I'm anguish geared, and I can barely beat melees who are qvic geared.

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I love when newb people talk about pvp like they know something.&amp;nbsp; You sir are an idiot and probably never got above level 51.&amp;nbsp; I cant even be at max spell range cast a spell and get it off without a melee getting to me first.&amp;nbsp; I cant land a spell if I do get it off while being hit on.&amp;nbsp; If it does land it is for less than one hit of any melee.&amp;nbsp; This wizard is correct.&amp;nbsp; Casters are quiting in droves becuase it is just not fun anymore.&amp;nbsp; We are so weak in pvp that even melee we way outgear can kill us if they have run 5.&amp;nbsp; Hell you can buy time level gear now in the bazaar and with DoN augments those turn into qvic level.&amp;nbsp; Melee were nerfed to 66% way back in velious because they were over powered.&amp;nbsp; But durning GoD when the pvp changes took place they took that away and reduced players AC and avoidance.&amp;nbsp; Now people are getting hit harder and for more than if they were a NPC.&amp;nbsp; But casters cant return the favor.&amp;nbsp; No way am i going to melee someone who is at 5k hps.&amp;nbsp; All they need is a good weapon to hit me for a **SMURF** load, but with thier 5k hps i only can land spells for 40% of thier hps.&amp;nbsp; So in essence they can 1 round me but i cant do the same.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This game was all about skill and using the enviorment to win PvP battles for a year and a half since the pvp changes went live.&amp;nbsp; But Sony did not update pvp with the new expansions.&amp;nbsp; In the past 6 months (when 4 guilds started farming anguish and now it is 5 guilds) PvP has become broken.&amp;nbsp; People with approximately 100 damage weapons compaired to 60 damage weapons before people got into CoA.&amp;nbsp; Now it is getting worse with Vish being farmed for his 2 hand blunt and Demi plane about to be available for 2 guilds and soon to be available to 4 guilds.&amp;nbsp; Every exapnsion there are better resists and better weapons.&amp;nbsp; There are no new spells that land.&amp;nbsp; Im still using spells for PvP from Kunark era that land while others do not.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you dont know what you are talking about you should remain silent on the subject.&amp;nbsp; You only make yourself look stupid.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Yes I should shut up mmmhm... Ok maybe wizards need an updated lure or something but thats about it. Ofcourse I'm always afraid SOE will screw something up... Like 'Oh lets give wizards the ability to use all their mana in a single nuke, and while we're at it lets give them the ability to gate with a 0 second cast time'... Yeah sound familiar? Sure does to me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess it'd be ok if they gave wizards a lure that was less mana efficient or less damage than their normal nukes as all lures were back in the day (IE. Your best nuke was like 1800 damage for 450 mana (-10 Resist), the Lure was 882 for 310 mana (-300 resist). Ofcouse, this doesnt include the innate lower resists on spells that all wizards have as part of their class)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nowadays Wizards nuke for 5848 damage for 1550 mana (-10 Resist). So following the pattern a level 70 lure would be more like 2865 damage for 1067 mana?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I dont know really I'm not a dev but I dont like the idea of giving casters more power. Just wait a few expansions for things to right themselfs... I mean look at the pattern...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Old World = Casters powerful (Hardly anyone had resist gear except MR)&lt;br&gt;Kunark = Equilibrium/Balanced (Melee DPS roughly equaled caster DPS. Some resist gear but not overpowering. Necros had their almost unresistable lifetaps, Druids had their almost unresistable dots, Wizards had their almost unresistable nukes)&lt;br&gt;Velious = Melees powerful (Primal Weapons $$)&lt;br&gt;Luclin = Casters powerful (Manaburn/Lifeburn anyone?)&lt;br&gt;PoP/LDON/LOY = Hybrids Powerful (This is the era where hybrid spells really broke from their 50% effectiveness of the parent class, and we dont need to tell you what AM3/EQ and POP Bows did to PVP)&lt;br&gt;GOD/OOW/DON = Melee/Hybrids Powerful (Epic 1.5/2.0s shot melee dps through the roog)</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;you know what, its all the high end AA and gear that has always got in the way of skill in pvp, and they always try to fix it with changes that effect everyone.  they should stop ganking on the mid level pvp as a sideffect of 'fixing' high end pvp, because highend pvp will always be thrown off by the latest expansion, thus requiring another fix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;pvp would be alot better if it was pre PoP, alot like the discord server was.  That way these anguish geared folks can stop complaining that their gear gets in the way of their skill.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wizards still do quite well against me as do necros (with 493 average resist unbuffed). Personally id like to see spells land  better but I think casters are far from useless in pvp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the way gear is today there are very few classes out there who can actually kill people one on one. Hell even casters are pushing 14-15k buffed hp now adays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>
