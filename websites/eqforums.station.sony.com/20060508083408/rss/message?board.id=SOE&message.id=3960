The server saw her and waved back and just walked off! Then someone else form teh table got up and got the coffee from the lil tables that had the coffee on it. When he brought it back to the table the same server came back and mumbled something and took the coffee. It was werid, plus when the food came out the 2nd time around *I was late to the brunch* I got up to get food, I waited for them to leave and got up and scooped me some food and I just got a nasty glare from the servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all the whole event was great wish there was more time between panels or have some of the panels in the same room. On Saturday it was annoying to keep going back and forth to room 2 to room 3 over and over! It would of been nice to just have stayed in one room. :P&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See you all next year :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I went to the Fan Faire in Atlanta.  I have several suggestions for future events.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The vitamin water was a nice touch, but there was none distributed on Saturday.   The snacks did not last much past Friday noon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There didn't seem to be enough events.  Thursday was all about registration, and the mornings and evenings were taken up with combined events.  There was no alternative activity for those that did not want to pay for the brunch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scheduling was a bit erratic.   It seemed that all the Everquest panels were on Saturday, and all the other games were on Friday.  The EQ player had almost nothing to do on Friday.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bring some of the EQ novels.  The SoE store did not have any of the novels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;More chairs in the 'community' area.   Game-specific areas would be nice to help people get together, especially on the Thursday / Friday timeframe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed the panels, except that people still do not appreciate silence.  It was difficult to hear even with functioning microphones over the constant murmur.   I would have enjoyed these a bit more if the panels were in smaller rooms with better accoustics and repeated multiple times instead of a single session in a cavern.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It appears that all the non-Atlanta attendees and staff neglected to take home several souviner bags of pollen.  I have attempted to e-mail several SoE staff, but I can't seem to successfully attach pollen to an e-mail.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for an interesting convention.  I would probably attend another if it were close enough for me to consider it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I had a blast, from start to finish.&amp;nbsp; Wish it wasn't over, though I'm not sure I'd of been able to keep standing another day.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;I found everyone mega friendly and polite.&amp;nbsp; Was truly great to mingle around, especially as it was my first FF.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Constructive critiscm time.&lt;br&gt;Mix up the server tables next time.&amp;nbsp; I'm from AB, and alas not many people (4) was from there, so I wandered around a bit, but it was great to talk to people from other servers and see their view on alot of things.&amp;nbsp; Everyone was so friendly, so be great to just mix things up even more.&amp;nbsp; Maybe even one of the meals a 'class' table to meet people from other servers but can share war-stories.&lt;br&gt;Err, that's pretty well the only thing I can think of bad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I REALLY liked the off-site event.&amp;nbsp; Both the downstairs Kareoke, and the upstairs band.&amp;nbsp; Great there was a fair bit of diversity there.&amp;nbsp; I know you can't please all the people all the time, but it seemed to me it hit the nail on the head for the most people's tastes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh yeah, last thing, next time, get a hotel that doesn't have quite so many floors.&amp;nbsp; Was making me dizzy with the height!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can't wait for next one.&amp;nbsp; Think it's going to become a regular thing for me now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attended and enjoyed all of it.  I thoroughly enjoyed having a chance to chat with you on Saturday, after the EQ live quests.  You already have my ideas for future 'quests' so I won't spill the beans by giving clues here.  :smileywink:  I can't wait to see what you cook up for the next one (provided I can attend).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My only comments or recommendations would be to either have a 'map' or layout of the event and post it in various places, along with the schedule, so those of us who try and cram it all in can plan accordingly.  I found it was tough to keep track of which events were happening, and where, because there was just SO much going on at certain time blocks.  Friday seemed to me as the lesser of the two days when it came to structure and clean planning.  The events on Friday seemed to be 'blocky' with lulls and spurts of activity rather than the smoother flow of Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was well planned and very successful.  Everyone from my guild is still talking about it.  Being able to actually meet face-to-face -- not face-to-crowd -- with some of the developers and customer service/game master staff was a real treat.  For me, it makes the game so much more personal than just some piece of software that I bought at EB and use for entertainment.  Now, it's easier to feel like part of a community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well done!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
