&lt;P&gt;Well, this is&amp;nbsp;a toughie isn't it? Have to satisfy the majority i guess. When my friends and I heard of the progression server, one thing came to mind. Starting from the beginning. So what is the goal here? To go through every expansion to experience it again? To the folks who never experienced the beginning of the game, it was awesome. Just to get on and go kill a few ghouls at the undead ruins in EC or go to EC cave and look at Bags of stuff people are selling at first torch because there wasn't a&amp;nbsp;bazaar. It was simple. So no matter how hard this is, its something people want; its something i want. Now how do we actually progress on a progression server? Thats simple too. How did we progress in the first place? Yes granted it will take a while to get to luclin and my beloved Vex Thall zone but to love the game again you have to start with EQ classic and give everyone time and chance to enjoy it. Once the highest tier of zones in Classic have been conquered for the first time, wait a month or so then bring out Kunark. That way, more people will have progressed enough to tackle Kunark with Seblis, Veeshan's Peak, and the other wonders there. Set a moderate flow with these expansions...not too long not too short. Flagging is great and all but was it in the beginning? No. So it shouldnt be there. Having to use a ship and paying wizards and druids for ports to get anywhere. The what we call 'hardships' we call now was just a part of the game then. That is the EQ i remember. I like EQ, but i use to really love it. If you put too much of the modern EQ in this there will be no point.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I do like the idea of stopping the progression of expansions at some point. Planes of power would be a great place to stop. It will take a long time for VT to be in competition of guilds...when you have 5 guilds who could all do a VT cycle, then its time to expand to PoP. This is a good chance for you, SoE, to fix what you regret or didnt think really worked. But the point is, no one really wants LoY or discord or Omens. They can do that on their home servers. Granted that by the time you could expand to that, every other server will have other expansions to keep them occupied. So if Progression really is a hit when PoP comes out, then maybe you should think to make different expansions that even the regular servers dont have. Just something to think about.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Although some people may disagree, I would much rather see stupid comments than sarcastic ones. And although wishing the gameplay could be like it used to be may be considered stupid by you, many other people and I believe it would be great. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You didn't say we were one post wonders but you agreed with a nasty comment about them. Who cares? Just because people are new on the boards doesn't mean they are new to the game. I have played the game before Kunark and I played for years. All the people who are 'new' on the boards have likely just been drawn back by the possibility of being able to play the game the way it was when they loved it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Oh and by the way, none of your responses made me feel stupid in any way and I'm sure they didn't make anyone else feel that way either. But it is apparent to me at least that that is the intent of many of your posts. Any time anyone says "it would be cool if they .... " You have to make some sarcastic little comment that makes me dislike seeing your name even more. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Well this is off topic and I'm not going to post about it any more. I just wanted to let you know (like others have I've seen) that you are annoying and we wish you would keep your nasty comments to yourself.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Thank you.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Sorry in being only just seeing this but I not in forum a lot.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This waht is my thinking about server for starting at begin of game.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I play for 3 years and guild for me is trying kill the EP god Rathe Council as it is being the last one for Time getting to. Guild is family freind not hardraid kind so take nearly one year to being complete on PoP progression.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I not think it be fun to be going to kill again in Misty Thicket spiders. And the orcs in Commonland are not fun .&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I not want to be having 2 years more in getting new druid to level 65 to being able again to be killing god of EP like Coirnav.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Sorry for my being not good in English.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Jayabalard I don't understand why you have to have a smart comment to everything anyone says. I don't care if we are "one post wonders" We are just enthusiastic about the game the way it used to be and how it used to appeal to us. We have a right to post our opinions on here about how we would like things without you trying to make everyone feel like a moron. We don't care if you disagree with 1000 points that anyone puts down that they liked about the game. It seems that you are massively outnumbered by people who liked it the old way rather than people who like it your way. So please, let us post our opinions without your smart words following. thank you</description>

      <description>Personally I'm just super excited about the new server because&amp;nbsp; my&#xD;
fond memories of the game mainly are rooted in the old days, from a&#xD;
little pre-Luclin til PoP. To me, that is EQ culture; EC tunnel, hidden&#xD;
complexities of the game that weren't handed to you. It was rough and&#xD;
the culture of the game was formed by the player, not Sony or Verant.&#xD;
It seemed to me like much more of a dynamic world with alot more&#xD;
character, and to be able to relive that excites me beyond belief.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I'm not sure how I feel about individual flagging or guild flagging.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I believe that the whole 'one for all' stance on progression would make&#xD;
things much more balanced and disallow for the server to become&#xD;
increasingly reminiscent of our current normal servers.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
As you can see, I cling tightly onto the dream of having a server that&#xD;
plays like the servers used to back maybe three years ago.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>I was hoping this would be a bit more classical but its not.  All it is really will be a bunch of people going over making a level one character not using stuff until they complete that expansion.  If people really wanted a server like this they could just make a post here choose a server, and follow same rules don't make a character until its out don't use zones that aren't out.  Most likely people wouldn't do this but really is no difference.  Only major difference I noticed is you can't press V to open AA's instead you have to Press I and Alt Adv. Think it will be a big hit to start until people soon find out its nothing like what they wanted.  Instead of making it so you can't open AA window with V could have removed the map untilm LoY.  Hoping the real one is better, beta is very boring 5 minutes of it and I'm done(if that).</description>

      <description>Went on server so far I do not like that there are maps.. that was LoY... you start out at your Guildmaster so you do not have to explore your city not that you would anyway with maps... there is a find button.  When you die you don't lose anything until lvl 5 not the way it was.  I log in and there are lvl 50+ already it won't be any fun if people can fly through like that.  Noticed the iksars are open .. New graphics.  Is there anything from original EQ at all on this server?</description>

&lt;P&gt;I love the idea of this server but I wish that some things were different. I wish hell levels would stay in. I wish the boats would work and I wish the old things people considered 'a pain' were still in the game. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I know that hell levels were hard and people say "waaahhh i wanna be level 70 with 10 million aa points now" but seriously, things like that are what made the game a challenge. They were put there for a reason when the game was first released. It was obviously successful when these types of things were in before. Things like this are what made the game a success. They pulled the community together. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;People say "You're never going to recapture that feeling of when you first started" Well of course you can't. But the feeling of community could be recaptured. THAT is what made the game good. Zoning into somewhere and saying where the heck am I this is so cool was fun but that isn't what made players stay for 5+ years. It was the community and the challenge of the game. Feeling like if you screw up something bad will actually happen. I mean shoot, if you are just playing to powerlevel you might as well go play oblivion or something and save yourself the monthly fee. I for one am all for hell levels, working boats, looking at your spell book, bartering, asking for ports or walking and all the things that were part of the original and well thought out game. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Good luck sony I hope you can give a sense of community again.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Still no, yes , no or otherwise on cost of this server.One could guess mods are unsure.Or SOE are waiting to spring it.I find the lack of mention as to whether or not any cost will be inccured omnious.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Ok, for 1)&amp;nbsp; it's just an idea.&amp;nbsp; Don't get bent out of shape for me expressing my idea.&amp;nbsp; For 2)&amp;nbsp; read where it says "GROUP TASK".&amp;nbsp; I know many, many people that have stopped playing EQ and are coming back due to the fact they think it will be a personal unlocking of the content.&amp;nbsp; The only thing I said was one way of unlocking will probably be quicker than the other due to the simple fact that there are a ton of peeps that play EQ 24/7.&amp;nbsp; And your statement about my friend can't join my guild cuz of this is already in effect, my friend.&amp;nbsp; Even some "family guilds" I know of require a toon to be at least level 35 before they can be invited.&amp;nbsp; This is just my opinion.&amp;nbsp; Don't insinuate that I haven't thought this through.&amp;nbsp; I have, and I imagine many other people that are wanting the personal unlocking have also.&amp;nbsp; If a friend starts a toon on this server, and I'm at Kunark when it happens, I'll gladly come back to the old world to help him with his&amp;nbsp;unlocking.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;But you would &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;never&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; reach certain content. Many people wouldn't even be able to get to velious, and cerainly not luclin. It simply takes too much time, skill, and numbers. Perhaps they could find a way to allow guilds to unlock content for themselves but the unlock server wide would be done after the amount of time the expansion took to be realeased originally. Still some major down-falls with this idea but its a compramise. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I never saw the idea mentioned, and I'm not completely sure anything is set in stone yet.&amp;nbsp; But I just wanted to drop my 2cp's in on how this should work.&amp;nbsp; No Server-wide unlocking.&amp;nbsp; It's being called progression for a reason, and unlocking it for everyone after a certain ammount of time is *not* progressing, it's giving them the content.&amp;nbsp; I agree with some peoples statements about group tasks unlocking progression, and I agree with the raiding aspect of it.&amp;nbsp; So, here's my 2cp's:&amp;nbsp; Why not have both?&amp;nbsp; Have a couple of raid type target mobs for those that would like to raid, and have a task that will eventually unlock the next era.&amp;nbsp; For the raid mobs, have 3 or 4 targets that would need to be taken down.&amp;nbsp; And for the group task, something that casual players could do somewhat easily.&amp;nbsp; Granted, one might take longer than the other, but so what?&amp;nbsp; This is supposed to be a progression server, where certain goals are accpomplished before you can move on to the next era.&amp;nbsp; Raiders would probably unlock each era quicker, but if you look at the end game for regular servers,&amp;nbsp;the people from high end guilds are way ahead of everyone on basis of gear, aa's,&amp;nbsp;and time in game.&amp;nbsp; Well, usually.&amp;nbsp; I personally want to say, "WOOT, i can go to kunark now because I was able to get keyed/flagged/whatever for it."&amp;nbsp; I don't want to see, "You can now access Kunark because 3 months has passed on the server, or this guild just unlocked it for everyone."&amp;nbsp; If I didn't have to work on my own progression to go to new areas, I'd stay on my regular server.&amp;nbsp; I want to have to do certain things to be able to move forward, and I imagine all the old school players feel somewhat similar to me.&amp;nbsp;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Except how much easier is the game gonna get when the guilds that have advanced to luclin content are selling twink gear to people that haven't even gotten to kunark?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And what about people joining guilds that have already moved on in content? Why should my friend be excluded from joining my guild simply because he wasn't in it from the very launch of the server?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;People with the personal unlock idea don't seem to think it through too thoroughly...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I quit playing EQ a couple years ago now.&amp;nbsp; I've bounced around from game to game searching for anything worth dumping 5 years of my life into, and it's just not out there anymore.&amp;nbsp; For me Everquest changed too much, but I'd be back for sure if this comes true.&amp;nbsp; I've never found a game that could hold my attention that friggin long.&amp;nbsp; I've always thought about starting a new account and starting over, but there never seemed to be a place to do it with all the high end guilds in Anguish and so forth.&amp;nbsp; I hope this happens cus it's what I (and probably a whole lot more) have been waiting for since GoD.&amp;nbsp; I can't wait till I'm farming for Emp and VT keys again.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What I missed about Everquest in the last couple of years is the amount of freedom you have with pulling mobs.. trains.. a-holes camping stuff... the way rare spawns work.&amp;nbsp; Every game I've tried just seems way too mechanical.. If I cast something on this mob the all will come no matter what.&amp;nbsp; I like the versatility Everquest offered you as you could build your own tactics, and the feeling you got when you pulled something off that seemed impossible.&amp;nbsp; That is what I'll be coming back for and I'm freaking stoked if this comes together.. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See you all in Norrath soon I hope&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
