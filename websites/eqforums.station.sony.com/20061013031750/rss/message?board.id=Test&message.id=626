    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Hello everyone and thank you for your patience.&amp;nbsp; Tomorrow we are going to take the first steps and enable all expansion on the Test Server for free.&amp;nbsp; This means that if you haven't purchased an expansion you will still be able to play the content on the Test Server.&amp;nbsp; This access will not transfer to any of the live servers and you will not get any /claim items that may come with that expansion.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We are going to be putting this as a news item on our website and also restate all the great reasons to play on Test.&amp;nbsp; This is our first step in beginning to market the Test Server to our existing players.&amp;nbsp; Our ultimate goal is to increase the number of players on the server while keeping it as close to a live server as possible.&amp;nbsp; The best testing we get is from people who are playing the game normally in this environment.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks again for your continued support of the server and its community.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Hi,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After spending some time over on EQ2 Test Server and Proddy Servers, I thought I would try out EQ TEST here. But after reading all these posts, am not even sure I want to. But am going to give it a shot and see what happens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have created a new toon on EQ TEST named Shadalarion.  Half-Elf Ranger.   However I got a question. How do I use the TESTBUFF command??  I have tried several variations like&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;/testbuff&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;/testbuff 25&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;/test buff 25&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;None of these commands work.   I see posted on this board, people saying that they have used this command to get to lvl 25 and yet it does not work for me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thx.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Thx for the tip.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok, I get to POK and do the testbuff to lvl 25 and found a nice zone with some light blues.  After killing 3 of them at one time, I noticed a that mana regen is dead slow and while health and mana is regenerating I get ambushed by 4 light blues and 1 yellow and die in a hurry. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Am sorry but this is crappy...  insane slow regeneration, you got to be kidding me and the cropse run... kinda hard to do that when you do not have any money to buy a soulstone... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have deleted my toon and going back to EQ 2 Testing.   Maybe if they ever decide to revamp EQ and use EQ 2 rulesets like mana regen and death rules, I might consider trying it out again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bye.. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Hey all, I took a break from the game largely due to RL things going on with work and whatnot and now I am back and carefully considering my options again. I know this much, I want to divide my time between playing a character (my new mage) on Combine to experience the game as it once was. I came late to the party in 2003 and always felt I'd kind of missed the first half of EQ. It's been great fun starting off in a Gfay teeming with newbies and no pok, no bazaar, no newbie armor quests, etc. I've really enjoyed it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;However, the comments I made earlier in this thread still stand for me. I love EQ and I'm seriously thinking of paying out the 200 bucks a pop for both my accounts (I just bought new copies of Titanium and Sol Ro) to play at the cheapest rate for the next couple of years.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My take on the test server benefits is that they are more than enough incentive for the kind of people SOE most needs to play on the server, which is players who are going to play the entire game. There is no such thing as a instant raiding end game server in any game and I don't really get why people think they ought to have that here. I can doing that in limited cases for limited periods of time with throwaway toons so you can beta a new expansion's high end content but it's not helpful at all for test where the idea is to test all of the game, all of the zones, all of the features. EverQuest is a great experience from the start to the highest end and everwhere inbetween if you ask me. How can you try to test all that if you grant people instant 60 or 70 testbuffs and raid gear for example? Well, of course you can't.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Personally, I think it would be helpful for the EQ developers to clearly explain the purpose of the test server and its usefulness to them in making EQ the best game it can be on the live servers. Maybe that would help to head off a lot of stuff at the pass that is never going to happen on this server and should not happen on this server.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I worked in software test engineering professionally for a decade and can appreciate what they are trying to do here but I am sure the average player has little idea of what test is truly for beyond testing the end-game. People need to understand that if for some reason they simply wanted to test the endgame, they'd have given you /testbuff 70 with raid gear. It is not what this is for and people should stop asking for and expecting it simply because it's not what the server is needed for.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I can appreciate how test server players would feel some frustration and perhaps alienation from players who pop in for a few levels and never come back or perhaps visit rarely. I can also understand how when some players arrive expecting hand outs, instant hands-up, etc. they would more than any other server feel frustrated. To them I'd say, don't even let it phase you. As Nancy Reagan was so fond of saying, "Just say no." Easy, easy. No problem. I wouldn't let that stuff burn me out at all. Besides, begging, feelings of entitlement by some, etc. is on all servers, not just test and I know you guys know that. I sometimes tease the beggars where I am saying, sorry son but ye are going to have to earn ye way as we all do. Here is where you might go get what you want... on your own... lol&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I enjoy raiding but at this point, I'd enjoy a family guild that hopefully is able to raid sometimes and don't care what pace we do things at. I am not in a big hurry. I just want to enjoy the ride and make some friends along the way. Otherwise, I'd be soloing in Oblivion which is a very cool game but unfortunately, none of you are there, at least not when I am. :-)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The stuff I said early on in the thread about how the double xp works for me still holds. It's not that I want to rush to 70 and the lastest end-game encounter, best gear, etc. It is simply that where I love the game and enjoy playing alts, I'd love to have the time for it and double xp allows me to make some reasonable progress with alts given that I still do have a job, real life, etc. The Vet AAs for all my toons is a nice icing on the cake. Testbuff to 25 is excellent because any experienced player can take it from there and save some time if they like without any issues affecting grouping in pretty short order. If you have been playing EQ for years and cannot figure out a class at 25 on your own in short order and go from there, I'd say playing from level one wouldn't help you a lot with that issue.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I was thinking of moving my main to a server with players (perhaps Asian) who raid at times I can make. I work 3-11 EST now and so there's little chance to raid at all where I am today (Stromm). Somebody had mentioned the idea of earning a transfer of your characters by playing one character on test to level 50. I kind of like that idea without getting bogged down in whether it ought to be 50 or whatever level. While I'd like to enjoy the whole game with several alts and sometimes box two of them for fun, it would be nice if I could take my main and the benefits of his work for years with me too. As it stands now, I have to think about my desire to spend some time enjoying Combine, at least while the world is pre GoD, what about my 70 Cleric on Stromm, and what about who I'd like to play on test. Realistically, that's too much. I don't want to be spread over three servers, two is stretching it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I guess I have to think about letting my cleric go and making a new one on test. That might not be the end of the world as for a very long time now, I've wished I'd gone Dark Elf instead of High Elf as I like to solo some for fun and the clicky snare the DEs can quest for would be very helpful. I was talking about two-boxing combinations elsewhere and I mused about playing a shaman to back up my soloing/tanking cleric. Unusual for sure but that could actually work really well. Hell, if I can solo a cleric successfully, I can solo anything so having a shammy with me would be awesome. It's a long road to an Anguish flagged, DS keyed and raid geared cleric though with all spells, including ancients, etc.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I do wish the developers would consider allowing players like me to earn a place for thier main's on test by establishing another character on the server. It's a win-win because you give lots of incentive to people to play from 25 on to earn that and you bring in some high level geared characters to test the end-game stuff too. I respect the need for moderation in all things and careful consideration of the value and consequences of any decisions you guys make but think about that one. And perhaps limit it to one earned character move at least at first to see how that works out for the server, with all the regular rules in place regarding this is a transfer, not a copy, and it's a permanent thing. Players making a permanent transfer benefit by getting to know the server first earning this transfer and the community grows with players who want to be there and it all unfolds at a reasonable pace.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Sorry for the long post. I ramble on too much and I am famous for it. On a bright note though, its because I love the game and the friends I make here in Norrath. :)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Welcome to test, kick back and stay awhile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Short of some one doing it or SoE making an auto join Guild for new Characters, that one should be able to leave at any time, with instructions on how to leave given in the GMOTD, you might just as well use the General Chat as your Guild Chat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As long as your not being obnoxious then no one should give you grief and if they do, then HOPEFULLY there are N number of test server regulars that will try to put them streight and help you out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know that a while back, maybe a year or so, a group of people got together from the &amp;quot;The Newbie Zone&amp;quot; forum here and made a guild.  You might pmail Kythera(sp) the moderator you see all over the place on the forums and ask her if/what she recalls of it and who knows there may be a guild already set up and waiting for who ever the Guild Leader is to transfer that to an active player.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by EnigmaMaitreya on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;04-21-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;07:54 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;First, let me introduce myself.  I'm Coii, a level 70 druid on Test Server.  I'm a member of Primal Brood.  I've been playing on test since late 2000, and Coii was created  in March of 2001.   I've been a Guide for Beta for the last 2 or 3 expansions, and I've met several people.  Some of the people on beta did not know that Test Server even existed.  ( recently some of my Beta friends have come to play on Test ) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've seen the population of Test drop dramatically over the years.  But, it's nice to see the influx of new people who have come to Test to play.  I'm usually in the General channel everyday.  I'd like to clarify that the majority of the rudeness to the newer players is caused by the people who have come to play on Test in the last year or so.  Not all the the Newer Old Test players are rude.  Most actually try to take the time to help the Newest people who have come to the Server.   The actual *Old Timers* ( 4 or more years on Test )are willing to help and answer questions.  I, myself, just send a tell, to the person asking the question, and try my best to answer it and help them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of the posts that I have read on the boards about *Test Server* actually scare me.  If I were a person, reading the boards, and knew nothing about Test Server..... I would be scared away, from even attempting to create a Character there.  There are so many that are stuck in their ways, and are so afraid of change.  Some are saying  things that are only  their personal opinions, and not those of the majority of Test Players. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's been said over and over, that everytime we log onto the Test Server we are in reality TESTING it !  It does not matter what level we are, or what zones we are in, WE ARE STILL TESTING on Test Server.  Test Server is nothing like Beta !  They are 2 entirely different *Testing* type servers.   Some of the newer people come to play on Test, because they think that there will be World Emotes every few minutes asking for X-number of level 35's to help test a new mob in a zone.  That's not TEST server.. That's Beta !....  But don't be surprised if you are suddenly summoned to a zone, and killed quickly by a REALLY RED mob, while a dev is standing next to you chuckling.  ( It does happen ! )We test by logging in, loading our character, and going about our normal day to day business.  Whether it be LDoN's , Monster Missions, Shrouds, WoS grinding, Signet Camping, PoR Missions, DoDh Spell missions, Trade Skills, and yes........even doing the Tutorial.  Some of us Raid........Yes, believe it or not, there are actually raiding guilds on Test Server.&lt;br&gt;Preparing for the raid, and MGB buffing, and boom.. the zone drops !  ( Gee, we found a bug )  That's what Test server is....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There have been many pro's and con's to Copies/Transfers to Test Server.  I personally feel that there are several people out there who actually DO want to transfer to Test Server.  I think that these people should be given the option to TRANSFER.   I feel that most of the people who are sincere about transfering to Test Server have come to Test, made a character, leveled the char up to a point, and actually WANT to make their home on Test.  From what I have seen and heard, the people who want to transfer are of all various levels.  Which is what Test needs...... ALL LEVELS.  Gherig and Coyote Moon, have recruited and pl'd several people so they can raid the higher level zones.  Primal Brood is a casual raiding guild with higher level members, but the majority have alts of all levels.  There are several lower level guilds that have been started recently.  Not to mention the other older guilds like,  Zen Cabal, Dark Advocates, and Avoik, just to name a few.  I don't think it will be a huge influx of people, but even if it's 300 new transfers, I don't see the harm in it.  Test doesn't have GM's, but on a daily basis, we have Devs and QA people who are there working everyday.  I've even seen a Guide floating around, every now and then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you haven't visited Test Server, come try it out.......  If you like it, and feel like staying and leveling up your chars, we're happy to have you.  If you are sincere about transfering your character from your Live Server to Test Server, maybe that will happen soon !  Hopefully, Raghnell and others will combine a list of of the people who want to make Test Server their new home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;just my 2cp&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just recently started playing on the Test Server, have myself a lowbie lvl 34 mage that I'm having fun with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes its quiet but I kind of enjoy that because I'm sick of the rude losers on live servers. I did /testbuff and it was nice and I was surprised at the gear. Its not the greatest gear in the world but when I FIRST started playing EQ about 4 years ago I had WAY worse at that level so it was deffinently helpful.  I would absolutely LOVE to transfer my level 70 cleric main that I have raided with extensively and join one of the raiding guilds on the server.  Unfortunantly I don't forsee that happening any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My only question is about guilds. I see guild tags running around out there but I haven't been able to find any of the lower level base &amp;quot;family&amp;quot; guilds to have some companionship with. While I enjoy soloing, sometimes we just need some friends to laugh with or cry with when you fail. And the dust each other off and go take on that mob again, just to say you killed him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have met some great people, and did have one person give me some low end gear (although better than test gear) unbidden and that was very nice.  Hope to get to know more of you. If you have a mid 30s toon and want to group, look for Aanlaraa.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I am impressed! I think the testbuff gear is excellent.. it is free after all,  and it is a direct reflection of actual gears stats that we have all worn.  I had a blast... I was mostly alone, but that has its good points too. I requested in OOC 3 or 4 times this weekend for a Temp and received one each time. I asked for a SOW near a group of regulars 3 times and received one each time. I asked exactly 2 questions in OOC POk this weekend and was answered each time in a friendly manner. Maybe this thread and the drive to expand the player base on Test is changing the way NOOB's are treated, but I enjoyed my time this weekend, and will be back!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did not however ask to be powerleveled, or ask for PP, or expect to be coddled because I was new. This may be the difference in the negative responses one gets form this community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I know its some what off the topic of this thread, but since its been mentioned a couple of times....&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ive made my permanent home on test now, I dont even bother to patch the regular servers anymore. I box a shaman (ambeorix) and a berserker (Karzek). Ive had alot of fun, I wont say that the added benefits of test&amp;nbsp;didnt have anything to do with the decision but Im glad I did come here. Most of the people Ive met are not rude and are willing to lend a helping hand. I am glad I decided to stay here now and I dont plan on leaving.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;That said, as my name still indicates, my&amp;nbsp;original character Udayen is on maelin. Hes lvl 68 with elemental + quality gear, a very very nice pet focus and over 300 aas. If I had the option of copying or transfering him to Test I certainly wouldnt hesitate. Anyways, I dont mind leveling up new characters so I can play on test, but I sure would like it if I could move Udayen over and start playing him again, I did put alot of time and effort into him. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Aye, well said and far less words than the rambling elf (me) did previous to your post. I have a cleric who like your mage has about 300 AA and is flagged for anguish, ds keyed and has an average of 15 hours a week over several years put into him. It would be sweet if I could bring him here but for now I won't ask for that again. I'll just play some new toons there and see how it goes.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You know what's really funny? Yesterday, before ever seeing your post I had thought a lot about what combo I'd like to do first on test and what toons I'd love to play. In a thread on TNZ someone was talking about doing a Shaman and Zerker and I'd replied that should work well and be fun to play as did some other people. After that I decided, you know what? I am going to play either a pair of Ogres or a pair of Barbarians and do the Zerker/Shammy thing too.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It's great I can start at 25 and skip the brand newbie stuff and with some gear to level and spells, head out and give it a go. I didn't have time today but sometime soon I'll be rolling and playing those guys on test. :-)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Or one of our few resident &amp;quot;I know everything about Test and Everquest&amp;quot; masters gives someone what for either in general channel or here on these boards when they ask a question or make a suggestion.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That still happening too unfortunately.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Yes a Guild that all new players are put into is a two edged sword.  It can be used to cut against them, on the other hand it is also a Guild and they may or may not feel more familure with being in a guild than not being in one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I see a number of new players asking if there are guilds recruiting low level players.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would seem that the positive edge of the sword would delay that question until they have thier feet firmly planted on the ground.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do not think it should be mandated (i.e. the GMOTD telling them how to leave the Guild).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would give them access to the Guild Hall, banks, portals and the health and mana regen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The above may or may not make them feel more at home on Test Server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As to the Negative side of the sword, the recognition as being a new player.  Well what can I say, any jerk that does that gets on my crap list asap.  As it would be totaly uncalled for and absolutly against Test Server Best Interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides, I want Nibele the NutCase to be the Guild Leader or Officer and put his .... money were his mouth is.  I would challenge him and his guild to see who can take Naggy / Vox down the fastest.  I cant believe some that tells me he can Solo Naggy and then goes AFK on Zek. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Said more directly, the established guilds might be encouraged to activly engage the SoE guild to do things, participate in things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one can disagree with your point, there is a down side to this but we as a community should be able to minimize it if we are all on the same page and want to see the population grow via people that come to test and start up characters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
