      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The danger is when they start executing people with little to no evidence, just because they need to harvest their organs to save some important or powerful person's life.</description>

Furthermore, it is not just about the impact to the person whose corpse is being used but the societal impact of harvesting organs. Many people have a hard enough time dealing with mortality. Also, imagine what would happen if a capitalist system got into "the game".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I firmly believe that humanity requires organ donation to come from the donor, not society. Yes, it may be cruel for an innocent child to die because of such a philosophy, but there are many sacrifices to be made to preserve "humanity".&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by ether_sphynx on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;04-26-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;05:02 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

This is as much social conditioning as anything else as cremation and burial have both been absolutly terrible fates for those alive at various points in history.  If a serious push was made in the right way, then in 20-30 years time it would be considered strange if you opted out of donating your organs.</description>

&lt;P&gt;I would agree wholeheartedly with you Sita....&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But there's a problem.&amp;nbsp; It's the same reason you can't sell one of your kidneys for cash.&amp;nbsp; Who's to say that you werwen't forced into having that kidney removed?&amp;nbsp; Who's to say that a company won't be able to claim your body as an asset to repay your outstanding debts?&amp;nbsp; Who's to say people won't just murder people to harvest their organs?&amp;nbsp; It's a very delicate line, one that gets crossed occasionally already with the black market.... but if it became more mainstream, it could get quickly out of hand.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Then again, people are going to do crooked things regardless.&amp;nbsp; If there was no money to be made form these organs, it would probably work out alright.&amp;nbsp; But it would have to be absolutely free.&amp;nbsp; That aloe would make it hard to implement.&amp;nbsp; No business is going to want to mess with organ harvesting of dead bodies if they can't make money off of it.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Does anyone here understand the nature of capital punishment in China? The majority of people executed in China are not murderers. China executes people for non-violent crimes like embezzlement and corruption in political office. They also execute a lot of political prisoners. You can be executed in China for things that wouldn't even get you arrested in the US.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;In China, the State takes ownership of the bodies of executed prisoners. The deceased family is not allowed to claim the body. The State disposes of them as they see fit.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I can imagine a scenario where a condemmed prisoner is held on "death row" until such time as someone needs a new liver, or heart.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Order comes in for a type B Positive liver and the warden goes thru his list of inmates to decide who's going to die today....&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I think that is another issue..at least as far as my responses. My impression was we were simply talking about the ethics of removing organs from an executed or about to be executed&amp;nbsp;prisoner. Chinas take on what is a capitol crime is certainly not in line with most folks thinking here in the states</description>

      <description>Using organs of deceased prisoners to safe someone's life is something else than using the remains as fertiziler. Someone commited murder? Sounds like a great way to repay debt to society by saving someone's life with your organs after you die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not like China is the only country in the world 'mistreating' prisoners.

      <description>Life is full of hypocricies. They are everywhere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, organs from bodies could save lives. So can enriching soil... ;) If you really feel like they have no rights and we can freely harvest their organs, then we should put the rest of their carcass to good use as well. We do it to cattle. Since it is just a lifeless carcass, why not make it national policy that once you die, your body becomes property of the state and goes to the highest bidder? That way, in death everyone gives a little life to their countrymen. To keep the undertakers from going out of business, we could convert them to "meat packing" facilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even though some criminals are put to death, I believe that they still have fundamental rights. Others' opinions vary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have you signed your organ donor card (back of DL in most US states)?</description>

To keep the undertakers from going out of business, we could convert them to "meat packing" facilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even though some criminals are put to death, I believe that they still have fundamental rights. Others' opinions vary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have you signed your organ donor card (back of DL in most US states)?&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I may not be in the US, but yes I have, I am an organ donor and hope that when I die, parts of my body will be put to use to help other people. I've made sure my parents know my wishes, so not to be kept in a coma forever, but instead end it with dignity and the ability to help someone...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And enriching soil is not a very big problem, there is plenty of fertilizer, people can make artificial fertilizer, we are far away from creating (enough) artificial organs. In my opinion two completely different things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have to say I do not agree with organs being taken without consent, but I can see the other side of the argument as well.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science fiction predicts again...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larry Niven had a lot to say about organs being &amp;quot;harvested&amp;quot; from criminals. In a short story (I can't remember what it was called), minor offences such as driving through a red light are capital crimes so that the organ banks which feed the insatiable demand for body parts can be kept full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also has some stories about &amp;quot;organlegging&amp;quot; in the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://sites.inka.de/~W3775/reviews/Flatlander.html"&gt;Gil Hamilton series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of his early novels was &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fantasybookspot.com/node/1052"&gt;A Gift from Earth&lt;/a&gt;. Not great, but I liked some of the ideas in it, particularly the way in which the gift itself meant the end of capital punishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cordwainer Smith wrote a story called &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Planet_Named_Shayol"&gt;A Planet Named Shayol&lt;/a&gt; Criminals are sent to a planet where they live forever, but they grow extra organs which are harvested from them &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; while they are under the effects of a powerful narcotic. I love this story, but I am at a loss to understand why.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;There is an inalienable right to a person's body, and, as with the rest of human society, you have to give your consent before you can start being used as a Mr. Potato Head.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The death penalty isn't meant to be a deterrent or a kind of irony, it's meant to be "You've become a risk to society, and the result is that you're going to be removed from it".&amp;nbsp; This penalty does not remove the right to keeping your organs where they are.&amp;nbsp; You don't kill someone for the advantage of harvesting their organs, you kill them as a consequence to their actions, the sentence is not "You shall be hung from the neck until you are dead, and then your organs shall be removed and sold to high profile individuals". &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Since they are &lt;EM&gt;your&lt;/EM&gt; organs, it's up to &lt;EM&gt;you&lt;/EM&gt; whether or not they can be removed and donated after death, it's not up to the prison or the government.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

This way they are removed from society AND also benefit it. What does a dead person care about what happens to their organs?&amp;nbsp; I mean, your life is being taken, who CARES about a kidney or heart?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And in cases like this, money should not be involved. Any organs should be GIVEN to someone in dire need&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Vlawde_Mcdeth on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;04-19-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;01:17 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>
