    <description>&lt;div&gt;Would there be any way we could get these to stack in 100's please?  When I go to do a batch of AAAA's and have to use over 10k of them it really hurts having them only stack in 20's.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Please, for my sanity and that of others who make AAAA's.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the thread that lead to this change I think Ngreth said they would not stack to 100, and I guess most of us thought, well can he at least change it to 40 or 50 a stack and it will help some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;20 &amp;gt; 25 is so small a change that it hardly matter, and yes I have made many AAAAs and I am also working on spell research so I have a pretty good idea how small this change is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no other single vendor bougth drop that takes this much space and are used in this high quantities that I use, and im fairly high in all TS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The plain fact is, as I have said before.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Unless ordered by one of my bosses to do so, I REFUSE to change stack size for convenience.&amp;nbsp; I am sure some of you will take this as ignoring the concerns of the community, but it is not true.&amp;nbsp; I just disagree that "convenience" is enough of an excuse to break a modicum of reality.&amp;nbsp; While I have no plans at this time to "nerf" things that stack in greater sizes than I think they should, I will continue to go with this reasonable step of reality in stack sizes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I changed this one as far as I am willing to go.&amp;nbsp; They just take up too much space to stack to 50 and fit in a "slot" in a bag.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As for the molds... the same sorta thing.&amp;nbsp; I may eventually make them stack... but it will be very specific.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A breastplate add legs molds&amp;nbsp;are huge.&amp;nbsp; Just one will take up a bag slot (I.E. not stack)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Arms and shoulders - 2&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;gloves, helm, boots, bracers, collar - 5&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The frame for the AAAA is to make a HUGE sized container... therefore only one will fit in a "huge" bag slot.&amp;nbsp; So that will not stack.&amp;nbsp; I will consider some of the other parts stacking in limited amount, but these are large parts... just not many will fit together in a spot.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;AAAA's are a pain to make. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know what?  I like it that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, I really feel like I am making something.  I actually have to put in some labor to make it.  The people who like to complain about tradeskillers overcharging for combines when all they have to do is push a couple buttons have become quiet.  I can charge 10 times my cost in materials, not only because of my high skill, but also for all the time I put in to make the item.  I have done some free ones for friends and guildies..and they tend to be amazed at all the work required(and often tip).   My favorite accomplishment came when the person who wrote the online guide I used to make my first AAAA, bought one from my trader a month or two later.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the subject of bigger bags... people talk about how twelve slot bags would be a great improvement, give much more carrying capacity, and make lots of people happy...and that would be a smaller improvement than making GHS stack to 25.  As someone who was a Jeweler before I was a tinker, I was very happy when GHS changed from not stacking to stacking to 20, stacking to 25 is icing on the cake as far as I am concerned.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

The way its thrown about, one would think tradeskillers are making CoA or better gear from drops from places other than CoA and higher. Its not the case! The last blood augs ARE raid gear. You can only get them in Demi-plane level content or higher expansion content. Bazu augs ARE raid gear. You can only get them in Demi-plane flagging level content or higher. It just so happens that this RAID gear takes tradeskills to make into a wearable form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So stop claiming that tradeskillers are 'making' CoA+ level gear, when its really CoA+ level gear that REQUIRES tradeskills to complete. There is a BIG difference, and thereby a lot more reason for folks to complain about its annoying factors than the quoted statement make it seem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

There is a BIG difference, and thereby a lot more reason for folks to complain about its annoying factors than the quoted statement make it seem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lol, funny you should mention that.  I specifically worded my text because I knew this would be mentioned.  I never said that tradeskillers could obtain anguish+ gear without ever raiding.  I said they could make it.  And you know what?  That's true.  Even still, with just GM armor, GM aug, and a good OoW aug, you can make some very very good gear without ever leaving the bazaar.  Better than almost all gear from PoP and earlier and almost all gear available outside of raids in expansions after.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the link btw. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ceramic Lined Still, an item used solely in Geerlok Fermentation Device would also be awesome if it stacked.  &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=4169"&gt;http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=4169&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But that one is realistically larger and would probably stack  lot less.  I do think that a leather tube could realistically stack if &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=8013"&gt;http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=8013&lt;/a&gt; (Throwing Boulders) do.  And according to lucy, they stack to 100 lol.  And hey, if they are small enough to fit 100 of them in a bag 'slot,' they should be small enough for my gnome rogue to chuck.  That would be some massive damage with deadly aim disc.  If I were a barbarian or vah shir rogue, I'd definately farm the crap outta those things just to try for huge crits.  =)&lt;br&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;The fermentation device it is used to make has the following stats:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1760&amp;amp;menustr=035000000000" target=_blank&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#800000 size=2&gt;Geerlok Fermentation Device&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Slot: PRIMARY&lt;BR&gt;Skill Mod: Brewing 5%&lt;BR&gt;WT: 3.0 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Size:&lt;FONT color=#66ffff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc3333&gt;SMALL&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;Class: ALL&lt;BR&gt;Race: ALL&lt;BR&gt;Slot type 7:empty&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Given the finished product is size 'small,' and hand held, how big can any of the parts be?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Thankfully, we do have an answer to that :)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;&lt;SPAN class=headers&gt;Ceramic Lined Still&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;WT: 0.2 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Size: &lt;FONT color=#ff0099&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TINY&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;Class: ALL&lt;BR&gt;Race: ALL&lt;BR&gt;NPC's sell this at 2p1g&lt;BR&gt;NPC's buy this at (unknown) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The still parts themselves are very lightweight and 'tiny.' That means they fit in even the smallest of containers.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;Keep in mind that stacking does not have to equate to convenional 'designed to stack' criteria... they could merely be available in convenient shipping packaging, ie a smallish box with dividers and/or packing material. I think this is a case of thinking 'inside' the box :P&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;The stats on the tubing are:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT size=3&gt;&lt;SPAN class=headers&gt;Cured Leather Tubing&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;WT: 0.2 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Size: &lt;FONT color=#ff3333&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;TINY&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;Class: ALL&lt;BR&gt;Race: ALL&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Again, these are lightweight and tiny... and in the case of tubing&amp;nbsp;it is usually sold by length anyway... instead of buying precut lengths, when bought in bulk you would buy a spool, and simply measure off what you need as you need it.&amp;nbsp;In other words, such materials normally stack quite well indeed :).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;By the way, going back to the subject of heat sources, and the topic of realism, while I do not mind AAAA's being hard and tedious to make at all,&amp;nbsp;an observation&amp;nbsp;comes to mind.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Why is there no conversion from blocks of HQ ore to blocks of HQ steel? Blocks of HQ ore can be created from large bricks, with no gnomish heat sources required.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Even if the refining process took 9 heat sources (it is 3 for small, 6 for large) it would still be a more efficient combine while still being considably tedious (instead of converting to large bricks of steel, then converting those to blocks, you convert large bricks of ore to blocks, then convert the blocks). Just a thought....&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Presumably the heat sources are used sequentially in any of these combines, since using more at once does not equal a hotter flame, merely a 'faster' one.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could always create a &amp;quot;Large Gnomish Heat Source&amp;quot; to work with the blocks only....  Have each one of them equivalent to the power of 3 Gnomish Heat Sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just an idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
