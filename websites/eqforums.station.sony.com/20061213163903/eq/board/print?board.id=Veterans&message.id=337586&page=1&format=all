				I can't guarantee that all the pathing issues will go away but I'm hoping when we patch out the new pathing file it will at least be a little bit better.<br><div></div>

				<DIV></DIV>I dont find splitpaw to be that good of exp. Though when u end up pulling multiple mobs cause there are more mobs cramped together its hard to single stuff out. So,maybe its me,with revamp they added more mobs in&nbsp;&nbsp;a hightly tightly compact area,and these guys hit hard and fast. So, if u dont have a twinked out tank or a mezzer ur pretty much screwed. Think if they took out some of the mobs it wouldn't be too bad..

				The major issue I've seen with pathing isn't limited to Splitpaw.&nbsp; It's a universal issue with mobs and walls.&nbsp; For example in Greig's End mobs start flipping out when they get close to walls.&nbsp; If I try to tank in a corner and pet push plows a mob into a wall either the mob or the pets suddenly run out into the middle of the room and then path back.&nbsp; The walls also completely block trying to target with the mouse even when over half of the mob is sticking out.&nbsp; If I pull a mob and quick retreat into a corner the mob will almost certainly run around the middle of the room before coming to me.&nbsp; However if I slowly retreat keeping my target close it's less likely to happen.<br><div></div>

				<DIV></DIV>Paw is always good for a laugh.&nbsp; Nothing like fighting 2 mobs (I think it's the water elementals who are unmezzable) when a third adds.&nbsp; Suddenly, you're down to 2 mobs again and as you search frantically for the runaway, half the zone comes to visit.&nbsp; People get used to ignorning assists when not on raids, makes for interesting times..

<P>Is the Ice-glazed collar a hotzone drop? If so, it might need a little tuning. I had one drop while soloing near the zone-in, I was going to run an alt over to loot, but then realized he had better from the fairy monster mission.</P>
<P>Considering the difference in difficulty between the fairy MM and grinding in paw, perhaps something more in the 130-140ish hp range would make sense (considering that the WoS random zonewide was 120 hp).</P>
