</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>I assume the best wizard will have about 3500hps with buffs. How do you plan to keep all these wizards alive when Trakanon casts poison breath: AE 1200 damage and Trakanon touch&nbsp;that the casting increases&nbsp;with the amount of people you have so the more you have the more that will be teleported away from the fight. Then his nice little 1500 instant life tap. I predict the tank being teleported and 6 wizards out of 10 dying to his aggro and not to mention the AE killing them all anyways because no one will be able to resist it. However this is just from my point of view, I would never lead a raid to were my guild members would be on a nice long CR. I am not one of those people who's like: " Hey we failed 10 times but finally beat him.!" Ha ha least beat him the first time!
