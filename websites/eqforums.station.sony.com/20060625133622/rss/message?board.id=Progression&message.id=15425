&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I can sum up in one minute what it took that guy an hour to write out:&amp;nbsp; I am judging myself by other peoples standards and actions, therefore I do not like EverQuest.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;-OR-&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;EverQuest is not what I expected, therefore I do not like it.&amp;nbsp; (which is usually the case when someone doesn't like something)&amp;nbsp; It's not the games fault or Dreamweavers, it's just life.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;That said, instances ruined the game.&amp;nbsp; I grew to love world content and then Sony completely removed competition and guild relations by instancing 75% or more of the game.&amp;nbsp; Thanks Furor.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Unsure what you are trying to prove either, the underlying isue here is human nature. You get any group of people into a single environment and you will get a difference of opinion, on March 16, 1999 the first few hundred that logged into the game had the first few hundred opinions, where they the same? doubt it, some hated it right off the bat, some loved it right off the bat, some detested it, all that pdf's shows is one person's opinion period.</description>

      <description>The most excellent part of this guys entire 6 page documentary on how everquest is "broken" is that you arrive at 2 conclusions, either you instance content until you're no longer playing a MMORPG and the game is just a giant pile of crap or you turn PvP on so players can kill each other that way there is no arguing over spawns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hell, my high level playing experience was more stressful on a PvE server than Sullon Zek because instead of actual fighting there is just virtual fighting all day thru tells about who gets to kill what mob.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;yeah some of his points might be true: taking longer and longer to get each subsequent level...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;but:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;complaining about over crowding/competition for mobs/zones&amp;nbsp;but also&amp;nbsp;complaing that they are adding more zones is just dumb.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;to be fair there was plenty wrong with the game, but he just seemed a sore loser that the game was popular, and that verrant kept raising the bar to ensure you can keep playing and keep competing...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;(I'm not too sure why they add new zones now :D revamp permafrost so the giants learn how to remove their curse and&amp;nbsp;take control again: would be cool (with lady vox as their prisoner/toy)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I also found it sad that his only measure of people in eq is their gear/level.&amp;nbsp; plenty of very good players aren't max level/gear.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;why am i flaming that old document anyway? i stop now. its 2AM and i am tired :D&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>This is a document outlining everything that is right about EQ even though it is in complaint form.  Sony has dramatically watered down and destroyed EQ.  I am a firm believer that positive emotions cannot be generated by holding things constant.  You need a sense of struggle and a sense of overcoming that struggle in order to feel rewarded.  With no struggle it is just a boring watered down game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everquest used to be king at this, it had a sense of danger in dungeons because you could lose your corpse, clerics were needed to rez, and necros needed to corpse summon.  If you were one of these lucky classes people would beg and plead with you to help out; sometimes making you give in with frustration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The progression server is close to this, but still suffers from so called “improvements” with features such as giving clerics rez at level 10 which waters down the sense of accomplishment, the reward, the positive emotions…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seems like no game developers have actually caught on to this concept, there is watered down game after watered down game.  Vanguard seems like a potential contender, but they seem watered down as well.  For example the classes are balanced; every healer heals as well as well as any other healer, and every tank tanks as well as any other tank and each land mass is supposable the size of a small country in the real world making spawn competition meaningless.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I didnt take the time to read past the first two pages because ive heard it all 100 times before, but the quote from the rep at verant was the #1 reason i left WoW and came back to EQ a few months ago..."It's been showen there is no feeling of accomplishment that comes, for instance, in obtaining and item that everyone else has, or has relativley unrestricted access to.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I was MT for just about every server first kill on my WoW server and had pretty&amp;nbsp;much the first of all the drops as well.&amp;nbsp; Then hurricane Katrina hit and i couldnt log on for about 3 and 1/2 weeks... i came back only to find out that eveyone and their brother had the items i had 3 weeks ago (albiet not all of them but most) and this was at a time i played and raided every single night of the week we&amp;nbsp;still had content to clear mind you.&amp;nbsp; EQ never had that feel for its current expansions IE the last released expsansion material.&amp;nbsp; It usually took 6 or more months before the common population could reach you.&amp;nbsp; IMO this and the combo of LONGGGGGGGG camps are what made EQ such a rewarding game to experiance. =)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>im actually playing the beta server, its been the best experience ive had in EQ in years. is it rough finding cash for the spells early on .. yes. is it nasty that skellies dont drop bone chips when you REALLY need them, yup. but content is **SMURF** well balanced and people (hundreds of them) are having a blast. i've heard NO complaints in zone other than the odd ranger sob story :p&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peoples view maybe tainted with nostalga as you put it, but its being proven it works and a massive population want this AND are enjoying this. personally i wont put too much time into it till it goes Live, i dont have too much time but am loving every minute i get online.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Im a tough customer to please I know this, but i can say if they slapped an excese charge on this server id still play, its THAT good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mosl&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ps. the artist for Nek forest needs a promotion and pay rise.</description>
