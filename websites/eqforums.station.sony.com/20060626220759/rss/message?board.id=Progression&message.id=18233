      <title>Another pvp progressive server?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=17933#M17933</link>
      <description>Was wondering if there are any plans to possibly recreate a sullon zek&#xD;
type server as progressive.&amp;nbsp; I loved the server and have yet to&#xD;
find a game with a similiar rule set.&amp;nbsp; All that was left with zek&#xD;
was a watered down pvp server filled with MQ2 users.&amp;nbsp; And the only&#xD;
people who go out to pvp are those who have pve'd for years and have&#xD;
15K hp and warp on you lol.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
SZ was great fun.&amp;nbsp; Im betting a lot of people who played it would&#xD;
return if another one was made.&amp;nbsp; It kinda sucks that we were&#xD;
forced to leave the hardcore no rules pvp server and forced onto a&#xD;
watered down lvl limit pvp server with rules.&amp;nbsp; I did not level my&#xD;
character 70 lvls and multiple aa to play that.&amp;nbsp; I leveled my&#xD;
character to play on hardcore pvp sullon zek rule set.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
It would be nice to be able to play that again.&amp;nbsp; Even if it&#xD;
involved leveling up all over starting fresh i would do it.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
Besides, any new pvp server is massive fun.&amp;nbsp; There is so much pvp&#xD;
at low levels.&amp;nbsp; The only change i would like to see is to balance&#xD;
the teams a bit better.&amp;nbsp; Dont give 1 team shadowknights who have&#xD;
harm touch and the other team paladins who get lay on hands.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
And a progressive server would help balance the teams from the start as&#xD;
well.&amp;nbsp; The server would progress much slower too because teams&#xD;
would fight each other, they wouldn't want to let the other team&#xD;
advance.&amp;nbsp; And you wouldnt get what happened on sz where evils had&#xD;
kunark to level without any pvp, while good/neutral fought it out over&#xD;
the rest of the world.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
And just would like to see no selos CHORUS (lvl 5 selos fine) for&#xD;
bards, and no bard divine aura if there was a no rules pvp&#xD;
server.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise bards are just WAYYY too overpowered.&amp;nbsp; At&#xD;
least this way it takes skill to shut down a raid as a bard&#xD;
trainer.&amp;nbsp; You would have to weave your songs instead of just&#xD;
playing resist songs with chorus on.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I really would love a new sullon zek server out.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And just&#xD;
think about it.&amp;nbsp; No rules.&amp;nbsp; Soe would just have to put up the&#xD;
server and not even worry about it.&amp;nbsp; (though it would be nice if&#xD;
every server had 1 gm whose main purpose was to go around and try to&#xD;
catch people using MQ2).&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"Just because they make a pvp server doesn't mean you have to play on it."&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Well, that's the problem, isn't it?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Only a very small minority ever did play on the PvP servers.&amp;nbsp; That's why they were condensed into one and the reason why Rallos rules were chosen is because there were more people on Rallos than on any of the other servers. (and hey, I played on Rallos and I had a lot of fun but that's me)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;People keep talking about the success of PvP servers.&amp;nbsp; I've never seen it.&amp;nbsp; Now, true, I started around Velious launch but back then they still had server numbers.&amp;nbsp; Morell-Thule was always a low density server but 99% of the time we were higher than any of the zeks.&amp;nbsp; There may have been an hour in prime time every now and then when maybe one of the zeks had more than us but that was it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;When numbers were taken away but the servers could still be ranked by population, Sullon was ALWAYS the lowest density server.&amp;nbsp; That's right, the number 1 slot was the smallest population of all the servers.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I understand the desire to have a new PvP server, really I do.&amp;nbsp; But many of us (including, I think SOE people) need some proof of the viability of the server before they open it.&amp;nbsp; The best chance of that is to get people to come back and go red on Combine.&amp;nbsp; Other proponents of PvP server say that people won't spend money for things they don't want (ie, going red on a blue server).&amp;nbsp; I don't look at it that way, I see it as a way to invest in something I want.&amp;nbsp; It is $20 for a Titanium pack and a free month.&amp;nbsp; It's $15 to reactivate an account.&amp;nbsp; Heck, our household non-eq but related expenses are more than that.&amp;nbsp; Subscribe to Allakhazam here, throw some money to EQTraders, this and that and the other thing.&amp;nbsp; I donated $35 to Wikipedia because one day when i was looking up they had a polite little message.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;$15-20 for something you believe in is nothing.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Sullon might have been the lowest population.&amp;nbsp; But most of the&#xD;
sullon zekers canceled their account when the merge happened.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
Maybe not right away but eventually they did.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
When they merged all the pvp servers there was like 500 people in pok&#xD;
and bazaar, insane amount.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; But because of the change of&#xD;
rule set that they were forced to play, they either xfered off to blue&#xD;
(only option to play their time invested char that they could semi&#xD;
enjoy) or they quit.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Pvp servers could have a lot more success if they would only do&#xD;
something to hackers, try to catch them at least.&amp;nbsp; Heck just hire&#xD;
some guy pay him $10 an hour to play video games and try to catch&#xD;
people hacking.&amp;nbsp; Give him a small bonus for every person caught in&#xD;
the act of hacking.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
And heck pvp server is free money.&amp;nbsp; Im sure even on sullon zek&#xD;
they had more than enough people to cover server cost.&amp;nbsp; Why would&#xD;
they not want to have a bunch of pvp'rs reactivate accounts to play the&#xD;
eq pvp they enjoyed?&amp;nbsp; And with wow there are even more pvp'rs out&#xD;
than there used to be.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Besides, low population servers owned.&amp;nbsp; There wasn't a ton of&#xD;
competition for raid mobs.&amp;nbsp; Except for ones like king tormax who&#xD;
was heavily contested by all teams cause of his droppable loot&#xD;
lol.&amp;nbsp; And when one team wanted to advance and kill a mob another&#xD;
team had on farm status, then lots of pvp occured and it was fun.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Actualy you can be pretty sure that the cost of an extra server wouldnt be covered by the low amount of PvP players plaything there (anyhow, SoE is all about $$, so it would need to be profitable, not just break even), or else they would have already made one.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And im pretty certain someone at SoE whips out a nice chart of how PvP server populations sharply&amp;nbsp;decline after a new server comes up to quell any staff requests for a new PvP server.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Actualy i play DAoC right now, a game that was designed&amp;nbsp;with PvP in mind.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;A) As a whole, populations in that game are declining &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;B) Its unrestricted PvP server is almost completely dead as well&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Anyone not biast &lt;STRONG&gt;TWORDS&lt;/STRONG&gt; PvP can see that as a long term venture, PvP doesnt work in MMORPGs,&amp;nbsp; at least not in ones designed for PvE and with a monthly fee.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>DAoC was hardly designed with PvP in mind.&amp;nbsp; Aside from New Frontiers and Battlegrounds players cannot enter other players hunting grounds.&amp;nbsp; Also, the unrestricted server was just done retardedly.&amp;nbsp; The only reason PvP dies in an MMORPG is when compromises arise that remove the hostilities and challenges players used to face, and that softens them up.&amp;nbsp; In my opinion EQ's PvP was hurt dramatically by a lack of support from the administration as well as the introduction and eventual prevalence of instanced areas for raiding.&amp;nbsp; Sullon Zek was actually still quite fun up until OoW even with heavy instancing in GoD because in GoD there were bottleneck areas where PvP flourished in the high end even if it was no longer possible to interrupt real raiding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;No, DAoCs PvP server died BECAUSE of&amp;nbsp;a lack of&amp;nbsp;restrictions....lvl 50s camping the lvl 10 areas, killing them instantly, people using radar to track down people in whatever hunting spots they went to, people following others into instances and killing them while they engaged an NPC.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;PvP servers die because people get sick of getting trained or PKed everytime some kid doesnt like what they doing.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;You think when people raid and some idiot trains them, ruining hours of prep time, they go "Boy howdie, that was fun!"&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Get a clue.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;(ohh and BTW, if anyone wants to see the same pointless, waste of space, arguments for a classic PvP server, go search the DAoC VN boards, the arguments are almost EXACTLY the same)&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;If not now atleast give us a definite yes or no to wether it will be released, and if yes give atleast the month/timeframe it will be released in because it would be such&amp;nbsp;a waste of time to play on a PvE prog. server thinking that a PvP one wouldnt be released sometime in the near future.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;They wont be adding one, and they wont say they wont add one either, because they know that people like troll and others will start spamming the boards about how SoE hates PvPers and loves the blues and how PvP is the best....etc etc.....sort of like now, except with more whining, more insults, and more often.</description>

The sooner that's accepted, the better off this forum will be.</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;** Edit, the dreaded html-monster ate 1/2 my last post, so here it is in full. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV align=center&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR width="100%" SIZE=2&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And that is exactly whats wrong with you, NOBODY posts on this message board to come argue with some meaningless person named "cougra", I haven't seen a single person that valued anything you had to say red or blue alike, seriously nobody gives a **SMURF** what you have to say.&amp;nbsp; If you think you are going to convince anybody of anything, seek help immediately.&amp;nbsp; We aren't here to talk or convince you of anything much less even entertain your viewpoint because your viewpoint coming out of the gate is negative about everything, whether it be PvP or powergamers or any other of your negative posts.&amp;nbsp; Nobody wants to convert crappy blue players to pvp players or force you to play there just like no sane person wants to drive over to Iran to tell them how cool christianity is.&amp;nbsp; For the 100th time get a life.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV align=center&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR width="100%" SIZE=2&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;While we (the non PvP passionate, or 'crappy blue players' as you put it)&amp;nbsp; are out 'getting a life',&amp;nbsp; may I humbly suggest that the bulk of the for-PVP fan club need to get something else.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;That would be, command of the English language.&amp;nbsp; Such alien concepts as:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Punctuation,&lt;BR&gt;- Paragraphs,&lt;BR&gt;- Use of adjectives, (Positive, Comparative &amp;amp; Superlative versions),&lt;BR&gt;- Correct capitalization,&lt;BR&gt;- Sentence structure (Grammar)&lt;BR&gt;- Duplication of words,&lt;BR&gt;- Vocabulary&lt;BR&gt;- Debating skills,&lt;BR&gt;- Reasoning &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With these new found skills, I believe you may find that your point, when put more eloquently and with sound reasoning, will reach more ears and gain a better reaction than the current method.&amp;nbsp; A method which I believe can be best described as "baying at the moon".&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Currently the signal to noise ratio of the PVP-server argument is very low.&amp;nbsp; Raise it, and you may get a better reaction, both from forum folks, and more importantly, from the developers you are attempting to influence.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Regards&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>In my thread I already proposed a solution on how we can prove it's a worthwhile server before SoE even puts a dime down on making it.&amp;nbsp; I stated that they make a poll that only activated EQ accounts can vote on on these forums and then set a number of players that have to vote YES before they make a No Rules PvP Progressive server.&amp;nbsp; So basically what that means is, if we don't hit our mark then SoE just got $15 per account from however many people activating their accounts just to vote (and there would be a LOT of them).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, if we do hit our mark (and I'm quite confident that we would) SoE would probably bring back a wave of old PvP players who have since moved on to other MMO's.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Perhaps discuss would have been more to your liking?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You see, class? The PVP specimen craves conflict, yet, as witnessed, whenever something does not go its way, it resorts to personal attacks and childish whining. The specimen's inability to grow up and accept that not everything is going to be exactly as he likes and that others will not always share his opinion makes it difficult for him to relate to the majority, thus becoming reclusive and spiteful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That concludes today's lesson. :D</description>
