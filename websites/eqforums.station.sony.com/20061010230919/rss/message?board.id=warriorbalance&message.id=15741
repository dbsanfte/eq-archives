    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Since Frodlin sees it fit to eliminate anyone but warriors from discussing mock on his threads... here's one for the rest of us to discuss the ability and more specifically the warrior requests for what this ability should be. I don't understand the requests being made that quite clearly have no regard whatsoever for balance and are just warriors maneuvering to get every ounce of power out of mock they possibly can. Ideas like proccing every swing for 18 seconds, 1000% procrate mods, assuming group members agro for periods of time, defensive procs that are 3 fold better then what I get in PoR (damage, rune, AND agro where I only get a rune). It's funny that BB and togam have actually been the more moderate, just give us a non timer linked agro ability at a huge endurance cost, in these threads. Do these warriors actually think that these game breaking ideas are going to happen? Hard to say, but I guess they figure if they ask for the moon they might get somewhere near the top of the stratosphere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Azazel420 on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;03-20-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;02:48 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;We upped our requirements. Certain keys and  flags, base hp and  ac total, resist total and certain aa's. You don't have those, you don't get in, unless your a  special case. In that way we pick up fairly well geared people allready.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our loot system is based on LTR %...loot to raid. If you have attended 100 raids in last 30 days and have 1 item in that time your ltr is 1%. If another item drops that you like and you 'raise&amp;quot; on it and have three others also &amp;quot;raise&amp;quot; on it. The officers simply check who has the lowest LTR % and they win. In the case of a tie  they go to 60 day LTR. If still tied they roll off, although thats only happened twice in the 14 months I been there. Full members get first chance to raise then ineligibles/trials. (ineligs are those who attendance drops below a certain %) After that it's apps/bots, then you go to rolls..Rolls don't count to LTR %, unless the roll is a rolloff due to a tiebreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We have geared up app warriors and others in qivic and done pick up raids in Time and the like but thats on our free time, not raid time.  We don't &amp;quot;gear up&amp;quot; certain classes, nor do we play favorites with certain classes during raids. Winning is based purely on who ever has the lowest LTR %. Now yes, the more raids you attend the better your chances because it keeps your ltr down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;SK's have been nerfed over 400 times BB. Your still a better tank on a tank basis in groups you just can't do anything fancy. Your meat and potatos not Pizza and coke, with a movie. Since raid mobs define most brutal these days you won't find single group encounters that have Most brutal because those guys aren't the most brutal the boss is. Kriegers weren't &amp;quot;the most brutal&amp;quot; they barely hit harder than any other mob, the difference at the time was a 1500 hp proc. a double 1500 hit would drop you 3k right off and most people then didn't have more than 7k....Your defensive doesn't work against procs either.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;There are none. Warriors just don't have any flash at the group level. Superstars at raids, just a big lug in groups, loveable though they may be. It isn't that they can't tank anything in groups, it's that they don't have any style doing it. They can't stun, snare, blind, lifetap, cleanse, or sic a pet on it ...The just stand there getting hit while they hack and slash and call it's mother names.</description>

      <description>"Warriors just don't have any flash at the group level."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;u&gt;entire&lt;/u&gt; reason for rolling a Warrior &lt;u&gt;has been removed&lt;/u&gt; from group content. To be honest, all non-raiding Warirors really should re-roll or find another game - Tank Parity (and Knight Spellbook Superiority) has utterly destroyed them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frodlin's semi-right. Massive Knight nerfs ARE called for. But it's not that SoE hesistates to nerf - they've beaten Warriors with the nerf stick up one side of Norrath and down the other. It that they are are out touch, out of ideas, and the real talent is writing another game - one that SoE is getting involved with since the best their people can come up with is killing EQ, writing EQ2, and taking an absolute sure winner - Star Wars and driving it into the ground.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've been told by a number of high level players that they are just treading water waiting for a new game. SoE has ruined this one (subscriber count agrees) but raiding 3 days a week is tolerable until a real game comes along.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;More like thier such super tanks in groups that they become redundant. If a 2 door 4 cylinder cooper gets me where I need to go then I don't really need the huge SUV do I? being the biggest baddest thing on the block is awsome, but lets face it most group content doesn't need superman, just average joe man</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;BB warriors actually do everything you say they are supposed to, generally. Obviously they had to modify things to make the game playable. But your only interested in the game being built around your warrior, the other 15 classes can go take a flying leap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that there are are 15 other classes and they all want to be viable as well. That being the case they are going to compete for jobs, includeding tanking. You don't want the compatition, too bad, your stuck with it. You still have raid bosses...be glad they still have old world thoughts on all 15 other classes progression completely hingeing on one class.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Frodlin considering the fact that your shadowknight calculations include Shadowknights casting at a rate they are simply unable to maintain in a group pace.&amp;nbsp;The &amp;nbsp;parses show the warriors are taking consistently less&amp;nbsp; damage with their two hander set up compared to the sk using a shield.&amp;nbsp; another thing you like to ignore is this gap increases as the mobs hit for more. You also seem to be unaware that your dps is higher than a shadowknights meaning fights&amp;nbsp; are overall shorter. You havent proven Shadowknights&amp;nbsp; re more effective in groups at all. only thing you have done is&amp;nbsp; show that Shadowknights are more efficient groupwise in less viable content. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The Majority of your suggestions and changes to improve this efficiency is to add more scaling to the warrior class as well as&amp;nbsp; lockdown aggro superiority. so you can out aggro. out mitigate out avoid and outdps&amp;nbsp; a shadowknight on full mana burn.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Meanwhile shadowknights&amp;nbsp; tanking tools such as ac ,str,attack ,etc(things that could of been included in our post 65 spellset to scale)&amp;nbsp;were so innefective the devs&amp;nbsp; pretty much&amp;nbsp; scrapped them . &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Shadowknights no longer Weaken mobs like we did. With that being said the post 65 spells did&amp;nbsp; help our tanking and increase our viability&amp;nbsp; but to say theres no appeal or benefit to have a warrior tanking in the group is an outright lie&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tornicade,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You've shown a consistent inability to understand the multiplicative impact of a series of changes, of basic gameplay mechanics (such as below softcap AC) as well as a strong desire to isolate one item which appears to be an &amp;quot;advantage&amp;quot; on the surface, but which when viewed in normal gameplay isn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, you've consistently misrepresented my position on things such as scaling skills and other changes I've recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm no longer interested in discussing these topics with you, until you decide that you are going to think through these things, and represent my positions fairly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Frodlin's right, equivalently geared SK's with decrepit skin have a bit of an advantage in raw tanking capability on a lot of group content.&amp;nbsp; I don't agree with him that it's putting warriors out of business, but downward-scaling abilities for warriors to use in groups should be looked into.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Frodlin wrote &amp;quot;The mission is a complete failure&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then why do you still play and give Sony your gaming dollars for a game you perceived as having failed?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
