It's already about twenty times easier to do *everything* in EQ now than it was before, with PoK, widespread 96% rezzes, and graveyards everywhere.<br><br>And all making everything tradable would do is encourage more bottomfeeding. Right now the only thing standing in the way of total economic collapse is the fact that most things in the medium and high end are no drop.<br><br>I can't help but say "Thank god people like you aren't in charge of the game", but it seems that even so the game just gets easier and duller as the powers that be bow to those who want everything, now, for no effort at all (that's you).
