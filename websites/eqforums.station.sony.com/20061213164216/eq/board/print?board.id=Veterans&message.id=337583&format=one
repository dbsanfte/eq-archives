				Went to 'paw with a 75 druid and monk and we had some fun owning the mobs and PL'ing an alt.  Of course, with a monk pulling and the disparity in levels, it was relatively easy to survive until I healed on a 4-pull.  I died once and had to evac a couple times.<br><br>Pathing and pulling get really hard the further in you go.  Two tanks or some form of crowd control are definitely necessary, and I'm not sure how a group of the appropriate level would fare.
