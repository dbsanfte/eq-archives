				<P>Ashlanne,</P>
<P>"&nbsp;We really appreciate your patience all."</P>
<P>I think you may be mislead in this statement. We are well beyond 'patience'. We have waited 6 months for this repair to come and we still do not see a light at the end of this very long tunnel.</P>
<P>All of the responses I have gotten off these boards and from personal email communications with Brenlo all indicate to me that this bug will not be fixed any time in the near future. This is just simply unacceptable. I think the Beastlord Community as a whole has been very patient and forgiving in this issue, but I think the time has come for Sony to act upon it as we have already moved from patient to frustrated... soon will come anger. I know I personally am getting very disappointed in Sony and angry at the complete lack of any real information from Sony on this matter.</P>
