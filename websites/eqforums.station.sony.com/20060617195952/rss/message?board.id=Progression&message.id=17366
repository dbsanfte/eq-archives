      <description>I think everyone is forgetting the game is 6 years old... I mean, lets be honest here... a ton of people are going to log on initally then remember it is the same game and same grind, and just log off...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This isn't a new game everyone, it is the same old Everquest that was out six years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two servers, NO WAY, PVP server, not happening. Sadly, I think there is going to be one guild that just rips through the content and opens everything really fast, leaving this server basically like Stromm was at release - A new server with all the expansions open.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I just hope that it isn't just Naggy/Vox for Kunark but also: Hate, Fear, Sky - plus a quest. This server should NOT cater to the race raiders, but to the people who really want this server, the classics. Even making some disgustingly huge time sink for those "fast track" people that would make them want to quit seems applicable... they are just going to ruin this server anyway.</description>

      <description>If the demand is so great on Combine (pve) that a second server is required, where is the logic that it should be a pvp server?&amp;nbsp; The conclusion is a second pve server should go live.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I expect the population to drop after a month but I still think there will be more than enough players to keep this server viable for a long time.&amp;nbsp; I would be shocked to see a need for a second server though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Laugh, have you all, any idea how many people reserved a name on the Combine server ? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any idea how many people, reserved a name, just for the hell of it ? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any idea how many people plan on fooling around with a newbie char for a week or less, just to say f**k it, and return to their main server / WoW / Eq2 ? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well then, I find it very amusing demanding a 2nd server announcement, before these questions have even been partially answered...</description>

      <description>No offense but the people in this thread asking for a pvp server sound like normal, decent customers and the people who are making posts against it sound like "the annoying nerdy kid in glasses that tells on you in middle school".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd play on the pvp server.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;perhaps we could do a hardcore, roleplaying, pvp progression server&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;30% tradeskill bonus to crafting while being attacked?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;in my opinion the player base will be too great for one server... wether they add a pvp one in addition to the one pve server, or make a second blue server that is not the point. the player base is going to be too large, this is an expansion hundreds and hundreds of people have been talking about for a few years now and sony is finally doing it and they are doing it right... but to get the maximum number of players it would be in there best interest to make a pvp progression, because if its just blue server they are not gaining any additional people, just spreading out the blue players... where if they make a red server, then everyone who wants a blue server will play and everyone who wants a red server will play.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Apparently you are not aware of the difference between loss of population, and a spread out population. Stromm was, at the time of mergers, the highest population server. It seemed to have fewer people than the start, just because they where spread out over a much larger number of zones/camps. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Apparently you didn't understand what I said so let's try again.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The first few weeks the server was open it was absolute chaos.&amp;nbsp; There were so many people in every zone that the lag was crazy and people were fighting over lvl 1 mobs.&amp;nbsp; During these first few days I made a lot of friends and joined a guild.&amp;nbsp; As the weeks went on there was a massive amount of turnover in my guild with people leaving back to their regular server because they were bored.&amp;nbsp; My friends list shrunk and hardly anybody I grouped with was logging on anymore.&amp;nbsp; Now obviously the zones were not as packed as before and some of this was do to the population spreading out but&amp;nbsp;there were a HUGE amount of people who left the server.&amp;nbsp; If you played on Stromm when it first opened then you were blind if you didn't see this happening.&amp;nbsp; If you didn't play on Stromm when it first opened then you have no clue of what you are talking about.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Is Stromm or has Stromm ever been so over populated that the game was not enjoyable due to overcrowding?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>I wish there was a way to open 2 servers and merge later on down the road if necessary.&amp;nbsp; Why?&amp;nbsp; When EQ1 went live, and 1500-2000 per server, it was PACKED.&amp;nbsp; Now, I can guaruntee there will be MUCH more than 2000 on for launch for this.&amp;nbsp; Will make it easy to get groups but extremely frustrating just to get kills(atleast at a decent pace) the first couple of nights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>I really hope they do come out and announce whether or not they'll open&#xD;
up a PvP progressive server some time soon, since new&#xD;
games/expansions/etc are in the works and they're going to lose a lot&#xD;
of potential customers if they wait too long =[&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>The fact that there have been tons of posts started by the same two or three people in this area, and none of them have gotten so any comment from any Dev's, who are really active in posting on this board, that should be a big hint.  The odds of a PvP server being opened at this time is slim.</description>

      <description>Yeah look at all the posts from the devs promising a second regular server.&amp;nbsp; No way they'd ever do that either.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Also there are like 4 or 5 posts from new people in this thread asking&#xD;
for a PvP server.&amp;nbsp; Hardly the same names over and over (I am an&#xD;
exception I post over and over).&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;EQ is not a PVP game. It was not created in order to be a PVP game. Classes are not balanced in a way that they are equal for PVP play. These are the reasons PVP servers have always been vastly underpopulated and unpopular. The PVP&amp;nbsp;server that's out right now is dead, why the hell would they start another one? It makes absolutely 0 sense. Of COURSE it would be fun for a month or two, but it has no long term viability. I would be totally for another short term Discord server, but another permanent PVP server is a waste. Go post on the PVP server board or something. &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Kirtar you're being completely unreasonable.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Obviously many&#xD;
people do not agree with your sentiments on EQ PvP and find it&#xD;
incredibly enjoyable, and the GMs have actually asked us to post things&#xD;
about a PvP progressive server on THIS board instead of on the PvP&#xD;
boards.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Furthermore, there have been many reasons stated for why a PvP prog&#xD;
server would be far more viable than the current PvP server, and I&#xD;
encourage you to browse through past threads and read up on them if you&#xD;
are not convinced.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, I thank you for your opinion, but&#xD;
respectfully disagree.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I seriously doubt they are going to need a 2nd server.&amp;nbsp; After a few weeks you are going to see a mass exodus of people who back back to WoW or their main on another server because it will either be too boring, too hard, etc.&amp;nbsp; Give it a few weeks and the population will work itself out.&amp;nbsp; The same thing happend on Stromm when it opened.&amp;nbsp; People were fighting over spiderlings in newbie zones but the population dropped a ton after a month or so.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;I seriously doubt they are going to need a 2nd server.&amp;nbsp; After a few weeks you are going to see a mass exodus of people who back back to WoW or their main on another server because it will either be too boring, too hard, etc.&amp;nbsp; Give it a few weeks and the population will work itself out.&amp;nbsp; The same thing happend on Stromm when it opened.&amp;nbsp; People were fighting over spiderlings in newbie zones but the population dropped a ton after a month or so.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;and stromm, despite being the only PvE server NOT merged with another, has the highest population of any server in EQ....</description>

      <description>If they choose to sit, watch and wait to see how The Combine does over a length of time they will just end up catering to more of the crowd that wants to open everything else up first. They will unlock as much as they can on the first server then rush to the 2nd to do the same. Especially when alot of those players are the ones who enjoyed the thrill of the race to 50 and to be the first ones to a raid mob. If a 2nd server was opened within a shorter time period it would only serve to splinter those players apart and causing the same headaches on both servers with less competition for those types of guild and ultimately content would become opened sooner imo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Either choice they make I just hope they say so before the 28th so we can plan accordingly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
