&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0in auto? mso-margin-top-alt: mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; 0pt; **Zowie**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Necromancer - Completely reworked list&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0in auto? mso-margin-top-alt: mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; 0pt; **Zowie**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Willful Death&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Willful Death needs modification to become a viable alternate ability. Currently, Necromancers are relied upon to survive raid wipes and act as backup puller. Willful Death promised to help in these realms. However, in its current state, giving the ability only a 25% chance to fire, it does not deliver.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Necromancers have seen an eroding in their niche as a pulling class steadily with the introduction of new expansions. Monks have a 100% chance to FD though a spell, if resisted, and a 50% chance if not. Bards have fade. Shadowknight’s- the Necromancers hybrid- have a heightened ability to survive due to their higher mitigation, AC, and HP. These constraints have placed Necromancers squarely at the bottom rung of the pulling ladder, through relatively little to no increase in pulling tools. Modification of this AA could change all that.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Necromancers should have the same chance or, at the very least, 100% if resisted and 0% if not. This will increase the Necromancer's chance of surviving a wipe and make them more effective pullers when a monk or bard is not available.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;2. Channeling Mastery&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Contrary to some notions, every Necromancer is damaged quite often, or subject to some form of stun (AE or physical damage). Due to our ability to tap back this damage, it is actually beneficial and helpful for the Necromancer to soak up some damage from time to time, alleviating traditional holy trinity constraints. Necromancers are relied upon to survive raid wipes, pull, and damage, and this ability would tremendously help in this regard.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Other intelligence casters received this AA while Necromancers did not. Like other intelligence casters, Necromancers have very poor defensive skills in the form of AC and Dodge. We need CM to increase the possibility of a successful Death Peace or timely lifetap against mobs that can easily one-round us. CM has the potential to be all intelligence casters' niche for survivability, in the same way a plate tank might consider AC to be their survivability mechanism.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;3. Lowering of DoT resists&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Necromancers are punished more relatively by high mob resists then any other class. Necromancers rely on stacking several DoT lines (poison, magic, fire, disease), and almost constant recasting of various spells within those lines.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;High resists to one or multiple lines of spells in a single encounter regularly render us almost completely ineffective. In addition, the reliance we have on debuffs continually through long-term fights as well as multiple mob short fights, makes high to complete resists a familar sight to high end raiding Necromancers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Increasing the following Damage Over Time spell resist modifiers in this manner would go a long ways towards mitigating this issue:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Dread Pyre, Pyre of Mori, and Night Fire (-100 currently) to -200&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Corath Venom, Chaos Venom, and Blood of Thule (-50 currently) to -100&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Ancient: Curse of Mori, Dark Nightmare, and Horror (-30 currently) to -75&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Grip of Mori and Chaos Plague (-50 currently) to -150&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Desecrating Darkness and Embracing Darkness (-20 currently) to -50&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0in auto? mso-margin-top-alt: mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; 0pt; **Zowie**?MARGIN:&gt;Scaling might not be appropriate in lower level versions of these lines of spells, due to the concept of high resists only coming about in full force since PoP.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Disease also needs additional work. While it is our most efficient line theoretically, it is the most commonly resisted. Many NPC's in raiding and group content are entirely immune to this type of damage. Additionally the low damage return and lack of high end disease spells make these altogether undesirable.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lifetap needs to be restored to the "lure" it once was with a resist check -300 or so, versus the -200 that Soulspike and Ancient Touch of Orshilak currently have. Many encounters in the game currently resist lifetap at an extreme rate (cleric 2.0 for example), making us incapable of even tapping in order to stay alive.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A resist ward might be a method to increase the rate at which our spells land, similar to the wizard's familar. Or, this resist ward like quality could simply be added to our current pet, adding to its limited desirability in raiding situations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The addition of another debuff like we received in Omens of War would only exacerbate this problem, as this would take a spell slot away from the Necromancer that relies on stacking every dot conceivable as fast as possible on creatures to be effective.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;4. Mind Wrack upgrade&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The abundance of mind wrackable mobs in Omens of War and more recent expansions has finally made Necromancers desirable past our ability to damage in grouping situations. MW does not limit the Necromancer to merely providing mana to a group. It is fairly easy for a Necromancer to stack this spell along with their normal dot rotation, while receiving a minor penalty in mana by reallocation. A few changes to this ability and an upgrade that scales with current mana needs will allow this to continue and give us a niche in group and raid situations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Instead of having this spell resisted some of the time, make it unresistible, or with a considerable resist check of -400 chromatic. This will help alleviate the issue of the twitching necromancer, due to the reliability of the MW landing. A MW upgrade will also allow for a phasing out of the twitch line of spells due to better mana returns.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A shared timer between MW and the twitch spells would also make it unlikely for Necromancers to be asked to twitch, though the option would still remain, an idea embraced by much of the community.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some Necromancers have suggested a MGB form of this ability, allowing for a Necromancer form of MGB Paragon. This would especially help in lower tiered raid content where twitch remains important (but not necessary).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Moving MW along with our other short-term necromancer groups buffs to the bard box would help with the people that always have full buffs, and thus allow Necromancers to not have to spam the group asking for removal of excess buffs. This would also fit in with the ideal of the short-term bard box.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;5. Pet haste increase, load time decrease, range of spell increase&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The short duration of pet haste has taken a spell slot from the Necromancer due to its extremely short range, long load time, and low duration. Keeping pet haste on a pet even with duration worn foci is highly difficult, as Necromancers are one of the few classes that did not receive AA’s to increase the duration of beneficial buff casts.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A possible fix for this issue would be increasing the duration of this buff to over an hour, increasing the casting range of the spell to 100 or more, and lowering the loadtime to a few seconds. The recent extremely marginal increase of a few minutes was not enough, and not even noticeable. While this is under review, please include any changes to the mage pets as well- as they suffer with us on this narrow issue.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;6. Lifeburn upgrade&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lifeburn remains a high-risk ability while the damage is minimal. Usage of this puts the Necromancer at 25% life, putting the necro in extreme danger of death by low-life aggro, add creatures in the event, or by Area of Effect spells if the timing is not precisely executed. The damage produced simply often does not coincide with the risk. While lifeburn has scaled in that it hasn't been hardcapped, it has not scaled significantly enough to reflect the dramatic increase in raid encounter's HP and increases in all classes dps.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Halving the re-use timer of the Alternate Advancement Ability and allowing the ability to crit would increase the viability of the ability, through upgraded lifeburn tiers using essentially the same mechanic. This would also give a little more burst dps when possible, as this is the one area the Necromancer cannot currently deliver. One solution would be to tie criticals and worn focus effects to lifeburn, allowing lifeburn to scale as the player does.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Alternatively, allow for a line of Alternate Advancement Points via several expansions that would scale lifeburn. This proposed version would be "capped" in that it could not crit and would be "use at your own peril."&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Kunark: Lifeburn taking 3000hps, dealing 9000 damage&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Planes of Power: Lifeburn taking 6000hps, dealing 18000 damage&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Gates of Discord: Lifeburn taking 9000hps, dealing 27000 damage&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0in auto? mso-margin-top-alt: mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; 0pt; **Zowie**?MARGIN:&gt;Either of the proposed methods would ensure lifeburn becomes more competitive in high end situations, while keeping in tact its high-risk to use.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;7. Pet changes&lt;/B&gt; (fix bugs, increase IQ, adjust for raid content)&lt;BR&gt;Pets need a tweaking in many aspects, which is a shared item between classes. Here I will outline some of the universal and class specific issues the pet faces, and what is needed to fix the most basic issues with ownership. This is the critical doorway for making pets become more universal in use, instead of situational and rare in the raiding environment especially.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Interface Overhaul&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;All pet commands from prior expansions need to be added to the pet window. This is crucial for casters due to the fact that we are constantly casting something, and pet hotkeys manually made from the alternate advancement window are not usable during casting. The commands we would like to see added to the window are: suspend minion, replenish companion, pet hold, pet feign, and pet focus.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Simplify Pet Commands Via Triggerable Pet Hold Mode&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Pet hold should be a triggerable "mode" instead of demanding a hotkey after every battle to ensure proper control. While on "hold" these pets shouldn't accrue an aggro list making spamming of "pet back off" hotkey necessary.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Adjustment For Raid Content&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Pets need to be boosted in such a way to allow their use on raids without overpowering them for soloing or grouping content. Some mechanism or perhaps an AA needs to be developed to severely mitigate the effect of AE type effects on pets, otherwise they simply demand too much healing to be of use. A suggestion from the community has been 90% or more mitigation on these AE type of effects so long as the pet is not at the top of the aggro list. This wouldn't overpower our pets. Pets shouldn't be able to OT during raids, but they shouldn't be worthless on every fight with an AE, or AE rampage. This is literally the dramatic type of overhaul our pets would need to be viable in a raiding environment, as most any AE rampage or AE type spells since PoP have had the potential to one round our pets, and pet rune type spells simply don't protect the pet long enough to resolve this issue.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Intelligent Pets!&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Make our rogue pets automatically attack their enemies from behind. Our best pet for several expansions has been a rogue type. If not placed precisely at the back of the creature, his damage is more then halved.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Necromancer Class Specific Issue- Pet Feign Alternate Advancement Ability Bug&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The pet feign alternate advancement ability does not wipe an aggro list. The caster should receive a message after two minutes indicating that the pet no longer has aggro, similar to our own message.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;8. Parity of DoT Crits&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just like Wizards happen to be specialists in, and undisputed masters of Direct Damage type spells, so do Necromancers feel that they should fill the same role for Damage over Time spells. Necromancers feel they should receive specialization in damage over time spells through an exlusive AA line, I.E. an Affliction Mastery of sorts allowing for a higher chance to crit relative to other classes. While other classes use dots on occasion, it remains the Necromancers sole occupation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;9. Cosmetic changes&lt;/B&gt; (different lich model, different pet, new horse)&lt;BR&gt;While a new look does not add any help to our damaging bottom line, it sure adds a whole new level of enjoyment!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;While liched, necromancers cannot receive illusions from clickies or from enchanters. This limits our ability to roleplay, as it is imperitive our class remains liched at all times, being we are balanced around that spell. The community would like at minimum to see a new lich that doesn't look like clicky items easilly obtainable by any player, or a lich that shows gear displayed anatomically correct over our bones. The most popular idea endorsed would be an "illusionless lich" with the exact same attributes as our current versions, allowing for us to change our look with the rest of the players.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With so many cool models spanning from PoP to DoDH, a new pet that looks representative of this amazing content would go a long way to rekindle our status as Masters of the Undead. A "monster summoning" type spell for undeads would be an amazing way to continue the incredible legacy of WTD. At minimum, finding a muzzle for our current spectre muzzle would win appreciation in many circles as it would allow many players to turn sound on once again.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Masters of the Undead should have downright scary minions they ride from place to place. A line of aa, or a quest involving the receiving of such a new mount would be fitting, and in this possibility it should be shared with other evil classes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;10. Screaming Terror Upgrade&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A new mez spell will let us keep rare and vital group utility that we had with Screaming Terror. An upgraded version would not threaten game balance. Coded to work less reliably and for a shorter duration then the traditional mezmerize, it would help the necromancer step up when demanded or traditional CC not handy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For example two versions could be implemented:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Haunting Terror: Level 65 spell that works to level 68, with a modifier of -10, a recast time of 3seconds, 1% chance to memblur, and a duration of 5 ticks&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Night's Terror: Level 70 spell that works to level 73, with a modifier of -10, a recast time of 3seconds, 1% chance to memblur, and a duration of 5 ticks&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0in auto? mso-margin-top-alt: mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; 0pt; **Zowie**?MARGIN:&gt;This line should have new versions readilly available if/when the level cap is raised.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0in auto? mso-margin-top-alt: mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; 0pt; **Zowie**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Necromancer - Completely reworked list&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0in auto? mso-margin-top-alt: mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; 0pt; **Zowie**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Willful Death&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Willful Death needs modification to become a viable alternate ability. Currently, Necromancers are relied upon to survive raid wipes and act as backup puller. Willful Death promised to help in these realms. However, in its current state, giving the ability only a 25% chance to fire, it does not deliver.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Necromancers have seen an eroding in their niche as a pulling class steadily with the introduction of new expansions. Monks have a 100% chance to FD though a spell, if resisted, and a 50% chance if not. Bards have fade. Shadowknight’s- the Necromancers hybrid- have a heightened ability to survive due to their higher mitigation, AC, and HP. These constraints have placed Necromancers squarely at the bottom rung of the pulling ladder, through relatively little to no increase in pulling tools. Modification of this AA could change all that.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Necromancers should have the same chance or, at the very least, 100% if resisted and 0% if not. This will increase the Necromancer's chance of surviving a wipe and make them more effective pullers when a monk or bard is not available.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;2. Channeling Mastery&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Contrary to some notions, every Necromancer is damaged quite often, or subject to some form of stun (AE or physical damage). Due to our ability to tap back this damage, it is actually beneficial and helpful for the Necromancer to soak up some damage from time to time, alleviating traditional holy trinity constraints. Necromancers are relied upon to survive raid wipes, pull, and damage, and this ability would tremendously help in this regard.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Other intelligence casters received this AA while Necromancers did not. Like other intelligence casters, Necromancers have very poor defensive skills in the form of AC and Dodge. We need CM to increase the possibility of a successful Death Peace or timely lifetap against mobs that can easily one-round us. CM has the potential to be all intelligence casters' niche for survivability, in the same way a plate tank might consider AC to be their survivability mechanism.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;3. Lowering of DoT resists&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Necromancers are punished more relatively by high mob resists then any other class. Necromancers rely on stacking several DoT lines (poison, magic, fire, disease), and almost constant recasting of various spells within those lines.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;High resists to one or multiple lines of spells in a single encounter regularly render us almost completely ineffective. In addition, the reliance we have on debuffs continually through long-term fights as well as multiple mob short fights, makes high to complete resists a familar sight to high end raiding Necromancers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Increasing the following Damage Over Time spell resist modifiers in this manner would go a long ways towards mitigating this issue:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Dread Pyre, Pyre of Mori, and Night Fire (-100 currently) to -200&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Corath Venom, Chaos Venom, and Blood of Thule (-50 currently) to -100&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Ancient: Curse of Mori, Dark Nightmare, and Horror (-30 currently) to -75&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Grip of Mori and Chaos Plague (-50 currently) to -150&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Desecrating Darkness and Embracing Darkness (-20 currently) to -50&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0in auto? mso-margin-top-alt: mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; 0pt; **Zowie**?MARGIN:&gt;Scaling might not be appropriate in lower level versions of these lines of spells, due to the concept of high resists only coming about in full force since PoP.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Disease also needs additional work. While it is our most efficient line theoretically, it is the most commonly resisted. Many NPC's in raiding and group content are entirely immune to this type of damage. Additionally the low damage return and lack of high end disease spells make these altogether undesirable.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lifetap needs to be restored to the "lure" it once was with a resist check -300 or so, versus the -200 that Soulspike and Ancient Touch of Orshilak currently have. Many encounters in the game currently resist lifetap at an extreme rate (cleric 2.0 for example), making us incapable of even tapping in order to stay alive.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A resist ward might be a method to increase the rate at which our spells land, similar to the wizard's familar. Or, this resist ward like quality could simply be added to our current pet, adding to its limited desirability in raiding situations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The addition of another debuff like we received in Omens of War would only exacerbate this problem, as this would take a spell slot away from the Necromancer that relies on stacking every dot conceivable as fast as possible on creatures to be effective.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;4. Mind Wrack upgrade&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The abundance of mind wrackable mobs in Omens of War and more recent expansions has finally made Necromancers desirable past our ability to damage in grouping situations. MW does not limit the Necromancer to merely providing mana to a group. It is fairly easy for a Necromancer to stack this spell along with their normal dot rotation, while receiving a minor penalty in mana by reallocation. A few changes to this ability and an upgrade that scales with current mana needs will allow this to continue and give us a niche in group and raid situations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Instead of having this spell resisted some of the time, make it unresistible, or with a considerable resist check of -400 chromatic. This will help alleviate the issue of the twitching necromancer, due to the reliability of the MW landing. A MW upgrade will also allow for a phasing out of the twitch line of spells due to better mana returns.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A shared timer between MW and the twitch spells would also make it unlikely for Necromancers to be asked to twitch, though the option would still remain, an idea embraced by much of the community.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some Necromancers have suggested a MGB form of this ability, allowing for a Necromancer form of MGB Paragon. This would especially help in lower tiered raid content where twitch remains important (but not necessary).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Moving MW along with our other short-term necromancer groups buffs to the bard box would help with the people that always have full buffs, and thus allow Necromancers to not have to spam the group asking for removal of excess buffs. This would also fit in with the ideal of the short-term bard box.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;5. Pet haste increase, load time decrease, range of spell increase&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The short duration of pet haste has taken a spell slot from the Necromancer due to its extremely short range, long load time, and low duration. Keeping pet haste on a pet even with duration worn foci is highly difficult, as Necromancers are one of the few classes that did not receive AA’s to increase the duration of beneficial buff casts.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A possible fix for this issue would be increasing the duration of this buff to over an hour, increasing the casting range of the spell to 100 or more, and lowering the loadtime to a few seconds. The recent extremely marginal increase of a few minutes was not enough, and not even noticeable. While this is under review, please include any changes to the mage pets as well- as they suffer with us on this narrow issue.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;6. Lifeburn upgrade&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lifeburn remains a high-risk ability while the damage is minimal. Usage of this puts the Necromancer at 25% life, putting the necro in extreme danger of death by low-life aggro, add creatures in the event, or by Area of Effect spells if the timing is not precisely executed. The damage produced simply often does not coincide with the risk. While lifeburn has scaled in that it hasn't been hardcapped, it has not scaled significantly enough to reflect the dramatic increase in raid encounter's HP and increases in all classes dps.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Halving the re-use timer of the Alternate Advancement Ability and allowing the ability to crit would increase the viability of the ability, through upgraded lifeburn tiers using essentially the same mechanic. This would also give a little more burst dps when possible, as this is the one area the Necromancer cannot currently deliver. One solution would be to tie criticals and worn focus effects to lifeburn, allowing lifeburn to scale as the player does.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Alternatively, allow for a line of Alternate Advancement Points via several expansions that would scale lifeburn. This proposed version would be "capped" in that it could not crit and would be "use at your own peril."&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Kunark: Lifeburn taking 3000hps, dealing 9000 damage&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Planes of Power: Lifeburn taking 6000hps, dealing 18000 damage&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Gates of Discord: Lifeburn taking 9000hps, dealing 27000 damage&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0in auto? mso-margin-top-alt: mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; 0pt; **Zowie**?MARGIN:&gt;Either of the proposed methods would ensure lifeburn becomes more competitive in high end situations, while keeping in tact its high-risk to use.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;7. Pet changes&lt;/B&gt; (fix bugs, increase IQ, adjust for raid content)&lt;BR&gt;Pets need a tweaking in many aspects, which is a shared item between classes. Here I will outline some of the universal and class specific issues the pet faces, and what is needed to fix the most basic issues with ownership. This is the critical doorway for making pets become more universal in use, instead of situational and rare in the raiding environment especially.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Interface Overhaul&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;All pet commands from prior expansions need to be added to the pet window. This is crucial for casters due to the fact that we are constantly casting something, and pet hotkeys manually made from the alternate advancement window are not usable during casting. The commands we would like to see added to the window are: suspend minion, replenish companion, pet hold, pet feign, and pet focus.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Simplify Pet Commands Via Triggerable Pet Hold Mode&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Pet hold should be a triggerable "mode" instead of demanding a hotkey after every battle to ensure proper control. While on "hold" these pets shouldn't accrue an aggro list making spamming of "pet back off" hotkey necessary.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Adjustment For Raid Content&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Pets need to be boosted in such a way to allow their use on raids without overpowering them for soloing or grouping content. Some mechanism or perhaps an AA needs to be developed to severely mitigate the effect of AE type effects on pets, otherwise they simply demand too much healing to be of use. A suggestion from the community has been 90% or more mitigation on these AE type of effects so long as the pet is not at the top of the aggro list. This wouldn't overpower our pets. Pets shouldn't be able to OT during raids, but they shouldn't be worthless on every fight with an AE, or AE rampage. This is literally the dramatic type of overhaul our pets would need to be viable in a raiding environment, as most any AE rampage or AE type spells since PoP have had the potential to one round our pets, and pet rune type spells simply don't protect the pet long enough to resolve this issue.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Intelligent Pets!&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Make our rogue pets automatically attack their enemies from behind. Our best pet for several expansions has been a rogue type. If not placed precisely at the back of the creature, his damage is more then halved.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Necromancer Class Specific Issue- Pet Feign Alternate Advancement Ability Bug&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The pet feign alternate advancement ability does not wipe an aggro list. The caster should receive a message after two minutes indicating that the pet no longer has aggro, similar to our own message.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;8. Parity of DoT Crits&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just like Wizards happen to be specialists in, and undisputed masters of Direct Damage type spells, so do Necromancers feel that they should fill the same role for Damage over Time spells. Necromancers feel they should receive specialization in damage over time spells through an exlusive AA line, I.E. an Affliction Mastery of sorts allowing for a higher chance to crit relative to other classes. While other classes use dots on occasion, it remains the Necromancers sole occupation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;9. Cosmetic changes&lt;/B&gt; (different lich model, different pet, new horse)&lt;BR&gt;While a new look does not add any help to our damaging bottom line, it sure adds a whole new level of enjoyment!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;While liched, necromancers cannot receive illusions from clickies or from enchanters. This limits our ability to roleplay, as it is imperitive our class remains liched at all times, being we are balanced around that spell. The community would like at minimum to see a new lich that doesn't look like clicky items easilly obtainable by any player, or a lich that shows gear displayed anatomically correct over our bones. The most popular idea endorsed would be an "illusionless lich" with the exact same attributes as our current versions, allowing for us to change our look with the rest of the players.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With so many cool models spanning from PoP to DoDH, a new pet that looks representative of this amazing content would go a long way to rekindle our status as Masters of the Undead. A "monster summoning" type spell for undeads would be an amazing way to continue the incredible legacy of WTD. At minimum, finding a muzzle for our current spectre muzzle would win appreciation in many circles as it would allow many players to turn sound on once again.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Masters of the Undead should have downright scary minions they ride from place to place. A line of aa, or a quest involving the receiving of such a new mount would be fitting, and in this possibility it should be shared with other evil classes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;10. Screaming Terror Upgrade&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A new mez spell will let us keep rare and vital group utility that we had with Screaming Terror. An upgraded version would not threaten game balance. Coded to work less reliably and for a shorter duration then the traditional mezmerize, it would help the necromancer step up when demanded or traditional CC not handy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For example two versions could be implemented:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Haunting Terror: Level 65 spell that works to level 68, with a modifier of -10, a recast time of 3seconds, 1% chance to memblur, and a duration of 5 ticks&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Night's Terror: Level 70 spell that works to level 73, with a modifier of -10, a recast time of 3seconds, 1% chance to memblur, and a duration of 5 ticks&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0in auto? mso-margin-top-alt: mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; 0pt; **Zowie**?MARGIN:&gt;This line should have new versions readilly available if/when the level cap is raised.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#1 - Parity of DoT Crits&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;With Omens of War, the DoT casters got AA to bring them in line with the “non-specialized” DD casters (Mages, Druids etc.) However, just like Wizards happen to be specialists in, and undisputed masters of Direct Damage type spells, so do Necromancers feel that they should fill the same role for Damge over Time spells. Either a clarification that SOE does not feel that Necromancers are specialists in the same way that Wizards are, or address this disparity (an innate chance to crit, and an AA tier that catches Necromancers up to Wizards in terms of % chance to crit). Also the AA Destructive Fury does not currently affect DoT crits, only DD crits. Necromancers feel that either making this AA affect both types of Damage (preferred) or another AA line for DoTs would be appropriate. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#2 - Lowering of DoT resists&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR: red?&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66cc00&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;(Part of the proposed first pass with class re-envisioning posted on EQLive on 3/14/2005)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;In order to attain adequate DPS, DoT spells must be stacked, and in a timely manner (i.e. as close to the start of a fight as possible). Resists can affect Necromancers in 2 ways: &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;DoT spells incur a penalty that is greater than the lost time a DD resist entails, as we lose not only the time / opportunity to stack more DoT spells on (the same as Wiz lose) but also lose time in which our spell takes effect (less ticks elapse) which DD spells do not worry about. In a fight, time means more to a Damage over Time caster than any other equivalent damage dealing class. Many classes have methods to “front-load” their damage (e.g. Kyv Strike line) – shorter fight lengths are a DoT caster’s enemy, not friend. It is a unique challenge for DoT casters that as they improve and progress through content such as Anguish or Tacvi, that the proportion they contribute to a group lessens as their guildmates get extra gear, rather than increases. Their actual contribution may increase (i.e. they generate more DPS), but their DPS gains have the potential to be proportionately less than their guildmates, if the fight shortens to the point where one or more DoT spells are not completing, or are not running long enough to be comparable to swapping that DoT out for a nuke cast, which is the least efficient / effective way Necromancers can deal damage. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Encountering Mobs that are highly resistant to certain types of magic will again affect a class that is DoT dependant more than it would a DD caster or melee for that matter. A DD caster that encounters a mob that is resistant to all but one line can pick the best / most efficient spell of that line and chain cast it, perhaps taking somewhat of a hit in DPS due to it not being his most efficient spell. A DoT caster usually must stack multiple DoTs across several different resist lines in order to attain anywhere near his max DPS. Being forced to stack backwards within the same line of resists has a very large detrimental impact to a DoT caster’s dps, often forcing the caster to go back to spells he had 15 levels below his current level. Solutions to this include making DoT spells innately less resisted than DD spells, (see above, was #5) or to add more resist lines so that necromancers have increased flexibility when choosing lines to stack, such as a new cold resist DoT &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated). &lt;/FONT&gt;Note that this may not be an effective solution as many current mobs are highly resistant to ALL lines except for one.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;Closing thoughts &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The original vision of the way that Damage over Time spells work in game, versus Direct damage spells in many ways does not apply to the way that the game works anymore (especially at high levels / highly geared characters). The shift that occurred during Planes of Power towards shorter nastier fights, with clerics healing faster, wizards nuking harder, rogues stabbing for bigger hits, and mobs hitting like Mac trucks, and dying relatively quickly did some good things for the game. The game is faster paced now. People are less inclined to think of long, boring slog-fest encounters. However, to a certain extent, a baby is being thrown out with the bath water. DoT spells were originally more efficient and more damaging, with the trade off that they took time to take effect. With the time meter shortened so much recently, most DoT spells do not run full duration -- with the notable exception of the horror line, and even that does not always do so -- making them at best equal to, and often less efficient than an equivalent nuke. What keeps Necromancer DPS still very good in group fights is only the fact that we usually have the mana regeneration to spend mana wastefully and flagrantly so. What used to be the downside of DD casters (lack of endurance, they could burst DPS, but lacked ability to sustain that for very long) has been substantially lessened because of huge manapool sizes and the proliferation of mana regeneration, and the reduced duration of any one fight. This is so much the case that mana drains have been placed into many raid level encounters to artificially lower the endurance of all caster types. These manadrains are such that you either must cure yourselves (curing usually done on clerics first, damage casters second) or spend the mana on DPS before the drain removes it for you. Again the efficiency of Damage over time is mitigated by the raid design, and the ability to dump your mana into damage before it’s drained dry has the edge going to DD casters. The entire mechanic of Damage over time, I suspect needs addressing.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#99ff00&gt;Section 2: Necromancer utility &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#3 - All classes need some reason that makes them desirable in a group situation aside from “just” DPS. Historically Necromancers have enjoyed a rather large tool chest of utility spells. Please consider ways of expanding on / keeping the traditional necromancer utility lines. Some suggestions put forward by the community are below, but please do not consider yourselves constrained to, or limited by these ideas. The most popular ideas are in their own # on the top 10 list. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated)&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;- Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Revisit the requirements of Essence Emeralds, or look at the ease of acquiring emeralds given the mature playerbase – Many players are finding it difficult to acquire the emeralds now and are finding themselves forced to create an alt just for the purpose of sacrificing it. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;A component free 93% rez AA that is similar to call to corpse with one use every 72 minutes. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;More options to move / find / summon corpses &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Increased healing capability (some necros miss the health transfer line) &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#4 - An upgrade to the mindwrack line of spells&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;As a side note to this, many necromancers continue to ask for an improvement in the Subversion (mana transfer) line of spells. However this is a very very very controversial subject in the necromancer community. I will however try to cover the rationale behind asking for a better mindwrack spell, and why others continue to ask for improvements to to the Subversion line. Spell costs continue to rise, and necromancers are still being asked to use this line of spells both during raids, and to alleviate downtime. What is ending up happening is that necromancers are spending an inordinate amount of time doing so to the exclusion of their desire to perform their class’s primary role: that of dealing damage. Many necromancers just want a sense of closure to this line, either through making it obsolete through an improvement to mindwrack (the most popular, and hence the request that is put forward) or through an upgrade to the line such that we are not spending long periods of time assisting other characters with their manapool at our expense in both time and effort. (Many have suggested one large transfer with a very very long recast time).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#5 - A new spell added to the screaming terror line, or AA's to make the current screaming terror spell effective on mobs greater than 55, to include current and upcoming content.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; &lt;SPAN **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR: red?&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66cc00&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;(Part of the proposed first pass with class re-envisioning posted on EQLive on 3/14/2005)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Necromancers want to retain their group utility and means of filling in for a variety of classes in a pinch. A new mez spell will let us keep this utility that we did have with Screaming Terror. Necromancers feel in no way that a new spell coded similarly to screaming terror that limits us to 1-2 mobs mezzed intrudes on the core capabilities of enchanters and bards. If a new spell is not in the cards, explore other ways of retaining said utility via AA's or some other mechanism. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#6 - Address the fact that Word of Terris is not effective for a necromancer who solos, or who does not have a class who can debuff the mob in their group&lt;/STRONG&gt;. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;Having a spell line that is completely dependant on outside help from a few specific classes is not characteristic of the Necromancer. While many necros feel that the appropriate adjustment would be specifically to address the MR adjust portion of the spell that was previously reduced from -100 MR to no adjustment, we are leaving the request open for you to consider other solutions to the core issue stated above. Also of note is the lack of undead mobs to charm. For example, of 5 different themes in LDoN, 3 of them are populated with undead, and only 1 theme has undead that are charmable. Also not all instances of that theme have the charmable mob in them. While this is not a class issue, and more a content issue, it deserves mention in this context. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#7 - Improvements to Desecrating Darkness&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There is not much of an improvement to this line that makes it clearly desirable to use over Embracing Darkness. The only difference is a slight increase in DPS, and a corresponding increase in mana cost. A clear reason to consider this spell an upgrade would be one of the following: increased snare %, increased duration, decreased casting time, decreased resist rate. The reason the spell is cast is not for it’s damage component, but for the fact that it is a snare. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#8 - Cosmetic changes (lich illusion / pet model)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated)&amp;nbsp;- Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Players have consistently asked for more means to make themselves individually distinctive. Gnomes looking like gnome skeletons, iksar necromancers having the iksar skeleton model, lich models that allow other players to see other wearable items that the necromancer has equipped (tattered robes, or some sort of particle effect / blur filter or some other method of showing lich). Also requests for a new pet model are very common as previously the different shades of necromancer skeleton were a sort of badge of honor showing how much a necromancer had progressed. Getting away from the pale white skeletons to the brown/red skeletons was a sort of rite of passage.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;#&lt;STRONG&gt;9&lt;/STRONG&gt; -&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pet Upgrades / Pet Focus Scaling&amp;nbsp; &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated)&amp;nbsp;- Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A. Improve overall pet defense / survivability - particularly on raids pets will get killed by AE affects designed to kill melee in the area. AE DoT's that melee have to have cured, the pet often is not. AE rampage, spiky damage that while painful on melee who have 10K-16K buffed hp, will one shot the pet before any group / AE healing can be applied.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;B. Address scaling / focus availability (as noted in re-envisioning notes, this should be forthcoming, but felt this was important enough to necros to mention in top 10). Benefit at the very high end (minion of discord / minion of chaos) seems lacklustre according to many necro posts. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#10 - TBA&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

Ideally this would be resolved by substantially reducing or even eliminating the recast time on Horror, which is already on the list. In light of the above discussion about resists, it must be noted that a resist on this line particularly hurts necromancer DPS, and that the line as a whole is rather heavily resisted. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

While many necros feel that the appropriate adjustment would be specifically to address the MR adjust portion of the spell that was previously reduced from -100 MR to no adjustment, we are leaving the request open for you to consider other solutions to the core issue stated above. Also of note is the lack of undead mobs to charm. For example, of 5 different themes in LDoN, 3 of them are populated with undead, and only 1 theme has undead that are charmable. Also not all instances of that theme have the charmable mob in them. While this is not a class issue, and more a content issue, it deserves mention in this context. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#8 - Improvements to Desecrating Darkness&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There is not much of an improvement to this line that makes it clearly desirable to use over Embracing Darkness. The only difference is a slight increase in DPS, and a corresponding increase in mana cost. A clear reason to consider this spell an upgrade would be one of the following: increased snare %, increased duration, decreased casting time, decreased resist rate. The reason the spell is cast is not for it’s damage component, but for the fact that it is a snare. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#9 - Cosmetic changes (lich illusion / pet model)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated)&amp;nbsp;- Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Players have consistently asked for more means to make themselves individually distinctive. Gnomes looking like gnome skeletons, iksar necromancers having the iksar skeleton model, lich models that allow other players to see other wearable items that the necromancer has equipped (tattered robes, or some sort of particle effect / blur filter or some other method of showing lich). Also requests for a new pet model are very common as previously the different shades of necromancer skeleton were a sort of badge of honor showing how much a necromancer had progressed. Getting away from the pale white skeletons to the brown/red skeletons was a sort of rite of passage.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;#10 -&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pet Upgrades / Pet Focus Scaling &lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;(NEW)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A. Improve overall pet defense / survivability - particularly on raids pets will get killed by AE affects designed to kill melee in the area. AE DoT's that melee have to have cured, the pet often is not. AE rampage, spiky damage that while painful on melee who have 10K-16K buffed hp, will one shot the pet before any group / AE healing can be applied.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;B. Address scaling / focus availability (as noted in re-envisioning notes, this should be forthcoming, but felt this was important enough to necros to mention in top 10). Benefit at the very high end (minion of discord / minion of chaos) seems lacklustre according to many necro posts. &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#1 - Parity of DoT Crits&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;With Omens of War, the DoT casters got AA to bring them in line with the “non-specialized” DD casters (Mages, Druids etc.) However, just like Wizards happen to be specialists in, and undisputed masters of Direct Damage type spells, so do Necromancers feel that they should fill the same role for Damge over Time spells. Either a clarification that SOE does not feel that Necromancers are specialists in the same way that Wizards are, or address this disparity (an innate chance to crit, and an AA tier that catches Necromancers up to Wizards in terms of % chance to crit). Also the AA Destructive Fury does not currently affect DoT crits, only DD crits. Necromancers feel that either making this AA affect both types of Damage (preferred) or another AA line for DoTs would be appropriate. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#2 - Lowering of DoT resists&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN red? **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66cc00&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;(Part of the proposed first pass with class re-envisioning posted on EQLive on 3/14/2005)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;In order to attain adequate DPS, DoT spells must be stacked, and in a timely manner (i.e. as close to the start of a fight as possible). Resists can affect Necromancers in 2 ways: &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;DoT spells incur a penalty that is greater than the lost time a DD resist entails, as we lose not only the time / opportunity to stack more DoT spells on (the same as Wiz lose) but also lose time in which our spell takes effect (less ticks elapse) which DD spells do not worry about. In a fight, time means more to a Damage over Time caster than any other equivalent damage dealing class. Many classes have methods to “front-load” their damage (e.g. Kyv Strike line) – shorter fight lengths are a DoT caster’s enemy, not friend. It is a unique challenge for DoT casters that as they improve and progress through content such as Anguish or Tacvi, that the proportion they contribute to a group lessens as their guildmates get extra gear, rather than increases. Their actual contribution may increase (i.e. they generate more DPS), but their DPS gains have the potential to be proportionately less than their guildmates, if the fight shortens to the point where one or more DoT spells are not completing, or are not running long enough to be comparable to swapping that DoT out for a nuke cast, which is the least efficient / effective way Necromancers can deal damage. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Encountering Mobs that are highly resistant to certain types of magic will again affect a class that is DoT dependant more than it would a DD caster or melee for that matter. A DD caster that encounters a mob that is resistant to all but one line can pick the best / most efficient spell of that line and chain cast it, perhaps taking somewhat of a hit in DPS due to it not being his most efficient spell. A DoT caster usually must stack multiple DoTs across several different resist lines in order to attain anywhere near his max DPS. Being forced to stack backwards within the same line of resists has a very large detrimental impact to a DoT caster’s dps, often forcing the caster to go back to spells he had 15 levels below his current level. Solutions to this include making DoT spells innately less resisted than DD spells, (see above, was #5) or to add more resist lines so that necromancers have increased flexibility when choosing lines to stack, such as a new cold resist DoT &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated). &lt;/FONT&gt;Note that this may not be an effective solution as many current mobs are highly resistant to ALL lines except for one.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#3 - Lower (preferably remove) the recast timer for The Horror line, and revisit the linked timers on the Horror line of spells.&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;The class as a whole depends on the stacking of DoT's, and particularly in encounters where only 1 resist line (magic in this case) lands, stacking DoTs within the same line is often necessary. Ideally this would be resolved by substantially reducing or even eliminating the recast time on Horror, which is already on the list. In light of the above discussion about resists, it must be noted that a resist on this line particularly hurts necromancer DPS, and that the line as a whole is rather heavily resisted. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;U&gt;Closing thoughts &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The original vision of the way that Damage over Time spells work in game, versus Direct damage spells in many ways does not apply to the way that the game works anymore (especially at high levels / highly geared characters). The shift that occurred during Planes of Power towards shorter nastier fights, with clerics healing faster, wizards nuking harder, rogues stabbing for bigger hits, and mobs hitting like Mac trucks, and dying relatively quickly did some good things for the game. The game is faster paced now. People are less inclined to think of long, boring slog-fest encounters. However, to a certain extent, a baby is being thrown out with the bath water. DoT spells were originally more efficient and more damaging, with the trade off that they took time to take effect. With the time meter shortened so much recently, most DoT spells do not run full duration -- with the notable exception of the horror line, and even that does not always do so -- making them at best equal to, and often less efficient than an equivalent nuke. What keeps Necromancer DPS still very good in group fights is only the fact that we usually have the mana regeneration to spend mana wastefully and flagrantly so. What used to be the downside of DD casters (lack of endurance, they could burst DPS, but lacked ability to sustain that for very long) has been substantially lessened because of huge manapool sizes and the proliferation of mana regeneration, and the reduced duration of any one fight. This is so much the case that mana drains have been placed into many raid level encounters to artificially lower the endurance of all caster types. These manadrains are such that you either must cure yourselves (curing usually done on clerics first, damage casters second) or spend the mana on DPS before the drain removes it for you. Again the efficiency of Damage over time is mitigated by the raid design, and the ability to dump your mana into damage before it’s drained dry has the edge going to DD casters. The entire mechanic of Damage over time, I suspect needs addressing.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#4 - All classes need some reason that makes them desirable in a group situation aside from “just” DPS. Historically Necromancers have enjoyed a rather large tool chest of utility spells. Please consider ways of expanding on / keeping the traditional necromancer utility lines. Some suggestions put forward by the community are below, but please do not consider yourselves constrained to, or limited by these ideas. The most popular ideas are in their own # on the top 10 list. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated)&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;- Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Revisit the requirements of Essence Emeralds, or look at the ease of acquiring emeralds given the mature playerbase – Many players are finding it difficult to acquire the emeralds now and are finding themselves forced to create an alt just for the purpose of sacrificing it. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;A component free 93% rez AA that is similar to call to corpse with one use every 72 minutes. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;More options to move / find / summon corpses &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Increased healing capability (some necros miss the health transfer line) &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#5 - An upgrade to the mindwrack line of spells&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;As a side note to this, many necromancers continue to ask for an improvement in the Subversion (mana transfer) line of spells. However this is a very very very controversial subject in the necromancer community. I will however try to cover the rationale behind asking for a better mindwrack spell, and why others continue to ask for improvements to to the Subversion line. Spell costs continue to rise, and necromancers are still being asked to use this line of spells both during raids, and to alleviate downtime. What is ending up happening is that necromancers are spending an inordinate amount of time doing so to the exclusion of their desire to perform their class’s primary role: that of dealing damage. Many necromancers just want a sense of closure to this line, either through making it obsolete through an improvement to mindwrack (the most popular, and hence the request that is put forward) or through an upgrade to the line such that we are not spending long periods of time assisting other characters with their manapool at our expense in both time and effort. (Many have suggested one large transfer with a very very long recast time).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#6 - A new spell added to the screaming terror line, or AA's to make the current screaming terror spell effective on mobs greater than 55, to include current and upcoming content.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; &lt;SPAN red? **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#66cc00&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana size=2&gt;(Part of the proposed first pass with class re-envisioning posted on EQLive on 3/14/2005)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Necromancers want to retain their group utility and means of filling in for a variety of classes in a pinch. A new mez spell will let us keep this utility that we did have with Screaming Terror. Necromancers feel in no way that a new spell coded similarly to screaming terror that limits us to 1-2 mobs mezzed intrudes on the core capabilities of enchanters and bards. If a new spell is not in the cards, explore other ways of retaining said utility via AA's or some other mechanism. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#7 - Address the fact that Word of Terris is not effective for a necromancer who solos, or who does not have a class who can debuff the mob in their group&lt;/STRONG&gt;. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;Having a spell line that is completely dependant on outside help from a few specific classes is not characteristic of the Necromancer.

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#5 - An upgrade to the mindwrack line of spells&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;As a side note to this, many necromancers continue to ask for an improvement in the Subversion (mana transfer) line of spells. However this is a very very very controversial subject in the necromancer community. I will however try to cover the rationale behind asking for a better mindwrack spell, and why others continue to ask for improvements to to the Subversion line. Spell costs continue to rise, and necromancers are still being asked to use this line of spells both during raids, and to alleviate downtime. What is ending up happening is that necromancers are spending an inordinate amount of time doing so to the exclusion of their desire to perform their class’s primary role: that of dealing damage. Many necromancers just want a sense of closure to this line, either through making it obsolete through an improvement to mindwrack (the most popular, and hence the request that is put forward) or through an upgrade to the line such that we are not spending long periods of time assisting other characters with their manapool at our expense in both time and effort. (Many have suggested one large transfer with a very very long recast time).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#6 - A new spell added to the screaming terror line, or AA's to make the current screaming terror spell effective on mobs greater than 55, to include current and upcoming content.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; (Currently being evaluated) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Necromancers want to retain their group utility and means of filling in for a variety of classes in a pinch. A new mez spell will let us keep this utility that we did have with Screaming Terror. Necromancers feel in no way that a new spell coded similarly to screaming terror that limits us to 1-2 mobs mezzed intrudes on the core capabilities of enchanters and bards. If a new spell is not in the cards, explore other ways of retaining said utility via AA's or some other mechanism. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#7 - Address the fact that Word of Terris is not effective for a necromancer who solos, or who does not have a class who can debuff the mob in their group&lt;/STRONG&gt;. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;Having a spell line that is completely dependant on outside help from a few specific classes is not characteristic of the Necromancer. While many necros feel that the appropriate adjustment would be specifically to address the MR adjust portion of the spell that was previously reduced from -100 MR to no adjustment, we are leaving the request open for you to consider other solutions to the core issue stated above. Also of note is the lack of undead mobs to charm. For example, of 5 different themes in LDoN, 3 of them are populated with undead, and only 1 theme has undead that are charmable. Also not all instances of that theme have the charmable mob in them. While this is not a class issue, and more a content issue, it deserves mention in this context. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#8 - Improvements to Desecrating Darkness&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There is not much of an improvement to this line that makes it clearly desirable to use over Embracing Darkness. The only difference is a slight increase in DPS, and a corresponding increase in mana cost. A clear reason to consider this spell an upgrade would be one of the following: increased snare %, increased duration, decreased casting time, decreased resist rate. The reason the spell is cast is not for it’s damage component, but for the fact that it is a snare. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#9 - Cosmetic changes (lich illusion / pet model)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated)&amp;nbsp;- Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Players have consistently asked for more means to make themselves individually distinctive. Gnomes looking like gnome skeletons, iksar necromancers having the iksar skeleton model, lich models that allow other players to see other wearable items that the necromancer has equipped (tattered robes, or some sort of particle effect / blur filter or some other method of showing lich). Also requests for a new pet model are very common as previously the different shades of necromancer skeleton were a sort of badge of honor showing how much a necromancer had progressed. Getting away from the pale white skeletons to the brown/red skeletons was a sort of rite of passage.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#99ff00&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Section 1: DD vs. DoT parity and balance.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#1 - Parity of DoT Crits&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated, was #1) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;With Omens of War, the DoT casters got AA to bring them in line with the “non-specialized” DD casters (Mages, Druids etc.) However, just like Wizards happen to be specialists in, and undisputed masters of Direct Damage type spells, so do Necromancers feel that they should fill the same role for Damge over Time spells. Either a clarification that SOE does not feel that Necromancers are specialists in the same way that Wizards are, or address this disparity (an innate chance to crit, and an AA tier that catches Necromancers up to Wizards in terms of % chance to crit). Also the AA Destructive Fury does not currently affect DoT crits, only DD crits. Necromancers feel that either making this AA affect both types of Damage (preferred) or another AA line for DoTs would be appropriate. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#2 - Lowering of DoT resists&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated, was #5) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;In order to attain adequate DPS, DoT spells must be stacked, and in a timely manner (i.e. as close to the start of a fight as possible). Resists can affect Necromancers in 2 ways: &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;DoT spells incur a penalty that is greater than the lost time a DD resist entails, as we lose not only the time / opportunity to stack more DoT spells on (the same as Wiz lose) but also lose time in which our spell takes effect (less ticks elapse) which DD spells do not worry about. In a fight, time means more to a Damage over Time caster than any other equivalent damage dealing class. Many classes have methods to “front-load” their damage (e.g. Kyv Strike line) – shorter fight lengths are a DoT caster’s enemy, not friend. It is a unique challenge for DoT casters that as they improve and progress through content such as Anguish or Tacvi, that the proportion they contribute to a group lessens as their guildmates get extra gear, rather than increases. Their actual contribution may increase (i.e. they generate more DPS), but their DPS gains have the potential to be proportionately less than their guildmates, if the fight shortens to the point where one or more DoT spells are not completing, or are not running long enough to be comparable to swapping that DoT out for a nuke cast, which is the least efficient / effective way Necromancers can deal damage. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Encountering Mobs that are highly resistant to certain types of magic will again affect a class that is DoT dependant more than it would a DD caster or melee for that matter. A DD caster that encounters a mob that is resistant to all but one line can pick the best / most efficient spell of that line and chain cast it, perhaps taking somewhat of a hit in DPS due to it not being his most efficient spell. A DoT caster usually must stack multiple DoTs across several different resist lines in order to attain anywhere near his max DPS. Being forced to stack backwards within the same line of resists has a very large detrimental impact to a DoT caster’s dps, often forcing the caster to go back to spells he had 15 levels below his current level. Solutions to this include making DoT spells innately less resisted than DD spells, (see above, was #5) or to add more resist lines so that necromancers have increased flexibility when choosing lines to stack, such as a new cold resist DoT &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated, was #9). &lt;/FONT&gt;Note that this may not be an effective solution as many current mobs are highly resistant to ALL lines except for one.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#3 - Lower (preferably remove) the recast timer for The Horror line, and revisit the linked timers on the Horror line of spells.&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated, was #4, and #10) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;The class as a whole depends on the stacking of DoT's, and particularly in encounters where only 1 resist line (magic in this case) lands, stacking DoTs within the same line is often necessary. Ideally this would be resolved by substantially reducing or even eliminating the recast time on Horror, which is already on the list. In light of the above discussion about resists, it must be noted that a resist on this line particularly hurts necromancer DPS, and that the line as a whole is rather heavily resisted. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;U&gt;Closing thoughts &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The original vision of the way that Damage over Time spells work in game, versus Direct damage spells in many ways does not apply to the way that the game works anymore (especially at high levels / highly geared characters). The shift that occurred during Planes of Power towards shorter nastier fights, with clerics healing faster, wizards nuking harder, rogues stabbing for bigger hits, and mobs hitting like Mac trucks, and dying relatively quickly did some good things for the game. The game is faster paced now. People are less inclined to think of long, boring slog-fest encounters. However, to a certain extent, a baby is being thrown out with the bath water. DoT spells were originally more efficient and more damaging, with the trade off that they took time to take effect. With the time meter shortened so much recently, most DoT spells do not run full duration -- with the notable exception of the horror line, and even that does not always do so -- making them at best equal to, and often less efficient than an equivalent nuke. What keeps Necromancer DPS still very good in group fights is only the fact that we usually have the mana regeneration to spend mana wastefully and flagrantly so. What used to be the downside of DD casters (lack of endurance, they could burst DPS, but lacked ability to sustain that for very long) has been substantially lessened because of huge manapool sizes and the proliferation of mana regeneration, and the reduced duration of any one fight. This is so much the case that mana drains have been placed into many raid level encounters to artificially lower the endurance of all caster types. These manadrains are such that you either must cure yourselves (curing usually done on clerics first, damage casters second) or spend the mana on DPS before the drain removes it for you. Again the efficiency of Damage over time is mitigated by the raid design, and the ability to dump your mana into damage before it’s drained dry has the edge going to DD casters. The entire mechanic of Damage over time, I suspect needs addressing.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#4 - All classes need some reason that makes them desirable in a group situation aside from “just” DPS. Historically Necromancers have enjoyed a rather large tool chest of utility spells. Please consider ways of expanding on / keeping the traditional necromancer utility lines. Some suggestions put forward by the community are below, but please do not consider yourselves constrained to, or limited by these ideas. The most popular ideas are in their own # on the top 10 list. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated, was #8 )&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;- Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Revisit the requirements of Essence Emeralds, or look at the ease of acquiring emeralds given the mature playerbase – Many players are finding it difficult to acquire the emeralds now and are finding themselves forced to create an alt just for the purpose of sacrificing it. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;A component free 93% rez AA that is similar to call to corpse with one use every 72 minutes. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;More options to move / find / summon corpses &#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#4 - All classes need some reason that makes them desirable in a group situation aside from “just” DPS. Historically Necromancers have enjoyed a rather large tool chest of utility spells. Please consider ways of expanding on / keeping the traditional necromancer utility lines. Some suggestions put forward by the community are below, but please do not consider yourselves constrained to, or limited by these ideas. The most popular ideas are in their own # on the top 10 list. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated, was #8 )&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;- Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Revisit the requirements of Essence Emeralds, or look at the ease of acquiring emeralds given the mature playerbase – Many players are finding it difficult to acquire the emeralds now and are finding themselves forced to create an alt just for the purpose of sacrificing it. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;A component free 93% rez AA that is similar to call to corpse with one use every 72 minutes. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;More options to move / find / summon corpses &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Increased healing capability (some necros miss the health transfer line) &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#5 - An upgrade to the mindwrack line of spells&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated, was #2) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;As a side note to this, many necromancers continue to ask for an improvement in the Subversion (mana transfer) line of spells. However this is a very very very controversial subject in the necromancer community. I will however try to cover the rationale behind asking for a better mindwrack spell, and why others continue to ask for improvements to to the Subversion line. Spell costs continue to rise, and necromancers are still being asked to use this line of spells both during raids, and to alleviate downtime. What is ending up happening is that necromancers are spending an inordinate amount of time doing so to the exclusion of their desire to perform their class’s primary role: that of dealing damage. Many necromancers just want a sense of closure to this line, either through making it obsolete through an improvement to mindwrack (the most popular, and hence the request that is put forward) or through an upgrade to the line such that we are not spending long periods of time assisting other characters with their manapool at our expense in both time and effort. (Many have suggested one large transfer with a very very long recast time).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#6 - A new spell added to the screaming terror line, or AA's to make the current screaming terror spell effective on mobs greater than 55, to include current and upcoming content.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; (Currently being evaluated) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Necromancers want to retain their group utility and means of filling in for a variety of classes in a pinch. A new mez spell will let us keep this utility that we did have with Screaming Terror. Necromancers feel in no way that a new spell coded similarly to screaming terror that limits us to 1-2 mobs mezzed intrudes on the core capabilities of enchanters and bards. If a new spell is not in the cards, explore other ways of retaining said utility via AA's or some other mechanism. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#7 - Address the fact that Word of Terris is not effective for a necromancer who solos, or who does not have a class who can debuff the mob in their group&lt;/STRONG&gt;. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;Having a spell line that is completely dependant on outside help from a few specific classes is not characteristic of the Necromancer. While many necros feel that the appropriate adjustment would be specifically to address the MR adjust portion of the spell that was previously reduced from -100 MR to no adjustment, we are leaving the request open for you to consider other solutions to the core issue stated above. Also of note is the lack of undead mobs to charm. For example, of 5 different themes in LDoN, 3 of them are populated with undead, and only 1 theme has undead that are charmable. Also not all instances of that theme have the charmable mob in them. While this is not a class issue, and more a content issue, it deserves mention in this context. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#8 - Improvements to Desecrating Darkness&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There is not much of an improvement to this line that makes it clearly desirable to use over Embracing Darkness. The only difference is a slight increase in DPS, and a corresponding increase in mana cost. A clear reason to consider this spell an upgrade would be one of the following: increased snare %, increased duration, decreased casting time, decreased resist rate. The reason the spell is cast is not for it’s damage component, but for the fact that it is a snare. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#9 - Cosmetic changes (lich illusion / pet model)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated)&amp;nbsp;- Most likely this will be considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Players have consistently asked for more means to make themselves individually distinctive. Gnomes looking like gnome skeletons, iksar necromancers having the iksar skeleton model, lich models that allow other players to see other wearable items that the necromancer has equipped (tattered robes, or some sort of particle effect / blur filter or some other method of showing lich). Also requests for a new pet model are very common as previously the different shades of necromancer skeleton were a sort of badge of honor showing how much a necromancer had progressed. Getting away from the pale white skeletons to the brown/red skeletons was a sort of rite of passage.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;#10 - Forthcoming.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#99ff00&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Section 1: DD vs. DoT parity and balance.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#1 - Parity of DoT Crits&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated, was #1) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;With Omens of War, the DoT casters got AA to bring them in line with the “non-specialized” DD casters (Mages, Druids etc.) However, just like Wizards happen to be specialists in, and undisputed masters of Direct Damage type spells, so do Necromancers feel that they should fill the same role for Damge over Time spells. Either a clarification that SOE does not feel that Necromancers are specialists in the same way that Wizards are, or address this disparity (an innate chance to crit, and an AA tier that catches Necromancers up to Wizards in terms of % chance to crit). Also the AA Destructive Fury does not currently affect DoT crits, only DD crits. Necromancers feel that either making this AA affect both types of Damage (preferred) or another AA line for DoTs would be appropriate. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#2 - Lowering of DoT resists&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated, was #5) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;In order to attain adequate DPS, DoT spells must be stacked, and in a timely manner (i.e. as close to the start of a fight as possible). Resists can affect Necromancers in 2 ways: &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;DoT spells incur a penalty that is greater than the lost time a DD resist entails, as we lose not only the time / opportunity to stack more DoT spells on (the same as Wiz lose) but also lose time in which our spell takes effect (less ticks elapse) which DD spells do not worry about. In a fight, time means more to a Damage over Time caster than any other equivalent damage dealing class. Many classes have methods to “front-load” their damage (e.g. Kyv Strike line) – shorter fight lengths are a DoT caster’s enemy, not friend. It is a unique challenge for DoT casters that as they improve and progress through content such as Anguish or Tacvi, that the proportion they contribute to a group lessens as their guildmates get extra gear, rather than increases. Their actual contribution may increase (i.e. they generate more DPS), but their DPS gains have the potential to be proportionately less than their guildmates, if the fight shortens to the point where one or more DoT spells are not completing, or are not running long enough to be comparable to swapping that DoT out for a nuke cast, which is the least efficient / effective way Necromancers can deal damage. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Encountering Mobs that are highly resistant to certain types of magic will again affect a class that is DoT dependant more than it would a DD caster or melee for that matter. A DD caster that encounters a mob that is resistant to all but one line can pick the best / most efficient spell of that line and chain cast it, perhaps taking somewhat of a hit in DPS due to it not being his most efficient spell. A DoT caster usually must stack multiple DoTs across several different resist lines in order to attain anywhere near his max DPS. Being forced to stack backwards within the same line of resists has a very large detrimental impact to a DoT caster’s dps, often forcing the caster to go back to spells he had 15 levels below his current level. Solutions to this include making DoT spells innately less resisted than DD spells, (see above, was #5) or to add more resist lines so that necromancers have increased flexibility when choosing lines to stack, such as a new cold resist DoT &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated, was #9). &lt;/FONT&gt;Note that this may not be an effective solution as many current mobs are highly resistant to ALL lines except for one.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#3 - Lower (preferably remove) the recast timer for The Horror line, and revisit the linked timers on the Horror line of spells.&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(Currently being evaluated, was #4, and #10) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;The class as a whole depends on the stacking of DoT's, and particularly in encounters where only 1 resist line (magic in this case) lands, stacking DoTs within the same line is often necessary. Ideally this would be resolved by substantially reducing or even eliminating the recast time on Horror, which is already on the list. In light of the above discussion about resists, it must be noted that a resist on this line particularly hurts necromancer DPS, and that the line as a whole is rather heavily resisted. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;U&gt;Closing thoughts &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The original vision of the way that Damage over Time spells work in game, versus Direct damage spells in many ways does not apply to the way that the game works anymore (especially at high levels / highly geared characters). The shift that occurred during Planes of Power towards shorter nastier fights, with clerics healing faster, wizards nuking harder, rogues stabbing for bigger hits, and mobs hitting like Mac trucks, and dying relatively quickly did some good things for the game. The game is faster paced now. People are less inclined to think of long, boring slog-fest encounters. However, to a certain extent, a baby is being thrown out with the bath water. DoT spells were originally more efficient and more damaging, with the trade off that they took time to take effect. With the time meter shortened so much recently, most DoT spells do not run full duration -- with the notable exception of the horror line, and even that does not always do so -- making them at best equal to, and often less efficient than an equivalent nuke. What keeps Necromancer DPS still very good in group fights is only the fact that we usually have the mana regeneration to spend mana wastefully and flagrantly so. What used to be the downside of DD casters (lack of endurance, they could burst DPS, but lacked ability to sustain that for very long) has been substantially lessened because of huge manapool sizes and the proliferation of mana regeneration, and the reduced duration of any one fight. This is so much the case that mana drains have been placed into many raid level encounters to artificially lower the endurance of all caster types. These manadrains are such that you either must cure yourselves (curing usually done on clerics first, damage casters second) or spend the mana on DPS before the drain removes it for you. Again the efficiency of Damage over time is mitigated by the raid design, and the ability to dump your mana into damage before it’s drained dry has the edge going to DD casters. The entire mechanic of Damage over time, I suspect needs addressing.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0in 0pt? **Oompa-Loompa**?MARGIN:&gt;10. Revisit the idea of linked casting timers for Horror and Dark Nightmare. The class as a whole depends on the stacking of DoT's, and particularly in encounters where only 1 resist line (magic in this case) lands, stacking DoTs within the same line is often necessary.&amp;nbsp; Ideally this would be resolved by substantially reducing or even eliminating the recast time on Horror, which is already on the list. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;SPAN **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR: red?&gt;(currently being discussed)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR: #cccccc?&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=time_text&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

Many necromancers also would like such a dot to be coded in a way that would further serve to address the problem of short fight durations in GoD fights (we don't see any reason to suspect that this will be changing in Omens).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SPAN **Oompa-Loompa**?COLOR: #cccccc?&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **Oompa-Loompa**?MARGIN:&gt;10. Revisit the idea of linked casting timers for Horror and Dark Nightmare. The class as a whole depends on the stacking of DoT's, and particularly in encounters where only 1 resist line (magic in this case) lands, stacking DoTs within the same line is often necessary.&amp;nbsp; Ideally this would be resolved by substantially reducing or even eliminating the recast time on Horror, which is already on the list.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=time_text&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
