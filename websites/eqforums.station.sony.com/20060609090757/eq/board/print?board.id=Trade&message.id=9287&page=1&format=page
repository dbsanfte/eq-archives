				I posted this under a couple of different thread as a reply, just so the data was where it should be in response to various conversations.  I post it here for anyone who may not read eqtraders.<br><br>Here are my success rates sorted by trivial (been wanting go through this for a while, so now is good):<br><br>All are with mastery 3.  Smithing skill was always 297+.  Tailoring was anywhere from 253 to 296 (yes it's a big gap, but I haven't seen much variation in success which means that I probably hit the cap at or close to 253 + 5% = 265 mod skill).  I have not been using a skill mod item for the past month and have been enjoying good success rates.  Again, most likely due to hitting the caps w/ mastery 3.<br><br>All GM armor/symbols<br>[b]386 Trivial Items (bp & legs)[/b]<br>- smithed bp: 13/21<br>- smithed legs: 12/24<br>- smithed bp sym: 15/25<br>- smithed leg sym: 7/10<br>- tailored bp sym: 24/34<br>- tailored leg sym: 27/41<br><br>armor: 25/45 = 55.6%<br>symbols: 73/110 = 66.4%<br>both: 98/155 = 63.2%<br><br><br>[b]368 Trivial Items (sleeves)[/b]<br>- smithed sleeves: 9/13<br>- smithed sleeve sym: 6/14 (lots of hate for me =)<br>- tailored sleeve sym: 30/36<br><br>armor: 9/13 = 69.2%<br>symbols: 36/50 = 72%<br>both: 45/63 = 71.4%<br><br><br>[b]334 Trivial Items (helm, boots, gloves)[/b]<br>- smithed helm: 7/9<br>- smithed boots: 6/8<br>- smithed gloves: 5/5<br>- smithed helm sym: 5/9<br>- smithed boots sym: 5/7<br>- smithed gloves sym: 2/2<br>- tailored helm sym: 21/24<br>- tailored boots sym: 21/27<br>- tailored gloves sym: 21/22<br><br>armor: 18/22 = 81.8%<br>symbols: 75/91 = 82.4%<br>both: 93/113 = 82.3%<br><br><br>[b]316 Trivial Items (wrists)[/b]<br>- smithed wrists: 11/13<br>- smithed wrist sym: 5/5<br>- tailored wrist sym: 35/40<br><br>armor: 11/13 = 84.6%<br>symbols: 40/45 = 88.9%<br>both: 51/58 = 87.9%<br><br><br>[b]Hypothesis[/b]<br>The success caps on GM armor are:<br>386 trivial items = ~60% (my rate is 63.2% in 155 attempts)<br>368 trivial items = ~70% (my rate is 71.4% in 63 attempts) <br>334 trivial items = ~80% (my rate is 82.3% in 113 attempts)<br>316 trivial items = ~90% (my rate is 87.9% in 58 attempts)<br><br>Interestingly, 250 skill + 5% item + mastery 3 (262 modified) gets one very close to these numbers.

<DIV>I went back and generated numbers for my GM smithing and tailoring.&nbsp; My numbers spread from 250-286 in smithing and 250-266 in tailoring.&nbsp; Further, I merged BP and legs early on, so don't have separate numbers.&nbsp; As you can tell by my data, I focussed on bp/leg symbols.&nbsp; My tailoring is just catching up, and I am using it to make the lower end symbols.&nbsp; My lower end sample sizes are relatively small, especially with bracers.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I accumulated our data at the end, and it appears to support your hypothesis fairly well with the accumulated sample sizes.</DIV>
