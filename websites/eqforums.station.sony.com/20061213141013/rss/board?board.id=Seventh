      <title>The Planar Raiding Organization</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Seventh&amp;message.id=106#M106</link>
      <description>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hello Guys, My name is Liioadin and I am currently unguilded.&amp;nbsp; A very good friend of mine and I have recently started the Planar Raiding Organization which was designed to give a raiding opportunity to small family guilds that have no other means of raid.&amp;nbsp; Guilds that wish to raid but aren't able to because they lack the numbers or the leadership.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have 16 Guilds currently and are seeking more.&amp;nbsp; This number may sound shocking to some but as I stated above we target very small guild that can only bring 1 or 2 raiders a night or sometimes 1 every couple of weeks.&amp;nbsp; Our intention is to allow these guilds to pick up one or two more at a time so that we can at least be getting three consistantly from each guild.&amp;nbsp; And obviously other guilds will bring more than three plus we allow for independants to become members.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are obviously a planar alliance as the name tells.&amp;nbsp; We handle raids and our alliance in a unique way that we feel works very well for us.&amp;nbsp; Our raids aren't about flagging for time, or earning gear.&amp;nbsp; they are about having fun and progressing with a general purpose.&amp;nbsp; Many of our raiders need to learn to raid on a new level and we offer a situation where they can do that, while remaining in their small very comfortable family guild and while earning gear and flags.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have low attendance on raids with our largest being about 35.&amp;nbsp; We are working in the lower tiers of Pop since we are still new and growing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason I am posting is that we are going to continue looking for more small family guilds with at least a few raiders above lvl 46.&amp;nbsp; As well, we are looking for more independant raiders who are interested in working on pop content. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We're still finding our feet but I feel comfortable saying that we offer raids that are entertaining and productive for raiders who either want pop flags they've missed, or wish to begin raiding and don't really know where to start.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We aren't the most uber, We don't know every detail of every zone in pop.&amp;nbsp; But we know what we are doing, and we know what our goals are.&amp;nbsp; And we feel that there is a way to allow people to live their EQ lives in a small guild, with big ambitions, and achieve success.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To clarify, Not all who apply are going to be accepted. If your guild is too large or would be bringing too many people to our raids we will turn you down... A guild like this would likely draw a lot of members out of their current guilds Intentionally or unintentionally.&amp;nbsp; We wish to help the guilds in our alliance build not tear them apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also Independant members can be anyone in any guild outside of the alliance. or in NO guild.&amp;nbsp; Independant members raid with their guilds and attend our raids when possible. I am considered an Independant member under our definition of it and when we go to a more formal style of handling loot, I will have my loot handled as an independant.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also we are all volunteer.&amp;nbsp; If you join us with your guild or as an independant you have no obligation to raid with us whether you are busy or not.&amp;nbsp; You come when you want to.&amp;nbsp; But we ask that when you do come, at that point, you allow us to lead you.&amp;nbsp; Listen to instructions, don't make unnessisary demands of us, and always assist =-).&amp;nbsp; As such, Our website and alliance channel are both voluntary as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our website is http://guildportal.com/Guild.aspx?GuildID=111228&amp;amp;TabID=950256 -- as I said it is voluntary so you will find very few posts on there.&amp;nbsp; Our leadership team uses it for it's forums, other than that it holds lists of our Lead team, current members and independants and that's about it.&amp;nbsp; Occasionally we'll post info on there if the servers are down, otherwise we'll contact an officer in your guild directly and have them distribute the information to their members.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our channel is Raid:Raid and you are all welcome to join it and speak to us as you see fit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have any questions I am typically only online on raid nights.&amp;nbsp; Send me an in-game E-mail if you think you wanna be a part of what we are doing.&amp;nbsp; If not, Have a good day =-).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~Liio&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>The most enjoyable EQ experience, No Retreat is recruiting, all-purpose guild. ALL are welcome!</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Seventh&amp;message.id=101#M101</link>
      <description>Hello. I want to make this short as I know many people do not like reading alot when it comes to "just another guild-recruit message".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I started guild No Retreat on The Sleeper, and was quickly #1 until the power-levelers took over and dominated everything; I quickly got fed-up and moved the guild back home, to Lanys/7th, where my mains where.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Long-Story-Short:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am Yotix, Drakkin Warrior, and I welcome any-&amp;-all to join; regardless of level/AA, class/race, experience &amp; time-zone situation(s).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We DO have a webpage and you are more than welcome to check it out: http://www.no-retreat.net&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We DO have Voice-Chat AND a Forum&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We ARE leader of up-and-coming server-wide guild-alliance, eliminated the tedious LFG-troubles, let alone over-priced gear, quests/raids you cannot do alone or at least in small-numbers, and exclusive lotteries AND events that you will not want to miss (on The Sleeper, I gave 1,000pp to each group-member in top-five groups for scavenger-hunt, as a quick example).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I made this guild to not only bring back the OLD EverQuest experience(s) long-time players like myself enjoy, such as raiding long-dead zones, 10th Ring Wars, actually doing/completing Epic-Quests, and of course, in-game "uber-ness" progression. Also, Role-Play &amp; Lore-Play is highly-encouraged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I did not make this guild so I could be the next leader of the next big uber-guild or any childish activity like that; I made this guild because I know people like myself are outnumbered -- We want to PLAY and EXPERIENCE EQ, not just max-level and AA, then go get uberness loot and PVP in Bazaar and/or FP Arena, bragging and showing-off our flaming-swords.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As stated above, I am a long-time player from basically all-servers, but mainly Fennin &amp; Druzzil (and obviously Lanys/7th), and I was an officer in such guilds as TMO, La'Malla, and for my nearly eight-month (8) stay on StormHammer back when Legends was $39.99/month, in TSR during the "Let's Spam-Kill Quarm" days. I remember getting our Velious-Helms, let alone sets of Kael AC-armour, and I have played EverQuest 1 since Beta-2, when teh Devs. had Mith.Marr Vs. Inny' on the Kithicor Bridge (for an example if anyone remembers those days). I also remember fishing in Ocean of Tears (REMEMBER THAT ZONE!) for Fine Steel gear, and all the NEC pathing-bugs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just giving a quick-history, because I don't want people thinking the opposite of why I made this guild in the 1st-place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More info. is available @ no-retreat.net and you all are more than welcome to check out the website, let alone contact me in-game (/tell Yotix).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I apologize if you consider this a long-post, and I don't mean to spam, but I figured this was the easiest-way to not only recruit members but give others the chance to experience the EverQuest I am trying to resurrect from long-death...if they would like that opportunity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In conclusion, as stated above, I am welcoming everyone, all levels/languages/classes/races/time-zones, as I want everyone and anyone to be able to join if they want...not just so I am your guild-leader, but so we can play EverQuest the way it was MEANT to be, breaking away from the "PL me to L75 in 4 days then let's merc Vex Thal &amp; Time". Yes, we'll do that too, but there is so much more to this land of Norrath than getting a glowing-weapon, or a smoking-shield, and beating an Un-God in the head...then not playing for a month because you're bored of raiding the same zone over. And over...and over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope everyone takes this seriously and doesn't disregard this as another tool trying to make a super-spiffy guild to get uberness and entrance to the EQ Hall of Fame.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you &amp; may God bless. You are more than welcome to contact me, but your best chance is in-game. If you'd like an invite, I will come to you, as I think it's only common-courtesy to do so (unless you're faster than I am, lol).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you once again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~ Yotix, Drakkin Warrior</description>

      <title>Model Upgrade</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Seventh&amp;message.id=99#M99</link>
      <description>Ok sorry in advance if I posted this in the wrong place couldn't figure out where to post it. I was just wondering if a Dev or someone could tell me, if there is any plan to upgrade the models and graphics of game to an EQ2 style (Soga). Maybe if they did for those that wanted to stay with old graphics they could put in a option to stay with old and those who wanted the new could toggle em on. If anyone has heard or if a Dev or someone from SOE get's board and wants to answer this I would much appreciate it. It's just my cat curiousity that makes me wonder about such things. Thank you in advance.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;br&gt;I have been watching the bazaar for some Expert's Stormguard Armor and have only found one piece - Sleeves. Is there any one out there that could make some for me. The sleeves cost me somewhere around 100pp-125pp and I would be willing to pay the same amount for the other pieces (maybe a little more). I am on most nights (except Thursdays) and could buy from your Bazaar vendor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are the pieces I am looking for:&lt;br&gt;Expert's Stormguard Cuirass  - http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=37529&lt;br&gt;Expert's Stormguard Greaves - http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=37531&lt;br&gt;Expert's Stormguard Helm - http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=37532&lt;br&gt;Expert's Stormguard Boots - http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=37528&lt;br&gt;Expert's Stormguard Gloves - http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=37530&lt;br&gt;Expert's Stormguard Armband - http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=37527&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks a lot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=37529"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Recently Ranked #1 Family style guild on The Seventh Hammer server, we welcome you to join us. After recently growing to 390+ members and adding 2 more leaders to the guild, we realize that sheer numbers do not make up a family, but it's the loyalty and the heart behind the Character that moves a family to greatness. We are recruiting all levels and races and you may contact an officer or leader listed below to contact one of us ingame. There is always someone online. Our guild was founded in September 2004 and continues to thrive and grow and prove its worth in every situation. We have helped get guildies, epics, both 1.0 and 1.5 in and out of our alliance, just for the sake of fun. We have leveled several family members to planes status and beyond, hosted many great and wonderful event, and even had a few weddings. One of slogans is &amp;quot;no politics, just fun&amp;quot; and that's what a game should be about. You have politics in your every day life, why put up with it in your free relaxing family time...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So jump on in and give us a yell!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Leader = Blaknight&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Leader = Vishnos&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Leader Whispand&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Officer = Kazeul&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Officer = Dactyl&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Officer Leapinglizerd&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Officer = Graystone&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Officer Xyrexx&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Officer = Tinerdarye&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Or come by our website at &lt;a href="http://mystical-illusions.guildportal.com" target="_blank"&gt;http://mystical-illusions.guildportal.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And &amp;quot;WELCOME HOME&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Seventh&amp;message.id=82#M82</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;I've finally reactivated my everquest account, and I'm starting from scratch by deleting all my old characters. However, I did get some decent items before doing so. My question is, is there still enough lowbie population on seventh to casually level a warrior in groups? If not, I just may have to delete everything and start over on stromm. &amp;gt;.&amp;lt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
