    <description>OK, here comes some constructive criticism...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1)  Go to page 2 for a category, there's no indicator what page you're one.  Make the current page number bold or something&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2)  Ability to sort on any particular column would be nice.  There doesnt seem to be any particular logic to it as it stands at the moment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) make use of XHTML/DHTML.  This one needs some explanation....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clearly your  server is doing a fair bit of work, and to make matters worse it's doing that dotNET on IIS thing where the server really has to work hard.  What you could do is to allow the entire category to be loaded into the browser cache (xml data), and then switch pages/ sort by any column, search for item etc be handled by the browser.  In order to keep the data transfer down to a reasonable size, you need to use one of the fine Free Software XML database in JavaScript implementations out there, so the item names etc are kept in a persistant DB in the local broswer disk cache, whilst the current prices are fetched during the session. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This approach would (1) reduce your total traffic (2) make the webapp much richer and (3) anable proper seperation of content and form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, good luck preventing the IGE scum from polluting your DB - I wish you well.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have&amp;nbsp;developed a&amp;nbsp;new&amp;nbsp;web site http://www.eqprofits.com&amp;nbsp;which is aimed at helping people to make plat in Everquest. It works by analysing prices in the Bazaar and showing how well things sell (or not!) and for how much plat (compared to NPC prices etc). I&amp;nbsp;was wondering if anyone out there could help me test it out.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I would be really grateful for any feedback (good, bad or ugly) - either here or in the 'Contact Us' section of the site.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks in advance :smileyhappy:&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>When I try to upload a 1MB+ log to your site, it gives an error.  The error is different each time...  first I got an error about "the document contains no data" and later I got some asp error page.  (The error said admin should check their log).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BTW, I'm on dialup so it takes a bit to upload these files.  Depending on the size, it can take a few minutes upwards to 20-30 minutes.  Does your site have some kind of timeout on uploads from completing if they take too long or something?  If so, its not dialup friendly.  Actually, its frustrating to upload for a while to only be greeted by an error.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I've extended the timeout to 1 hour so you should be OK to upload now. (It's worth zipping it up first if its a large file).&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you (or anyone else out there) still have problems, drop me a line via the Contact Us section of the site and I'll give you an e-mail address to send direct to.&lt;FONT color=#0000ff size=2&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Grats, dude...&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Now to my response: I have been using EQProfits as one of my primary research sources for weeks already.&amp;nbsp; I must have latched on to it early and I like it a lot.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Great resource, and in fact it is the only site I have found where I can do a reverse lookup to see what recipe a given item is good for under the heading of "Tradeskill recipes which use this item".&amp;nbsp; Not to slam Allah, which is a great site, but this is a premium service on Allah that I can't get to.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Feature Desired: I have been manually selecting search results for your "Top #" lists, pasting them into Word to do some replace operations, then pasting into Notepad to remove table formatting and graphic content, then performing a manual import into Excel, then massaging the data to get it to appear one item per line, etc.&amp;nbsp; Of course&amp;nbsp;I have to copy one page at a time this way.&amp;nbsp; It would be very helpful if you could make the data available either in a simple printer-friendly text format that puts the whole thing on one page for an easy one-item-per-line copy-paste, or even better have a "download in CSV format" button.&amp;nbsp; (Zone info should just tack on to the end of the line, one per comma.)&amp;nbsp; Of course, the main purpose for this is so I can sort by each field within Excel.&amp;nbsp; An on-line sort function would help, but I like to add my own formulas to work with the data.&amp;nbsp; This would also be a partial and easy to implement solution to those want to sort columns on-line, which you said was more difficult.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Bug:&amp;nbsp; On the search window, if I edit my search term and press enter, it repeats my old search.&amp;nbsp; The only way to do a new search is to use the mouse to click on the &amp;lt;Search&amp;gt; button.&amp;nbsp; Very minor irritant, but I thought many items were simply missing from your database until I realized my search terms were simply not being updated.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Personal Preference: Would like for item links to open in a new window instead of in the current window.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Constructive Criticism: I am not a statistician, but what I recall of the topic from school "Computer-Aided Statistics class" is that there are many statistical functions available in most CS development environments that would help you to root out anomalistic data.&amp;nbsp; As a minimum I would go ahead and keep all the data, but truncate the top 10% and the bottom 10% (minimum one data element each unless that would leave you with less than 4 or 5 to process) while performing your analysis functions.&amp;nbsp; In most cases, the out-of-whack transactions will fall in that 20% of the data and will skew the averages if used.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Overall Impression:&amp;nbsp; Frankly, your service is the very thing Allah lacks (other than low user participation in their forums, which is why I come here to the official site).&amp;nbsp; I would probably take the plunge and pay for Allah if your data were integrated into theirs.&amp;nbsp; Obviously, the greater the participation, the greater the accuracy.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Conclusion:&amp;nbsp; As it stands today, EQProfits.com will remain one of my top-3 tools for EverQuest.&amp;nbsp; Since each site has different offerings, I will not attempt to rank them.&amp;nbsp; I generally keep a browser up in the background while I’m playing--with your site on it…&amp;nbsp; But I also keep the other two up.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks for all your hard work.&amp;nbsp; It is appreciated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I know that some of you were keen to have a discussion board included in EQProfits.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I've looked at a number of the options for doing this, but I'm sorry to say, that I don't think it's going to be possible at the moment :smileysad: Although there are several free options out there, they all require quite a bit of work to integrate with the existing site. More to the point, they will take a fair bit of database space, which of course costs money ... which I don't have much of! I'm not saying it will never be, but for now I'm afraid its scratched from the list of enhancements.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Meanwhile, you can always&amp;nbsp;use&amp;nbsp;http://www.eqprofits.com/contact.aspx&amp;nbsp;or this forum to feedback any comments, suggestions, queries or even bugs (:smileysurprised:) &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Maybe adding a catagory on the menu to show zone names, this will open up a listing of the zones and next to it the pph (plat per hour) ratio of that zone? then the user can click the zone for mroe details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That would be something where sorting be a good idea.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;I've added the page you suggested - albeit without sorting which will be coming later. Unfortunately, it highlighted a little bug-let with the loot cash calculations, so for now the page is summarised rather than showing exact figures. I'm working flat out to resolve the issue and should have it fixed in a day or two.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Here is another idea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the My Profits page, add a section that tells you what log files you have uploaded, and the day you uploaded them so people can keep track of their logs and tell when they need to be updated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This could also be put on the Upload section.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;One slight problem ... I don't currently store the&amp;nbsp;names of the log files in the database (I guess I'm trying to be just too economical on that precious database space hehe) ...&amp;nbsp; Would the types of files (standard, bazaar or barter) together with their first &amp;amp; last dates suffice ?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Maybe just the name of the file (dont have to keep the file itself on the DB) followed by the last date you uploaded it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also to help solve the issue with auto-split versus splitting at end...&lt;br&gt;When you autosplit it just says you recieve 6 platinum pieces as your split&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when some1 splits cash with the grp it says...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luddaen shares money with the group.&lt;br&gt;You recieve 2 platinum, 1 gold, 3 silver, and 5 copper as your split.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe when you look threw the files you can look for both those lines... if it says shares money, then the program will exlcude the amount in the calculations.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;OK, you've convinced me I need to include the file names. I'll add it to the list of enhancements :smileyhappy:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;On your other point ... this is some of the stuff I'm working on at the moment to improve the zone stats.&amp;nbsp; To be honest, I hadn't thought people would be very interested in this sort of thing, so hadn't paid that much attention to it .... obviously I was&amp;nbsp;wrong on that point!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There are quite a few other complications with splits which I'm wading through atm - like how to distinguish when you loot your own corpse as opposed to looting some mob or how to determine how much plat was on your corpse when you died! If you have any ideas let me know :smileyhappy:&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>yea there are alot of complications involved with that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One more thing I found. On the edit Profile page it appears the charts are off by 1... the abilities is under the Expansions catagory and the expansions are under the banner on the right (might just be because of my Broser, Mozilia Firefox?)</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;I'm afraid you're right -&amp;nbsp;its your browser ... I have it on my list to look at Firefox but its going to be a while before I have the time :smileyindifferent:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Interesting idea Luddaen! I'll look into that one.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;Grats, dude...&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Now to my response: I have been using EQProfits as one of my primary research sources for weeks already.&amp;nbsp; I must have latched on to it early and I like it a lot.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Great resource, and in fact it is the only site I have found where I can do a reverse lookup to see what recipe a given item is good for under the heading of "Tradeskill recipes which use this item".&amp;nbsp; Not to slam Allah, which is a great site, but this is a premium service on Allah that I can't get to.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Feature Desired: I have been manually selecting search results for your "Top #" lists, pasting them into Word to do some replace operations, then pasting into Notepad to remove table formatting and graphic content, then performing a manual import into Excel, then massaging the data to get it to appear one item per line, etc.&amp;nbsp; Of course&amp;nbsp;I have to copy one page at a time this way.&amp;nbsp; It would be very helpful if you could make the data available either in a simple printer-friendly text format that puts the whole thing on one page for an easy one-item-per-line copy-paste, or even better have a "download in CSV format" button.&amp;nbsp; (Zone info should just tack on to the end of the line, one per comma.)&amp;nbsp; Of course, the main purpose for this is so I can sort by each field within Excel.&amp;nbsp; An on-line sort function would help, but I like to add my own formulas to work with the data.&amp;nbsp; This would also be a partial and easy to implement solution to those want to sort columns on-line, which you said was more difficult.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Bug:&amp;nbsp; On the search window, if I edit my search term and press enter, it repeats my old search.&amp;nbsp; The only way to do a new search is to use the mouse to click on the button.&amp;nbsp; Very minor irritant, but I thought many items were simply missing from your database until I realized my search terms were simply not being updated.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Personal Preference: Would like for item links to open in a new window instead of in the current window.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Constructive Criticism: I am not a statistician, but what I recall of the topic from school "Computer-Aided Statistics class" is that there are many statistical functions available in most CS development environments that would help you to root out anomalistic data.&amp;nbsp; As a minimum I would go ahead and keep all the data, but truncate the top 10% and the bottom 10% (minimum one data element each unless that would leave you with less than 4 or 5 to process) while performing your analysis functions.&amp;nbsp; In most cases, the out-of-whack transactions will fall in that 20% of the data and will skew the averages if used.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Overall Impression:&amp;nbsp; Frankly, your service is the very thing Allah lacks (other than low user participation in their forums, which is why I come here to the official site).&amp;nbsp; I would probably take the plunge and pay for Allah if your data were integrated into theirs.&amp;nbsp; Obviously, the greater the participation, the greater the accuracy.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Conclusion:&amp;nbsp; As it stands today, EQProfits.com will remain one of my top-3 tools for EverQuest.&amp;nbsp; Since each site has different offerings, I will not attempt to rank them.&amp;nbsp; I generally keep a browser up in the background while I’m playing--with your site on it…&amp;nbsp; But I also keep the other two up.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks for all your hard work.&amp;nbsp; It is appreciated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Glad you like it Pebble, thanks for such positive feedback :smileyhappy: Re your specific comments:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;printer-friendly lists&lt;/STRONG&gt; - this one is on my list of enhancements&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;search bug&lt;/STRONG&gt; - many thanks for finding this one! Will fix it asap&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;item links in new window&lt;/STRONG&gt; - the easy way round this is to do right click on the link and select 'Open in new window' from the pop-up menu&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;stats&lt;/STRONG&gt; - you're quite right in that there are a whole load of stats you can use to analyse the data. I did quite a bit of research on this while developing the site and looked at all sorts, from standard deviation to supply/demand curves! In the end I came back to keeping it simple for 2 reasons:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;firstly it is more easily digested by users of the site (standard deviation may give a more 'accurate' score but it doesn't mean much to the average visitor - myself included!&lt;/LI&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;secondly, the greater the analysis, the greater the demands of database size and performance. I simply can't afford to spend more on these at the moment. However, I do keep all the details from all the log files, so that if I ever get sufficient demand to do more statistical analysis&amp;nbsp;I have the raw data to do it with.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Thanks again for your input :smileyhappy:&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;We have an orphan player :smileysurprised:&amp;nbsp; Someone uploaded a log file without logging into the site, so we don't know who the user was.&amp;nbsp; We've processed the file, but obvioiusly can't link the&amp;nbsp;character details to&amp;nbsp;the (unknown) user. I'd hate to think that there's someone out there who can't see their profit details ...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you've uploaded a log file and &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;not&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; received a confirmation email from us, please email webmaster@eqprofits.com&amp;nbsp;with your user name. Please also give the name of the character and server of the log file you uploaded, so that we can identify you and give the orphan a safe home :smileyhappy:&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
