				<DIV>Although I haven't tried the quests "recently" as in the past two months, two months ago I was working on making my bard an honorary Vah Shir.&nbsp; I have done the quests up to the weapon on my Vah Shir Warrior (about 18 months ago), my Vah Shir Rogue (maybe less than a year ago), made Ice an honorary Vah Shir Shaman (after the rogue), and now the bard...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I can tell you definitely as of two months ago the tendons were dropping.&nbsp; Because I was thinking of working with my beast when they dropped but I had no desire to start yet another alt at tailoring, already having two wisdom classes that tailor.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The secret to most of the sonic wolf bane drops is that they really only drop on roughly two mobs in the entire zone at any given time.&nbsp; Don't waste your time with the caves or the beach, you will not get them there.&nbsp; You need the roaming mobs that can be found on/around the hill between the fort/outpost and the caves at the one end of the zone, and the Grimling zone to the second stream bridge (second coming from grimling).&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I've spent considerable time in the Moor, between farming for Shadowscream drops, doing the quests, and having fun with the war.&nbsp; The drops are beyond frustratingly rare, and I can almost guarantee you that it will seem you get more of the other classes drops than your own.&nbsp; By my estimation, you have roughly a 1:6 chance of getting loot you want per kill.&nbsp; That is not to say you will get the drop in six kills, statistics don't work that way, just that each time you kill one, you have that 1:6 chance.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>You will learn the areas where the mobsare, or bring a tracker.&nbsp; I was able to use my ranger to find and quickly kill the mobs and then camp and switch characters (parked in handy location) and still get to the loot in time.&nbsp;&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>But basically, the drop rate sucks.&nbsp; I suggest you do what I have done for the past two years and document/record your success rates/failures, and do feedbac and submissions to the developers corner... </DIV>
