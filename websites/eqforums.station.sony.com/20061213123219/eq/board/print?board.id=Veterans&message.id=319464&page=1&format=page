<P><BR>Hate has not changed one bit--only it's relative value, which never was very high (outside perhaps the raid mobs which would have a OOC timer anyway).&nbsp; Whatever intrigue drew you there in the first place has not changed, so why does the addition of OOC regen to OTHER zones make so much of an impact.</P>

<DIV>Alright.. I felt I had to say something... but this is kind of sad... that people have come to completely avoid some of their FAVORITE places SOLELY because they are forced to the playstyle we had before this out of combat rest system came along... </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Don't get me wrong... I love the new OOC system... but... that is kind of sad... I've played this game since 1999? and every now and then I kind of miss the old days... but I'm still here.. and I still love EverQuest... and I absolutely love TSS... so... you really shouldn't take the OOC system for granted.. and maybe sit there and regen your mana like you used to... or maybe think about how it used to be.. 6+ years ago... when you had to /book to regen mana and your entire screen was covered and you couldn't see a **SMURF** thing... lol </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV>

				There is something to be said for trying to keep zones worth going to in relation to other zones though. I feel that this zone was flagged as a raid zone for the benefit of the progression server, but the devs have already set their stance on this issue, so PoHate will go unused.<br><div></div>

<P>There is nothing logical about that.&nbsp; I mean if they had increased mana regen rates in every exp zone but poh you wouldnt go "oh clearly your still just as good to go to poh".&nbsp; If they had removed HP from every mob in the game but those of PoH you wouldnt tell us how PoH was still just as good.&nbsp; How about this if one day you logged in and it was harder to get mana back in PoH than every other exp zone in the game you wouldnt say PoH was still just as good would you?&nbsp; Thats pretty much what happened...</P>
<P>Its relative.&nbsp; When you retune the ENTIRE exp game and leave off one zone that some people liked to use for some what arbitrary and imprecisely applied reasons you do in fact change plane of hate by virtue of leaving it "old school" while every other zone got "easier small group and solo mode".&nbsp; In the end an inefficient play zone is detirmined by its peers and not by itself.&nbsp; By themselves each zone is perfectly tuned.&nbsp; Relative to others is where they get screwed.</P>

<P><BR>because now all the mobs are grey to green, so there realy is no exp there anymore. and because why would anyone in their right mind go some place that now penalizes them to go there, compared to everything else now? yeah oh sure its no worse then it was before ooc regen, but thats not the point to you all oh so whiners that have to try and whine and call everyone else whiners. was there a penalty for going there pre TSS? nope, notta zero zilch zip, but now there is a masive penalty.</P>
<P>also for sake of arguement i used to bring up all alts through here to level and exp up through to like 55-60ish, why would anyone in their right mind now want to even consider that when you can go anywhere else in the game at that level and not get penalized?</P>

<P>come on bring on the flames you oh so whiners that whine constantly calling everyone whiners. you do know you guys whine more then the people you complain about right? nah probably not, still in denial i take it.</P>

<P>I think that Hate 2.0 is a lot more group oriented than raid.&nbsp; Characters that can fight there for xp can do so very successfully in groups.&nbsp; A counter example would be Anguish or most of the GoD raid zones where a single group attempting to earn xp there would find it extremely difficult unless they were overgeared for the zone.&nbsp; In Hate's original incarnation it was near impossible without a full raid, much like Fear.&nbsp; However, the newer version (which I like much much better....bravo for that revamp) is group oriented with only a few raid targets.&nbsp; In that regard, how is the revamped Hate different from WoS, MPG, Arcstone, Rellic or Sunderock?&nbsp; They all have raid targets but are mostly used by groups hunting for xp, quests&nbsp;and drops.</P>
<P>Considering the loot drops, named PH camps (completely unsuited to a theoretical raid plow) and the mob difficulty against a group of characters at the appropriate level, I think that Hate mobs should have the 30 second cool down timer&nbsp;except for&nbsp;the few raid targets.</P>

<P><BR>The tormax guards should probably be raid flagged.&nbsp; When trying to retroactively flag 7+ years worth of content, some things are invariably going to be missed.&nbsp; Kallis falls into the border area.&nbsp; He's either a very tough single group NPC or a very easy raid one.&nbsp; I erred on the side of the group in this case for two reasons.&nbsp; 1) During Velious I was killing him with a single group.&nbsp; It wasn't easy, but it was doable.&nbsp; 2) When you think Kallis, you don't think raid mob like you do vindi or Tormax.</P>

<P>The argument here seems to be to reduce the trash mobs in Hate/Fear/whatever down to the 30 second timer and only leave the actual raid level mobs be the 5 minute timer.&nbsp; I can certainly understand and appreciate the desire to have that happen, but on the other hand you are using having been able to solo or group in these same zones easily 2 years ago as your argument.</P>
<P>This is 2 years ago when you did not have Out of Combat regen available to you.&nbsp; Granted it would be nice and much easier if you had the 30 second version, but you are already confirming to us that you didn't need it in the first place to solo there.&nbsp; Why do you need it now?</P><p>Message Edited by Edimas on <span class=date_text>11-01-2006</span> <span class=time_text>12:23 PM</span>
