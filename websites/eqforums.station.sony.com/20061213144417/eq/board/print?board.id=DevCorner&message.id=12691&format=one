<div>-------<br>CLASS:&nbsp; Monk<br></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HP:&nbsp;&nbsp; High<br>Mana:&nbsp; Zero<br>Endurance: High<br>AC: Meh.. rather have higher than middle, but we've been stuck with BSTs and DRUs for so long that I've stopped caring.&nbsp; Sad that a velious drop is the highest AC pants for monks.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HP Regen: Meh<br>Mana Regen: Zero<br>Endurance Regen: High<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Strength: Middle<br>Stamina: High<br>Agility: Middle<br>Dexterity: High<br>Charisma: Zero<br>Intelligence:&nbsp; Zero<br>Wisdom:&nbsp; Zero<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cold Resist: <br>Disease Resist: <br>Poison Resist: <br>Magic Resist: <br>Fire Resist:&nbsp; All of them are equally important in my opinion.. and needed high.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Attack: Wish we (as a class) werent capped at the same level other classes were... but as long as its not required (much) to sacrifice other worn mods to reach the cap its not a big deal.<br><br>Delay: Doesnt matter, tho low is good.<br>Damage: High <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br>Range: Really need something long range for pulling.&nbsp; Could be 0 damage, 10 delay... as long as it has a good range.<br> </div>
<div>Haste: Heck, 32% haste is fine since any class that can cast haste can cap that at 100. (maybe not bards, but meh)<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Combat Effects: <br>Shielding: <br>Stun Resist: <br>Strikethrough: <br>Spell Shield: <br>Avoidance: <br>Accuracy: <br>DOT Shielding:&nbsp; All equally important, and high on my list when looking at gear.<br> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Skill Mods: Dont have much of an effect from what I've seen.<br>Click Effects: Overhaste, stacking Resist buffs... basically anything that I've listed as High would be cool if it got a clicky buff <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0><br>Proc Effects: More lifetaps plzkkthxu, especially low resist ones.<br>Worn Effects: Like Imp. Dodge and such?&nbsp; High on my list, definitely.<br>Focus Effects: Zero.&nbsp; The only one in game atm (that I can think of and care about) is the Dragon Fang damage focus.&nbsp; Thats a whole 3 DPS improvement.&nbsp; wuwu.<br>-------</div><br><hr></blockquote><br>This is the viewpoint of an early raiding monk with lots of EQ knowledge.. and I place monks as Pullers &gt; DPS &gt; tanks.&nbsp; Someone else may have entirely different viewpoints.<br></div>
