    <title>Channel Server on Test</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=testupdate&amp;message.id=449</link>
    <description>Sorry for the delay in posting this, but we wanted to let players know&#xD;
that Test server is now exclusively using the Universal Chat system&#xD;
instead of the Channel Server.&amp;nbsp; The live servers will be making&#xD;
this same move once they are patched, and we waited as long as we could&#xD;
before converting Test while still allowing us some lead time to track&#xD;
down any bugs with the conversion.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
All player and system owned channels were moved over to the Universal&#xD;
Chat system, so if you owned a channel you should still own it.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
Also the usage of the channels has remained the same so you shouldn't&#xD;
notice any difference on your end.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Currently there is a known issue with auto-joining channels in the new&#xD;
system.&amp;nbsp; We are looking into this and hope to have it resolved&#xD;
soon.&amp;nbsp; Please bug report any problems you encounter with using&#xD;
channels in the new system&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
