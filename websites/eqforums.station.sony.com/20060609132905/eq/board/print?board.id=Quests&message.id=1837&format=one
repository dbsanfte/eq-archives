				<DIV>Does nobody at SOE care about the slipgear gem?&nbsp; I've been patient.&nbsp; I've submitted in game bugs and a petition.&nbsp; I've posted on these forums.&nbsp; When is my issue going to get some recognition?&nbsp; The patch on the 16th of September to 'fix' slipgear gems actually broke them for anyone who obtained theirs before the 16th and finished any number of tasks prior to the patch.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Also, not so much of a broken task, but is there any possibility of incorporating a flag with obtaining an adventurer's stone?&nbsp; Moreso recently since slipgear came to town, an adventurers stone is solely for travel via magus.&nbsp; Is there any way you can make it so that you don't need the stone on your person, or even better, not even on your account, to travel via magus?</DIV>
