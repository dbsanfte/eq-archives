      <title>Test Server Update - 6/21/06</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=testupdate&amp;message.id=450#M450</link>
      <description>It's been a while since I've summarized the major changes to Test so here's a brief list of some of the more significant &lt;font color="#cc0000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;CODE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; changes that have gone to test lately. Note: Not design data, ie nothing related to item stats, spells or events.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The usual disclaimers apply: This code is on Test, not Live, there is no promise of this going to live servers, these may only be relevant to test server, etc etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The goal of these posts is to help players on Test know what has been going on with the code so they can try to find bugs in the changes if they are so inclined. If you do find bugs, please do /bug them. We do read the bug reports, every day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The advanced display options window now has an option to enable streaming of textures for visible equipment (the equipment you weild or wear). This saves a good chunk of memory when enabled. Different systems may incur varying degrees of framerate hitch when loads occur and the current settings are to load only one texture per frame (this will likely be tuned over the next couple days). Note that if many textures are required there will be a few frames where items have a default texture on them. The default setting for item texture streaming is off, which should leave the game performing as it did prior to this change where all global assets are loaded at startup time like they always have been. While the texture streaming subsystem can be eventually used throughout the game to further reduce memory requirements, it's currently only set up to enable streaming on player equipment.&amp;nbsp; We're really hoping players test this out because moving forward this will be an important part of managing the large number of global assets we have in EverQuest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you die and are going to re-spawn in the same zone, you will no longer zone. All aggro and other side effects of death will remain the same, we are just eliminating the client needlessly reloading datafiles it doesn't need to and the redundant zoning process. Please do look for any misbehavior with this code if you can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Players can now be resurrected while in the limbo dead state. (ie dead hovering over corpse)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chat channels: The "[" key does not auto go to the text box - FIXED&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UI: Players are unable to set up any chat channels to be the default channel in a chat window - FIXED&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Internals of the spell casting system have been cleaned up a bit, please /bug any unusual new spell behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Network code has had some optimizations made, you may notice less network lag. About 50% less data is sent by the zone to the client, on average, than before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Movement of flying or swimming NPCs has been improved to properly deal with vertical movement. This corrects a long standing problem with NPCs warping vertically when swimming or flying. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stability fixes for the zone &amp;amp; client problems that occurred earlier this week have been made.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last but not least, thanks for your patience with dealing with the test server stability over the past couple days. While we try to keep test as stable as possible sometimes it just doesn't work out that way. We've identified and corrected the problems that started on Monday's update and the situation should be much better now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheers&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <title>Channel Server on Test</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=testupdate&amp;message.id=449#M449</link>
      <description>Sorry for the delay in posting this, but we wanted to let players know&#xD;
that Test server is now exclusively using the Universal Chat system&#xD;
instead of the Channel Server.&amp;nbsp; The live servers will be making&#xD;
this same move once they are patched, and we waited as long as we could&#xD;
before converting Test while still allowing us some lead time to track&#xD;
down any bugs with the conversion.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
All player and system owned channels were moved over to the Universal&#xD;
Chat system, so if you owned a channel you should still own it.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
Also the usage of the channels has remained the same so you shouldn't&#xD;
notice any difference on your end.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Currently there is a known issue with auto-joining channels in the new&#xD;
system.&amp;nbsp; We are looking into this and hope to have it resolved&#xD;
soon.&amp;nbsp; Please bug report any problems you encounter with using&#xD;
channels in the new system&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Newbie Death Changes</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=testupdate&amp;message.id=448#M448</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;To help smooth the transition to incurring death penalties for new players (losing experience and leaving a corpse), the level when you start to incur death penalties has been lowered from level 11 to level 6 and the amount of experience you lose when you die now starts at a very small amount at level 6 and slowly ramps up from there. These changes will be going to the test and progression servers later today.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Test Server Update - 5/19/06</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=testupdate&amp;message.id=447#M447</link>
      <description>&lt;!-- Converted from text/plain format --&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;Aside from the usual stability fixes,&amp;nbsp;winding the &#xD;
clockwork network up and feeding the powerwheel gerbils, over the past couple weeks since the &#xD;
last live update we've made a number of changes to Test server lately which we &#xD;
hope players will get a chance to test out for themselves sometime. Here's a list of **CODE** changes that have gone to test server. NOTE: THESE ARE ONLY CODE CHANGES, the design staff has their own set of things they have been working on and are not listed here. ALSO NOTE: Some of these items are only relevant to issues that appeared on Test server during the ongoing development of the code so some of these may not be related to a bug on live servers.&amp;nbsp; That said, most of the list is related to fixes to known live bugs and various new features that percolated to the top of the queue (many of these are due to feedback from Fan Faire). Thanks again for playing on Test!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;Implemented new feature to add buffs to block by &#xD;
name. Please test using different types of spell names (errors, damage buffs, &#xD;
etc) and verify it responds with the appropriate action (either by blocking the &#xD;
buff or specifying error message in chat window).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;Added ability to filter away messages &#xD;
pertaining bard songs which affect pets. To test, create a bard and a character &#xD;
with a pet, cast various spells from the bard on the pet, and try using Options &#xD;
| Filters | Bard Songs On Pets-&amp;gt;Hide to filter them away. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;Widened barter/bazaar window and price &#xD;
column (default values), re: feature request.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;You may no longer attempt to combine if &#xD;
any of the ingredients are for sale in the Bazaar&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Gunthak: Incorrect Functionality: Attempting &#xD;
to drag a corpse on the boat at the Gunthak harbor results in a 'too far away to &#xD;
summon' message (C)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt; Fixed&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;Changing heading of a quadriped will now cause &#xD;
surface orientation to be updated to match the tilt of the ground. To test, &#xD;
change form into anything with 4 legs, stand on a hill, and spin. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;Missile code has been changed quite a bit. Ranged &#xD;
weapons now test LOS when fired, but ignore collision after that and should &#xD;
almost always hit their target (there are cases where range + time of flight + &#xD;
very fast NPC running from it can avoid getting hit). The changes that were made &#xD;
were to make non-spells disregard collision and to have bolt spells use a &#xD;
smaller collision sphere for the flight path collision checks as well as having &#xD;
the flight collision disregard any players/NPCs in the flight path. For ranged &#xD;
weapons, please note that now you only need LOS when you fire and ammo should no &#xD;
longer poof like it used to when an NPC was pinned or another player/NPC is &#xD;
blocking the target. For bolt spells, note that there is not (and wasn't &#xD;
previously) a LOS check when launched and the collision system hitting terrain &#xD;
is still responsible for causing missed spell bolts (in other words, bolts will &#xD;
still poof if shot into a wall). All types of missiles now use a much larger &#xD;
collision sphere on the target for the impact test (I don't think you can test &#xD;
this specifically, just something to be aware of, it's part of the reason why &#xD;
bolts should poof less). &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Removed the line art between Skyfire and &#xD;
Frontier Mountains.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;Added code that allows you to view others members in &#xD;
your group by pressing the "group" button in your map view window. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;When this button is down, you should be able to view your &#xD;
other group members in the current zone with blue x’s. When you mouse &#xD;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;over these group members, you should see their &#xD;
names.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Code: UI Elements prevent you from using right &#xD;
click to mouselook when they are non-visible &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;– Fixed. &#xD;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;Rogue: Ability: Shroud of Stealth: When a rogue is &#xD;
using Hide and Sneak with Shroud of Stealth, then uses the /autofire command, &#xD;
the he does not become visible - fixed. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;Spells: Run speed buffs with low &#xD;
modifiers will slow down characters with run speed AAs ©. Fixed. The code will &#xD;
now use the better run speed mod, so long as the player isn't rooted or snared. &#xD;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Dranik: Players can become stuck &#xD;
behind the grate leading into Dranik Sewers (C)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt; Fixed. &#xD;
Adventure/expedition return locations now track the return location more &#xD;
accurately.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;There is a new command, "/uptime", which &#xD;
shows the client how long the zone has been running. This can be used by both &#xD;
players &amp;amp; GMs and is intended to help people communicate issues related to &#xD;
server stability. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;Made substantial improvements to the &#xD;
lootability of corpses. Corpses now have a much improved targetability. A good &#xD;
example of before &amp;amp; after is a dragorn NPC (anguish zone in). This NPC has &#xD;
it's death animation moving the NPC almost completely out of it's original &#xD;
bounding sphere which required players to loot by clicking on part of the foot &#xD;
which was about all that was left in the original bounding &#xD;
sphere.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Spells: Magician: Fire pets, &#xD;
starting from Vocarate: Fire (52) to Child of Fire (68) are not regenerating &#xD;
mana - fixed&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Bard: Songs Window: The third and &#xD;
sixth icons in this window are oversized and will slightly stack over the buffs &#xD;
next to them - fixed&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Augment: Bloodstone of Force &#xD;
(68806): when combined with weapon with magic dmg boost, result is odd stacking &#xD;
issue - fixed&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Aura of the Grove (55 DRU aura) &#xD;
and Aura of Life (70 DRU aura) if one is cast while the other is active it gives &#xD;
conflicting messages - fixed&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Bards: Bard songs dont stop &#xD;
pulsing when an NPC forces you to feign death- fixed&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;Throwing axes now feed from ammo/inventory. NOTE- a &#xD;
special case can exist where a throwing axe (say, 8008) is both ammo AND range, &#xD;
if one is in the range slot, but the use has seen fit to put arrows in the ammo &#xD;
slot, obviously arrows are not auto-fed. The arrows are ignored, but the &#xD;
inventory IS checked, and axes will auto-feed from there. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Theater: Radial Flora &#xD;
graphical option hides player and NPC names at main fountain – Fixed&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Code: UI Elements prevent you from using right &#xD;
click to mouselook when they are non-visible – Fixed&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt; &#xD;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Cosmetic: Plate graphics on luclin model &#xD;
player characters are disappearing or not showing correctly - &#xD;
Fixed&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Video: Arm and lower leg armor &#xD;
textures vanish in most areas in Delvea - Fixed&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;Feature request for cooldown time to not be incurred &#xD;
if action fails. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;To test, try taunting enemies &#xD;
from too far away and observe the action button to make sure &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;you can try recasting immediately.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;New F&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;eature: Pet spells and weapon procs should report into the Pet Spells &#xD;
chat filter channel. To test, create a chat window and filter in only the pet &#xD;
info. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;Fixed NPC Rampage, AE_Rampage, Flurry to &#xD;
use new (correct) algorithm. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;Put in change which should fix the &#xD;
problem where aggro-scaling buffs take away from aggro-subtracting effects. &#xD;
Specifically, when Concussion-type spells are being affected by Spell Casting &#xD;
Subtlety.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Fear Pathing: Feared PCs can open locked &#xD;
doors&amp;nbsp;- Fixed. This bug also was allowing NPCs to open locked doors, they now &#xD;
just warp through them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Mounts:Summoning your mount near &#xD;
an NPC could in rare case generate agro -&amp;nbsp;Fixed.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt; &#xD;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Rogues: Some NPCs do not detect &#xD;
hidden rogues, but still display detect message&amp;nbsp;- Fixed.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt; &#xD;
Modified /con code to only tell rogues the NPC can see the rogue after running &#xD;
all visibility logic.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Eastwastes: Sleepers switch can &#xD;
not be clicked on by medeum and small races. Fixed.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;Fixed a bug with &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Willowisp animations.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;Flurry/rampage&amp;nbsp;messages were reversed&amp;nbsp;- &#xD;
Target was changing through the attack loop regardless of whether it was rampage &#xD;
or flurry. (It should only change for rampage). To test, find a mob that both &#xD;
flurries and rampages, summon a pet and attack. Watch to make sure that, for &#xD;
example, flurries only cause damage to the target of the flurry as reported in &#xD;
the chat window.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;Fixed the following bugs with ranged weapons. &#xD;
Non-spell missiles (ie arrows/shurikens/etc) now have a life span of 6 seconds &#xD;
which after discussing with Travis we think should be sufficient in all &#xD;
reasonable cases for the arrow to reach it's target. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Rangecombat: When a range item &#xD;
such as an arrow or shruiken is thrown or shot it bonces off walls - &#xD;
fixed.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;Missile changes: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;Due &#xD;
to a timing issue in the old physics code, missiles could be in perma-orbit &#xD;
around a target on the client and/or the server (the timing problem was on both &#xD;
sides, and will rarely be consistent between zone/client). This would cause &#xD;
heavy combat situations to have theoretically as many arrows spinning around the &#xD;
target as could be fired over the course two minutes (the previous lifespan of &#xD;
arrows). Since each missile is using the collision system during movement, it &#xD;
could add up to be pretty expensive especially on raids (say 6 rangers, 1 arrow &#xD;
each per tick is a maximum of approximately 720 arrows existing at a similar &#xD;
cost to what a player or NPC consumes for movement collision costs). &#xD;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Devastation: ground spawn item too low to &#xD;
ground to pick up. Fixed. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Corrected a bug with &#xD;
heightfield collision code which was causing this problem and other subtle &#xD;
inconsistencies in collision behavior with heightfields. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;LDoN: Deep Guk: Many mobs in zone &#xD;
are untargettable from a distance - &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Fixed.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Animation: Sitting while &#xD;
levitation wears off will leave the character stuck in the falling animation. &#xD;
Fixed- &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Players who are sitting when they begin to fall &#xD;
no longer show the falling animation. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Zoning:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Characters are getting stuck in unavailabe zones when instances &#xD;
disconnect &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;- FIXED.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;ragea: sullon zek: raids are &#xD;
crashing during the sullon zek event &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;- FIXED &#xD;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;ai: Under certain circumstances an &#xD;
aura acts as an NPC and can be attacked by NPC's &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;- &#xD;
FIXED.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Monster Missions: Players are &#xD;
being sent to the last LDoN entrance they visited if they attempt to log into a &#xD;
monster mission zone after the task timer expires &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;- &#xD;
FIXED&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;*** DirectX Upgrade ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Continuing our efforts to keep pace with current technology, EverQuest will be upgrading to DirectX9.0c to allow us to take advantage of many of the new features and fixes since our last upgrade in the middle of 2003.&amp;nbsp; This patch upgrades our Test server to DirectX 9.0c, everyone on Test Server will need to upgrade to the latest DirectX run times.&amp;nbsp; This can be done by simply going to &lt;A href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=56513&amp;amp;clcid=0x409" target=_blank&gt;http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=56513&amp;amp;clcid=0x409&lt;/A&gt; and following the instructions there.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Please post any problems you encounter on the Tech Support forum.&amp;nbsp; If possible, please include what graphics card you have installed and what driver version you are running with in the post.&amp;nbsp; We will be monitoring this forum very closely to catch and fix any related issues as quickly as possible.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** EQPlayers Upgrade ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;EQPlayers is being upgraded to track additional data, in order to test this functionality the Test server will not be connected to the live EQPlayers service.&amp;nbsp; We expect this to last approximately 1 month.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;During this period your existing data will still be available for you to view on EQPlayers, but changes to your character will not be reflected in EQPlayers until this testing period ends.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We try to ensure that Test server is connected to EQPlayers as much as possible, but occasional testing requires us to temporarily disable the service.&amp;nbsp; We apologize for any inconvenience.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Test Updates February 8, 2006</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=testupdate&amp;message.id=444#M444</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;*** NOTE *** &lt;/STRONG&gt;These items are NOT currently on the Test server but are being tested on the Beta server.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We expect the following items, along with the items listed under the December 20th message, will be going to Live Servers in Upcoming Live Updates, but can not guarantee they will be in the next Live Update.&amp;nbsp; The next Live Update is scheduled for February 21, 2006.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Events ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;– Raids in Dynamic zones in Gates of Discord now require a minimum of 12 people to be started.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Sendaii the Hive Queen raid will now lock out the expedition after the glowing egg is broken.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- NPC’s should no longer re-spawn after being killed in the Controlling the Beast mission set in Stoneroot Falls.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The mission “Taking Control” from Stoneroot Falls now only requires 3 people to start it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Adjusted the rewards on monster missions so they scale better based on how long it’s actually taking to complete the mission.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Tradeskills ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;– Deep Orc Essence now requires less meat.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;– Disabled the spell research creation of the spell Draught of Lightning.&amp;nbsp; This was done because it is a quest derived spell.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;– Some very old erudite only combines have had their trivials adjusted up from being no-fail to on par with other combines of that era.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Items ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;– Changed the Slot12 Tradeskill augments that have Cleave, Ferocity, Furious Bash, Improved Dodge, Improved Parry and Sharpshooting to be worn effects instead of focus effects.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** New Hot Zones ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The time has come to once again update the "Hot Zones" throughout Norrath. The previous zones have been reverted to their former states and the following zones are now a great place to go for experience and fun:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Level 20: Najena &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Level 25: Iceclad Ocean &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Level 30: Rathe Mountains &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Level 35: Frontier Mountains &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Level 40: Gulf of Gunthak &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Level 45: Velketor's Labrynth &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Level 50: Fungus Grove &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Level 55: Old Sebilis &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Level 60: Cazic Thule &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=testupdate&amp;message.id=443#M443</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;These items are currently on the Test Server.&amp;nbsp; We expect these will be going to Live Servers in Upcoming Live Updates, but can not guarantee they will be in the next Live Update.&amp;nbsp; Please feel free to log onto Test and check them out! &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;*** Events ***&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- The planar projection for defeating Mithaniel Marr was not rewarding the correct character flags.&amp;nbsp; This has been fixed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;*** Tradeskills ***&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;– Planar Fletching Kits are now tradeable.&lt;BR&gt;- Changed Othmir Short Beer to use a bottle instead of a Cask.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;*** Spells ***&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Increased the duration and lowered the mana cost of Talisman of the Tribunal.&lt;BR&gt;- The Test of Efficiency spell should no longer conflict with Peace of the Disciple or Grace of the Order.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;*** AAs ***&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Gift of Mana will no longer be used up when casting a 0 mana spell after it has triggered on you.&lt;BR&gt;- Gift of Mana should now have a chance to trigger on heals other than just instant heals, including heal over time and percent healing spells.&lt;BR&gt;- The way that the wizard AA Mana Burn works has been modified.&amp;nbsp; The new version will use a maximum of 3000 mana instead of draining your whole pool and will do 4 damage for every point of mana spent.&amp;nbsp; This is a raw channeling of magical energy that cannot be focused, and will not crit.&amp;nbsp; The ability is unresistable by normal creatures, but certain extremely powerful creatures may be immune to the effects.&amp;nbsp; Like the original version, once a Mana Burn ability has affected a target, no other mana burn abilities will be able to affect that target for the next minute.&amp;nbsp; Upgraded versions of the ability, Mana Blast and Mana Blaze, are available at level 65 and level 70 and use a maximum of 6000 and 9000 mana respectively.&amp;nbsp; The original Mana Burn ability has been refunded and can be repurchased by Wizards interested in the new version.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=testupdate&amp;message.id=2#M2</link>
      <description>CODE UPDATE INFORMATION&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This post is to try to inform players on Test what has been going on code wise in order for them to try out the fixes &amp; new features if they are so inclined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NOTE: THIS IS ONLY CODE CHANGES. Content (ie spells, items, quests, balance, etc) &amp; other design driven changes are not listed here. Note that not all changes are listed here either, just what I have had the time to gather information on. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Any posts made to this thread that does not stay on topic or is otherwise unrelated to code specific issues will be edited or deleted. ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of these bug fixes are for things that were only broken on Test so don't assume something is broken on Live servers if you see it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------------&lt;br&gt;New Features:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The big new feature with this update is the ability to invite players to join a raid even if they are in another zone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another new feature is a new button in the Options/Display page name "Show My Helm", which should default to "clicked" (meaning Yes, show my helm).  Clicking this button should toggle whether your helm is shown on your and everyone else's clients.  Clicking it back on should look like you just put your helm back on. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A "filter" combo has been added to the GuildBank… players can use this to show a limited set of Guild Bank items.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some significant UI code optimizations related to chat windows have been made, players may notice increased framerate especially if they have a lot of chat windows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The options window now shows Set Windowed and Set Fullscreen appropriately. When in windowed mode, the available resolutions are now limited to desktop size.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;---------------&lt;br&gt;Fixes include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fixed: A crash bug related to casting spells with old particle system effects attached. This is a pretty old bug that has been very hard to reproduce; Rowwyl nailed it though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fixed: UI: Tribute Master and Benefits Windows: Guild Tribute/Monster Missions: After an opted-in member enters a monster mission, Current Cost displays incorrectly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fixed: Monster Missions: If a character is drunk prior entering the mission, the tunnel vision and effects stay with the character in the mission &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fixed: Characters were returning from death at 50% stats rather than 100% &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fixed: Helms: On low poly models (including Vah Shir), helms would never show.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fixed: On Luclin models, helms would show correctly on zone in, but changes to helm status would not update to others in the zone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fixed: Collapsed Items: Was displaying the wrong string file at times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fixed: Global: Merchants are referring to players incorrectly when wearing an illusion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for playing on Test!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheers-</description>

      <title>Test Server Update 10/6/05 (and other recent changes)</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=testupdate&amp;message.id=64#M64</link>
      <description>Just a few quick notes about what went in recently, this isn't a comprehensive list of everything that's been done lately by any stretch but I wanted to share what I had the time to gather up so that people on Test can know what to check out. Note that some of these bugs are specific to Test only.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The new audio triggers window is now available to Test. It can be accessed via the EQ menu or you can create a hotkey for it in the Options window. There is a help button on the audio trigger window that explains all the details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Some more fixes to the new mouse code have been made. We're still working through what we hope are the last of the related issues, please keep /bugging them as you see them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Mounts should again be disappearing when you try to make them swim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Clickable items should be working in no combat zones again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Guild invites for shrouded players have had the text corrected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Removed the taunt hotkey from new berzerkers (they never had the ability, shouldn't have had the hotkey)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Large mobs (especially giants) will no longer warp on top of players when fighting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The compass window has been modified slightly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- After mouse look is used, the mouse is moved to where it was at the beginning of the mouse look action.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a bug where mouse was considered active and windows could be moved even though EverQuest was in the background.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- DoD zones have been added to the Atlas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Changed the XML for the chat window to allow p, g, and q to be correctly rendered (they were being cut off).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Personal Tribute should now deactivate while not playing the main character (ie shrouded or monster mission)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Taking a lower level shroud while tribute is activated no longer wipes tribute choices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- If you augment an evolving items, you can again view "final result" of the item.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Options Window: Players were only seeing the first 25 text color options listed…  Fixed&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed- If the user died with an item on their cursor, the user would not be able to remove gold from their bank. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed- Boar Mount: Boar is being summoned even if player is not able to do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Players in template form (spirit shroud/monster mission) will no longer auto-join a class chat channel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a crash problem with Find.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed- Spirit Shroud: When in low level shroud form any leadership abilities above four were lost when leaving shroud form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed- Bandaging other players was not giving any healing effect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed- NPC:Seru's animations were broken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed- Pets: HP items were no longer adding to the maximum health of pets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed- Atlas: Grobb is labeled as Gukta on Atlas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed- Code: If a character dies while LD, Charmed or Feared the corpse can not be dragged by anyone except the owner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Three new commands have been added:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;/www &lt;i&gt;website&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  - Causes your system's web browser to open up the specified website. Note that in fullscreen mode this will make you leave fullscreen when the browser pops up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;/url &lt;i&gt;URL&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - Activates the specified URL, which may be something other than a http:// URL, such as an ftp:// URL.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;/system &lt;i&gt;command [arguments]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - Execute the specified system command. This is functionally identical to opening a command prompt and typing the command directly. NOTE THAT THIS IS A POWER USER COMMAND, and because we don't want an inexperienced computer user to be fooled into doing something they shouldn't do, the user must manually edit their eqclient.ini to enable this command. The help for this command (just type /system by itself) explains what exactly needs to be done to enable this command. The anticipated use for this is for people to make hotkeys to control various popular voice chat software, but due to the general nature of this command it can be used for a lot of things. Using this command, people who use those types of applications can control them via hotkeys configured to run system commands as required by those applications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for playing on Test!&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Grumbuk-Dev on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;10-06-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;10:26 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>Some more code changes to share. Note that this post is only for code changes, a lot of stuff has changed with respect to content that the designers have been working on but this post is only for code changes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Implemented what we hope is the solution for the "Exodus Bug". This is what people are referring to as "hitting exodus and dying while zoning". Basically, the zone would land the exodus spell on the player but due to network latency the client would sometime later actually begin the zoning process. During that latency window, the zone would continue to process the player which could result in the player being killed by an NPC or DoT while in this transitional state. We've made substantial changes to the zoning process in order to correct this problem. Please let us know of any related problems ASAP, this bug is a high priority for us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* The raid window is now available to all EverQuest players. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* The LFGroup windows are now available to all EverQuest players.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* A bug related to large NPCs in certain zones warping when in flee mode has been fixed. Please be on the lookout for new pathing related issues. Bazu NPCs in wall of slaughter, for instance, now flee correctly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* The mapping window is now enabled in all zones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* The potion belt window now stores it's visible/invisible status between zoning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* The advanced display options indow has been enhanced substantially.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Group management has been substantially reworked. You can now invite players to your group from other zones and from any distance in the same zone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;Cheers-&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Grumbuk-Dev on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-16-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;01:46 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>Hi folks,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are some code changes that have made it to Test recently that I think people might be interested in. They haven't all passed QA yet but if people want to go test things out before the next live update this is probably a good time to try them out:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-----------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Auto Consent Group, Raid and Guild are now toggle buttons available in the Options window. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* The way EverQuest deals with INI files has been improved. Players on slower computers will notice this this most. Momentary framerate hitches that you may have noticed when opening bags or doing other things that caused INI files to be written out should be much improved. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Loading optimizations have been made. We've seen some systems load the game as much as 12 seconds faster, but this will vary per system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Players no longer have to find a guild master to begin using new skills made available by reaching a new level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Spell hate for spells with a fixed amount of hate now include hate-focus effects. Previously, spells with fixed amount of hate assigned to them would disregard hate focus effects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Leadership and raid assist ranges now have the same distance rules as the /assist command.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Accounts that do not have PoP or later expansions, but are eligible for veteran rewards, are now able to access them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* A rendering problem with luclin models on older GeForce cards (1/2/4MX) has been corrected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Persistent general channels have been added that currently have General, Class and Current Region set up. There is an button in the options window to control whether or not you wish to auto join these channels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Fixed an old issue with AA timers not being initialized properly. Previously, any new activatable AA ability that has a reuse timer would have an uninitialized value which would sometimes prevent players from using it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheers!</description>

      <description>I know this is a day late but I wanted to make sure this info was available since we are updating live servers pretty soon and we need folks on Test to know about what's been changed lately. I grabbed relevant notes since the last post on 4/14.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: Some of these bugfixes below are for bugs that only ever appeared on Test server. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------------------&lt;br&gt;* On *TEST* and -only- on Test server, combat experience has been doubled. This will not be going to any other server, and is intended to help players on Test deal with the daily server downtime that occurs every day, sometimes 3 or 4 times a day, as we develop new content for EverQuest. This is one of what we hope is the first of several things to help players on Test overcome the stability issues that will always be present there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Players under level 10 no longer lose their memmed spells when they die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Names above players/NPCs should now be visible at twice the distance they were before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* UI: Filters: NPC spell interrupted messages are again showing when you interrupt an NPCs spell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* The atlas has had these zones added: Barter, Umbral Plains, Vex Thal. Zone connections between Marus Seru &amp; Mons Letalis &amp; Sanctus Seru have been added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* If you are feared/charmed or dead when a DoN style mission is completed you will still get the mission reward now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Runes were wearing off according to the amount of the rune and not according to order of cast – fixed&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Intoxicating Rage was not working as intended – fixed&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Severilous's Ceticious Cloud was not affecting PC sobriety - fixed&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Curse of Kel`Novar was not affecting PC sobriety (C) – fixed&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* AA Ability Eldritch Rune: Does not give cannot cast while ducking message (D) – fixed&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* When casting Fang of Death or Wake the Dead on Eye of Zomm the client would crash or go to server select - fixed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* PVP: If a player kills your charmed pet, you could not charm another pet until that corpse is cleared - fixed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Big changes to both merchant &amp; mail windows, too much to list here and if you're on Test you already know what they are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Individual Crystals can be lost due to stacking issue. Fixed; Changed it so you can not pick up crystals if you have anything in your held slot or limbo buffer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheers,</description>

      <description>Test was primarily patched to fix the issues with Tradeskills, they should now work as expected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also included in this patch are:&lt;br&gt;  - Updates to the Atlas window.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  - Updates to the mail system including:&lt;br&gt;      Mail Window:&lt;br&gt;        - New options and address book buttons&lt;br&gt;        - A "Reply To All" button&lt;br&gt;        - A "To" field that is visible in the view pane when reading your e-mail&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      Mail Composition Window:&lt;br&gt;        - A from field that displays who you are as you send the e-mail (since you can now quickly switch between the mailboxes of all your characters on that server).&lt;br&gt;        - You can now send to multiple recipients by seperating their names with commas (or using an address book name)&lt;br&gt;        - A "synch" button to synchronize your TO field and address book.  This helps adds entries to your address book, or update old ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      Address Book Window:&lt;br&gt;        - You can add names, addresses, and notes&lt;br&gt;        - A checkbox "Private" that means during address expansion, the addresses will appear individually - not as the address book name for the group of addresses.&lt;br&gt;        - Automatic update of the "guild" address (this sends a messages to all guild members).  If anybody joins/leaves the guild, this is updated in the address book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      Options:&lt;br&gt;        - An address book filename, configurable per character.&lt;br&gt;        - Selecting an existing address will load that address book.&lt;br&gt;        - Selecting a new address book filename will save the current address book to that file.&lt;br&gt;        - Mail forwarding.  If this is turned on, it will forward your characters e-mail to the e-mail address you have registered with your Station Account.&lt;br&gt;        - Audio and text notifications of new e-mail.</description>

      <description>Hello, here are some things that went to Test server today, please let us know of any problems. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note that some of these fixes are for bugs that *only* existed on Test server during development of new features.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;UI: Guild Tribute window benefits appear in alternate characters window untill the next cycle - Fixed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Guildhall: Buff Timers: Share Wolf Form does not stall in Guild Hall - Fixed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;UI: Options Window: Filters tab: The text in the drop down box is black, making it very difficult to read - fixed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;UI: Options Window: Filters Tab: Chat Filters are not working - Fixed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;UI: Chat Filters: Modifications to chat filters are not being saved when logging out - Fixed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;UI: Badword filter now in Options/Filters page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Character Loading Zone (CLZ, aka Character Select): If you use Explore mode to go to the Arch to enter the game in an instance zone (logged out in Tutorial or Guild Hall), you'll leave explore mode, but continue travelling and multiple copies of your other characters will exist when you re-enter explore mode. Fixed. Now, when you get an error from trying to log in (like "instance loading"), it takes you completely out of explore mode to clean up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- New user changes: These changes occur when logging in for the first time:&lt;br&gt;	- Default clip plane now farther out (~75% from 0%)&lt;br&gt;	- Default gamma a little higher (11 instead of 8)&lt;br&gt;	- Map window default value for Height Filter button should not be filtered.  Zoom should be zoomed out enough to see a fair portion of the zone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- NO RENT should now read TEMPORARY in item view. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- NO DROP should now read NO TRADE in item view. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Added Label EQType 134 - Currently Casting spell. Added it to Casting window, but it can be used anywhere in a custom UI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Players with Omens or Gates, but not Ykesha, were not being properly updated with Guild Tribute Benefits. - Fixed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- AA: Bard AA shield of notes does not reset if it fails to land due to all buff slots being filled – fixed&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- AA: Dance of Blades does not reset if the ability does not take hold – fixed&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Spells: Problems with landing spells with a recourse [post lifeburn fix] – fixed&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Bandolier: 'Auto Swap' is not saving its current state. – fixed&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Client crash: When spam clicking item Vibrating gauntlets of infuse - Fixed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Find Buyer will not unhide a buyer that has been hidden in the bazaar - Fixed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Spell: Bond of the Wild does not land on pet if it is unable to land on player – fixed&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Crocodiles and Wetfang Minnows will no longer use underwater bubbles or cold breath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheers,</description>

      <description>&lt;FONT color=#ffffff size=2&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Described below are most of the changes that have been introduced over the past few weeks on our test server. The information includes a host of new features, changes, and bug fixes.&amp;nbsp; We have not updated you in a few weeks so here it is.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The patcher and login news screens have been updated with this information as well.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Headliners ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- A new button has been added to character select: Return Home. If a character has not been played in the past 6 hours, this button is enabled and pressing it will log the character into the game in their starting city.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- If a character is logged out for more than an hour, full health, mana, and endurance will be granted upon logging in. This is still a bit under development. You may not be quite at 100% but very close.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Re-envisioning has begun!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Over 600 Spell modifications.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- New zone art for the character select screen and character creation. Crossing the bridge while in Explore mode will allow you to enter the world. Note that all characters are in the same area now. There are no longer class specific areas.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- New Hot Spots!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Estate of Unrest&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Solusek's Eye&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Kurn's Tower&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Warrens&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Netherbian Lair&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Echo Caverns&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Scarlet Desert&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Tower of Frozen Shadow&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Hole&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Grey&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Howling Stones&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The Halls of Betrayal (Chardok B)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- We believe we have corrected the problem with the excessive server lag that has been happening in most raid zones. A guild from one of our live servers was willing to come over to our test server and verify the raid in pofire was working properly without causing the zone to lag out. They were able to complete many of the stages of the raid successfully and even multiple times without issue. There was one instance of a mob warping after getting in a bad location, but we have made vast improvements from its current state. We have also improved our logging code to better detect similar problems should they occur again in the future. Please let us know if you experience any problems related to this.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- There are 2 new keyboard shortcuts in the Command section in the Options menu, Open Inventory Bags and Close Inventory Bags. Setting these, then using them will open/close all your general inventory slot bags (bag1-bag8).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added a teleportation stone to Arena in Plane of Knowledge.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Re-envisioning Specifics ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Many modifications have been made to the cast times, recast times, mana costs, and damage potential of many single target direct damage spells. The largest changes have been in level 1-50 spells, but many 50+ spells have been adjusted as well. These changes have caused the damage-per-second potential and/or the damage-per-mana values of these spells to be increased and should benefit the classes who use these spells in nearly all cases. Note that this also includes special purpose spells such as undead and summoned direct damage spells. Please check the in game descriptions for specific changes.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The 750 cap on mana increase spells has been removed.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The hard-coded level 52 NPC cap on Fear spells has been removed. We will be adding new fear spells in the near future which will allow players to fear higher level NPCs.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Assassin’s Feint will now work on NPCs level 60 and higher.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Spells with poison counters no longer have innate agro added. The spells themselves still generate aggro based on their other properities, but you will see a reduction in the amount of aggro generated in many cases.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- NPC’s innate 20% resistance against rain spells has been removed.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- You will now receive messages in your chat window when you are healed by any heal-over-time spell. This includes both short term HOT spells as well as long term regen spells. You will receive the message if the spell actually gave you health back, so will not receive messages when at full health. These messages can be turned off through a new filter in the options window.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Ranger, Beastlord, and Paladin heals have been upgraded. See the spell descriptions in game for details.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The AC cap and percentage return on AC over the cap for monks has been increased.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Increased the knock back effect on the Warrior AA Press the Attack.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Theft of Thought will no longer return only partial mana from NPCs over level 52. In addition, the spell was changed so that it will only return as much mana as the NPC has if that is less than the amount that the spell is trying to steal. So it will steal 400 mana from an NPC that has 1000 mana, but it will only steal 100 mana from a NPC that has 100 mana.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Spells, Skills &amp;amp; AAs ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Increased the effectiveness and decreased the casting time of the Ranger AA Auspice of the Hunter.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Increased the amount of damage absorbed by the Bard AA Shield of Notes.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Increased the damage done while using the Bard AA Dance of Blades.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added a negative resistance mod to the Shaman AA Virulent Paralysis so it is more likely to land on NPCs now.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Modified the proc chance on spell Lightning Channeling and Storm Channeling. Both of these spells now have an increased proc chance.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Sound of Divinity and Sound of Might will now use their own separate shared spell timer.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The spell enhanced learning can no longer have its duration increased by Alternate advancement skills and/or focus effects.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Flames of the Valiant and Flames of Redemption should now proc more often and be resisted much less often.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Protection of the Wild should no longer be overwritten by Strength of the Hunter.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added a 30 second recast time to spirit of the panther and spirit of the leopard. Additionally, the rate at which pets trigger the effect of these spells has been lowered to match the rate at which players trigger effects.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Removed the focus effect limiters from Persuasive Gaze, the focus effect found on the enchanter epic 1.5. It now works on any detrimental spells up to level 70 the same way the focus effect on the enchanter epic 2.0 does.* &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Fixed a problem with focus effects that reduce hate. It was not using the highest effect if more than one focus effect was worn.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Items ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Items that have a combat or clickable spell effect that was changed due to the spell changes in this patch have either had their proc rate adjusted to compensate or use a new spell to maintain their damage potential.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The Anguish chest pieces now have additional worn mods and a new spell focus effect.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The Anguish wrist pieces now have additional worn mods.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Mirrored Mask will no longer conflict with other recast timer based items such as the Soul Orb.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Hammer of Rancorous Thoughts is now a 39/25 weapon with a 225pt proc.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Dragonkiller is now a 34 (+2 magic)/21 weapon.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Mace of Grim Tidings is a 32/22 weapon.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Broken Mandible of the Broodqueen is now a 12/18 weapon and has a +5% mod to backstab.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Fang of Kessdona now has +12% mod to backstab.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Crescent Palemoon now has the focus Aneuk Glare. It also has +15 avoid, +4 spell rune and +4 regen.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Aegis of the Amber Moon now has +3 shielding, +4 dot rune, +6 regen.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Bladewhisper Chain Gloves of Journeys now has Cleave V as the worn effect.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Bladewhisper Chain Legguards of Journeys now has the focus of Alacrity of the Ikaav.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Summoned: Burning Shank should proc more often.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Eye of Yar`Lir is now called "Oculus of Yar`Lir".&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Bracelet of the Corrupter now has +2 mana regen.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Wristband of Spectral Corruption now has +2 mana regen and +20 attack.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Bracer of Corrupted Souls now has +2 mana regen and +20 attack.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Bracer of the Debauched now has +2 mana regen and +20 attack.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Missions, Quests &amp;amp; Events ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added the following new Dragons of Norrath missions&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;House of the Autumn Rose (Norrath's Keepers Only)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Plunder the Hoard (Dark Reign Only)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;A Goblin's Escort&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Halfling's Treasure Map&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Signal Fires&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Sudden Tremors&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;These will show up on the usual mission givers once you have enough faction. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Modified the shards awarded for many of the Dragons of Norrath missions to better reflect how long they are taking to complete.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Changed the adventure "The Gilded Scroll" to fix some situations that could cause players to be unable to finish the mission. Now the Noble Kirin Scholar will not spawn before the real scroll is found. We also fixed a problem that could, in very rare cases, cause the real scroll not to be placed on an NPC.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The corrupted drake adds in the Vishimtar encounter will now respawn correctly after a failure.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Made a change to Burning Woods that should reduce the number of NPCs that get stuck under the world . This should make the hornets easier to find.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Changes were made to all Muramite Proving Ground trials. The major changes are: Adaptation is slightly easier, the trial of Ingenuity was significantly changed, and NPC resists in all single group trials were lowered.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- In the Citadel of Anguish it's no longer possible to fight Arch Mage Vangl without completing the Keldovan, Jelvan, and Hanvar events first.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The Warden Hanvar encounter has been made more challenging; you may wish to bring some extra allies with you. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Beware, if you are too close to a wall the swarm adds in the Mata Muram encounter will spawn directly on top of you. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;– Increased the drop rate for the Tongue of the Zun’muram off Zun’Murum Tkarish Zyk in Txevu. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Changed the quest that gives alternative access to Txevu. When you hail the golem at the end of Inktu`ta it will check your items and flags and do the following:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you do not yet have a Qvic flag, the golem will give you the Splinter of the High Temple.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you do have a Qvic flag, the golem will give you whichever High Temple pieces you are missing.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you already have a Txevu flag, the Cipher of Txevu item, or all three fragments of the High Temple, the golem will ignore you.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Likewise, when you complete the Qvic backflag, if you have the Splinter of the High Temple from completing Inktu`ta you will automatically receive whichever High Temple pieces you are missing.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This change allows the combination of Inktu`ta and the Qvic backflag quest to count for Txevu access and the two can be completed in any order. This change is not retroactive.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- A bug was fixed so that Alkron Wyrmsong will no longer give bards a cloth cap when an error is made during the quest for Epic 2.0&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** NPCs ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Modified King Xorbb in Beholder. He will now drop Slime Crystal Staff 100% of the time.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Players can no longer attempt to give stacks of items to NPCs. The NPC would treat the stack as one item and you would lose the rest. There is now a check to help with people putting in a stack of items and losing them.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Items given to an NPC by a PC will no longer count as a Task item when looted.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- NPC pathing code has been reviewed and some changes have been made which should prevent NPCs from becoming stuck and eventually becoming invisible. Please let us know if you see this happen any more. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The Cube Fragments in the Gates of Discord Sewer trials will no longer get stuck in the geometry.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The Soulbinder at the Firiona Vie outpost is now able to bind you to that area.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Tradeskills ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We have changed the chance to gain a skill up when using tradeskills. Previously there was a large increase in the average number of combines needed for a skill increase for skill values of 160 through 190. This made sense when 200 was the skill cap. We have changed the algorithm to remove the harsh spike in combines required for skill ups from 160 to 190, making it a more reasonable to increase all the way up to 300. For more details please see the post here: http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Trade&amp;amp;message.id=5800&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Alabaster Beak and Ivory Stormrider Canine are now marked as usable in tradeskills.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Dragons of Norrath brewing items now drop off NPCs. They were only available through foraging before.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added the race name to the Unfired Cookie Cutters. New item names are: Unfired Barbarian Cookie Cutter, Unfired Gnome Cookie Cutter, Unfired Troll Cookie Cutter and Unfired Animal Cookie Cutter.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added the recipes for four cookie cutters for Luclin beasties. The sketches and molds should be easily found on vendors.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added the appropriate effects to Dragons of Norrath potions.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The recipe for dough made from Rock Hopper Egg now uses Rockhopper Egg. It turns out that there were two items with similar names, but the one used in the recipe doesn't drop in game.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Removed the recipe for chain jointing that was used in Planes of Power armor. This recipe was removed because the jointing is no longer used in any recipes.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- You will now only need to collect half the number of items for the level 65+ Vah Shir racial armor pattern book quest.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Server stability ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The memory leak problems that have recently been affecting the world servers has had much progress. Several memory leaks related to the previous update have been corrected, and server stability has improved measurably as a result. We will continue to monitor the servers closely for memory leak issues.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Crashes related to interactive objects in LDoN adventures have been fixed.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Crashes related to interactive objects in LDoN adventures have been fixed.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- A zone crash in Chardokb related to the Korucust encounter has been fixed.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- A zone crash related to guild tribute being toggled while a player was being charmed or feared has been fixed.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Chat filtering ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Pet responses to commands (except for /pet leader) are no longer broadcast, but go only to the owner of the pet.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Pet responses to commands can now have a selected color and be redirected to any chat window.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Pet spell-casting messages can now have a selected color, be redirected to any chat window, and be filtered to not show at all.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Assassinate, Deadly Strike, Slay Undead, and Finishing Blow messages will now be displayed in the Melee Critical message color and redirect/filter as other crits.*&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Mail System ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- You now have quick access to all of your character mailboxes on the current server from any of your characters.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Title Suffixes ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The title system now supports title suffixes. The first use of this new feature are the server titles.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Guild Hall (Guilds) ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added a guild tribute master to the guild hall.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The guild bank no longer accepts NORENT items.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Fixed a bug that allowed players with out the proper flags to remove items from the Guild bank.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Using any Eye of Zomm type spells in a guild hall will no longer take the client to server select.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Bazaar/Barter ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added and Augment pool and Augment Solvent Merchant in the Bazaar.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Added new search criteria to the Bazaar search: min level, max level. Any items which match all other search criteria, yet have a rec or req level outside the boundaries set in the new fields will not be returned by the search.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The barter UI code has been improved. There were some issues related to keeping the client properly synchronized with the server which have been fixed. It now more accurately tracks changes in inventory when multiple players are interacting with a buyer. Also, if a buyer has a LORE item, any buy-lines that require the LORE item will now automatically disable because the buyer would not be able to complete the transaction (because it would result in two lore items on the buyer). Previously this was causing a client-server sync issue that would result in a player being disconnected.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Barter Search Window: Right-clicking on the item sought by Buyers found in a search will display that item. You now have to right click on the Buyer's name to get the search path.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** UI ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Fixed an issue causing custom UIs to show bad data in unused buff slots. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The Task display now properly displays tasks with a large number of elements.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- On character select, if you want to go back into the tutorial, just click the tutorial button below the list of characters. It is no longer a toggle button.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Miscellaneous ***&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Increased the maximum level range spread for LDoN adventures from 7 to 10 so you can now group with someone 10 levels above or below you.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Critical heals now produce a message similar to other spells that crit.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Fixed corpse looting bugs for corpses that have been summoned or moved out of dynamic zones.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- Closing multiple bags while using the bank no longer causes the client to crash.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;- The raid locking system had various bugs which are now fixed. Please let us know if you encounter any problems with the raid tool.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;* Denotes a community request.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;</description>

      <description>Sorry for the late post, but here are the things that went out in today's Test update:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Player's can now choose a title suffix.  This will appear at the end of the player's name and currently the only available suffix is "of Test".  There is an issue with the spacing causing it to show right next to the player's last name, but this is fixed and will be corrected with the next patch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed the "Return Home" feature for player's that had multiple starting city options.  In some cases it was sending the player to the wrong city.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Ogres, Dark Elves, and Trolls should now appear at character selection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- At character creation, the character should appear properly lit now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Various minor fixes that are too numerous to mention.  :)</description>

      <description>Greetings&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am guessing some folks would like to know that the update going to Test today will correct at least some of the zone server lag problems people have been seeing lately. Players generally see this problem as zone-wide lag, unresponsive NPCs while continuing to be able to chat &amp; move around until eventually the zone is restarted. I don't want to say "all zone server lag" because there are other server lag issues that are unrelated to this specific problem, but this update should make a dramatic improvement for the problems people have been seeing lately with zone stability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Due to the nature of the changes it will require a fair amount of QA time to make sure it's working properly. I don't have a timeframe for when these fixes will go to Live servers yet, but I can say we'll be working on getting it out as soon as it is possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheers,</description>

      <description>Hello,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today's update to Test was mainly related to network code optimizations, event script commands and server side bug fixes. But there are a few things that might interest folks:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Removed the extra z-distance check from all ranged weapons. Range is now limited to the range of the weapon alone with no reduced case made for z-distance. That is to say, a target will no longer be too far above or below any more, they can only be too far away and the distance used is using the normal ranged distance value.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* The bard /melody command has had some fixes. Using /stopsong, /cast, or anything that starts a song other than /melody now clears the /melody buffer and makes it so that melody will not restart unexpectedly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Bounding radius for the Invader Lamia model has been reduced, targeting around these kinds NPCs should be improved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* The spell "Wail of Anguish" is no longer giving the message 'You shake off the stun effect!' when you have just been stunned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Target window no longer loses the con color if closed &amp; reopened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheers,</description>

      <title>Test Server Update 11/8/2004</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=testupdate&amp;message.id=391#M391</link>
      <description>-----------------------------&lt;br&gt;TEST SERVER CODE UPDATE 11/8/04&lt;br&gt;Please remember that all changes on Test are subject to change and may not make it to Live servers depending on the results of testing.&lt;br&gt;Thanks for playing on Test!&lt;br&gt;-------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The /autofire command should work for non-GM clients now and various bugs related to it have been fixed.&lt;br&gt;- Added code to check and validate specialization skills. If the values are not legal, the player informed why they are not legal and they are reset.&lt;br&gt;- Added popup confirmation dialog when you attempt to give an augmented item to an NPC.&lt;br&gt;- Added chat message when submitting a /bug as feedback to let you know if it was submitted or cancelled.&lt;br&gt;- No-rent containers no longer poof on login if they contain items. They instead change into an unenchanted container with the same number of slots, and a chat message notifies the player.&lt;br&gt;- The Tradeskill window will now allow up to 500 total favorites (up from 100) across all tradeskills.&lt;br&gt;- Added optional parameters to /book command -- /book open, /book close&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a bug with haste items and haste augments. Their effects were stacking when they shouldn't have.  It will now only take the greatest haste effect from the item including augments.&lt;br&gt;- Fixed bug where a player that has over 2 million plat in his inventory was unable to purchase anything from a vendor or trader.&lt;br&gt;- /yell messages are no longer displayed if the yelling player is in your ignore list&lt;br&gt;- /Melody should now be working properly.&lt;br&gt;- Some models that were scaled dramatically could cause the collision system to fail, resulting in warps to ceiling and other strange side effects. In particular the vases in dranikcatacombsa at 1000,-1011, 0.&lt;br&gt;- Players standing on the lip of an edge should now slide off them more smoothly. This should dramatically reduce how often players experience 20k fall bug (which is still being looked into) and also make it much easier to get out of the water in many situations.&lt;br&gt;- There have been some optimizations to the collision system. You may see improved performance in zones with very large stationary objects (potimea, bloodfields, etc).&lt;br&gt;- Fixed problem with the Beastlord AA Bestial Alignment where if you had maxed buffs this AA would not reset if it did not take. &lt;br&gt;- Duration enhancement focuses and AAs should now increase the duration of pet buffs.&lt;br&gt;- The spell Nature's Blight was not increasing the damage as stated and should be working as intended now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;----------------------------------&lt;br&gt;TEST SERVER CODE UPDATE 10/25/2004&lt;br&gt;Please remember that all changes on Test are subject to change and may not make it to Live servers depending on the results of testing. &lt;br&gt;Thanks for playing on Test!&lt;br&gt;----------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- Auto attack should now turn off when the player feigns death.  This should be true whether the player uses a skill (monk) or a spell (necro, sk, etc).&lt;br&gt;-- Fixed a number of small bugs in the zoom camera behavior.  These fixes include removing the possibility of having the first mousewheel click causing the camera to bounce back into first person, a bug that could cause the camera to get stuck “one click” out of first person, as well as smoothing out the camera motion a bit.&lt;br&gt;-- Scrolling to third person and tabbing to another window should no longer cause the screen to bounce back and forth.&lt;br&gt;-- /autofire is now available for testing. To use this, make a social key that uses the slash command "/autofire". Please be sure to let us know of any issues with this command. &lt;br&gt;-- Mounts should no longer be dismissed when zoning. &lt;br&gt;-- Summoning mounts in certain places should no longer cause players to fall through geometry.&lt;br&gt;-- Getting out of water should be much easier to do. &lt;br&gt;-- Berzerker: Hastenend War Cry should be fixed now.&lt;br&gt;-- If your stored AA's go above 30, they will no longer be set to 30 when you zone. However, you should still not be able to gain more than 30 unless you get a refund, get the AA from a GM, or get an AA from a script.&lt;br&gt;-- Spell scribe timers (putting a new spell into the spell book) now take only 1 second.&lt;br&gt;-- Players should no longer experience 20k falls when standing on cliff edges while suffering from low framerate. Please be on the lookout for collision problems and /bug with detailed locations if you experience any.&lt;br&gt;-- Fixed an issue with Half Elf Paladins of Tunare and the Origin AA.&lt;br&gt;-- The bounding radius for small races was too tall, preventing them from accessing some areas. For example, gnomes couldn't enter the small huts in steamfont. This was a global problem, that is just an example. Please be on the lookout for any movement or collision issues related to small races.&lt;br&gt;-- You may notice various NPCs that had been standing on tents or otherwise not where they should be are now properly positioned. Please bug any NPCs you see that appear to be incorrectly placed.&lt;br&gt;-- Weather effects should now be working properly when the Wake of Karana spell is used.&lt;br&gt;-- Sounds related to starting &amp; stopping of various weather types due to zoning and Wake of Karana should be working correctly.&lt;br&gt;-- Added NO_PET to item description window which will be displayed when an item has this flag.&lt;br&gt;-- Changed /who commands to display both class title and base class name for players over level 50, e.g. "Bedazzler (Enchanter)"&lt;br&gt;-- Fixed a bug that caused a lot of writing to the dbg.txt file during a raid&lt;br&gt;-- Bazaar trader mode is no longer cancelled when going from windowed to full-screen and vice-versa.&lt;br&gt;-- Fog effects are no longer carrying over into other zones.</description>
