      <title>Damage Calculation code bug with backstab.</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Rogue&amp;message.id=4389#M4389</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is a very obscure bug that would only effect high end rogues, and im not sure if it extends to other classes abilities. As it is right now, if your piercer goes over 32 dmg the dagger will automatically backstab for minimum damage. I started to notice some unusual activity when I looted an &lt;a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=46768" target="_blank"&gt;Etched Obsidian Shard&lt;/a&gt;. I put it in my 2.5 with a verdent emerald of wounding to make, this 32 + 3 / 19&amp;nbsp; dagger. The +3 was elemental of course, but I was consistantly being on the low end of parses and figured it was RNG or me being pre-occupied paying attention to&amp;nbsp; other things while leading raids. When I looted,&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=46927" target="_blank"&gt;Embershank, The malady&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; tonight I equipped it and went to go do a weaponry trial to Ooh and Ahhh! So I noticed my attack around 3100, and noticed not most but, EVERY SINGLE backstab was minimum Damage. At first I was like, well this is a fluke. So me and my friends go to a nest mission so I can do some further parsing. Here is the data i found, I first ran&amp;nbsp; through with Embershank and then Jagged Timeforged Blade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Embershank, The Malady Aug'd with Etched Obsidian Shard to make this dagger 35+1/21.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Backstab:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;total damage 102,255&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Damage Per Second: 81.28&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Average Hit: 355.05&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Minimum hit 322&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jagged Timeforged Blade Unaug'd. 20/19&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Backstab:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Total Damage:&amp;nbsp; 229,586&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Damage Per Second: 251.46&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Average Hit: 922.03&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Minimum Hit: 322&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;From the parse here you can see a plane of time weapon&amp;nbsp; totally dominates&amp;nbsp; a 35+1/21 dagger, the embershank. I'd say its fairly conclusive that there is a bug and im fairly certain the cut off point for this bug is 32dmg as I would only see it on my fully augmented 2.5 dagger when&amp;nbsp; elemental damage hit.&amp;nbsp; This also makes me feel a bit less paranoid, because I thought either A.) Mobs AC went through the roof this expansion, B.) I had the worst luck in the world or C.) I lost my mojo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Dalnoth-Vaz on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;12-04-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;05:58 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>This has been going on for awhile, and Everyone seems content to just work around the issue by sticking a LDON aug in an item that has a Faerune effect on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have to say that I am not happy with the situation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It seems to me that there has been no answer from the Dev's. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dev's Please just respond to this post. I have even typed out the possible answers so you can just hit reply and a number.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. We are working on it.&amp;nbsp; I expect to be putting the fix in the next patch, in the form of an AA/Skill.&lt;br&gt;2. We recognize the problem, but rogues aren't worth the time.&lt;br&gt;3. We had no clue that rogues wouldn't be able to see themselves. Guess we never tested this, as none of the developers would play a rogue when we have a bezerker class.&lt;br&gt;4. Rogues will have to tough it out till we fix the new Invis in the next expansion in 4 months.&amp;nbsp; Use the semi hacked jimmy rigged solution to further gimp an already dying class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;Ronoake&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Rogue&amp;message.id=4366#M4366</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;in my humble, estimation, a rouge is a thief. What better way to increase the rogues usefullness to the game in toto than pickpocketing?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Just a suggestion.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Make an entirely new loot table, accessible only to those who can pickpocket. if the mob dies and no rogue has successfully picked his pocket, that particular loot is gone and doesnt transfer to the main loot table for that mob.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What to put in the new loot table?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;money? nah! too many other ways to make money.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;How about, a specific line of small ticket items. such as jewelry,&amp;nbsp; gems, spells, things a person would normally have in their pockets.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;At the largest in size, a small knife perhaps. Other things would fit better into the game and into the perception of reality here,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;glowing black stones, rare gems, spell pages, a rock, a knucklebone from some poor unfortunate soul the mob ate right before meeting you, a toothpick. The list goes on and on in EQ. you have so many items in the game and hardly many ways to earn them. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This would allow the rogue to always remain on his toes, wondering what the pickpocket ability could possibly grant him. some no drop items, some items he could sell. some he would consider using, or some part of a tradeskill.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;makes ya go hmmmmm? doesnt it?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Rogue&amp;message.id=4359#M4359</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I have just 200ked for the third time since TSS release in an area that I should not have 20ked in.&amp;nbsp; I currently am a 75 rogue with 186 safe fall skill.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I am also a woodelf and have had Origin since days after it was available, and have had Kelethin as my home port city.&amp;nbsp; Every time since I have had Origin, I have jumped from the top of Kelethin and sustained 400-500 damage (not much when you had 7k+ at the time and now over 10k unbuffed), and I have not once 20ked from the top.&amp;nbsp; The other day, I 200ked from the top of Kelethin with a skill in the 170s.&amp;nbsp; Next, when running to Anguish, I jumped from the Guild portal port in area in WOS and 200ked off that cliff (very small jump comparably).&amp;nbsp; I just now have 200ked in Emerald Jungle while running to Trakanon.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have double the skill I used to have when the cap was 94 and am 20king in areas that I never in hundreds (in the case of Kelethin) of jump have not 20ked.&amp;nbsp; Is there now a random chance to 20k from any large fall?&amp;nbsp; I could understand if the fall was such as the Hole or the cliffs near Howling Stones, but these are not that distance of falls.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you for looking into this and I have also submitted a bug report in game.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Rappin' Rogue Revealed.. Unconcealed.. but still keepin' it real</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Rogue&amp;message.id=4338#M4338</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I've read a lot of the stuff here, but not all. I may not offer any new ideas, but I will mention what my own personal preferences are for rogues, and some of the things that I think ought to be done (or should have been done long ago). As far as I am concerned, rogues are a broken class at this point and there is no question that there needs to be *major* changes to the class or to the game itself in order for them to be a class worth playing on a full time basis.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So.. starting with that caveat.. the main problem with rogues as I see it is that their only consistent and practical contribution to groups and raids is: DPS. (They are one-hit wonders....) Which, of course, is not a problem when they are far and away the best DPS class.. which, of course, they are not. Other classes have close to, and, in many cases, more DPS than rogues do (without the wonder part).. but their contributions don't end there.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So.. since we have been forbidden to make an argument for more DPS, we are left with ways in which rogues can contribute beyond DPS, that could be equivalent to the ways in which other high DPS classes contribute. All right.. just to get an idea of what kind of gap, or deficit, we are looking at in non-dps abilities.. let me suggest that:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rogues be given the ability to slow undead, to rez fallen companions, to heal the group with a clicky orb that they can summon, to singlehandedly do Nest and various other DoD missions; be given a pet (that we can use to pull singles with, and off tank adds with), cast Disease/Poison Resists/Levitation buffs, summon corpses, self-evac with no timer or need to be sneak/hidden, snare, root, give other classes mana, gate, cast short term group wide attack buffs, debuff mobs, a free ability to lose all aggro through feign death, pull mobs via feign death, oh... and to open up TWO chests on the MPG Subversion Trial.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So, would SoE consider giving those abilities to rogues? No.. that would be *RIDICULOUS* wouldn't it? To give a class with the *highest* dps in *many* situations all of THAT, &lt;U&gt;TOO&lt;/U&gt;!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(Oh by the way, and I'm NOT asking for &lt;U&gt;MORE&lt;/U&gt; DPS here, could you just make it so AE Rampage and mob 'push' has little to no effect upon our DPS output? And make it so our existing DPS output is not mitigated by any drain we put upon a healer's time and mana on raids?) --Yes, a few mobs are resistant --&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They couldn't give us all of those abilities anyway, because they belong to another class. Now.. let's look at what rogues can do.. *besides* DPS.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Picking pockets and locks, disarming traps, Sneak/Hide, Escape, ability to self-evac, and a short term (6 second?) mez. Poisons. The ability to set a "trap".&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;How much do these abilities contribute practically speaking?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Very little, in my opinion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Pockets are not worth picking. There are few, if any missions, where picking pockets is required, helpful, or even *possible* in order to complete it. When I got past level 20, I've used the skill twice (both as a required part of the rogue epic).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Locks are rumored to exist in Everquest, but are believed to be limited to only the remotest of zones, and to be guarded by vicious, green conning rats, frogloks, and skeletons. Occasionally, one will receive an urgent tell requesting your assistance in picking such a lock in &amp;lt;insert remote, middle of nowhere zone&amp;gt;. This, along with dragging corpses, is one of the few shining moments in the life of a serious Assassin. Well, there's always subversion trial.. oh.. but we can only open up ONE. :(&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;"Traps, traps.. everywhere traps!.. Careful guys.. don't MOVE!.. I'm serious.. My spider senses are tingling.. I sense a trap in THIS direction! /me points!"&lt;BR&gt;Traps.. ahh.. the traps.. so CRITICAL to the work of a rogue.. that we were blessed with a new 12 AA ability in order to detect them. Thank Bristlebane! I'll let y'all know if I find any.. I'm ALWAYS looking! :-)!!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sneak/Hide is useful, at least relative to our other abilities which have next to no use. and is certainly something that contributes to adventuring in EQ. It is rather &lt;I&gt;limited&lt;/I&gt; in it's uses, but it is at least *fairly* useful.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Escape is cool. It's on a timer, so it's not *particularly* useful. Can pull (once every 15 minutes or so) if you get a lucky split... but it's no feign death.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Self-evac is also cool. It's set on a long timer, that can be used only under the condition that you are not currently being attacked, and that you have been hidden for a certain amount of time, but.. you can use it to get out of some situation and for traveling... but it's no Levant.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;ASSASSIN'S FEINT.. ooooh!.. Ahhhh!.. Hell yeah! Time to get SERIOUS about our roles as the ASSASSINS of Norrath! Oh.. see.. I saw the word Assasssin and... well.. nm.. Rogues can mez a mob for a short period of time. And honestly, I like it, to a degree. It *has* it's uses. It can interrupt some mobs casting gate.. it can help buy the enchanter or necro (who can kite adds) or whoever.. the time to deal with the add. It's also good for when you *want* to get aggro. It's kind of cool.. It was useful on creators, but now I do nests.. and on Nests.. it has no use whatsoever. This is also true of the rogue's ability to assassinate.. was really cool back in Sebilis.. but at level 70 is next to useless. Unlike Assassinate, however, rogue mez is not necessarily "roguelike".. at the very least.. it's a bit of a stretch. But.. I still found it very useful in DoN and to a certain extent now.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Poisons.. another staple of rogues.. as far as their contributions beyond DPS (itself rather limited) is.. well.. rather limited. I think there's a mob that can only be slowed by a rogue poison or something, but I haven't personally dealth with it. I've spent a fair amount of time making them, but can't really think of many contributions they make.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Oooh.. TRAPS.. TRAPS.. TRAPS.. and NOW.. rogues have their very OWN! We can be ASSASSINS now! Well... as excited as *I* was initially about our trap.. I now see it more as a cute gag to play on raids and in groups. Easy laughs.. good times.. good times.. Apparently, they prefer that the necromancer remain on snare duty.. and that I should focus my efforts more on standing behind the mobs and backstabbing them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In fact.. even with all of those abilities I mentioned.. 95% of the time.. that's all that I'm asked to do as a rogue.. stand behind it.. and backstab it. Sometimes I'll drag a corpse (for the fd necro to rez), scout ahead (backstabbing the Eye of Zemm otw), do a stealthy turn in, etc.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the grand scheme of things, you take away a rogue's DPS and you've got a jackass with a lockpick in a world with few locks. You take away a necromancers DPS and they are *still* overpowered. That is the reality.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Please spare us this idea that rogues are being unreasonable in their dissatisfaction with their DPS.... as it is, relative to *other* abilities and contributions in this game. The deficit in rogues utility beyond DPS is ENORMOUS. If you do NOT give them an *enormous* DPS increase, then you will need to either *fundamentally* change the mechanics of this game in order to make traps and locks and pickpocketing, etc. *enormously* useful.. OR.. give Rogues *super powers* that allow them to do things that are of *enormous* value and utility.. but are utterly unroguelike.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Honestly, I am OK with not receiving an ENORMOUS DPS increase. Rogues are Assassins, but that doesn't necessarily mean they should always be the kings of DPS. If Oswald and Boothe MISSED.. then their DPS would have been rather low, wouldn't it? So, I'm ok with that... I think rogues *should* be able to assassinate higher level mobs.. *sometimes*.. like in the old days in Sebilis. But.. to be highest in sustained damage over time.. all the time.. that isn't necessarily what rogues *ought* to be, imo.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However.. are you *going* to make our poisons USEFUL? To actually have an *impact* on the game in a way that makes their use integral to being a rogue? Are you *going* to make our traps.. TRAPS? We are rogues, the undisputed &lt;I&gt;experts&lt;/I&gt; at traps.. and a *necromancer* who has *absolutely nothing* to do with traps in any way, shape, or form... gets a *trap* that does DPS, albeit limited? And the Assassin's trap snares? Are you going to program traps that are placed *randomly* (not fixed and predictable ones) in zones where a rogue would be of enormous use in disarming? Are you going to create missions that allow the possibility of stealth and the skilled pickpocketing of items in order to progress through them? Or perhaps items of real value that can be pickpocketed from various mobs in cities and various other zones across Norrath? More consistent with the idea of deception, trickery, and manipulation.. will you give rogues the ability to distract the attention of one mob so that the other mob can be pulled? (As in throwing a rock to make a noise of some kind that the mobs would go and investigate.. that seems roguelike to me).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Personally, I'm not interested in unroguelike *super powers* to create an artificial utility. Pulling makes sense to me.. whereas.. mezzing/crowd control does not. Instead of creating clever gimmiks like Beastlords and Berserkers and traps and breakable objects and all of the other advertised, underdeveloped features on your game boxes.. will you all actually take the time to change the nature of the game to accomdate rogues and their roguelike abilities? If so, I'm all for it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But if you &lt;I&gt;aren't&lt;/I&gt; going to do *that*.. which you have not done in the many years this game has been in existence then give us what you ALWAYS have.. until recently: DPS &lt;U&gt;mastery&lt;/U&gt;. Or give us Super Powers! But.. one way or another, you need to make rogues worth playing again. &lt;I&gt;My&lt;/I&gt; account will remain inactive while you all work out the details...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Shadowpiercer&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!--  / message  --&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Doing the clay golem part of the 1.5, after the patch, and I feel like I got slapped in the face. For some odd reason, Mistmoor got changed back to 65-70...&amp;nbsp; As a good Rogue, I still wandererd to where my mob Dark Huntress should have been just to make sure she wasn;t stuck there amid level 71 mobs.&amp;nbsp; After that, I went to L Fay to see if any of the Mistmoor mobs were outside of the zone like before.&amp;nbsp; Not one was.&amp;nbsp; If you want to mess zones up, and make them all for anyone 60+, (Blackburrow soon??) then PLEASE make it so what is needed can be obtained elsewhere.&amp;nbsp; I think there needs to be more planning and thouhgt in these patches, not just one every two weeks so it looks like you are trying.&amp;nbsp; I prefer the old mistmoor for the great exp it provided between Paludal and Echo caverns, how it teaches the game like Karnors, trains Galore, but has awesome camp spots...&amp;nbsp; Wither way, please fix the mobs.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Best AAs based on era?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Rogue&amp;message.id=4327#M4327</link>
      <description>I was looking over the rogue AAs and was thinking of the best bang for your buck in terms of AA progression. It won't be similar to the paths that people would take nowadays due to some AAs being unavailable till the proper expansion. What are your preferred AA paths for SoL? I was thinking run3/metab3 for general, combat fury 3 for archtype then ambidexterity followed by escape. After those I am not sure. Probably chaotic stab and then do the archtype stuff and physical enhancement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is your preferred AA route?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Hubby and I are duoing alot lately and both of our mains are rogues&#xD;
(trying to get my rogue up to his level), is there any place that we&#xD;
can hunt that will give me experience at 58 and not let us die too&#xD;
much? Money is also a bonus, but not a requirement.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Healing potions and such are not an option, so any healing will be the&#xD;
good old sitting kind. And most of the time we don't have buffs unless&#xD;
there's been a MGB in PoK.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
I'm level 58 and he's 66.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
So, is there any place that we can go?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Oh, and we do an occasional MM with our third account (very low level toon) but those get tiring quick.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Rogue Useable Leather Armor</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Rogue&amp;message.id=4316#M4316</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Any reason why there hasnt been any recent leather graphic armor useable by rogues introduced??&amp;nbsp; I do realize I am in the minority asking about this so dont really expect a reply. The only high end item that&amp;nbsp;fits this description post Luclin is the Padded Tigerskin Gloves from Cazic Thule in Time.&amp;nbsp; There were a couple of items added in the Droga Revamp, which I am currently using on my rogue, but that is about it.&amp;nbsp; I have gone out of my way to get leather graphic items for most of the visible slots but some leave much to be desired. Would be nice to be able to choose my armor based on roleplay preferences rather than forced amor archetypes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am in no way saying I hate the forced archetypes, as they are very beneficial to preventing rotting armor pieces.&amp;nbsp; I would just like via maybe quest or other ways(new items introduced) to be able to equip more recent leather armor.&amp;nbsp; Remember before Everquest, rogues/thieves in role playing games were restricted to leather armor because *gasp* heavier armor reduced movement and caused other issues with roguely activities.&amp;nbsp; I realize this game is different but why shouldnt a rogue be able to equip leather armor??&amp;nbsp; Note, for the eventual question of why x class cant use x armor, I am not asking to use something that is against the class(like cloth classes using Plate). Rogues CAN wear leather armor. Yes it wont give as much AC bonus as chain, but I am OK with that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Solutions could be as simple as having an NPC change out class specific armor(velious, ornate, elemental, OOW, Qvic, etc) and dropping them to the AC stats of leather classes. Or, perhaps have a couple nodrop items to get and then hand in the class specific armor for a leather version from a quest NPC.&amp;nbsp; And remember, if you dont like it, you dont have to do it. =)&amp;nbsp; I am sure I cant be the only player in EQ who would like to have a rogue use leather armor without hurting the abilities of the&amp;nbsp;character too much.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="" target=_blank&gt;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1295609&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;would be the rogue's current magelo.&amp;nbsp; Reason for chain gloves is that there are no leather gloves obtainable by a non-VT/SSRA raiding rogue with more than 30 HP on them. I would gladly upgrade to PTSG from Time if given the chance(and 5 more levels)....&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
