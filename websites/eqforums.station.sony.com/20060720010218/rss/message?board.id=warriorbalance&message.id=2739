&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **Zowie**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;DONE&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; - increase skill cap for piercing&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal 0pt? 0in **Zowie**?MARGIN:&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Taunt.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Success rate, particularly the steep decline vs. Yellow/Red mobs, is too low and too unreliable &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated),&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;taunting when OOR causes taunt button to grey out &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(fix for this should be going on Test in mid-October)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Update:&amp;nbsp; Moved to top of list.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is currently the most pressing issue with the warrior community.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; There is no other skill which has such a lousy scaling of the success rate based on mob level as taunt.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Re-Evaluate Epic 1.5/2.0 Effect &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;(New)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Details and a discussion to follow.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Endurance Regen:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We need endurance regen from Spells and/or items.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Modrods should provide an endurance benefit equal to the mana benefit.&amp;nbsp; Also, change + Endurance only augments to +Endurance regen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; reimplement the ability to /disc to see the refresh timer on discs &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Re-Evaluate warrior disciplines.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;(New)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;There's a few issues:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;A. Endurance costs on all of the new&amp;nbsp;discs is WAY too high&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;B. Aura of Runes negates the use of inherent proc right clicks.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Please consider "suspending" them rather than dispelling them completely.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;C. The level 70 discipline needs to be effective against even con and higher mobs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If it's not reasonable to make level 70+ mobs stunnable (and it's probably not reasonable), then change the effect to a dramatic defensive based damage shield (DD)&amp;nbsp;effect, or a "defensive" hate inducing proc, or something along those lines.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As it currently stands, there's not a whole lot of use for the discipline which SHOULD be our best.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;D. Savage onslaught needs a longer timer or shorter refresh and a MUCH lower endurance upkeep.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;6.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Increase the effectiveness of duel wielding weapons &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;7.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Add a shield disc or shield usefulness &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(no change planned at this time) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;[possibly addressed in Omens - partially anyway]&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The following are helpful suggestions as to what can be adjusted to shields to make them something desired.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Above all, when it comes to shields, we want the option to use them for a noticeable benefit.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Adjust the effect of Furious Bash, to make it either a standard proc, or a percentage hate modifier.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The concept isn't to make shields as good at aggro as dual wielding or using a 2 hand weapon, but to make them a viable option with some tangible benefit.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Add Shielding or block to shields&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Warrior shields result in a larger DPS decrease than knight shields do based on the nature of knight weapons vs. warrior weapons.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A warrior equipped shield should add a +damage modifier to his/her main hand weapon so that when using a shield, the DPS balance continues to exist.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Shields equippable by tanks should exceed dramatically the stats gained with an offhand weapon.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 30AC and 50hp arent' enough benefit to the loss of aggro and damage that occurs when a shield is equipped&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;UPDATE:&amp;nbsp; The real issues at this time is aggro generation comparatively with other classes who have this AA ability, who have taken dramatic strides toward tanking parity with us due to Omens launch and content, &amp;nbsp;we take a much larger hit in aggro generation than others, as well as the availability of good main hand only weapons to make the shield AA useful&amp;nbsp; for those without BBoB/Darkblade/Fleshbiter&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;8.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Improve stun from kick/slam &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Update:&amp;nbsp; Please advise the newest maximum stun level for kick/bash&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;9.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Melee Focus Effects:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The current level of melee foci are too limited.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; There are no mage summonned melee foci, and melee foci were not retroactively placed on older gear.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The current list of foci is also too limited in what it acheives when compared with caster foci.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;10.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; balance bash damage to the weapon &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Note: This is likely to be merged with the shield issue next update&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;1. Aggro:&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A. Taunt success Rate, particularly against even con mobs and higher is abysmal. We understand that there is a fix in the works, can we get an estimated time? Also, can we get a notification that it's on test that we may perform the necessary testing to ensure that it's appropriate prior to going live?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;B. Taunt Greying out on Out of Range: This has been said to have been something which was supposed to be being fixed, when is this going to happen?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;C. Initial aggro limitations: This is becoming a serious issue for warriors See the following for more detailed information.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Paladin generated hate from spells&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1800 (1 sec cast, 12 sec recast) 100m (Ancient force of jeron)&lt;BR&gt;1400 (2 sec cast, 24 sec recast) 250m (Serene command)&lt;BR&gt;1600 (1 sec cast, 12 sec recast) 80m (Force of Piety)&lt;BR&gt;1200(est) (1.5 sec cast, 9 sec recast) 15m (Cease)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In 30 seconds, one could cast.... intentially low estimates, a good Paladin could cast at least 1 more of each of the force spells.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2x Ancient force&lt;BR&gt;2x Force of piety&lt;BR&gt;1x Serene command&lt;BR&gt;2x Cease&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For a total of: 10600 hate in casts only for 640 mana.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Shadowknight hate generated from spells&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A SK can cast &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1800AE, no Mez Break (3 sec cast, 30 sec recast) 150m (Dread Gaze)&lt;BR&gt;1800 Hate (1.5 sec cast, 6 sec recast) 60m (Terror of discord)&lt;BR&gt;Whole series of other spells such as clinging darkness, etc &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3x Terror of Discord&lt;BR&gt;1x Dread Gaze&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Total of 7200 hate for 330 mana (not counting misc hate generating spells, which can easily be added in as necessary)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Warrior generated hate:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;600 (+100/tick for 10 ticks, instant) 350END (Bazu bellow)&lt;BR&gt;1000AE + Melee damage (instant, limitations on use due to mez breaking) 605 END (Cyclone Blade)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Total of 2100 hate for 955 END&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The default is 1100 hate total, 600 in initial chunk for 305 END, and cyclone if needed, lately it's usually needed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It's one thing to have 1/5th to 1/10th of the aggro potential of your competitors for groups, it's entirely another to have it at such a high cost for the resource used, and have the resource used regenerate at a lower rate than the competitor's. It's kind of a "triple penalty", and furthermore, after the initial part is used up, we're "stuck", and cannot compensate at all in the event of a catastrophic aggro loss, especially in the condition taunt is in. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;While one can advise aggro management, it's simply not fair for such "aggro management" to only need to be applied to only one of the 3 tank classes, or for the spread in the ability to generate hate to be so far apart. The tanking advantage is nowhere near that in favor of warriors. The aggro disadvantage should be inverse to the tanking advantage.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is further compounded with the advent of Touch of Draygun, and the proliferation of Echo of Anger 4 belts for all 3 classes, which brought Paladins and SK's up to warriors' modified levels, when they already had an enormous lead on warriors in initial aggro. Widening the gap in initial aggro is not a desirable thing, but that's been happenning lately to a degree that puts warriors at a tremendous disadvantage. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The other aggro issue is stagnation in weaponry, but that will be covered under the weaponry entry in the top 10 list.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2. Endurance Regen: We need endurance regen from Spells and/or items. Modrods should provide an endurance benefit equal to the mana benefit. Also, change + Endurance only augments to +Endurance regen. Particularly crucial in this is post-resurrection/looting endurance regen. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be&amp;nbsp;considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Additional Notes: With the current aggro stagnation warriors have had, we use cyclone blade more and more often lately on single targets, which really drains our endurance in single groups. The endurance costs along with the downtime involved in regenerating the endurance, makes us the least effective tank when it comes to constant killing. Please address endurance costs for aggro skills.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3. Re-Evaluate warrior disciplines. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be&amp;nbsp;considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;There's a few issues: &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A. Endurance costs on all of the new discs is WAY too high (Part of the proposed first pass with class re-envisioning posted on EQLive on 3/14/2005)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;B. Aura of Runes negates the use of inherent proc right clicks. Please consider "suspending" them rather than dispelling them completely. Furthermore, the rate of fire is too low for it to be worth the endurance spent. Also, please unlink from healing will. being penalized in downtime for invoking something which allows you to survive a fight shouldn't happen.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;C. The level 70 discipline needs to be effective against even con and higher mobs. If it's not reasonable to make level 70+ mobs stunnable (and it's probably not reasonable), then change the effect to a dramatic defensive based damage shield (DD) effect, or a "defensive" hate inducing proc, or something along those lines. As it currently stands, there's not a whole lot of use for the discipline which SHOULD be our best. If, as part of the "re-envisioning", stuns work on targets even level or higher, then it needs to fire a LOT more often than it does in order to be useful.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;D. Savage onslaught needs a longer timer or shorter refresh and a MUCH lower endurance upkeep.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Update: Please let us know if the "Cleave" effect is working with Savage Onslaught.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4. Warriors need to be distinguished in durability in single group content from knights (and by extension, other classes).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;!-- / message --&gt;&lt;!-- sig --&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This has gotten a little better in Depths, but the issue of crit heal AA's working with Reptile skin giving knights (at least Paladins) another advantage when grouping with druids, aside from the complimentary buffset.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5. Shields: Please give warriors a reason to use a shield. Either in "one handed" non dual wielding weapons, or a modifier to one handed weapon damage when a shield is equipped, warriors don't like having a 5% "mitigation' advantage while giving up a 5% avoidance advantage to classes who can contribute in their own survivability, simply because only one class is rendered impotent while using a shield, and the other two aren't.&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;!-- / message --&gt;&lt;!-- sig --&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;6. Availability of weapons upgrades across the board: &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A. Non-raiding warriors are really suffering from a lack of viable upgrades that aren't inferior to older weapon choices. Particularly true is the dilemma that warriors in groups are essentially using the same weapons as other dual wielding DPS classes, and there's nothing that's really warrior oriented in single group acquirable weaponry that's current. There really needs to be some movement in weaponry. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;B. Raiding warriors have been waiting some 4 expansions for an upgrade to the Brutish Blade of Balance, or an offhandable warrior oriented weapon. The issue is that we're seeing is that we're being viewed as a generic dual wielding DPS class, and we're not. We're a tank class with needs that differ from rangers, rogues, monks, beastlords, and bards. We have defensive and aggro needs that supercede our offensive needs. Each "upgrade" to the Brutish Blade isn't really an upgrade at all. It's more of an upgrade in one of three areas. For instance, the Notched Blade of Bloodletting is a DPS upgrade, the proc is a downgrade, and the defensive stats are a large downgrade from the brutish blade. The same is true of the only other real alternative, Swiftcleave. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Warriors do not feel it's appropriate to put "warrior" on regular DPS weapons and consider us "itemized for". If there's daggers with Backstab mods, Bows with Archery mods, weapons with instrument mods, there should be something that makes a warrior "the desired" class if a warrior only weapon isn't a viable option (and we do not see why it isn't a viable option).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;7. Mob Summonning Issues: Please make it so that mobs summon rather than in the exact center of their hitbox, in front of them. Being summonned "out of melee range" and turning the mobs all over the place is incredibly frustrating, or better yet make mobs who have been attempted to have been taunted in the last 10 seconds stop summonning. The concept that we're standing in the face of a mob attacking and taunting should be clear indication that we're not trying "to evade" the mobs. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;8. Downward Scaling Tool: There is a point in EQ where because of the nature of certain spells (Stuns, Tap AA's), warriors take a back seat to Knights of their level at taking melee damage. In order to remain competitive, warriors need a low end, downward scaling tool which relives this. All of warriors' current tools become more effective the harder the content, but we lack a tool which has strength in weaker content. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;9. Warriors have been historically an "anti-magic" class, we would like some more innate magical defenses than simply a few points of MR. At higher levels, especially with the vet AA infusion, this is not a meaningful addition. Things we would like to see are things like innate spellshield of 10% to magic based spells at level 70, innate dispel resistance chance, a higher than cap magic resist and other such anti-magic resistances, even via class only AA. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Warrior gear is quite short on spellshield mods and surprisingly, magic resist, and we'd like to have our innate magic resistance mean something.&amp;nbsp; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;10. Augments: The addition of vendor based DoN proc augments was great, but there's still a lack of dropped augments, or upgraded effect augments from dropped mobs. This was supposed to have been added in DoN, but none have been found yet. We'd like to see a greater range of dropped hate generating augments.&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One further thing on augments. With the proliferation of all/all enraging blow augments and chaotic strike augments, and people who use them, the "advantage" to warrior specific aggro augments has decreased steadily, leading back to the old aggro issue. Warriors need some specific warrior only aggro augments which are qualitatively better than others can have access to. &lt;!-- / message --&gt;&lt;!-- sig --&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

If it's not reasonable to make level 70+ mobs stunnable (and it's probably not reasonable), then change the effect to a dramatic defensive based damage shield (DD) effect, or a "defensive" hate inducing proc, or something along those lines. As it currently stands, there's not a whole lot of use for the discipline which SHOULD be our best. If, as part of the "re-envisioning", stuns work on targets even level or higher, then it needs to fire a LOT more often than it does in order to be useful.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;D.

Warriors need to be distinguished in durability in single group content from knights (and by extension, other classes). Currently, with content being continually tuned downwards, there's nothing which distinguishes warriors from Knights except a lack of ancillary skills. This is particularly true in "non-standard" group configurations (with druids/shamans as primary healers), where knight self-buffs/spells give a tremendous advantage *even in tankability*. Being disadvantaged in durability is unacceptable to warriors who dont' have the luxury of ancillary skills to fall back upon.&lt;STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;!-- / message --&gt;&lt;!-- sig --&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;5. Shields: Please give warriors a reasont o use a shield. Either in "one handed" non dual wielding weapons, or a modifier to one handed weapon damage when a shield is equipped, warriors don't like having a 5% "mitigation' advantage while giving up a 5% avoidance advantage to classes who can contribute in their own survivability, simply because only one class is rendered impotent while using a shield, and the other two aren't.&lt;STRONG&gt; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;6.

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;7. Mob Summonning Issues: Please make it so that mobs summon rather than in the exact center of their hitbox, in front of them. Being summonned "out of melee range" and turning the mobs all over the place is incredibly frustrating, or better yet make mobs who have been attempted to have been taunted in the last 10 seconds stop summonning.

Warriors are extremely weak in all of these areas, not just "one mob DPS vs. one warrior DPS", and any reasonable soloing needs to take these factors into account, not just 'how to make one mob able to be killed by one warrior".&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; (currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

If, as part of the "re-envisioning", stuns work on targets even level or higher, then it needs to fire a LOT more often than it does in order to be useful.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;D. Savage onslaught needs a longer timer or shorter refresh and a MUCH lower endurance upkeep.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Update: Please let us know if the "Cleave" effect is working with Savage Onslaught.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4. Warriors need to be distinguished in durability in single group content from knights (and by extension, other classes). Currently, with content being continually tuned downwards, there's nothing which distinguishes warriors from Knights except a lack of ancillary skills. This is particularly true in "non-standard" group configurations (with druids/shamans as primary healers), where knight self-buffs/spells give a tremendous advantage *even in tankability*. Being disadvantaged in durability is unacceptable to warriors who dont' have the luxury of ancillary skills to fall back upon. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;!-- / message --&gt;&lt;!-- sig --&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5. Shields: Please give warriors a reasont o use a shield. Either in "one handed" non dual wielding weapons, or a modifier to one handed weapon damage when a shield is equipped, warriors don't like having a 5% "mitigation' advantage while giving up a 5% avoidance advantage to classes who can contribute in their own survivability, simply because only one class is rendered impotent while using a shield, and the other two aren't. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;6. Availability of weapons upgrades across the board: Non-raiding warriors are really suffering from a lack of viable upgrades that aren't inferior to 6 expansion old weapons with a recommended level 16 levels below the current "weapon of choice". There really needs to be some movement in weaponry. &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;7. Mob Summonning Issues: Please make it so that mobs summon rather than in the exact center of their hitbox, in front of them. Being summonned "out of melee range" and turning the mobs all over the place is incredibly frustrating, or better yet make mobs who have been attempted to have been taunted in the last 10 seconds stop summonning. The concept that we're standing in the face of a mob attacking and taunting should be clear indication that we're not trying "to evade" the mobs. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;8. Soloing: Being able to solo isn't just being able to endure the beating of a single target at a time, but rather lots of other stuff, such as being able to get to the area where experience happens, being able to engage a single mob, being able to have a contingency plan to deal with adds, being able to have en escape mechanism when things go awry, also there's the matter of downtime between kills. Warriors are extremely weak in all of these areas, not just "one mob DPS vs. one warrior DPS", and any reasonable soloing needs to take these factors into account, not just 'how to make one mob able to be killed by one warrior".&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt; (currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;9.&amp;nbsp; Warriors have been historically an "anti-magic" class, we would like some more innate magical defenses than simply a few points of MR. At higher levels, this is not a meaningful addition. Things we would like to see are things like innate spellshield of 10% at level 70, innate dispel resistance, and other such anti-magic resistances. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;10. Augments: The addition of vendor based DoN proc augments was great, but there's still a lack of dropped augments, or upgraded effect augments from dropped mobs. This was supposed to have been added in DoN, but none have been found yet. We'd like to see a greater range of dropped hate generating augments.&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

Taunt Greying out on Out of Range: This has been said to have been something which was supposed to be being fixed, when is this going to happen?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2.

Aura of Runes negates the use of inherent proc right clicks. Please consider "suspending" them rather than dispelling them completely. Furthermore, the rate of fire is too low for it to be worth the endurance spent. Also, please unlink from healing will. being penalized in downtime for invoking something which allows you to survive a fight shouldn't happen.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;C.

&lt;P&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Taunt.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Success rate, particularly the steep decline vs. Yellow/Red mobs, is too low and too unreliable &lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be&amp;nbsp;considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;2. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;LDoN, Hate Augments, and Warriors:&amp;nbsp; There really needs to be some dropped hate generating weapon proc augments.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It's not only mobs who hate us after having spent days/weeks grinding out obsolete, unsupported expansions to "complete" our weapons.&amp;nbsp; Our guilds&amp;nbsp;do too.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; All other augment types found in LDoN are found elsewhere in OOW or even tradeskilled, even some weapon augments are dropped (Such as Taskfiend Caikip's lifetap augment).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;(New)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Endurance Regen:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We need endurance regen from Spells and/or items.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Modrods should provide an endurance benefit equal to the mana benefit.&amp;nbsp; Also, change + Endurance only augments to +Endurance regen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be&amp;nbsp;considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;There's a few issues:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;A. Endurance costs on all of the new&amp;nbsp;discs is WAY too high&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Update:&amp;nbsp; At the Fan Faire, during the Q and A, Rytan said that he'd be willing to look into this when discussing how the endurance system was created when he pointed out that&amp;nbsp;the costs on the older discs to justify not adding endurance regen into the mix of things, but the new disciplines are significantly more costly with a lower "return" than the older discs, and their costs needs to be looked into.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;B. Aura of Runes negates the use of inherent proc right clicks.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Please consider "suspending" them rather than dispelling them completely.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Update:&amp;nbsp; Warriors report that it's not firing as often as they would expect, particularly for the Endurance cost&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;C. The level 70 discipline needs to be effective against even con and higher mobs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If it's not reasonable to make level 70+ mobs stunnable (and it's probably not reasonable), then change the effect to a dramatic defensive based damage shield (DD)&amp;nbsp;effect, or a "defensive" hate inducing proc, or something along those lines.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As it currently stands, there's not a whole lot of use for the discipline which SHOULD be our best.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;D. Savage onslaught needs a longer timer or shorter refresh and a MUCH lower endurance upkeep.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Update:&amp;nbsp; Warriors would like an inherent critical hit modifier built into Savage Onslaught, also please let us know if the "Cleave" effect is working with Savage Onslaught.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Range attack while pulling &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be&amp;nbsp;considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Note: The proliferation of ranged items which eliminate the use of a bow or thrown item without awkward item swapping, it is requested that the 'Throw Stone" skill be unlinked from the incite line, and a longer range placed on it (100ish feet)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;6.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Saved Weapon Sets:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A few months ago, casters got the ability to save spellsets, which was rather convenient and not necessarily game breaking.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Rather than digging through bags and having the clumsiness of swapping weapons out the way it currently stands, to have the ability to have a known weapon setup weapons which you switch to when needed. This should include Primary, Secondary and range/Ammo sets, and should be available not only to warriors, but to all classes, after all, all classes have primary, secondary and range slots.&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(New)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;7.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Mob Summonning Issues:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Please make it so that mobs summon rather&amp;nbsp;than in the&amp;nbsp;exact center of their hitbox,&amp;nbsp;in front of them.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Being&amp;nbsp;summonned "out of melee range" and turning the mobs all over the place is incredibly frustrating, or better yet make mobs who have been attempted to have been taunted in the last&amp;nbsp;10 seconds stop summonning.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The concept that we're standing in the face of&amp;nbsp;a mob attacking and&amp;nbsp;taunting should be clear indication that we're not&amp;nbsp;trying "to evade" the mobs.&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(New)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;8.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Melee Focus Effects:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The current level of melee foci are too limited.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; There are no mage summonned melee foci, and melee foci were not retroactively placed on older gear.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The current list of foci is also too limited in what it acheives when compared with caster foci.&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be&amp;nbsp;considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;9.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "3rd attack" which performs a melee interrupt which is not subject to the weak kick miss rate, such as "Crippling Strike" (At-Will Crippling Blow once per&amp;nbsp;6-12 seconds or so) when using a 2 handed weapon, or 2 hand bash.&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#00ccff&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(Updated)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;10.&amp;nbsp; Increase the pushback on "Press the Attack" and the chance to interrupt on it. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be&amp;nbsp;considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Update:&amp;nbsp; At the Fan Faire, during the Q and A, Rytan said that he'd be willing to look into this when discussing how the endurance system was created when he pointed out that&amp;nbsp;the costs on the older discs to justify not adding endurance regen into the mix of things, but the new disciplines are significantly more costly with a lower "return" than the older discs, and their costs needs to be looked into.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;B. Aura of Runes negates the use of inherent proc right clicks.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Please consider "suspending" them rather than dispelling them completely.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Update:&amp;nbsp; Warriors report that it's not firing as often as they would expect, particularly for the Endurance cost&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;C. The level 70 discipline needs to be effective against even con and higher mobs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If it's not reasonable to make level 70+ mobs stunnable (and it's probably not reasonable), then change the effect to a dramatic defensive based damage shield (DD)&amp;nbsp;effect, or a "defensive" hate inducing proc, or something along those lines.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As it currently stands, there's not a whole lot of use for the discipline which SHOULD be our best.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;D. Savage onslaught needs a longer timer or shorter refresh and a MUCH lower endurance upkeep.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Update:&amp;nbsp; Please let us know if the "Cleave" effect is working with Savage Onslaught.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Range attack while pulling &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be&amp;nbsp;considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Note: The proliferation of ranged items which eliminate the use of a bow or thrown item without awkward item swapping, it is requested that the 'Throw Stone" skill be unlinked from the incite line, and a longer range placed on it (100ish feet)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;6.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The following adjustimets to /shield to make it more useful.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;(New)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Since it already has significant limitations to it's use (duration/reuse/no disc usage) please reconsider the "damage penalty" aspect, to make it 50/50, or based on the warrior's mitigation, not the target's. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Assist shield:&amp;nbsp; Please enable the ability to simply assist the NPC we're fighting to perform the /shield operation.&amp;nbsp; The current process is too clumsy. &#xD;
&lt;LI&gt;Give it a real hotbutton, not a text command.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;7.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Mob Summonning Issues:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Please make it so that mobs summon rather&amp;nbsp;than in the&amp;nbsp;exact center of their hitbox,&amp;nbsp;in front of them.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Being&amp;nbsp;summonned "out of melee range" and turning the mobs all over the place is incredibly frustrating, or better yet make mobs who have been attempted to have been taunted in the last&amp;nbsp;10 seconds stop summonning.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The concept that we're standing in the face of&amp;nbsp;a mob attacking and&amp;nbsp;taunting should be clear indication that we're not&amp;nbsp;trying "to evade" the mobs.&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0033ff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;8.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Melee Focus Effects:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The current level of melee foci are too limited.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; There are no mage summonned melee foci, and melee foci were not retroactively placed on older gear.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The current list of foci is also too limited in what it acheives when compared with caster foci.&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be&amp;nbsp;considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;9.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "3rd attack" which performs a melee interrupt which is not subject to the weak kick miss rate, such as "Crippling Strike" (At-Will Crippling Blow once per&amp;nbsp;6-12 seconds or so) when using a 2 handed weapon, or 2 hand bash.&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#00ccff&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;10.&amp;nbsp; Increase the pushback on "Press the Attack" and the chance to interrupt on it. &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated) - Most likely this will be&amp;nbsp;considered as part of the class re-envisioning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;The next update to your class list will be 1/7/05 and will then be changed to updating on the first Friday of each month, so the next update will follow on 2/4/05 and so on.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Details:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Effect has 3 major issues:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;b. Cast time: Please change to instant&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Endurance Regen:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We need endurance regen from Spells and/or items.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Modrods should provide an endurance benefit equal to the mana benefit.&amp;nbsp; Also, change + Endurance only augments to +Endurance regen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;(currently being evaluated)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;6.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Add a shield disc or shield usefulness&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; (no change planned at this time) &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;The real issues at this time is aggro generation comparatively with other classes who have this AA ability, who have taken dramatic strides toward tanking parity with us due to Omens launch and content, &amp;nbsp;we take a much larger hit in aggro generation than others, as well as the availability of good main hand only weapons to make the shield AA useful&amp;nbsp; for those without BBoB/Darkblade/Fleshbiter&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
