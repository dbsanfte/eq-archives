      <description>&lt;div&gt;Talk about taking things out of context.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;First, the assumption based on branding would be that the person (not people posting) that has had a perceived bad experience whether a result of bad CS, QA, or they just like the game another way may result in them not purchasing a Sony product later in life.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;McDonald's, IBM, Ford, etc.... all have recognized this and try to develop brand loyalty through many means. Customer service and Quality Assurance are the most common methods other than advertising.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Second,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Since SoE will not divulge technical data, some assumption must be made based upon the context of their operation. The systems I dealt with serve thousands of people at any given moment, are constantly subject to change that may change the original code written, the code must be continually changed in order to accommodate changes in technology we can't control and to keep with new requests in functionality, and finally no down time is acceptable since our listeners are paying customers in the end run and will go elsewhere if we don't deliver.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Those parameters pretty much sum up what SoE should be doing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Third,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My only concession is that SoE does not value its customers to the same level as many other technically based operations usually do in my opinion, and therefore will never change. Inevitably leading to the down fall of this game since it now on the downward trend of its product life cycle.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Not that I buy into your circuitous commentary. It seems to me that the value it hasn't been done, we aren't sure how to do it, so why try or bother comes to mind when I read these kinds of posts.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In Conclusion:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My statements are made to stir up some controversy so maybe some things even minor ones may eventually be recognized and corrected. That is part of how things are changed. Not sitting idle and waiting for them to fail.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Go Last Word-itis go!!!!! (request cheering section included)&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff00ff&gt;Just like I said, "Last Word-itis".&lt;/FONT&gt; Since in the world of business not everything is based upon data but perception I will still lean towards Ruleras' comments. Based upon the perception that he/she has real world technical experience, and that you base your answers on possibility and the insinuation that you run a business.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Again, you are making statements on incomplete and un-verified information, you have no idea what my area of technical expertise is outside of business, you are assuming that I do not have any,&amp;nbsp;would love to see&amp;nbsp;your&amp;nbsp;logic tree for coming up with that guess , it would be interesting to see.&lt;/EM&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you read the beginning post it is based upon SoE's inability to create an air of good customer service as well as quality assurance, which will eventually lead a prospective buyer to lean towards another company's product when purchasing because of their perception of Sony.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Ah, the infamous Customer Service Posts - so what you are saying is that all business perception is based on 1 sided comments, the fact that you only see what the injuried party posts about their problem and we all know that those types of posts are truthful, and factual in every way, that the injuried party does not word their post in terms that makes them come out like the saint and SoE comes out like the devil incarnete&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Example 1, Widget Poster place a comment - SOE service is the pits, my account was hacked and sytolen and they will not help me, then goes on to make the poor me post about how he/she/it was a model player, etc, ad-nauseum. Now the real truth after it is investigted is the fact that WEidget Poster gave his Uid out to the entire server thus is in violation of the rules - but he gets the star for his post because he is th "injuried party"&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Example 2 - Widget the second posts about how he/she/it got {insert proper squeleched word here} by SoE because they did not get their petition closed to their liking so SoE is a "bad Compnay that does not care about their customers", now 5 days earlier they petitioned and got everything done to their liking, so prior to this one, so up until the current post, the CS with SOE was acceptable, now it is not, &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;what was the difference between&amp;nbsp;example 1 and&amp;nbsp;example 2? The only difference is&amp;nbsp;example 2 was filled to their liking, example 1 was ot, even though BOTH of them where handled according to posted rules, but since they did not get what they wanted the CS of the company is bad. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Again, he/she is dead on with the line concerning the purchase of a big screen and how it may be affected by that purchasers perception&amp;nbsp; from how he was treated by Sony (SoE) in the past.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Again, see the preceeding response, perception of being treated depends on the outcome of the issue, if you got what you wanted, then the preception of the company if sainthood, if you did not then it is the devil incarnete, even though all incidents where handled within the confines of the Terms of Service. There is not one MMORPG on the market, past or present that has not been or will ever be accused of "poor service" because the accuser does not get what he/she/it wants, the perception of being unfairly treated will be there if the results was not exactly what he/she/it wanted&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Marketing&amp;nbsp;and Business 101 cover product branding and its outcome.&amp;nbsp; SoE's current product life cycle is on a downward trend and will crash unless a revitalization is done soon.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;If that is what you believe after a careful examination of documented facts, then I guess it is correct, who can argue with facts, personally I base my product branding on research and not word of mouth&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Ruleras recommended polling the client base at sign onto cut down on unnecessary developing of code that no one will need nore use. &amp;nbsp;That &amp;nbsp;takes no cost or technical knowledge of how&amp;nbsp;SoE runs things,&amp;nbsp;only a good sense of business.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;never mentjoned anything about it not being a bad idea, in fact I second the suggetion of that, but then remember once that poll is completed and the information compilied and given to management, it will probably never be published since it is company confidential, any changes that come of it will be viewed by the general populous as either being the "greatest thing since sliced bread" or "the most stupid idea ever created by mankind". so this solves what? Great example - the expansions, if you read the boards, there is mixed emotions, some love them, some hate them, it just depends on the perception of the recipient. There is absolutely no MMORPG on the market today, past present or future that everyone will agree on as being perfect, same with the customer service angle, there will always be a group of people that feel tehy are being neglected or shorted because things do not fite their ideal. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Question for you and Ruleras - how did the determination of the statement "&lt;U&gt;cut down on unnecessary developing of code that no one will need nore use&lt;/U&gt;" cme about, what exactly was it based on, this is personal but do not see anything in the game that is not being used by a segement of the player base.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;What can you add (WR)? All I have heard is non-productive comments.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Again, as I have stated before there is no verifiable information to base any suggestions on, How ca you accurately make any helpful suggestions to anybody if you are basing them on inaccurate data? But then again, you have done a great job of turning any reponses into a "Have you stopped beating your {insert appropriate word} yet" style, since any response made to you can be considered a "Last Word-itis" comment in your eyes, no matter if it is logical or emotional.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Starsabre1 wrote:&lt;p&gt;IMO, your thinking on this particular issue is being limted by the scope of your perspective. Smaller businesses must constantly control quality and cost because they cannot afford not to. I can't tell you how many bigger companies that I've worked for where they had neither the time, nor the manpower, to attend to every infantesimal issue not directly tied into overall performance. Smaller issues are sacrificed on the backdrop of the bigger picture. In smaller companies, everyone has to be a &amp;quot;general specialist.&amp;quot; People in larger companies end up specializing in far narrower areas of expertise. It may not be right, but there it is. Nothing you or I say on a forum about a particular MMORPG is going to change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you had read my posts I worked for the largest radio corporation in the world up til recently. We serviced over 1200 radio stations and managed to stay on top of things with technical upgrades with some of the most state of the art equipment short of a Kray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I did not take into account is that we were ready to devote huge financial resources to accomodate this. It was done with very little man power and military efficiency. It was a brutal place to work, hence I am not there anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have worked with Sony on many occasions and know the scope of their abilities and limitations. It seems to me that SoE might be the &amp;quot;Red-headed **SMURF** step-child&amp;quot; and is run by the US and not the Japanese. There is a big difference. They do have the resources to handle this game. They just are too short-sighted to handle it correctly IMO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that they are just using this as a &amp;quot;Cash Cow&amp;quot; and are not investing the time or money it requires to grow the product life cycle. The reintegration of the old servers instead of updating the gear is a good indicator of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This bothers me since I really like this game (you'd never know it from my b**ching).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I will keep my fingers crossed and hope for the best.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Ruleras:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;No apologies are necessary. I am one who usually &amp;quot;tilts at windmills&amp;quot; most of the time, in this instance however, I simply believe that this is a unique situation that is not comparable to others. Yet your frustrations with SOE and EQ do not seem to have reached the  point where you are willing to stop patronizing them, rather you want to keep insisting that they have the necessary resources to do what you believe is right regardless of the incompatibility of your comparisons.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The game is 7 years old, it is massive. Most of the people who originally programmed it are long gone. Those who are now programming it have to build upon the works of others. This in and of itself should indicate a huge nexus of variables and possibilities that is impossible to contend. Quality assurance on such a product would be a nightmare of epic perportions unlike anything either you or I has ever had to face.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Be that as it may, it may very well be that SOE as a corporate entity could choose to handle their customer relations in a better manner, but this does not mean that QA is not trying their best.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is not all the above just symptomatic of the whole home computer industry. We have softward that comes out that need patching to work, hardware that wont work or confilicts with other items, Customer services that feed canned uselesss responses, little ability for customers to actualy complain in a way that makes a difference (note the lack of any real SOE responce to this or thousands of other threads), and to get hold of customer services you have often to ring premium numbers for something that should be free (included in cost of the product).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would we buy any other product which would be so fault ridden. Would you buy a car, or even be able to buy a car, where the wheels may fall off unless you acquire the optional nuts?? Think the answer is NO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dont think there is a single answer to the real issues. I feel that it is just a case that the whole industry has become so disconnected from customers that they can do as much or as little as they wish to. Thats life, take it or leave it !!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Again let's stay away from the petty shots (What is a Kray so my spelling stinks?). It's sophomoric. And, since you have never worked in radio you may not realize that production (producing of commercials, news, audio elements are ever changing and subject the main and client servers to constant change and that we cannot control). Granted this is only audio and cannot truly compare to something that uses both audio and video but the principles are relatively the same.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color="#ff6600"&gt;Bottom line is this is not about how well we know systems, this is about how poorly SoE utilizes theirs&lt;/font&gt;, and how it will affect the future consumption of Sony products.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And if you re-read my last post you will see that &lt;font color="#66ff33"&gt;I have conceded that SoE is just not willing to devote the financial or staff resources needed to keep this game afloat long term in today's competitive market.&lt;/font&gt; Sooner or later a better mouse trap will come along and we will all be upset.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Again let's stay away from the petty shots (What is a Kray so my spelling stinks?). It's sophomoric. And, since you have never worked in radio you may not realize that production (producing of commercials, news, audio elements are ever changing and subject the main and client&amp;nbsp;servers to constant change and that we cannot control). Granted this is only audio and cannot truly compare to something that uses both audio and video but the principles are relatively the same.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff6600&gt;Bottom line is this is not about how well we know systems, this is about how poorly SoE utilizes theirs&lt;/FONT&gt;, and how it will affect the future consumption of Sony products.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And if you re-read my last post you will see that &lt;FONT color=#66ff33&gt;I have conceded that SoE is just not willing to devote the financial or staff resources needed to keep this game afloat long term in today's competitive market.&lt;/FONT&gt; Sooner or later a better mouse trap will come along and we will all be upset.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;like&amp;nbsp;you said, stay away from petty shots, unless you know me and what I did/do for a living before I retired twice you have no idea where I worked or what company I owned.&amp;nbsp; I am not belitting your talent, I am just pointing out that unless you work in the same environment and senario you technical expierence is not the same, no matter how much you try to draw comparisions you cannot begin to fully understand the complexity of the environment that the game runs in, neither can I. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;True bottom line is you have no hard facts on how SoE utilizes their resources, all you can do is speculate from your own observations, you have nothing based in hard documented facts on what their hardware, R&amp;amp;D and infrastructure budgets are or how they are distributed and allocated. At tis point, the whole thing is your opinion, myself and others have a different opinion, that is the bottom line. Unless you can come up with documented, verifiable facts then this who thing is pure speculation. As you point out - " &lt;FONT color=#66ff33&gt;I have conceded "&amp;nbsp; &lt;FONT color=#000000&gt;the key point is right there - I anything else is speculation. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you had read my posts I worked for the largest radio corporation in the world up til recently. We serviced over 1200 radio stations and managed to stay on top of things with technical upgrades with some of the most state of the art equipment short of a Kray.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What I did not take into account is that we were ready to devote huge financial resources to accomodate this.&amp;nbsp;It was done with very little man power and military efficiency. It was a brutal place to work, hence I am not there anymore.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I have worked with Sony on many occasions and know the scope of their abilities and limitations. It seems to me that SoE might be the "Red-headed **SMURF** step-child" and is run by the US and not the Japanese. There is a big difference. They do have the resources to handle this game. They just are too short-sighted to handle it correctly IMO.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It seems to me that they are just using this as a "Cash Cow" and are not investing the time or money it requires to grow the product life cycle. The reintegration of the old servers instead of updating the gear is a good indicator of this.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This bothers me since I really like this game (you'd never know it from my b**ching).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Well, I will keep my fingers crossed and hope for the best.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am sorry, but comparing your expierence with radio stations and their equipment is in no way shape or form relevant to the hardware layout that the worlds run on, the article I linked explains some of the challenges that they expierence. Would be willing to be that your applications did not actively go out and search for a free server to launch the process for when players zone into a new area. Also if you reread the responses that wehre made on your inquiry into what happened to the old equipment you will see that some of it was rotated to a test environment and some into the production environment, would be willing to bet it was not the older equipment that got installed into the production world servers. Again that is all speculation since there is no information available, curious did you read the article?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;What is a Kray? Or do you mean &lt;A href="http://www.cray.com/" target=_blank&gt;http://www.cray.com/&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp; these?&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>Some of the old machines were retired (they were old machines) some moved for internal use (Test, Beta and internal QA testing) and many were spread out over the rest of the servers to spread the load.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don't forget we have had 2 (3?) expansions come out since the server consolidation as well, and all those new zones and instances need machines to run them as well.</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You can do the search verification, but it was mentioned in the consolidation letters that the retired hardware would be intergrated into the remaining server farms that make up a single world.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without going into to detail. The system services over 1200 radio stations. It handles the on air content, the streaming content, the hi-def content, the traffic material, and much more. It runs 365/24/7, and at any given time has over 30,000 end users on it. Data and content are constantly being manipulated, edited, and operated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can't give much more detail since I would violate a non-disclosure agreement. I would say it gets a pretty good workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as Sony getting a piece of the pie. &lt;font color="#ff0099"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sony rarely makes any products any more&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/font&gt;they are a marketing machine. Open up your Sony cd player. You can replace the pioneer optics, the Fujitsu potentiometers, matsu**SMURF**a IC's, etc......&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, I do not wish to get in a pixxing match with you SS1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With over 30 years of engineering experience starting in bench work repair and moving onto RF engineering and networking I think I have a good grasp of what companies are and are not capable of handling. And I have have worked with Sony here and in Osaka Japan. Believe me SoE acts nothing like Sony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I only bring this up since I want to see the game succeed and continue. It has given me many years of enjoyment. The problem is that SoE on it's current business path will go Pfffft in about 2 years or less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to prevent that, and sitting on your proverbial thumbs and accepting their current state will not help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speak Up!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You are working in a dream environment that in no way shape or form matches what has to be dealt with by the developers of the game.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

If you find that these problems bother you so much that you can no longer enjoy the game no matter what your investment in time and money might be, you are probably better off not putting your good money after bad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;No I do not work for SoE, no where did I belittle his or her technical expertise in their field, if you read my responses correctly, my discussion is to the simple fact that unless you have personal expierence in the same configuration and know what issues occurr, all the informaiton that is related from&amp;nbsp; hardware/software configuration issues to the hardware/software cnfiguration issues that SoE expierence is pure speculation based in assumptions&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;He/she has offered numerous constructive criticisms toward SoE, yet you seem to have a bad case of "Last Word-itis" that &lt;FONT color=#00cccc&gt;contributes nothing to the positive outcome of fixing a game that is badly in need of repair.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Hmm, funny though discussion was a key factor here, but it appears you think that anyone who has a different opinion of the&amp;nbsp;this thread&amp;nbsp;is in the wrong and guilty of "last Word-itis". Funny how things are typecast quickly.&amp;nbsp;Sorry but if one of my&amp;nbsp;BA's came to me with a prospectus based in pure speculation as this discussion is they would be on the street or back to basic data gathering assignments.&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I do know as a marketing director that SoE needs some serious lessons in business, and that he/she is dead on with the branding comments.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I&lt;EM&gt; do know as a business owner that unless you have documented facts to base any comments on that they are just that -&amp;nbsp;pure speculation and what if. In my line of work I deal if documented facts, not comments with no backup documentation.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now please tell us as this grand wizard of technology and business &lt;FONT color=#00ccff&gt;what you would do to improve the game and its current reputation ?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;I&lt;EM&gt; don't have it, have no way of investigating the facts, no idea what the budget is for salaries, R&amp;amp;D, hardware, do not have access to any data that is factual to provide a answer, my business is based in fact/logic and not speculation, without that there is no way to create a viable accurate business model ro base any changes suggestions on. I do not agree or disagree with the thread, my point is anything posted by anyone that has no direct knowledge of the true senario is basing everything on speculation and should be treated as such. As I tell my people, if you think you can save the world, then put your money where your mouth is and prove it, if they are right and it works, they get rewards, if not well depends on the senario. Soe is hiring, anyone that believes they can do better should apply for the positions.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;In other words:&amp;nbsp;Instead of being part of the problem, be part of the solution. WOOT!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;Please spare me the platitudes. I have made many constructive criticisms on how Sony could make improvements. From Polling their client base at game start up to reduce wasted man hours on developing code we don't want or need. To making recommendations on simple Q and A.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As an engineer part of my responsibility is to make sure that all systems are identical in all fashions whether hardware, software, or maintenance. This is done to avoid the problems that Sony and maybe even your company runs into. As I have said before, we have had less than 60 seconds of downtime in almost 5 years.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As far as what do I consider a real world server system. Give me a budget of man hours and money. That is what it comes down to. Sony has deep pockets and has no excuse for technical issues. The real cost goes far beyond the game.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;It goes to branding the name Sony. Little Johnny has a bad experience with EQ. He does not care what they are doing behind the scenes. Just that it doesn't work. Little Johnny grows up and goes to buy a technical product. He will now have second thoughts about Sony. So how much did it really cost Sony.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So the bottom line has nothing to do with how you and I banter about technical prowess only that the opportunity cost later down the road is far more expensive than is perceived in quantifiable dollars and cents.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So again why defend a company that clearly is taking shorcuts.&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Problem is that the decision makers seem to be insulated with what is going on at SoE.&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;Bring it to their attention that it may cost them and things will get fixed sooner than later. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I love the arguement about "branding the name Sony" - in todays world of technology that statement can never be adhered to unless you as a consumer decides to move to the country, and forsake any form of technology past the outhouse and outdoor plumbing. Sony as a multi-divisional company you cannot hope to every purchase anything that includes any intergrated circuitry that may go back to sony's coffers in the way of royalities, patents, etc. You cannot watch TV without adding to sony's coffers, you cannot go to a show without adding to their coffers, it is physically impossible to do so, one way or the other they will get a cut of your discretionary income. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Question - define the term systems - is this server level systems or the equipment that end users utilize to access your systems - do you have control over the configuration of the end users systems? Does your 60 seconds of downtime over the last 5 years include the fact that an end users system could not run your program?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
