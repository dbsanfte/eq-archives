    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; These spells have long cast times to ensure they are not used to escape a combat situation that has gone wrong. It keeps them different from evacs. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Yeah, that made sense years ago before the Exodus AA and before the Evacuate spell. As it is, unless you've already used Exodus, I can't see a Wizard keeping any evac spell up. And once Exodus is down, Evacuate is the only spell worth memming because it keeps you in the zone rather than porting you somewhere close. So since there's no real reason to use another spell to escape a bad situation, any casting time longer than that of Evac should be find for a port.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A lot of the port spells take a rather long time to refresh after memorization, and some have just plain crazy casting times. PoK is 18 seconds IIRC. There's no reason for that.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;That said, if some of the core Wizard issues get addressed, they can raise the casting time on our ports to 60 seconds and I doubt any Wizards will complain. :)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Weekly Question? Why bother?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=234201#M234201</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;So its been a month, so supposedly all classes should have had FOUR weekly questions submitted and answered. Of course, most classes haven't even had the first one answered.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So what happened, some management type come up with the idea and then the developers are just ignoring it? Only questions I've even seen answered are the ones they are basically telling the players to suck it up because they aren't doing jack for the proposed issue.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The top 10 quickly became a joke, but this junk started off as a joke. Its really sad.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;So, why was this thing implemented if there wasn't even the intention of trying to make it work?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;While you're looking at the ports and TLs, would you object to making sure that if we can port or evac to a location (maybe not for Plane of Hate and Plane of Sky) we can also do the normal Gate, Group Gate, TL as well.&amp;nbsp; I'm thinking primarily of Skyfire and Emerald Jungle, but there is also South Ro as well which would fit the criteria for needing Gate, Group Gate and TLs.</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;A good number of the weekly questions have come directly to me, since the queries tend to be related to&amp;nbsp;the spell system&amp;nbsp;that I've recently been handed the keys to.&amp;nbsp; I'm not going to have a solid answer for any of them yet, and I'd rather give out a real answer later when I have a firm grasp on the system and what I want to do with it instead of an "I'll look into it" now, but since there's a need for feedback:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Q: Our class has utility spell X and the recast time makes it inconvenient to use.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A: I'm all in favor of changing spells that are inconvenient simply for the sake of being inconvenient, but if it a change would allow you to gain aggro faster, absorb damage faster, cure counters faster, heal damage faster, or kill mobs faster... then there's going to be&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;shift in power, and the end result of the change&amp;nbsp;would need to be considered carefully.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Q: My&amp;nbsp;Prophecy of Ro spell&amp;nbsp;Y leaves something to be desired...&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A: I'd like to evaluate the PoR spells and improve the ones that aren't worth using.&amp;nbsp; I can't give a firm time on when this will be completed.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Q: My class would like to see an&amp;nbsp;upgrade to&amp;nbsp;spell line Z.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A: Thank you for the feedback.&amp;nbsp; I'll keep that in mind when&amp;nbsp;planning&amp;nbsp;spell upgrades for the next time the level cap is increased.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

However, if I want to gate to, say, Greater Faydark - that is 7 sec. And gating to Twiligh Sea is 10.5 sec.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Portals: If I want to evac my group, I can cast Evacuate (9 sec). There is usually no reason to evac to a different zone (there haven't been zones with unsafe succor points in a very long time), but there are evac spells for that too - to Nek, Fay, etc. Now why in the world would I want to portal out of combat instead of evacing? There is a very, very, very small chance of leaving party members behind on evac but nobody would ever portal instead of evac really - just for the reason of leaving the zone. And yet portal spells have casting times from 16 to 24 sec.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Translocate: If I were to TL somebody else out of combat (so that the mob that's killing them would kill me instead??), there is the basic Translocate spell (8 sec). TL them to Nexus instead of the bind point is 10 sec. But TL to PoK (and some other places) is 15 sec. Why? What possible purpose other than just being inconvenient can that serve?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;None of those spells with extra long casting times are used to escape combat. They are used quite as intended - to transport groups and raids to and from perfectly safe places around the world. And that's where players' time is simply wasted for no real reason.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;And this is different than the old system how?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Any Dev worth asking a question to already post here once a week and they're generally answering someones question. Few questions are unique enough to require a special correspondent to pass them along. Hell, I've never played a wizard but I can list thier most frequent questions as well as anyone who spends 10 minutes a day on this forum.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Correspondent ask Kyth, she asks a Dev, Dev answers Kyth, Kyth asnwers Correspondent. (last time we communicated like this it was called the telegraph) And when the correspondent finally post it on the forums&amp;nbsp; the first reply is always "Can we get a dev to confirm this?"&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Parsis on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-05-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;09:31 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;The other thing to keep in mind is that weekly question does NOT necessarily mean, imply, or infer "weekly answer".&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Sometimes we'll get an answer, and sometimes we won't.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Most questions that have shown up have been Spell, AA, or Item related... or just too general to get an appropriate answer.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In some of these cases, our answer will sometimes be delayed sometimes even indefinitely.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; One of the issues that arises is when expectations are that every class will have the answer to their question every week... the same basic thing happenned with the top 10 lists.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;We'll continue to ask questions, but we will not always get answers, and as long as folks understand that, then they'll be much less prone to unreasonable disappointment.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;A weekly question won't necessarily mean a weekly answer.&lt;br&gt;That is considered communication? Why ask questions if no answer is to be expected? We are to ask rhetorical questions of the devs?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I could understand they might need time to answer questions if we quizzed them on topics they might not know about but I'm sure most questions would be confined to EQ, at least for the first few months. Are we to believe that they don't have any plan for CHeal (cleric question) or that they couldn't be bothered supplying an answer? Prathun posts about needing to look into things, kk he is new to his post but are all the devs new to their posts too? Surely there is a plan or a direction in place for the game? Why is there a problem getting answers?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remember Halfling Hodgepodge Extreme - Q&amp;amp;A?&lt;br&gt;Q&amp;amp;A- &lt;a target="_blank" href="message?board.id=Veterans&amp;amp;message.id=115734"&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;amp;message.id=115734&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discussion thread- &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;amp;message.id=110789"&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;amp;message.id=110789&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Player discussion thread opened before Kyths one- &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;amp;message.id=111161"&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;amp;message.id=111161&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was very limited in what players could ask, when they could ask and how they could ask and what devs would answer and when they would answer and how they would answer and eventually it just died due to lack of dev input. The problem there wasn't the players.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just to remind people how the Hodgepodge started........&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Mikar wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;"I forgot to mention that the first edition of Halfling Hodgepodge Extreme is scheduled to be up on EQLive on Friday, September 23rd.", Kytn&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Pardon me for asking this - but why wont there be a set of&amp;nbsp;answers this month?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;By not answering a single question for more than &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;5 weeks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; this entire things gets an air of stalling to it - rather than&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;fresh air&amp;nbsp;from wanting to communicate with us I hope its meant to give.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So, I humbly ask that you put to your bosses that if this is meant as anything but a charade and&amp;nbsp;I assume it is meant as more then answering questions should not wait 5 weeks. Rather it should happen soon&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- and without the use of the dreaded "just wait and see what we have in the coming expansion" kind of answers. Disclose some real info or dont bother, please.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am looking forward to seeing what happens. My jaded side is screaming no hard questions will be answered in real detail or any time soon - but my optimistic side is trying to convince me you wouldnt try to pull a fast one on us. Before the 5 week part my optimistic side still had a chance - but now I fear my jaded side took a huge lead. Please put my jadeness to shame by getting us some honest straightforward answers to a good deal of the questions asked - much sooner than in 5 weeks from now.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Mikar on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;08-16-2005&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;06:43 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Maebe on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-06-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;10:41 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;There isn't much to say. Every correspondent has their own policy about forwarding answers, but I think generally they do it, so count them and you can figure out how successful we are.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;It is unfortunate timing that new devs are in charge of spells and AAs, and therefore can't really answer questions, but there isn't much we can do about it other than waiting.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm good at waiting. :)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;This is hilarious....&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Do you actually expect the 'powers that be' at SoE to post here? Take a look at what happens when even a small comment makes it out of the dev team.&amp;nbsp; Tremendous speculations on top of unrealistic expectations confounded by unreal attitudes and know-it-all board&amp;nbsp;'experts' who will flame anything that they didn't think of 1st.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Would YOU post anything into such an environment, if it meant placing your job on the line?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Every tiny comment made by SoE is exaggerated and twisted out of context in a matter of minutes. Even the slightest misconception can generate pages of half-baked nonsense that SoE has to host on thier servers. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Invariably someone will take offense and quit the game. That costs SoE revenue. (stil waiting for SoE to post?)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I'm willing to bet that even the slightest flaw here generates thousands of CS calls....calls that cost SoE money. (and we all know that SoE is about the money 1st, game 2nd)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So, No. There are no relevent posts here from SoE. I no longer expect them to post. I find myself content if SoE just keeps breathing regularly. In a way I'm gratefull for this ridiculous progression server, they have left the regular servers alone for a while now. That's a relief in many ways.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Was there any response from a community relations rep in the two or so working days this thread was open? How about a dev? Oh a class correspondant?&lt;br&gt;Hmm maybe a question was answered in the past week or since this thread started?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is another dead communication idea. One liners and talk of the flavour of the day (progression server) are all you will ever get.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They know they aren't interested in talking about EQ with us. We know that they aren't interested in talking about EQ with us. There is no need for the pretence of communication.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
