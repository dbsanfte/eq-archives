    <description>I play an evil character in a high end raiding guild.  To begin the quest for the AA series from this, we need 5 missions from our own faction to begin.  However, because our guild is mainly good chars,  we will be doing good raids...sooooo the evils have to get good faction before they can commence AA.  This takes 30 missions/taks while for goods it is 5.  PLUS...what a kicker...if youEVER help the other side you LOSE THE AA!!  What's wrong with this picture?  Anyone else see this expansion as biased and discriminatory?  Has caused a TON of trouble in our guild, and I imagine it will in others too unless there is some way of trading faction here.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I find it funny all this talk about my guild is on this faction and I'm on that faction.&amp;nbsp; correct me if I'm wrong but isnt one of the purposes of guilds for for poeple on a like mind to work on things (raids, progression, etc.) together, that being said a guild as a whole should pick a faction and everyone in the guild should work that faction none of this part of the guild on one faction part on the other.&amp;nbsp; there faction problem solved.&amp;nbsp; ooops guess that makes sense&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;That's the whole point. You don't have to do that with DoN. The pieces the drop on raids can be used for good or evil. The only thing different is the solo tasks and the group missions. And even then you can have mixed factions helping each other and not take faction hits. Back in the Velious days&amp;nbsp;doing the guild faction thing is&amp;nbsp;what you had to do. I find the DoN system much more flexible in letting people choose whichever faction they want to roleplay.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;There really is no faction problem in DoN. Other than evil starting lower in the evil camp than goodies on the other side. Or so I've heard...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hope that makes sense!&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;P&gt;It all balances out in the end, simply because only people of extreme endurance can stand up to the lore of the good side.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;"&lt;EM&gt;Explain to me how the Evil and Good factions MATTER one bit? Both sides get EXACTLY the same rewards, exactly the same items on the merchant, and essentially do exactly the same missions in exactly the same zones, except the DR missions and tasks are about 500% harder compared to the Keepers(yes I have done both)"&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have seen nothing and heard nothing from friends doing DR missions to indicate this statement is at all true.&amp;nbsp; DR missions and tasks are much harder?&amp;nbsp; They are the same zones.&amp;nbsp; They are almost identical.&amp;nbsp; You may have had a bad experience in a couple missions, but I highly doubt they're signficantly different in difficulty.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The sameness is content is the biggest problem with the opposing factions.&amp;nbsp; Like if I go talk to the task givers at the wayfarer camp, i can get tasks to boost one side or the other's faction.&amp;nbsp; Those tasks are identifical.&amp;nbsp; From a storyline perspective, that makes no sense.&amp;nbsp; e.g. both the keepers and the DR want me to kill 20 mobs in stillmoon?&amp;nbsp; why?&amp;nbsp; Shouldn't they have different tasks with opposing goals?&amp;nbsp; Oh, but that would require actually developing 2 sets of tasks.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>A question here, as a guy with an evil character who groups with goodies... they will always want to do good missions.  Is there an NPC I can exchange the radiant crystals for ebon crystals with (once they are droppable), or do I have to find a PC who actually wants these darn ebon(?) crystals ?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Obvously I will lose out on building evil faction as well.</description>

      <description>Update since last patch.  Trying to trade radiant crystals for ebon crystals for my necromancer.  600 radiant crystals on bazaar and 0 ebon crystals ... great.  Do the devs know the split between groups doing evil and good missions ?  Is anyone doing the evil ones ?</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;While being KoS, none of the NPC of either camp will attack you, only the guards ( who are outside the camp, and don't see invisi ), the merchant will even sell to you...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>"It would be nice if there was a fairly easy quest to be able to switch factions.  For example, do some easy quest that takes maybe an hour.  And say you pick dark reign you want faction with.  Factions are reset to apprehensive to dark reign and glare to the other side."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ill second that one. Should be more involved then the curent solo tasks for sure, but less involved then doing 100 missions. Tho id say it should take more then an hour, atleast several hours.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;"Yes giving a storyline and maintaining game integrity has always been a bane of SOE and Verant.&amp;nbsp; Frags you picked your side when you created your character. took ya all of two minutes."&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>"Sounds like what you are asking for would be a spoiler - no SOE rep is going to post an answer to such a question. A Player will have to find out and report the answer."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You're joking right? The answer i already got was far more of a 'spoiler' tho i dont consider any of the questions i have asked in this thread 'spoilers'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Had i asked what the rewards for the progression are, thats a spoiler.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Had i asked to lay out what was required to do the progerssion for a side, thats a spoiler.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asking if the flag for a turn in is unique to one side or the othes is not a spoiler its just a mechanics question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asking if you finish the progression(not how you finish, but IF you finish it) what happens if you kill your faction, i guess you could consider that a spoiler. But come on. we already know you lose the abilities, they said that right off the back, it would just be nice to know if you get hem back for factioning back up or if you have to start over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its relevant to my personal situation. Guild started from the start to do evil only. I started on the good path and tried to work in faction hits, but with roughly 95% doing evil i didnt wanna rob 5 peopel in the group of faction just for myself. Too many unknowns and not wanting to get left behidn i switched factions, was at amiable with NK and scowels with DR, i switched and am currently just shy of kindly DR and very scowels NK. Currently on the 3rd stage of progression. At this time i plan to finish the DR progression.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After thats done....IF i can switch and NOT have to do the raids over i will strongly consider switching. I dont mind doing the single person progression or the group progression for the other side, but i do NOT want to do the raids over. To ask my guild to do them over for me would be askign too much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Max scowels = -2000 faction, missions or tasks are 20 factions per. Simple math 100 missions or tasks to get back to indifferent(0) if you decide to switch after completing the other side. Add on another 58 missions to get back up to ally(1150). Thats 158 missions to switch faction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without an answer to that question, i would have to do atleast 105 missions(amirable from max scowels) to find out if i didnt need to do the first raid over. Then assuming i did and wanted to switch back, i would again have to do another 100 missions to get back up to indifferent on the other side to see if i got back my AA without having to do the progression over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thats too many missions to ask someoen to just take a leap of faith on. It really needs an answer. I dont see anything 'spoiler' about it. Just like the raid progression needed an answer and we got one(tho i wish it had come afew days earlier).</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;k does noone uinderstad these are two armies AT WAR WITH EACH OTHER.. this is the easiest faction in the game get a grip go amiable with giants and see how long it takes ya to get miable with vos.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Make a tier tier dal see how long it takes ya to get faction with&amp;nbsp; in&amp;nbsp; the high elf city. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Missions are not a waste of time their sole purpose is not Faction. You get rewards. you accrue points and gems you can use to get some nice items. You get experience doing the missions. and nice drops. You dont want to do&amp;nbsp; missions or task to rebuld faction then join raids and turn in your tokens at the wayfarer camps. Thats what they there for. to build faction if ya cant get into either camp.&amp;nbsp; You dont want to do either camp? fne then just go into the zones and go for some mindless purposeless slaughter.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;These camps give YOUR CHARACTER reasons to go into these lands They give YOUR character motivtions and things to look out for objectives and such to accomplish.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If you feel no need to play a CHARACTER then skip the whole business altogether. The Dragons are the evil as well as the muramites. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Bottom line imay need to do thirty missions to get the aa for a particular faction but i can do any of the shared missions and turn in my tokens if i choose while still not being able to set foot in their camp/ Thats certainly something none of us have been able to do before and it is a luxury to be able to do so without the mindless&amp;nbsp; faction killing of green of&amp;nbsp; days past. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;instead of moaning how your immediately kos to one faction and have to be able to work your way up in faction . You should be glad there is a way your character can betray its race and deity&amp;nbsp; and serve the other side&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I like the idea of the opposing factions and the related progressive storyline.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think it's a wise decision that the rewards are equal, or at least equivalent. If they weren't, people would complain incessantly.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I don't think that the current faction setup is prohibitive or extraordinarily annoying. As has been mentioned, a Cazic Thule following SK friend of mine is currently at the same stage as me in Norrath's Keepers progress. He was caught up a week into the expansion. Even if he plays more than you... what will it take, a month to be in a position to reap all of the benefits of alliance with a faction, while earning reasonably good experience, tokens for reasonably good loot, and having fun? That's a lot more fun than grinding in Kael for indeteriminate amounts of time, or watching people slaughter innumerable helpless Coldain. And really, that's the best comparison I can make for faction, beucase it's the last time faction mattered for crap as far as I can tell. Personally, I thought the faction setup in Qeynos was the best, but that model has long since been abandoned; since Velious, the closest things to faction we've had have been Traders of the Haven (running inane delivery tasks) and Dranik Loyalists (endless grinding!). I prefer this setup. And I think that in the time spent expressing discontent over it on the boards, you probably could have gotten a Stillmoon Population Control Task, done a Stillmoon group mission, and - if you pick the right mission - gotten a faction hit from a kill in there, as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We may have grown spoiled from having faction not matter at all in PoP, LoY, LDoN, and only be required for specific tasks in GoD and OoW. With DoN, it matters again. You can take advantage of the options available to work with that, or you can complain that, because of your chosen path in EQ,&amp;nbsp;you have to work at it a little more than some of your friends. I know which seems like more fun to me.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;OK, I"ve read the whole thread and everything else I can find. Here's what I've gathered:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Gemdiver wrote a guide to DoN, link posted on this site that stated that you can use the wayfarer camp to exchange one token for the other and that if you get stuck with tokens of the wrong faction you can take them to the twins Youra and Limann who will gladly exchange them.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Could Gemdiver have been wrong? Of course. Would faction "matter" if he were correct? Not so much. However, if you really can't exchange the tokens what's the point of the twins? Why would their canned responses say that they are working both sides of the war?&amp;nbsp;How are they working both sides if they each only work for one? Why should they even be there if you can turn in tokens in the very camp where they are earned? Since there's been no official statement from devs saying explicitly "no you can't exchange tokens" this all leaves me terribly curious. So I guess what I'm really asking here of all of you non devs is...are you sure? Could it be we just don't know how yet or its broken? Of the devs I'm asking...can&amp;nbsp;I please get an explicit answer here?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

I have actually tried every other NPC in the wayfarer camp and the evil camp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All the twins do, is that they allow you to turn in tokens while still KoS to the mission giving faction. But I am not sure if you can't invis up to those and just turn it in anyways. The merchant shows you his wares even when still KoS, not tried actually buying something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Incase this is not as intended, meaning the twins should actually take tokens for oposite faction, I would like to know asap. Currently trashing my evil faction on the assumption that they are working as intended.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;If they've figured out how to prevent duping, I wish SOE would go ahead and&amp;nbsp;release a small patch to fix crystals (make them tradable as they were intended to be). The longer crystals remain&amp;nbsp;no-drop, the more people give up their desired faction and go with the opposite, simply because most of their friends/guildmates are on that faction and they're accumulating crystals they cannot use. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For example, the Dark faction folks in my guild are much more avid mission-goers; they're doing 4-5 times the number of missions as the folks on&amp;nbsp;Keeper faction, so most of the groups available to me are doing Dark missions, hence most of the crystals I'm&amp;nbsp;earning are Ebon. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'd already have enough to buy&amp;nbsp;an augment I *really* want, but those crystals are useless to me because I cannot trade them for Radiants. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;This faction/crystal system was designed in such a way that players shouldn't feel like they're being separated from friends and guildies because of faction.... but with the crystals not being tradable, that&amp;nbsp;design consideration&amp;nbsp;is largely wasted.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;People don't want to earn savings bonds and post-dated gift certificates they can't use for weeks. They want to earn crystals that they can &lt;U&gt;spend&lt;/U&gt;. So most will only do missions from their own faction -- and the separation that SOE devs went out of their way to avoid, is happening anyway.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Regards,&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
