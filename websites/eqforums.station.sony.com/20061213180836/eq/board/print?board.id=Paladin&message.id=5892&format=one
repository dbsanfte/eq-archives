<P>Are you sure you are doing the even correctly?&nbsp; There are like four or five waves of adds that you have to kill from the East, West, and I think South gravestones.&nbsp; Once they are all dead, Mujaki becomes targetable and you can kill him to get the shade to spawn.&nbsp; If you don't kill the adds fast enough, they reach his platform and become untargetable.&nbsp; The key is to kill them before they make it that far.</P>

<P>I agree with Royr, it sounds like you're doing it incorrectly.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no "single-pulling" involved in this.&nbsp;&nbsp; You have 3 gravestones around the stage area.&nbsp; You position 3 groups, 1 near each gravestone, and you kill everything that spawns so they don't reach the stage.&nbsp; Eventually, Mujaki becomes targetable, and he is standing there on the stage alone at this point.&nbsp; You run and kill him, then the 2nd one spawns in the same spot.</P>
<P>You can have up to 4 groups for this event.</P>
