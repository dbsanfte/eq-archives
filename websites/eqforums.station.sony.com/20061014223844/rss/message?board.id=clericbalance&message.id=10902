      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I should have added fears to that type of spell, for which they are as well since it incites panic into the targets mind (albeit nulled on 66+ and fear immune types but it is there) so in my opinion if one can incite fear, with practice, one can also imbue a zealous conviction (to kill). We are mostly defensive and passive in nature, but with the presence of fears and being able to harness godly wrath (nukes and ward, dots to an extent) we can be of the flipside of the coin and dabble with offensive measures also, but as it stands we always will have around 5:1 in beneficial to detrimental spells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would be my justification at least for that type at least, as zeal is excessive fervor to do something or accomplish some end and since clerics are masters of the faith, this could be a new line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Lluianae on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;03-09-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;02:36 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Things i would like to see:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1: Right clickable spell buff descriptions, Do i have dependable invis or not? I cant tell. What does this buff do? I cant tell.&lt;br&gt;2: A new player controlled Undead race added that are weak against cleric's and pally's (our undead spells would work on them), maybe then we will see some of us in the PVP top 100.&lt;br&gt;3: Un-dispellable (or hard to dispell) AA buffs and/or vet AA's .&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I would like to see some way of dealing with fleeing mobs when soloing added to the list. Yes I know they flee from all characters, but nobody suffers from it as much as a cleric. Our dps vanishes, and we can't snare. The best we can do is root, and even if that lands it gets broken by practically everything. Adding another mob to stop them running isnt really an option in many zones, especially for younger clerics.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think this is a reasonable request because the developers clearly intend our best solo ability to rely on being hit, when they are running and not hitting solo ability goes out of the window. I'd like to see ideally, the previously discussed spell to stop mobs fleeing, perhaps make it a buff that you cast on yourself, and procs when a mob hits you, but only lasts for 10 seconds or so, to limit its group usefulness. You could even add this proc to our current ward of retribution spell. I dont think that is too much to ask personally. Would save a lot of irritation. Nothing is worse than spending 3-5 minutes grinding a mob down, only for it to run away and bring all it's friends forcing you to die/gate.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Hmm, there are Snare potions out there now that alchemists can make. Much as I loathe to add yet another potion for us to buy, I wonder if an item or potion could be made with that warrior effect on it. Basically you throw it at the mob and it angers the mob such that it stops running and continues attacking you for a period of time?</description>

      <description>Clerics have had spells that are mental manipulators since quite early on (lull/paci, 1 mem blur), I could see a spell that lore wise would infuse such zeal into the mind of the mob, that they will continue to attack not a care in the world however it would have a chance to work and not a certainty, just like the warrior skill is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

My only real complaint is that the 15 second cast time on the mask still seems a little high, i really hate when players can insta invis themselfs and be on the move while i gotta wait.......................&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;aren't we due for an update on our Top 10 list? Last I heard it was on the first friday of every month, or every other month.&amp;nbsp; Last update was 1/11/06.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Religion is a cleric issue we share with priests, much like pet is a mage issue they share with pet classes. It makes sense for the mage correspondent to include pet upgrades in his top 10 list, even if there are other pet users. So I feel it's perfectly normal to have this new issue in the list.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;"Religion" is an issue the entire game has, Not just priest, One class gets something "religion" wise the rest will want, Again, its an issue of the entire game in a sense of lacking. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;To say its to improve the classe(s) on a religion sense, doesn't make sense considering every spell we cast is a "blessing" so to speak. If you mean "diety" inclined spells, well then the rest of the world of norath should get something as well. melee/pet/whatever. So it makes more sense to say, SOE should look into this as a game enhancement that will support all classes. Still to me that request on the list makes absolutely no sense.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The new item comes from a poll that was done a few month ago on 'that other' site. :)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I typically take the 3 best votes from a poll and add them as issues are removed from the list.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Or the polls be held here, Seems some issue that was brought up months ago, and debated over, and most likely even glorified now comes into place of the empty spot, inspite the fact that other issues may have come about in that time. Especially since a whole new expansion came out.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;And it has been said by quite a few "active" clerics on these forums, that they do NOT frequent those other sites.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>But also theres a  lot of clerics that read those boards that don't come here.  I'm one of many that read eqclerics religiously and just check out this place every couple weeks.  Why should this be the definitive site? Eqclerics was around many years before this even came into existence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
