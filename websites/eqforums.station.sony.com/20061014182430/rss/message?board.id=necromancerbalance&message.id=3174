&lt;P&gt;/shrug&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp; If its less than 1% of necro population affected then it doesnt bother me. However, since its less that 1% who have that robe why bother nerf it. Just adjust the robe with a patch for all those who are going to get it,not have it.. Sort of like&amp;nbsp; that invis item(sorry have a brain fart right now), was .1 cast time,now its 5 seconds.....Just say gratz them for having it,and move on...&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I would have to ask, do all Class Correspondants get together b4 they talk to dev's and actually discuss the issues. Or do they not communicate with eachother and discuss &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;does this item/spell or whatever really need to be put to devs for the 'NERF BAT' ???? I would hope so..I would hope our class correspondant speak up more against this kindof crap. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;In honesty I want us to nerf mage/BL pets, think they are getting way overpowered also. Nerf rangers endless quiver,if I can run out of mana,they should go back to running out of arrows.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In all seriousness, Weve asked for things to improve our class,but it seems it takes longer to fix than for SOE to nerf, go figure. I know theres balancing and figuring out spell/aa stuff,but crap throw us something. If u can take time to revamp a zone(s),u can take time to revamp our pets. As someone &amp;nbsp;said our pets arent priority,but I dont think revamping zones just for cosmetics is priority neither,as it does not improve gameplay nor zone traffic..&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anywho, seems like a mute point arguing or asking, just seems it gets nerfed eventually(goes for all classes).&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Sorry its just BS that this item was nerfed.&amp;nbsp; It wasn't as overpowering as other classes and devs would have some people believe.&amp;nbsp; This change is made when so many things in the new expansion remain broke, and long after a balance was found in oow- an expansion many of the top teired guilds have moved away from or have severely limited their farming of.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If the best arguement SOE can muster is that this was nerfed because everyone elses BP's were sucky, then when will the nerfing end?&amp;nbsp; What class is safe from the fury of their nerfbat?&amp;nbsp; WE SHOULDN'T BE NERFING TWO YEAR OLD CONTENT ITS BAD BUSINESS.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In case anyone is curious about the q and a for this week and the answer I got here it is.&amp;nbsp; Its nerfed intentionally and they don't care to change it back.&amp;nbsp; Welcome back to "the vision" days of old necromancers.&amp;nbsp; Its up to all of us to tell SOE this just is NOT cool.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

First of all, it was far far more powerful than other tier 2 bp.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
It was effectively a 10% dps increase.&amp;nbsp; The wiz clicky was.. maybe&#xD;
1% dps increase if you're being generous.&amp;nbsp; The cleric clicky was&#xD;
nearly useless for raid content.&amp;nbsp; The mage click is a 2-3% dps&#xD;
increase, on fights where they can use pets.&amp;nbsp; The ranger click is&#xD;
a 2 dps increase (not 2%, 2 actual dps).&amp;nbsp; You still get a 6% dps&#xD;
increase from your bp, which makes it at least twice as powerful as any&#xD;
other bp.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Secondly, Rashere made a logical reply to your question.&amp;nbsp; I don't see the problem with it.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
And I think I might have an idea as to why it took so long for this&#xD;
nerf to happen... Most all you know that necros tend to be quiet about&#xD;
the dps their class does.&amp;nbsp; I don't blame you, and I won't post any&#xD;
numbers at the request of my necros, but you have to realize that when&#xD;
you try and be secretive about such things, it might end up causing&#xD;
late nerfs.&amp;nbsp; If the devs had been aware at how overpowered your bp&#xD;
was a year ago, I'm sure they would have taken care of it then.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
Just be glad you got such a powerful item for so long.&amp;nbsp; You're&#xD;
still the top dps in most situations, so I'd enjoy that while it lasts&#xD;
as well.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Oh, and **HALFLING** is this "law of equivalency" that you speak of?&amp;nbsp; This&#xD;
isn't a contained system where all the energy and mass must remain&#xD;
constant.&amp;nbsp; There isn't some rule that if the devs take something,&#xD;
they must give something in return and vice versa.&amp;nbsp; Just because&#xD;
you think something is true, doesn't make it so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Orruar on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-15-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;09:52 AM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>lol, quit complaining about your class. You and everyone else knows what you can do, one clicky isn't class-breaking, infact, it's still probably the most powerful click for any class from omens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you feel you deserve more DPS, I think it's time you smelt the roses and looked right in front of you. Or stop mana pumping so much and actually parse yourself, I know my gimpy little necro twink with only half his spells is doing some pretty hot sustained DPS on raid fights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I say necros can have the same clicky that magicians have if they think ours is so much better.&amp;nbsp; It's 18 sec for Tier 1, 30 sec for Tier 2, and the effect is 50%&amp;nbsp;melee modifer&amp;nbsp;to our PET's DPS (and reduces damage taken by pet).</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Heh..I liked the direction DODH took necromancy.&amp;nbsp; I'm just sad it wasn't continued in PoR.&amp;nbsp; The robe nerf, is *a bit late* IMO.&amp;nbsp; I mean, if you're going to change an item to that degree it should be done&amp;nbsp; in&amp;nbsp;sooner then 2 years after the item was in the game.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I don't know if this is part of a "retuning" for my class, or simply just a "fix" to one item that was deemed to powerfull(I'd like some clarity on this as well, from a dev..not more whining from players).&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;DPS is the only central role most&amp;nbsp;necromancers play on raids, we&amp;nbsp;do mindflay consistently..but twitching isn't needed anymore(in most cases)&amp;nbsp;with good raid leadership and some forethought.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It just seems like a mixed message, they gave us some very good DPS centric upgrades in DODH..next to nothing in PoR and then take away half of the duraction of an effect on a very rare or atleast hard to attain item..&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Hey, at least your tier 2 bp is still the best out there.. Your closest&#xD;
cousins, the wizards, get an essentially useless click.&amp;nbsp; The only&#xD;
fights where it could plausibly increase their dps at all is on fights&#xD;
under 3 minutes (and even then, the dps increase is marginal at best),&#xD;
which are mostly trivial by nature anyway.&amp;nbsp; Sure, they should have&#xD;
done this about 18 months ago, but Sony isn't known for their lightning&#xD;
quick reflexes to such things.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Well, this ends any effective burn that necros had.&amp;nbsp; It took me almost a year to get this item only to have it nerfed to **HALFLING**.&amp;nbsp; Sony has made EQ a P.O.S. game and its no wonder that its dying.&amp;nbsp; Nothing like **HALFLING**ing everyone over time and time again and expect them to take it and say "thankyou sir may I have another?" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EQ has totally ruined necromancers in the last 2 years.&amp;nbsp; It has really gone down hill since LDON came out.&amp;nbsp; More noticably so in the last 2 expansions.&amp;nbsp; Its almost as if they are tired of the necromancer class and doing everything in thier power to make them all quit.&amp;nbsp; Well, in my guild, over the last yearand a half we went from 13 active necromancer to just me.&amp;nbsp; Well, I quit last week&amp;nbsp; so there are no more active necromancers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon you wont have to make necromancer specific armor or spells.&amp;nbsp; Then its time to start on the mages and the enchanters.&amp;nbsp; Won't take long for the enchanters, you are almost done with them as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Quote&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Ahhh!!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I see where he got the idea that Necro's were nerfed.&amp;nbsp; Check out this line from&amp;nbsp;the patch notes.&amp;nbsp; I just spotted it myself:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;*** Miscellaneous ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- We've now upgraded to DirectX 9.0c!&lt;BR&gt;- Many pathing issues have been resolved. Monsters rejoice!&lt;BR&gt;- The Universal Chat system will replace the old Channel Server for all channel operations. All player-owned channels will be moved over automatically and using channels in the new system is the same as before, so you should not notice any difference. One of the primary benefits of this change is that channels now support cross-server and cross-game functionality. EQIM will no longer work with this change however we do intend to remedy this situation if possible in the future.&lt;BR&gt;- Luclin character models are now available to everyone, whether they own Shadows of Luclin or not.&lt;BR&gt;- Increased the amount of experience you gain toward your shroud progression when you kill an NPC as a shroud. In addition, you will now gain more experience toward your evolving item when you are in a group, similar to how normal experience works. This does not affect the evolving tradeskill trophies, which don't gain experience from killing creatures.&lt;BR&gt;- Fixed a number of rendering anomalies that could occur throughout the game.&lt;BR&gt;- Targeting corpses should now be much easier and much less confusing.&lt;BR&gt;- Item links can now be sent across Universal Chat channels!&lt;BR&gt;- Ogre females using voice emotes for Agree and Disagree will now play the proper voices.&lt;BR&gt;- Player and NPC names should now be rendering correctly at all times when they are overlapping.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0000&gt;- Necromancers have been nerfed to uselessness.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now granted, it is a bit hazy, a bit superfluous, a bit ambiguous, but that may be what the OP is talking about&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;LMAO, i was drinking milk and now its dripping from my nose, thanks very much, you owe me a new monitor!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Mages nuke, necros dot, that is why ours went for a longer&#xD;
duration.&amp;nbsp; Some people seem unable to grasp the concept of Damage&#xD;
Over Time, this being the main factor distinguishing necros from our&#xD;
less patient caster bretheren and sisters.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
WTG devs on nerfing something 2 years after the item entered the&#xD;
game.&amp;nbsp; That's pathetic.&amp;nbsp; If it needed to be adjusted it&#xD;
should have been done then, not now, after some dev with nothing better&#xD;
to do (like say...fix necros in spectral form not being able to sit on&#xD;
a horse, wizard dps in general, endurance regen for melees......) nit&#xD;
picked his or her way into nerfing a highly deirable item into a&#xD;
slightly less desirable one.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Does the word PRIORITISE mean anything to you people?&amp;nbsp; I mean you&#xD;
are the people who brought us the deadly mos snake kick nerf while&#xD;
leaving the issue of Aura of Death unaddressed.&amp;nbsp; I salute you on&#xD;
your ability to see the trees and not the forest!&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>*hands the necros a book called "gimp SK anguish BPs and you"*&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
even after the nerf, its still 50000x better than what SKs get. a 24&#xD;
second 15% leechcurse. call me when you get something comparable. =)&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Sounds like it needed a nerf and anyone whining about it should get&#xD;
over it. Necro's already have a huge advantage over many classes.&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Alright, The rogue correspondant was one of the more vocal posters in the Nerf Nerco thread a few months back, so he's the one I called out. Personally dont think Dalnoth is going to lose any sleep over it, but if so sorry Dal.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Big huge long thread about nerfing necros, then the next patch, it happens. Yeah a small nerf is still a nerf reguardless of what the know it alls of the Vet board say. Hell whining worked well in the Nerf thread, perhaps if I'd have joined in there, in defense of my class, no nerf would have ever happened. Ok Ok now that is Naieve of me.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Not going to bother responding invidivually to the mass flaming my Original post received, kinda pointless, much like posting anything in the Vet board. Any concessions I make will be twisted then flamed and twisted some more before being reflamed.&amp;nbsp;That is why i tend to keep my posting here minimal at best.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Really just wanted to post my displeasure over the sudden and unexpected nerfing of the Necro class item from OoW. Perhaps I went about it to agressively (theres my concession flame away, idk), but whining seems to get the most responses, hell it worked for others, thought Id give it a go too ;)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Druids arent dps .. but almost 400 days played on one .. and 10 days played on the other .. you might think the druid with 2 times the mana pool and 3 times the hp would be close ... he isnt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
