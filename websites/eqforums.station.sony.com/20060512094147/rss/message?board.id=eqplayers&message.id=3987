That can only be done once every 24 hours.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;If I remember correctly it updates every 24 hours, you can manually update it but I don't remember the command right now&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I recall, you can manually type in the command /eqplayersupdate, but this command is only available once every 24 hours, so you would use it just before signing out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also...  if you are in EQ and look at the options, there is an option there to automatically update EQ Players.   I do believe that it is turned on by default.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone actually uses EQPlayers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;My question is how can I get it to give me Accurate info about myself?  It has yet to give me full 100% accurate info like what spells i have, what aa i have, even the equipment i'm using.  Granted im not expecting it to show i have a new ring an hour after i put it on, i know that will take time to replicate.  but things like my robe that has sadly not been upgraded in at least a year is still not there.  spells i've had for a long time are still being reported as missing.  It's also telling me i have aa and leadership aa that i dont have and missing ones that i do!  What do i have to do to get accurate info?  Is that asking alot?  I am paying extra for this.  Is there some trick i need to know?  Do i have to manually update eqplayers from within game everyday or there some other trick to get it working? &lt;/div&gt;</description>

I just checked myself on EQPlayers and it is incredibly innaccurate. I know I told it to update on Sunday and it still shows gear I haven't had in months, not to mention empty slots. Good thing I don't pay Sony extra for this.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;eqplayers is horrible.I had to go in and switch my character to hide because its not listing my AAs correctly.I know I have 2 more AAs then is listed and its keeping me from having the top spot for necs on my server.The more peeps reach the limit the more I fall behind when i should be one AA over the cap.</description>
