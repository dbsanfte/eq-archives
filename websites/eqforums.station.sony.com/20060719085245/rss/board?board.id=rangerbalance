      <title>New expansion upgrades? Stats to Float?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=rangerbalance&amp;message.id=21030#M21030</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;My hope for upgrades is the ability of the CAPS to be floated. It hurts to be so far over the cap the more gear is a waste of time and effort. To be acquiring a new neck slot for 10 hps more or an alternate focus effect due to maxing out a different one is inane.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I personally have AC &amp;gt;2500 and the soft cap maybe what 1900? &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have not even bought many of the stat aaxp because I have maxxed them with gear and cant go past 365 in most of the fields.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Resists are max and more gear does not help.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Float the caps to the ability of the charater. Artificially capping them makes those that have not gotten better equal to those that have worked hard to Max stats and shrug at gear or aaxp because it would make no difference.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;AAXP&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Gah, too many reason to laugh at SONY's "gifts" to even worry what might be envisioned. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Spells.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I see used bones for Hybrids again.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;DISC:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Unlock them and reduce the timers. WS and TS are not overpowered just underutilized.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Trueshot Longbow and Planing Tool?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=rangerbalance&amp;message.id=21018#M21018</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;The first part of this post is just a ramble about WHY I thought of the question, the second part is the actual question (skip first part if you want):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So I was looking around at eqtraders.com and I was looking up random recipes (yeah ... I am pretty bored at work).&amp;nbsp; I was looking at some fletching recipes and saw they used planing tools and they returned planing tool on failure or success (as I already knew).&amp;nbsp; I was suddenly thinking about the ranger I just started on The Sleeper.&amp;nbsp; I thought Trueshot Longbow used a planing tool so I was curious to look it up.&amp;nbsp; Sure enough it did, but it did not list the recipe as returning a planing tool (neither on success or failure).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;So my question:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does Trueshot Longbow recipe return the planning tool on failure and/or success?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Just wondering, are any of our spells, AA's, disc etc. ideas that we suggested for class improvments (e.g. class re-envisionment ideas) being used in serpent's spine?&amp;nbsp; Not looking for a spoiler, but maybe a hint... a hint like: yes, they completely ignored the players =).&#xD;

      <title>Tradeskill suggestions</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=rangerbalance&amp;message.id=21006#M21006</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I know SoE doesn't like rangers as a range class, but I was thinking it would be cool if...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Forrageable tradeskill items could be added throughout the game. Endless Quiver makes this pointless at higher levels, but if added to older zones for lowere levels it would be great.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Lets say a ranger was XP'ing in the OverThere. The ranger could forrage twigs, sheet rock and feathers. A skilled fletchers could then used a grinder to turn the sheet rock into crafted arrow heads, the twigs into shafts and etc. Then combine these parts to make arrows. Harder zones could yeild better arrows, and different tools could make better arrows too.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I for one made my ranger to be a range class. I am almost to the point of having endless quiver now and I have a tolans bracer, but I remember running to the OT with hundreds of arrows so I could play with a bow. I think being able to forrage componets and making arrows would be fun and a great aspect to the lower end of the ranger class.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I was taking a look at the new dev's post about stats and I notice something that never occurred to me.&amp;nbsp; Mana was rated as very high on pretty much everyones but my list.&amp;nbsp; Right now at the Qvic/MPG Trial range of gear and raiding.&amp;nbsp; I can burn through half my mana pool a average fight and soloing with Clarity potion it seems I never run out of mana if I conserve a bit now and then.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Why do you personally think mana is importain??&amp;nbsp; When you choose gear how do you choose??&amp;nbsp; Not to bash anyone or anything but just curious about this point.&amp;nbsp; Personally I go Hit points&amp;gt;Focus&amp;gt;Effects&amp;gt;AC&amp;gt;Resists&amp;gt;stats&amp;gt;looks&amp;gt;then mana.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Ranger or Cleric?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=rangerbalance&amp;message.id=20992#M20992</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I first started playing a couple months after the Kunark expansion and left after the Planes of Power.&amp;nbsp; Recently I saw an old review of EQ and it gave me that nostalgia feeling.&amp;nbsp; Long story short, I&amp;nbsp;started checking the forums and read about the new progression servers on the forums and ran out to get the Titanium edition and am currently giving the servers some time to cool down before I get a fresh start.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Now to the heart of this post.&amp;nbsp; My main back then was a dwarf warrior, but always thought about starting either a ranger or a cleric.&amp;nbsp; Now with the fresh start I am definitely going to make one or the other, but I'm a bit torn and was hoping that I could get a little pro/con session going to help me decide.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I'm also posting a similar thread on the cleric pages to get their opinions.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Ranger agro/deagro issues:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;One of the biggest issues with the ranger class in the current game is agro mechanisms. While triple attack and the addition of Flurry AAs have been a needed boost in melee DPS it also means a large increase in agro, paired with our high agro special attacks ( Direct damage spells ) we often end up very high on agro, and far higher than our DPS accounts for. Until a year or two ago rangers where kings of agro in the sense that we could get it quite easy ( using tangling weeds and Flame lick ) and could loose it fairly easy as well using jolt.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;While general agro have increase tenfold we are still tied to sub level 10 spells to gain agro ( they are far to little agro now to be usefull ), and our jolt line is basicly useless as well since it removes to little agro and it have to deagro when used compared to the high agro generation we have. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Do you have any plans to remedy this?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As a related sidenote: Many of us feel that while epic 2.0 are an invaluable weapon it was a shorterm fix to our highend DPS and we are worried that the day we go back to having to use non class only weapons we will fall back again. Is a longterm ranger melee DPS being talked about as well? ( with lower agro! )&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;(Prathun) I agree that rangers are due for a "jolt" upgrade, and I'll keep that in mind when planning out spells for the next level increase.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Weekly questions</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=rangerbalance&amp;message.id=20951#M20951</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;As most of you likely know we have basicly canned the top 10 lists and are instead permitted to ask 1 question every week to the Devs.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I had hoped I would have gotten a few replies to post by now since so far I have been using the top 10 list I made a few months back ( which never got posted ) but I havent.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anyway so far I have asked about the summit statement that archery should be 85% of melee in regards to especially raid bows since thats where archery falls behind ( its ~60% in CoA+ content ) ( no comment )&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have asked about Warders Wrath, if it would be upped since its so useless in its current state, especially since HoA + TS is so much better and gotten the partial reply that these are meant to give us an option so they will stay linked, but I understood that WW might be looked at sometime in the future.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Finally I have asked about where they see us in regards to taking a beating, especially compared to monks and Berserkers which is also still unreplied too.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have been told that AA and spell questions are on hold for now since Oshran and Prathun are still getting familiar with these systems so until I get told I wont be able to ask questions in those segments.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Anyway, I would like you all to ask questions here so I have ideas which ones to use in the future, and feel free to ask spell/aa questions as well so they are ready when I get a go for those.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The format on how you want to post your questions are up to you, but the better worded your question is the easier I will have using it :smileywink:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Please dont clutter this thread with lots of comments on anything&amp;nbsp;but the questions, if you wanna rant about this new system make a new thread here or something, but you can off course comment on others ideas and such as much as you like. ( this is simply to try and not get this thread to cluttered )&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I am making a similar post on &lt;A href="http://www.EQoutrider.net" target=_blank&gt;www.EQoutrider.net&lt;/A&gt; so you might wanna check that thread out as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I heard a rumor that you can design a macro for "autoshooting" your bow (i.e. it's like auto-attack, but you shoot instead ... that way you don't have to keep clicking "ranged attack" everytime it comes up).&amp;nbsp; Anyone know if this is true?&amp;nbsp; I also heard someone else mention it could only be done with illegal 3rd party programs, which I would not be interested in :-/.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyone know of a "clean, legal" way to autofire a bow?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Upgrade to Levitate overdue?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=rangerbalance&amp;message.id=20934#M20934</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I love to float.&amp;nbsp; I know lots of people hate it, mainly due to the "bob".&amp;nbsp; It actually makes some people sick, and every thread that I find regarding it is about the bob. Whether you love to float or hate it, it is necessary from time to time and for those of us that use it a lot, it's an invaluable tool.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;When I got this spell, it was a level 39 spell (for Rangers) but now has been lowered to level 35.&amp;nbsp; But it still has a base duration of 20.5 minutes and requires a bat wing to cast.&amp;nbsp; With duration AA's and focus I've been able to extend that to a whopping 36 minutes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;At level 65 we finally received Spirit of Eagle.&amp;nbsp; Woot!&amp;nbsp; No bat wing required and has a base duration of 60 minutes - with extensions I can squeeze 78 minutes out of it.&amp;nbsp; But, like Spirit of Wolf, it's an outdoor-only cast.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The issue arises in situations like Riftseekers Sanctum, for example.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;To get there you have to travel through Muramite Proving Grounds, which has a no-levitation flag on the zone.&amp;nbsp; Why they flagged this completely flat zone as no-levitation is beyond me (haven't been everywhere there yet, but have yet to see any reason to strip lev here)...but in getting to RS, you have to go through MPG, thereby losing your long-lasting SoE.&amp;nbsp; Then, if you are going to be taking on any mob that will&amp;nbsp;GFlux, you have to make do with that old and busted short-duration levitate - and be sure to have more bat wings on ya.....sigh.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Don't ya think we are a bit overdue for an upgrade to this spell at least?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;As nice as it would be to be able to cast SoE indoors, I'd be happy just to be able to cast Levitation.&amp;nbsp; You know, the one that has the same duration as Levitate, but doesn't&amp;nbsp;eat a @#$% bat wing and that Druids, Shamans, Wizzies and Enchanters all get.&amp;nbsp; Or something that parallel's the Dead Man Floating that Necro's get.&amp;nbsp; No run speed increase but&amp;nbsp;it at least has a long duration.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Agree?&amp;nbsp; Disagree?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Discuss please.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Nature's Bounty Question</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=rangerbalance&amp;message.id=20923#M20923</link>
      <description>I've been foraging in Elddar to get the fallen treant branch thingies&#xD;
for the last couple weeks. I recently bought Nature's Bounty 1 and&#xD;
noticed something I really didn't like....&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
From looking at my logs, before Nature's Bounty I averaged a little over 5 branches per hour. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
In the 3 days since I've gotten Nature's Bounty 1, I've gotten....2 branches. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;

Is there some bug I don't know about where Nature's Bounty prevents rare items on the forage table from actually appearing?&lt;br&gt;&#xD;

      <title>Ranger Tank?</title>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I was curious if Rangers make good tanks all the way up to lvl 70?&amp;nbsp; Assume&amp;nbsp;he is &amp;nbsp;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;VERY&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt; well geared but with no AA's.&amp;nbsp; There is a slower in group and a Cleric.&amp;nbsp; Could a Ranger do a good enough job tanking to be the MT in a group of 4?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>It is quite obvious to me that nobody from SOE bothers to visit the class forums any more. The Top-10 issues list hasn't been looked at since the beginning of January. Valid questions that are posed in the class forums are largely ignored. The only way to get any kind of response is to post in other generic forums.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No, I am not leaving the game. No, you cannot have my stuff. I am not even leaving the SOE forums. I am leaving the class forums. They are a complete and total waste of disk space and bandwidth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See you all around.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Elddar's Grasp Losing Knockback?</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=rangerbalance&amp;message.id=20890#M20890</link>
      <description>If Lucy is to be believed Elddar's Grasp has lost its knockback on test. Considering the spell has only 100 range and a long recast this is a significant loss. The knockback has been valuable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The auras other classes get seem to be worth a few percent, chanters get 6/tick mana, clerics 3% mitigation and so forth. Every little bit counts and every couple of percent adds up. But a new root to make up for the fact that our old ones have been made useless by tremendous mob resists? It should at least be useful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a most unwelcome change.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rashere has given us some much needed love, first he has 'fixed' the untrackable mob issue found in many zones.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=219256#M219256"&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;amp;message.id=219256#M219256&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now he is going to raise our taunt cap to 200 (same level as warrior at level 50, I think.  Don't rip me a new one if I am wrong about warrior taunt cap), so we will not be nerfed by the upcoming taunt change.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=222552#M222552"&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;amp;message.id=222552#M222552&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What this means is that taunt will remain a viable ranger aggro grabbing tool for CC and OT purpose, and we will not resorting to casting tangle weed and flame lick for aggro grabbing tool.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Please send Rashere your love.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Summit Report:</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=rangerbalance&amp;message.id=20852#M20852</link>
      <description>Posted this on EQOutrider, figured I'd do the dutiful thing and post it here too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="postbody"&gt;Part 1:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A leader from a movie about the American Revolution that involved famous figures from American history breaking out into song and dance while also being grim and serious once said something along the lines of &amp;quot;it is foolish for a leader to go against his own intuition, even if it is against what his peers and followers think.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps that line could best summarize the Summit for me, without going into further detail, but I suppose it'd be a good idea to give my regards and post something that resembles an 'official' document for the public. Hopefully people don't player hate too much!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I arrived at the Marriott Marquis in Atlanta early in the morning on Thursday, a good 8 or so hours at least before the fan faire kicked off, having plans to meet Maddoc there at about 8 o'clock and head off to summit shortly there after. I arrived at 7:45, and Maddoc finally got downstairs into the ('freaking huge' best describes it, at least 3 floors) lobby about an hour later, which given his average response rate of ~2 hours, it was probably a bit early for him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aside from the initial difficulty in trying to pronounce my name to people (my attempt to abbreviate ended up in most people not making the Nend to Nendiilya connection), things went pretty well beforehand, and when things go pretty well they're kinda dull and boring, so I'll leave it at that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first topic of discussion was how to get newer players into the game, whether they're just plain new or old players returning from the 7th level of hell (or World of Warcraft). Among the first sub-topics in this list was the AA system (or maybe it came later, I'm a bad note-taker) and how to solve it's problems (i.e. too many AA in the game making it too hard for new people to catch up).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of my favorite ideas that were posted was unlocking some aa for newer players at each level, the example posed was at 62 a Ranger 'needs' Endless Quiver, so at 51 you get 3 aa for a general ability, at 55-59 18 aa for an archetype ability, and at 59-62 the remainder needed for Endless Quiver. That particular idea was put forth by Naladini as I recall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another viable alternative was the implementation of quests that yield specific exp for specific AA's, not unlike 'unlocking' the AA from MPG group trials or DoN raid progression. The next was simply making AA's that cost 50-100 (eventually anyway, point is expensive aa's) for a single skill up. The problem as I see it with that one in particular is that it doesn't solve the fundamental problem- things just get more and more expensive (as exp gets easier (like getting 5 aa now in the time it took to get half of one in Luclin)) for less and less gain, so really it seems to be just delaying the inevitable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The idea I put forth was simply taking AA's out all together and in their stead provide each expansion with a long in depth quest that takes you through all (or a lot of) the expansions content, (the only real example of this is the BiC) the fundamental premise behind this concept is that most players who want more aa's just want something more to do, and as long as there is something to do in the single group with adequate reward, people will continue to group and have something to occupy their time, while letting the rest of the population catch up. It has flaws alone, but combined with giving or unlocking aa rewards along the lines of quests or exping (not unlike the DoN progression), or simply alternating between aa expansion and non-aa expansion, it works out pretty well in theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another idea was to have 'one-shot' aa's where you spend 5 aa's or so for an ability that has one charge, that one seemed pretty popular, but I dislike exping over and over again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A sub-topic within the main topic here that I brought up was retention of old veteran players being just as important as regaining old/new members. The background here is that previous item x1.15 is boring even if the item is great, so as a result people are less motivated to stick around (i.e. tired of same loot types). Combine this with the problem of raid loot inflation in the game, the solution I presented (that i've also been marketing for years, btw) is a segregation between raid and group gear (and no, not widening the gulf, like quite a few first assumed).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Essentially, people raid now-a-days to increase their ability to raid, not really to group (that's just an added bonus). Originally in EQ you raided to be better at grouping, and under that fundamental the system is great. However, since there is a completely different fundamental now than there was then, a change is required in the sense that when you raid, the gear drops you obtain should only effect your ability to raid. The side bonus to this is that it also encourages people to group outside of raiding and have a way to progress their character outside of raids without doing something ridiculous like grinding 1535 aa's.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Initially the system couldn't totally go forth into only raid stats, since that wouldn't fly well, but a hybrid system of keeping current stat values consistent or only gain very little while the major focus being the raid stats would probably get people to warm up to the idea. 370 hp would simply become the goal for single group encounters to reach 3-5 years down the road. In that regard 12-18 man events (would probably require instancing) could be put in for 'high end' group gear, so there is still that segment of division between one grouping and coordinating multiple groups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thats about as accurate as I can recall for now, after that we got a preview of the new Nektulos forest and a break for the next segments, which I have to say is a nice improvement to the old-new one. It has a more original Nektulos feel to it and there is no stupid tree line that blocks you anymore. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I also have a lvl 70 sk that i have not AAed much until the last double exp from sony, i was earning aa very fast so bought him the line of dot crit aa and wow did this push his dps up on my parses i always try and use 2 dots with him and found myself useing three now but it seems to me which is so long ago i cant remember that these dot crit aa did more for my SK dps then any ranger line of aa i have bought for my ranger.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If so what gives if i am mistaken then sorry for this post, I just think if i am not mistaking things then rangers should get just as much dps gains for there aa. All i am trying to say here is that it seems that my sk paid the same or less aa for better dps increases which if is true then its wrong.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Tracking Mastery</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=rangerbalance&amp;message.id=20818#M20818</link>
      <description>I posted this in the wrong section earlier, so figured I try here, hope it's the right spot. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About 5 months ago, I purchased the AA tracking mastery.  I then maxed it to 300 over the next few weeks.  I spent the 15 aa's so I could check on mobs in Sol Ro and PoTactics.  Was a huge disappointment because I couldn't tell the difference, same spots as before to get any mini's on track, same with other zones etc etc etc.  Anyway, that's not the point. I spent alot of time mashing my &amp;lt;F5&amp;gt; key down while fighting.  One day, about 3 months ago, I was checking my track and noticed a skill up from 200 to 201.  I was in shock.  I immediatly /petitioned and received a reply that it was an &amp;quot;Old&amp;quot; issue or something along those lines.  I /bugged it.  After hearing nothing, I then spent the next two weeks raising it again, thinking it was weird but maybe they were just having issues.   The only idea I coud think was server rollback, but it couldn't be that because if servers rolled back, they wouldn't roll back 2-3 weeks worth of tracking.  None the less, I maxed my tracking out again.  Last night, while avoiding Fabled Gore, in DL, I noticed my tracking skill up again from 200 to 201.  I was furious, and /petitioned again.  This time, GM Pancul or whatever the gm's name on Drinal is, said that he/she checked my tracking on saved file, and found my tracking was at 200 and there was no proof to show I was at 300 so he/she couldn't refund my AA's (which I wanted).  My word against SoE's, so basically I loose, which I don't blame them, it's a good rule.  I /bugged it again and haven't heard back from them, have no idea if they will even let me know.  Anyway, I was just wondering.  Has anyone heard of anything like this before?  I now am logging everything, and on EQcompanion, it says my tracking is at 240.  Which in game, it says only 201.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would appreciate any and all insight into this, as it is driving me mad. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
