    <description>Unfortunately, I cannot confirm for certain that Windows ME will support the newest update of DirectX 9.0c.  &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/support/endofsupport.mspx" target=_blank&gt;Microsoft has forcibly dropped all support for Windows ME and Windows 98/98SE&lt;/a&gt;.  They have stranded thousands of their customers and removed support from many of their updates and applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before they did that, I would have guaranteed that the DirectX 9.0c (April 2006) update would have worked with Windows ME and 98SE, but now I cannot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you wish to voice your concerns on this issue, please contact &lt;a href="http://support.microsoft.com/" target=_blank&gt;Microsoft's Customer Service&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

      <title>DirectX 9.0c and Windows ME</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=tech&amp;message.id=127144#M127144</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Okay, it is now Thursday, Jun 15, 2006.&amp;nbsp; I have downloaded the correct version of DirectX 9.0c, (april re-distributed) and it is on my system, I have GeForce 5500 video card, with the correctly downloaded and installed driver, but I am STILL getting message, NO 3D Devices found??????&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Have spoken with SIX different TSR's on tech support line, and ALL of them are now suggesting I go out and purchase Windows XP.&amp;nbsp; However, after reading some of these other posts, seems people with Windows XP are also having same error message NO 3D Devices found?&amp;nbsp; I have been told that as of July 11, 2006 Microsoft will no longer be SUPPORTING Windows ME.&amp;nbsp; I was now told that Everquest Technical support will now no longer support Windows ME,&amp;nbsp; so after all this here is my question, IS Windows ME COMPATIBLE with DirectX 9.0c or not?????&amp;nbsp; Is anyone out there at this moment running Everquest on their system with no problems that has Windows ME as their OS, any help would be appreciated!!&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;nbsp; You might consider holding off on the new computer for about a month if money is an issue. Intel and AMD have a nice little price war scheduled for late July. From bloomberg:&lt;br&gt;" Intel said it will reduce prices of faster dual-core chips by about 15 percent, according to Alex Lin, a product marketing manager at Micro-Star, Taiwan's third-largest maker of motherboards, which connect electronic parts in computers. Intel also told him that it plans to lower Pentium prices by 60 percent."&lt;br&gt;http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000087&amp;amp;sid=a9bSLIkNBj4M&lt;br&gt;and from digg:&lt;br&gt;"AMD will drastically cut prices on its desktop processors after the July 23rd release of Intel 's Core 2 Duo Conroe processors. * AMD Athlon 64 price cuts will receive price cut up to 30% * AMD Athlon 64 X2 will receive price cuts up to 50% * AMD Sempron processors will receive price cuts up to 15%"&lt;br&gt;http://digg.com/tech_news/AMD_Plans_Major_CPU_Price_Drops_Day_After_Conroe_&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; That's interesting that the Direct Draw and Direct 3D tests passed. If you were generating the same "No 3D Device Found" error for all applications it should have come up as "Test Failed at step 8 (creating 3D device): HRESULT 0x80004005 (generic failure) " That you didn't would indicate to me that there is a problem with Everquest directly. Double check the Everquest directory to make sure there are no "d3d" files in it (go up to View&amp;gt;Arrange Icons&amp;gt;By Name). If there are no d3d files in the directory and if you have broadband you might consider renaming your entire Everquest directory to something like OldEverquest or BadEverquest, then create a new, empty Everquest folder, download the patcher from:&lt;br&gt;http://help.station.sony.com/cgi-bin/soe.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=16165&lt;br&gt;unpack it, put the new EverQuest.exe into the empty everquest directory and run it. Click on play and see if it solves the problem. If you're on dialup I wouldn't recommend this path as an experiment, it's several gigabyte worth of download. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; When you go to install XP on the old computer I'd recommend booting to the cd, and deleting the old FAT32 partition on the hard drive and reformatting using NTFS. I have found XP running on FAT32 to be unacceptably laggy. Also as WingRider_01 said it wouldn't be a bad idea to just buy a new hard drive, jumper it as the primary, rejumper the old one as a slave, and install XP fresh onto the new hard drive, using the old one as a backup device. Hard drives are dirt cheap nowadays.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; Good Luck&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;When doing the DirectDraw test and the DirectX 3D test in DxDiag, everything passes.&amp;nbsp; Still can't get my DxDiag file posted into this thread, just not working, think my toolbar may be screwed up.&amp;nbsp; Or I am.&amp;nbsp; But, I do know how to send my DxDiag file and MsInfo file in an e-mail attatchment, if anyone would be interested in looking at it.&amp;nbsp; Have also already sent them to a Senior Tech Eric Rebelas and he replied that I have corrupted files.&amp;nbsp; I also seem to have "Inactive Display Entries in Registry"&amp;nbsp; that I have tried several times to clean out.&amp;nbsp; These entries are dealing with my older video card GeForce 2 MX/MX 400 (I have 10 entries there) and 3 or 4 entries of the new GeForce 5500 card.&amp;nbsp; I went into Safe Mode, and clicked on display adapter, but did not see these "ghost drivers" there to delete them in safe mode.&amp;nbsp; I also tried to use Registry Cleaner to clean them out, no luck?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If anyone would even consider checking out my DxDiag files and MsInfo files thru an e-mail, would be very appreciative, although that is asking alot, and would totally understand if uninterested.&amp;nbsp; Again, going to purchase WindowsXP SP2 and most likely another new system anyways.&amp;nbsp; Just really not wanting to give up on this system yet.&amp;nbsp; Everything and I mean EVERYTHING is running as usual on this system, EXCEPT EQ!!&amp;nbsp; :smileywink:&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;To touch upon an earlier point can you paste in here using Ctrl-V? &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also I may have missed it but you may try looking for a "driver cleaner" utililty to clean out thoe ghost drivers in your DxDiag.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Well, I have decided to just go out and get Windows XP SP2 and see if that fixes problem, and most likely, even after doing that, going to purchase another computer anyway.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, have a few other questions before doing this.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;1).&amp;nbsp; Which is preferred in buying new system, Integrated Graphics on Motherboard, or Graphics card?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2).&amp;nbsp; AMD Athlon &amp;gt; AMD Sempron;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Intel Pentium &amp;gt; Intel Celeron.&amp;nbsp; But is AMD Athlon &amp;gt; then Intel Pentium.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;3).&amp;nbsp; Pentium D is next step or steps UP from Pentium 4?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;4.) Windows XP SP2 greater or lesser OS then Windows Media Edition?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Once I purchase Windows XP SP2 for THIS system, to try and fix problems, will all "corrupted files" that might be on my system be, how shall we say it, "takin care of"?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Any help with this and any other suggestions on buying new system would be greatly appreciated, not caring about spending the money, just concerned about working properly!&amp;nbsp; Thanx for everything!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;1).&amp;nbsp; Which is preferred in buying new system, Integrated Graphics on Motherboard, or Graphics card?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;run away from any system that has a integrated graphics on the motherboard for gaming, they work fine for regualr business and surfing but die a horrible death on gaming. Look only at systems with the add on crads. IG chipsets are normally low end implementations of the chipset and lack a lot of capabilities, but they are cheap and simple for the manufacturers to add to the board&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;2).&amp;nbsp; AMD Athlon &amp;gt; AMD Sempron;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Intel Pentium &amp;gt; Intel Celeron.&amp;nbsp; But is AMD Athlon &amp;gt; then Intel Pentium.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;correct in the first 4 but as far as AMD/Intel not going to get into that, depending on what you use the system for each has it's strenghts and weaknesses, best bet is to select a base system to what you will use it for primarily then check the reviews on it. I utilze both, gaming is my AMD boxes, video processing is my Intel boxes. Only thing that is the same is the video brand I am a Nvidia bigot and a ATI despiser - but that was from personal expierence&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;3).&amp;nbsp; Pentium D is next step or steps UP from Pentium 4?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Yes, it is also the format for the new 805 series lower cost dual cores by intel. Socket T (775)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;4.) Windows XP SP2 greater or lesser OS then Windows Media Edition?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Again, depends on what you want to use it for, I have both, but the windows media edition is on the box that is in the entertainment center and my game boxes utilize XP-SP2 Professional, I am not a big supporter of the home version, prefer the extra security from the professional version. costs more but worth it in my opinion&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Once I purchase Windows XP SP2 for THIS system, to try and fix problems, will all "corrupted files" that might be on my system be, how shall we say it, "takin care of"?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Depends on how you install it, not sure if Me is a valid update path to XP, but what I would suggest is that you backup your important data and do a format install of XP, you are expierencing problems now on the ME configuration and they just my transfer over to the XP system on upgrade, if you system was stable and fully funcitonal the upgrade would be the least painful path, but you are having problems and better to start fresh. Disk drives are cheap right now, you might even consider buying a new drive installing that as a master and using your old me drive as a slave. One thing to note, everquest does not require a install program, you can back up your current install to another drive or media, then transfer it to the new install, create a new shortcut and you are off to the races&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Any help with this and any other suggestions on buying new system would be greatly appreciated, not caring about spending the money, just concerned about working properly!&amp;nbsp; Thanx for everything!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;One note - buy from a reputable location, Dell makes some decent equipment for gaming now, but don't overlook the local mom and pop shops, they can put out some decent boxes at low costs and the advantage there is you have someone local that you can beat around the head and shoulders if there is an issue. IfThe advantage to dell is their warrenty and telephone support if you have problems. Make sure you do not get a intergrated graphics card on the new system. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;good point, I do use Media Edition but not on my gaming machine, not much truely support XP-64 also, better to stay mainstream XP-Pro as a first choice, XP-home as a second choice, just plan ahead and get a machine that is Vista capabile depending on how long you keep your machines</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;It was posted here that this is a AGP card and I have to have THAT enabled in DxDiag.  Well, it is not, and this could also be the case. &lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just to get some clarifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.  What error message are you currently getting?  Is it the No 3d Device found error?  Is this the only error you are currently getting?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2.  Is your current video card an AGP card?  If it is not, the AGP acceleration in the Dxdiag does not matter.  If it is an AGP card, and AGP acceleration is not enabled and not toggleable in the dxdiag, then there is a problem with the AGP driver.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;a)  Physically remove and reset the video card.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;b) Obtain and install the newest motherboard/chipset drivers.  May need to repeat this step a few times, first in safe mode.  My Asus motherboard using WinME needed to be babied like that.&lt;br&gt;Can not tell you what to get since the dxdiag and msinfo that was requested was never posted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;c)  Obtain and install/reinstall the suggested video card drivers.  It would be smart to uninstall the current ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once installed, without removing them again, you may need to repeat the drivers installations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;d)  In the Window's Display Properties, troubleshooting section, make sure the Hardware acceleration is set at 100%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;e)  Open up dxdiag to check to see if the AGP acceleration is not grayed out, and that all the buttons are toggleable enabled/disabled.</description>

      <description>Well, CSoul612, I can't point you directly at any specific hardware, but I recently purchased the components to build a Socket 939-based (Athlon 64) computer for under $300, excluding harddrive, memory, video card, and power supply, which I carried over from my previous system.</description>

      <description>&amp;nbsp; For Windows ME it is normal for the d3d files to all be in c:\windows\system and no d3d files located in c:\windows\system32. I just checked 3 different computers running ME and that is where it's located in all of them. So that shouldn't be a problem.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; As for the dxdiag reporting the correct version number, but not the correct version name, if it were a computer I was working on I'd take that as a very sure sign that the system had become corrupted and go for a fresh install of ME. I've always found ME to run best if it is reinstalled on a semi regular basis, eg those kind of little errors tend to start popping up after about a year's normal use. You can try running them down, but it tends to be a large waste of time trying to squish all the little bugs that start popping up once it begins to exhibit symptoms of corruption. You *could* try reinstalling ME over itself, but I wouldn't give it a large chance of correcting the bug.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; Before going any further I'd make sure to have a good backup of important things, like the Everquest directory. :)&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; Got to ask again, does it pass or fail the "Test Direct Draw" and "Test Direct 3D" tests under the Display tab in dxdiag? You have to click the buttons to run the tests. If it fails them it is a problem with the system, if it passes them it is a problem with everquest. If it does fail can you list the step it fails at (eg step 8).&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; I know a LOT of folk that have had problems with the overclocked GeForce 5 series. Go into the advanced section of the display properties, click on the GeForce tab and see if you have the option to lower the speed on the card. I have seen so many problems with that series that I now do this as normal maintenance whenever I run across them. You won't be able to notice a difference in performance, but it should improve stability of the card greatly.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; Another thing I just thought of, open the case and check that the cpu fan and chipset fan are both spinning freely, I'm starting to run into a lot of chipset fans getting clogged with just a little bit of dust and not spinning fast enough to keep the chipset cool. Usually the&amp;nbsp; cpu fan is beefy enough to be able to ignore a little bit of fuzz, but even a strand or two&amp;nbsp; of dustbunny is enough to slow down or stop chipset fans and start causing&amp;nbsp; strange errors.&amp;nbsp; I don't think this is the problem because the errors tend to be random, but it is a good general maintenance item since you're servicing your computer anyway.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; To paste into this forum I have to use Notepad or Wordpad and click on the Edit button up top and select Paste there. Whenever I try to use Microsoft Word it never seems to work right.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; I'll mention again, because it's important. The vulnerability in Me and 98 is a large security problem. As of yesterday I have ordered copies of XP or 2000 for everyone I know of that uses ME or 98 and are connected to the internet in any way. One friend has chosen to stay with ME, but only because he has no important data on that computer and it isn't a hardship for him to f-disk and reinstall if he gets attacked.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; One thing of note, if you do buy a copy of XP for this system and it has problems it is fairly easy for Microsoft to diagnose and work on the problem from their end much easier than with ME. Also as odd as it sounds, for several of my friends they have chosen to just buy&amp;nbsp; a new computer rather than upgrading their old ones with XP. It's absolutely amazing what they are geting for a few hundred dollars more than the cost of a copy of Windows XP.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; Another thing to think of, an unscrupulous person could download a pirated copy of XP off the net and install it to see if it corrects the problem, and if it does f-disk the hard drive and go out to buy a real licensed copy from Microsoft.&amp;nbsp; That way they'd have a good idea what the results would be before buying a pig-in-a-poke from Bill Gates. They would have to assume the copy they downloaded is infected with nasty things and whatever the results would require wiping the hard drive afterward.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; Hope some of this advice helps ya', let us know how it goes. :)&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I appreciate the last few replies to my post, when I asked for any more "bright ideas" in no way was I trying to be a smart ass, because most of the time, that is EXACTLY what you get from posting here, very bright ideas as to how to handle a situation that you shouldn't have to just to play a game.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As for posting my dxdiag and my msinfo files, for some reason I can copy those files, but can't or am unsure how to "paste" to my thread here, since when I try to, the option to "paste" them is greyed out or is not available to me.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;After discussing what has happened over the last 2 weeks with my lady, we are really torn as to what route to go to try and get back to playing EQ, we are considering buying Windows XP SP2, but we are also considering just buying a brand new computer.&amp;nbsp; We may even do both, since if Windows XP SP2 DOES fix this problem we will again have TWO computers to play on, and we can get back to playing together again.&amp;nbsp; However, after scouring these forums, and reading that people have been running DirectX 9.0c for months prior to the patch, just to find out THEY couldn't get on either, and they DO have Windows XP SP2, I am afraid that if I purchase Windows XP Sp2, that may not even correct this problem.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also, I have asked several times, I am showing that I have d3dx9_30.dll on my system, as well as d3dx9_25, 26, 27, 28 and 29 also, but they are in my C:\Windows\System file and NOT in my C:\Windows\System32 file.&amp;nbsp; Could this be a problem.&amp;nbsp; I will check to see if I have any d3d files in my EQ directory.&amp;nbsp; One last thing, My Video card that is installed with the 71.84 drivers is a GeForce 5500 overclocked 256 mb ddr.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It was posted here that this is a AGP card and I have to have THAT enabled in DxDiag.&amp;nbsp; Well, it is not, and this could also be the case.&amp;nbsp; As for the "signed" drivers for DxDiag, do not think that is the problem, since every time I have run DxDiag, I have not had the "signed" part checked.&amp;nbsp; Again, appreciate all the attention my post has received from EVERYONE and my frustration hopefully is understood.&amp;nbsp; Going to do more work and see what I can come up with!&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>When you run dxdiag.exe does it pass the Test Direct Draw and Test Direct 3D tests under the Display Tab? Also does it report the correct amount of video memory after "Approx. Total Memory=" in the upper left box in the Display tab? I've seen other ME computers exhibit video problems after the upgrade to April 9.0c.&lt;br&gt;On a Windows ME box running EQ correctly right now&amp;nbsp; DXDiag&amp;nbsp; lists the DX version as: "DirectX Version: DirectX 9.0c(4.09.000.0904)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few things you could try.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; Do a search of you everquest directory. If there are *any* files that start with "d3d" in your main everquest directory remove them, they will cause this error. All of your d3d*.dll files should be located in c:\windows\system for windows ME.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; In your bios check the AGP Appature size and make sure it is set for 64 or 128 MB&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; In your bios if the AGP speed is set for 8X try setting it to 4X; or if it is set at 4X try setting it to 2X. If this doesn't fix the problem feel free to set it back to it's default.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; You may have to update your motherboard drivers, specifically the AGP controller. If you did this before installing the April dx9.0c you may try reinstalling the original drivers that came with the motherboard. If you change your motherboard drivers you will have to reinstall the April dx9.0c again so it can configure itself correctly.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; Several friends have had problems getting the latest few versions of NVidia drivers to work with their older motherboards and dx9.0c. You may try using an older driver and see if it helps. So far version 71.84 is the only one that seems to work for everyone. It can be downloaded at: http://www.nvidia.com/object/win9x_71.84.html. You *must* uninstall the version you are using now in add/remove program before installing a new video driver to prevent problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;These were solutions to friends that had similar problems when they went to the April dx9.0c. Without seeing the comp and without info like the DXDiag.txt and MSInfo.txt information all I can do is kinda' shotgun the advice.&lt;br&gt;Windows ME will work with EQ and DX 9.0c, but it seems to require quite a bit of effort to balance the juggling act to make it work right. Specificaly the AGP controller seems to be very sensitive to dx9.0c on the ~1GHz era motherboards. One thing of note, I don't believe in running out and buying new operating systems when the old ones do the job (ie, typing this on a ME machine right now), but the vulnerability Microsoft is reporting in 98 and ME that they are not writing a fix for is worth being worried about. For that reason alone I will likely abandon ME soon and move to XP (or windows 2000 if I can find a copy for a reasonable price) before some idiot comes up with a virus or worm that targets it. Right now it's got "kick me" written all over it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good luck.&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Ok, so that out of the way.  You were asked to post dxdiag and msinfo, with the link to the exact how and what in the post.&lt;br&gt;2.  Directx 9c April/June 2006 updates just fine on WinMe systems.  As noted, the 4.09.0000.0904 is the number for directx 9c.  Which means you likely have a few corrupt system files.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3.  Lets leave the directx naming problem behind, and concentrate on the no 3d device found.&lt;br&gt;a)  Video card is a AGP slotted card but the Hardware Acceleration either turned down or disabled.  Disabled can be seen via the dxdiag, turned down via the Display Controls.&lt;br&gt;b)  You have more system files in your EQ folder.  Easiest way to check and eliminate it is to copy only everquest.exe to a newly created EQ folder, double click on it to repatch the game, making sure to check the expansions in the Advanved section.  Right click, Send to... Desktop (create shortcut) for later use.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As to how the system files came to be in the EQ folder?  Likely from 3rd party programs, not all evil, but many were created and packages with system files to ensure the program worked, and many players attempted to make it easy for themselves by loading/unpacking them into their EQ directory.</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It might be the time to start talking to Microsoft since it appears that your Opeating System will not install a standard upgrade&amp;nbsp;to itself, or evendo a fresh format and install.&amp;nbsp;I know on windows 2000, windows xp, windows&amp;nbsp;vista&amp;nbsp;the files belong in the ..\windows\system32 directory not sure where it belongs in a windows ME system. Do not even have a copy of ME to install on a VMWare instance to check it out. This is basicly a OS problem now, not sure how else you can be assisted here. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Okay, seems I may have "stumbled" onto MY problem.&amp;nbsp; Yes there are 3 different versions of the DXwebsetup on DirectX Website.&amp;nbsp; Looking closer, I have noticed that the DirectX Version 9.0c April 2006 re-dist version and the DirectX Version 9.0c June 2006 re-dist are saying they ARE compatible with Windows ME.&amp;nbsp; However, if I am needing to download and install the&amp;nbsp;DXWEBSETUP &amp;nbsp;versions of either of these, April 2006, or June 2006, THEY are NOT compatible with Windows ME as listed under supported operating systems.&amp;nbsp; So, If I am not a total noob, I have reason to believe now that I will have to upgrade to Windows XP Service Pack 2, and THEN and only THEN will the DXWEBSETUP versions of April 2006 or June 2006 correctly load and install onto my system?????&amp;nbsp; Am I wrong?&amp;nbsp; Could I be right?&amp;nbsp; Only MIT may know!&amp;nbsp; =)&amp;nbsp; =)</description>
