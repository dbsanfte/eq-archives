      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; IMO you ( the OP ) needs to stop whining about retarded **FROGLOK**. boo hoo warriors get something i dont have. Welcome to everquest. you think people just stroll into fire and pull a shakerpage pull like that with no effort no preperations nothing at all? YOUR **FROGLOK**ING WRONG!!! IMO what xp these people get is  well deserved and well earned for the amount of resources , skill and preperation it takes to successfully pull this off. Let me ask you another question. Necromancers are the ONLY class that can successfully and efficiently solo good aa points in the Crypt of Decay by using there undead charm spell. Should they be nerfed too? so sick of hearing stupid ass rants about pointless stuff on veterans forums instaed of complaining about every little thing you think is not perfect in your eyes why not sit back and play the game like it was meant to be played. my god everquest allready is all noobed up from its original version&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allanim Highlife&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Assent&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Re: BiC &amp; Txevu request</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=222246#M222246</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;have to say i agree with everyone else who says dont change anything about the BiC. Like many have said before your guild doesnt kill Zun? your guild doesnt clear Inktuta? well does your guild want completed BiC augment quests?  if you answer no to the first 2 questions but answered yes to the third question i think maybe you need to take a step back and figure out if it is important enough to your guild. yes i understand some of you guys are in guilds more focusing on anguish / vishimtar / demiplane and por. but honestly txevu zun is easy pick up raid and inktuta is even more easier imo. only aspect that i could see giving people trouble doing these pick up would be that it is IMPOSSIBLE to get past stonemites in Inktuta without 40 people. for the reason that there must be 10 people in each room when u say the phrase to the 4 npcs. Just speaking from personal experience when my guild beat OMM and we had Vishimtar allready on farm mode we hit everything that was of any use at all to us. This included but was not limited to epic 2.0's , all 6 MPG trials , Inktuta , Txevu Zun , Full Tacvi , Full Anguish , Rikkukin , Kessedona , Yar Lir , Vishimtar and we still had about 2 days off to jerk it. inktuta with a full guild takes a little over 30 mins if you have done the events and know how they work and your guild works good together and longest part about zun in Txevu is clearing to him. over all i think Assent netted somewhere around 50ish fully completed BiC quests and about 20 or 30 tongue quests. These raids are still fun to do and net great drops for Alternates and Applicants . currently Assent clears Tacvi Anguish and Yar Lir pick up styles in the off hours of the week. the BiC has allready made leaps and bounds to become more player friendly of a quest and a little bit more obtainable for anyone imo. it is still the BEST type 4 augment in the game and as so it should not be easy to obtain. Guilds should have to bust there ass and suck up doing the old content if they want the BiC in my opinion. hope noone takes offense to anything i say or thinks im tryng to be little then cause that is nto my intention at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allanim Highlife&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Assent&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Wondering what the timers are on Vex Thal nameds</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=221569#M221569</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;Cant remember but think i heard a rumor the spawn times were changed. If this is so was just wondering if anyone knows the approximate if not exact spawn time on the named mobs in the zone. if they were not changed please remind me what the spawn timers are on this zone. cause its been along long time since i have stepped foot into this zone. Thank you in advance would really appreciate the info 8 )&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Allanim Highlife&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &amp;lt;Assent&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decort wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;The quantity of people that currently play in VT speaks for itself.  The quest is no longer in line with the zone it unlocks, or there would be more folks using it.  It is being unused and ignored by the overwhelming bulk of newer players.  If a pathetically low level of zone use is the goal, then bravo, mission accomplished and the process should remain as it is. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Even if it means they have an easier time getting in than I did, I would rather see  folks in there playing.  I'd like to see em in there playing their own class as opposed to sitting around doing MM's.  I'd like to see folks gaining some knowledge/skills/experience/gear killing some of the same mobs I did.  I would like to see more folks get a taste for raiding at level 60+, rather than thinking all raiding/EQ begins at 70. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quantity of the people playing in vex thal does not mean anything other than the fact that Luclin is an old expansion people have moved on most guilds are far past Vex Thal. you say you wanna see people playing there own class and not sitting around doing monster missions . you say you want to see people get a taste for raiding at 60+ rather than thinking all raiding starts at lvl 70? ummmm that is what the quest is  for  working as a guild to obtain 1 long term goal AKA entering Vex Thal. from your post it seems like your saying level 60 + characters are going to be able to progress in here as a small group which is far from the truth. yes Vex Thal was a level 60 zone but you didnt raid it with 30ish people at that level even with your guild heavily decked out in ToV armor / Primals for dps / Ssra and other high end raid content of velious armor and weapons . i would wager clearing it with 30 or lower would be pretty tought if  not impossible due to respawn time and the overwhelming number of mobs you usually have in camp at a time in Vex Thal. with a force that small in gear that was top end for those days i still say you chance for survival would be minimum not to mention that the margin for error would be pretty bad as well. Now days if you have a character that has very good gear and the oodles and oodles of helpful defensive offensive and skill specific aa's. its possible to 1 group the whole zone ( would probably take a **SMURF** long time with little afk at all ) but it could be done. just because a zone is empty and noone frequents it anymore is no justification as to opening the zone or changing the way the quest is done. EVERYONE who has entered vex thal wether there were first or last or somewhere in between has had to do the same quest.  Maybe its just me that feels this way but unkeying the zone and allowing anyone to just zone in at will would completely ruin the concept of an End Game zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allanim Highlife&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Assent&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Hey i have a WONDERFUL IDEA&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;  Zrath why dont you do the quest and find out how long it takes to do it? theres a bright idea .&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;and just for the record full VT key can be completed in 24 hours if you  1 ) have the will to do it and 2 ) have a force to kill emperor and he is up. i fully keyed a friend on Rodcet nife a few years ago in 1 day . so you all smoking some really good crack if you think it takes to **SMURF** long&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;and as for you being a casual player and only being able to play 3 hours a day that isnt anyone elses decision but your own and im sure you have good reason as to why you can only play that long but others also have good reason as to why the can stay on all day and farm the key in a matter of days not weeks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Allanim Highlife&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;lt;Assent&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
