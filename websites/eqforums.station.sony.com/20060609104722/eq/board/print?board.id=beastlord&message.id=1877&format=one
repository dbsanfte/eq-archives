The regen the pet gets from the focus only kicks in if the pet is <EM>not </em>attacking. I duo with my wife all the time, a mage. Don't know where you got the idea I was talking about soloing. I hate soloing. What I was saying was that the only time you would want to take advantage of sitting the pet down during the fight to have it regen is when you are doing mobs you can solo, otherwise the pet's regen will not keep up with any mob beating on it. If you think sitting a pet down while its getting beat by a mob in Kod'Taz will save it you are mistaken about how good the regen is. Now if you have the pet focus from Time or GoD and the Pet Affinity AA the pet may be able to off tank in Kod'Taz. I know for a fact Mage pets with Pet Affinity, Time Focus and pet defensive AA's can tank in Kod'Taz. However, we don't get the pet defensive AA's Mages do.</p><P>I could see this tactic being more useful for folks whose pet is actually the better tank. I surpassed my pet's ability to tank a long time ago and the groups I play with can earn 3 AA's an hour these days. Again, its about efficiency of the tactic. If you are using the tactic of sitting your pet down so it can regen while its being beat senseless I guarantee you are not earning xp very efficiently or effectively. Group's and duo's are the best way to get xp and imo have fun. Mages are a super partner, their abilities complement ours extremely well.</p><br><hr></blockquote><br>The thing some people seem to be missing: With Pet Hold, you can force your pet to not attack, even when it's being hit, so it can regen at sitting speeds while under attack. With a couple HP buffs, or some extra spell regen, this can be more than enough to hold up under a lot of attacks. (Admittedly, it probably couldn't handle 900+ hits or anything insane like that, but if you need to park some trash mob out of the way for a while, this is a great trick.)
