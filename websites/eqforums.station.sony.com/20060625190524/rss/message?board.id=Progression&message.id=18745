    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Here's what I'd like to see as the requirements for progression.&amp;nbsp; My lists are a bit long, and include some easier conent just to make sure folks experience the whole expansion rather than only hitting the main mobs, and ignoring named mobs that don't have essential loot.&amp;nbsp; I realize some of the items are redundant since some mobs are required in order to complete other goals (ex: clearing VP requires Trak anyway).&amp;nbsp; I also think there should be a one week grace period between fulfilling all the requirements for the next expansion and the next expansion actually opening (so people can prepare for the new expansion rush).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To unlock Kunark:&lt;br&gt;Vox, Nagafen&lt;br&gt;Phinny, Estrella&lt;br&gt;CT, Inny&lt;br&gt;Soulfire quest completed&lt;br&gt;Ishva, Allizewsaur, Efreeti Lord, AoF, Frog king, Ancient Cyclops (this line is rather pointless)&lt;br&gt;100 Level 50 characters (really not sure what a reasonable number would be)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Master Yael (I don't recall if the Hole went live before or after Kunark).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To unlock Velious:&lt;br&gt;Gore, Sev, Talendor, Fay&lt;br&gt;Rak`Ashiir, Drusella Sathir&lt;br&gt;Venril Sathir&lt;br&gt;Trakanon&lt;br&gt;Chardok Queen&lt;br&gt;Sky Cleared&lt;br&gt;VP Cleared&lt;br&gt;All Epics Completed&lt;br&gt;100 Level 60 characters (really not sure what a reasonable number would be)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To unlock Luclin :&lt;br&gt;Lodizal&lt;br&gt;Velketor, Lord Bob&lt;br&gt;*Dain&lt;br&gt;*Ring War (10th ring)&lt;br&gt;Shawl quest completed&lt;br&gt;*Tormax, Vindi, AoW (kinda iffy about AoW since only one or two guilds actually killed him before Luclin was released)&lt;br&gt;Wuoshi, Kelorek&lt;br&gt;*Tunare&lt;br&gt;*Yelinak&lt;br&gt;Kland, Sont, Zland&lt;br&gt;Doze (maybe require a tear quest completed as well)&lt;br&gt;Lendi, Gozz, Telk&lt;br&gt;*NToV Cleared (Vulak)&lt;br&gt;*Bristlebane&lt;br&gt;*Sleeper awakened&lt;br&gt;200 Level 60 characters (same number comment as above)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I plan on stop playing before PoP (quick list: Seru, Ssra named, VT, RoF, Burrower/THO, Shei/IV, Greig, Rumble/Doom, ¿AA requirement?).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any comments or input?&amp;nbsp; I've been trying to think of some additional requirements for opening Kunark, but all the Mobs I can think of will for sure will be killed before Inny/CT drop.&amp;nbsp; Possibly some more quests (Temple of Sol Ro quests, Robe of the Lost Circle, jeweled skull...etc.), maybe up to a certain isle in Sky (1-3 or 1-4 cleared).&amp;nbsp; I've also been thinking about some more obscure Velious requirements: maybe some names from dungeon crawl zones (SG mobs, named rats in DN, ToFS cleared) or lesser known quests (ex: The Spirit of Garzicor,&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Ralgyn's Promise)&amp;nbsp; What do you guys want the requirements to be?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Honestly i think the expansions could be unlocked quickly but what would the point of that be?&amp;nbsp; Just race through content killing things with the shortest amount of time possible spent farming gear?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;The expansions should be released semi-like a new game expansion where all bosses should be killed and have some significant time spent farming them for drops.&amp;nbsp; If a guild can kill a boss once then have the next expansion open, unlocking all new items that destroy old items as most expansion items did, all the old content would only be killed once then skipped.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Servers should have a good month+ of leveling 1-50 then a good month or 2 of original plane / the hole / naggy vox farming before kunark is released.&amp;nbsp; Then time spend farming&amp;nbsp; full sets of kunark armor as well as veeshans peak and class epics.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; When velious is released luclin shoudlnt be unlocked until AoW has died because he alone is a major cokblock to progression.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I think the first 2 expansions alone should take around 5-6 months to unlock just becuase there is A LOT of content to be completed there and just because 1 person finishes an epic quest and 1 person gets set armor doesnt mean the entire server is ready for an expansion.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;if you want to wait &lt;font size="3"&gt;as long as possible to unlock luclin&lt;/font&gt; i would say:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;To unlock Kunark:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plane of Sky Cleared&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br&gt;To unlock Velious:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Veeshans Peak Cleared&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;To unlock Luclin :&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;NToV Cleared (Vulak)&lt;/b&gt; or&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt; Sleeper awakened&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I would like to see individualized progression. If you have not personally participated in the event that unlocks the new content, you can't go there until you do. Just because some members of an uber guild rushed through the content and unlocked the next expansion for themselves, does not mean it should then be unlocked for everyone, including their fellow guildies who may not have participated in the unlocking event. You need to keep a certain number of players in the old content for a while to help each other to advance. Once the expansions get unlocked, everyone will abandon the old world in an attempt to unlock the next expansion and so on and so on. If everyone needs a personal flag to get to the new content, then there will always be players in every expansion because they haven't all been flagged for the next level of content yet.</description>

      <description>I can see how that would be nice for casual players who want to level all the way up to 50 in old world zones, since people couldn't flock to Kunark zones right away, but it would also strand a lot of casual players who may want to move on.&amp;nbsp; I can't see how it would work out.&amp;nbsp; Presumably most of the progression requirements will be end game raid mobs, and some people just don't have the time to devote the 6-8 hours required to complete some of the raids.&amp;nbsp; Also, after awhile there will not be a large enough population left in older expansions to coordinate raids.&amp;nbsp; Progressing past Velious would be extremely difficult for some people, because in addition to long raids being required to progress, raids are required to get equipment good enough to complete the progression raids.&amp;nbsp; Every expansion has content for casual players that can be done with 1 group or less, so it seems a bit off to require players only interested in single group content to complete raid content to move on.&amp;nbsp; PoP has individualized progression, and that works, but it's only for raid focused content, and isn't needed to enter the later expansions.&amp;nbsp; Would you propose each character on an account needs to complete the progression, or would completing it with one character flag the whole account.&amp;nbsp; Requiring each character would be a bit annoying, but would also help casual players advance, because advanced players would re-run old raids in order to flag their twinks, and may let others who need flags tag along.&amp;nbsp; Vox/Naggy could still be a pain because of the 52-cap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I don't care what they are so long as they are:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;A) Completely unknown&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;and&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;B) So vast and complex that a single guild can't unlock an expansion on its own.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;(since I'd like a "pre-Luclin" server) Every single quest in the current expansion be completed by 100 different accounts&amp;nbsp;to unlock the next expansion.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But, I know that realisticlly it'll be something that most people will do normally anyways like kill boss mob "x", then boss mob "y" and finally boss mob "z" to unlock the expansions.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;All the bosses go down eventually anyways, looks like they could tie the unlocks to something else.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;All major bosses killed&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;4 months between expansions&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Is what Im looking for. Honestly though I was reading in an interview somewhere and one of the devs said he is betting at the very least a year to unlock all 11 so Im going to bet the requirements are pretty low - as is the time progression between.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I would imagine 2000 different accounts complaining on this forum that the next expansion has not been unlocked yet, will be the key ;)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;At least two months for each expansion.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You're prolly right but i honestly think more people will be complaining about expanions opening too FAST than too slow.. Even the hardcore raiders like me wont be complaining about Too slow.. The more challege the more reward IMO</description>

&lt;P&gt;All major bosses killed&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;4 months between expansions&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Is what Im looking for. Honestly though I was reading in an interview somewhere and one of the devs said he is betting at the very least a year to unlock all 11 so Im going to bet the requirements are pretty low - as is the time progression between.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Just examples i dont have the exact facts of the math nor do i plan on researching it :smileyhappy:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If you go by a timeline.. And say what the Dev said is true.. about a year give or take..&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The game has been out for 7 years.. 11 expansions.. thats about&amp;nbsp; 232 Days per expansion.. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;With this progression server you are talking 33 Days per expansions(Given the dev's statement).. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now i think thats rediculous and that Dev didnt think his statement out very well.. But who knows.. he may very well be right and if thats the case alot of people will be angry and alot of time will be wasted..&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>I'm hoping there will be some more detailed game information prior to going live. &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Since most people seem to want to stay pre luclin/PoP, I would also like a certain amount of time before an expansion can be unlocked. They've stated this is the case, which is good, but I'm hoping a decent amount of time, so that I'm not always trying to play catch up.&amp;nbsp; I'd like to max lvl and have time to do quests or whatever before having to worry about more lvls/aa etc etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
