    <title>How many servers? Overpopulation?</title>
    <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Progression&amp;message.id=1017</link>
    <description>&lt;div&gt;I'm curious on how many servers they will run this on.  I'm seeing old school players sparking interest in this, meaning they're going to need more than just one.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>As 'a server' is actually a server farm of, I think someone once said, 20-30 physical servers, I would hope that in a new server they'd allocate twice as many physical servers to it initially. Then, after 3 or 4 months, do a population audit on the new server and, if the population is the same as any other server, cancel the lease on the extra physical servers and revert the progression server to the standard number of physical servers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or if the population is large enough, they could then do a server split and split off the extra physical servers into the new game server, so you have 2 game servers with a 'normal' number of physical servers, instead of 1 game server with double the normal physical servers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Addstopgo, you've mentioned the pvp teams servers a couple of times now.  It is true the first Team PVP server was flooded and that when they split them their population bottomed out.  However, over the next few months their populations increased significantly again.  I know VZ felt downright crowded several times.  For a pvp server 2000 people was actually a bit more than it needed, and some people left because of overcrowding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The comparison is bad for other reasons too.  Verant did a miserable job with the pvp servers - its absolutely disgusting how poorly VZ and TZ were treated.  If they do the same with the progression server then yes, it will have been a shame to open up more than one at once.  However, it wouldn't require too much thought to make this server a lot of fun. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I agree with your point that servers shouldn't be opened based just on early population, but I don't agree with that particular example at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;From what devs have said there will be only 1 at first as a pilot server.  If enough interest continues with that server they might release newer servers.  A problem that I see with basing population on how many are interested on the boards is that early EQ is quite a bit different than it is now.  There arent nearly as many zones to get exp in which can easily lead to overcrowding at certain levels, and the exp that is available isnt as good as it was with the current expansions. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I've&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Oops, hit the wrong button...anyways...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; I've heard so many people say that the leveling will just fly by because we know tactics and where to level at.  But after a couple servers had come out and people got to level 50 it was already pretty common knowledge.  The problem was that it did take awhile to level which might turn away people after just a small amount of time. &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are a LOT of zones in the old world that can be used by newbies.&amp;nbsp; And clever folks can spot at least a few more beyond them, especially with a group.&amp;nbsp; A partial list of newbie friendly zones (excluding the cities themselves):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paineel newbie area&lt;br&gt;Toxxulia Forest&lt;br&gt;Erud's Crossing&lt;br&gt;North Qeynos&lt;br&gt;Qeynos Aqueducts&lt;br&gt;Qeynos Hills&lt;br&gt;Blackburrow (though pickings will be slim for the &amp;lt;5 crowd)&lt;br&gt;Everfrost&lt;br&gt;Misty Thicket&lt;br&gt;East Commonlands&lt;br&gt;North Ro&lt;br&gt;Innothule Swamp&lt;br&gt;Rathe Mountains&lt;br&gt;Nektulos Forest&lt;br&gt;Ocean of Tears&lt;br&gt;Feerott&lt;br&gt;Forgotten Halls (if JP will be available with the classic world)&lt;br&gt;Butcherblock Mountains&lt;br&gt;Greater Faydark&lt;br&gt;Steamfont Mountains&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And there are several more that open up as soon as you hit 5th level or so.&amp;nbsp; If people can't find a place to hunt opening day then shame on them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Imagine all of those people trying to fit into the tutorial zone.  I think they should up the zone populations of the newbie areas.  I was just fighting in north ro and had a heck of a time having enough to kill when I was the only one there.  The mobs were way too spread out.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;The original north ro seemed to be better for leveling in to me.  most of my alts went through that zone before PoP came out and I quit.  It just seems too big now and they probably didnt increase the amount of spawns there.   Also this experience is from fighting on the grass around the guards and not going into the desert btw.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Oops, hit the wrong button...anyways...&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;I've heard so many people say that the leveling will just fly by because we know tactics and where to level at.&amp;nbsp; But after a couple servers had come out and people got to level 50 it was already pretty common knowledge.&amp;nbsp; The problem was that it did take awhile to level which might turn away people after just a small amount of time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Those who think leveling will fly by don't remember the old days. I don't think many people realize how long it will take to level iwth Fine steel weapons and bronze armor. BA ftw!</description>
