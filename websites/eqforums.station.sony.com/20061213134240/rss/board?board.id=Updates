      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;*** NPCS ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Added level 10 to 25 spell and melee tome merchants to Crescent Reach near the Master's Hall.&lt;br&gt;- Artisan Moswin decided that she disliked being confused for the bakers assistant Moswen. She has decided to go by her other name Irisi. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Quests ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Scout Zryan will no longer award the final item awards for his mission arc after each mission in the arc. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;- Wanderlust Guild: Crypt Delving no longer requires you to enter the Shade King's chambers.&lt;br&gt;- In Icefall the Nightmoon and Coldeye clans will be more pleased with you than they were before if you kill their enemies. However, the quest givers for these two clans will not deal with you unless you are at least tolerated among the clan itself.&lt;br&gt;- Nerissa Clothspinner has realized that she will need money to continue the search for her sister. She will now continue to sell her wares when she is on the move.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Tradeskills ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Yew Leaves now look like leaves.&lt;br&gt;- Some secrets to making the single unfired tradeskill charms have gotten out and they are now easier to make. The unfired artisan charm and the firing of the charms is still a difficult process.&lt;br&gt;- Some spell research items and a few poison making items stack better.&lt;br&gt;- Acids used in spell research are now sold by NPC vendors. These vendors do not like handling such items so they charge a hefty premium for carrying them.&amp;nbsp; You will save money making them yourself, but you can save time by buying them.&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a misspelling in the spell recipe for Elemental Simulacrum.&lt;br&gt;- Made changes to the following list of spell recipes to more closely match the systematic spell research system. If you already learned to make these spells your recipe book will automatically update to match.&amp;nbsp; The Spells changed are: Feral Form, Virtue, Hand of Virtue, Maelstrom of Ro, Rathe's Son, Elemental Siphon, Elemental Simulacrum, Symbol of Kazad, Flameshield of Ro, Ward of Xegony, Servant of Marr, Xegony's Phantasmal Guard, Kazad`s Mark, Armor of the Zealot, Cry of Thunder, Star Scream, Faith, Pacification, Ward of Nife, Pious Might, Aura of the Crusader, Cloak of Luclin, Crusader's Purity, Serene Command, Placate, Zevfeer's Bite and Touch of the Devourer.&lt;br&gt;- The task "Thundercrest Expedition" for Dwarven grandmaster cultural charms now requires the correct item in the second stage (Stone Necklace).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** AAs ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- AA experience now mimics the way leveling experience splits within a group made up of players of very different levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Missions ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- If you are in the death limbo state (hover mode) when the mission completes and the rewards are granted, you will now get your reward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Combat ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- If you logout with an active combat timer, when you login again you will now see the correct timer.&lt;br&gt;- Bolt spells and ranged weapons should no longer fire straight up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Miscellaneous ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Corrected a problem that was causing some beneficial melee disciplines to not show up in the buff windows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The EverQuest Team &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>September 19th, 2006&lt;br&gt;_____________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Highlights ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to EverQuest: The Serpent's Spine, the 12th expansion for EverQuest!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- New Player Race: The Drakkin have been created from both human and dragon blood to protect the future of all dragon kind. Several colors and customizations will be available to make each Drakkin character unique, such as elegant scale markings and horns.&lt;br&gt;- Level Cap Increase: Players can now reach level 75, complete with new spells, abilities, raids and quests for greater power. &lt;br&gt;- Content for Levels 1 to 75: Play through every level of the game without ever leaving the Serpent Spine Mountains. The entrance to Serpent's Spine can be found within Highpass Hold.&lt;br&gt;- New Starting City: Crescent Reach is a fully functioning city with all that is required to learn and thrive in EverQuest, including merchant, quest, combat and tradeskill areas. All classes and races are welcome within the city.&lt;br&gt;- Dynamic Features: New zones, NPCs, destructible and interactive objects.&lt;br&gt;- New AAs &amp;amp; Spells: Experience new spells and Alternative Advancement abilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spell Ranks: The new spells that you can acquire in The Serpent's Spine have different ranks to them. The higher ranks of a spell are generally more powerful and more difficult to obtain than the lower ranks. When you scribe a higher rank of a spell that you already know, the lower rank will automatically be overwritten by the higher rank and your spell casting gems and hotkeys will be updated to reflect that you now have a higher rank of the spell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** General Game Improvements ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** AA System ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The AA system has undergone some significant back-end changes. The experience you get toward an AA point is now based on the difficulty of the NPC relative to you rather than being based directly on the NPCs level. This means that you will gain a similar amount of experience killing even con creatures at all levels. The amount of experience required to gain an AA is based off the current amount required for a level 70 character to do so, so players at level 70 shouldn't see much of a difference. Players below level 70 will gain AA experience at a rate faster than they were before since they are now gaining it at a similar rate as the level 70. Going forward, this rate will remain static so the amount of kills to gain an AA point at level 75 will be the same it is at level 70. Current abilities and points spent are not affected by this change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Death ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We've made a change to the way death works. When you die now you will be "hovering" over your body and can choose to stay that way while waiting for a resurrection instead of immediately zoning to your bind point. This is being done to help players on slow connections who take a big hit from having to zone twice when they die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Character Creation ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We've changed character creation to make it more graphical, allow characters to be created from a single page, and updated it to include features associated with the new Drakkin race. As part of this, we've set up some character defaults so starting point allocation, starting city, and starting deity all have defaults now, which can be changed if you wish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Con Color Changes ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have introduced a new con color, dark blue, which represents a range of blue con NPCs that give a bonus to their experience due to being very close to your level, generally within 5 levels. The concept of a dark blue con NPC has existed in EQ for a while now, but we've decided to change the con system to visually include this range so you can visually see when an NPC falls into this "sweet spot". To properly display a different shade of blue, we've had to reorder the cons a little bit.&amp;nbsp; From trivial to highest con, the colors are now:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Gray - This creature is trivial to you and will give you no experience for killing it.&lt;br&gt;- Green - This creature is not much of a threat, but will still give you some experience.&lt;br&gt;- Blue - This creature is below your level, but high enough level to give you experience.&lt;br&gt;- Dark Blue - This creature is below your level, but close enough to provide a solid challenge and gives you more experience than normal blue cons.&lt;br&gt;- White - This creature is the same level as you&lt;br&gt;- Yellow - This creature is slightly above your level.&lt;br&gt;- Red - This creature is well above your level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition, yellow con now extends up to 3 levels above the player for high end NPCs to help casters determine what can be affected by their spells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Downtime ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As EverQuest has grown over the years, the amount of downtime imposed upon players has grown as well and we'd rather players find challenge in the fights themselves than in the time between them. Toward that end, we've created a new system that is simple to use, but powerful and flexible enough to control downtime as the game continues to grow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The basics of the new system are simple. Once you have been out-of-combat for a sufficient amount of time, you can sit down (or be on a non-moving horse) and begin to rest. While resting, you enter an accelerated regeneration state that will quickly recover your mana, health, and endurance. For most single group content, once you are out of combat for 30 seconds you can rest. While dealing with multi-group content, that time is 5 minutes. The amount of time you have to be out-of-combat before you can rest varies for group content and raid content due to the different needs of the different encounter types.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are a series of icons that will display by your character's name to let you know what your character's current state is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Crossed Swords - You are currently in combat.&lt;br&gt;- Hour Glass - You are recovering from combat and cannot rest yet. In addition to the hourglass, there is a timer bar beneath the endurance bar that will count down as you get closer to being rested.&lt;br&gt;- Poison Drop - You are no longer in combat, but cannot rest because of a debuff that is affecting you. You must get rid of the debuff before you can rest. Certain debuffs now have a yellow border instead of a red one. These debuffs do not affect your ability to rest.&lt;br&gt;- Void - The void is the default icon and indicates that you are not in-combat and you can rest at any time.&lt;br&gt;- Energy Swirl - The energy swirl indicates that you are currently resting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Group Mentoring ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Players can now share their group leadership experience with another member of their group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Reward Window ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tasks within The Serpent's Spine have a new way of giving out rewards. When there are multiple rewards to choose from, you will get to choose which one you like from a selection window. If you donâ€™t choose a reward immediately, you can bring up the window later to make the selection but you can only have a maximum of 5 outstanding rewards at any time. If you go above that, the oldest reward will be replaced and you will be unable to claim that reward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** NPCs ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Corrected a couple of problems in the NPC call-for-help code. NPCs will now call for help immediately when attacked regardless of when they were last aggroed if they are no longer aggro. Also, NPCs will now properly aggro on the owner of a pet if the pet is sent to attack the NPC.&lt;br&gt;- Shrewd halfling bankers have set up shop in the guild lobby.&lt;br&gt;- Coldwind in Nektulos will now offer a confirmation box to players when they try to remove their Curse of the Blood AAs.&lt;br&gt;- Various issues with the Trial of Lashing in Plane of Justice have been resolved.&lt;br&gt;- The balances in the Kvxe Pirik event in Tacvi will once again reset to full health between waves. &lt;br&gt;- The Alchemy vendors have set up shop in Innothule, Everfrost, West Cabilis, and Shar Vahl.&lt;br&gt;- A new vendor has appeared in East Cabilis that caries some basic adventuring supplies.&lt;br&gt;- Tani N`mar and Founy Jestands are now pick-pocketable again.&lt;br&gt;- The skeletons summoned by the Swarm of Decay ability are casting their spells properly again. &lt;br&gt;- Tegea Prendyn has grown tired of her ocean view and now rests near an inn.&lt;br&gt;- Char and Blaze in the ROTA raid now have their spells functioning correctly again.&lt;br&gt;- Many healer NPCs in Depths of Darkhollow now require some casting time to get off their big heal.&lt;br&gt;- The Vengeful skeletons in Everfrost should no longer evade the guards quite so well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Tradeskill ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Made the Foldable Reinforced Medicine Bag a bit roomier.&lt;br&gt;- For clarity, the tradeskill trophies and carry-alls now list the lore group they are part of.&lt;br&gt;- The yield when making metal bits has increased to 2.&lt;br&gt;- Modified the recipe for Blessing of Reverence to make the spell line more consistent.&lt;br&gt;- Lost Dungeons of Norrath and Omens of Wars spells have become tradable. Additionally, Lost Dungeons of Norrath spells will have no token sellback value to NPCs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Spells ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Stun-caps have been added to the various levels of the Strike of Opportunity spells. &lt;br&gt;- The Circle of Power aura effects will now improve all melee and ranged attacks instead of affecting only one-hand blunt.&lt;br&gt;- Wolf form illusions will no longer automatically make you KOS to guards.&lt;br&gt;- Illusion: Tree now uses a different, global tree model rather than the tree model it used to use, which was only available in older zones.&lt;br&gt;- The damage dealt by high level NPCs that have been charmed has been increased.&lt;br&gt;- Increased the regeneration of pets while they are out-of-combat to keep pace with the increases of out-of-combat regeneration for PCs.&lt;br&gt;- Translocate spells no longer require a reagent.&lt;br&gt;- The reuse on the warrior disciplines Bazu Bellow and Mock are no longer linked together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** AAs ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Most beneficial AA effects that last for less than 30 seconds will now go to the short duration buff window instead of the normal buff window.&lt;br&gt;- Improved Harm Touch and Leech Touch are now on different timers.&lt;br&gt;- The Shadowknight AAs Consumption of the Soul and Improved Consumption of the Soul now provide a greater increase to Leech Curse.&lt;br&gt;- Refunded all AAs that increased your chance to channel through damage. Channeling is currently set to 100% for all classes due to a long standing issue in how it is calculated, so the abilities weren't doing anything. This includes Channeling Focus, Channeling Mastery, and Internal Metronome. Item Channeling abilities, such as Concentration, are not affected.&lt;br&gt;- You will now get a message if you have the Stonewall or Willful Death AA and successfully feign death through a spell that hit you.&lt;br&gt;- Lowered the reuse time on the Monk AA Imitate Death to 18 minutes. Modified Hastened Death to reduce the reuse by 2 more minutes per rank of the ability.&lt;br&gt;- Increased the mitigation of the higher ranks of the bard AA Shield of Notes.&lt;br&gt;- By popular demand, removed Spell Casting Subtlety from the Bard AA lineup. Any points spent in that ability will be refunded.&lt;br&gt;- The Beastlord AA Feral Swipe has received a damage increase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Skills ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Modified skill progression for many classes.&lt;br&gt;- Bards and Beastlords now have access to Double Attack starting at level 71.&lt;br&gt;- All bard instrument skills are now available starting at level 5.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Veteran Rewards ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Issues with the Steadfast Servant casting lower level effects at certain level ranges have been corrected. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Events ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The Aura of Destruction from Uqua and Prick of a Poisoned Pin from Demi-Plane of Blood will land reliably again and last their intended duration.&lt;br&gt;- Slightly reduced the hit-points of the third wave adds in the Sendaii event.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Items ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Changed the name of the "Stromguard Forge" to "Stormguard Forge".&lt;br&gt;- Many items that had extremely strong light sources have had their light sources reduced a bit to help with the issues where lightly colored surfaces become blindingly bright.&lt;br&gt;- Many spell reagents now stack to 100 instead of 20.&lt;br&gt;- Some items now have a new tab on them called "Lore" that will give extended information about the item.&lt;br&gt;- Shield of the Immaculate, Amulet of Necropotence, and Holgresh Elder Beads are now flagged all/all.&lt;br&gt;- Upgraded Stats on Class Specific Items in Demiplane of Blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Disciplines ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- You may now learn combat abilities by right-clicking upon the Tomes instead of delivering them to your guild master.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Miscellaneous ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Race based experience penalties have been removed.&lt;br&gt;- You can you enable texture streaming from the advanced graphics options window.&amp;nbsp; This should reduce the total memory used by the client during any given play session.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The EverQuest Team &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a crash while trying to search the bazaar when not using the default UI.&lt;br&gt;- Fixed the problem with AA experience being reset when you enter monster missions or use a shroud.&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a bug with some tasks not being available to be given out to players.&lt;br&gt;- The â€˜;â€™ chat commands should now work again.&lt;br&gt;- Setting a chat window's default channel to a chat channel (instead of say, group, raid, ...) will now broadcast the chat to that channel.&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a problem that was causing the Concentration AA to not function properly.&lt;br&gt;- We've reverted the fix to channeling made with the last patch. After much discussion, our general feeling is that channeling has been broken for long enough that players have come to rely on that broken behavior as expected gameplay. For the time being, we've reverted back to that broken behavior and will address spell interrupts in general at a later date.&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;*** Headlines ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** We've now upgraded to DirectX 9.0c! ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Continuing our efforts to keep pace with current technology, EverQuest will be upgrading to DirectX9.0c to allow us to take &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;advantage of many of the new features and fixes since our last upgrade in the middle of 2003.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; You will need to be sure that &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;you are currently running DirectX9.0C .&amp;nbsp; If not you will need to download it.&amp;nbsp; This can be done by simply going to &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=56513&amp;amp;clcid=0x409 and following the instructions there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Make sure you:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align="left"&gt;1. Get the April 2006 DirectX 9.0C redistributable version (Caution: Download is about 52 MB) at: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=fb73d860-5af1-45e5-bac0-9bc7a5254203&amp;amp;DisplayLang=en&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Run directx_apr2006_redist.exe. Extract the files to an easily identifiable directory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Go to the directory the files were extracted to in step 2. Run "DXSETUP.EXE" from that directory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. Accept the license agreement. Allow the installer to update the DirectX components.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Nektulos Forest got a face lift!&amp;nbsp; Check out the amazing new look.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The Guild Lobby is now available to everyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The 8th-year veteran reward Throne of Heroes, a gate ability that transports veterans to the throne room in the guild lobby, is now available to those who are eligible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*- The map window now has an option to display your group mates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- To help smooth the transition to incurring death penalties for new players (losing experience and leaving a corpse), the level when you start to incur death penalties has been lowered from level 11 to level 6 and the amount of experience you lose when you die now starts at a very small amount at level 6 and slowly ramps up from there.&amp;nbsp; We've added a corpse summoner to the tutorial who will summon corpses for free for anyone who is level 10 or under. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- New Hot Zones! With this patch the old hot zones have been reverted to their previous values and a new set of hot zones has been selected! The following zones are now the "Hot Zones"! &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Level 20: Swamp of No Hope&lt;br&gt;Level 25: Overthere&lt;br&gt;Level 30: Timorous Deep&lt;br&gt;Level 35: Emerald Jungle&lt;br&gt;Level 40: Dreadlands&lt;br&gt;Level 45: City of Mist&lt;br&gt;Level 50: Skyfire&lt;br&gt;Level 55: Karnor's Castle&lt;br&gt;Level 60: Veksar &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;*** Requested during Fan Faire ***&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;(Items in body are denoted with a *)&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;*- The map window now has an option to display your group mates.&lt;br&gt;*- Pet spells and weapon procs now report to the owner and can be filtered appropriately.&lt;br&gt;*- The refresh time on Spirit of Bih`Li has been reduced.&lt;br&gt;*- The damage on Bloodpyre and Heartblaze have been increased.&lt;br&gt;*- Illusion: Werewolf now uses the new werewolf model.&amp;nbsp; This applies to enchanter spells and item effects.&lt;br&gt;*- You can now turn off messages generated by bard songs affecting your pet.&lt;br&gt;*- Throwing axes should now pull from ammo/inventory appropriately.&lt;br&gt;*- Increased the amount of mobs that can drop exceptional shissar blood.&lt;br&gt;*- The tradeskill recipes for Dreary Deeds and Infusion of Spirit have finally been discovered. &lt;br&gt;*- The Antonican forge has moved to outside of Armor by Ikthar.&lt;br&gt;*- The LDoN raids have been switched over to use the expedition system. This means you can add new players to the raid at any time, and the lockout occurs at the end after a success instead of at the beginning when the raid is launched. Also, the maximum player limit has been increased from 36 to 54, and all death count failure mechanics have been removed.&lt;br&gt;*- Dain`s Historian Duggans will now review with you which of his missions you have completed and turned in a seal for that mission. Simply ask him to "Review" the Coldain History you have studied.&lt;br&gt;*- Updated the character models for many NPCs throughout the world.&amp;nbsp; This includes changing Illusion: Werewolf to use the new werewolf model.&lt;br&gt;*- Creatures without legs have lost the ability to kick. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*- Lowered the hit points and increased the respawn time of the door that leads from Devastation into Stronghold of Rage to make access to Stronghold of Rage easier.&lt;br&gt;*- The default size for the barter and bazaar windows has been increased.&lt;br&gt;*- You can now filter the barter window by seller name.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Spells ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Fire pets should now regenerate mana appropriately.&lt;br&gt;*- Pet spells and weapon procs now report to the owner and can be filtered appropriately.&lt;br&gt;*- The refresh time on Spirit of Bih`Li has been reduced.&lt;br&gt;*- The damage on Bloodpyre and Heartblaze have been increased.&lt;br&gt;- The effect from your aura will no longer be removed if you use an illusion.&lt;br&gt;- Having an aura up should no longer cause targeting issues while you are under illusions.&lt;br&gt;*- Illusion: Werewolf now uses the new werewolf model.&amp;nbsp; This applies to enchanter spells and item effects.&lt;br&gt;- Bard songs will now stop pulsing when an NPC forces the bard to feign death.&lt;br&gt;*- You can now turn off messages generated by bard songs affecting your pet.&lt;br&gt;- Buffs that increase run speed will no longer overwrite AA run speed increases that are better than the buff.&lt;br&gt;- You can now specify beneficial spells to block by name using the Blocked Buff window.&amp;nbsp; This will allow you to block spells that don't have a buff icon without editing a file.&lt;br&gt;- Attempting to gate or teleport to a zone that isn't currently running will no longer result in your spell bar being locked up.&lt;br&gt;- Several spell texts which were gender-specific have been changed to something more gender-neutral.&lt;br&gt;- Added a wear-off message to Elddar's Grasp, Puratus, Harmony of Nature, and Mind Shatter.&lt;br&gt;- Short duration buff icons should now be a consistent size.&lt;br&gt;- Eyes of Zomm have been sedated and should no longer decide to attack their owners from time to time.&lt;br&gt;- Sitting while levitation wears off will no longer leave your character looking like he's falling until you stand up again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** AAS ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Added the 8-year veteran reward Throne of Heroes, a gate ability that transports veterans to throne room in the guild lobby.&lt;br&gt;- Pious Supplication has been renamed to Improved Hand of Piety.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Items ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Increased the amount of experience that evolving items gain when you kill an NPC. In addition, you will now gain more experience toward your evolving item when you are in a group, similar to how normal experience works. &lt;br&gt;- Reduced the amount of experience required to level up intelligent items. If your items now have more experience than is required to level, they will evolve the next time they gain experience.&lt;br&gt;- Due to the changes to how fast you gain item XP, the amount of XP required to evolve the Cloak of the Spirit Tracker has been increased.&lt;br&gt;- Evolving an item should no longer cause occasional crashes.&lt;br&gt;- The aura effects from Prophecy of Ro "clicky" items are no longer restricted to only hitting your group. In addition, they will no longer recast their effect every 6 seconds, but instead will remain on a character for as long as they are within range of the aura.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*- Throwing axes should now pull from ammo/inventory appropriately.&lt;br&gt;- Lowered the duration on the spin stun on Peace of the Disciple Strike and One Hundred Blows while in PvP.&lt;br&gt;- Bane of Muram and Curse of Muram now last 18 and 36 seconds respectively.&lt;br&gt;-Modified the Battleworn Symbol of Rage. The charm was calculating values higher than intended and now should be on par with other Demiplane of Blood level charms.&lt;br&gt;- Changed all four of the Furious Bash Augments from DoD that use Ambleshift's Amazing Automated Amalgamator to Improved Block. Additionally the names of the Chronal, Discordant and Bazu seals have been changed appropriately.&lt;br&gt;- Altered the Favorable Breezes line of augments from DoD that use Ambleshift's Amazing Automated Amalgamator. They now give a different progression of effect.&lt;br&gt;- Increased the level required to equip the following augments to 45 to match the level that their effect is able to be used: Carnivorous Coral, Deepwood Hunter's Stone.&lt;br&gt;- Increased the level required to equip the following augments to 60 to match the level that their effect is able to be used: Green Fire Phosphorous, Frozen Malachite, Jagged Dragon Scale, Turquoise Lifetap Sieve.&lt;br&gt;- Increased the level required to use the following augments to 65 to match the level that their effect is able to be used: Volcanic Sink Geode, Deep Crust Frozen Malachite, Vein Sap Mineral, Ethereal Sky Stone, Faerie Luck Stone.&lt;br&gt;- The Mystical Aptitude effect will now last its full 20 minutes.&lt;br&gt;- Vibrating Gauntlets of Infuse and Vibrating Hammer of Infuse are now lore to each other.&amp;nbsp; This is to prevent players from getting into an odd state that could cause a crash.&lt;br&gt;- Barbarians can now use Naturalist's Leather Arm Wraps.&lt;br&gt;- Roleplayer's Jester now looks like a doll rather than a bag.&lt;br&gt;- The Burning Affliction focus effect on The Skull of Torture should now work properly.&lt;br&gt;- Increased the stats on the Wrought Blade of Hiz.&lt;br&gt;- Bravefoot Short Sword is now considered a one-handed slashing weapon instead of one-handed blunt.&lt;br&gt;- The Cracked Stone of Savagery now has the proc effect of Lifesap I. &lt;br&gt;- The Shard of Crystallized Rage now has the proc effect of Fiery Strike II. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Skills ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Made changes to the taunt formula at high levels. A level 60 character taunting an even con or higher level NPC will now use the character's taunt skill to determine success rate, similar to what occurs below level 60. The chance to taunt is roughly the same. In addition, the reduction in your chance to taunt creatures higher level than yourself now occurs at a slower rate and the minimum chance to taunt an NPC is higher. Also, you will now gain a bonus to your chance to taunt NPCs that are lower level than yourself. To go along with the change to use a character's taunt skill after level 60, paladins and shadowknights have had their taunt caps increased to match warriors and ranger's skill cap has been increased to 200. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;- Taunts that fail because of distance will no longer cause you to have to wait the cool down period before attempting to taunt again.&lt;br&gt;- Ranged combat should behave much more consistently now.&lt;br&gt;- Increased the sense and disarm range on many traps throughout the world.&lt;br&gt;- /con will now properly report whether an NPC can see you sneaky rogues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Tradeskills ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*- Increased the amount of mobs that can drop exceptional shissar blood.&lt;br&gt;*- The tradeskill recipes for Dreary Deeds and Infusion of Spirit have finally been discovered. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;- Merchants across the world realized that they were selling small pieces of ore at a loss. They have mutually agreed on a price increase. &lt;br&gt;- The poisons from the Omens of War era will no longer magically create a vial; they now require two of the appropriate poison vial. &lt;br&gt;- You will no longer be able to combine ingredients that you have up for sale in the bazaar.&lt;br&gt;*- The Antonican forge has moved to outside of Armor by Ikthar.&lt;br&gt;- Failing to create Frost Bunny Stew will now return your pot to you.&lt;br&gt;- Fixed the bug to the evolution of the tradeskill trophies for players using lower than master certificates while having a 300 skill.&lt;br&gt;- Bristlebane's Challenge and Bristlebane's Challenge Meats have changed to No Drop. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a bug in the wording of the Grandmaster's Book of Barbarian Culture.&lt;br&gt;- Expanded the shark skins that can be used to make advanced poison vials. There are two shark skin items, both with the same name.&lt;br&gt;- Seeping Haze poisons will now properly bestow the Seeping Haze proc effect. &lt;br&gt;- Bitter feedback poisons will not properly bestow the Bitter Feedback proc effect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Quests ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Removed the "Loot 4" requirement from all of the "Bring Me Their Heads" quests in Devastation and Stronghold of Rage. This should make these quests more accessible by allowing characters to collect the items needed, then get the quest and hand them in to complete it. &lt;br&gt;- Added an experience reward for the "Bring Me Their Heads" and "Engines of Destruction" tasks in the Devastation and Stronghold of Rage.&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a problem with the Shaman epic 2.0 Elder Spirit of Enlightenment in West Freeport.&amp;nbsp; Seemed he wanted to enlighten himself by wandering where he shouldn't. He should now happily lead shamans from the Jade Tiger Inn into the courtyard for the ritual.&lt;br&gt;- The drop rate of the Twilight Sea armor quest gems has been increased significantly. In an effort to keep the amount of money entering the world from those gems roughly the same, the value of the gems has been reduced as a result.&lt;br&gt;- Shalowen the Pure will now return The Chalice of Life if you have completed the single group missions in his arc in order and turning in the chalice of life drop from the Corruption of Ro raid.&lt;br&gt;- Exploring the Valley of Xanzerok for the Arcstone quests should now work correctly when levitating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Events ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*- The LDoN raids have been switched over to use the expedition system. This means you can add new players to the raid at any time, and the lockout occurs at the end after a success instead of at the beginning when the raid is launched. Also, the maximum player limit has been increased from 36 to 54, and all death count failure mechanics have been removed.&lt;br&gt;- The events in Deathknell, Tower of Dissonance now have individual lockout timers instead of applying a lockout to the entire zone. &lt;br&gt;- Made some tuning changes to the first raid event in Deathknell.&lt;br&gt;- The Deathknell Enforcers will no longer use Immobilizing Stone. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;- Added a tether to Maestro Tan`Lor in Theater of Blood.&lt;br&gt;- The lava spout traps have been removed from the Tirranun encounter. &lt;br&gt;- The traps in the Inktu`ta raid should fire off much less often, as well as be easier to locate and disarm. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;- Mayong will now teleport back to his spawn point if he wanders too far from his room. &lt;br&gt;- Fixed a crash bug that could occur in the Demi-Plane of Blood during the Performer event. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;- Drekish the Enforcer of Ro will now properly reset in the event of a failure in the Corruption of Ro raid. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;- You now only need one flagged player to initiate the 18-man Kunark Monster Mission raid: Fall of an Empire. &lt;br&gt;- The invaders that breach the walls into the Stronghold of Rage will be a bit less easy to split. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Missions&amp;nbsp; ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Increased the distance that the Dwarf armies must be from basecamp in The Defense of Thurgadin monster mission before they return to full combat potential. Units moving to forward locations are guaranteed to be back in combat states when they reach their destinations but may still be thinking of resting while they are in transit. &lt;br&gt;*- Dain`s Historian Duggans will now review with you which of his missions you have completed and turned in a seal for that mission. Simply ask him to "Review" the Coldain History you have studied.&lt;br&gt;- Corrected an issue that could cause you to not get credit for finishing the mission "Train" if you were charmed when it completed.&lt;br&gt;- Corrected an issue that could cause the mission "Creepy Concerto" to not update properly if there were pets or auras in the mission. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Zones ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The Guild Lobby is now available to everyone, whether they own Dragons of Norrath or not.&lt;br&gt;- Added a guild hall port stone to Arcstone.&lt;br&gt;- Added an Augment Sealer Pool to Arcstone.&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a number of crashes that could occur with older graphics cards in Anguish and Muramite Proving Grounds.&lt;br&gt;- The portal out of Veeshan's Peak will now take you to the proper version of Freeport.&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a problem that was causing NPCs to fall under the world in Dawnshroud Peaks.&lt;br&gt;- Creatures in Devastation now travel in smaller packs and are slightly weaker than before.&lt;br&gt;- The portal to Dranik's Scar from East Freeport has a visual effect again.&lt;br&gt;- The entrances to Paineel and The Hole can be lock picked once again.&lt;br&gt;- The Hunter/Forager cycle in Trakanon's Teeth should no longer spawn multiple copies of the same creatures.&lt;br&gt;- Corrected an issue that could cause several non-targetable creatures to attack you in Halls of Honor.&lt;br&gt;- Casting Succor in Grimling Forest will no longer put you under the world.&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a problem with the Guild Hall Portal that could cause the teleport confirmation window to display the incorrect target zone.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;- Fixed an issue in Illsalin that was causing groups of arena combatants not to despawn after the event.&lt;br&gt;- You should no longer get stuck behind the grate leading into Dranik Sewers.&lt;br&gt;- Kerra Ridge should now be much friendlier to lower level adventurers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** NPCs ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*- Updated the character models for many NPCs throughout the world.&amp;nbsp; This includes changing Illusion: Werewolf to use the new werewolf model.&lt;br&gt;- The corpse summoners in the guild lobby are no longer fooled by shrouding down to lower levels before handing in a soul stone. &lt;br&gt;*- Creatures without legs have lost the ability to kick. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;- The treants in Theater of Blood that have been shedding hooves and horse meat will no longer do so.&lt;br&gt;*- Lowered the hit points and increased the respawn time of the door that leads from Devastation into Stronghold of Rage to make access to Stronghold of Rage easier.&lt;br&gt;- The angry and hurt Faydedar that Dolgin helps people bait no longer has any viable meat on him.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;-Terrorantula's children should no longer warp across the desert.&lt;br&gt;- Summoning a horse should no longer upset nearby NPCs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Maps ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Cartographers have been very busy.

Monsters rejoice!&lt;br&gt;- The Universal Chat system will replace the old Channel Server for all channel operations. All player-owned channels will be moved over automatically and using channels in the new system is the same as before, so you should not notice any difference.&amp;nbsp; One of the primary benefits of this change is that channels now support cross-server and cross-game functionality. EQIM will no longer work with this change however we do intend to remedy this situation if possible in the future.&lt;br&gt;- Luclin character models are now available to everyone, whether they own Shadows of Luclin or not.&lt;br&gt;- Increased the amount of experience you gain toward your shroud progression when you kill an NPC as a shroud. In addition, you will now gain more experience toward your evolving item when you are in a group, similar to how normal experience works.&amp;nbsp; This does not affect the evolving tradeskill trophies, which don't gain experience from killing creatures.&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a number of rendering anomalies that could occur throughout the game.&lt;br&gt;- Targeting corpses should now be much easier and much less confusing.&lt;br&gt;- Item links can now be sent across Universal Chat channels!&lt;br&gt;- Ogre females using voice emotes for Agree and Disagree will now play the proper voices.&lt;br&gt;- Player and NPC names should now be rendering correctly at all times when they are overlapping.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The EverQuest Team&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Kytherea on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;06-14-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;05:17 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

This should prevent lag from making you go in a loop.&lt;BR&gt;- There is now an augmentation sealer at the Wayfarer camp in Lavastorm.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;- The fungus farm in Kaladim has been re-cultivated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Player Characters ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- The AC cap and the returns over the cap for rangers and berserkers has been slightly increased.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** AAs ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Refunded Spell Casting Deftness AA to Enchanters. SCD was being overwritten by Quick Buff (a similar AA with superior benefits).&lt;BR&gt;- Reduced the reuse time on all the veteran rewards by 4 hours.&lt;BR&gt;- The stacking issues related to Gift of Mana and Abundant Healing have been resolved. Abundant Healing is once again available to purchase for healing classes and should now work properly if you also have Gift of Mana. You cannot proc both of them with one spell, but should see both of them procing now.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Items ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Fazzleâ€™s Map of East Wastes will no longer disappear from your inventory if you log out.&lt;BR&gt;- Altered many of the PoR Jewelry.&amp;nbsp; This change was to fix No Drop Items that should have been Attunable, and to fix some statistics inconsistencies. Also, the HP/MANA gained were balanced with some recommended and required levels if the gain is 50 or greater. In some cases this resulted in greater restrictions, in others it actually reduced the restrictions.&lt;BR&gt;- Modified the Tribute and Guild Tribute values of several items that were either Attunable or NoDrop.&lt;BR&gt;- Changed the Tradeskill flag on a few more items.&lt;BR&gt;- The Fabled Baton of Flame now is now 27 damage, and +1 damage to fire, 18 delay.&lt;BR&gt;- The Fabled Flute of the Sacred Glade now has a 3.2 modifier to wind instruments.&lt;BR&gt;- The Fabled Shawl of Perception now has spell shielding and dot shielding instead of combat effects and accuracy.&lt;BR&gt;- Certain Fabled items have their AC increased.&lt;BR&gt;- Changed the Tanned Hides that were brought to my attention that had an abnormally high merchant greed setting to a more reasonable merchant greed setting.&lt;BR&gt;- Reduced the drop rate of the Sisterâ€™s Opulent Backstabber.&lt;BR&gt;- Increased the drop rate of the Spiroc Wingblade in Plane of Sky.&lt;BR&gt;- Modified the drop rate of plate, chain, leather, and silk on Rikkukin and Kessdona to better reflect the number of classes that can use the items.&lt;BR&gt;- Caerlyna will now trade an Ethereal Satchel of Gathering for an Ethereal Satchel of Gathering Token and vise versa.&lt;BR&gt;- Fixed many bag tokens that were stating the incorrect size for their appropriate bag.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Spells ***&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;- Several Prophecy of Ro NPC spells have been modified to be somewhat less annoying, like Resonating Screech, Howling, Grappling Roots, Thorny Vines, Sageâ€™s Curse, and Shimmering Silence Dust.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;- Fixed an exploit with the buff blocking feature.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Line of Sight ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Line of Sight issues that were introduced with the last update should now be resolved.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Guilds ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Newly formed guilds will now be able to get into their guild halls.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;-- The EverQuest Team&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;EverQuest Live Update - 03/15/06&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;*** Anniversary Events ***&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;- Double experience!&amp;nbsp; To kick off the celebration, from 12:00 PM Pacific Time on March 16th until 12:00 PM Pacific Time on March 20th all normal experience rewards will be doubled!&lt;BR&gt;- Fabled NPCs have returned! Many of your favorite NPCs from the original EverQuest zones and Kunark have been upgraded to Fabled versions that are tougher and tote better loot.&amp;nbsp; And for the first time, they are joined by over a hundred NPCs from Velious!&lt;BR&gt;- New scavenger hunt! NPCs in Thurgadin, Kael, and Skyshrine are looking for help finishing up some of their collections.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*** Missions, Quests &amp;amp; Events ***&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;- Fixed a bug in the Gilded Scroll mission that was not updating the scrolls when they are looted.&lt;BR&gt;- Five new unusual creatures have been spotted in the Demi-Plane of Blood. &lt;BR&gt;- The mini bosses in Anguish will now drop augments again.&lt;BR&gt;- Made some aesthetic changes to the Snowtail and Ghost encounters in Razorthorne.&lt;BR&gt;- Tailfang in Shar Vahl will now drop his tail on the Firiona Vie server.&lt;BR&gt;- The mission The Key to the Past should now hand out an appropriate reward.&lt;BR&gt;- Reduced the difficulty of the Oroshar encounter in Arcstone.&amp;nbsp; Oroshar should now be in line with the other four spirits. &lt;BR&gt;- Modified the Sundersky encounter in Arcstone.&amp;nbsp; Sundersky is now more powerful, but becomes less so after his four summoned winds are destroyed. &lt;BR&gt;- Collapsed all of the missions on Spirit Hunter Elijo into one mission: Mark of the Spirits.&amp;nbsp; Any previously collected spirit marks can still be turned into Spirit Hunter Elijo for task credit.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Ao the Fourth Born now gives out a spell scroll reward for completing his mission arc.&amp;nbsp; If you've previously completed all 3 Skylance Missions, then simply hail Ao for your reward.&lt;BR&gt;- For the quest, Through the Portal, a fix has been made so that crazed scyrkins will drop the needed shards.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*** AAs , Spells, and Disciplines ***&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;- Temporarily removed the AA Abundant Healing.&amp;nbsp; This ability was causing a conflict with the ability Gift of Mana.&amp;nbsp; As Gift of Mana is generally considered the more useful of the two, Abundant Healing has been removed until we can resolve the conflict.&amp;nbsp; Any points spent in Abundant Healing will be refunded &lt;BR&gt;- Dispel spells can no longer be blocked using buff blocking.&lt;BR&gt;- Harmonic Dissonance now has a 15 minute reuse time associated with it.&lt;BR&gt;- Pets will no longer instantly die when told to attack a trap they are not allowed to attack.&amp;nbsp; The owner will receive notification about why the pet did not attack.&lt;BR&gt;- You can now remove pet buffs even if they are stacked beyond 4.&lt;BR&gt;- The buffs in the pet information window will no longer show 0 time left in their tooltip.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*** Items ***&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;- Fixed the evolving item reward for the Spirit Hunter Missions in Arcstone.&amp;nbsp; If you have a cloak that is stuck in the second stage of the evolving item (Cloak of the Spirit Stalker) speak to Spirit Hunter Elijo to receive the final version. &lt;BR&gt;- Modified the Black Orb of the Scrykin quest.&amp;nbsp; The orbs of the seven dead Scrykin are now called "Gray" orbs and are tradeable.&amp;nbsp; The orbs of the six living scrykin will also drop off the appropriate scrykin (in addition to being the task rewards for completing Or`Sarro's tasks) &lt;BR&gt;- The Enraged Flesh Armor pieces are now no trade.&lt;BR&gt;- The Prophecy of Ro tier1/2 cleric breastplate now has the activated effect of Pious Elixir&lt;BR&gt;- The Prophecy of Ro tier1/2 shaman breastplate now has the activated effect of Ghost of Renewal&lt;BR&gt;- The Prophecy of Ro tier1/2 enchanter breastplate now has the activated effect of Ethereal Rune&lt;BR&gt;- The Saga of Skin Translations are now no-trade&lt;BR&gt;- The Coldain Historical Seal augmentations are now lore to each other&lt;BR&gt;- Hammer of Shadows now has 300 endurance&lt;BR&gt;- A number of items from the events in Theater of Blood now have their proper stats&lt;BR&gt;- Burning Tree Leaf now only returns at max 337 hp and mana and has reduced stats.&lt;BR&gt;- Pendant of Insurgency, Aellyâ€™s Earring, Prickly Earring, and Mary-Anneâ€™s Ring of Insanity now have monk, beastlord, and berserker as usable classes.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*** NPCs ***&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;- Farwein Windrun has returned to his camp in South Ro.&amp;nbsp; Feel free to stop by and welcome him back.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Queen Tak`Yaliz in the Desert of North Ro will no longer be missing while youâ€™re looking for her. &lt;BR&gt;- Ping Fuzzlecutter is now carrying some tasty water!&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Tak`Valnakor will now properly offer all of his tasks.&lt;BR&gt;- Boomba the Big has returned to his old stomping grounds near the west gate of Freeport.&lt;BR&gt;- Vulak`Aerr, High Priest of Veeshan, has returned to the Temple of Veeshan.&lt;BR&gt;- Gnarlibramble has loot again.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*** Zones ***&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;- Veeshan's Peak should now be in the appropriate state.&lt;BR&gt;- Guild lobby fog issues should be resolved now.&lt;BR&gt;- You should be able to bind in North and South Ro again.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

Added additional failsafes to prevent the Kromzek General from failing to leave a corpse&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Special Notes ***&lt;BR&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;- We have made really good progress on the reported issues of increased zoning times.&amp;nbsp; We would like to thank all those that have helped with this by providing detailed information.&amp;nbsp; We know what the issues are and we are in the process of implementing our solution.&amp;nbsp; We hope to have a fix that can be tested on our Test Server within the next week or so.&lt;BR&gt;- Just in the last couple of days we were able to find the line of sight issue that some of you have been reporting.&amp;nbsp; Given how close we were to our next live update, we felt that there was not a sufficient amount of time to properly test this change.&amp;nbsp; For this reason the line of sight fix will not be in this update, but will go to our Test Server this week so that we can have the proper amount of testing time to ensure that our fix actually fixes the problem and does not create any others.&amp;nbsp; Thank you for your understanding.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;-- The EverQuest Team&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;February 21st, 2006&lt;BR&gt;_____________________&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Headlines ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Prophecy of Ro Launches!&lt;BR&gt;- The Desert of Ro and the city of Freeport have been revamped&lt;BR&gt;- Alchemy system has received an overhaul&lt;BR&gt;- New Hot Zones&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Prophecy of Ro Launches! ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As a demi-god, Mayong Mistmoore -- the greatest vampire ever known -- is threatening Norrath and its gods. Druzzil Ro, the goddess of Magic, has seen the future and the darkness that lies ahead. Now, the time has come to heed Druzzil Roâ€™s calls as she opens the planes of Rage and Magic and a passage through time to the long lost Elddar elven city of Takish-Hiz. Draw your swords and prepare your magic to face the greatest fight of your lives. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The full story is available in-game in your Storyline window.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Prophecy of Ro Features ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Spheres of Influence - Spheres of Influence will appear in expansion zones as visual effects, like soft blue lights, whirling winds, or spinning axes. Any player or non-player character that enters the area of the sphere is subject to its effects. In order to see Spheres of Influence, you must have Player particles enabled in your display options.&lt;BR&gt;- Auras - Players can create Spheres of Influence called Auras. There is an Auras window available in the Character section of your EQ menu which shows your currently active auras and gives you the ability to remove them with a right-click. Player auras are available through mission rewards and events much like spells. In order to see Auras, you must have Player particles enabled in your display options.&lt;BR&gt;- Destructible Objects - Destructible objects, like walls, doors, and siege engines, are used in many of the new expansion zones. These are terrain objects that have a health points which can be depleted and, when the object has reached low enough health, it will crumble and break. As you damage the objects you will see it break down until it is completely destroyed. You can identify an object that is destructible because it will pulse when you put your mouse over it. &lt;BR&gt;- Zone Traps - Traps in EverQuest are now represented by objects that can be seen or hidden. As you would expect, traps trigger if you move into their range and you or your party, and sometimes the entire zone, can be affected by them. Rogues and bards have the ability to sense traps, reveal them to those around them, and disarm them. All traps in the game have been converted to use this new trap system.&lt;BR&gt;- Player Traps - Traps are available to players in the same way as spells and abilities, through specific quests, mission rewards, and off spell or discipline vendors. Once a trap has been memorized, it can be created by using the spell or discipline. The trap will remain in the area it is summoned until it is triggered, disarmed, removed by the player who set it using the new Remove Trap skill, or expires.&lt;BR&gt;- Buff Filters - Players can now filter beneficial spells cast upon them and their pets. By right-clicking on any active buff showing in your Effects window, you can select to remove it and/or select that it will never be allowed to take effect on your character again. Pet owners can also click off buff icons in the Pet window and apply filters to them. The list of spells being blocked can be found in the Blocked Buffs or Blocked Pet Buffs windows in the Character section of your EQ menu. &lt;BR&gt;- New Bank Space - Available bank space has been increased by 8 slots.&lt;BR&gt;- /Claim Item - If you have received the Prophecy of Ro /claim item from the retail box, Stable Ward Kyle in the Bazaar may be able to help you use it to upgrade your old horse to a warhorse. Paladins or Shadowknights who have the Holy or Unholy Steed AAs and the /claim item can upgrade their special mounts to a warhorse by visiting Stable Ward Rames as well.&lt;BR&gt;- New Tradeskills - Event Coordinator Baublie Diggs has a test for you to prove your abilities!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;See the Prophecy of Ro manual (Prophecy_of_Ro.pdf) downloaded to your EverQuest directory for more information! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;******************&lt;BR&gt;***Live Updates***&lt;BR&gt;******************&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Zone Revamps ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Freeport has been redone. East, West, and North Freeport have been replaced with a brand new East and West Freeport. All your old friends should still be there and more.&lt;BR&gt;- Desert of Ro recreated. North Ro, Oasis, and South Ro have been replaced with a new North Ro and South Ro. Watch out for Sand Giants while checking out the new scenery.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;*** New Guild Functionality ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- There is now an "Alt" button to flag a member of the guild as an alt character (this can be done by an officer on anyone, and by anyone on themselves).&lt;BR&gt;- The "Hide Alts" button will hide anyone in the guild list who is flagged as an alt. This defaults to off.&lt;BR&gt;- A "B" is no longer appended to the status of bankers. Instead there are two new columns, Banker and Alt, which have the status in them. You can sort by either Banker or Alt by clicking on the header.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** New Raid Functionality ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- There is a new raid loot option: Entire Raid. This will allow any raid member to loot NPCs killed by the raid.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** New Hot Zones ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- The time has come to once again update the "Hot Zones" throughout Norrath. The previous zones have been reverted to their former states and the following zones are now a great place to go for experience and fun:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Level 20: Najena &lt;BR&gt;Level 25: Iceclad Ocean &lt;BR&gt;Level 30: Rathe Mountains &lt;BR&gt;Level 35: Frontier Mountains &lt;BR&gt;Level 40: Gulf of Gunthak &lt;BR&gt;Level 45: Velketor's Labrynth &lt;BR&gt;Level 50: Fungus Grove &lt;BR&gt;Level 55: Old Sebilis &lt;BR&gt;Level 60: Cazic Thule &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Spells ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Increased the duration and lowered the mana cost of Talisman of the Tribunal.&lt;BR&gt;- The Test of Efficiency spell should no longer conflict with Peace of the Disciple or Grace of the Order.&lt;BR&gt;- Increased the damage and lowered the mana on Touch of Inruku to better match the rest of the spell line's progression.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** AAs ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- The way that the wizard AA Mana Burn works has been modified. The new version will use a maximum of 3000 mana instead of draining your whole pool and will do 4 damage for every point of mana spent. This is a raw channeling of magical energy that cannot be focused and will not critically hit. The ability is unresistable by normal creatures, but certain special creatures may be immune to the effects. Like the previous version, once a Mana Burn ability has affected a target, no other Mana Burn abilities will be able to affect that target for the next minute. Upgraded versions of the ability, Mana Blast and Mana Blaze, are available at level 65 and level 70 and use a maximum of 6000 and 9000 mana respectively. The original Mana Burn ability has been refunded and can be repurchased by Wizards interested in the new version.&lt;BR&gt;- Gift of Mana will no longer be used up when you cast a 0 mana spell and now has a chance to trigger on heals other than just instant heals, including heal-over-time and percent healing spells.&lt;BR&gt;- Rogues and Bards have a new AA ability called Thief's Intuition. This ability goes hand-in-hand with the new trap system and allows those classes a chance to automatically sense nearby traps. The new AAs can be found in the Class tab. &lt;BR&gt;- There are new special mounts available for Paladins and Shadowknights under the Class AA tab.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Events ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- The planar projection for defeating Mithaniel Marr was not rewarding the correct character flags. This has been fixed.&lt;BR&gt;- Raids in Dynamic zones in Gates of Discord now require a minimum of 12 people to be started.&lt;BR&gt;- Sendaii the Hive Queen raid will now lock out the expedition after the glowing egg is broken.&lt;BR&gt;- NPCâ€™s should no longer re-spawn after being killed in the Controlling the Beast mission set in Stoneroot Falls.&lt;BR&gt;- The mission "Taking Control" from Stoneroot Falls now only requires 3 people to start it.&lt;BR&gt;- Adjusted the rewards on monster missions so they scale better based on how long itâ€™s actually taking to complete the mission.&lt;BR&gt;- It should be much more difficult for Stefan Marsinger to die within one of the Greater Faydark spires.&lt;BR&gt;- Various magician epic mobs should no longer double, triple, or quadruple spawn for every mage that enters the zone.&lt;BR&gt;- A number of changes were made to the Demi-Plane of Blood, including pathing fixes, tuning tweaks, and bonuses for defeating Mayong. For more information, see the EQLive forums.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Missions ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Monster Mission XP rewards have tuned to better account for the amount of time required to complete the mission. Longer missions now give more XP while shorter missions give less. In addition, the way XP is rewarded has been refactored so it scales better as you gain levels.&lt;BR&gt;- In Stoneroot Falls, mission givers Kelliad and Widdlethorpe will now offer you missions that you have completed previously in each of their story arcs when requesting the mission that you are currently on.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Tasks ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Added a timer to normal tasks. You can now only complete a task once every 15 minutes. As with shared tasks, the time counts from when you initially get the task, so if it took you longer than 15 minutes to complete the task, you can immediately get another one. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Tradeskills ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Alchemy has undergone some changes resulting in modifications to old recipes as well as introducing new recipes and potions, smoother progression in the skill, and significant cost reductions.&lt;BR&gt;- Potions - All old-style (10 charge, non stackable) alchemical potions have been removed and replaced by an equivalent potion in the revamped system. These new potions are stackable up to 20 per stack. Note: Due to an error that did not show up on our testing, this was not completed, but only partially done. Some players will have their items exchanged, some will not. The old potions will still function, despite the fact that there will be no way to make them. You can still make the new potions using the new recipes once the community discovers them. We will correct this error and do this exchange the next patch after it has been re-tested.&lt;BR&gt;- Recipes - All recipes that point to the old-style alchemical potions no longer exist. New recipes have been created for all of the new potions and will use new herbs. &lt;BR&gt;- Herbs - Many old herbs have had their prices altered and new herbs have been introduced, both as purchased components as well as dropped components. &lt;BR&gt;- Planar Fletching Kits are now tradeable.&lt;BR&gt;- Changed Othmir Short Beer to use a bottle instead of a Cask.&lt;BR&gt;- Deep Orc Essence now requires less meat.&lt;BR&gt;- Disabled the spell research creation of the spell Draught of Lightning. This was done because it is a quest derived spell.&lt;BR&gt;- Some very old erudite only combines have had their trivials adjusted up from being no-fail to on par with other combines of that era.&lt;BR&gt;-The Research Recipe to make Unholy Bellow has been disabled.&lt;BR&gt;- The Rusty Mining Pick used by Druids has changed names, but works exactly the same.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Items ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Changed the Slot12 Tradeskill augments that have Cleave, Ferocity, Furious Bash, Improved Dodge, Improved Parry and Sharpshooting to be worn effects instead of focus effects.&lt;BR&gt;- Made a few minor modifications to damage ratios on some of the Demi-Plane of Blood weapons.&lt;BR&gt;- Set a cap on the maximum amount of skill bonuses you can get from certain worn effects. The caps are for bash (100), backstab (125), dragon punch (100), eagle strike (100), flying kick (100), kick (100), round kick (100), tiger claw (100), and frenzy (125).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** General Bug Fixes ***&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Players will no longer see their breath in first person while on a boar mount.&lt;BR&gt;- Froglok jump animation will now play at normal speed.&lt;BR&gt;- Skeleton illusions will now function correctly on boar mounts.&lt;BR&gt;- PCs will no longer warp to the location they were charmed or feared when those spells wear off.&lt;BR&gt;- The autofire ability will now turn off when a player sits down or loots a corpse.&lt;BR&gt;- Charmed PCs will no longer disappear after being stationary for a few seconds.&lt;BR&gt;- When alt-tabbing out of full screen mode and then re-entering the game, you should now properly be put back into full screen mode instead of windowed mode.&lt;BR&gt;- Players marked as group leaders in a raid would sometimes not have functioning leader abilities. This was happening when reforming groups in the raid and has been fixed.&lt;BR&gt;- Players will no longer remain encumbered by coin after donating that coin to a guild tribute master.&lt;BR&gt;- If a player is wearing an item with a focus effect and casts a delayed spell that utilizes that focus effect, it will no longer be negating if they use a clicky effect before it lands.&lt;BR&gt;- Fixed sync issues with removing shared tasks and tasks from a player.&lt;BR&gt;- Throwing axes will no longer throw an entire stack, instead only a single axe will be consumed from the range slot.&lt;BR&gt;- The map window should now be available to all players.&lt;BR&gt;- Fixed a problem that was causing several of the Dragons of Norrath items to have the wrong colors.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- The EverQuest Team&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Kytherea on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;02-21-2006&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;01:46 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;December 7th, 2005&lt;BR&gt;_____________________&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Headlines ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;~ Holiday Festival ~&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;M.C. Tinkerton needs help repairing his Clockwork Party Machine in time to celebrate 3199!&amp;nbsp; The party machine's dance gyroscopes, firework cannons and party favor dispensers are fully functional, but the most important piece, the machine's primary party motivator, was stolen at the zero hour.&amp;nbsp; M.C. Tinkerton seeks adventurers to steal back the primary party motivator from the Dark Mistletoe giants, a grouchy clan of frost giant nomads in the Great Divide.&amp;nbsp; Seek out M.C. Tinkerton in the Plane of Knowledge for further details. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;~ New Arena ~&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;A new arena zone is now available off of Lake Rathe!&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Tradeskill ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Shield of Maelin now uses the proper quill.&lt;BR&gt;- The following LDoN spell research recipes have been disabled:&amp;nbsp; Death's Despair, Instinctual Panic, Eidolon Bellow, Soulless Panic, Angstlich's Echo of Terror, Jitterskin, Unholy Bellow, Shadow Bellow, Call of the Muse, Guidance.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Jar of Clockwork Grease is now made with a Small Grease Jar in a toolbox. A Small Grease Jar is made the same way a clay jar is, except that you use a Small Grease Jar Sketch. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Events, Missions &amp;amp; Tasks ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Additional text has been added to "Investigate a Disappearance" that should help clear up a confusing spot late in the task.&lt;BR&gt;- Soulseeker, Death's Sigh can no longer drop more than once per kill.&lt;BR&gt;- The Mask of the Hidden quest in the Ascent now resets properly after 1 hour of inactivity. &lt;BR&gt;-&amp;nbsp; Monster Mission experience now properly takes into account hell level modifiers.&amp;nbsp; These modifiers smooth out the experience curve to lessen the impact of the old hell levels (30, 35, 40, and 45).&amp;nbsp; Inclusion of these modifiers in the monster experience will cause you to gain more experience than before during hell levels, essentially returning it to a normal level, but you will gain slightly less experience than before when you are not on a hell level. &lt;BR&gt;- Within Monster Missions, you will now find Shards of Wisdom that will impart upon you the experiences of the creature you inhabit at the time.&amp;nbsp; Looting one of these shards will grant the experience to your main character upon successful completion of the mission.&lt;BR&gt;- Aid Fimli in the Plane of Knowledge will now offer to trade you a Cloak of Lesser Pernicity for a Cloak of Greater Pernicity. This is for players who wish to have the original cloak instead of the new, attunable cloak.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Clockwork Commander Cogswain has outfitted his clockwork models with upgraded weaponry for the War Machines monster mission that begins in Lavastorm. He only has a limited supply of Clockwork Models in commission, so be careful with them.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Farsoth Mal has regained some of his power deep within the Lair of Splitpaw. Defeating him may prove a bigger challenge than before!&lt;BR&gt;- Dinner invitations to Dreadspire Keep are now flame-resistant and reusable.&lt;BR&gt;- The Performer event will now respawn properly after a failure.&lt;BR&gt;- The respawn time on many NPCs in the Demiplane of Blood has been significantly increased.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Items ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Archaeologist Flottwit has uncovered a cache of older Darkhollow items and is currently searching the bazaar for some of the newer items for comparison. If you have a Depths of Darkhollow item that changed from tradeable to no trade with the last patch and you'd prefer to have the old tradeable item instead, give the no trade version to Flottwit and he'll give you the old tradeable item in return. Flottwit will only be around until the next patch. &lt;BR&gt;- Heartlight is now no-drop, poof-on-death, and no-rent.&lt;BR&gt;- The mixing bowl and oven now identify Rockhopper eggs more clearly. &lt;BR&gt;- The Cultural Charms should now be tradeable on Firiona Vie. &lt;BR&gt;- Sporali Battle Hammer of Spirits and Daybreak, Bringer of Light have had their proc chances modified.&lt;BR&gt;- Vule's Frozen Heart and Frozen Heart Shards now have +30 atk, +3 accuracy, and reduced weight.&lt;BR&gt;- The hitpoint and mana values on the following items have been increased: Ring of Dark Mists, Dark Void Shoulders, Jagged Coral Choker, and Pristine Illsalin Stonecraft Mask. &lt;BR&gt;- Some of the Depths of Darkhollow hp/mana augmentations were increased too much in the last patch and have been reverted to their old values.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** NPC ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Hatchet the Torturer will now always leave a corpse when slain. &lt;BR&gt;- Nitram Anizok has become interested in some of the clockwork that are near the Plane of Innovation entrance. He will now wander from his workshop and explore the entry to the plane for a few minutes before returning to his workshop.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Titles ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Corrected an issue that prevented server-based suffixes for the Cazic Thule server from being displayed properly.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Spells ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Renamed "Zombie Malaise" to "Wurine Guard" and "Wurine Guard" to "Zombie Malaise". This is to correct an inconsistency in the naming. &lt;BR&gt;- Corrected the spelling of "Thief" in the description for the spell Enduring Vision.&lt;BR&gt;- Capitalized "Eyes" in the spell Thief's Eyes.&lt;BR&gt;- Fixed issues with the Aura of Arcanum spells to allow better stacking with other resist buffs.&lt;BR&gt;- Summon Companion will now summon a pet even when you have Steadfast Servant up.&lt;BR&gt;- Field of Vision spells will now stay persistent through zoning.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** AAs ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Gift of Mana will no longer trigger on any spell that costs no mana to cast.&lt;BR&gt;- The monk AA Eye Gouge is now more effective and will stack better with other attack debuffs.&lt;BR&gt;- The magician AA Elemental Agility should now properly cause your pet to be hit less often.&lt;BR&gt;- Guardian of Ro ranks 2 and 3 will now properly increase the damage that your Guardian of Ro does.&lt;BR&gt;- Attempting to use Living Shield before the cool down is finished should no longer result in an error message.&lt;BR&gt;- When Bards use the Origin ability it can now be interrupted by ducking.&lt;BR&gt;- AA's should no longer vanish from your AA list until you zone.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** UI ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- A bug where the UI could not be reloaded more than a few times has been fixed.&lt;BR&gt;- The 'Skills' option on the EQ menu has been moved down into the player information sub-menu.&lt;BR&gt;- Added new EQType label "Target of Target Name", type 135, at the request of the UI community.&lt;BR&gt;- Added optional "CloseButton" button to the Story Window at the request of the UI community. The default UI doesn't have this button, but if UI creators want it they can add one now.&lt;BR&gt;- The UI XML parser has been slightly optimized, slower computers may notice a slight decrease in load times.&lt;BR&gt;- Through a change to defaults.ini, the way the Evolving Item XP Transfer window opens should no longer obscure parts of the window. &lt;BR&gt;- A Bazaar Search UI bug where the All Effects filter would no longer bring up weapons with combat effects has been fixed.&lt;BR&gt;- The bandolier window is now persistent across a zone change.&lt;BR&gt;- Hotkeys in the hotbar as well as in the actions window will remain useable when you exit a monster mission.&lt;BR&gt;- It is no longer possible to get 2 group leaders in the same group in the raid window.&lt;BR&gt;- In the Bard Songs Window, all icons should now appear the same size and not overlap each other.&lt;BR&gt;- Fixed a bug with groups and raids where if group member with a shared task /raidinvites a separate player with a different shared task, the group players become bugged.&lt;BR&gt;- Fixed a crash related to minimizing the chat window to as small as it can go.&lt;BR&gt;- Swapping to a weapon configuration that includes a light source in the bandolier should now activate that light source.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Miscellaneous ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Corpses that were under the world when a zone starts up are now moved to the safe spot of the zone. &lt;BR&gt;- Sharvahl and Hollowshade now use Luclin night settings for the sky. Previously there was no sky in these zones. &lt;BR&gt;- The /safelock command now prevents the Esc key from altering in game windows while safelock is activated. &lt;BR&gt;- You can now no longer summon a horse while controlling a boat. &lt;BR&gt;- If a tracking class enters a monster mission that has a template with track, their sort track will now work correctly afterwards.&lt;BR&gt;- /Dzadding a character that is zoning should no longer cause various bugs.&lt;BR&gt;- Various atlas typos have been corrected. Grobb was spelled Gukta; even the trolls could spell enough to tell that was wrong.&lt;BR&gt;- New Half Elves can now claim Kelethin as their starting city.&lt;BR&gt;- Fixed a problem most often seen in the Tutorial where Arias would attack the player if they use the hide ability. This was a general bug; any NPCs that were told to follow the player because of a script would agro when the player tried to hide.&lt;BR&gt;- The '/who all' command will now filter searches for Frogloks.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;November 16th, 2005&lt;BR&gt;_____________________&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Depths of Darkhollow***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Many of the single group attainable rewards from the Depths of Darkhollow expansion have received significant upgrades.&amp;nbsp; This includes more than 1,000 items from all over the expansion.&amp;nbsp; Also, to allow players who have deleted items a chance to get them again, the rewards you get for completing a mission the first time are now given to you whenever you complete the mission and do not already have the reward.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We've also made many tuning changes to the DoD missions to provide a smoother ramp up in difficulty over the course of the expansion.&amp;nbsp; In general, earlier missions are now a bit easier and missions further into the expansion are now a bit more challenging, particularly the hard level missions.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** New Monster Missions ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- A gnollish zealot has been spotted near the bridge in South Karana. He speaks of the rift within Paw and the final whereabouts of the son of Ishva Mal. Perhaps there is still hope for the prisoners within.&lt;BR&gt;- The Solusek Mining Company has begun recruiting clockwork pilots for a special mission.&amp;nbsp; Report to Clockwork Commander Widgetsworth in Lavastorm for further details. &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Spells ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Several of the abilities used by NPCs in the Demi-Plane of Blood have been modified.&lt;BR&gt;- The Enchanter spell Apathy of the Nihil has been replaced with Dreary Deeds, an upgrade to Forlorn Deeds.&lt;BR&gt;- E`ci's Frosty Breath and Glacier Breath are now much harder to resist.&lt;BR&gt;- Blood of the Spire is now a more potent mana preservation focus.&lt;BR&gt;- Ravenous Hunger has been changed. It is now named "Ravenous Sloth" and is a 40% duration extender on the spell "Lingering Sloth".&lt;BR&gt;- The Aura of Arcanum line of spells should now have the correct spell description.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Items ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Pumpkin lovers rejoice! Pumpkin items now stack.&lt;BR&gt;- The spell Servant of Marr now properly requires Ink of the Companion.&lt;BR&gt;- Some of the ores that did not stack before now stack. This is from a list provided by the community.&lt;BR&gt;- The drop rate on Shards of Dark Matter has been increased. The high-end Gates of Discord bosses will now drop at least one of them every time they are killed.&lt;BR&gt;- The weight on all versions of the Mask of Horror for the Halloween event has been decreased.&lt;BR&gt;- Ensorcelled Great Sword of the Night should now proc correctly for players at level 55 and greater who can wield the sword. The Greatsword is also more visually imposing.&lt;BR&gt;- All none/none flagged containers in the game are now flagged as all/all. This should fix some issues with containers not showing up in varied item searches in the bazaar and item point vendors.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Some of the "Last Blood" augmentations now have stronger focus effects.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Darkhollow Constitutional will now return a normal cork, not the dissolving kind.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Statuette of the Tranquil is now called "Amice of the Tranquil" and is a shoulder slot item. The AC has been increased and the avoidance has been replaced with accuracy. &lt;BR&gt;- Woven Shadow Shroud is now called "Woven Shadow Stone" and is a range slot item. The item now has points in backstab damage.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Razorsharp Shortsword is now not usable by berserkers.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Dragon Scale Tiara is now named "Dragon Scale Eyepatch"&lt;BR&gt;- Azure Sleeves of the Diplomat and Azure Cowl of the Diplomat have lost their +attack bonus.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Azure Slippers of the Diplomat have lost their attack bonus and have received a +2 to mana regen.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Eulogy, the Bloodthirsty Blade now has higher hit points. &lt;BR&gt;- Bard instruments will drop less frequently in the Demi-Plane of Blood and a maximum of once per kill.&lt;BR&gt;- The Insidious Hooded Cloak now has its specialization modifier set to alteration instead of conjuration.&lt;BR&gt;- The Ancient Werewolf Skull evolving item now has augmentation slots at each stage in evolution.&lt;BR&gt;- The Sharpshooting VI spell effect on Soulseeker, Death's Sigh is now worn instead of combat. &lt;BR&gt;- The Polished Chitin War Horn now has an augment slot.&lt;BR&gt;- Ancient Cudgel of Slaughter now has resistance modifiers. &lt;BR&gt;- Though it is still magnetic, a magnetic metal brick will no longer stick to your hands.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Missions, Tasks &amp;amp; Quests ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- Adjusted the experience reward for monster missions to better reflect the amount of effort the mission requires.&amp;nbsp; Missions that could be finished very quickly are now worth less experience and missions that are taking longer to complete are now worth more experience.&lt;BR&gt;- High Seas Rogues have regained the ability to evade!&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- All Drachnid Hive level 65 missions should now give out the appropriate one time rewards.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Artisan Dosan Visâ€™Moor, Vivian Selgan, and Gart Okken should now be accepting items for the tasks that they give.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Additional text has been added to the "Investigate a Disappearance" task that begins in Freeport that should help clear up a confusing spot late in the task.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- Aid Fimli in the Plane of Knowledge will now reward you with a cloak of lesser pernicity that matches the stats of the original cloak of greater pernicity. In addition the cloak of greater pernicity has been changed to be attunable.&amp;nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;- The Misty for You quest now works properly.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** UI ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- The GuildManagement window has a new tab "Information", which contains the MOTD fields, as well as two new fields for Guild web URL and Guild channel specification. These new fields are changeable by the Guild leader only.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** Tradeskills ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- The spell Light of Order will now use the proper ink.&lt;BR&gt;- Poison Vials made with Crows Special Brew now show properly in the Tradeskill UI.&lt;BR&gt;- Players baking with pumpkin will now get their tools back when they mess up.&lt;BR&gt;- Players making Spiced Pumpkin Cider no longer have to hold it in their hands. The recipe now requires a bottle.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*** NPCS ***&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- The Knight of the Dread Sun will now make his appearance more often.&lt;BR&gt;- Fixed an issue in Dreadspire that could cause some of the residents of the crypt to aggro through the roof.&lt;BR&gt;- Ogres will now be able to get the thread for their cultural armor without having to fight off guards.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
