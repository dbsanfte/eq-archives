				Zajeer your are forgetting how much time raiding takes each day, especially for players in "hardcore" raiding guilds. <br><br>Raiders do 1 group content quite a bit, but they do it outside of their official raiding times in doses they want. How much time out of raid people have veries quite a bit. <br><br>Just don't make the mistake you did with TSS again and FORCE raiders to do excessive ammount of non raiding content when you design raid progression. <br><br>If you make good grup content with uniq rewards raiders will come and do the content alot (dodh anyone?). Just make sure the content is fun also. =P<br><br>Back to charm augs ....it's about time LDoN aug is retired as the best one available.<p>Message Edited by Meph-AB on <span class=date_text>12-13-2006</span> <span class=time_text>07:52 AM</span>

				I tend to agree that charm augs should come from non-raid content.<br>
<br>
Unfortunatly, the raiders doing non-raider comment you made - I'm not
challenged in any way by non-raid content.&nbsp; It's not really fun
for me to do it, other than if required to get a reward.<br>
<br>
The best part of EQ grouping for raiders shouldn't be a carrot - it
should also include fun, challenge, excitement, risk, etc.&nbsp; I
played on progression for quite awhile with friends.&nbsp; We had hella
fun times levels 15-55 taking on hard content where death was a very
large risk.&nbsp; Where we were constantly challenged.&nbsp; Despite
the fact that I did that content 7+ years ago, and I was on low
level/new/gimp toons - it was still fun just to be challenged.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
That simply does not exist in today's group game for us as raiders, and
I shouldn't have to switch to some character besides my main to
experience it in a groups etting.<br>
<br>
Theres a reason 90% of my guild logs on only for raids.&nbsp; The other
10% - its pretty much powersources only atm.&nbsp; It's sort of sad -
because we've all had tons of fun at one point being challenged in the
group game - but not anytime recently really.<br>
<br>
So what am I trying to say in regards to your comment?&nbsp; Just that
I'm refuting your comment about raiders not being in enough group
content.&nbsp; It's entirely true, but your reasoning for it is that
there isn't rewards for it (partially true).&nbsp; Instead, its more of
- theres no fun/challenge in it, in addition to being no reward.<br>

<P>VP key quest sucked. Was far worse than TSS.</P>
<P>Velious faction sucked, as did keying for ST. Not every guild/player could get that huge faction hit by killing the zone boss - and ST keys were not as common as they are today. Huge time sink. Huge. You actually need a new definition of huge to understand just how bad it was.</P>
<P>Luclin Emp key, Emp weapon and then VT shard camps. Holy wow, I am almost insulted folks are complaining about TSS when I go back over these horrible time sinks.</P>
<P>PoP had raid&nbsp;flags. Every zone past PoJ. Nothing else needs to be said.</P>
<P>GoD was just a horrible horrible content mistune.</P>
<P>OOW you not only had to camp the sigs, but do the MPG raid trials. Something today's players do not have to do - just sigs.</P>
<P>DoDH and PoR? I retired just before DoDH launch.&nbsp; After returning getting DS/DP keyed took me <STRONG><EM>months. </EM></STRONG>PoR isn't going so hot, either. Getting folks to do the same old instances juust doesn't seem to hold the same replay value. Instanced progression usually caters to certain class/group designs. Not much room for flexibility there.</P>
<P>TSS progression is just Exp grinding in open zones. No instances, not everyone needs to have the task - different folks can get different tasks completed in the same group or solo. It put the Quest back into <EM>Ever<STRONG>Quest</STRONG></EM>. It is actually horribly easy to do. Drops are common, repops are fast (not 12 hours +/- or 3 days etc).</P>
<P>EverQuest used to be hard. Instancing brought a little too much convenience to the playerbase. Some people will always prefer it. Some will always prefer open zones. It is important to balance those wants and needs of the plaer base. So far, TSS has offered very little in the way of progression blocks or bottlenecks. It is all up to the initiative of the playerbase. Anyone can get raid flagged.</P>
<P>Just have to go after it with determination and flexibility.</P>

<P>If the raid encounters in TSS gave faction hits (Stitch giving Infiltraitor, Sothgar giving Scholars), I'd like the system Much more.&nbsp; I'm dreading 2 months from now when 99% of the guild is done and apps are trying to get groups to go do eggtenders or arbitor and you trying to juggle who gets raided in.&nbsp; If instead each raid win gave faction, even half of a single tasks worth, it would make it so those that put forth the raid effort eventually get 'flagged'.&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Honestly, why would Jenray give faction for bagging 4 drakes from eggs, but not really care that you stopped Sothgar lashing out?</P>
