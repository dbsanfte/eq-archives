				<DIV>My next exprience I decided to meet with this enchanter "lady". We had several nights of talking dirty late in the night while playing Everquest. So, we met and to my horror, she was a he. I never talked to him again the sicko.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>So after awhile of chatting with this necro lady, we decided to meet in person.&nbsp; I do not remember much after that as I awoke in a hole in the ground in the basement of some house being hosed down with a water hose. Apparently, this lady was a man as well. He lowered down a basket with lotion and instisted, " it puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again." After being tormented like this for a week or so the cops finally burst in busting the guy for kiddie porn, and rescuing me in the process. I swore I would never meet another person again after that.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>But, then I never was very good at keeping to my guns on stuff like that so I met up with this shaman lady. She was fun and carefree, about the only problem was she had allittle bit of junk in the trunk, after some exercise and less sweets she was definately top shelf.&nbsp; With her new found hotness there was a whole new world to explore so, we parted ways but still remain friends.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>My next date with an Everquest gal, was with this Warrior lady.&nbsp; Well, she kind of screamed and shouted at everything was really aggressive.&nbsp; Very athletic and strong. I gave her a try for a bit hoping she would chill out some. It was constant&nbsp; the oh no she did not just did not wear that shirt with that skirt and shoes, like she was better than everyone else. Eventually I tired of her outlook on life and went my seperate way, but, she came up to my doorstep crying in a bikini begging me to take her back saying she could not do anything alone. So, I slammed the door on her face.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>After a long break from dating in game ladies, I eventually met up with this monk gal. She&nbsp;had quite a package on her and she wore loose clothing that kinda hinted at what she had but never really revealed anything.&nbsp; She had a sparkling personality was quite fun and entertaining to be around. And the lovemaking, can you say tantra, I think you can, quite amazing.&nbsp; Then one day out it came she wanted to do everything, and leave nothing for anyone else to do. She wanted to be the star of everything, and everyone else could burn to death as far as she was concerned.&nbsp; So after what I thought could have been the one I had to let her go.</DIV>
