&lt;P&gt;ooooh.. this is music to my ears.&amp;nbsp; I'm not on the beta server, but I was really hoping they would move more in the directin of making this EQ classic.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If I wanted EQ as it is today, I would plan on an active server.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <title>My 2 cents</title>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Apparently the EQ Classic fanatics have had their way.&amp;nbsp; My plans to play extensively on this server are pretty much trashed at this point since I just wanted a chance to play content and not put up with all the folks who whined so hard that they made the beta a challenge to play through til last night when the latest round of changes occurred.&amp;nbsp; As far as I can see all the promises made about this being a server with the same rules as the live servers other than the various expansions have gone out the window.&amp;nbsp; I may stop by occasionally but this experience has been ruined for me.&amp;nbsp; Again, just my own personal comments and I don't really expect anyone else to agree, disagree, flame, whatever.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>
