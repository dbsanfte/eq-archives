<DIV><FONT color=#ffffff>I have to totally agree with the first reply in this forum.&nbsp; "Chanters will break yer heart like no ones business."&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT color=#ffffff>I never thought that I would meet someone online, much less in a MMORPG.&nbsp; But it happenned.&nbsp; I met her one night at a randomly gathered Butcherblock LDoN.&nbsp; We ended up doing quite a few that night, we talked throughout most of them and I told her that I would not let harm come to her...even if I had to sacrifice my ranger so she could gate.&nbsp; This ended up happening more than a few times as LDoN was fairly new and we weren't the best at these adventures.&nbsp; We ended up grouping together consistently and talking well into the night after the fighting was over.&nbsp; Turns out that she was living with her bf who played a necro on our server, but she was very unhappy with the way he ignored her.&nbsp; We grouped and talked for about 20 more levels and then we started talking to each other on the phone from time to time.&nbsp; By this time we had a really good bond and we felt a deep connection ( I thought).&nbsp; She seemed like minded so we finally shared pictures of ourselves...and she turned out to be gorgeous.&nbsp; She seemed to be just as interested in me and we continued to talk.&nbsp; Things were here and there for the next few months, mainly because I had work moving that I had to do and then get set back up on EQ.&nbsp; I was supposed to meet her on vacation in about a month and I was really looking forward to it.&nbsp; I even overextended myself financially to make the trip.&nbsp;&nbsp;A week before the trip she tells me that her bf has really started acting nicely towards her and that their relationship was turning around.&nbsp; I couldn't bring myself to go see her...I thought that I had felt something for her....as strange as it would seem.</FONT></DIV>
