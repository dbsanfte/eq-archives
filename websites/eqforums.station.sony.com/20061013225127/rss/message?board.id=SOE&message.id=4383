    <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I'm just wondering why there is even a stuck character channel when the channel is always moderated and the GM's never respond to direct tells... Waited 10 minutes this morning for my character to clear itself out cause I couldnt get a boot&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Stuckchar channel is a life-saver for port 33797 victims :) I've had&#xD;
only good experiences with it :) Yes,the wait can sometimes be 20 mins,&#xD;
but it happens, which is the important thing to me. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br&gt;&#xD;
Only issue I ever had with it, was that it was not up a few days ago,&#xD;
but thinking they just forgot. Has been up since I believe. &lt;br&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=4&gt;I'm a frequent visitor of the stuck character channel and I have noticed of late they have been getting MUCH better about getting me outta there faster :)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=4&gt;Thanks GMS! :)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Yeah ok I realy hope and adim reads this I was sitting in Stuck channel.&amp;nbsp; For over 30 mins&amp;nbsp; and asked for help and Waited mind you there was NO ONE ELSE IN CHANNEL other than the last five mins.&amp;nbsp; And I told the guy good luck becuase I had been waiting.&amp;nbsp; When the GM finally helps me he says Good luck to you 2 and nothing else.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I had said that to a coustomer that pays for a sevice I provided I know they wouldn't ever come back... not to mention I was&amp;nbsp; insulted by it. Thent he GM tells me I have already booted you so I log back in and&amp;nbsp; I WAS NOT TAKEN CARE OF AT ALL.. I was still stuck in the wall that I had camped in.&amp;nbsp; Then I crash out he must have finally started to move me mind you it has been 40 mins&amp;nbsp; of waiting now.&amp;nbsp; BTW the GM's&amp;nbsp; Name was Masden.&amp;nbsp; .... Just an idea but maybe&amp;nbsp; as long as we arn't in a raid zone you should let us&amp;nbsp; return home sooner&amp;nbsp; would have saided alot of time and not made another customer start looking at other games.</description>

      <description>Would be nice if we could boot ourselves with something like the /rewind command.&amp;nbsp; Although I know it wouldn't be possible due to all sorts of other issues that would arise with that.&amp;nbsp; Maybe they could code something in where if you were logging in and get the message "This zone is unavailable," it would kick your character to Nexus (no one's KoS there and sometimes PoK is down so PoK wouldn't work).&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;They do sometimes respond. It does suck waiting :( .&amp;nbsp; I often wonder whether their direct boss knows that players sometimes sit, the only&amp;nbsp;one in the room, for long intervals without any response at all from the GM 'on duty.'&amp;nbsp; Is hanging out in the stuck character room just one of their many responsibilities?&amp;nbsp; Do they need a beep to play when a character enters so they know to come back from afk?&amp;nbsp; It would be nice to know what's going on there.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Previously there used to be 1-2 GM in the room and actively monitored, but that was changed up about the time that GMs were no longer actively seen on the servers.  At the same time they added to the Petition stuck character (I hadnt seen it previously, so it is possible it was already there), but they use the chatrooms as a base to monitor the petitions.</description>
