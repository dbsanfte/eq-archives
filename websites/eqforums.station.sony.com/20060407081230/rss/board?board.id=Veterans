      <title>Fabled "Problem" (Dev Feedback Please)</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=213271#M213271</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;I know this is not the first year for fabled items, but this is the first year I have actually gone after the Fabled Tranquil Staff in Karnor's Castle for my beastlord. I've noticed only one thing that really makes this staff disappointing. The proc is a DD Stun that only works on mobs up to level 55. Is there any possible way to upgrade the stun to effect mobs of a higher level (preferably 70) since you have to be level 65 to even equip the item? I mean, seriously now... The goal for fableds was to make old world drops usable in the &amp;quot;current&amp;quot; world, right? What level 65+ Monk or Beastlord is going to be killing level 55 and below mobs for XP? Anyway, I just thought I'd ask about possibly making a change there as that fact alone makes the weapon lose some appeal.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I currently do not have the anguish ancient spell for my bard, and as such the nuke/dot focus component of my 70 aura is an upgrade to me.  I was just wondering if the aura disappearing when i use fading memories is intended, cos it's super annoying.  I have to keep this aura memmed at all times now which seriously diminishes the amount of utility songs I can have memmed at 1 time.  I have 9 song slots.  The songs i need to keep memmed at all times are(for 1 group stuff) :  selo, hos, mez, 4 song twist, invis and aura.... that leaves me no slots left when grouping for:  pacify, slow, snare, psalm for an alternate twist etc.  Is this a bug, or the way the aura is intended to work for bards?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I have recently been struck by a strong feeling of nostalgia and as such have been fighting alot in Luclin zones and seeing what I can take on solo that used to be grouped/raided (ie: Va'Dyn down to mage powa!).  In doing so I remembered that my guild basically skipped VT and I never finished my key off.  So I lack a rift for the Scepter of Shadows, and the comm1 drop for the Emp key.  So I figured while farming ssra for scales (new cash cow) I would catch comm1 up and finish off that key. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well I have probably put in about 10-12 hours soloing the entire first floor (save for Blood/Emp tube thats locked) and I cannot for the life of me get comm1 to spawn.  I have had numerous trackers in the zone and I know he isnt up in the locked area, however nothing I do makes him spawn.  I got my comm2 drop in about 45min-1hr of clearing PHs on floor two, and yet the comm1 drop is killing me. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Is there something that I am not doing right?  Because it is my understanding that his PH can basically be any shissar on floor 1, but most commonly he pops in the various tube rooms.  I have cleared everything, repeatedly, time and time again, and yet no comm1. &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I cant stand the &amp;quot;improved&amp;quot; versions of old world zones.. I really wish there were an option not to use the new zones.. like the luclin models where you could turn them on or off. Or maby make each revamped zone have 2 instances.. one messed up and one classic.  Id also like to see an option to use the oldschool ui..&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I didn't want to crap all over someone elses thread, so here's a new one to attempt to discuss casual content.  Origional thread is &lt;a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=212618" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This will likely fall on deaf ears, but if you could &lt;u&gt;please&lt;/u&gt; try to do the following things if you chose to reply:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Keep flaming to a minimum. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Take a few minutes, gather your thoughts, and use as much detail as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Don't use a solid block of text.  For the love of Cazic, hit Enter a few times now and then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I would ask the Dev's why they keep on listening to the raiding elite and do not put in more content for the casual players and why when content for casuals is added they then nerf it too oblivion.&amp;quot; - &lt;a href="../view_profile?user.id=83977" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ardeah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I personally consider myself to be a casual player.  I really am not a fan of raiding, and the only raids I have participated in recently have been various 1.5 raids to help my friends, and raids on rune dropping mobs in oow.  Durring the week I'm usually on for 2-3 hours most days, more on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  My magelo, should you need to see it, is &lt;a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=308000" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;For those of you who feel that SoE only listens to the top ~1%, what exactly are you looking for in casual content?  What do you consider the breakoff between casual and raider content?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I personally have a list of things to do in game that cover Velious to DoD, that could take me a year to get done with my play time.  From a 10th ring war, couple of fun items I still want to camp, trying all the DoN missions at least once, doing a tipt trial, do all the MPG group trials, and finishing off as many DoD missions as I can.  That's just for starters. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Needless to say, I see things differently.  There has been a massive increase in casual content and greater rewards for said content.  I think when I hit 70 I had just under 3k unbuffed hp, and after a lot of work, I just broke 6k unbuffed, and my sights are now set on 7k.  I don't even have PoR yet, so the list of things to do will only grow once I get off my lazy butt and buy it.&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Has this event been changed?  The first couple times we went against this PITA his silence AE ended once he became unrooted.  We've been having warp issues pulling him into the hallway, so we decided to fight him where he stands on our last attempt.  He kept on casting his AE silence/snare, which prevented procs and disciplines (such as bellow), and with no reliable taunt, we wiped much quicker than when we pulled him into the hall. &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Odd and somewhat reproduceable bug</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=212616#M212616</link>
      <description>No idea how long this bug has been around, maybe since the release of DoN but  when you are in /trader mode in bazaar and do have some radiants or ebons crystal listed for sale, clicking on reclaim button causes all the crystals to be moved into those 2 slots.  But sometimes and only sometimes, bazaar gets updated of your crystal's removal.  Other time, it still shows up oin/bazaar as having some for sale but if a buyer browses you the crystal are nowhere to be found.  When I click on List Items in trader box, I get this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://personalpages.tds.net/%7Ewilykat/eq/bazaarbug.JPG"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Line #11 are supposed to be radiant crystals and line #12 are supposed to be ebon crystals but since I clicked on reclaim and bazaar didn't update properly they still show up yet are missing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do not lose the crystals they are in crystals slot in inventory, all I can do is waste some buyer's time looking for the crystals.  I am positive there is no exploit from this but only a time wasting bug.  It is possible this bug could be used to intentionaly drive down the price of radiant and ebon crystals in bazaar by setting up a &amp;quot;dummy&amp;quot; sale and other competitions who don't know or check first would try to match or beat prices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I move the crystals and place them in trader bvags, the bazaar do get updated properly.  I still don;t know what triggers this bug because sometimes bazaar uopdates when I claim and sometimes it doesn't.  AFAIK this only applies to crystals and no other items.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt; I am concerned about the long term viability of the everquest virtual world.&lt;br&gt;We are used to seeing unintended changes with every expansion, and the inevitable&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;patch to fix the patch&amp;quot;.  What worries me is that the fundamental playability of&lt;br&gt;the game will become so fragile that future expansions will be impossible.  I began&lt;br&gt;playing in 2003.  With the exception of the DX9 patch, it seems to me that major&lt;br&gt;changes in the game produced an escalating number of bugs as time passed.  I would&lt;br&gt;appreciate the comments of others on their perceptions of this apparent trend. &lt;br&gt;Also any progammers that have insight into keeping an old software growing and&lt;br&gt;functional please contribute.        &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Rationalization of augment types and slots – improvements to set up future itemization</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=212555#M212555</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The augment type and slot system is in need of serious revision and rationalization.  While each individual design decision may have made sense, the resulting set of augments and slots are currently inconsistent between expansions and limit the new itemization designer’s ability to appropriately design certain gear go forward.  The best description I’m aware of for the current slot types and sources of gear with those slots is &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://samanna.net/gen.info/augs.shtml"&gt;http://samanna.net/gen.info/augs.shtml&lt;/a&gt;.  The rest of this discussion pre-supposes the reader is aware of the current slot types and current augments in the game.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I’d propose redesigning the slot types as follows:&lt;br&gt;All/1             Fits anywhere, jack of all trades, limited utility/power.&lt;br&gt;2                 Augments with stacking effect or beyond type 1 in power.&lt;br&gt;3                 Focus/foci and haste (non-stacking effects).&lt;br&gt;4                 Weapons: procs, bane damage, bonus damage.&lt;br&gt;5                 Reserved for future Weapon augments&lt;br&gt;6                 Slot- and diety specific.&lt;br&gt;7                 Base gear slot – variety of augments fit here&lt;br&gt;8                 High-end gear slot – top end raiding augments fit here.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Stacking effects: regeneration, mana regeneration, attack, damage shield, avoidance, accuracy, spell shielding, shielding, stun resistance, strikethrough, combat effects, and dot shielding.&lt;br&gt;Non-stacking effects:  all caster focii, all melee focii, haste, and bard instrument effects. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For purposes of the following table, if an augment has both stacking effects and non-stacking effects, the stacking effects should be disregarded and it should be classified with augments with non-stacking effects.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Conversion of existing augments:&lt;br&gt;Existing augment                             Fits in new slots              Notes&lt;br&gt;Type 1/All                                         Type 1/All                     No change.&lt;br&gt;Type 2                                              Type All                       Upgrade to these augments.&lt;br&gt;Type 3 with stacking effect              Type 2, 7                         &lt;br&gt;Type 3 with non-stacking effect       Type 3, 7                        &lt;br&gt;Type 5                                              Type 4                         Simplification.&lt;br&gt;Type 6                                              Type 4                         Simplification.&lt;br&gt;Type 7 without effect                        Type 7                         No change.&lt;br&gt;Type 7 with stacking effect              Type 2, 7                      Adds type 2 dropped augs.&lt;br&gt;Type 7 with non-stacking effect       Type 3, 7                      Adds type 3 dropped augs.&lt;br&gt;Type 8 without effect                       Type 8                         No change.&lt;br&gt;Type 8 with stacking effect              Type 2, 8                      Adds type 2 dropped augs.&lt;br&gt;Type 8 with non-stacking effect       Type 3, 8                      Adds type 3 dropped augs.&lt;br&gt;Type 7, 8 without effect                   Type 7, 8                      No change.&lt;br&gt;Type 7, 8 with stacking effect          Type 2, 7, 8                 Adds type 2 dropped augs.&lt;br&gt;Type 7, 8 with non-stacking effect   Type 3, 7, 8                 Adds type 3 dropped augs.&lt;br&gt;Type 9                                              Type 2                         Simplification.&lt;br&gt;Type 9, 12                                        Type 2, 3&lt;br&gt;Type 7, 8, 12                                    Type 3, 7, 8&lt;br&gt;Type 11                                            Type 6&lt;br&gt;Type 12                                            Type 3&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Conversion of existing slots&lt;br&gt;Existing slot type            New slot type &lt;br&gt;1                                     1&lt;br&gt;2                                     3&lt;br&gt;3                                     7&lt;br&gt;4                                     4&lt;br&gt;5                                     4&lt;br&gt;6                                     4&lt;br&gt;7                                     7&lt;br&gt;8                                     8&lt;br&gt;9                                     2&lt;br&gt;11                                   6&lt;br&gt;12                                   3&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Exception:&lt;br&gt;If there are 2 type 2 slots on an item, one slot becomes the new type 2 and the other slot becomes the new type 3.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I believe the proposed conversions are backwards compatible.  In other words, each and every revised piece of gear should be capable of holding the augments currently inserted into that piece of gear (after the revision to the augment types).   The only resulting inconsistency with the above proposed framework is I’m having to treat all OoW crafted augments and certain type 9/12 augments as if they had an non-stacking effect in order to allow them to remain in existing cultural armor pieces.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Advantages/disadvantages:&lt;br&gt;The vast majority of the proposed process can be automated.  It should not require significant developer time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Having slot types be expansion dependent is not a good long term use of resources and makes future itemization more difficult.  5 slot types are currently associated exclusively with LDoN – 1,2,3,5 and 6.  1 slot type is strictly associated with DoN vendor armor and augments – 9.  DoN cultural currently uses 2 unique slot types: 11 and 12.  Slot 12 was carried into DoDH and PoR with the addition of the tradeskilled DoDH augments.  While there may have been some valid marketing reasons for how the augment system grew, there is no continuing reason why the existing structure of augment slots should reflect the expansion history so closely.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I very much like the concept of the players being able to significantly customize gear.  I would prefer the players be given the tools to make choices than an itemization designer attempt to make the choices for them. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For example, if the end-zone armor from the next expansion (whenever that is), is fairly basic armor which 5% better than the current GM armor with augment (but excluding mana regen, regeneration or damage shield) and has revised slots 2, 3 and 8 (old 8, 9 and 12), I suspect a number of people will actually get very excited about that armor … as a result of the ability to customize it.  The actual improvement in the base armor would not have to be very big as the additional augment slots enable it to become the newest shiny toy on the block. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The end-zone for expansion after that, it would be time to introduce a new set of top end type 2 augments (with the long term goal of moving the stacking effects off the type 3 augment to the type 2 augment).  The rule of thumb for the new type 2 augments could be that DoN base pieces plus the new augment alone would be somewhere around qvic geared in terms of AC, hp/mana/endurance and total resists. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Whenever the level cap is next increased (or when next appropriate), add a new type 3 customizable foci set of augments with the next level of foci which have no stacking effects but leave the base AC/hp/mana/endurance/statistics and resists roughly equal to the current last blood type levels.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The vision associated with this type of itemization is making Everquest raiding more progressive in nature.  Everything the player needs to get to the top of the leaderboards shouldn’t be available from a single expansion.  The model is one of making the player make some real choices and trade-offs with respect to their gearing choices.  The tools used by the developers would be the statistics on the base piece, the stackable effects on the type 2 augments, the non-stackable foci on the type 3 augments and the type 8 augments.  Each subsequent end zone for future expansions would provide significant upgrades for only one of the four basic pieces and provide fillers pieces equivalent to the upgrades from two expansions prior.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Itemization shouldn’t be starting from a blank slate on each expansion.  Players’ play styles differ and what’s important for them to acquire changes over time depending on what they already have.  Moving towards an unified itemization model which incorporates all the tools available to a developer should minimize the necessity of mudflation across the board and provide a coherent model for itemization go forward.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;br&gt;This would require some developer time.  It would improve some gear from older expansions, including LDoN and DoN (through slot changes).  It is likely to be fairly controversial.  Any time item changes get made, there is a significant risk of errors.  Long term planning of expansion and gear where the augment is an integral part of the equation would actually lead to a step backward in terms of AC, hp and mana on the base gear … but the overall power would increase as the gear got customized.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Msakr on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;04-05-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
