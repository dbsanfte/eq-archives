<DIV>I like the new quest window that logs when you completed one of the 'one-time-only' quests. As a constant quester I think it would be great if Tasks (SIngle or Shared) were also recorded , as well as how many times you attempted and completed it.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>All the quest windows we seem to have now need to be amaligimated. The Task/Quest window, the Journal window and the Adventure Window all serve a similair sort of purpose.</DIV>
<DIV>If all the old repeatable quests could be made into the new style quests (I know this would be a colossal task!) then we would not need the Journal Window.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>If Tasks/Quests were recorded in the same (much more cooler leader-board style) way as the Adventure Window then they could sort of be added together too...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>It would just be nice to see things a bit more integrated, as it is in EQ2.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>EQ2 treated quest items in a different way - in that they didn't take up any inventory space - but I don't think i would like that. I like being able to pick things up and look at them <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-tongue.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0> But seeings as quest items are often little things - perhaps a sort of purse or satchel would be cool for just holding quest items?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>oh - another thing : I like the Tribute Masters alot and am always handing the lassie in Surefall Glade lots of stuff. But it has always bugged me that I get no faction when I hand stuff in. I know you are rewarded in terms of buffs, but you know, you would think the locals would be happy about all this stuff you bring them. I mean - I have a career total of 40k ish, but not a single faction increase? Ungrateful lot <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-tongue.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Also, when I complete a new quest I never seem to get faction from the quest giver. Most of the old style repeatable quests you used to get faction from the quest givers after completion - usually just his local faction(s). But the new quests never seem to give out faction. I did the trade skill quests in North Qeynos - you would think they would be happy I was keeping their sea lanes clear! But I didn't even get a faction increase from the 'Merchants of Qeynos'... its just not joined up thinking if you ask me <img src='/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-tongue.gif' width=16 height=16 border=0></DIV><p>Message Edited by Rostov on <span class=date_text>10-06-2005</span> <span class=time_text>03:03 PM</span>
