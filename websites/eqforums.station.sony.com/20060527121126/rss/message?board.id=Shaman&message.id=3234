&lt;DIV&gt;Wow, I can't believe this still hasn't been answered.&amp;nbsp; I stopped wasting my time on this message board shortly after this was posted.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Its pathetic that it has been 15 weeks and we STILL can't get Brenlo to answer us.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Just because you gave us new stuff with OoW doesn't mean you should ignore this.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;It's now been over two weeks since Brenlo wrote:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0066&gt;&lt;EM&gt;I forwarded the 10 questions along and am awaiting a response.&amp;nbsp; As soon as I have one I will post it.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0066&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Brenlo&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0066&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ff0066&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Brenlo Bixiebopper&lt;BR&gt;Community Relations Manager&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Brenlo - Any update on when we might expect answers from the devs on my "10 questions"?&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Copied here for your convenience.&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;QUESTION #1:&amp;nbsp; Please explain in detail the reasoning behind the "100% / 64% / 47%" ratio for cleric/druid/shaman heals?&amp;nbsp; Also comment on whether this is expected to continue as is?&amp;nbsp; And why is this ratio not also applied to our 10-second "incomplete heal" spells as well?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;QUESTION #2:&amp;nbsp; Please explain the role you expect for shaman to fill in groups fighting mobs which mitigate slows, since the way slow mitigation was implemented decreases our already marginal advantage over other slowing classes?&amp;nbsp; Please explain how you expect shamans to carry out that role (perhaps an example which includes mana spent, time spent, damage mitigated, damage dealt, and so on, along with a situation where we are the best choice class to fill that role)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;QUESTION #3:&amp;nbsp; In a full raid of 72 people, one would expect there to be 4-5 shamans, assuming classes are in balance and about equally represented.&amp;nbsp; What is your vision of what shamans #3, #4, and #5 should be doing on a raid?&amp;nbsp; How is shaman #3-#5 better than having cleric #6,#7,#8 or wizard #6,#7,#8?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;QUESTION #4:&amp;nbsp; If a group already has sufficient healing and a slower, but invites a shaman nevertheless, how much worse is that shaman's target DPS than say adding a wizard?&amp;nbsp; magician?&amp;nbsp; beastlord?&amp;nbsp; paladin?&amp;nbsp; necro?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;QUESTION #5:&amp;nbsp; If stat buffs are supposed to actually do something, please explain to us what going from 250 to 350 in each stat is supposed to do and under what conditions stat buffs should actually be used?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;QUESTION #6:&amp;nbsp; Please tell us why DoTs have gone from being more efficient and yielding more damage than the best nukes in the game&amp;nbsp;to their present state of less damage, more agro, less efficiency, and fights that don't last for their entire duration?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;QUESTION #7:&amp;nbsp; Please tell us under exactly what conditions rabid bear is supposed to be useful?&amp;nbsp; And why its extreme power indicates a base reuse time of 2+ hours.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;QUESTION #8:&amp;nbsp; Please tell us who most of our alchemy made potions are supposed to be used by and under what conditions?&amp;nbsp; The please justify the current prices.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;QUESTION #9:&amp;nbsp; Please tell us why malos has such a large cast/recast&amp;nbsp;tiime, since given that almost none of our spells have innate resist adjustments we're clearly expected to cast it on most mobs before casting damage spells.&amp;nbsp; Most other classes have damage spells with innate resist modifiers, even if they have damage spells with resist adjustments.&amp;nbsp; (See druids with -50 on their much more efficient rain spell&amp;nbsp;despite having a cold debuf spell&amp;nbsp;as an example.)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;QUESTION #10:&amp;nbsp; Please explain why it would be a game altering change to allow shaman pets to have innate SoW?&amp;nbsp; Innate dual wield?&amp;nbsp; Or even why you don't just add an item that summons pet usable junk weapons so we can be spared the frustration of realizing we forgot to restock our backpack full of rusty daggers before crawling all the way to some out of the way GoD zone?&amp;nbsp; While you're at it, explain where our pets are supposed to be in the DPS and surviveability hierarchies of the other pet classes?&amp;nbsp; Are our pets supposed to lose to lower level SK pets?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;A final note to other shamans:&amp;nbsp; please don't post negative stuff on this reminder thread.&amp;nbsp; I'd prefer for the questions to actually be answered.&amp;nbsp; I already know that most of you don't think they will be.&amp;nbsp; No need to post it here :)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If left without other people's follow ups, the original post would now be sitting somewhere in the middle of page 6. What is the farthest back post that Brenlo or one of the developers have responded to? Do posts like this receive higher priority at SoE if they are ignored by the community for 5 months? Can we get some insight regarding how long a post has to sit stagnant before it gets some attention at SoE? Some people may have been posting follow ups to this in the misguided attempt to try to bring it to the attention of people at SoE. Has that been the wrong tactic to take? What coarse of action do you recommend we take to try to get some answers here?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Also, in looking Brenlo's post regarding the rules for posting, the closest one I could find is&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
brenlo&amp;nbsp;wrote (at &lt;A href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Shaman&amp;amp;message.id=656" target=_blank&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Shaman&amp;amp;message.id=656&lt;/A&gt;):&lt;BR&gt;Monopolize the front page of any forum by "bumping" threads of the same or similar content to the front. We may intervene by closing threads any time that this occurs. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;I'm not sure if it's user settable, but my forum browser webpage shows the 30 most recently posted to threads. Are there other posts with the same or similar content as this one? Does this post and those other posts run the risk of monopolizing the 30 available forum slots? Should we try to coalesce this thread with these other threads that are also being bumped up and monopolizing the front page? It is not my intent to monopolize the front page with posts about trying to get these questions answered. But, posting follow up comments and such to this thread so far has been the only vehicle available to me so far. What is the recommended (and non rule breaking) way to try to get those answers?&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;Face it SOE does not care about Shaman issues. From what I have read, the new DoD spells are not even worth the effort to get. I was so hopeing that Shaman would finally get a group 60% haste spell. We already have the 60% single haste, so this is not unbalancing. I'm very disappointed. Shaman on my server are becoming very scarce . On raids I am often the only Shaman, which is frustrating. The only good thing about this is I don't have trouble gettings groups because there are no other Shaman LFG half the time.&amp;nbsp; SOE needs to look at this concerns and address them now.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;No, this is just proof that whoever samana asked about it is a doofus.&amp;nbsp; The question compares DoTs versus nukes as they were several years ago to DoTs versus nukes today.&amp;nbsp; It asks a fundamental question about DoT versus Nuke balance.&amp;nbsp; The question was written BEFORE the most recent DoT revamps.&amp;nbsp; The question the dev "answered" (actually just blew off if you read it carefully) is a request for an explanation of the most recent DoT changes.&amp;nbsp; None of which change the fundamental dot / nuke tradeoff as it currently exists or even tries to justify it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;All that developer answer does is basically duck the question entirely and insulted the person who asked it by not taking it seriously.&amp;nbsp; Whatever jerk answered that question just proves that they don't know thing one about customer service.&amp;nbsp; Laughing at your customers and telling them to quit wasting your time is about what I've come to expect from this crowd though, so I'm no longer shocked by that sort of thing or the complete ignoring of this thread and its predecesors.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;As for disease dots, the dev could only find the question amusing if he has a FUNDAMENTAL misunderstanding of the game.&amp;nbsp; What kind of moron would think a minor increase in DPS for disease DoTs at the expense of mana efficiency was a useful change for grouping?&amp;nbsp; Seriously, when was the last time you cast a disease dot in a group?&amp;nbsp; Maybe if you have clicky pox pants and still wear them.&amp;nbsp; (The changes to Pox were excellent actually)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But no, the non-answer to the disease dot question has nothing to do with the question I was asking.&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The most recent expansion?&amp;nbsp; I don't have it either.&amp;nbsp; But from what I've read, the new spells are:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- a short duration (4.2 minutes) buff that gives someone a chance to proc a 25% slow when they get hit &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- a new short duration (1 minute) disease slow (40%, -50 resist adj) that has a chance to go from mob to mob&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;- a new AE poison "cone of cold" shaped poison nuke with a long recast delay and no resist adjustment&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;None of those appear to address anything I'd consider a core shaman issue.&amp;nbsp; Most shamans who've tried them seem to&amp;nbsp;feel that&amp;nbsp;they're crap.&amp;nbsp; Though some were amused by the bugged version of the slow proc that was making hits versus the buffed target hit for 8000% extra damage or something.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;In any case, the 10 questions were motivated by a desire to understand what motivates the devs to do what they do, not to be an "alternate top 10 upgrades" request.&amp;nbsp; Nothing that was released with the expansion even attempted to improve communication with us that answers to questions like these would provide.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Also, it was motivated by Brenlo's snide "ask constructive questions and then maybe I'll give you some answers" sort of comment on another thread in response to someone else's post.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;Well, since you resurrected the thread, perhaps a comment would be useful:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;These questions were asked about 18 months ago.&amp;nbsp;Despite a promise by our community relations manager to obtain answers, we're still waiting.&amp;nbsp; And as you've noted, they ignored them for so long that a bunch of em really aren't that relevent anymore.&amp;nbsp; That's actually&amp;nbsp;the point I was making on this thread&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;QUESTION #1:&amp;nbsp; Please explain in detail the reasoning behind the "100% / 64% / 47%" ratio for cleric/druid/shaman heals?&amp;nbsp; Also comment on whether this is expected to continue as is?&amp;nbsp; And why is this ratio not also applied to our 10-second "incomplete heal" spells as well?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The ratios are now:&amp;nbsp; "100% / 75% / 65%".&amp;nbsp; Certainly a dramatic improvement for shamans.&amp;nbsp; But we still do not have an explanation regarding the reasoning for why this ratio is what it is.&amp;nbsp; Now, if our 10-second heal followed this same ratio, it would heal for 4875 hp and actually be usable rather than laughed at and dumped on page 50 of the spellbook to gather dust.&amp;nbsp; In my opinion, this question, updated with the more recent ratios, is still fairly interesting.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;QUESTION #2:&amp;nbsp; Please explain the role you expect for shaman to fill in groups fighting mobs which mitigate slows, since the way slow mitigation was implemented decreases our already marginal advantage over other slowing classes?&amp;nbsp; Please explain how you expect shamans to carry out that role (perhaps an example which includes mana spent, time spent, damage mitigated, damage dealt, and so on, along with a situation where we are the best choice class to fill that role)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Still seems like a moderately interesting question.&amp;nbsp; They've mitigated slows and then made resist-adjusted slows available to the other slowing classes.&amp;nbsp; As time goes on, slows continue their trend of becoming interchangeable.&amp;nbsp; This is clearly good for other classes when they want to make groups, since they can just grab whichever "slower" says yes first.&amp;nbsp; But it's actually gotten to the point where slows are very heavily mitigated in some content.&amp;nbsp; In that content, a second healer can heal back more damage versus an unslowed mob than our slows prevent.&amp;nbsp; In other words, they've effectively made it so that 6 classes can fill that one group slot (shm, enc, bst, brd, dru, cle) once slows are heavily mitigated.&amp;nbsp; This is my analysis of the situation.&amp;nbsp; Still would be nice to hear the answer from the people who actually control these class balance issues.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;QUESTION #3:&amp;nbsp; In a full raid of 72 people, one would expect there to be 4-5 shamans, assuming classes are in balance and about equally represented.&amp;nbsp; What is your vision of what shamans #3, #4, and #5 should be doing on a raid?&amp;nbsp; How is shaman #3-#5 better than having cleric #6,#7,#8 or wizard #6,#7,#8?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Maybe current&amp;nbsp;end game raids have something useful for the Nth shaman to do, but most of the raids through PoTime do not.&amp;nbsp; In most of those raids that I've attended, the raid would have been much better off with an extra cleric.&amp;nbsp; Again, this was written from the point of view of the "average" raid scene 18 months ago.&amp;nbsp; Not today's.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;QUESTION #4:&amp;nbsp; If a group already has sufficient healing and a slower, but invites a shaman nevertheless, how much worse is that shaman's target DPS than say adding a wizard?&amp;nbsp; magician?&amp;nbsp; beastlord?&amp;nbsp; paladin?&amp;nbsp; necro?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This is still a perfectly valid question.&amp;nbsp; What exactly is our target DPS&amp;nbsp;relative to other classes&amp;nbsp;when doing nothing else?&amp;nbsp; Anecdotal claims that one shaman in one situation can achieve a peak of some large amount of DoT damage for a single tick doesn't really answer the question.&amp;nbsp; Nor does hand-wavy discussions of panther.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;QUESTION #5:&amp;nbsp; If stat buffs are supposed to actually do something, please explain to us what going from 250 to 350 in each stat is supposed to do and under what conditions stat buffs should actually be used?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This is also still a fairly valid question for many shamans.&amp;nbsp; Not everyone has the level 66+ buffs that have non-stat increases.&amp;nbsp; There are still some people playing at lower levels.&amp;nbsp; And there are still some few people whose stats aren't maxed out.&amp;nbsp; Understanding what the stats are really supposed to do would still be useful.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;QUESTION #6:&amp;nbsp; Please tell us why DoTs have gone from being more efficient and yielding more damage than the best nukes in the game&amp;nbsp;to their present state of less damage, more agro, less efficiency, and fights that don't last for their entire duration?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This is still a very valid question.&amp;nbsp; The previous responder clearly didn't bother doing his homework if he thinks i'm comparing unfocussed to focussed or whatnot.&amp;nbsp; Looking at just raw lucy numbers:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Sisslak = 578 * 5 = 2890 dmg for 609 mana (4.75 dmg/mana).&amp;nbsp; Gelidan Comet = 3385 for 650 mana (5.2 dmg/mana).&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Back in the old days, our DoTs were more mana efficient and did more total damage than the best nukes in the game.&amp;nbsp; It just took longer.&amp;nbsp; Now they are less mana efficient and do less damage.&amp;nbsp; The question is quite valid.&amp;nbsp; Also, even our curse DoTs are not fast enough to finish in a lot of content, so become even less mana efficient and do less total dmg.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;QUESTION #7:&amp;nbsp; Please tell us under exactly what conditions rabid bear is supposed to be useful?&amp;nbsp; And why its extreme power indicates a base reuse time of 2+ hours.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This AA is still a pointless toy.&amp;nbsp; We could have it on 100% of the time and still would suck at melee.&amp;nbsp; I'd like an explanation of why such a piece of crap is cluttering up my AA choices rather than something that's actually useful.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;QUESTION #8:&amp;nbsp; Please tell us who most of our alchemy made potions are supposed to be used by and under what conditions?&amp;nbsp; The please justify the current prices.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also still a perfectly valid question.&amp;nbsp; Why waste developer effort enhancing a skill that produces mostly useless crap.&amp;nbsp; Yes, it applies to a lot of trade skills, but the question is still valid regarding alchemy in particular.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;QUESTION #9:&amp;nbsp; Please tell us why malos has such a large cast/recast&amp;nbsp;tiime, since given that almost none of our spells have innate resist adjustments we're clearly expected to cast it on most mobs before casting damage spells.&amp;nbsp; Most other classes have damage spells with innate resist modifiers, even if they have damage spells with resist adjustments.&amp;nbsp; (See druids with -50 on their much more efficient rain spell&amp;nbsp;despite having a cold debuf spell&amp;nbsp;as an example.)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;This is also still a very valid question.&amp;nbsp; And as I said 18 months ago, I don't really much care about the anecdotal opinion of some random person.&amp;nbsp; These questions are for the devs.&amp;nbsp; Brenlo claimed he would get us answers.&amp;nbsp; Still waiting....&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#33cc00&gt;QUESTION #10:&amp;nbsp; Please explain why it would be a game altering change to allow shaman pets to have innate SoW?&amp;nbsp; Innate dual wield?&amp;nbsp; Or even why you don't just add an item that summons pet usable junk weapons so we can be spared the frustration of realizing we forgot to restock our backpack full of rusty daggers before crawling all the way to some out of the way GoD zone?&amp;nbsp; While you're at it, explain where our pets are supposed to be in the DPS and surviveability hierarchies of the other pet classes?&amp;nbsp; Are our pets supposed to lose to lower level SK pets?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The dual wield part of this is now irrelevent.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; But where our pet is supposed to be in terms of dps and survivability is still a perfectly interesting and valid question.&amp;nbsp; Our AAs are cluttered up with marginally useful pet AA, sort of implying we're a pet class, but then we don't have access to pet focus items.&amp;nbsp; It's all very confusing.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;If I were to write a new "10 questions" list, these might not be them, but they're not that far off.&amp;nbsp; But I'm unlikely to bother given that these haven't even had a whiff of an answer in over a year from anyone other than random people who are bored and either happy or disgruntled, but either way totally biased.&amp;nbsp; The unbiased dev answer would be a lot more enlightening.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by GlowingRune on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;08-24-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;01:02 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Not to detract from the argument, but according to my parses, our 30sec magic dots do 6 sets of damage without focus, which evens this comparison up a bit.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;When you add in focuses, there is also an additional benefit for DoT's.&amp;nbsp; Burning Affliction is pretty much the same as Improved Damage and we can both have the same mana preservation.&amp;nbsp; But there is also the Affliction Efficiency focus AND the extended dot duration focus that make the comparison more favourable for Shaman.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;The problem is that out dots rarely run full duration on average mobs when fighting with a group.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;But, if you're comparing with a wizard then you should also take account of our pet (however weak, it still contributes) and our own ability to melee.&amp;nbsp; Whilst many don't bother with these options particularly against high damage mobs they can both add to our dps (I personally have 2 weapon procs that add a decent amount even in a short melee).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I was merely comparing DoTs vs Nukes today with DoTs vs Nukes in the past.&amp;nbsp; In the past, the raw numbers on DoTs provided higher total damage and more mana efficiency than the comparable nukes.&amp;nbsp; Today they do not.&amp;nbsp; I am not particularly interested in comparing shaman dps to wizard dps.&amp;nbsp; Only to understand why DoTs have been weakened in the applicability&amp;nbsp;to shorter fights and in their raw numbers.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;If the answer is that they intended for DoTs to be worse in every way than comparable nukes, except for people who've spent about 50aa and collected an array of high end foci, so be it.&amp;nbsp; But I want the question answered by the devs, rather than by our own speculation.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Because they may not even have particularly noticed that their changes have made this balance change.&amp;nbsp; They seem to mindlessly apply a "add a certain percentage to the dmg and mana costs" upgrade template every release.&amp;nbsp; If the percentages aren't quite right, it might take several releases for the balance shift to become really noticeable.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by GlowingRune on &lt;span class=date_text&gt;09-07-2005&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=time_text&gt;12:58 PM&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <description>Figuring that the staff won't answer for the next few years anyway, here's my take.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; QUESTION #1:  Heal spells&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forget the 10 sec heal really fast. It's a relic from old content.&lt;br&gt;With shaman heals I duoed a slightly slowable and 2500 hitting mob (Yes, I used mana and AA heal, ward - whatever) so they can't be as broken as you make them sound.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; QUESTION #3:  Shaman vs clerics on raids&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, 2-3 shaman can easily handle buffs/debuffs for a full raid but having more doesn't hurt at all. Raid content often requires cures or heals other than just healing one MT. Shamans do that very well.Shamans are also pretty flexible for damaging a raid mob. Counting melee (including panther) as one, that's 5 colours of magic to use for damaging a mob. So what if Ture can only really be hurt with disease spells? You stack 4 of those while keeping your group cured/alive...&lt;br&gt;If you want to be the outstanding hero - don't raid. Raids need troopers more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; QUESTION #4:  Shaman dps&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is just ONE parse but when I was trying out what DoTs could do, I was duoing 2 cleric mobs with a warrior. I did 3k / tick in DOT damage (plus pet) although I'll admit that took a bit to get them all on.&lt;br&gt;For groups, Panther or magic DOT is the way to go or even nukes if your group is even faster than those.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; QUESTION #5:  If stat buffs are supposed to actually do something&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;... they are not. They make shamans feel important or somesuch.&lt;br&gt;Shamans now got Avoidance and Melee Damage buffs instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; QUESTION #6:  DoT efficiency&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Curse hits for 1000 average for 6000 total. With a 578 base cost (minus conservation / spec) that is dirt cheap. And that is nothing situational but our fastest and hardest hitting DOT so what was your question again?&lt;br&gt;Spell foci? Sure I have them. Just dont compare unfocused DOTs to focused wizzie nukes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; QUESTION #7:  Rabid Bear&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Woo! Fun skill but... hahahahahaha!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; QUESTION #8:  Please tell us who most of our alchemy made potions are supposed to be used by&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trade skills are a money sink. As long as pp is burned  to skill up and create potions, the trade skill works.&lt;br&gt;Only recently the 350+ trivial GM Armour became an actual alternative - at least for twinks and casual players. Elemental level gear (+ crystals for the DON augs) bought in the bazaar!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; QUESTION #9:  Please tell us why malos has such a large cast/recast tiime&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Easy. It is unresistable PLUS has negligible aggro.&lt;br&gt;Only a long recast time can realistically balance such a powerful spell.&lt;br&gt;Enchanters have no recast time on Tash but pay for it with heavy aggro. Always a price.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; QUESTION #10:  Pet dual wield / innate SoW&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DW: fixed for all pets. Level 29+ pets, wasn't it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And innate SoW: What's the point? If you DO buff your pet that's just one more super cheap spell. If you dont buff the mutt you may as well call it Dogmeat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sure shamans are seriously troubled but the most DIRE concern seems to be whether Rabid Bear is highly useful or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As always - feel free to disagree. Then I'll rip ya arms off an eat em.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=767322 target=_blank&gt;Gazz, Troll &lt;/a&gt; Got cheese?</description>

      <description>Actually, it's almost been 10 months. SoE (Kytherea) has had a couple responses here. First she said that just because brenlo is ignoring us doesn't mean that he is too busy. Then she said that if someone bumps this thread that she would lock it. Then she said that brenlo out for a week or two for thanksgiving and some sort of emergency. Then she said that she forwared the questions again to Brenlo, but neither she nor brenlo have the power to get answers from the developers. But we haven't heard anything from them since December. Maybe they just want to demonstrate that they're not 'too busy'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had hoped that John Smedley's promotion of Alan Crosby to Director of Community Relations ("specifically to prioritize [us]") would have been some kind of structral change that would allow Kytherea/Ashlanne/Brenlo the kind of clout needed to be able to get some kind of response back from the developers. So far, it does not appear as though this is the case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, please do not start discussing Panther/Leopard stuff here. I suspect that SoE has a bot that automatically locks any thread that mentions it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an aside, I just noticed a 'Report Abuse to a Moderator' button in the lower left hand corner of peoples messages. I wonder if we can report developer abuse by clicking it.</description>

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;I've just sat for quite a while reading this thread.&amp;nbsp; I have to say "yes and amen" to many of the issues.&amp;nbsp; In truth, I'm surprized that nobody has brought up the inequities we have with Beastlords.&amp;nbsp; I don't think this is really a separate issues than the rest of this thread since observing the BST class just highlights how long its been for our issues to be addressed.&amp;nbsp; Yes I know our pets finally got DW and don't need weapons to do so, but other pets have been there for a long time already.&amp;nbsp; Aren't Beastlords supposed to be a hybrid of shaman and monk?&amp;nbsp; If so, then perhaps they shouldn't be so close to us in shaman-like ability levels.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;My shaman has many times felt useless in groups/raids when the pulling beastlord tells me not to worry about buffing him or slowing because he's &lt;EM&gt;got it covered&lt;/EM&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Many of the beastlord spells equal or rival ours.&amp;nbsp; The ones that are lower are not that much lower.&amp;nbsp; Just seems wrong that a shaman is deemed of little use when grouping with a beastlord who is just a few levels higher, since&amp;nbsp;so many&amp;nbsp;spells are dupicated.&amp;nbsp; If they are supposed to be a hybrid, how come they possess so many kinds of spells that shamans don't have at all?....exp Beast crack.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If the answer is that they aren't actually a shaman hybrid, then it's still just one more class that has our abilities and make us less balanced in the realm of class usefulness.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I also want to say that with the April 12 patch, I was unimpressed by the improvements for our class.&amp;nbsp; Then further, the EQ Live developers message talks about near future&amp;nbsp;improvements to&amp;nbsp;many classes.&amp;nbsp; They want to add bigger better heals for all the healing classes, and envision druids and shamans being able to "main heal" when there is no cleric.&amp;nbsp; This brought up the issue of druids being overpowering, so they said they would consider having druids decide to instance themselves as a MH for that group, resulting in 25% better heal for the time and 25% less spell dmg.&amp;nbsp; The opposite would happen if they chose at that time to play as a dmg druid.&amp;nbsp; They added that they wanted to do the same for Shamans, but our ability to slow makes&amp;nbsp;SOE hesitant to deal with us much.&amp;nbsp; So many other classes are getting these great changes and mods and they basically left us with nothing....again.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I tried to find the post again so I could quote it.&amp;nbsp; Having trouble.&amp;nbsp; Has anyone else seen that post and wish to mention where?&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;DIV&gt;With the introduction of Leopard/Panther SoE has done a great job in providing a solution to a lot of our problems and has done it in a way that is fun for not only shaman but others.&amp;nbsp; Cast it on clerics and other casters and they have a blast getting to melee and actually doing damage.&amp;nbsp; Way to go devs and thanks a lot.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
