				With the right AAs and the Pet Focus items, your pet can still handle some heavy damage. Mine can take for me in a pinch still at 65, and he regens like some kind of Fungi Monster. 6-7% a /tick/. As soon as I get Pet Discipline, he'll be able to tank most exp mobs indefinately. For those unfamiliar with the trick... You set your pet on a mob, and let him hit it and hopefully taunt and proc a time or two. Then you use '/pet hold'. If he's a focussed pet, he's now regenning faster than most exp mobs can damage him, so he can just sit there and keep the mob's attention until you're ready to kill it.

				<DIV>In&nbsp;GoD our pets are tiny, insignificant speed bumps. D:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I blow away my pet's dps and did so before I entered the Elemental Planes and Time.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>So it depends on the level of play you are at. In Normal LDON&nbsp;our pets can easily off tank. In Hard LDON they're not very good.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>We get no AA's or Foci that help our pet's defensive abilities. The DPOC focus from LDON merchants provides an awesome regen effect to our pet when they are not in combat.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I can't imagine using Rorith's tactics, that certainly isn't the most efficient way to solo, which is the only time you'd use it. Certainly not in off-tank situations where you need your pet to get and maintain agro.</DIV>

<P>I could&nbsp;see this tactic being more useful for folks whose pet is actually the better tank.

With a couple HP buffs, or some extra spell regen, this can be more than enough to hold up under a lot of attacks. (Admittedly, it probably couldn't handle 900+ hits or anything insane like that, but if you need to park some trash mob out of the way for a while, this is a great trick.)
