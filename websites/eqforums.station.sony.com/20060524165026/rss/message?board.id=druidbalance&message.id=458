      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;The concern with charm had nothing to do with the cast time - it had 2 components:&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;1) Too many animals are tagged uncharmable.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;2) The level cap should be raised to at least 62 to bring it in line with other classes charm spells.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;DIV&gt;The wolf form thing really needs to be removed from our list of concerns. It has both beneficial and negative ones and I don't think they would remove just the negative ones.

&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Then bring other illusions in line with wolf form. It's bad enough that I get attacked using wolf form on quest npc's only because of the illusion but to have a shaman bear form, enchanter scarcrow form, or necro undead form not kos has always been a slap in the face to me. Some of those spells use to be kos, though the bear form never has been, but was changed to not impact faction. I can only see druids wanting to keep this so they can PL low level twinks in zones like Unrest.&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;

      <description>However Borble, wolf form is KOS everywhere that a high level druid is playing. It is completely and utterly unsafe to use always. In my opinion (and a lot of others), it does need to be adjusted.&#xD;

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Gonna do some clarifications of these items (my view anyway). I am not sure I agree with the relative ranking of this list. There are raid druids, group druids, and solo druids. You will find it hard to please all these groups. For referenc, I am a wood-elf druid born on Vallon Zek but now I reside on Stormhammer. I am part of an EP raiding guild.&amp;nbsp; Here are my clarifications:&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Improve our healing abilities&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;Not sure what kind of improvements have been suggested, but I am fairly happy with the healing power of our spells and aas. We are clearly the second best "direct" heal class. Shammies are probably equal in healing power with a slightly different slant to what they do. I see some room for improvement in healing spell mana costs and/or adding some group heal ability, but that is it.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;SoTW reuse timer change to 15 min&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;Honestly, I am not interested in this. 22 minutes vs 15 minutes, not a huge deal for what SoTW was intended for. Now, if you are a druid thinking this is your group heal spell, then yeah, 22 minutes is a long time to wait. The suggestion I have here is to create a new and different group heal that has a faster refresh.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Group heal spell line &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;This would be cool, but I don't want to dilute the druid abilities with another's class defining ability (Pally). Perhaps it would be more of a group regen/cure type spell/ability.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Fix resists on E'ci's Frosty Breath to be similar to Hand of Ro&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;All I have to say is, OMG, yes please. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Some kind of reincarnate/revive/summon person ability that summons a person to their corpse&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;I completely disagree with this. It is not appropriate from the role-playing aspects of a druid. What I would like to see, however, is a complimentary ability to the cleric's rez. I am thinking of a "Nature's Rejuvination" where rez effects are removed and mana and health regen to restore a recently rezzed toon to a healthy state. This could be a mgb'able group ability.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Improve bear pet (stronger, better, more useful like wiz familiar, maybe resist AE, add dual wield)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;I think that "improve" is the wrong word. "Redefine" would be more appropriate. I would focus on having the bear be more like the familiar rather than making it more pet like. Do away with the "tease" of booboo the pet and replace him with a line of nature's warders (wizzy familiars of the pure and unsullied tunare kind).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;More shape changing forms and ideally special abilities for each&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;I totally agree with this. This is a really rich area for creativity with the class. There have been sooo sooo many suggestions on the boards about what could be done with illusions. I would consider stripping wolf form from druids completely and letting that be a ranger specific illusion. Completely overhaul our natural/illusional forms.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Remove faction hits from wolf form line&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;I don't know about "removing" faction hits, but just let wolf form be treated the way it originally was. Why is it that everyone on the moon hates wolves? Isn't there an affinity for wolves and the moon ;-). I know I would use wolf form again if it created neutral or at least non-KOS faction.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Improve Treeform line (ex: movement, better stats, better mana regen, useable in at least every zone with trees, is seen by npcs as a tree not a pc,etc)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;Similar to above statements about illusion form, yes please.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Regen spell line boosted especially at high levels&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;AAs that bost regen abilities would be cool. Also a group heal/regen that cured diseases and/or curses would be appropriate.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;More aggro reduction ability and/or less aggro generated from our spells &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;I would rather see tailorable aggro generation. Those folks who desire less could achieve less and those that desire more could achieve that as well.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;A better high level harmony that is more like original harmony&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;Honestly, harmony should be nerfed further.

&lt;P&gt;Improve our healing abilities&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;Not sure what kind of improvements have been suggested, but I am fairly happy with the healing power of our spells and aas. We are clearly the second best "direct" heal class. Shammies are probably equal in healing power with a slightly different slant to what they do. I see some room for improvement in healing spell mana costs and/or adding some group heal ability, but that is it.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0033&gt;Well unlike the bulk of us you obviously never MH for mid/high GoD expedition and LDON hard groups where you will find SI underpowered, KR too slow and inefficient,&amp;nbsp; and no way to group heal most of the time if multiple members of your party are dying which brings us to....&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;SoTW reuse timer change to 15 min&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;Honestly, I am not interested in this. 22 minutes vs 15 minutes, not a huge deal for what SoTW was intended for. Now, if you are a druid thinking this is your group heal spell, then yeah, 22 minutes is a long time to wait. The suggestion I have here is to create a new and different group heal that has a faster refresh.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0033&gt;Again SoTW should have a base 15min timer which can be reduced to 7-10 using AAs - its our only recourse to heal multiple members of the party from AE or add aggro - I'm sick of having to let my CC or slower die cause of having to chain heal the MA.&amp;nbsp; Even if you're a "raiding druid" and not a "grouping druid" SoTW is critical for keeping raids up against boss AEs - its one of our most valuable abilities in every setting and is our only real "super-fast, low aggro" heal.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Group heal spell line &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;This would be cool, but I don't want to dilute the druid abilities with another's class defining ability (Pally). Perhaps it would be more of a group regen/cure type spell/ability.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0000&gt;Oh you see group heals as a Pally class-defining ability - not like ports, or&amp;nbsp; snares, or harmony, or run speed or regen or any of the class-defining abilities we once had ... group heals are a necessity for all the reasons indicated above for SoTW although I support both possible solutions: the addition of a new group heal or the lowering of SoTW's timer considerably.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Fix resists on E'ci's Frosty Breath to be similar to Hand of Ro&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;All I have to say is, OMG, yes please. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0000&gt;Ok this is a no brainer for everyone...&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Some kind of reincarnate/revive/summon person ability that summons a person to their corpse&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;I completely disagree with this. It is not appropriate from the role-playing aspects of a druid. What I would like to see, however, is a complimentary ability to the cleric's rez. I am thinking of a "Nature's Rejuvination" where rez effects are removed and mana and health regen to restore a recently rezzed toon to a healthy state. This could be a mgb'able group ability.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0033&gt;Hmm you really play a druid?&amp;nbsp; The ability you describe "Natures Rejuv" would be interesting but is &lt;STRONG&gt;totally irrelevant&lt;/STRONG&gt; to why we need a rez/recall - again the whole points is for GoD and LDON groups to have a reasonably equivalent chance of success with a druid or cleric as healer - that doesnt mean druids need to be as good healers as clerics but the overall effect of making a druid your MH shouldn't be a dramatically decreased chance of winning.&amp;nbsp; If anyone dies in LDON and no one has rez/recall its a major time sink at best - in GoD its a game ender - many groups won't do either without a cleric for that reason - we need a recall or rez so&amp;nbsp; we can get bring people back to the adventure in some way.&amp;nbsp; Is it really that out of our "masters of nature" milieu to imagine a druid summoning a spirit back to its corpse laying there on the ground?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Improve bear pet (stronger, better, more useful like wiz familiar, maybe resist AE, add dual wield)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;I think that "improve" is the wrong word. "Redefine" would be more appropriate. I would focus on having the bear be more like the familiar rather than making it more pet like. Do away with the "tease" of booboo the pet and replace him with a line of nature's warders (wizzy familiars of the pure and unsullied tunare kind).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0000&gt;I donno - either booboo is just a toy or he's a focus pet .... VI/SoE has always maintained he's just a toy...&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;More shape changing forms and ideally special abilities for each&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;I totally agree with this. This is a really rich area for creativity with the class. There have been sooo sooo many suggestions on the boards about what could be done with illusions. I would consider stripping wolf form from druids completely and letting that be a ranger specific illusion. Completely overhaul our natural/illusional forms.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0000&gt;That part about erasing wolf forms and replacing them with a whole line of new forms is special .... the chances of that kind of development time being put into any EQ-I project are 0.&amp;nbsp; More useful illusions or making treeform into something useful would help.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Remove faction hits from wolf form line&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;I don't know about "removing" faction hits, but just let wolf form be treated the way it originally was. Why is it that everyone on the moon hates wolves? Isn't there an affinity for wolves and the moon ;-). I know I would use wolf form again if it created neutral or at least non-KOS faction.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0033&gt;Agree.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Improve Treeform line (ex: movement, better stats, better mana regen, useable in at least every zone with trees, is seen by npcs as a tree not a pc,etc)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;Similar to above statements about illusion form, yes please.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0033&gt;Agree.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Regen spell line boosted especially at high levels&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;AAs that bost regen abilities would be cool. Also a group heal/regen that cured diseases and/or curses would be appropriate.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0033&gt;AAs which boost regen would be nice - a better use for nature's boon AA maybe - the cureing thing... uh have you heard of Radiant Cure?&amp;nbsp; and a regen cure wouldn't really work with the way counters are implemented.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;More aggro reduction ability and/or less aggro generated from our spells &lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;I would rather see tailorable aggro generation. Those folks who desire less could achieve less and those that desire more could achieve that as well.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0033&gt;You heal - our heals suck - you have to chain cast them - you can out-taunt a 65(300) warrior - end of story.&amp;nbsp; SCS III allows you to live approximately 20% longer..... this is one of the biggest needs of high-end druids...&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;A better high level harmony that is more like original harmony&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;Honestly, harmony should be nerfed further. Druids should have a calm for plants/animals, but not for all npcs. Perhaps ours could be stronger for those limited mobs they affect, but this should not be a class defining ability. A animal/plant mez/mem blur would be a nice addition.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0033&gt;Silly cleric - you bought a druid account just so you could post on these boards and thought we wouldn't notice - tsk tsk - harmony was the last class-defining and valuable abilities we had left before it was nerfed - it allowed us to fill the "puller" role in outdoor zones.&amp;nbsp; Now almost all zones are indoor - clerics?!?! and enchanters have paci - and we have a harmony that isn't even reliable outdoors .... thats just wrong...&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Faster movement spell (SoW or Wolfform lines or AAXP Wolfform)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;Interesting and a good area for role-playing appropriate improvements.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0033&gt;How about not having 90% of the 55+ animals in the game tagged uncharmable.&amp;nbsp; And having our charm cap at the same level as Necro's and Mage's.&amp;nbsp; And making DCed pets summonable with summon companion.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;New ports, especially to unused druid circles&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;Over time, wizzies and especially druids have been nerfed with the introduction of PoP and LDoN ports.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0033&gt;Yes more useless enhancements please.&amp;nbsp; One thing I always found insulting though - as masters of nature isn't it a little weird we can't port to &lt;STRONG&gt;the Plane of Sky&lt;/STRONG&gt;?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0033&gt;Well Mr. Cleric there are in fact plants that can be charmed and even a druid spell for charming them - not that you'd know - but it needs to be made upgradeable through a follow-on quest to have a CoT-like level cap and trees and cactii etc in PoP should be tagged charmable.&lt;/FONT&gt;.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;The biggest improvement to our healings they could do would be to lower our agro on it or give us another agro reducing aa. Frankly im tired of catching agro and dying off after the first heal.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Group heals are about as much of a "necessity" as slow would be. Right now Pally's have a very nice nitch in groups and raids with the group heals. backed with the cleric aa ability to even out hp it allows them to stack very well together. I have no interest whatsoever in receaving a group heal. I have enough agro problems with our single heal let alone trying to use a group one. Let the class that can take a beating be the one casting the group heal. If your getting pounded on that bad in a group maybe you should have a talk with your group memebers about holding agro.&amp;nbsp;The only time I have ever seen a use for a group heal is on raids and if your guild/pickup raid doesnt have any Pally's then maybe they should add one or two. If your talking about it solely for hard adventures/missions then maybe you should add a 2nd healer or setup who will be healing who from the start. I reallly cant stress enough how this skill, while useful, is better left to other classes. If people really feel another class needs it give it to the shaman and make our fast heals faster and less agro.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0000&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;Remove faction hits from wolf form line&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;I don't know about "removing" faction hits, but just let wolf form be treated the way it originally was. Why is it that everyone on the moon hates wolves? Isn't there an affinity for wolves and the moon ;-). I know I would use wolf form again if it created neutral or at least non-KOS faction.&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0033&gt;Agree.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Thats because wolf form was WAY overpowered by making use nutral faction regardless of normal faction. If you don't understand this then simply walk into unrest, cast wolf form, and go walking around chatting with the undead. Go sit with them. pull the dwarf ghost from the basement up to the zone in.. whatever. If you still don't see how the original faction bonus to it was overpowered then hit yourself on the head with a hammer a few times. Eventually youll come to see that any spell that lets you ignore agro all the time is vastly too powerfull. This should be changed to give no faction hits much like the rest of the illusions currently are but in no way should it go back to the way it was in 99.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;I agree here that there is absolutly no reason to nerf harmony further. It was overpowered though for such a low level spell. Unless you are speaking of zones like Cazic where mobs are uneffected by harmony then I have no idea how you find harmony not reliable. I have never had any&amp;nbsp;kind of a resist except for those mobs I have run across as being uneffected. Maybe there are some in the elementals that would make harmonly not usefull for a druid to pull with. For as far as raiding content is conserened I tend to leave the pulling to the classes that have that job, ie monks and bards, and therefore really see this as very low importance. Should less mobs be out and out immune to this? Sure. But the same should be said for root/snare as well. Immunities should be left to those powerful npc's like gods not green con yard trash.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0033&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;Indoor harmony/pacify ability&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;Disagree completely.&lt;/FONT&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#cc0033&gt;Of course you do because you're not a druid....&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;I guess I'm not a druid as I also disagree completely. Though since im 65 with almost 300 aa and have been playing one since 99 maybe you can sign into TM and tell me, and my guild, what class I am playing. I'm sure we all would be very happy to find out what that is. Maybe I'm an illusionist.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;I think he means more like there isn't anything to charm at 65 with the low level plant charm. Ether way this is one of those things that should be pushed to the very bottom of the list. You have frogs that you can charm to solo you really don't need anything else. Charm is by far the most unbalancing spell in the game currently. Playing with this is just going to triv content much greater. I've already seen chanter pets tank named in GoD with ease.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>I pretty much agree with what you are saying Ankara. I also don't want wolf form to be treated like it is in the "old world". I just don't want it to have a KoS faction adjustment in all the "new world" content. Can it just do nothing? That is really what I would like.&#xD;

      <description>&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;I guess todays big 'ol druids don't remember that wolf form makes a druid non-kos to brownies and griffs (just to name 2 for you) It's a milestone to gain lvl 24 and the first wolf form, least for my druids it was a milestone,&amp;nbsp;as I hunted at low levels in scary places like lesser forrest.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;I did notice when all the rats were added to cities that those rats are KOS to wolf form, so I knew as those rats were added during the pop push that wolf form would be kos in pop ;)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I think it's fine that wolf form is KOS in pop and I think the benifits of wolf form (extra speed, mana regen, attack,vision) are the price you pay for being kos.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Now I would like it if one could be NON-KOS in wolf form IF you have the best factions to the pop NPCs. &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Just like Velious factions...when I worked for many months to become ally to COV...low and behold..I could then be a wolf in western wastes and be dubious to the dragons.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;My reward for all the faction work was being able to use wolf form.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Just removing factions from wolf form will make trivial all the time some druids have spent to enjoy the benifits.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;A solution may be to &amp;nbsp;add many factions to pop/god so your reward for ally factions is being able to be a NON-kos wolf. That was a nice reward in Velious, Kunark and the old world....give that reward to the 65+ wolfs too so they can experience it ;)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;To much gameplay has been made trivial allready, to easy for the 65+ crowd. The changes like charm exp. nurfs, more bard fizzles trickle down and effect low level gameplay to much allready!&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;You all forget how is was pre-65 druids and I suspect by some of the comments above that many druids never played all the levels themself ;)&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>Nope,&amp;nbsp; Make Wolfform non-kos to anything that wouldn't normally attack wolves.&amp;nbsp; That was the whole reason for getting wolfform.&amp;nbsp; Why would you turn into a tree or wolf if the illusion does not work?&amp;nbsp; If you make wolfform KOS then EVERY illusion should be KOS.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Anyone that argues that wolfform is overpowering and should be less than what it was designed for is just nerfing druids ability to blend into nature.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Sure, some things should agro to wolves..&amp;nbsp; Kerran, undead, lizzards for a few, anything that does not have a wolf as a natural part of their nature would see it as not belonging.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; But any zone that has wolves and trees should not agro to a wolf or tree unless they normally kill all of the ones in the zone already.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It is already limited to outdoors so how is it overpowering?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I agree that unrest was not a place you would see wolves but Mistmore and Great Divide are.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Why should I have to do months of factioning just to be dubious in WW when there are wolves there that don't agro anything.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Why would a druid cast an illusion so bad that it really doesn't look like a wolf?&amp;nbsp; Is he really that stupid??&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Soo... I repeat if Wolfform is so overpowering then all illusions are and should make anyone that uses an illusion KOS.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We only get two illusions that already have tremedous limitations on them, why do you want to nerf them more? &#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;I have Chardoc facton and could pull the King which is the same example you use as the dwarf where you state it is overpowering.&amp;nbsp; Does that mean that if I get Chardoc faction then I should become KOS in Chardoc??&amp;nbsp; Which is more powerful?&amp;nbsp; LV 20 group content or being able to pull items for Epics that used to take raids??&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If pulling the dwarf makes it overpowering then leveling also makes you over powering since I can go into the basement at lv 65 and pull the dwarf out solo... So we should make lv 65 KOS also I guess...&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Your arguement to keep wolfform nerfed are not very convincing to me.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;SoTW reuse timer change to 15 min&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;Honestly, I am not interested in this. 22 minutes vs 15 minutes, not a huge deal for what SoTW was intended for. Now, if you are a druid thinking this is your group heal spell, then yeah, 22 minutes is a long time to wait. The suggestion I have here is to create a new and different group heal that has a faster refresh.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Some kind of reincarnate/revive/summon person ability that summons a person to their corpse&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;I completely disagree with this. It is not appropriate from the role-playing aspects of a druid. What I would like to see, however, is a complimentary ability to the cleric's rez. I am thinking of a "Nature's Rejuvination" where rez effects are removed and mana and health regen to restore a recently rezzed toon to a healthy state. This could be a mgb'able group ability.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Improve bear pet (stronger, better, more useful like wiz familiar, maybe resist AE, add dual wield)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT color=#6633ff&gt;I think that "improve" is the wrong word. "Redefine" would be more appropriate. I would focus on having the bear be more like the familiar rather than making it more pet like. Do away with the "tease" of booboo the pet and replace him with a line of nature's warders (wizzy familiars of the pure and unsullied tunare kind),&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;HR&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;SotW timer should be in line with other classes abilities time limit. Ether way this skill is more restricted by the reuse time of MGB vs the timer on it.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;With the rez you need to think about the number of times your group healing without a&amp;nbsp;class that can do this duty. Much to the same with instanced zones/time limits its far greater that groups will pass on 2 druids healing vs 1 cleric simply because if someone dies no one can do anything about it. I have had to restart a number of GoD instanced content because the enchanter died or the cleric died and we had to evac out and wait for them to come back. Even a non exp rez with the option of allowing a cleric rez later, ie not removing the rez counter, would help greatly here.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;I totally agree with the bear pet. This was only given to us as a token "fun" toy not any real serious attempt at giving us a pet to use.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;P&gt;One thing I would like to add which would most definetely bring some of the healing issues into balance.&amp;nbsp; Take the Focus effect restrictions off of our % heals.&amp;nbsp; Leave them unable to crit, but make them affected by imp. healing, spell haste, and mana preservation.&amp;nbsp; This is not unbalancing due to the fact that even with the best gear with the highest of these focus effects a druid (specialized in alteration) will still have less mana efficiency than a level 39 cleric who forgot to train in specialization.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Just a thought.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Also I would like to see our quick heals casting times reduced slightly, and possibly the mana cost of them tuned a bit more.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;P&gt;Unfortunately we can not make additions to the list at this time.&amp;nbsp; I am happy to make wording changes to make sure the items on the list are experessed properly to Development though.&amp;nbsp; I do need you to indicate for me which items on this list are alterations to current abilities and spells already in the game and which are "wish list" items.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;Keep any additional issues you would like to add in mind for the next time we discuss issues like this.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;

      <description>For the most part, my post was in reference to #1 on the list, addressing the healing abilities of the druid class.&amp;nbsp; I would just like to offer my post as a suggestion of how druids healing power could be brought up without&amp;nbsp;adding new spells, abilities or throwing balance completely out of whack.&#xD;

      <description>Please increase the level limit on our level 63 animal charm (Command of Tunare?) to match enchanters.&amp;nbsp; If you're going to give us a charm at least let us use it.&amp;nbsp; After retuning GoD we can no long charm in Vxed/Tipt.&#xD;
