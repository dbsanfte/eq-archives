      <title>Wreckers on Bertox, Australian timezone raiding guild</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Guilds&amp;message.id=895#M895</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Wreckers raid 3 nights per week and are currently farming Anguish and Vish while working on Demiplane.&amp;nbsp; We also dabble in PoR and TSS for a bit of variety.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;For those&amp;nbsp;who it matters to, we&amp;nbsp;use a so called "merit" based loot system, where loot won is roughly proportional to raid attendance.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, if loot is the main reason you're&amp;nbsp;playing EQ, you probably won't enjoy Wreckers that much.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We're looking for a warrior and shaman to round out our raid force.&amp;nbsp; We are highly biased towards people living in or near our timezone, rather than US/Europe based players that think they can manage to get up at 2am (or whatever) for 3 nights per week to make raids.&amp;nbsp; We like to see people play on off nights too so that they are part of&amp;nbsp;the guild and&amp;nbsp;not just a warm body on raids.&amp;nbsp; Having said that, we do have&amp;nbsp;a few treasured&amp;nbsp;members from the US, Europe and other areas, so it's not impossible to get in if you're a night-shifter or whatever.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;We have no attendance requirements per se (yes you CAN have a real life too!), but since raid instances are close to full we're only looking to recruit players who can make the majority of raids.&amp;nbsp; That may seem contradictory, but it is far easier to&amp;nbsp;manage raid size and setup&amp;nbsp;with 2 players&amp;nbsp;on 80% attendance than&amp;nbsp;8 players with 20% (as an example).&amp;nbsp; And given our casual raiding schedule, "high" attendance isn't overly hard to achieve.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Head to &lt;A href="http://www.wreckers.org" target=_blank&gt;www.wreckers.org&lt;/A&gt; for more information, or send tells to bertox.aamasie, bertox.thoraf or hell even me bertox.weolyen.&amp;nbsp; Some other classes also have openings for the right people.&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>New guild on Povar, Deathclaw</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Guilds&amp;message.id=893#M893</link>
      <description>Deathclaw is a new guild on the povar server. We are currently&#xD;
recruiting players level 35 - 52. Our current level cap is 52 so we can&#xD;
do naggy and vox for epics. The level cap will be raised periodically&#xD;
when it suits the needs of the guild. The biggest reason for the level&#xD;
cap is so the guild stays together as a solid raiding force. With the&#xD;
new AA system, tanks and whoever wants to will be able to work their&#xD;
necessary AAs without having to worry about the guild leveling past&#xD;
them. We do not have a set raiding schedule, we just pickup and kill&#xD;
whatever we need when we have enough people on. We plan on working&#xD;
through norrath from beginning to end, progressing as we grow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If&#xD;
you're interested, please visit us at&#xD;
http://www.guildportal.com/Guild.aspx?GuildID=117094&amp;amp;TabID=999256&#xD;
or go to Guildportal.com and search for Deathclaw and put in a basic&#xD;
app with your in game name, class, level and current goals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We&#xD;
do require all members to register on the website in order to help us&#xD;
keep track of who needs what. We also will have our current goals and&#xD;
level cap on there. Feel free to send a tell to Galadan, Dranalia or&#xD;
Senge if you have any questions.&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>The best EQ experience, guild No Retreat is recruiting; bringing back the old/good EQ for us VETS!</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Guilds&amp;message.id=886#M886</link>
      <description>Hello. I want to make this short as I know many people do not like reading alot when it comes to "just another guild-recruit message".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I started guild No Retreat on The Sleeper, and was quickly #1 until the power-levelers took over and dominated everything; I quickly got fed-up and moved the guild back home, to Lanys/7th, where my mains where.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Long-Story-Short:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am Yotix, Drakkin Warrior, and I welcome any-&amp;-all to join; regardless of level/AA, class/race, experience &amp; time-zone situation(s).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We DO have a webpage and you are more than welcome to check it out: http://www.no-retreat.net&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We DO have Voice-Chat AND a Forum&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We ARE leader of up-and-coming server-wide guild-alliance, eliminated the tedious LFG-troubles, let alone over-priced gear, quests/raids you cannot do alone or at least in small-numbers, and exclusive lotteries AND events that you will not want to miss (on The Sleeper, I gave 1,000pp to each group-member in top-five groups for scavenger-hunt, as a quick example).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I made this guild to not only bring back the OLD EverQuest experience(s) long-time players like myself enjoy, such as raiding long-dead zones, 10th Ring Wars, actually doing/completing Epic-Quests, and of course, in-game "uber-ness" progression. Also, Role-Play &amp; Lore-Play is highly-encouraged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I did not make this guild so I could be the next leader of the next big uber-guild or any childish activity like that; I made this guild because I know people like myself are outnumbered -- We want to PLAY and EXPERIENCE EQ, not just max-level and AA, then go get uberness loot and PVP in Bazaar and/or FP Arena, bragging and showing-off our flaming-swords.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As stated above, I am a long-time player from basically all-servers, but mainly Fennin &amp; Druzzil (and obviously Lanys/7th), and I was an officer in such guilds as TMO, La'Malla, and for my nearly eight-month (8) stay on StormHammer back when Legends was $39.99/month, in TSR during the "Let's Spam-Kill Quarm" days. I remember getting our Velious-Helms, let alone sets of Kael AC-armour, and I have played EverQuest 1 since Beta-2, when teh Devs. had Mith.Marr Vs. Inny' on the Kithicor Bridge (for an example if anyone remembers those days). I also remember fishing in Ocean of Tears (REMEMBER THAT ZONE!) for Fine Steel gear, and all the NEC pathing-bugs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just giving a quick-history, because I don't want people thinking the opposite of why I made this guild in the 1st-place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More info. is available @ no-retreat.net and you all are more than welcome to check out the website, let alone contact me in-game (/tell Yotix).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I apologize if you consider this a long-post, and I don't mean to spam, but I figured this was the easiest-way to not only recruit members but give others the chance to experience the EverQuest I am trying to resurrect from long-death...if they would like that opportunity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In conclusion, as stated above, I am welcoming everyone, all levels/languages/classes/races/time-zones, as I want everyone and anyone to be able to join if they want...not just so I am your guild-leader, but so we can play EverQuest the way it was MEANT to be, breaking away from the "PL me to L75 in 4 days then let's merc Vex Thal &amp; Time". Yes, we'll do that too, but there is so much more to this land of Norrath than getting a glowing-weapon, or a smoking-shield, and beating an Un-God in the head...then not playing for a month because you're bored of raiding the same zone over. And over...and over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope everyone takes this seriously and doesn't disregard this as another tool trying to make a super-spiffy guild to get uberness and entrance to the EQ Hall of Fame.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you &amp; may God bless. You are more than welcome to contact me, but your best chance is in-game. If you'd like an invite, I will come to you, as I think it's only common-courtesy to do so (unless you're faster than I am, lol).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you once again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~ Yotix, Drakkin Warrior / Aruin, Dark-Elven Shadow Knight</description>

Ventrillo is required for listening to raids - no mic required.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;IMG alt="" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v67/sertretsin/newbanner3.jpg" border=0&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00 size=3&gt;NOBLE RAGE IS NOW RECRUITING!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;NOBLE RAGE is an active family raiding guild on Prexus. We believe that just because you take raiding seriously that doesn't mean your guild's personality has to suffer. It is possible to have the best of both worlds! We have both a casual, family style atmosphere with lots of guild activities, XP groups, and support to help you along the way!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We offer:&lt;BR&gt;* a jovial, family style environment&lt;BR&gt;* an average of 3 scheduled raids / events per week&lt;BR&gt;* guild XP groups on nights that have no other events&lt;BR&gt;* support for our members to help them grow&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Our current raid targets include&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt; &lt;B&gt;MPG Trials&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;, &lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;Epic 1.5 and 2.0&lt;/FONT&gt; targets for our members, &lt;FONT color=red&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;Theater of Blood&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;,&lt;/FONT&gt; Plane of Time for applicants, and various other targets from Omens of War, Depths of Darkhollow, Prophecy of Ro, The Serpent's Spine and newer content. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Attendance on our raids is never mandatory or required, but our loot is awarded using a Raid Points / auction system that favors those who have attended more events. Our typical "busy hours" during which most events take place are 6 PM to 9 PM Pacific on weekdays (9 PM to Midnight Eastern) or 11 AM to 11 PM Pacific on weekends (1 PM to 2 AM Eastern), but there are always lots of folks on, even during off hours.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Our atmosphere is fun -- we like to clown around -- but we do take our game play seriously and we expect each member to know how to play his or her class, and to work constantly at improving their play and their character. Our members come from all walks of life and most of us have real life time commitments (kids, jobs, spouses, etc.) that limit their playing hours. We definitely understand that real life comes first.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;NOBLE RAGE recruitment is currently open. We believe the healthiest guild environment is one with a proper mix of classes for both raiding and grouping. For this reason, we limit recruitment on those classes that we already have a sufficient guild population of. Our current needs (by class) are as follows:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bard: - Moderate Need&lt;BR&gt;Beastlord: - Moderate Need&lt;BR&gt;Berserker: - Moderate Need&lt;BR&gt;Cleric: - &lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;HIGH NEED&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;Druid: - &lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;HIGH NEED&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;Enchanter: - Moderate Need&lt;BR&gt;Mage: - &lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Recruitment Closed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Monk: - &lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Recruitment Closed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Necromancer: - &lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Recruitment Closed&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;Paladin: - &lt;FONT color=#ffffff&gt;Recruitment Closed&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ranger: - Moderate Need&lt;BR&gt;Rogue: - &lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;HIGH NEED&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Shadowknight: - &lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;HIGH NEED&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;Shaman: - Moderate Need&lt;BR&gt;Warrior: - Moderate Need&lt;BR&gt;Wizard: - Moderate Need&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Note that exceptions to this list may be made for exceptional applicants. If recruitment is closed on your class but you think that you may qualify as an exceptional applicant, send a tell or in game e-mail to an officer. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You must be a minimum level of 70 to apply to Noble Rage. We do not require any minimum number of AAs or flags, although if you have them that's a bonus! WE CARE MORE ABOUT YOUR PERSONALITY THEN YOUR MAGELO! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For more information about us, visit our webpage, &lt;A href="http://www.noblerage.org./" target=_blank&gt;&lt;FONT color=#fede01&gt;&lt;FONT color=#ffff00&gt;www.noblerage.org&lt;/FONT&gt;.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;IMG alt="" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v67/sertretsin/uncleret1.jpg" border=0&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <description>Unlike most upper level guilds, we don't restrict membership to anyone as long as you are level 10 and are a decent human being.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; With that said, the majority of our players are in the 65+ level range and we are currently working on various raids and group missions (DoN, DoD, PoR, and TSS once released).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are always on the lookout for members within this upper level range who enjoy doing these missions and raiding new content or keyed areas.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If this appeals to you, please contact either Idiotan, Narah, Arielnicole, Zanman, or Kazpin on the Bristlebane Server.&amp;nbsp; One of them will be able to assist you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are also always on the lookout for Assistant Raid Leaders.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If you have raid leading skills that aren't being utilized in your current situation, we would like to speak to you.&amp;nbsp; We believe in learning by doing and give everyone a chance to prove themselves.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earthen Guardians&lt;br&gt;Bristlebane Server&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

So if you think you would like to check it out, we have a website being built via guild portal (just serch for Tome) ,&amp;nbsp; where we have a section under forums that you may drop a bit about yourself or send a tell to me TinyOak ( guild leader ) or one of my officers..Thrimm, Angos, Taino, Denna or Lailya (euro recruitment).&lt;/DIV&gt;</description>

      <title>Valoran - Demi-Plane guild on the Maelin Starpyre Server</title>
      <link>http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Guilds&amp;message.id=861#M861</link>
      <description>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.valoran.net/" target=_blank&gt;Valoran&lt;/A&gt;, a Demi-Plane guild on the Maelin Starpyre Server is looking for more high attendance, high skill, team-oriented attitude players.&amp;nbsp; Valoran was created on 10/16/99 as a raiding guild on the Karana server. It has undergone its ups and downs and various splits, before moving to the &lt;U&gt;Maelin Starpyre&lt;/U&gt; server upon its opening. Valoran took a break from the game in the summer '04, to return early '05. We started off where we left off and have progressed nicely, leapfrogging several guilds on the server in progression.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Valoran fully intends to continue its progression in Demi-Plane, PoR, and in TSS upon its release.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Our current farm list includes Anguish, DoN(Mostly Vish) and various targets in PoR. Our raid schedule tends to be every night except Fridays, with some exceptions. Our main focus at this present time is to progress, while still leaving time to farm mobs.&amp;nbsp; We're a guild that aims to both have fun and get the job done while working together as a team.&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Our usual start time is 7pm EST.&amp;nbsp; Every now and then raids may begin as early as 6pm EST or as late as 8pm EST, but these are not common.&amp;nbsp; (Weekend raids are more common to start a bit earlier)&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;Class needs:&amp;nbsp; We're currently reviewing applications from all classes.&amp;nbsp; We'll factor in class need, play time, gear, AA, flags (Demi-flagged is a plus)&amp;nbsp;before deciding to accept an applicant for trial.&amp;nbsp; Valoran is not looking for members who log at 10pm EST constantly, we're looking for raiders 7pm EST - 11pm EST 4 days a week mininum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;
&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&#xD;

&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bydr and Crystilla are our two recruiting officers and can give you information and information about our server transfer specialists (others who have transferred to us and are willing to share their story, good and bad).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;;t erollisi.bydr&lt;BR&gt;;t erollisi.crystilla&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Must have's:&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Level 70 (will increase after the new expansion)&lt;BR&gt;- AA's adjust based on need but currently are 200 for wizard/berserker and 300 for enchanter/rogue/ranger&lt;BR&gt;- Raiding experience/gear at the Qvic+ level&lt;BR&gt;- Decent playtime (15+ hours a week during our raid hours); please note, we do NOT raid Fridays or Saturdays&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We are looking for members who are NOT loot or content driven (friendship, personality and fun are more important); we want folks are looking for a relaxed environment (with all its pros and cons).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Must NOT have's:&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- No 3rd party, illegal programs&lt;BR&gt;- No raid boxing (we develop a single character during raids and exp time, not alts).&lt;BR&gt;- Language issues (we "try" to be a PG13 guild, so if your vocabulary only consists of 4-letter words we may not be the guild for you).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;FLAG/KEY REQUIREMENTS:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody1&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Currently over half our raid regular raid week is spent in keyed zones, and given our short app period, we now have the following requirements: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody1&gt;Before placing an application, potential applicants are required to have the following: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody1&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;Anguish signets&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;- at least 4 of the 7 completed (all is preferred) &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody1&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;Dreadspire access&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;- at least 2-3 of the 4 (preferably all 4 group missions completed) &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody1&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0066ff&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Temple of Blood &lt;/SPAN&gt;access&lt;/FONT&gt; - at least 3 of the 7 missions completed &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody1&gt;All anguish signets must be finished/turned in before the end of the 1st full week as an applicant. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN class=postbody1&gt;If a potential applicant does not meet these requirements but feels they are an exceptional candidate, they can contact Crystilla/Bydr to determine which requirements can be waived. Possible options include tagging to Chaotic, but no raiding until requirements are met, extension of app period until requirements are met and other options.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;LOOT SYSTEM:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Given our half part time (1-2 day a week) and half full time (3-5 days a week) raiders, we use a combination Loot Council, Dictatorship and Point System with a rotating 45 day point rot system that rewards current raiders (we do not use lifetime points).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Why does PE have this hybrid loot system? Because we want a semi evenly-geared guild.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;PE wants all members robustly geared, ready to take turns doing whatever their class needs to do. It’s like an &lt;U&gt;orchestra&lt;/U&gt; whose musicians all have fine skills and instruments and are ready to play anything they need to.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In contrast, some guilds' goal is more like a &lt;U&gt;movie cast&lt;/U&gt;: a few superstars in key roles, some lesser stars as supporting cast, and lots of extras in minor roles. Their loot systems favor making sure that the superstars always have the most uber gear, followed by the supporting cast, with the extras only getting scraps.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
