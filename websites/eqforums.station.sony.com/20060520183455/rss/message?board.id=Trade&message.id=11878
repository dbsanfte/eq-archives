      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Here are two quotes from Allakazaam&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;You can get 12 words needed for high level Necromancer pet research from the three Sisters (X`Ta Tempi, Timpi, and Tompi) in Neriak Foreign Quarters (-10, -45). I&lt;b&gt;t is really easier to get them though randomly looting creatures than by doing the quests&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"&lt;b&gt;I tried doing this quest to get Words of Haunting, the ..... Took all the items and gave Nothing back&lt;/b&gt;"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I stand by my assertion.  You may be able to quest the words for this research only spell, but one might ask why if it is either broke or more difficult than trying to get the droped words.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As to the Ethereal words.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, what can I say, I was in PoHate for 3 weeks, trying to get a Staff of Elemental Mastery:Earth for my 2nd Magician.  I am going to just guess that was around 80 hours of camping up there.  Hum, I got a grand total of 1 Words of the Ethereal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To say that the Words of the Ethereal drop all over the place is effectivly to say nothing at all.  I do not believe anyone has stated they do not drop.  No I dont think any one has.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What has been said is the chance of getting them, with out the direct support of a Large Player Base is pretty darn slim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now on my server, which highlights this problem is the most naked, raw facts, I have a Buyer in the Bazaar that lets everyone know what words are being bought.  I might get 1 ethereal a week, I might get 1 Haunting evern month.  I get 1 Agony every year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You say well people are just doing the combines them selves, No not at all, I am being asked by most Necromancers to do the combines.  Nope they dont get those words either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Raw, naked truth is that Spell Drops, Word Drops, the heart blood of Spell Casters, is singularly tied to the good graces, the well informed, kindness of a Large Player Base that is willing to work, stop what it is doing, to get you what you need &lt;b&gt;OR farm them and sell them to you at a price that requires you to buy plat from Yantis&lt;/b&gt; OR become one of those most dispicable Plat Farmers, farming HG's, IG's etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;OR&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Go like a bat out of hades to what ever the current skill cap is and then go back and farm what ever you need.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by EnigmaMaitreya on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;04-03-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;05:58 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Or you could use the Words of Crippling Force in the bazaar, there are 38 for sale right now from 30 to 200 pp.  Also a single piece combine that can take a necro to 182 in research.  I'm just not seeing a problem on Povar as far as lack of people selling these research items.  Are they expensive?  Definitely.  But so is every other tradeskill component out there now it seems.  So, I hardly see research as a larger problem than the other tradeskills as far as skill-ups are concerned.  Perhaps your server is different, though, I don't know.  What server are you on?   Seems weird to me that you have necromancers asking you to do these combines if there is no player base in this range that would hunt at this level range and thus actually need the spell (and yet still not finding any of these drop).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure I really understand your 'raw, naked truth' paragraph.  Of course people need help to get certain things.  That's not exclusive to spells or casters even.  You can even do it without buying platinum.  Actually, if your theory were true, then no one would be able to get anything that didn't require you to buy platinum and yet people seem to get all kinds of nontradeable spells and gear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If most of the research components always dropped from certain spots would that be an acceptable solution?  Like say Words of the Ethereal only dropped from Frogloks in Old Sebilis?  That would certainly put it more in line with some of the other tradeskills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Only slightly off-topic, but after DoN came out I noticed a trend.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I hardly ever find blue diamonds on vendors anymore, a trend that started soon after the guild halls were created.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Many people bind themselves in the guild lobby, and then go to the guildhall to bank and sell there loot to the vendor inside the hall.  This vendor can only be accessed by guildmates and not the general public.  Therefore, 1000s of items every week which used to find their way onto a vendor in PoK or other public places now end up in the guildhall, where they will eventually POOF away when the instance goes down and resets their vendor.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The same thing can probably be said for researching items.  The amont that used to find it's way to public vendors has been reduced down by the number that get sold to a guildhall vendor.  Which further reduces the chance of finding what you need.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by Zacatac_BB on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;04-03-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;08:59 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Since words are a random drop from any mob in any zone it's pretty much blind chance whether you can get them to drop. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;FrothyPintwrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;If most of the research components always dropped from certain spots would that be an acceptable solution?

As you say, if a traditional tradeskiller wants to skill up tailoring they can go and hunt bears for bearskins and spiders for silks and so on in a focused attempt to get the required components. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zacatac_BB also makes an excellent point regarding the guild lobby vendor sucking a significant number of tradeskill items out the game. This is obviously a point that affects all tradeskills and not just research but is a very important observation.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I would just like to say to the Dev's please either change this skill back or add to vendore thru out the game the items needed to work on this skill in a reasonable amount of time. The drop rate on asome words ( and runes ) is laughable.......the posts above are right a lot of the &amp;quot;trash &amp;quot; that was once dumped on POK ( and other ) vendors now gets dumped in the GH.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I just thought that since I solo in a lot of zones and see tons of spell components (my enchanter is at 243 now raw skill), I would take the time to share what I have found.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;#1 I get tons of Words of the Ethereal from Sebilis. The fact that you may not see as many as you once might have is that they are also used for Erudite cultural tailoring. Many enchanter pages also drop in Sebilis.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;#2 Many different words drop from the Gor Taku and Shak Dratha in the caves in Shadeweaver's Thicket.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;#3 Rune of Zephyr drops about twice during a hard Guk LDoN as well as usually two Rune of Tempest in the same time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;#4 Some of the Yaeth's half pages, Staff Shards and Words of Control drop from the bandits in Fungus Grove. The mushrooms in Fungus Grove also drop spell components with great frequency.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;#5 Lots of words and pages drop from the Grimlings in the tunnels leading to Acrylia Caverns.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I hope these tips help some of you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Just for Fun as I may have misread the statement about there are no research only spells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BUT&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Necromancer line&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Level 34(old) Invoke Shadow, the level 34 Necromancer pet.  To say this is optional would be to tell a melee to put thier weapons away from level 34 to 39.  Or prehpas more appropriatly to use Rusty Weapons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Level 49(old) Invoke Death, the necromancer pet.  Same as above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Level 49(old) Lich, the Necromancer class defining spell line that transfers health to mana.  Class defining as in the means by wich a Necromancer can effectiovly Solo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any of the above spells, for you to say they are optional, well, when you say the Melee crowd needs to use rusty weapons for a given Level range, then you might get my attention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I could also add the old level 24 Necromancer pet as research only but I dun forgot its name&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Boy, why didn't I think of that as an easier fix!?!?!?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Make the research skill available to all classes and THEN make a percentage of research only spells 'no drop', especially those critical, in-demand class defining ones.  There are a number of items made with other tradeskills that are no-drop, so there is precedent for it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This would force more people to research, which in turn would cause a larger percentage of the player population to demand more research drops and clarification on what drops where from SOE.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;I would agree that research is no where close to having a realistic way to skill it up.  But of course once you get to about 200 in any tradeskill none have any realisitic way for you to skill it up without a TON of farming and a TON of plat spent in the process.  I liked how EQ2 had its tradeskills set up.  I dont quite mean the system itself but when you did them in EQ2 it didnt feel tedious and boredomsome like EQ1s are.  While you were lfg in eq2 you could have some fun doing tradeskills while lfg.  Would be nice if you could do that with tradeskills in EQ1.  Tradeskills in EQ1 are one of those things where you spend a ton of time on them but the amount of time spent is not worth the reward in the end even though maxed tradeskills are nice, the amount of effort and plat put into them is a complete waste of time and effort compared to all those AA's, armor and augs you could have obtained through grouping and raiding.  I dont see tradeskills as being realistic at all anymore.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;My main concern in this debate is the equating of research to other tradeskills and the comparative ease, or otherwise, of obtaining the necessary components for skilling up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I feel this is unfair and detracts from the main issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tradeskills are something that some players enjoy and partake in for a variety of reasons. However, tradeskills are essentially a side issue to character development and are entirely optional. No one is forced to take up baking in order to gain skills that will enhance their performance in a group or solo setting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, research *is* a required skill if you wish for your character to have access to some quite desirable spells that will aid in your progression. Either you will need to skill up yourself or you will become dependent upon others to do it for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tradeskills are optional, research isn't.&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;I have to completely disagree with you here.&amp;nbsp; Research is completely optional.&amp;nbsp; Can you name any spells created via research that are No Drop?&amp;nbsp; I can't think of a single one.&amp;nbsp; Now there are quests that require you use Research for a combine, but there are many many&amp;nbsp; quests that use other Tradeskills for combines so that is a non-issue.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;So sorry research is in NO way a required skill.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The point I was making, and it's even included in the part you quoted, is that I either have to skill up research myself or I am dependent upon others doing it for me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The spells created are certainly tradeable but the fact remains that the spells will only exist if someone skills up in research to make them; ie they are *research only* spells. So, I have to do the work myself or pay the prices set by others that have already done it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If "research only" spells are to exist in the game then research is a required skill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By contrast, there are many desirable items made by the traditional tradeskills but none of them are essential as there are mob-drops and quest items of a comparable nature as an alternative.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is for the above reasons that I feel it is unfair compairing the time and effort involved in traditional tradeskills to the time and effort required for research. The former is an optional game component whilst the latter is not.&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

This means hunting in the zones where these spell components drop. Seeing leveling up is quicker than it used to be, i see a valid point regarding availability of components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, i don;t see validity in the blanket statements regarding spell research. If individual pages for specific spells for OLD research have gotten too hard, it is best to signal these individual cases to the developers/post these cases and hope that for these individual components the droprate can be increased. However, trading for pages and vendor mining has always been a valid way for researchers to get their skill up /spells made&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system might not be perfect, but it sure isn;t as bad as you make it out to be. The work up is quite easy if you prepare to use both the regualr components and the practice runes while leveling up. It might affect your choice of zones, but that is something that melees have had to deal with always seeing the desirable weapons will only drop in certain zones too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by qualan on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;04-03-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;11:41 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by qualan on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;04-03-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;11:51 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;P&gt;Let me make my point, those spells that are desireable are also optional.&amp;nbsp; There is nothing ingame that is required to play and level.&amp;nbsp; There are several desireable items I'd like but I don't have the skill to make them, that doesn't make the skill that makes them required.&amp;nbsp; You're looking at it as if the desireable spells are any different for&amp;nbsp;casters as the desireable weapon or armor made via TSs can be to melee.&amp;nbsp; And as with all the other tradeskills 9 times out of 10 if you bother to gather the components yourself, most people who do have the skill to make the combines will do them for cheap or even free.&lt;/P&gt;&#xD;
&lt;P&gt;BTW I'm willing to bet that the TS with the most components sold to vendors would undoubtably be Research!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;quot;I am still boggling over the concept that all skills should be doable to 180 within 4 hours.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Correction, i&lt;b&gt;s doable to 188 in 4 hours&lt;/b&gt;, *Raises Eyebrow* &lt;b&gt;Except Research wich cant be done at all, uless there is a massive player base participating in the collection and redistribution of the research components.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which of course is the point of this thread.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That the paradigm that defines the research mechanism is obsolete and either needs to be done away with totaly or needs to be revamped in such a way that it serves some useful purpose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It should be noted that in the very begining a statisticly insignificant number of the EQ player base ever wanted research anyway.  Even fewer people want it now.  So just changing the research only spells to either/and/or MoB drops or Quested removes this .... anomaly called Research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by EnigmaMaitreya on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;03-31-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;09:44 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
