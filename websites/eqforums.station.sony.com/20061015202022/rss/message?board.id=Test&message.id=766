    <description>Alright fables own, but why are they still here? One of my main concern is the ideal fact that people can't easily finish their epic 1.0.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

There has only been one change sofar and that is free expansions for all of test. That also has not doubled the population or is 16% increase doubling the population?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dont forget some of the development staff already working on the next expansion....&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I can't speak for the devs of course, but it seems more than a 16% increase to me as well.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The population has not doubled, its only increased by 16%, as quoted by Rhagnell in this thread &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Test&amp;message.id=626&amp;view=by_date_ascending&amp;page=2"&gt;http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Test&amp;amp;message.id=626&amp;amp;view=by_date_ascending&amp;amp;page=2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[quote] Since the day we put up the news item and opened up all of the expansions the Test population has definitely been up.  Right now we are beating our old average by just a smidge over 16%.[/quote]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Cid,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Fableds were turned on as a special action prior to the Anniversary Event.  It is possible that this is what is precluding thier being turned off with the Anniversary Event being turned off.  Despite the rumors being spread and the names being droped.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We know that being part of test does not give us priorities.  It is very probable that the ones that can in fact resolve this are ... rather busy with another project with a short dead line.  It is very possible we will be require to simply deal with this as we have been required to deal with ... simular situations in the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would I rather they take time and resolve some things on Test Server vs Getting the new Server up and running?  *Gimaces* Not really, I would rather see them paying attention to Live issues over the needs of Test.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message Edited by EnigmaMaitreya on &lt;span class="date_text"&gt;05-07-2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="time_text"&gt;01:04 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enigma,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't think anyone is expecting the dev's to drop what they are doing to remove the fableds. What is more frustrating is the lack/limited of communication between the dev's, QA and the test players. Within a week after the Anniversary event was removed from the production inquires about when fableds would be removed from test began. The response given by various dev's and QA members when asked, both in game, and in chat was that they didn't know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they don't know that's fine, but someone has to know and at this point (a month later) is it really unfair of us to expect an official response one way or the other? I've no issues with all the testing, changes and what-have-you that needs to be done to get the progression server up and ready for its June launch. It's just disappointing after the effort that was put forth during the server wide PoK meeting about opening lines of communication that now months later they're still lacking*.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Stavos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clan Mistwolf&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Yes I know it has gotten better, but there's still room to improve, and yes I know some folks will think it was naive of me to assume that changes would occur from the PoK meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It is pretty frustrating yes.  Several of my guild and otehr ppl on the server are at key steps in Epic 1.0 quests that are blocked by Fabled mobs that are rather difficult to just grab a pickup group for and kill.  We have had Fabled on Test since latre February for testing.  Its been nearly 3 months, really wish they would be removed or if they are a new permanent &amp;quot;feature&amp;quot; of Test Server, at least reduce them to a 50/50 chance to spawn fabled or the original version.  Not fabled 100% of the time on the higher end mobs.</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Please either take the Fableds off the server, set to a once a month basis, or eliminate the Epic Mobs as Fableds.  The mob in City of Mist &amp;quot;Lord  Rak' Ashiir&amp;quot; is a turn in mob for the Shaman Epic 1.0.  You turn in the childs tear then the mob agros.  Well, the Fabled version immediately aggros and you cannot do the turn in or complete the Epic.  This is just one example.  I'm sure there are many other examples.  And skipping directly to 1.5 is out of the question, we spent too much time and effort already.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;However you do decide to keep the Fableds, please give us the consideration and let us know.  Everytime we patch, it's &amp;quot;Are the Fableds still up?&amp;quot;   Also, there's a big boulder at the zone line to Lavaspinners near the DoN camps.  It is the same type of boulder that was set up on the day of the DoN expansion release.  Can ya move it? &lt;/div&gt;</description>
