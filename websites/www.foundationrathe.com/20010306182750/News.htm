        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This weekend Foundation Rathe went romping
        through the Plane of Sky.&nbsp; Along the way we picked up 7 completed
        quests and a few FA items.&nbsp; <a href="pics/pics_from_Sid_2/slickaep2.jpg">Slicka
        Dragoneye's FA</a> was completed and 4 other warriors received swing
        blades during the mass chicken murder on isle 5.&nbsp; On isle 6, we had
        big bixie momma, who obliged by dying for us and giving us a nice spread
        photo.&nbsp; We moved on to isle 7 for some much needed items for out
        mages.&nbsp; All in all, it was an excellent trip.&nbsp; Grats to
        everyone that received items and especially to Slicka for completing his
        FA!&nbsp; <a href="Pictures.htm">See the pics</a>...

        I'm kind of busy the next week or so, but I'll add a main link to it
        sometime... in the meantime, the above link will be the only link to
        it.. on this page, at least :)

        <a href="http://www.guildsay.com/guilds/view_character.php?id=390">Insidius</a>
        sent some pretty cool pictures to me of Western Wastes and Sirens
        Ghrotto, so I added them to the <a href="Pictures.htm">pictures page</a>
        along with my usual-trying-to-be-funny-but-end-up-being-stupid comments

        has been checking out the Ghrotto the past couple of days, still waiting
        on his lazy Necro behind to send me some pics to post =)&nbsp; In the
        meantime, our resident photographer, <a href="http://www.guildsay.com/guilds/view_character.php?id=566">Fezeden</a>,

        through.&nbsp; They are posted under the pics section.&nbsp;
