<p><b><font face="Century Gothic" size="4" color="#FF0000">Applying for membership</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The first step in applying for membership is to post an
&quot;application&quot; on the <a href="http://pub72.ezboard.com/bfoundationrathe99584" target="_blank">Recruiting
Forum</a>. Please include the following information:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Character Name:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Class:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Level:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Any Alternate characters you might want guilded:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Typical Play time (both weekday and weekend):</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Time Zone:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Everquest Experience (i.e. how long you have been
playing, etc.):</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Past Guild Experience (please include any guilds
you are currently a member of):</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">How did you hear about Foundation Rathe:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">What members have you adventured with:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">After you have submitted an application, you must
contact me (Mithandriel) in game so I can go over some fine points about our
guild (some of which will be explained below).&nbsp; As some point we will have
an informal &quot;interview&quot; so that I can get to know you better.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF0000">Sponsored Applicants</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We prefer that applicants be somewhat familiar
with our guild and know at least one member who would act as your sponsor.&nbsp;
A sponsor is someone that you know fairly well and can attest to your ability as
a player and your character as a person.&nbsp; If you are interested in joining
Foundation Rathe and you think someone will sponsor you, please contact that
person and ask them if they would be willing to do that. Assuming the person is
willing to sponsor you, please be sure to include that in your application.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As a side note, I take the word and opinions of
my members very seriously so having a sponsor makes admission into FR much
easier.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF0000"><b>Non-Sponsored Applicants</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We certainly welcome all members of the Everquest
gaming community to apply to Foundation Rathe even if they do not know any
members personally or have only had limited exposure to us or our members.&nbsp;
Please follow the link above to our forum and fill out an application.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF0000"><b>Raid Participation - Currently
not required</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Before an applicant can be admitted for
membership, they will be expected to attend either some of our scheduled events,
informal xp groups or just do some plain old adventuring with our members.</font>
<font face="Arial" size="2">Please take a look at the <a href="http://www.myjeffmiller.com/eq/cgi-bin/calendar/calendar.pl">Foundation Rathe Raid Calendar</a>
to see what events we have coming up.&nbsp; If you plan on attending a scheduled
event you <b>must</b> contact me (Mithandriel) <b>prior</b> to the day of the
event to let me know you are attending. If I am not available, you can contact
any member of FR and let them know you are applying for membership and wish to
attend a specific raid(s) and they will then inform me.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">It will be the responsibility of the applicant to
stay informed and contact us about raids. We will not hunt people down to let
them know when and where we are raiding.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">There is no specific number of required raids
that need to be attended. That will vary by applicant and depend on how much you
interact with our members during the raid(s) and what type of impression you
make.&nbsp; In general, sponsored applicants are usually admitted after less
raids than a non-sponsored applicant.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Becoming a Probationary Membership</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The final decision whether to accept a member is
made by me and is based on sponsorship, input from members as well as my
impression of the applicant from our conversations.&nbsp; Once I determine that
the applicant is of acceptable caliber, they will become a probationary member.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The probationary period will last for 30 days
during which time the member will be further evaluated by me and the members of
the guild. It is expected while online, a probationary member will make every
effort to attend as many raids as possible as well as interact with other
members on non-raid days.&nbsp; The probationary member must also reach level 20
before they may become a full member.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A probationary member can be removed at the end
of the 30 day period or at an earlier time if they prove that they are not FR
material. Reasons why a probationary member would be removed can range from
breaking a guild rule (intentional KSing, training, camp stealing, etc.) or
failure to attend sufficient raids while online.&nbsp; The probationary period
may also be extended if the member is not online with enough frequency or does
not attend enough raids.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF0000"><b>Raid Points/Looting</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Loot decisions are based on a point system
however need is also taken into consideration.&nbsp; Members begin accumulating
points as soon as they are formally inducted into the guild as a probationary
member.&nbsp; Points are given for attending raids, participating in guild xp
groups, helping members as well as other reasons. Points are then deducted for
items that are awarded during a raid or &quot;purchased&quot; from the guild
vault.&nbsp; Probationary members may not &quot;purchase&quot; an item from the
guild vault and are only entitled to items that drop during a raid that they
attended.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">Dual Membership</font></b><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000" size="4"><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->
&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size="2">Members of Foundation Rathe are not permitted to have dual membership in any
competing guild. Members are permitted to have characters in other guilds that
we have formal or informal alliances with. Some exceptions may be
made with &quot;non-competing&quot; guilds and will be made on a case-by-case
basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Prospective members should indicate ANY current guild affiliations with any
characters they play prior to applying for membership and then a determination
will be made whether that dual membership will be acceptable or not.
</font>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><b>Level/Class Requirements</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">At this time, the level requirement for
joining Foundation Rathe is 15th level or comparable Everquest experience (i.e.
experience from other servers, higher level characters, etc.) .</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There is also no class restrictions either. We do
welcome all classes.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><b>General Information</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Epics</b> - Foundation Rathe is committed to
helping it's members complete their epic weapon quests as much as
possible.&nbsp; With that in mind there may be certain epics that may not be
able to be completed at this time or in the near future or other epics where
there are several members still waiting to complete theirs.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Velious Faction</b> - Foundation Rathe is
mainly aligned with the dwarves of Thurgadin and at war with the giants of Kael
Drakkel.&nbsp; Our main goal is the completion of the various Thurgadin
class-based armor quests as well as the Tunare quests found in the Plane of
Growth. We will also at times hunt in PoG however those of good alignment will
not be forced to ruin that faction.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As a secondary result of fighting the giants, we
are partially aligned with the Claws of Veeshan however we do hunt the dragons
of Velious at this time.&nbsp; It is expected at a later date when we decide to
hunt in the Temple of Veeshan that we will commit fully to the CoV faction.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Members of Foundation Rathe are expected to
improve their Thurgadin faction and actively work on the various quests
available there.&nbsp; If you have already improved your Kael Drakkel faction to
a point where you are able to do quests there and do not wish to change
factions, then that must be discussed with me during the admissions process.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Luclin</b> - At this time, there are no
specific faction plans that center around Luclin.&nbsp; As more information
becomes available about the various factions and the pros and cons of each
faction, a&nbsp; plan will be made at that time. We as a guild plan to explore
and adventure in the various Luclin zones in the near future.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Tips/What we expect</b> - I'll just give a few
ideas about what we look for and what is expected of people that wish to join
our guild.</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">What we look for:</font></p>

</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">We look for members that want to be part of a
    team/family based environment. With that in mind, we are looking for people
    that want to work together and adventure with their guild all the time and
    not only at the times that is beneficial to them.&nbsp; We expect the
    highest level of participation from our members as well as a commitment to
    the guild.&nbsp; It is only through team work and commitment that any guild
    will thrive.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">We look for mature members (this has nothing
    to do with chronological age). We want members that are mature enough to
    understand why things are done and why specific rules are in place. We also
    want members that will follow directions.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">FR fully supports the RTA and the various
    calendars and rotations that are set up for the mutual benefit of the Rathe
    community. Those members of the Rathe that do not want to abide by the rules
    laid out by RTA should seek another guild.</font></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">What we do not want:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">We do not want members that are only out for
    themselves or only join FR because they think they can receive loot or help
    on their agenda only.&nbsp; If you are someone that expects to receive
    priority in loot or must have your epic now, then FR is probably not the
    place for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">FR also believes strongly in appropriate
    player conduct. We do not support nor do we tolerate any form of kill
    stealing, camp stealing, intentional training, invoking PNP (except if no
    other solution can be found) or any other activity that is generally frowned
    upon by the Rathe community. If you are someone that has participated in
    these activities knowingly, then FR is probably not the guild for you.</font></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Some tips:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Be open and honest - If you had a bad
    reputation or had a falling out with your prior guild, then be open about
    it. Everyone has a past and while some are more colored than others, we try
    to give everyone the benefit of the doubt. Being honest shows that you want
    to get past that and be judged on who you are today.&nbsp; If something has
    happened in your past that we need to know about, we will probably find out
    eventually.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Be yourself - Don't try to act differently to
    impress people. Just be yourself and act accordingly. If you are the right
    fit for the guild that will show and everything will go much
    smoother.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Loot Whores - There is probably no bigger turn
    off than a loot whore. The first question of an invite should not be
    &quot;will I get loot.&quot; This only shows that you are more interested in
    getting loot than it is about you getting to know the guild.&nbsp; You may
    get loot but that should be of secondary concern to interacting and showing
    the guild what you are made of.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><b>Contact Information</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">You may contact me in game.&nbsp; I have many
alts however the best bet is to either look for Mithandriel or Meaoldar.&nbsp;
If you do not see either name then chances are I'm not online at that time. You
can also contact me by e-mail at <a href="mailto:Mithandriel@aol.com">Mithandriel@aol.com</a>.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I look forward to hearing from you.</font></p>
