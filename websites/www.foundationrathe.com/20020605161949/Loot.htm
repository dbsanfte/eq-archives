<p><b><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#0000FF">Foundation Rathe Loot Rules</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><b>Overview</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Looting is based on an integrated point system across all
classes.&nbsp; This system is commonly known as a &quot;Dragon Kill point&quot;
or DKP system.&nbsp; There are several different types of DKP systems. Some are
based on a bid system where members bid points and the highest bidder receives
the item. There are also straight point systems where the person with the
highest point total receives the item. Foundation Rathe uses a modified straight
point system where need is also factored into the equation.&nbsp; This will be
explained below.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><b>Accumulating points</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">A member will receive points for various guild
activities.&nbsp; These activities range from general raid points, XP groups to
specific &quot;kill&quot; points.&nbsp; The points will be described below.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">General Raid - .40 per hour</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">XP group - .50 points per day (must have at least 4 guild
members for a minimum of 2 hours)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Helping a guildmate with epic progress or completing a
quest - .25 points
(assuming this is something that only requires 1-2 groups or less).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Kill Points - These will vary by the specific target and
will only be awarded for successful slaying of that target.&nbsp; The value of
the specific NPC will be based on the difficulty as well as importance of that
NPC (loot, quest implications, etc.).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Members will also receive points for trading in items or
donating items to the guild (assuming the items have value)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Point values may change over time as certain NPCs lose
their importance or become easier to defeat</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><b>Using points</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Any time an item is awarded, the member will lose points.
Item values will vary based on the rarity of the item, fair market value,
tradeable/No Drop status as well as the benefit that item provides.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Some general point values</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Planar BP/Robe - 8 points</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Thurgadin/PoG BP/Robe - 10 points</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Amulet of Necropotence - 15 points</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><b>How loot is awarded</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Whenever an item drop occurs, the person in charge of
looting (generally the guildleader however it can also be a class leader or raid
coordinator) will make the decisions based on three factors:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial">Member point totals</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Need</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Benefit to the guild</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Arial">When the item drops the member will inform the loot
officer that they are interested in the item. They must also inform the officer
what the item will be replacing.&nbsp; The loot officer will then review the
point totals of all members interested then determine who is eligible. From that
point, the officer will determine based on need as well as benefit who will
receive that item.&nbsp; In cases where the point totals are relatively close,
the item will generally be awarded to the person with the most need.&nbsp; Some
items have specific value to a certain class and in those cases the item will be
awarded to that class even if a member of another class that can use the item
has a higher point total</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Some examples of how the system works:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Example 1 - Need</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Caster A has 30 points and has a plane level robe. Caster
B has 25 points but no plane level robe.&nbsp; A caster robe drops that is
useable by both casters and has no special innate benefit to the guild (i.e. an
ability that would make encounters/raids easier). The robe would be a slight
upgrade to Caster A but a large upgrade to Caster B. In this case Caster B would
receive the item due to need even though Caster A had a slight point advantage.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Example 2 - Point difference</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Take the same two casters from the first example but in
this case Caster B only has 5 points. In this case the robe would be awarded to
Caster A because they had amassed a much higher number of points than Caster B.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Example 3 - Benefit to the guild</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">A Wizard has 30 points. A Necromancer has 10 points. They
both have comparable robes. A quest robe drops in Kael Arena that is useable by
both.&nbsp; Even though the Wizard has a substantial point difference over the
Necromancer, the robe would be awarded to the Necromancer because it would allow
him to cast Conjure corpse which would have a very large benefit to the guild.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Even though this does not cover every possible scenario, I
hope it gives you an idea of how items are determined.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><b>How are raid/item values determined?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Generally the value of a mob and the items that are
dropped are valued so that the total DKP gained = total item DKP awarded.&nbsp;
This is done to stop inflation/deflation which can cause this type of system to
become invalid.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">For example:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Mob A has a loot pool of 8 items. On average the mob drops
3 items per killing with the average DKP item value of 10 for a total of 30 DKP.
This mob takes 30 people to kill.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">(Average Item DKP&nbsp; * Number of items dropped)/Number
needed to kill NPC = NPC DKP</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">(10 * 3)/30 = 1</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Items that are random drops cannot be calculated this way
but can be calculated based on their value relative to other items.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Please keep in mind that both item values and raid values
will vary over time and can be changed at any time based on need, value and
availability.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><b>Alternate Characters, Playing Multiple
characters at once</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">One point total will be maintained for each member no
matter how many alternate characters they have. Any time a guild member
participates in an event regardless of it they play their primary or an
alternate they will receive points. Alternates are entitled to loot on raids
however they will have secondary consideration over primaries.&nbsp; In some
cases, an alternate may be given looting privileges over a primary if the member
has a distinct point advantage over the other member (most of that time this
will only apply to probationary members), the alternate is of need to the guild
or that person was specifically asked to play that alternate at a specific
raid.&nbsp; Points will be deducted from the members total for any item awarded
to any alternate character.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Players may purchase items from the guild vault for their
alternates however the item must be in the vault for no less than 3 weeks and
only if no primary&nbsp; has expressed interest in the item. If more than one
member is interested in the item, the relative level of the alternate will be
considered as well as the point totals of each member.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">E.g. - The guld vault has a Lamentation in it and two
members express interest in the item for their alternates. The point totals are
relatively close. One member has a 25th level warrior and the other has a 40th
level ranger. The item would be given to the member with the 40th level ranger
because their character is of a much closer level to where you would be able to
obtain and benefit from the item.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Players with multiple accounts/computers that can play
more than one character at a time will be allowed to and will receive a bonus to
their point total for that raid. Anyone that plays more than one character will
be given .5 point multiplier per character during the raid (i.e. if you played
two characters at a raid for 4 hours you would receive 2.4 points instead of 1.6
(.4*4*1.5=2.4)).&nbsp; Please keep in mind that if there is a limitation on
group space, a member may only be able to play one character even if they have
the ability to play more than one.</font></p>
