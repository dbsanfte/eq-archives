DR is not a power/raid guild and as such we do not have plans for active recruitment.  However, we would like to provide a home for our friends.  The only requirements for membership are a main that is 50+ and sponsorship by a member of our guild.  Those who would like to sponsor a new member of the DR family must adhere to the following guidelines:<br><br>1.  Prospective Members must post in the Recruitment forum.  Tell a little bit about themselves and why they would like to join the DR family<br><br>2.  The member sponsoring this person must post in the Prospect Review forum.  It’s requested that the name of the applicant be used in the title of the post - including any alts that are played frequently.  Although recruitment isn’t based on class or lvl (beyond the min 50+ main requirement), please include their class and lvl for identification purposes.<br><br>3.  The prospective member must either group with an officer OR participate in a guild raid/event<br><br>4.  Members are responsible for adding posts to each sponsorship thread, either supporting or denying membership.  In order to respond to prospective members in a timely manner, DR members will have 3 days to approve/deny each sponsorship thread after step 3 is met.  ONE dissenting vote excludes a prospective member from joining the DR family.  However, it is requested that those denying membership explain why they feel this person would not be an attribute to the guild.  We believe that it’s important that there is 100% approval from guild members to prevent discord within the guild<br><br>5.  Once all of the above are met, the prospective member must contact the recruitment officer for an invite or denial of membership<br><br>6. New members will be placed on a temporary invite basis for ONE month.  This period will give each of us a chance to get to know the new member.  During this probationary period temp members will not have access to items in the guild vault or request guild raid/epic assistance.  At the end of the one month trial period all members will vote on whether the new member will become a permanent invite.  The sponsor is required to post in the Guild Talk forum and each of us will have the opportunity to once again accept or decline membership.   DR members will have 3 days to respond to this post.  For those who would like to remain anonymous, they may contact the requirement officer with their concerns.  Again, 100% approval is required to gain permanent membership<br><br>7.  Applicant is contacted by the recruitment officer and notified of their membership status<br><br>It is each member’s responsibility to check the boards regularly, in particular the Prospect Review forum.  If you do not respond within the three day posting period - your vote will be considered as approval<br><br>If prospective members are applying for membership in other guilds it is expected that they inform the recruitment officer.  This will not have an effect on your recruitment status; however, not informing the recruitment officer may result in termination of your application.  <br><br>* The Guidleader, as in all decisions, has absolute and final authority in all guild-related matters.  Therefore, she may assign or deny membership as she deems necessary <br><br>If you have questions please contact <br><br>Chatnoir/Cazi<br>Recruitment Officer<br>Chatloire@hotmail.com<br> <p>Chatnoir<BR>58 DE Cleric<BR>Officer Dark Rapture</p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/fdarkrapturefrm6.threadControl?topicID=1.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/blueMoon/deleteThread.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/fdarkrapturefrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/fdarkrapturefrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub45.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="darkrapturefrm5">Officers' Mess<option value="darkrapturefrm6">Recruitment<option value="darkrapturefrm7">Questions & Comments<option value="darkrapturefrm8">Chatter Away Here<option value="darkrapturefrm9">The Vault<option value="darkrapturefrm10">Phat Lewt Awarded<option value="darkrapturefrm11">Wish List<option value="darkrapturefrm12">Upcoming Events<option value="darkrapturefrm13">Open Events<option value="darkrapturefrm14">Prospect Review<option value="darkrapturefrm15">Guild Talk<option value="darkrapturefrm16">Sell Yer Junk<option value="darkrapturefrm17">Welcome<option value="darkrapturefrm18">Talk to Us<option value="darkrapturefrm19">Event Ideas<option value="darkrapturefrm23">Who We Are</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8080FF>- </font><a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/bdarkrapture>Dark Rapture</a><font color=#8080FF> - </font><a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/fdarkrapturefrm6>Recruitment</a> <font color=#8080FF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
