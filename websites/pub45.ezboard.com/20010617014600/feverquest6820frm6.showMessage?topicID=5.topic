All non-elves in range were attacked after failing to depart the premises.  Several pitched battles ensued (please add your details in replys).<br>
<br>
For my part I managed to dispatch 2 dwarves and assisted in several other punitive actions.  My pet chased a third off the platform edge (to my chagrin - had to depart for awhile to find the pet again).  AND to top off the evening I was petitioned by one of the dwarves for killing him on his corpse run (I watched him standing naked having a conversation with another non-guilded elf for several minutes - shooting the breeze.  I was not aware that he was on a corpse run because of his actions - he was certainly not making a beeline to the body - also note that this occurred at the top of the PoD lift).  At any rate I have logs and screenshots if it gets blown out of purportion.<br>
I was finally felled by a human named Nickolsan who conn'd red to me.  A good (if short) fight nontheless - he had good magic resistance because my pet was totally ineffectual.<br>

/em emits several smoke rings from his rune-carved pipe.  A vengful smile creases his face...<br>

Helped chase out several heathens from the city today.  Two of them jumped to thier death rather than face me in combat (giggles).  My stay was cut short by Rezzor(sp?) a dwarf that conned red to me.  I could not normally PvP with him, but he offered me a duel which I accepted.  I managed to do 50% damage on him before he dispatched me after killing my fire pet (mucho caliente).  I kept him jumping for a good minute after the pet died, and probably could have escaped but I stayed and took my lumps. <p>Dorkmid

I witnessed several pyrotechnic jousts between our higher level members/guild leaders and the enemy.<br>
<br>
I was killed early on by Horsefeet - a barbarian that con'd red to me - I had him running around the platform after me as my pet kept chipping away at him.  He was a bit slow, and for much of the time I was able to stay in his blind spot.  However his superior armor and strength turned the tide as he got several blows in passing that sent me reeling and ultimately down for the count.<br>
<br>
I scooted for 1 hour and camped the trainer in CB.  I killed the trainer 4 times and none of them droped the shield (one time when I was level 9 I saw two of my buddies kill 2 trainers back to back BOTH of which dropped the shield - 1 for each of them.  I have killed that *^%$*&amp;^ trainer probably 30 times since then to no avail - but I AM GOING TO KEEP ON UNTIL I GET IT!  This was the first 'quest' item I ever went after, and I want it bad....even though I can't use the thing, its the principle that counts...grrr)<br>
<br>
I returned to the bank platform, only to find a Eurodite SK (i think) named Scotoxin - I asked him to leave nicely, and he gave me some lip.  So, I asked him again nicely, with a few 'our policy is that this city is to be for elfs ONLY' and 'all Heathens must leave our sacred city at once' etc...(not exact quotes so don't sue me).  At any rate he made no move to leave, and I sicked my pet on him.  He fought back a little as several others jumped in, and we nuked him down.  He returned almost immediately....and asked me for a bind - whilst naked, standing next to his body.  I read him the riot act, and told him to LnS...he decided to camp naked next to his corpse.  I enlisted the help of the guild to punish him a little, and my pet killed him again.  The third time - he came back, looted his corpse and then ran into the building next to the bank.  I went in and told him to leave the city....He laughed at me , and sent me tells OOC that indicated his disrespect for our guild and our policies.  I attacked him once again at that point and gave him a dirt nap for his yapping.  I got a request to duel from /con red 'Niesa' wood elf - which I declined - she must be his friend.  She should tell him to roll an elf if he wants to hang out at the bank in Kelethin.<br>
<br>
The fourth time, he came back, looted his corpse, then hung around talking to some people.  At about this time Kassidy of &lt;Lucid Hope&gt; showed up and began telling me that what I did was wrong, and I was lucky she was an elf, and that she had friends who would be able to kill me....yada yada yada...  I gave her the standard speach and berated her for being an X-teaming traitor to the elven cause.  She went completely out of charactor and sent me /tell's that I was a 'punk' and was going to die - and later on I overheard her plotting with fellow guildmates, and the passage of 100pp between hands (hmmm - so what I did was reprehensible, yet she was willing to put out a contract on my avatar's life - does the word 'hypocricy' apply to this case?).  I never thought I would be worth 100pp woot!  While this was going on I saw that Kattria was laying into Scotoxin once again.  She had a few problems, though, when he would do his pattented 'run into a building and hide' routine, and was not able to give him the stomping he deserved.<br>
<br>
I finally stepped in and my pet chased him somewhere before I could follow and killed him ('Taunting Attacker Master....Taunting Attacker Master...' heheh).  But, he was like the proverbial rubber ball that keeps bouncing back...  He showed up for a 5th installment, and /rude'd me, then went into the bank, and shortly came back out, and began to med while him and a few others sent me smack-talk /tell's, and wrong interpretations of the rules (I was harrassing Scotoxin according to these folks - ok, and what HE was doing was.....not?).  I noticed that he was buffing up, or someone was buffing him up, so I began chain-casting 'dispel magic'.  After about 15 casts - with medding in between...he attacked me; I wonder why he did *that*?  There is hope for him yet!  He got in a few good strikes of his long sword...but I had him outgunned, and chased him to the POD lift platform where he died in a ball of flames.  After that I did not see him any more...maybe he finally got the message?  We can only hope. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub45.ezboard.com/udorkmid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorkmid</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10> at: 2/19/01 1:58:36 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub45.ezboard.com/udorkmid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorkmid</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#660000>(2/20/01 1:47:54 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Butt Handed to me On a Platter...</span><hr size=1> Tonight the forces of good took a bit of a pounding.  Was attacked by Human Dawkin(sp?) in CB Throne Room.  Beat him down with the help of my mates.  Also had a naked player named Softo(sp?) train the TR mob on us...we managed to kill most of the mob before we had to run.  Then, another player trained Ambassador D'Vinn on us.  Death all around, but I managed to get out somehow.<br>
<br>
After that I was leaving and was acosted by an Ogre SK that slapped a harm touch on me...I managed to chase him out of the zone due primarily to my pet.  Then I entered a PvP fight with an Erudite and a Gnome - which was a close fight, but I ended up victorious and a bit richer.  The Erudite was the same one that I had trouble with at the bank the day before...After this I went home to Kelethin low on everything.<br>
<br>
Went to the bank after medding up and began to patrol the area.  Fell off the platform to my death after a Erudite Wizard attacked me, and I miss-stepped (due to lag) and plummeted down...  I came back and assaulted a con yellow human druid who was being healed by X-team elf.  Then the Erudite Wizard Nohtyr again attacked me as I was at 1/2 strength and put me down finally with 4 rounds of combat....<br>
<br>
All in all a rough night.  I am also begining to be attacked simply because of my guild-tag which I wear proudly - keep the faith all. <p>Dorkmid

<br>
Last night the Illuvitae membership coordinated attacks on the forces of darkness within our faire city to great effect.  Many non-elfs fell to our blades and were burned by our spells.  A large contingent of Erudites were in attendance tonight, many of them out of range to me.  <br>
<br>
I did manage to kill a dwarf warrior that attacked and killed my pet several times.  This one took a dirt-nap for several of our guildmates as well due to improper PvP etiquette; I shall mention no names.<br>
<br>
Crush Bone was also scene to some fierce PvP.  A team composed of an Iksar, Human, and Ogre roamed the zone and killed elves on site (/con'd red to me).   The Iksar jumped me in the Throne Room, and fought long and hard with healing being performed by our own Zantana for our side, and some other healer (possibly the human) for the Iksar.  I unfortunately died during my escape when the Ogre and human beat me unconscious, and I took an exp loss to an orc who also agro'd on me in the midst of the battle.  My team mates were able to avenge my death and kill the Iksar - which also netted some platinum for our Ranger.  Good work guys. <p>Dorkmid

Killed a barbarian that was sitting on the platform after asking him nicely to depart the city.  His response to my instruction was to hit me (I was happily surprised), at which point I beat him down.  He must have been a monk or a warrior because it took forever to kill him.  After I dispatched him, he reappeared in less than 30 seconds and began hitting me again right next to his body.  I was at 1 bubble mana and 2/3 strength, and asked him to Loot and Scoot as I called off my pet.  He again hit me.  And again I asked him nicely to leave and called off my pet.  He hit me again. <br>
<br>
I repeated this several more times; then I got fed up and decided to take him out again.  I knew I wouldn't be able to nuke him down, so I decided to joust him and let my pet do most of the work.  Round and round the platform we went.  For what seemed like 5 minutes we circled and my pet meted out some damage, and I would swoop in and crush him for 1 point of damage, with a cast or two in between when my mana would regenerate enough.  Finally he dropped for the second time.  I informed him at this point that I was petitioning him, which I did.  He did not return after this.  A GM has not come to me yet regarding this incident.<br>
<br>
I then picked a fight with an Erudite warrior with uber looking gear that con'd white to me.  After I asked him to leave, he immediately attacked me.  I tried the same tactics on him, but he had SoW on, and I was not able to get many casts off before he knocked me down.  I was only able to break away a few times, and probably should have run, but I decided to stick it out on principle.  His weapon did 30 pts damage on average and several times more; he rarely missed.  I told him 'good fight warrior'.  He called me a retard.  Par for the course, I'm afraid.  He did get the drop on me; however, I should have cast cancel magic when I had the chance to strip his buffs.  Instead I opted to nuke which killed me.  Lesson learned. <p>Dorkmid

His verbal attack was based on me asking him to leave the city.  It seems to be a typical response whether you win or lose a battle: 'Why did you attack me?  Can't you see I am trying to trade here? Your a &lt;insert explative here&gt;' <p>Dorkmid

I am not in the guild but I have attempted to take out a few vermin from out forest.  So far I have come up empty handed.  What I have noticed so far is that a true newb to this server (as in no equip) isnt easy to take down a twink opponent.  I am a lvl 7 rogue, i was able to save up enough to buy a FS dagger, but what ends up happening is i attack, they run, and whine about why im doing this.  While chasing them i maybe get a hit for 1 damage here and there.  Generally when happens next is they, run for help and I get killed (hehe) or others help me and I dont get the kill. A few times I have gone toe to toe, and while im able to inflict some damage and evade alot of theirs, it usually catches up with me, ending in my demise. lol.<br>
<br>
i will continue to plug away and bring glory to our nation.<br>

Chased another /con yellow Barbarian shaman from the platform; the kill was stolen from me by the efforts of a group of x-teamers who healed and buffed him...I still managed to get him to within 1/2 bubble of life...and with SoW on him he was still moving extremely slow.  My mana finally ran out and my pet died.  He made it to the PoD lift platform and I gave up as I was petless and oom.  It was a sight to behold - 6 elves surrounding the barbarian shaman all casting at once, just because of little old me.  After I medded back up, I mis-stepped coming out of a building on the platform above the bank and fell to my death (damn lag).  The PvP casters nerf kicked in and I lost all of my mana - grrr - my friends then hailed me and I decided to cut my losses and take the fight to other zones.<br>
<br>
Went on to CB and killed a few Legionaires with friends after finding the TR camped (gotta make sure the orcs know who's boss), then we moved on to Unrest.  Many evil undead tasted our blades and burned under our spells this night. <p>Dorkmid

[Thu Mar 01 20:17:54 2001] Sorinson says, 'One more spell and i shall leave'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:17:54 2001] Veleno was pierced by thorns.<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:17:57 2001] You say, 'play nice rules - please explain yoiurself sorinson'<br>

[Thu Mar 01 20:18:37 2001] Veleno says, 'This will be your last waening'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:18:39 2001] Glug, glug, glug . Nasier takes a swig of Honey Mead.<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:18:43 2001] Rathen bows before Veleno.<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:18:45 2001] Nasier needs more beer.<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:18:46 2001] Sorinson tells you, 'Please allow me to finish and proceed on my cr.'<br>
...<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:19:05 2001] Veleno was pierced by thorns.<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:19:07 2001] You say, 'Sorinson you do not have the right to mem your spells on a corpse run - a corpse run is just that - moving to your corpse - be gone with you'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:19:15 2001] Veleno begins to cast a spell.<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:19:17 2001] Sorinson has been ensnared.<br>

[Thu Mar 01 20:19:23 2001] You say, 'or Veleno here will finish you'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:19:24 2001] Sorinson is slammed by an intense gust of wind.<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:19:28 2001] Veleno begins to cast a spell.<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:19:29 2001] Sorinson singes as the Burst of Fire hits them.<br>

[Thu Mar 01 20:20:02 2001] Veleno says, 'We gave him more then ample time to elave'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:20:28 2001] You say, 'Sorinson was sending me tells about the play nice rules - '<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:20:51 2001] You say, 'he does not have the right to mem his spells - he needs to move on'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:20:59 2001] Sorinson says, 'You are reported and petitioned against, nice work boys and girls.'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:21:24 2001] Rathen says, 'Reported and petitioned for what, exactly?'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:21:27 2001] You say, 'you do not have a leg to stand on Sorinson.  Now Loot your corpse and move along.'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:21:35 2001] Sorinson tells you, 'Now i get to start over again. if you attack it wont be interfering with a cr, it will be corpse camping.'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:21:56 2001] Sorinson says, 'Interfering with a cr.'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:22:00 2001] Modas says, 'Man you illuvitae are harsh.'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:22:07 2001] Modas says, 'Reminds me of the shanks'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:22:13 2001] Rathen says, 'CR is a privelege, not a right.'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:22:18 2001] Sorinson says, 'Not for long, they be out of eq.'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:22:27 2001] You say, 'Sorinson just sent me a tell that said - 'now i get to start over again. if you attack mit wont be interfering with a cr, it will be corpse camping...lol'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:22:40 2001] Sorinson says, 'Rathe, you might want to read those play nice rules, you could be banned for what you did.'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:23:09 2001] You say, 'don't think so -'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:23:48 2001] Verak is looking at your equipment...<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:23:54 2001] Sorinson says, 'The crazy thing is that i would have been gone twice if you hadnt interefereed with my last spell mem.'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:24:07 2001] You say, 'why don'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:24:27 2001] You say, 't you just move along and mem them elsewhere =- hello???'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:25:15 2001] Sorinson bows before Dorkmid.<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:25:17 2001] Sorinson waves at Dorkmid.<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:25:21 2001] You wave.<br>
<br>
- He finally left at that suggestion...heh<br>
<br>
I then proceeded to wreak havoc on more foreigners that were in range.  Xiphias was my next target, apparently with his sweetheart at the bank - an elf named Symaria.  After the obligatory warning, I engaged him.  He was a human - not much of a fight - I think my pet killed him.  He went running like a little girl as soon as my pet started blasting him.  His girlfriend summed it all up:<br>
<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:31:37 2001] Symaria says, 'You people have a major attitude problem'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:31:49 2001] Symaria says, 'I am trying to give things to my man and you kill him'<br>
<br>
After the 'battle', he queried me:<br>
<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:39:20 2001] Xiphias tells you, 'Why do you want me gone so much?'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:40:02 2001] You told Xiphias, '- nothing personal you are just on the human team - I have to remove you from the city '<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:40:14 2001] Xiphias tells you, 'Says who?'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:40:14 2001] Morphios regards you indifferently -- what would you like your tombstone to say?<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:40:22 2001] Xiphias tells you, 'I wish to talk'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:40:36 2001] Xiphias tells you, 'Diplomicy is far More civilized'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:41:09 2001] You told Xiphias, '- this is a 4 team server - you are on the wrong team to be here - this server is for PvP - I also warned you and gave you ample time to leave - diplomacy enough.'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:41:40 2001] Xiphias tells you, 'I know this is PvP I have higher Characters on here'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:41:52 2001] Xiphias tells you, 'So basically, You havre no reason'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:42:53 2001] You told Xiphias, '- do your business elsewhere - our philosophy is that the other races have dirtied our lands and we want them gone - that is how we are going to play it whether you like it or not...'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:43:25 2001] Xiphias tells you, 'All of you? I hear just one you'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:44:01 2001] Xiphias tells you, 'You are trying to pass yourself by as rightous when your just a PK'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:44:33 2001] You told Xiphias, 'everyone in my guild feels this way - there are many other elves who would X-team and exploit the game mechanics to undernine team PvP - we do not and will not...'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:45:19 2001] Xiphias tells you, 'Your guild Is nothing but a Bunch of Lowlife Pk's, EXCEPT a Few'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:46:17 2001] Xiphias tells you, 'I dont see the rest of the elves kicking me out I see most complying'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:46:22 2001] You told Xiphias, 'I hope you're not refering to me.  I enjoy PvP - but I am not a Psychotic Killer -I do it for a reason.'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:47:06 2001] You told Xiphias, '- just because everyone jumps off a bridge is it something you want to do?  Does it make it right?'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:47:13 2001] Xiphias tells you, 'IS that true? If you were honorable you would not kill me again'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:47:33 2001] Xiphias tells you, 'The situation is critical in that situation'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:47:50 2001] You told Xiphias, 'BS - if you decide to stay here after you get your corpse I will kill you again.'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:48:09 2001] You told Xiphias, 'You then, would not be the one being honorable.'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:48:17 2001] Xiphias tells you, 'Talk to your guild mate Alayen, he is honorable'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:49:07 2001] You told Xiphias, 'I have spoken to him on occaision - and you are trying to tell me that he would not enforce LootNscoot - BS.'<br>
<br>
... then Sorinson came back to haunt me:<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:49:17 2001] Sorinson tells you, 'Ok, now that i am all in one piece, would you mind a quick ooc conversation about the bank debacle?'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:50:06 2001] You told Sorinson, 'I am busy - talk to yourself...'<br>
<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:49:36 2001] Xiphias tells you, 'Unless they attack him again'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:51:54 2001] You told Xiphias, 'that is his business then, I would not do that if someone wants to be difficult.  The LnS rule is in place to represent that I won the battlefield from you for a short period of time - usually 1 hour.  If you dis-honor this then you deserve'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 20:52:04 2001] You told Xiphias, 'to be killed again.'<br>
<br>
Seems like everyone I kill wants to give me some lip.  <br>
<br>
Keetar - a druid in wolf form - struck up a conversation with me, and I saw here a little later engage a group of humans - I decided to take out the one that looked like he was attacking her...name of Llaor - my pet made mince meat of him and finished him off - no faction hit for me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Keetar continued to fight a guy named Hitmonlee - he conned red to me but I decided to give her a hand, and blasted him a little.  Slapped a DS on Keetar, but the group of hummies gated through a portal before they could be fully engaged.<br>
<br>
Next was a gnome named Kiblior I found in the bank:<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:01:04 2001] Kiblior regards you indifferently -- looks kind of dangerous.<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:01:09 2001] You say, 'You are stinking up my city, Kiblior.  Leave at once.'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:01:18 2001] You say, 'Kiblior , your presence in our faire city is an abomination'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:01:18 2001] You say, 'Leave at once!'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:01:25 2001] Kiblior sighs at Dorkmid.<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:01:26 2001] Kiblior waves goodbye to Dorkmid.<br>
... at which point he ran outside...<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:01:56 2001] You say, 'You are stinking up my city, Kiblior.  Leave at once.'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:02:16 2001] You say, 'Burn evil one....'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:02:18 2001] You begin casting Shock of Flame.<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:02:18 2001] You say, 'Burn evil one....'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:02:20 2001] Kiblior's skin ignites.<br>
...and on this went for a while...<br>
Unfortunately my pet took the kill - KSing pet!<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:02:39 2001] Kiblior has been slain by Kekn!<br>
...then my old friend Xiphias pipes in again...<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:04:42 2001] Xiphias tells you, 'How come you dont try to kill Jormum'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:05:23 2001] You told Xiphias, 'I have not seen him - where is he?'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:05:37 2001] Xiphias tells you, 'Hes by Orc lift, lvl 20+'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:06:36 2001] Xiphias tells you, 'Or can you only attack Greens?'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:07:36 2001] You told Xiphias, 'I have attacked all kinds - save it for some other time - if you want to jump me I am at the bank...'<br>
<br>
After this - I find, what I think is a human monk in the bank...turned out to be a Wizard - conned yellow to me:<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:15:06 2001] You say, 'Aklas , your presence in our faire city is an abomination'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:15:06 2001] You say, 'Leave at once!'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:15:20 2001] You say, 'You are stinking up my city, Aklas.  Leave at once.'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:15:24 2001] Fhenix tells the guild, 'Did I just see Dorkmid's corpse lying here in Unrest?'<br>
^^If there was one there it was from about a week ago...but I looted it, so - don't know...?<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:15:24 2001] Zillis says, 'Hail'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:15:30 2001] Auto attack on.<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:15:31 2001] Aklas's skin freezes.<br>
^^pet began attacking here<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:15:37 2001] Zillis tells you, 'Selling your skull of jhan tra?'<br>
^^wtf??  Some people have no sense of timing...<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:15:55 2001] Aklas says, 'This aint ur city'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:15:57 2001] You crush Aklas for 9 points of damage.<br>
^^wow that was lucky - I very rarely get above 3 pts of damage on my melee weapon...heheh<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:16:25 2001] You told zillis, '-no'<br>
...^^I still managed to answer him in the middle of the fight <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
To make a long story short he began nuking me....and I put him down:<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:17:43 2001] You have slain Aklas!<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:17:43 2001] Your faction standing with most humans has gotten worse.<br>
^^Yes! Finally got some negative faction...<br>
<br>
Now this guy gives me some of his mouth with an interesting hightlight:<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:21:24 2001] Aklas tells you, 'Lol if ur gonna roleplay . felwithe is ur city hehe i will aveng lol fellow wizzie )'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:22:18 2001] You told Aklas, '- well fought - my pet loved the taste of combat with you.'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:22:50 2001] Aklas tells you, 'Ahh that was pet lol . i thought it was elf behind me lol'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:23:35 2001] Aklas tells you, 'Ahh that wasnt well fought on my behalf next time i was tryin to sell some stuff to my sister who has a wood elf .'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:24:03 2001] Aklas tells you, 'But now i know u like roleplayin )'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:24:22 2001] You told Aklas, '- lol - You con'd yellow to me - I thought I was a gonner when you opened up - at first I thought you were a monk - I was expecting a beating....Just know that you stinky hummies are KOS here.'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:25:32 2001] Aklas tells you, 'Lol ok  '<br>
...and that was the last of that .... (or so i thought - we shall return to Aklas a little later)<br>
<br>
My next target was a Eruidite enchanter (i think) named Nyarlatothep:<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:27:33 2001] Nyarlatothep regards you indifferently -- looks like quite a gamble.<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:28:02 2001] You say, 'Nyarlatothep , your presence in our faire city is an abomination'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:28:03 2001] You say, 'Leave at once!'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:28:08 2001] Nyarlatothep says, 'Salut tiger'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:28:23 2001] Nyarlatothep says, 'Hehe'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:28:25 2001] You say, 'Nyarlatothep , your presence in our faire city is an abomination'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:28:25 2001] You say, 'Leave at once!'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:28:42 2001] You say, 'You are stinking up my city, Nyarlatothep.  Leave at once.'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:28:47 2001] Adraro tells you, 'You name suts you well'<br>
^^please learn to spell if you are going to insult someone properly...<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:28:53 2001] Auto attack on.<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:28:59 2001] Nyarlatothep says, 'I give somethinf to a friend'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:28:59 2001] You crush Nyarlatothep for 1 point of damage.<br>
^^woot! 1pt of damage!!!<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:29:01 2001] Auto attack off.<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:29:15 2001] Adraro makes a rude gesture at Dorkmid.<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:29:21 2001] Adraro makes a rude gesture at Dorkmid.<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:29:26 2001] Adraro begins to cast a spell.<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:29:26 2001] You feel your aggression subside.<br>
^^great - another elf X-teamer sticks it to me...<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:29:33 2001] Sharda bows before Dorkmid.<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:29:38 2001] Sharda snaps to attention and salutes Dorkmid crisply.<br>
^^thanks Sharda - that really got my moral back up there...<br>
...Then all hell broke loose:<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:29:49 2001] Taunting Attacker Master.<br>

[Thu Mar 01 21:30:12 2001] You say, 'Burn evil one....'<br>

[Thu Mar 01 21:40:33 2001] Aklas tells you, 'And it is not considered corpse campin if u tell them to LnS and they dont and u kill them'<br>

[Thu Mar 01 21:44:14 2001] Aklas tells you, 'But it is but a game . donot think that attackin someone unprovoked may make u target as soon as they get corpse'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:44:43 2001] Aklas tells you, 'Lol err worded that wrong but u get my drift'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:45:16 2001] You told Aklas, '- there is some money on my corpse - I left it there for the one who vanquished me - '<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:45:29 2001] Aklas tells you, 'I dont mind being pk'd . if i did i d go to blue serfer dont get me wrong i m not ydnpnb atall at u killin me . but do expect in the game i come back for u  '<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:45:56 2001] Aklas tells you, 'Nahh bro . i dont loot keep it u ll need for spells believe me'<br>
^^That was nice of him....ahhhh...<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:46:31 2001] Aklas tells you, 'Thats why i sell stuff to my 44 yr old sister on the game . give her money in RL but in game . LOL'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:46:34 2001] You told Aklas, '- but that is bind rushing - I won the area fair and square - you should have scooted and then come back later if you wanted to contest the area again...this is not kosher.'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:47:52 2001] Aklas tells you, 'But attackin unprovoked can be considered unfair i wasnot prepared u couldve stood over me lootin and told me to leave if i didnot then u can attack but if i choose to stay after and get killed again or kill u that is my progative'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:49:01 2001] Aklas tells you, 'Bind rushin was an SK with harm touch or monk who needs no armor . problem . this scootin for an hour is a maded up deal . its not verant or bannable game policy'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:49:24 2001] You told Aklas, 'YOU ARE ON THE OTHER TEAM...there is no 'provocation' - the server is set up for 4 teams - I don't need a reason to kill you though I did give you a warning and ask you to leave out of courtesy...'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:50:09 2001] Aklas tells you, 'Ok . then i can come back as soon as i m prepared and attack u . at anytime there is no rule in stone i must leave .'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:50:21 2001] You told Aklas, '- but it is enforced by GMs and they have explained the reasoning behind it several times in chat - I have seen it.'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:50:56 2001] Aklas tells you, 'Not the 1 hour rule . what is enforced is corpse campin not allowin 1 to loot'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:51:12 2001] You are out of food and drink.<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:51:18 2001] You told Aklas, '- that means if you are a warrior - you can come back immediately full strength and attack me right after I fight you and am low on mana and strength myself'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:53:25 2001] Aklas tells you, 'No . if he can looot his stuff then he can . but if u kill warrior . dont stick around because chances are they will attack again'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:54:08 2001] You are out of food and drink.<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:54:49 2001] Aklas tells you, 'It s a game bro pls remember . the courtesies are player made . if u dont like dyin then go to non pvp . but noone fights fair here . the rules are simple must allow somone to get there corpse and leave . if they want'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:54:53 2001] You told Aklas, 'That is bind rushing - why do you think they nerfed the casters - when I die in PvP i lose all my mana - that is to discourage bind rushing - melees don't get this penalty - hello??? This is so obvious to me...'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:55:59 2001] You told Aklas, '- well we do regulate ourselves - be prepared to be KOS to every guild member  - That is all I have to say on this...'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:56:30 2001] Aklas tells you, 'Exactly so how could i bind rush when i have to port from HH mem all my spells run to bank in Felwithe med up loot my corpse how long that take me . huh . geezes . i didnt gmksp u killin me . take it  '<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:56:56 2001] Aklas tells you, 'Ok friend wha is the name of guild . so we can set up war with my guild )'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:57:19 2001] Aklas tells you, 'Now we roleplayin )'<br>
^^I love that last line...<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:58:08 2001] You told Aklas, '- Illuvitae - we don't need to set anything up - my guild already knows about the situation; just be prepared to die.'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:58:31 2001] Aklas tells you, 'Ok mine does too . Shield of Honor'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:59:15 2001] Aklas tells you, 'We kill unprovoked attackers and pk's only . we have no racial probs cept darkies  '<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:59:25 2001] You say to your guild, '- we are KOS to 'Shield of Honor' - I apparently pissed off thier main man...'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 21:59:37 2001] Lerdar tells the guild, 'So'<br>
^^Calm under pressure - I like that in a guild-buddy...heh<br>
[Thu Mar 01 22:00:45 2001] You say to your guild, 'here is thier charter as paraphrased:  We kill unprovoked attackers and PK's only. We have no racial probs cept darkies ---- Damn X-teamers...'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 22:10:12 2001] Aklas tells you, 'Just talked to GM buddy of my son . he laughed . said i did nothin wrong peace bro . remember u drew first blood . u drew first blood .'<br>
^^Oh, now this is getting interesting...<br>
[Thu Mar 01 22:13:00 2001] Fhenix tells the guild, 'R there any humans that should be treated with respect since we do have some Half Elves who have some human parents? remember, an RP question) 8P'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 22:13:29 2001] Lerdar tells the guild, 'Sure, be polite when you kill them'<br>
^^ROFL - i overheard this and just about bust a gut...<br>
[Thu Mar 01 22:15:34 2001] Solka tells you, 'I want u to kill me like aklas . i mean if he is kos to you then i want to be . he s a good guy doesnt pk . sells to n00b cheap  '<br>
^^oh boy...<br>
[Thu Mar 01 22:21:11 2001] Wyrdrin tells you, 'What is your guild name ?'<br>
[Thu Mar 01 22:21:25 2001] You told Wyrdrin, 'Illuvitae'<br>
^^and so, my descent into hell continues....I think I did more typing than I did anything else tonight..<br>
<br>
Does anyone know about Shield of Honor - are they bindrushing scum buckets, or pretty reasonable most of the time?  Just wondering what I'm up against here.<br>
<br>
Please critique - I am trying to hone my understanding of the rules of the road here - what do we accept?  What is unacceptable?<br>

I'm glad I was able to boost your spirits.  The path that we have taken is not going to be an easy roud to follow.  There will be lots of bumps and growing pains. Givin that fact we need to support one another more so than in a usual guild/family enviroment.  In the time I have been here fighting the good fight I feel we have done a great job in that area.  Lets keep up the great work and keep the faith.  We shall prevail!<br>

They will have no qualms about jumping you at low str/mana on thier CR (The jumping me at low STR/MANA in itself wasn't wrong, and can be a valid tactic to use in normal combat.  It was the fact that he did not LnS to respect that I won the battlefield for the minimum time - 30mins in most cases, and took advantage of that to put me down just to spite me). <p>Dorkmid

He stopped at the first ramp, and turned to see if I really saw him (I guess he thought I was bluffing), and I was right in his face.  He left quickly after that.  Also asked a gnome to leave, and he was chased off as well.  I think the word is starting to get out about the Kelethin bank.  I did not see the brazen attitudes that have been the norm (althought the weekend is coming up - we should probably make it a point to push the issue hard with all the resources we can muster).<br>
<br>
For the most part the bank platform was clear of non-elves, then a call for help went up on guildsay.  Koldeblooded (Iksar Wizard) was PK'ing at the Wizzie Spires.  From the Vallon-Zek message board I learned that this fellow deleveled his 35th avatar down to 12.  Several of our fellow elfs were on him when I got there.  He shadow stepped repeatedly.  I managed to get my pet on him, and blast him a few times.  The last time he disappeared I think he may have gated since I did not see him anymore after that (If anyone can validate this please add your story).  <br>
<br>
While at the spires my pet managed to kill at least 1 human (possibly a 2nd while I was medding - sent my pet in to help other guild members - who took off on a battle deep in the woods).  After that I was called away by friends who were more interested in leveling, and got a bubble of exp in Unrest.<br>
<br>
All in all a pretty eventful night, for being on only a couple of hours.  Keep the faith all. <p>Dorkmid
