She looks around for an empty seat to rest herself after a long day of scouting and patroling the forest hunting down invaders from neighboring lands.  Finding a table Sharda sits with her back toward the wall so no one can sneak up behind her.  <br>
<br>
Glancing around the room to see if anything looks strange she notices some of her brethern entering a room towards the back of the tavern.  Peering back but not looking to obvious she also can see that the door is guarded by two well built Feir'dal. Curious as to what was going on, she steps into the shadows and attempts to sneak past the guards. Quietly she creeps behind the guards, and slips past into the back room.  Staying in the shadows, she watchs as more of her kind enter past the guards by signaling them with some sort of hand signals, a secret hand language perhaps.  A few minutes later the two that were guarding the door enter and shut the door.  <br>
<br>
A male elf stood up and addressed all those in attendance.  By the way he spoke and the way all those gathered were listening so intently to his words, she assumed that he was the leader of this band.  He was a very powerful speaker and his eyes burned with passion for his cause.  He spoke of The Faydarks and the glory that the elves of old once had, and how we needed to take back our sacred lands from the pests and vermin of other lands and races by all means necessary.  Listening to this elf speak the hairs on the back of her neck were standing on end.  She knew this was clearly her calling in life.  Wile he was speaking she noticed the speaker motion to another Elf who was standing close by.  <br>
<br>
Not even an instant went by when Sharda felt someone grab her, and disarm her of her trusty daggers, exposing her hiding place in the room.  All those gathered turned around to look at her. There was horror and hatred on their faces, how dare someone intrude on this meeting.  The elf in the front of the room, looked back at Sharda with a deadly gaze. Sharda was disappointed in herself for letting her guard down by being mesmerized by the leaders words.  Sharda thought to herself, how am i going to get out of this mess.  Beofre she could act. The leader took a step forward and laughed.  He said to her, &quot;My name is Tulweyen the leader of this band of patriots.  The elf behind you is Ceescrit my second in command. This group beofre you is an army of Elven Freedm Fighters.  Under normal circumstances you would be dealt with accordingly and it wouldnt be pleasant i can assure you.  In this case however, one of our own has spoken for you and has told us the tale of how you helped him in battle against a filthy barbarian and a gnome near Clan Crushbones lair.  Even though you were outmatched you gave of yourself freely.  However my young rogue you are not out of the woods yet.  If you wish to join this army you must prove your loyalty to the Elven nation.  I need you to slay 3 invaders and bring back the proof of their deaths to be by sundown.&quot;  At this point Sharda was relieved, after all she was quite find of ridding her peoples forest of outsiders.  She thought this will be an easy task indeed.  Ceescrit escorted her out and gave her back her daggers.  Ceescrit then said to her &quot;Do not let us down, we will see you by nightfall&quot;<br>
<br>
Sharda was a little shaken up by this ordeal, but overall she was thrilled.  She knew that she would fit in with this group because they shared the same ideals and wanted the same thing.  Returning the Elven Nation to Glory!<br>
<br>
Sharda then set out to complete the task that Tulweyen had givin her.  Sneaking through the shadows she ran across two gnome necromancers harassing a young elf warrior.  She could sense the fear in the young elf as these 2 gnomes with undead pets, started to attack him.  Leaping out of the shadows full of rage, Sharda began plunging her daggers into the back of one of the gnomes.  The gnome screamed in agony and tried to run. Sharda being too fast and agile continued to persue the gnome, even though the undead and other gnome were attacking her. With one final blow the gnome fell, with his death, the gnomes pet fell into a clump of dust on the forest floor. The young elf had begin to attack the other gnomes skeleton.  She then turned to the other gnome, he could see the rage within her, and blood that dripped from her daggers and covered her face and tunic.  She saw the fear in the gnomes eyes.  For he knew that his pet was about to die...  <br>
...and so was he.  Before the gnome could flee, she stepped into the shadows and disappeared as far as the remaining gnome could see.  A split second later she was standing behind the gnome and with two thrusts of her daggers the second gnome had fallen.  The young elf she saved was very grateful and offered her bandages to fix her wounds and supplies.  The young elf was about to thank her again but Sharda disappeared before his very eyes.  She followed in the shadows behind the young elf until he made it back to Kelethin safely.  <br>
<br>
It was almost sundown and she had only killed two of the three.  As always Sharda kept to the shadows.  While she was walking she saw a group of people talking near the strange Priest of Discord.  She looked at the Priest who was a human and in the back of her mind said to him. &quot;today is the day you will feel my daggers in your sides.   As she was about to engage the Priest, she overheard the group talking about a Human cleric named Retton who was attacking elves near some ruins on the outskirts of Kelethin.  Hearing this she chuckled and thought to herself, today is your lucky day Priest, you shall fall eventually.  As quickly as she could she headed out to the area of the ruins.  Sure enough when she got the the ruins she saw the human, leaning against one of the pillars looking smug, as humans usually do.  At his feet was the corpse of a druid.  While the druid was dead she had fought valiantly.  While the human was rejoicing in his victory she could tell he was injured.  Standing back becausethere wa s no easy way to sneak up on him. She reached around and grabbed her bow and let loose an arrow that found its mark in the human clerics leg.  The human screamed in pain, but began to chant.  When he was done Sharda felt a shock run through her body, she regained her self and ran at the cleric who was busy chanting some more words unknown to Sharda.  Before the cleric could finish his chant Sharda relaeased a fury of stabs into the cleric.  The cleric tried to chant again but she was too fast and interupted his thought and flow.  The human had givin up hope and began to run, seeing this Sharda reached into her tunic, grabbed throwing dagger and threw it,  It hit the human square in the back.  The cleric then fell to his knees and began to say something.  Sharda wasnt sure what he was saying but it sounded like a prayer, the human never got to finish that prayer.  Sharda wiped off her daggers and placed them back in her tunic.  With this she headed back to the tavern to show Tulweyen the proof of her loyalty.<br>
<br>
Upon entering the tavern she noticed that it was almost empty.  In a corner table sat Tulweyen and Ceescrit.  Sharda approached the table, but before she could speak, Tulweyen said &quot; I assume you bring us good news&quot;  Sharda then dropped a bag on the table, Tulweyen motioned to Ceescrit to open the bag.  Ceescrit opened the bag, and nodded to Tulweyen.  You have done well, and have proven your loyalty to us but most of all the Great Elven Nation.  You are now one of us&quot; Tulweyen stated proudly.  Tulweyen then whisperd to Ceescrit who then placed the mark of Illuvitae on Sharda.  <br>
<br>
the rest is the future.<br>
