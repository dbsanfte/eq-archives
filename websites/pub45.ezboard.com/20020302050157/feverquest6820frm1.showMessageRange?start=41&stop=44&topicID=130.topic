Its that simple. ERG like so many newer upcoming guilds (Mythic Guardian Council, Norrath Elite Council, to name a couple others) practice this philosophy of immortal healing so much that its pointless to even give reasons why its acceptable. Cause its not acceptable. And I think Cinderkitten is doing a very good job of pwning you thus far. If Im playing my twink and I see a group of ERG, with one of them in range and the others out of range, I would &quot;expect&quot; the high levels to be courtious and remain out of the conflict. However, I started the conflict, so I fully &quot;expect&quot; their guild to help the lower level member I am attacking. Unfortunately, most times i ignore the person...<br>
<br>
and thats when shit hits the fan. So and so starts calling me a pussy or a fag for not attacking them 1 on 1. Then said person rushes me, of course I defend myself. And when said person begins losing, we hear &quot;omg guild help me now now!!!&quot; whining &amp; thus the FeF tactics of immortal healing and giant ballz of steel growth begin. I killed Myth and Legends member in Velktors once a few weeks back during the PvP event. Their guild sends me an &quot;Im an asshole u know that right?&quot; tell. Sure, if it makes u feel better to state the obvious, go ahead! Flatter me! I sit down to med, checking the /wh list and suddenly Winterknight (the dorf, not human) attacks me. WOOT....<br>
<br>
or so I thought! Keep in mind HE rushed ME, not vice versa. While I proceed to fight him, a shaman and enchanter he conveniently had with him begin healing dmg and curing any tash I cast on him. Now you might say, &quot;Well Inque, you said you fully expect a guild to defend its members right?&quot; That sir is correct, presuming I started the fight. People scream they want fair combat. Well how fair is my own team healing my opponent, especially if my opponent started the conflict w/ his healers knowing he had no threat of death? Thats not fair to me. But to you, Velox, its ok cause I r uber bad lighty PKr. Anyone have clue x 4's?<br>
<br>
What he did was no better than a level 10 PKing w/ a level 50 cleric or whatnot following around to immortal / buff any dmg done by people within that lvl 10's range. Winterknight struck me knowing he had no threat of losing, then I was given a lecture on how its bad to PK lighties, how Im giving AO a bad rep, and then Im banned from the M&amp;L message board for it.<br>
<br>
(Interesting side note, Vagan was in the area with me, so when Winterknight decided to do this, I called in uber rogue PKr for help. Vagan and I took down Winterknight, and I got called a griefer for having a purist kill the guy)<br>
<br>
So that brings me to my next argument, Velox, if its ok for ERG to defend its &quot;team&quot; regardless of guild or level, w/ immy healing and buffing during PvP against guilds like Combine etc, why is it wrong if I (putting guildtag aside) buffed a &quot;human&quot; team member who chose to go out and PvP. Its ok for ERG to defend the elf team but not me to PK w/ my own human team member? Oh but thats right, Vagan isnt a lighty, he's in Combine, and that makes him really bad right? No, it makes him a blue team vs a elf team. And this person has to deal with blue team healing said elf team because said purist is PvPing and said elf team cant hack it, and said pursists own blue team defends it by saying &quot;he's a lighty, why u hit?&quot;<br>
<br>
Sounds like a jumble, but its 2 am. Ill let Cinderkitten translate for you, Im too tired to go back and rewrite it. Basically though, STFU over immy healing. Its not good no matter how its done, my own guild has members that wont immy heal if Im fighting an elf thats KOS and I have an elf cleric with me, unless there is someone w/ that opponent that can hit my cleric too. Ive yet to see Illuvitae grief anyone, the only thing they do, like me, is PVP on a PVP server. I realize its a hard concept for some people to grasp, but not everyone sucks on the Velktors Lab or Karnors nipples. And maybe when people realize that on a PvP server u are owed nothing cept respect, things might change. Til then I agree 100% with that majority saying ERG is trash, until Im shown screenshots of Illuvitae or Combine griefing - unlike the massive amts of SS's I see of whining baby's from Mythic Guardian Council or whatever the hell Norrath's newbie guilds are that die daily to purist PvP...or any PvP for that matter. /rant off<br>

<br>
so...  in not so many words you are saying that because everyone deserves the right to not be healed against, one should take steps to avoid doing it themselves therefore creating an example and maby -good karma- as it goes around and comes back to you where next time it won't be done to you?<br>
<br>
PS i don't think you can compare this to training. you may consider it similar, but even if it ends up falling into the same category, it is far less of an action. when is the last time you lost exp from a heal? i think everyone agrees that training is griefing as it is a negative action. i think most people that heal do it with a positive intention of saving someone therefore it's viewed as a positive action, and can't be griefing if they are doing a positive action. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub45.ezboard.com/uanubiux.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anubiux</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/10/02 2:44:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/feverquest6820frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=130.topic&index=43>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: most annoying guilds...</span><hr size=1> it's griefing cause they can't hit you to stop your healing.
