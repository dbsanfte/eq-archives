Are you trying to make a point?  I'm assuming by quoting our charter, and then typing that sentence (which I still don't understand), you have some problem with our charter.<br>

Would you like to point out what the problem is?  Or perhaps how the Amazons have a better solution?<br>

The Amazons present, (not past), do not IMH in any situtation.  A elf can not heal a human when an elf is attacking.<br>
<br>
If you are attacking you can not IMH if the defender is green or red to the healer.<br>
<br>
And where we differ is that the defender healer can not heal if the attacker is red or green to them.<br>
<br>
Under no situtation can you IMH.  Members have been removed because of that.  And you guild has a complaint again an Amazon right now for breaking the rule, and if it is found that they did, they will be removed because they knew the rules.<br>
<br>
The bottom line under your present charter you guild can IMH when defending.<br>

Let me know when all this situation occurs and we will deal with it at that time.  <br>
<br>
I can't believe you would make up a scenario and rant and rave about it when it NEVER occured!  There have been plenty of timed where I have been with Ceescrit and I was within 2 levels of him and he told me not to OOR heal him.  He died in a couple of the situations. <br>
<br>
That rule was written in for group PvP.  Many times when attacked by a group, you don't have time to con every person attacking you before you heal your teammate.   Basically, we heal first if the guildmember is within the 8 levels and ask questions later.  If you attack a group of elves with a healer, you better expect them to heal their group.  <br>
<br>
Seriously Bendenw, you have had some ok things to say, but you are starting to just cause trouble here for no reason.  If you have any evidence that you are being griefed by anyone in &lt;Illuvitae&gt;,  let  us know.  If not, don't make up scenarios and expect us to defend something that NEVER happened to you.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A8A8A8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub45.ezboard.com/ueladare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eladare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(4/13/02 12:18:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/feverquest6820frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=267.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> I'm sorry Bendenw, the only thing I've learned so far is that when it comes to Amazons, they're all useless with the exception of Linamarae.<br>

I have a couple of points to raise...<br>
<br>
1) I understand the Illuvitae (sp? sorry im crap at it) view of Immy healing, as a warrior I have never asked for a heal in PvP because I personally would rather fight fair (whatever that means ;-)<br>
<br>
2) I CAN also understand the Illuv. view that a dorf shouldnt heal a human because they are on different teams, however I see the flip side that again due to Illuv. charter technically the dorf (if within the level limit of the elf (<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  see's nothing wrong he/she is hittable. This I think is a grey area because of the lack of other teams in Illuv. (similar to the way FDB work, you know as you dont have any other team in your guild you can never be same race as someone attacking a guildy).<br>
<br>
3) I think that the situation's occur in game and stuff happens. This is what officers are for. Most ppl around my lvl now are (i think) sensible enough to understand grief play. I personally have NEVER had any problem with Illuv. corpse camping/Immy healing etc and think that although u are a bunch of brainwashed skinny treehuggers (/jk ;-)) ) you fight acording to the rules. <br>
<br>
On the reverse when i have been pk'ed by Illuv I have always LnS'ed immediately unless I was xp killed (again xp death appeared accidental so no issue) if xp death occurs I ask the player concerned whether they mind me getting back some lost xp and 90% of the time they are agreeable.<br>
<br>
/roleplay is wonderful (and u guys do it well) but also common sense and empathy for the enemy is required.<br>
<br>
Ive been very long winded in saying that Illuv. kill me regularly and I hate seeing that tag coming towards me but I know I'm in for a good fight. You guys have improved my pvp skills no end ))<br>
<br>
And REALLY finally an impassioned plea, next time you see the dorf with half health sitting at the gfay spires looking nervous Dont kill him heehee <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A8A8A8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub45.ezboard.com/uinquescorpous.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Inque SCorpous</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(4/17/02 11:39:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/feverquest6820frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=267.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Need Clarification</span><hr size=1> Yard Trash &gt; FDB &amp; Amazons<br>

<br>
If you have a complain about a member, bring it to an officer and they will take care of it.  Also our web sit has a complaint area where you can bring it to public notice if you have a problem with a member of the guild.<br>
<br>
www.thefdb.com<br>
<br>
Well we can all talk about what has happened in the past.  Your guild members have has problems with members in the past, and people have had problems with some members of you guild in the past.  <br>
<br>
It is hard to fix those problems.  We have put things into place to resolve confict.  I see your officer offer ways to resolve an thing that might go on with you guild.<br>
<br>
The two guilds have some difference on how the game should be played.  But both look like they want to play it honorably.<br>
<br>
My guildmate gave you guild some complements and all he got back was flame.<br>

Lets hope we can move beyond that.<br>

The offer has been extended from the Amazons and FDB leadership to help resolve any conflicts, and that option has always been offered to everyone from Tulweyen and myself concerning Illuivtae's in game conduct.  I'd like to thank those that took the time and read these threads, sorted through the flames, and tried to input something positive and underrogatory.  We're always open to critisims as a guild and leaders, as long as they are meant to be constructive and not attempt to smear our names.<br>
<br>
On that note, I will take your words to heart reguarding contacting you via message boards with any future issues.  I am telling my guild mates, here and now, to cease and desist with all negative remarks and trash talk.  Whether it be in game, or on the boards, they are always supposed to go through and officer or guild leader with issues from other guilds and the conduct of their members.<br>
