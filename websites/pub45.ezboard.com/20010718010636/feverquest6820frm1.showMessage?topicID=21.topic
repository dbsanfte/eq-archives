^^ I was surprised that he made this statement after his initial attitude - and it really validated my approach in my mind.<br>
<br>
[Thu Feb 15 20:40:22 2001] You told Rozzar, 'We will teach them as best we can - please have patience with us in the begining.'<br>
^^ Here I am being diplomatic.  I do not know Rozzar, or his history.  But, I showed him a little respect and tried to illustrate for him that the guild was moving forward in a positive manner.  The picture our opponents have of our guild is critical to its success IMHO.<br>
<br>

[Thu Feb 15 20:41:22 2001] You told Rozzar, 'off to kill Orcs - hope to see you in battle again one day.'<br>
[Thu Feb 15 20:41:30 2001] Dorkmid bows before Rozzar.<br>
<br>
And off I went...no smack talking and cussing...no 'I'm gonna log my main and kick your ass'.  Just plain, simple curtesy mixed with a tinge of vengence <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .  This IMHO is the way to lose, and if the roles were reversed to also win on Vallon-Zek.<br>

<br>
On a side note, I got a tell tonight from an irate human ranger who had been pk'ed by our guild (no surprise there).  What was surprising was that he explained that he respected what our guild was doing, and that he had no problem with elves KOS'ing him in elven territory, WOW.<br>
<br>
He did, however, have two major compliants:<br>
<br>
1) His attackers set in on him just moments after he shouted looking for a bind, resulting in a very long corpse run from qeynos.<br>
<br>
2) His attackers mocked him in tells afterwards, telling him to &quot;enjoy the walk&quot;.<br>
<br>
On issue number 1, I have mixed feelings.  On one hand, I don't want to allow foreigners to be bound in our home, especially when so many of them bind rush.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I know just how miserable corpse runs can be for melee classes who can't sow, gate, bind, port, or anything else for that matter.  Qeynos to Kelethin's gotta be about the longest corpse run one can make.  Just the thought of crossing the Karanas, hell, just crossing WK is enough to make me wanna leave the corpse to rot.  The situation is worsened by the fact that the player was only in his mid teens, making this a very dangerous journey in full gear, let alone naked.<br>
<br>
In order to alleviate some needless suffering, I suggest that if we begin killing someone who informs us they are bound far away we give them the option to leave the zone peacefully and seek a bind in Kaladim or Ak'anon before returning.  There is no shortage of other infidels to slay, and as long as that particular individual is removed from the zone, our work is complete, in my mind.<br>
<br>
On issue number two, this is just wrong.  I don't think we should ever taunt our foes after vanquishing them, it is simply cruelty, and something that I'm sure our godess Tunare would frown upon.  I try to send a tell to my opponent after any good pvp match, regardless of the outcome, just a simple &quot;good fight&quot; or a comment on a particularly impressive trick they pulled off.  More often than not I will receive an obscene response to such tells when I am the victor or &quot;fight me again, I wasn't at full mana&quot;, but these are dealt with by a simple ignore and at times the response is a nice conversation instead.  At the risk of sounding cliched, if you can't say anything nice... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub45.ezboard.com/uceescritdabossalini.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceescrit da Bossalini</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br> <font color=#660000>(2/16/01 8:01:40 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Good PvP</span><hr size=1> 1) You should have no qualms killing outsiders in our lands looking for a bind.  That's the same as letting a dark elf PK get a bind in our newbie area.  It should be your mission, if anything, to prevent this from happening.  Being bound far away is no excuse for avoiding PvP.  They shouldn't be in our cities anyway.<br>
<br>
2) Taunts and tells afterwards are uncalled for.  I think I recieved a simillar tell from this guy, and I told him to take screen shots of the tells and come post them here.  This will NOT be tolerated in any way shape or form. <p><b>Ceescrit Bossalini</b><BR>

<br>
Hope ye don't mind me butting in :)<br>
<br>
Cees is absolutely correct, in that you should have no qualms about killing a foe who is not yet bound. Allowing them to get bound in your territory is against everything you stand for. Yes, corpse runs across the waters is a major hassle. But thems the breaks. <br>
<br>
Sending taunts after you kill someone, is an absolute no-no, and doubly so in case of a long cr. I've killed people in Highhold and sent them back to Kunark, and although I still feel that &quot;thems the breaks&quot; -- I can sympathize. <br>
<br>
On the subject of duels: I don't do 'em. If I can't hit them, I wont fight them. If they are 9 lvls below, or above me, the fight is pointless. If they are of my own race, I'll just ignore them. If I wanted to fight my own race, I'd be on Rallos. <br>
<br>
Furthermore, I'd not fight a duel, or any other battle, that I was sure I would lose. I'm not saying I only pick fights I know I can win, far from it, I lose all the time. But to commit to a fight that is non more than a ritual suicide, I see no point or value in that. Yes, the player that beats you may send you a message along the lines of &quot;I wish others in your guild were as honorable as you&quot; etc., and you think you have made a good impression on someone -- but the truth is, a graceful winner means nothing. I've seen very trashy players behave like utter gentlemen, when I have fought and lost against them, they've been the very pinacle of sportsmanship, when they win -- no matter how cheap or pointless their victory was. A &quot;Great fight&quot; from a winner is meaningless, and I've gotten quite a few of those. A &quot;great fight&quot; from a loser, now that is a rare treat indeed, and I can only ever remember having gotten one of those. <br>
<br>
As a Shank, I would not attack, let alone challenge an OOR enemy to a duel, merely because they are on my lands. If I do not have a reasonable chance of killing, or running them off, I would follow them, while calling my brothers and sisters to arms. Then, when I judged our chances to be acceptable, I would attack. <br>
<br>
Of course, making a symbolic, pointless attack that is bound to fail, might make a &quot;good&quot; impression on a opposing player, who would cry foul, if you had gotten your brothers and sisters together and fallen upon your foe like a pack of wolves, and destroyed them. <br>
<br>
But that might be your nature, to be gallant and chivalrous, ye high-fallotin' pointy ears :) <br>
<br>
At any rate, I wish you the best, and I'm really happy to see how you've stirred up things. You're doing a great job. <br>

I had a guild leader flame me all last night because of us attacking his members. We did attack but unfortunatly their guild does not enforce LnS. He said that he was going to hunt us down and kill us in not so nice terms. I said &quot;great! That should be your response, we would do the same.&quot; To that he only replied with a few more yeah-well's and it was finished.<br>
<br>
Another thing I do is commend the person who killed me, if it was an honerable fight. If it wasnt, leave it, or leave the comments in guild chat, no one likes a whiner.<br>
<br>
As to binds, its impossible to start asking people if they are bound or not and most would lie anyway just not to be killed.<br>
