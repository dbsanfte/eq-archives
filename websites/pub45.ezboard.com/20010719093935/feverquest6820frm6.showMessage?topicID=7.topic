<br>
&quot;Dorkmid is my given name.  I am of High-Elven blood, and at one time my family were landowners and lords when our lands were on the western continent of Tunaria (Antonica).  Upon the disolution and distruction of our lands, and our eventual flight to Faydwer we fell out of favor with the royal houses.  This was due to my father's half-brother, a Half-Elf named Forian, a rogue who stole from the Royal Family.  My family were, all of us, banished from the city of Felwithe for his mis-deeds.  My father and mother lived out a humble existence in Kelethin as merchants, but died on trading expedition to Qeynos under mysterious circumstances.<br>
<br>
I have vowed to bring my family name from the ashes back to the light of day, and to avenge the death of my family.  I have made favorable contacts with members of the royal family and have just recently regained access to the city of my birth (Felwithe).  As a faithful follower of Mithaniel Marr, I will continue the battle to rid our lands of the evil menace that has grown here like a malignant virus.&quot;<br>

Being a woodelf, I grew up in Kelethin, and entered the world of Norrath in the Faydarks.<br>
<br>
However, I soon realized the that the Elven life as I knew it did not suit me.  My brethren lacked backbone.  Those that weren't crying to the whole forest, were off in the rest of the world, slaying mindless monsters for their token loot.<br>
<br>
I left the Faydarks, and joined up with a clan of rogues.  Ironically, here amongst thieving backstabbing multi-racial rogues, I found family.  Many friendships were formed, and I spent much time with these friends, honing my skills in combat.  Unlike my brothers and sisters of old who left Kelethin for the planes and other places, I remained at my level.  Harassing the evil ones, and duelling for money, I gained much in skill and wealth.<br>
<br>
But I was still empty...  I could not deny my elven heritage, no matter how much I tried.  And so I returned to the Faydarks.  I brought with me, one of my rogueish comrades, Ceescrit Bossalini.<br>
<br>
Sickened by what had happened to our race, we vowed to change what we could.  We banded together with a few other brave elven souls, attempting to restore the honor, the pride, and the backbone of the Elven race.  Thus Illuvitae was born...<br>
<br>
Tulweyen still harbors resentment against his race... Most of his brethren would more readily aid the foreigners in his land, than lend a helping hand to him and his noble guild.  But this only fuels his desire to bring about change...  Tulweyen works now to reverse the years of damage done to the Elven race, and to restore them to their once famed glory...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Okay, so that was more of a real history than roleplay... I don't roleplay too well...  But there ya have it.<br>

I started my life as a ranger aspireing to protect the forest.  Early on I discovered my job was cut out for me.  It seems that the evil arts of the Prince of Hate, the Faceless, and the PlagueBringer have corrupted those that our people call allies.  This necromancy has sought to destroy the forest I protect.  To combat this invadeing blight to our homeland, I joined a good group of our people called the Silent Wrath.  We hid and struck at our enemy fast and hard just to disappear as quick as we came.<br>
Then came the dreadful day when the green names came to clease.  Many guilds were disbanded by them never to me seen again. <br>
Distraught I sought a new profession to let my past go till again I found a group of elfs ready to take up the cause.  I became a bard and started to sing to spread cheer since I alone could protect our blind bretheren from the evil that was right before their eyes.  I visited the steamfont mountains in an attempt to stop young necromancers of the vile PlagueBringer.  During this time I did what little I could to fend of the evil to no avail.<br>
Recently a new upraising of valiant elven defenders heard the call of our mother Tunare.  I sought the leader of this fine group to seek what I could do to help this new army.  He told me that Illuvitae needed more Soldiers of Tunare and that Tunare only accepts those who have proven their worth into her army.  I put down my instruments to once again protect the forest, this time as a Soldier of Tunare.  I am here to dedicate my life to her cause. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub45.ezboard.com/uceescritdabossalini.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceescrit da Bossalini</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Commander in Chief</span><br> <font color=#660000>(2/27/01 1:30:57 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> A Tale of Two Thugs</span><hr size=1> &lt;i&gt;A tall slim figure emerges from the shadows, from a dark corner at the back of the tavern.  Looking down at his two deadly knifes, one in each hand, both stained with the blood of all his fallen victims, he gracefully tucks them in his troll-hide belt, then pulls out a purse heavy with ill-gotten coin and smuggled goods and drops it on the table in front of him.  He then grabs a chair, turns it around backwards and slumps down onto it, propping his arms across the backrest.  After uncorking his freshly stolen bottle of Elven wine, and taking a few gulps, he begins his tale...&lt;/i&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;I once new nothing of this forest, or what powers were possessed within its vastness, or the great mother of earth.  All I new was the life of crime and murderers.  There were no gods, no all knowing powers, no racial ties, nothing but my band of thugs and thieves.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Never knowing my mother, a beautiful wood elf of Tunare, bard by profession, this forest never was of significance to me.  The money and glory was all that of Antonica, the lost world of Kunark, and beyond.  Rumor has it, that I was conceived in a shack among the Woodelf outpost in Lfay, on one of my father's smuggling rendezvous to Kelethin.  After hearing my mother's beautiful voice bellowing through this very bar, he new that he must father her child.  Religion and a conscience he cared not of though, being an agonistic Human rogue.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shortly after I had been born, and was able to stand on my own two feet, my mother made arrangements for me to be sent to live with my father, to be raised as a man, that could survive in today's war-ridden world.  He taught me the ways of the rogues, master thievery, deadly combat, and to be a skilled alchemist, master of the worlds most venomous poisons.  Then, at a young age of 16 years, he abandoned me, to set out on yet another one of his murderous money-making crusades, never to be seen or heard from again.&quot;<br>
<br>
It was about this time, that I started running with a band of thugs, known as the Order of the Black Rose.  Racial and religious boundaries they were blind to, shunned by society they cared not, they were in it for the benifits.  It was hear that I found comradery, trained under the most infamous of rogues, thieves and assassins in Norrath, and really honed the skills of my profession.  We were all loners, yet felt a sense of brotherhood when we actually went out on rare excursions for profit and skill.  Murdering anyone that stepped in our way, and robbing the rest that never saw us come or go.  This was my life, and until it happened, this was all I new of the world.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then the day, the turning point of my life...  I received a telegram from the Faydwer bards that my one and only mother, the blood of my cursed pointy ears, had been murdered by a pack of evil gnomes in her very own Forest.  At about this same time, one of my OBR compares of pure elven heritage had been tossing around the idea of an Elven uprising, a rebellion against the free trade and what had become the foreign quarters of the Greater Fay.  I was all for it.  So I said my goodbyes to my fellow thieves, packet up all my loot and goods, and headed out with Tulweyen Venemous to set up shop in Kelethin, city in the trees.  After these two events, everything seemed to start falling in place.<br>
<br>
Now as the commander in chief of the Elven rebellion, I am able to satisfy roguish needs or blood lust, thievery, while fighting for a cause that now had meaning in my life.  Its is now my mission to avenge my mothers ill-fated death, by cleansing the once safe Faydarks and it's cities of all the inferior and evil races.  Nothing shall stand in my path, no one will be granted mercy on my turf, on my mother's grave. <p><b>Ceescrit Bossalini</b><BR>
