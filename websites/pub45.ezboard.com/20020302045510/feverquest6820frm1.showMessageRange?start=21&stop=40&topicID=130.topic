I think you'd be comfortable knowing that while Takish utterly obliterates your guild, we are totally annihilating EAG.  So how about it?  Sound like a plan?<br>
<br>
This &quot;guildwar&quot; between Illuvitae and ERG happened WAY before my time.  And based on how lousy in pvp the EAG members are that i've run across, we'll allow you a ten day period to train them on how to press the &quot;a&quot; button.  <br>

<br>
seriously though some of these posts here are pretty funny.<br>
<br>
&quot;I used to kill Veloxupus! EAT ELF BETTER THAN CHICKEN!&quot;<br>
<br>
i don't remember you ever killing me, and when you fought my bard you went and hid in the giant fort.<br>
<br>
&quot;You might as well go 4 teams if your ERG. What's the difference and your reasons to leave the 4th team out of your alliance? I can't grasp your logic. Who told you that darks were worse to your people than humans? What makes and Iksar worse than a gnome? WHy do you shun the DE's, yet immortally heal for Vah Shir against your own kindred?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You might as well group with the darks. What's the difference between them and the dwarves you play with? Did you mommy tell you the darks were bad when you were a kid or something? I don't get it.&quot;<br>
<br>
it has nothing to do with anyone telling us anything. its just the way the server evolved. when vallon opened there were probably more darks than the other 3 teams combined. freeport was basically a darky city. grey companions came to faydwer and found us, ERG. they proposed an alliance and ERG knew that the darks would go on to dominate everyone if they were left unchecked so we agred to the alliance. we then got FDB to join the alliance a short time later by forming a blockade at kaladim and demanding to talk with their leaders. (at the time these were probably the 3 guilds best able to represent their team. possibly the largest for their respective teams.) the light alliance then sailed back to antoncia and drove the darks out of freeport. eventually the power of darks faded leaving the light alliance far stronger than them, but we (and obviously many others) grew to be friends with our war allies and saw no reason to abandon the alliance and go back to killing the the 2 other light teams. no need to stab our new friends in the backs. thats why we are allied with blue and purple.<br>
<br>
now, darks were THE reason the alliance was formed so why would we go frolic with them? also, the 12 prophets and later prophets were THE example of what 4 teaming was all about. they freely used dirty tactics like mob training etc and so (this is my theory) 4 team guilds became branded as the enemy and as a dirty playing one at that. perhaps it would have changed but subsiquent guilds seemed to follow by example. and if that gnome or whatever is in a known hostile guild or has attacked me in the past i will kos them. i usually guildstatus everyone i see.<br>
<br>
eventually the server became highly complacent and light vs dark sort of became a given, and now people like you come to the server and wonder why teams don't fight like the name says. you came here to pvp so you join a purist pk vs all guild and then go and acuse the ones that have been here forever of following what mommy told us to do. the only guild on vallon older than ERG is FDB, our counterpart in the alliance. grey companions faded away unfortunately due to dissention among the leadership. i always laugh when i see people in your purist guilds that flame the light alliance constantly and go on about pure teaming and then level up and join one of the zerg x-team guilds. in time i bet i see 90% of you in one of the various ubber guilds. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub45.ezboard.com/uanubiux.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anubiux</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/1/02 6:57:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/feverquest6820frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=130.topic&index=25>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: !</span><hr size=1> &quot;i don't remember you ever killing me, and when you fought my bard you went and hid in the giant fort.&quot;<br>

I think the lower levels got treated pretty rough by ERG. That is what it meant to be Elf only to me.. We took the hardest path in the game.. Most people are happy holding hands and collecting loot.. When I came to Vallon I could never dream a more miserable place than it is.. I am glad there are a few players left who share the vision as I saw it.. <br>

You still make no sense.  If you wanted to live in safety without being attacked by the overpowering darkies, why not form an alliance with them?  If you're so &quot;old school&quot; and have been around so much longer than all the purists, why didn't you evolve the server into 4 teams?  It's all because you're a coward, who strives for safety in numbers and you will only Pvp when your prepared.  You are the type of player who whines all the time about beind attacked by another race when you're not ready.  <br>
<br>
It's easy to Pvp against darks when their not ready and you are on a group killing spree.  It's not easy when you fight people where you level.  That's the difference between taking the easy way out and fighting your way up through levels.<br>
<br>
I liken purism to paying your own way through college.  It's a much tougher road, but a much more satisfying one as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A8A8A8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub45.ezboard.com/umienae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mienae</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Angry Elf</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/6/02 11:49:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/feverquest6820frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=130.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: most annoying guilds...</span><hr size=1> Guildwar Takish, I guarantee you won't be the ones worrying about faction loss :P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub45.ezboard.com/uveloxlupus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VeloxLupus</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.veloxlupuspics.homestead.com/files/icon.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/6/02 2:40:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/feverquest6820frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=130.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://veloxlupuspics.homestead.com/files/druid2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: most annoying guilds...</span><hr size=1> ok, since you are asking, i'll answer.<br>
<br>
&quot; You still make no sense. If you wanted to live in safety without being attacked by the overpowering darkies, why not form an alliance with them?&quot;<br>
<br>
that obviously wasn't an option. why would they even consider it? with their numbers, i'm sure they saw no reason to want an alliance with anyone. the alliance was formed out of nesecity of evening the odds, and it wasn't about living in safety. it was about living with a fighting chance. hitler could have ruled the world by knocking off countries 1 by 1 if each country said &quot;bah, his empire doesn't boarder my land so i don't need to worry.&quot; he commanded a strong force and i will liken his allies to the way the dark elves manipulate the ogres and trolls. -evil allies? no, friends for now until you outlive your usefulness- many countries unitd as allies to defeat the threat yet afterwards remain good friends. even so there are still radicals in the world that dislike all the lovy dovy junk.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you're so &quot;old school&quot; and have been around so much longer than all the purists, why didn't you evolve the server into 4 teams?&quot;<br>
<br>
sorry this makes no sense. i've already said why the server became 3 team, and what does old school have to do with 4 teams? its like saying -if you're 52, why didn't you grow up in south dakota?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's all because you're a coward, who strives for safety in numbers and you will only Pvp when your prepared. You are the type of player who whines all the time about beind attacked by another race when you're not ready.&quot;<br>
<br>
am i? when's the last time you attacked me? how often do i run around in a group to PvP? let me tell you, prety much never. occasionally i'll get a partner and go PvP, but mostly i fight alone. i've attacked upwards of 12 darkies at once before in skyshrine. obviously yes i was prepared, but it would be asinine of me to not be. and yes i died (via a spam of harm touch) but not without taking down a few of them with me. the image i placed in the other thread was put there for amusement purposes, but it can be used in my defense here. at the end of the fight i lost halfling faction so i was obviously in rivervale. i wasn't prepared for anything, i had just used the bank and walked out to see mystictempest casting on me. he had the upper hand but i recovered and killed him anyway. i always find it is the pker types that whine the most when killed. i don't know what this guy was talking about though /boggle.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's easy to Pvp against darks when their not ready and you are on a group killing spree.&quot;<br>

If anyone should be compared to Hitler, it's the three teamers.  You and your pals who run around immortal healing and griefing the people who are fighting the fair fight.<br>
<br>
Here is an accusation based on fact.  Mystictempest sucks, so any fight that you won with him cannot be entered as a testament to your superiority.  Basically, with your examples, you proved my point.  You fight darkies when you decide to go find them.  You level where it is safe and free from pvp.  You're a three teamer because it's much easier to get loot and higher in levels that way.  Well.....aside from the one day that you got silly crazy wild and attacked the 12 darkies.   <br>

Let me try to explain this to you so you can understand.  The server evolves the way people play it.  If more people weren't cowards in the beginning, the server would be four team.  Although human nature is to take the easy way out.  Unfortunately, people want to bring real life into this game.  Everyone wants to talk about good vs evil, but that's not the way the game was intended to be. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub45.ezboard.com/uveloxlupus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VeloxLupus</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.veloxlupuspics.homestead.com/files/icon.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/7/02 5:06:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/feverquest6820frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=130.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://veloxlupuspics.homestead.com/files/druid2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: most annoying guilds...</span><hr size=1> bah heh yes if this were a spelling bee i'd get trashed. hmm it sems possible we could have gone 4 team as a server because 12 prophets existed... <br>
<br>
you are doing it once again...<br>
&quot;You fight darkies when you decide to go find them.&quot;<br>
no, i <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>attack</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> darkies when i decide to go find them. if they attack me... so be it. i fight them anyway.<br>
<br>
&quot;You level where it is safe and free from pvp.&quot;<br>
well on the rare occasions that i feel like leveling, i usually go to CS to solo. more recently CS has become more of a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> lighty</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> zone but when i started leveling here it was basically always darks and some prophets. mostly i would hunt them when i saw them on the who list, but don't think that they just let me be there. skyshrine and CS were heavy darky leveling grounds for quite some time, yet i was there because i liked it there. if i didn't have enough mobs to kill, i'd just kill the darkies then have plenty.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're a three teamer because it's much easier to get loot and higher in levels that way. Well.....aside from the one day that you got silly crazy wild and attacked the 12 darkies.&quot;<br>
<br>
actually i do stuff like this all the time because its fun. the other day i was sitting at bb rings and a group of macabre ports in and they sit down right as they get there. /shrug veloxlupus begins casting ae spell. most of them ran away right off the bat and their druid stayed to face me. i could have had the battle but i screwed up hardcore. he resisted WD (!@#$%) and then i forgot to click off my first buff as he was casting his dot so i had WD on me and couldn't anul it. i ran off to the side to heal, but by the time i was healed back up a bit the rest of his group had come back and they gang banged me. naturally i start getting tells about how much i suck because i lost to 6 people /shrug.<br>
<br>
ok and how easy is it to get loot for me? basically all the loot i have is from camping it myself or with the help of ERG. i'm 2 kills away from my epic and its all been done with the help of my ERG friends so far. VSR yes... i needed a jade reaver so i led a raid on CoM with the guild and when the reaver dropped everyone insisted i take it without a roll. i know we can take ulump, just waiting for the right people to be on at the same time... we can't kill faydedar, but i'll figure it out when i get there. if all i wanted was loot i would be in defiant. personally, i like doing quests and being in a guild with friendly people.<br>
<br>
mienae, i missed your post, but i don't think anyone besides luin wants to guildwar takish. feel free to ask me to a duel. i can't make any promises that i'll win this time except that i've learned a few more tricks. and although there is prob not going to be a guildwar, we'd be happy to do a friendly arena battle.

<br>
I find it hard to believe that a group of Macabre that killed you 6 on one would start sending you tells about how much you suck unless you started your bs like you have on these boards.  I know Beholdr doesnt condone that sort of thing.<br>
<br>
By the way, being a druid makes you self sufficient.  It is hardly like being a cleric or warrior, so you don't really fall under the category of others in your guild who group for loot.  Hell, I have a 51 druid, who has never grouped with any other races and rarely ever grouped with elves.  Druids are different.  <br>
<br>
You seem to overlook the fact that you group with a guild who is renowned for their immortal healing and grief play and you don't seem to want to address that.  Apparently, it's okay for you  to have fun in your friendly guild, but if someone doesn't play the way you like, you make their gaming experience dissapointing.  My guild plays with a respect and fair game play for everyone.  It's unfortunate that we can't get the same play in return.  That's all this guild is looking for. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A8A8A8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub45.ezboard.com/uveloxlupus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VeloxLupus</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.veloxlupuspics.homestead.com/files/icon.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/8/02 11:01:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/feverquest6820frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=130.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://veloxlupuspics.homestead.com/files/druid2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: most annoying guilds...</span><hr size=1> true. druids are pretty good like that. this is my normal gear set up. i copied it from my char profile on casters realm.<br>

well, let me ask why you consider immy/oor healing griefing? if i'm sitting with my friend somewhere and you come up and look at us. hmm you want to attack him but i'm there. i'm obviously a druid and red con... so why would you even attack this person? even if i don't end up healing the person because i had just given him every buff i have in my spell book before you got there, you would complain of immy buffing. if you don't want to be healed against, don't attack someone with a healer attached to them. sure, it would make your lives easier if you didn't have to deal with any oor healers, but it wold also make the people's lives easier that you are hunting if you didn't hunt them while they were trying to exp.... but theres a big problem (quoting someone in ERG on this. he prob won't see this anyway) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> This isn't burger king zek, you don't get it your way.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> so for all the exp whores that don't want you to bother them while they exp, thats too bad for them because you are going to do it anyway; and then there will be people who were in their place before and know how annoying it is to be ganked right after a fight, and they will sympathize with them and help. you don't want them to help the ones you are trying to kill, but they probably don't care. you can't immediately do anything about it so you call them names like &quot;fefs&quot; and go around preeching to everyone about how bad it is to add the extra degree of dificulty.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> However</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, someone else in ERG has recently persuaded me to think that healing the noobs is in fact a bad thing. it is amazing how many high level people there are now that just plain suck at pvp. the VZ veterans (via twinks) literally make life hell for these people trying to make a mark on the server. if they can make it through the gauntlet on their own, it will be better for them in the long run and maby we won't have so many people who /gate the second someone attacks them. i can only speak for myself on the issue as many others are more empathetic.<br>
<br>
1 thing though even though this doesn't necisarily apply to you. if i were a cleric and my group is attacked by another group, let me tell you. the first thing on my mind would be keeping my group alive and if you think for 1 second that i'm going to start going around and conning all the attackers to see if i can legally heal you have another thing comming. as a druid, i also can be highly offensive in pvp. so i would be more prone to considering the attackers, but i might become healer before that happens if they come with a forcefull first strike. if they are good enough to group with, they are good enough to heal; and if i'm preparing to raid something and you come attack me, your goal to inconvienence me so the last thing on my mind is what you want. and please let me restate. this isn't burger king zek, you don't get it your way. you want to kill the 3 members of my guild you can hit that i need there to do something? too f'ing bad. go find someone else to kill that isn't attached to me.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub45.ezboard.com/uceescritdabossalini.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceescrit da Bossalini</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Da Boss</span><br>  Posts: 333<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/8/02 11:42:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/feverquest6820frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=130.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: most annoying guilds...</span><hr size=1> There's nothing wrong with healing your group (ON YOUR OWN TEAM) members, as long as at least on attacker is in your range.

<br>
First of all, you posted about Mystictempest being a &quot;fag&quot; to you and you killing him.  Since ERG immy heals against us at every opportunity, should Mystictempest deserve some kind of award from us for this?  After all, YOU are the ones out to grief us (note: if you replay &quot;I am not out to grief anyone&quot;, then to make your statement true you have to cease and desist all immy healing against us.  If you don't, you are making what philosophers call a &quot;circularity error&quot;, meaning your argument is invalid because of the blantant false conclusion (I am not out to grief) coupled with a true premise (I immy heal against you)).<br>
<br>
Second of all, immortal healing or buffing DURING a fight is just a sign you are ghey.  Period.  This isn't open to any debate, it's as much fact as the law of gravity.  If you try to justify immy healing, you are extremely ghey.  That being said, buffing someone before a fight is not an argument.  Who cares?  As long as you dont buff DURING, its fair.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, I am apalled that elves like you have no team loyalty.  You have the potential for a great alliance right before you, yet you ruin it.  /shrug.<br>
<br>
Also, I don't think anyone from ERG/EAG has the right to say that many people on Vallon are not good in pvp.  From all my pvp encounters, ERG fall to opponents that I have bested with ease.  I am willing to bet you 500 platinum that your best guildmate squaring off against me in the arena will lose hands down.  If you wish to test this, send me a /tell in game and find one of your members ~ level 30 to battle me (I don't care what class; also, dont be ridiculous and equip him/her with blue diamond gear or ill charm a pet and win that way.  Keep it a battle based on skill).<br>
<br>
So in retrospect, yes, you have made your point, unfounded as it is, and we have all heard it.  Keep on immy healing and trying to justify it, and we'll keep on thinking you are ghey.<br>
<br>
Would you like fries with that?  Thanks, and come again to Burger King Zek.<br>

ok... &quot;After all, YOU are the ones out to grief us (note: if you replay &quot;I am not out to grief anyone&quot;, then to make your statement true you have to cease and desist all immy healing against us.

if you don't consider immy healing greifing, then it simply breaks the chain... only problem from your point of view is:<br>

<br>
therefore an opinion that benefits you becomes fact. you sound like people that debate religion with me. -i know god exists and even though i have no evidence what-so-ever, there is nothing you can say to change my mind because i KNOW he exists.- by that rite, if i were to tell you that: you are only allowed to pk me when i am ready and willing to participate, otherwise you are griefing me. this is not open to debate. pking while the other person isn't ready is griefing bottom line!<br>

Simply put, Postivists believe that the nature of language is a better way to study philosophy, and strive for the elimination of various forms of metaphysics.  Positivists strive to eliminate unanswerable questions such as &quot;Does God exist&quot;?  What proof do you have (or don't have) that God exists?  Philosophy is wasting it's time trying to answer this question because there is no solid evidence, or so the Positivists believe.<br>
<br>
That being said, let's look at your quote here:<br>
<br>
&quot;If you don't consider immy healing griefing, then it breaks the chain&quot;-Veloxlupus<br>
<br>
This is your observation based on opinion.  You don't believe immy healing IS griefing, and that's fine.  I can also believe the world is flat, and that, too, is fine.  Philosophy will not touch what you believe, but can point out the facts and confront you with the evidence of why certain things are wrong or right.<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at your argument and see why it is flawed.  Your premises are :<br>
<br>
1.  Immortal healing is allowed by the game mechanics of Vallon Zek.<br>
2.  I don't believe Immortal healing is wrong.<br>
3.  Many lighties don't believe Immortal healing is wrong.<br>
4.  The majority of the server doesn't believe Immortal healing is wrong.<br>
___________<br>
There is nothing wrong with Immortal Healing<br>
<br>
Your dealing with Immy healing is &quot;a posteriori&quot;, as is ours.  We know immortal healing to be a part of Vallon Zek and actually practiced by many people.  The flaw in your argument here is that it is not &quot;deductively valid&quot;; immortal healing, despite it being allowed by game mechanics, is not accepted entirely by Vallon's population because it is wrong (just like training mobs on others is wrong).  An argument is deductively valid if and only if it's not possible for the premises to all be true and the conclusion false.  What makes your conclusion false?  It's appeal to Utility.<br>
<br>
Utility you may have run across in many of your beginning philosophy classes (a part of Utilitarianism).  Quite simply, it's that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.  If many believe that immy healing is right, the small minority must be wrong.  The error of Utility here is that it doesn't take into account the RIGHTS of the minority.  From a philosophical standpoint, that is unacceptable.<br>
<br>
Let's revise your argument in modus ponus form:<br>
<br>
If P then Q<br>
P<br>
_____<br>
Q<br>
<br>
1.  If Immortal Healing is allowed by the game mechanics of Vallon Zek, then I, many lighties, and the majority of the server don't believe that Immy healing is wrong.<br>
2.  Immortal Healing is allowed by the game mechanics of Vallon Zek.<br>
_________________<br>
Immortal healing isn't wrong.<br>
<br>
The problem?  The argument isn't deductively valid (which it must be in order to be true).  The conclusion cannot be right.  How so?  as mentioned, its appeal to utility for one thing (slavery was allowed by the USA long ago, and accepted by the majority.  It was wrong regardless of how many believed it to be right.  If that example you think to be too harsh, substitute the rules of chess; it's physically possible to move the queen illegally to capture the king, but acceptable?  Not hardly).  And that brings up our second point:  it's appeal to gameplay.<br>
<br>
If immy healing is acceptable, why are the guilds and people that practice it considered by almost EVERYONE to be bad guilds?  While ERG may be a nonono pvp guild, why is it considered trash by almost all of the major 3 team guilds?  If you frequent the major boards of Vallon Zek, you know that ERG is considered to be one of the worst guilds on the server as far as reputation goes.  Illuvitae, on the other hand, is considered fairly honorable for &quot;a bunch of bank ganking purists&quot;...why is this?  Perhaps our policy on fair game play as opposed to ERG's?  Or perhaps our refusal to engage in Immy healing and other trash play? <br>
<br>
Now onto another quote:<br>
&quot; you are only allowed to pk me when i am ready and willing to participate, otherwise you are griefing me. this is not open to debate. pking while the other person isn't ready is griefing bottom line!&quot;-Veloxlupus<br>
<br>
You used this one in an attempt to show me why Immy healing is justified.  Here is where it fails:  When you signed up to play on Vallon, what did the login screen say?  I believe it was the following, correct me if I am in error:<br>
<br>
Vallon Zek (PvP teams)<br>
<br>
Teams here are those flying your color on the server, the unhittable ones.  I can devise an argument from this knowledge expressed like this:<br>
<br>
1.  Vallon Zek is a pvp teams server<br>
2.  Your team is anyone that you can't hit in pvp within 8 levels of you.<br>
3.  Those who arent on your team will try to pk you.<br>
____<br>
I shouldn't go against my team members.<br>
<br>
Due to a flawed game mechanic, this conclusion is not true and open to debate; however, you get the jist of it.  I set that flawed argument up to show you the flaw in yours (ie, you can debate this argument the same way I debate yours as it's based on opinion; unfortunately, the argument that immy healing is wrong is NOT based on opinion):<br>
<br>
1.  You are only allowed to pk me if I am ready and willing to participate, otherwise you are griefing me.<br>
     No!  Again, you knew the risks on playing Vallon Zek.  I am allowed to pk you anytime I wish.  There is no appeal to Utility here, unlike immy healing.  Its opinion, wrong or right.<br>
<br>
2.  This is not open to debate.<br>
     Unfortunately, opinions are ALWAYS open to debate.  Immy healing being wrong, however, isn't because it's appeal to both (1) Utility and (2) bad gameplay.  If you need a refresher, just scroll up and re-read.  If you attempt to justify it, again, you are making a &quot;circularity error&quot;, as it cannot be justified.<br>
<br>
_______________<br>
<br>
pking while the other person isn't ready is griefing bottom line!<br>
     False conclusion here making the argument invalid, as can be shown with the &quot;Vallon Zek is a pvp teams server&quot; argument as well as the &quot;Immy healing is not wrong&quot; argument.<br>
<br>
So in retrospect, Immy healing is just plain wrong.  There is no appeal to the justifications of immy healing, just as there is no appeal to an illegal move in chess.  Got it?<br>
<br>
PS: &quot;Ghey&quot; was used mockingly.   <br>

all i was able to draw from the last post was that immy healing is wrong because the majority of the people on the server have decided against it. therefore you are saying that if the majority agrees on something it becomes fact. -7 out of 10 ogres prefer elven veal over gnome kabobs, therefore the elven veal is better!-<br>
<br>
i think alot of the fact that that the ubber guilds think negatively of immy healing is because most of them probably have twinks hey use to blow off steam and as they tare through the noobs eventually they find someone who will defend them. the person will get all pissed off the healer ruined his fun sh he will whine about it in public channels till he can't breathe, then log on his main and bitch about immy healers in general to his guild and cause a certain opinion to flow about from the crap he whines about.<br>

people love to try to make others agree with their point of view if they think its right, yet the ones pulling all the strings (that decided what would be right) made the rules in their favor and got everyone to buy into their rules, and everyone goes along with it because they think it will make everyone like them more. &quot;omg make me ubber i'm honorable and stuff!&quot; <br>

And once again you are talking but not LISTENING.  Go back and re-read what I wrote (as I read what you did), because you are missing the point entirely.  Here is the bottom line:<br>
<br>
1.  Immy healing is unjustified and wrong.  This is not an opinion.  If you think it is, then you need to go to my above post and read the philosophy behind why it is wrong.  This is a flawed game mechanic and anyone who does it is an exploiter.  Sorry if you disagree, but you are in the wrong.  If I could hit you, then it wouldnt be unfair.  I cant hit you, so it is.<br>
It has nothing to do with what uber guild decides what.  Its just that many people realize how ghey it is, and if you are gonna end up in an uber guild, then you'd better start adhering to the rules of good game play (or try to at least).<br>
<br>
If you attempt to justify immy healing, then logically we should be able to justify training you to stop the immy healing.  Since that is bad game play as well, we don't do it.  <br>
<br>
Now, you come to our message boards and try to argue FOR immortal healing, yet you come here and say, &quot;well, I realize we immy heal against you, but will you defeat our common enemy Mystictempest&quot;?  I don't understand that, sorry.  <br>
<br>
Also what I don't understand is why your guild just isnt a team player.  I dont care whether or not you group with humans/pecks/DE's, but they are not your TEAM.  Many of them will pk you, so why do you heal them when we attack?  Why not just sit the fight out when you know immy healing is wrong?<br>
<br>
/boggle<br>
<br>
I'm sorry you feel that Immy healing is right (it isnt), but as the old saying goes &quot;you can lead a horse to water...&quot;  In any case the best way to illustrate this is to show you.  Make an elven purist twink and level him up to 20 or so.  Then come back and tell me what you think of immy healing.<br>
<br>
Methinks your tune will change REALLY fast. =)    <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/feverquest6820frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=130.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/feverquest6820frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=130.topic&start=41&stop=44>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub45.ezboard.com/feverquest6820frm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=130.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub45.ezboard.com/feverquest6820frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=130.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/feverquest6820frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=130.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.aztecmfgcorp.com/_private/eq/illuvitae/pics/replybutton.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/feverquest6820frm1.emailToFriend?topicID=130.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/feverquest6820frm1.threadControl?topicID=130.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/feverquest6820frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=130.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/feverquest6820frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=130.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub45.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="everquest6820frm1">General<option value="everquest6820frm2">Announcements<option value="everquest6820frm5">The Fence<option value="everquest6820frm6">Heartwood Tavern<option value="everquest6820frm7">Members Only<option value="everquest6820frm9">ELF Raids</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/beverquest6820>Illuvitae-VZ</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/feverquest6820frm1>General</a> <font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href="http://www.illuvitae.com"><Illuvitae></a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright 1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
