My main has been killing him for weeks due to his immortal healing.  He's blue to 37, but continues to claim that he's green.  At 37 it is entirely impossible to hit anyone who is green, and I've even been unable to hit some blues.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, Vlak is the RL brother of Kagnos, everyone's favorite immortal healing paladin.  They also play a pair of human twinks, around level ten, by the names of Saanta and Klawwz (rogue and monk respectively).  Any attempts to kill one of the twinks results in the other camping and logging on their 30 something main to immortal heal.  If anyone has a character that can hit a lvl 39 high elven paladin, I encourage you strongly to kill Kagnos. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub45.ezboard.com/uialieni.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ialieni</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#660000>(2/15/01 9:00:44 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some Choice Log Cut and Pastes...</span><hr size=1> lol Tul, mind if i use the Aspen quote on the Vault boards =) That was too funny. <p>- Ialieni D'Velve</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub45.ezboard.com/utulweyen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tulweyen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#660000>(2/15/01 10:44:09 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Quotes</span><hr size=1> If you can do it tastefully without starting a huge trash thread...<br>

I'm disgusted by my own inability to simply ignore these idiots.  They enjoy getting under my skin, and I let them.  My main KOS's Vlak whenever I see him, and lately I've taken to KOS'ing the entire guild for their refusal to deal with these two losers.  This may very well result in my having to leave my first and only guild because they have a bluebie &quot;we don't kill other lighties even if they're scum&quot; policy and are terrified that they might become KOS to the rampaging hordes of Norrath's Wolfpack.<br>

Run to your body.  Loot your body.  Run away.<br>

Nothing in between...<br>
<br>
Now, I've never played a caster, so I guess you guys gotta med and stuff.  If so, do it at your bind spot, and THEN go get your body.  Or, med up after you've looted and scooted.  Unless of course your bind spot is right at your body.  In which case just loot, and get outta there...<br>
<br>
However, if someone comes across a naked person yelling CR, they have every right to kill them.  Kinda sucks for that person if it is a genuine CR, but it's been abused too much.<br>
