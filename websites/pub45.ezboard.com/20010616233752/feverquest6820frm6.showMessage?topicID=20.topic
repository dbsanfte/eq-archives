We will also be scouting out the area, and hope to find our enemy's haunts.<br>
<br>
The trip over was an event in itself.  I went LD, and was not able to re-log for 15 minutes (damn gems game - I'll never play it again while medding).  When I was finally able to get logged, the group composed of Sazarius, Bartakus, Seqouya and Zantana were already waiting on the docs of Kaladim.  I had to run without sow to make it - and I did with a few minutes to spare.  I was oom and had no supplies (when I went LD I lost all the food, water, bandages etc. that I had conjured) - and so I remained throughout the trip.<br>
<br>
We landed in Freeport, and moved quickly to get out of the city since we were not sure if we were KOS yet to the guards or not...I don't think we were, but we took no chances, and raced out into the east commons.  We zoned into West commons and found what at first I thought was a DE, but turned out to be a wood elf bard wearing a mask.  He joined our group for the trip to the Kithcor Woods - and speeded us on our way with a SoW song...<br>
<br>
As we reached the dark woods the sun began to set, and our bard friend went Link Dead.  After much deliberation we decided to chance the woods at night.  Sazarius, who had scouted the route the day before, took us around the cliffs encircling the evil forest.  I can only imagine what deadly creatures lurked in the woods at night.  Later that night we finally found the entrance to Rivervale and made our way into the city.<br>
<br>
The guards did not immediately attack - although I did not get a chance to try the merchants.  We made our way accross the town quickly and exited into Misty Thicket. We went north along an impenetrable cliff, until we came to a large wall, designed to protect the mound homes of the Halflings here.  There was no gate, but a ramp led to the top of the wall.  We all jumped for it and entered a land of desolation.<br>
<br>
My fellow elfs became grim as we moved through a land devoid of trees.  Tree stumps stretched out as far as the eye could see on this side of the wall.  Followers of Tunare in our group muttered prayers for the decimated earth.   Here I saw black bears for the first time.  The trade skill I have chosen is tailoring, and backpacks can be made from black bear fur - I made a note to hunt the bears at a later time.  We made our way in the darkness past a goblin camp to the entrance to the Runnyeye Citadel.<br>
<br>
The entrance was fairly quiet this time of night.  We prepared ourselves for a scouting expedition into the Citadel.  I took the moment of peace to conjure all my supplies and even had time to smoke my rune carved pipe for a few peaceful moments.  We entered the first floor of the Citadel and made our way past the guards that were there.  Several of the guards agro'd on me - even though they were green to me - much more feisty than the Orcs in Crush Bone.  We put them down quickly and made our way to the entrance to Emperor Xorbb's Canyon.  Since we had little time left in the night (RL time that is), we decided to go into the Canyon and do a little hunting there.<br>
<br>
Xorbb's Canyon is a maze of impossibly high cliff walls, with little if any safe spaces.  All combat is channelized along the floor of the canyon, with very few options as to direction of travel - trains can be wicked here.  We saw our first canyon minotar and he came on with a grotesque noise and the fight was on.  He con'd blue to me - and I could have soloed him, except when the fight progressed, muddites and goblins would also agro into the battle.  We managed to kill everything and got some fairly decent exp.  We killed several more of these, then we logged for the night.<br>
<br>
The next night (last night in RL time), we decided to explore the Citadel.  We entered the place and began fighting goblins almost immediately.  We met one of several high level (40+) Dark Elfs that was hunting the Citadel - who warned us that we were in over our heads.  One of our group decided to pull the gobs from a particular room, but he pulled 8 con'd yellow and red gobs onto us.  Everyone took off running except me and the pets who taunted the gobs for several seconds to give the group time to get away.  I then decided to run as well; but, I ran too late, and the mobs killed me just as I got to the entrance to the Canyon.  I came back and looted my corpse, then we decended into the 2nd level (bypassing the room we saw), and killed a few more.  Then we began to go down further, and the Evil Eye that haunts the place caught sight of us!  The run was on - we ran as fast as we could back to the surface, and zoned accross into the Canyon just as the Evil Eye began to attack our group.<br>
<br>
At this point we decided we needed to level up a little more before we began penetrating the Citadel again.  We killed many minotars and muddite eldars for some decent experience that night, though we had several instances of our group leader going LD, and the group bug bit me (this is where if the leader of the group logs or goes LD before the group is disbanded, then you can't disband yourself, or join another group - the only way to clear this that we found was to camp and then relogin) so I decided to solo until my pet died, then camp and relog.  I killed a minotar and a muddite eldar by myself, then it was time to camp as the time (RL) was late.<br>
<br>
This area definitely looks challenging from a NPC standpoint.  The location is also very close to HHP, and I have already seen some KOS guilds that I will pursue as we get the lay of the land. <p>Dorkmid

King's level. We fought many goblins in an endless procession. I died<br>
twice in the process, but did manage to get about 1/2 bubble of exp. <br>
<br>
After several of our members camped (cleric and rogue), we thought it<br>
the better part of valor to ascend back into the light. That left 2<br>
mages and a ranger to take on the minotaurs and evil eyes. We killed<br>
several Minotaurs and Muddite Eldars, and then someone pulled an evil<br>
eye enchanter. He attempted to enchant me, but his spell failed. He then<br>
enchanted Ouijia who started to beat up our Ranger. I knew we were in<br>
trouble then, and nuked the eye until it was a ball of burning mush.<br>
However this did not break the enchantment of our arche mage, who<br>
continued to beat down our Ranger. The ranger made a hasty get away to<br>
the zone with little life left, then our 'friend' came for me. I also<br>
beat feet for the zone and managed to zone with minimal damage. <br>
<br>
We regrouped and continued to kill Mino's and Eldars. Our Ranger camped<br>
shortly thereafter, and it was just 2 mages against the minions of the<br>
gorge. We bagged several more Mino's and Eldars, then we heard a call<br>
from our guild brother Lerdar to go hunting in the Karanas. We met him<br>
in the gorge, and decided to go with him to see how the hunting was<br>
there. <br>
<br>
Hunting in East Karana was very good. We bagged a number of hounds and<br>
spiders, and to cap off the evening, the cyclops Broon(sp?). We killed<br>
his spawn several times, and I raised my 1h blunt melee skill to 12 in<br>
the process (woot! - ROFL). He spawns right next to the ramp into<br>
HighHold Pass, which peaked my interest as a good place to pursue PvP.<br>
As it was wayyyy past our bedtimes, Ouijia and myself gated back to our<br>
campsites and settled down for the night. <p>Dorkmid

<br>
The enchanter in our group and myself - both of the 17th circle - availed ourselves of the bountiful hunting opportunities in East Karana.  We pulled many lions, hounds and snakes.  Killed some human druid bandits, collecting some quest items.  Both of us managed to enter our 18th level, and then we camped.<br>
<br>
There was a shank in the zone, but saw neither hide nor hair of him...I kept my see invisible spell chain casted on both of us to scout him out before he could get in range, but he never showed up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Hunted the Karanas tonight.  Ran about the zone killing mobs - attempted to hunt a KOS PC (who shall remain nameless).  One member of our party saw him in the zone by the river.  We were not able to find him as our Ranger has been out sick, and no one else has tracking.  Our fearless leader decided to take us accross the bridge towards west Karana, and so began our meandering trip of fools.<br>
<br>
To make a long story short, we ended up getting temporarily disoriented (lost) after zoning several times.  We ended up having to call in our ranger (who had been leveling his alt druid - too sick to play, eh?) to find us.  Which he did and brought us back to the Bridge to East Karana.<br>
<br>
We crossed the bridge, and found that the Broon cyclops had just spawned.  We moved in and made short work of him with our ranger, rogue, mage, cleric, and enchanter.  We had just looted him, and were starting to leave when he spawned again.  He immediately agro'd on my lvl 16 pet, and our rogue jumped in, but me the cleric and the enchanter were oom.  We let the pet tank, and took off for the bridge.  We just managed to get off a 'Broon coming!' warning to some others huddled near the foot of the bridge before Broon got there and we zoned.<br>
<br>
Apparently they were able to take him since we found the body of Broon at the foot of the bridge when we zoned in.  We also saw them fighting and kill another Broon nearby - so all was well (I was worried about giving these guys exp loss due to our mistake).  Most of our party decided to camp for the evening, and I decided to walk back rather than gate, in order to take in some of the geography.  In order to save Lapis I didn't make a pet...<br>
<br>
Wrong move on both counts.  I encountered 4 mucktails that ate my lunch.  I tried to fight, but could not land any spells.  My melee was little better (you crush a mucktail for 1pt of damage).  I ran up the HHP ramp to a good high point, and then jumped to my death to avoid exp loss at the last moment.  I left my body there and camped as I was mentally exhausted from all the running around.<br>
<br>
3/15<br>
Got my corpse.  Did some trading.  Camped.<br>
<br>
3/17<br>
Another quiet night in East Karana, solo.  Bagged numerous gorge hounds, and other sundry mobs that con'd blue or white to me.  Made 2 bubs exp in 3 hours.<br>
<br>
<br>
I did get a challenge from a 'Dorkmidrot' - said he was coming for me - lol.  I told him to bring it on.  He never showed his head in my zone however. <p>Dorkmid

<br>
Met my group already engaged in the Warlord room in the bottom level of Runnyeye.  Fought many mobs, then our ranger brought in a gaggle-mob that undid us - when our cleric, enchanter, and rogue bolted, I knew it was time to depart and backed up to a wall and managed to get off the gate.  Came running from my bind point and heard the group members who made it out in a fight...thought it was with the original mob.<br>
<br>
When I got there, turned out they were fighting Chompers!  The dead Trollie was streatched out at the entrance to Xorrb's Gorge inside Runnyeye.  While we were medding he came back to get his corpse - and we exchanged pleasantries ('Roasted Elf meat good - Yar').  He is definitely in our range - heheh.<br>
<br>
/salute Chompers<br>
<br>
After that our Ranger had to log, so we took Minos and Muddites in the Gorge for a bit.  Then we practiced our PvP tactics on each other at the entrance to the gorge.  We would fight each other down to 1/2 bub, then the lowest elf would zone to give the zone-wide 'so and so has lost a duel to the death with so and so'.  Good fun, and educational too. <p>Dorkmid

Pesky critters - ate our lunch on several occaisions when more than one was pulled.  Had a run-in with a DE mage that was on CR.  He just sat next to us for about 10 minutes medding - when we asked, he said he was on CR.  After about another minute of this (and we had killed the gnoll we were fighting), I went after him and put him down.  He bitched about petitioning me, because he was on a CR.  I told him to get away from us and go loot his corpse and leave (his bind point was directly behind our camp).  The second time he loots his corpse and apparently leaves.  <br>
<br>
About 10 mins later he shows up with a buddy of his (who incidentaly had been killed by Ouijia very recently) - and they precede to kill us lom.  I die, and I think several others of us die (can't remember exactly).  I return from my bind point, and loot.  Check the zone - they are gone - so I stay (also considering that they did not LnS after fair combat with us).  After about 1/2 hour of killing gnolls they show up again.  We envelop them.  I travel through the trees to their right, arcing around to their flank - our group hits them from both sides simultaneously - they backpeddle toward a ridge north of Splitpaw, as we chew at them (wish I had the 16 lvl earth pet at times like this).  Then they split up, the mage heads for split paw, the necro stays hidden on the ridge.  Ouijia (mage) and Bartakus (rogue) take on the mage who continues running toward Split Paw.  Me and Zantana (Cleric) who are on the backside of the ridge - follow in pursuit.  Then the necro strikes our Cleric with his bone pet.  <br>
<br>
I have to jump in and help (pet and necro con red to me) - The cleric and I are the lowest members of our group, fighting the highest member of thier group. Our highest level members are fighting thier lowest member (mage conned yellow to me) and quickly kill him.  By the time they finish up the mage I am dead, and our Cleric is not far behind.  I loot and scoot and logout.<br>
<br>
Saturday - 3/24 - Logged my alt Bard in Kelethin for shorty killin'.  Met up with several other low levels and commenced to gather exp while we waited for the pecks to show(I was level 4 at start of night).  Got into several fights on orc hill - unfortunately most were out of my range.  Did manage to assist on one fight - two halflings in black armor - both conned red to me.  I managed to hit the lower of the two to little effect.  <br>
<br>
Met Aurras on the hill - enjoyed watching her punish a shorty who refused to LnS...heh<br>
<br>
After a while of this - decided to go to Kaladim to do the bone chip quest (had 40 chips).  Ended up in a fight with a red con dwarf who chased me all the way to the Paladin guild and put me down there.  After I looted, noticed that my killer had logged, so I completed the quest and returned to Orc hill.  Mostly just exp after that.  To make a long story short, my low bard lost the field to a Euridite Necro.  So, I moved over to the newbie area near Kelethin.  Got some exp, then a gnome mage rooted me with earth pet, and put me down.  As I was encumbered - I banked, and logged.<br>
<br>
Sunday - 3/25 - Solo'd East Karana for a while - gorge hounds only thing giving me exp...  So I moved to the south side of the zone (Nearer to HHP ramp).  While crossing a hill saw Barbarian Shank in Valley below - attempted to give him a wide berth since he conned red, but he and already seen me and was altering course to intercept.  I circled, readied for battle - and buffed pet at last instant as we closed - and the fight was on!  We traded a few blows, then a lion agro'd in and ended up on the Barb.  I pulled off my pet and preceded to help the Barb kill the lion, after which we continued the fight.  Unfortunately, just as we began again - 2 of his friends arrived - one of which was a Shaman who promptly rooted me, and slapped a DoT on me.  I died very quickly after that.  /salute Shanks.  Good battle - even managed to get the red con down 50% str... not bad for level 18 mage with level 16 pet.  The Barb sent me a good /tell - altogether a fun time.<br>
<br>
When I zoned into my bind point was immediately attacked by shorties - with caster's nerf for PvP i was oom and dieing fast.  Zone danced in and out of Runnyeye to get up enough mana (these halflings conned blue to me), then I cast invis, and made my way to a safe place to med up and move back to get my corpse.  Apparently the halflings didn't like my guild tag - heheh.  One of them told me the only one attacking me was a particular member of their party(which I knew to be false).  I told him, 'thats alright; all my gear is on my corpse in East Karana.  I'll be back to have a chat with your friend'.  After that I made my way to my corpse, looted and gated back to my bind point - hoping to see the halflings.  Unfortunately they had all logged out by the time I got back  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I had to eat dinner, so I went invis and parked Dorkmid outside of Runnyeye on the Misty Thicket side.  When I came back I notice I am dead, and two halflings are there talking about me and Illuvitae.  Apparently they think we are like the peck guild 'Little Killers' - and held us and the 'killers in low regard.  Some funny stuff.  Then they went on to get thier jollies off my predicament.  After a little more of this I looted and scooted (making a note to change my bind point), on to Split Paw.<br>
<br>
Just as I entered Split Paw - server crashed!  Wasn't able to login for a while.  When I did login, all my logistical stuff was gone (10 each bread and water and 36 bandages - ouch) as well as my pet (one wasted Lapis stone).  Had to do a little multitasking to get where I needed to be, then helped Ouijia, Zantana, and Bartakus clear the first room of Gnolls.  As we were fighting Gnolls, several DEs passed through.  Another DE shadowed us the rest of the time we were there - conned red to our highest member.  But he made no moves to attack us.  Some experience, but my group decided to log out and I was just getting warmed up.  I logged my Bard and made level 6 and 3 bubs (from 4 ) in about 2 1/2 hours on orc hill - with good group.  Managed to weave 3 songs at a time (selos, restore, and haste buff) while pulling and fighting orc centurians - woot!  I hate to say this, but I am really enjoying the Bard.<br>

Several of our members have surpassed lvl 20, and the others are not too far behind.  I left a young lvl 16 elf magician.  I returned a level 18 (1/4 bub to 19) elf mage, sage in the ways of the wider world.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
The top ten reasons we left Tunaria (Antonica):<br>
<br>
10.  Didn't like the Fish Cakes from Barbarian in the white tower bridge to South Karana (gave us all some bad gas).<br>
<br>
9.  Gnolls in Split Paw did not show the hospitality we came to expect from a 5 star dungeon.<br>
<br>
8.  Dorkmid's insistence 'its only a gorge hound', as a Lion Patriarch and 2 more gorge hounds arrive...<br>
<br>
7.  'Death of a Cleric' went from being a subject of debate, to being a cliche...(sorry Zan)<br>
<br>
6.  Muddite eldars and Minotars gave new meaning to the phrase 'ripped a new one'...<br>
<br>
5.  Riverdale Halflings were getting restless...<br>
<br>
4.  Ouijia's natural sense of direction is not natural...<br>
<br>
3.  Spent half hour trying to swim the Serpent River before I realized I wasn't getting anywhere...<br>
<br>
2.  Angry Droon...'nuff said  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
And the number 1 reason we left Tunaria:<br>
<br>
1.  Shanks weren't as friendly as we had come to expect from the vacation literature...<br>
<br>
<br>
I would like to thank all my companions for our successful expedition, and hope to have many more in the future.<br>
