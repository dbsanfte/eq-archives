<br>
    Faydark is dying...Tunare is whithering and we are Tunares only chance for survival.<br>
<br>
    Remove the outsiders and keep them out.....one day we can take the battle to THEIR homes but for now cleanse the Fay and reclaim our heritage ...our bloodrite.<br>
<br>
    Perhaps Tunare has spoken to us and choosen us to enact her rage.Protect the elves..the forest and its inhabitants.<br>
<br>
    Illuvitae - Tunares choosen...we represent her will and her anger.<br>
<br>
    We are the shadows around you, the trees above you, the ground beneath you.<br>

Hows that?<br>

lol, seriously... that's about what I had in mind too.  We can be like the Rebellion within the &quot;Lightie Alliance&quot;.  Embraced by few, cast out by most of our own kind.  Elvin Assassins, Outlaw Immortals, Faydwers Rebellion.  That could be some good tag lines there. <p><b>Ceescrit Bossalini</b><BR>

<br>
The humans and shorter races use and abuse our lands because they have either already filthied their own or would rather leave a mess for others to clean up.  As Gheist said they have no regard for the many of Tunare's creatures that inhabit Faydark and how their actions effect us.  I for one cannot tolerate this and believe we must begin cleansing the area surrounding our beloved cities of Kelethin and Felwithe before it is too late.<br>
<br>
The road we take after that has many branches and destinations.  These we will navigate as they come before us. <p>Valindel, Illuvitae

I am Xaeria Sol'are, the last member of House Sol'are within Felwithe.  Tunare is weeping my brothers and sisters, weeping as her glorious creations are plundered by outsiders who care not what they do.  But I am getting ahead of myself, you must know more about me before you will trust me...<br>
<br>
I was born of noble blood in Felwithe, my father a Paladin loyal to the good king Thex, my mother a cleric in service of Tunare.  I was to be raised in my mother's path, as a cleric, as I was already starting to show talent for healing. My eldest brother had just entered into his first season as a holy knight.  House Sol'are was small, but well respected for our faith.  My kin believed that peaceful diplomacy would save the elven race, and being but a child, I listened to them.  If only they knew then what I know now, they would not have followed faith so blindly.  <br>
<br>
It was a diplomatic mission to Ak'Anon, city of gnomes.  My mother, her escort, my father, and also my brother's company were dispatched to quell a dispute between the Keepers of the Art and the Eldritch collective over rights to ancient tomes.  Although it was considered boring to a little girl, I was allowed to come along. It was a simple mission, nothing should have gone wrong! But we never made it to Ak'Anon, and no one but me made it back to Felwithe alive.  <br>
<br>
Have you ever heard of the Dark Reflection?  A small group of gnomes that live deep in eroded mines, almost ignored by the Eldritch Collective, and allowed to practice the most foul corruption of magic, necromancy.  Out of Ak'Anon vomits hundreds of these gnomes, like the foulest bile, desecrating the green of the forest. It was these gnomes that our party encountered in the Faydark that day, an ambush.  I can still see the way my father raised his gleaming blade against thier minions, the wrath my mother called down from the heavens. I remember the pain in his voice as he told my brother to take me to safety. I remember the way my brother, never looking so terrified, scooped me up in his strong arms and carried my away from the battle.  We hid together, me with a small doll, him with his sword, crying as we heard our parents fall to the dark magic.  We stayed hidden for hours, untill we thought they were all gone...but we were wrong.  Out of the Shadows came a small figure, and out of the ground lurched a terrible being.  My brother was no match for it, or its tiny master. He fought as valiantly as he could, using what magic he could muster against the evil.  But it was in vain, for as I watched, horrified, the last member of my family was struck down by a seething bolt of venom.  I should have died that day, but I was made to live on.  The gnome did not kill me, instead he cast a ritual spell on me, a terrible affliction.  I could feel with horrible agony as every last bit of talent I had for healing was slowly twisted out of me.  I was half dead, alone, and completly powerless when I staggered into the gates of Felwithe.  <br>
<br>
I was taken in by the healers of Tunare, but there was nothing they could do.  I had been scarred by the plaguebringer, no healing could ever allow me to embrace Tunare's love again. The finest clerics just looked at me and shook their heads as though I had died in the forest.  In some way, I am sure I did. I grew into a bitter, angry young woman.  The good king made sure I was provided for, but I was never satisfied.  I wanted revenge, but Felwithe would not commit itself to war.  The rage inside me grew, until it felt as though I could burn holes with my glare. Felwithe was afraid to speak with me, I was a lost cause, a fallen angel. It was Solusek Ro that came to me with an answer.  <br>
<br>
Ro saw the burning fires inside me and strengthened them.  I learned to control my anger, channel my inner flames, and in that way, I began the wizardly arts.  No one would train me, not even Tarker Blazetoss, the local guildmaster.  In truth, they were afraid of what I might do. I instead taught myself, mastering fire, magic, and ice as my weapons.  I roamed free, travelled through the world, seeking answers to my question, why?  Why was I made to suffer? Did Tunare love me as I was taught as a child? If so, why did she allow such pain to befall her children? At last I found it, the answer.<br>
<br>
We had become weak, passive, dominated.  Outsiders who cared nothing for the forest were allowed to tresspass inside it, they desecrated it with thier presence.  A pack of dwarves came through to steal what they could from young elves, instead they found me.  Burning every last one of them with my power, it was that day that I embraced Tunare once more.  Tunare loves the elven race, only the elven race.  Humans, Dwarves, Gnomes...they are all parasites on Tunare's beautiful world.  Would you let an gnome come to your city? If so, they why not an orc? Or a dark elf?  They all have the same plans...murder and destruction.  I will avenge my family's death with every blast from my hands.  I will not allow Tunare's gifts to go soiled any longer, and that is why I have joined you, others who feel the same way.  <br>
<br>
For me, Illuvitae is the shining light of Tunare's love in the darkness.  <br>
