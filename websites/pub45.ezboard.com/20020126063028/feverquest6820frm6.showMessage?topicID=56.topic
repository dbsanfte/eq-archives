Already the trees were starting to die, a formless green fungi attacking their roots and leaves.  Many battles he had faught, won and lost, and his scarred and withered face showed it.  His hand went to the pouch on his belt, the remainder of his meager coin.  His fortunes for some time had been spiralling down, only moments it seemed from his lowest point.<br>
<br>
He looked about him, and other than the ragged trees saw neither beast nor the folk that inhabited these parts.  What was happening - why was his quest and his virtue not enough to turn the tide on this evil that was creeping in?  Immediately before him the goddess Tunare appeared - very tall and imposing, vines entwining her body.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mortal!  Stand up! Don't grovel at my feet - I have much for you to do and we have little time...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I beg pardon.  But, I have never faced a goddess or a god for that matter...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nevermind, your mindless following of that dolt Mithaniel Mar has only lead you to this destruction - has it not?  What honor and virtue lies on your path now?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;None your worshipfulness.  But, is he not an ally to you...?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes yes.  But you are not a paladin, you bend the elements to your whim, and Mithaniel looks down upon your feable desires to be like us...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ummm, if you say so...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;AND I DO SAY SO!!&quot;, and a great wind came from her and knocked the mage back upon the ground.  He got up slowly and she continued, &quot;I do have pity on your feable soul and have other uses for your latent talents - you will go to another land and help tame the evil that is there.  Your skills will be more useful as well and you shall worship me and spread my word.  Your time here is through...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do I get a say - ?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No you do not...prepare for your rebirth young dork-mage...&quot;, and with that a wave of lightning began to play across the horizon, moving ever closer, and suddenly accross the closest hills.  The magician dropped his coin purse upon the road, his hands shaking.  Immediately the storm was upon him and lightening wracked his body, burning away all that was him in this world.  The smoking coin purse the only remains of what once was a High Elf.<br>
<br>
The magician awoke to the strains of an elven roundel - listening he sat up and surveyed his surroundings.  The stonework he knew well, for as a child he had once played by this very wall.  He was in Felwithe.  His rags where gone, and in thier place an apprentice's robe and dagger.  His mind pricked of these things these familiars, and yet - he did not know his name....who was this elf of Felwithe?  He felt he had a purpose, and somewhere in the back of his mind it came to him.  Tunare!  Like a bolt of lightning it was apparent.  He must do good for this world!  He must spread the word of Tunare to heal mother earth of the creeping evil and those corrupted by it even in this faire city.  He stood up and strode forward toward the entrance of the Faydark, clear in his mission...<br>
