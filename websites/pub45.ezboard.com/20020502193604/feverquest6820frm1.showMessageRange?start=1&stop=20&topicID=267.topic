Your enemies shouldn't be stupid enough to attack when you have a healer with you.<br><br>Of course if you are more than 8 levels higher or lower than your teammate, you may not heal them at all during pvp.

So I'll try to explain it the best I can, civilly.<br><br>First and foremost, the charter is most definitely up to date.  Less than a few months ago, it was even put up for public scrutiny on the pwned.com server message board, and no one had a problem with it at all.  From Defiant to Xanit, no one had any problem with these policies, and thought it to be right on par with their own.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I reason I am asking is that one of your members is 51 and they attacked a 55 lvl, and a 60 lvl chanter helped the 55 lvl. By you rules that would not be a problem. But she is complaining that they could not hit the 60 and so was OOR healing (or should I saying buffing).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Two things here:<br><br>1) Spurnia INITIATED the attack on our exp group.  Not only was Vaunt (level 60) OOR healing/runing/whatever, this was also IMMORTAL (Vaunt being on the elven team) which makes it twice as bad, and also OFFENSIVE (and not defensive immy/oor) which makes it 3 times as bad.<br><br>2) Our charter only states that OOR healing (since being all elves, we have no immortal situations, ever) is ONLY acceptable if somone else initiates the attack on your in-range hunting group.  Thus the 8 level limit, and it is never to be an offensive move.<br><br>Reasons we can justify (and everyone else accepts it) doing this, are many.  The major one being, that as a 1 team guild that choses to KOS all non-elves, this severly limits who and where we can exp together and with.  Everywhere we go, we're getting griefed, immy healed against, trained, corpse camped, etc.  We figured this would be the only acceptable way to help and even the odds against us, without being dishonorable in PvP.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Another guestion you charter also says that your guild is suppose to have it tag up, except in certain conditions. Can you clarify when those conditions are.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>&quot;Soldiers of the Illvuitae family should always proudly wear their tags, unless they feel it will be extremely bad in certain situations to do so.  We must stick together, and show our names and faces even in the times of greif.  You should never deny your brother and sister elves and exp group or PvP assistance whenever permitted.&quot;<br><br>Is exactly what it says.  That seems pretty straight forward to me, and an internal policy.  I'm not sure why it would concern anyone but officers in our guild, for keeping track of people.<br><br>For your amusement, I can give you an example where I would consider it acceptable for a member not to wear their guildtag.  If a druid of ours was out soloing (exp), in a zone with potential enemies that she knew she could not have a chance at putting up a fight against, it would be ok to hide her guildtag so as not to be as easily noticed.  We don't have the luxury of just walking into a zone like Sol B or Velks and getting a pickup group or merrily exping along with the other lighties.  Sometimes there's just no other choice than to be discreet about ourselves when trying to get some levels.  But like I said, it shouldn't concern anyone but officers of Illuvitae, whether somone is wearing their guildtag or not.  It only takes a few seconds for somone to type /guildstatus.<br><br>I hope this clears everything up for you, because that's about as clear cut as I can get.

Also you have cleared the issue on what you feel is IMH and what is not.

Guilds like your and other are the reason I play on this server.  I do not do alot of pking myself, but I could not play on a bluebie server where you know what danager is out there once you get a zone down, know where all the mobs are what they will do.  Your guild and others that enjoy PKing come into a zone and add a new element to the zone.  It is fun trying to figure out how to fight the new treat and even in dead, the blood run alittle faster.  Sometime at the moment I may not have enjoyed it, but later when I think back it usually had fun to it.  Once in awhile being human I might give the pker grif, very rare, but must of the time I will say I am sorry later that was in the heat of the moment.<br><br>Some have not said not nice things about the people in you guild, but some have been Amazons with me and other I have hunted with before the chose this hard life and I know what they are like.  <br><br>So good hunting.<br><br>Bendenw Darkmoon, Advisor to the Queen Mother <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub45.ezboard.com/utulweyen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tulweyen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dread Pirate Tul</span><br>  Posts: 748<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(4/11/02 11:36:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/feverquest6820frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=267.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> "Guilds like your and other are the reason I play on this server."<br><br>I'm glad we can spice up your otherwise blue server experience.

And it can always be said back that, you knew the rules on this server that you can IMH, both race and lvl and if you do not like it go to a server like Solon with it pop of 600 people.<br><br>I have alway wondered when they talked about Hard Coding, if they had given us a chose like when they where thinking of keeping this server as coin and lot and the other server as coin only and the two servers could pick where to go, and 85 percent wanted the other server and only 15 percent want this server, so it was called off.  If they did the same think with Hard Coding and made one server like it is and the other Hard Coding, how many people would want to play on the Hard Coded server and how many want to play on the server like it is now.  I know they taught long and hard about Hard Coding and they did not do it, so there must have been a reason.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#A8A8A8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub45.ezboard.com/uceescritdabossalini.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ceescrit da Bossalini</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Da Boss</span><br>  Posts: 645<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(4/11/02 12:10:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/feverquest6820frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=267.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.aztecmfgcorp.com/_private/eq/avatar2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> The reason for no hard coding simply boils down to the fact it will be more work for Verant then its worth.  To make everyone happy, they'd have to hard code one server (either VZ or TZ) as 4 teams, and another as Light vs. Dark or FFA (ala Rallos, w/o item loot) and open up a /movelog in between the two.  The bottom line is though, less than 15% of all their customers play on Red (PvP) servers.  <br><br>So what they did in the end (way to go Verant), was open up Sullon Zek, and said lets be done with it.  No rules, 3 extremely unbalaced teams, legal training, corpse/bind camping for exp loss... no thanks.  I've played on this server for 2 years now, and it took me that long to get Ceescrit to level 52 and epic.  I think I'd rather quit than start over from scratch. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#778899><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub45.ezboard.com/ubendenwdarkmoon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bendenw Darkmoon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(4/11/02 12:42:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub45.ezboard.com/feverquest6820frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=267.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Ceescrit it would not take you that long to start over, I started a new character in December and now the character is 47 on this server.

Your enemies shouldn't be stupid enough to attack when you have a healer with you.<br><br>Of course if you are more than 8 levels higher or lower than your teammate, you may not heal them at all during pvp.
