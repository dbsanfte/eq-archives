I cautioned strongly about messing with any ability that defines a class.  The nerf to assassin stealth after a crit, IMO, strikes at the heart of what defines an assassin.  Assassins cannot critical strike unless they are hidden and do substantially less damage than tanks without critical strike (typically an assassin who misses his critical strike is dead).<br><br>The problem, as I’ve been told is the frequent ganking of greys by a sole assassin and chain rez-killing.  Lunasea was victim to those several times and it’s frustrating and takes away from the enjoyment of the game.  IMO, causing assassins to appear after a 1-shot attack will resolve the problem as stated but is NOT a good solution.  It ruins the assassin class.<br><br>Consider the features of an assassin:<br>· Limited to leather armor<br>· Second fewest hit points in the game<br>· Stealth speed is dramatically slower forcing assassins to typically go solo<br>· The damage that most assassins do (Shadowblades possibly excluded) is too low to kill any except archers, casters, and other assassins.<br>· Archers are located far away.  With See Hidden Infiltrators can probably locate them but See Hidden is likely to be dramatically reduced soon (as I think it should be)<br>· Finding an assassin is like searching for a needle in a haystack so they are not a feasible prey to consistently hunt.<br>· Casters are typically located at the back of an enemy force<br><br>I already mentioned that the nerf will probably be very effective on achieving its goal so lets see how it will likely effect assassins.<br><br>Scenario 1<br>Assassin crits and kills a caster behind enemy lines (it’s where they’re located).  He 1-shots but immediately unstealths and dies behind enemy lines.  The caster is then rez’d while the infiltrator must release.<br><br>Scenario 2<br>The assassin joins a group, and so forgoes stealth almost entirely.  Battle begins and he joins the fray where he dies 2 – 3 hits later to a Troll warrior or hib caster.  His group’s tanks kill Troll or caster fairly quickly and then rez the infiltrator (he received no/few RP’s since he died so quickly) or must avoid joining battles and so is useless to the group.  In either event the Infiltrator finds it as difficult to find a group in RvR as it is in PvE.<br><br>Scenario 3<br>Fortunately Infiltrators have See Hidden (although Mythic has already mentioned that ability specifically as likely to be reduced – IMO See Hidden is way too powerful).  So although they can no longer join the battle they can stand around and protect casters as they med or archers as they pick off casters from long range.  Or they could go stealth and scout behind enemy lines, directing an attack.  They won’t actually get any RP’s for this work and they’ll expose themselves to greater risk than any other class.  We could use poison but with the new realm abilities people can now remove the effects after a tick or two (in a couple of ticks Lifebane would cause under 200 points of damage for an Infiltrator).<br><br>We’re still good for scaling walls and killing the archers (that provide no realm points) or maybe kill the few casters who attempt to AoE down onto our forces during a siege.  We can also guard the climb points when our fort is under siege.  All and all a VERY exciting future.<br><br>I strongly believe that there are other and better ways to achieve the goal of reducing grey ganking and chain rez killing:<br>· Critical hits don’t work on people who have rez effects (if this is the case then also dramatically increase the side-effects of rez effects so the person cannot effectively battle either).<br>· Give all casters AoE spells centered on themselves (this will expose any hidden person nearby).<br>· Give a small chance (say 10%) that an assassin will appear even if they 1-shot<br>· I’m sure there are other and even better solutions that could solve the problem without destroying the playability of an assassin.<br><br>This is my second character that has been nerfed to the point that I don’t think it’s effctive in RvR.  Personally I find fighting for XP boring.  I leveled my assassin for 1 reason: RvR.  I tried creating Midgard character but the thought of having to level so I could RvR (40+ levels) is just too much.  <br><br>So now I’m left with deciding what I want to do.  At the moment I don’t know, but I’m considering leaving the game.  Mythic is beginning to feel more and more like Verant (at least Verant didn’t nerf based on # of bitches – Necro’s never got nerfed bad).  Forgotten Truth is the best guild I’ve been part of and I really enjoy playing with my guildmates.  I also do not like giving money to companies that act like Verant or Mythic is currently.  I will stay on through the June 1 event.  I’ll let you all know if I decide to play past that.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6B8E23><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ucreepypete.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CreepyPete</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(5/14/02 5:13:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1130.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mythic and nerfs - long</span><hr size=1> Sorry I pissed you off so much last night, Luna. If I were still playing Creepy I *might* be mad too.<br><br>I don't have much of a problem with the nerf itself, I have more of a problem with the manner in which it was enacted. Sort of cowardly if you ask me. <br><br>Anyways having been more and more immersed in Morrowind these days I've been thinking about it a lot and it comes down to a difference in ideology between programming single player versus multiplayer games. <br><br>In a single player game it's simple to make the player feel like Captain Badass. No one suffers because Player 1 is the literal incarnation of death, other than NPCs and they dont count.<br><br>In a multiplayer game it's a little tougher. To reuse my <br>Die Hard analogy, everyone wants to be McClain but nobody wants to be Fritz. When a lot of someones all end up being Fritz all the time that's a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Bad Thing</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. You can't tell me you haven't noticed a definent trend towards &quot;Be stealth or don't bother&quot;. (Been to the BGs recently? Quite a few people there, but you can't see any) That again is indicative of a problem.<br><br>The radical influx of Archers and Assassin type classes should have indicated that this was a problem early on. Assassins needed a little help prior to 2.2/2.5x spec points, but I think those spec points were what pushed em up a little bit too high and the subsequent class numbers will reflect this. I used to be one of about 15-20 Infs on Palomides until the day they got more spec points. Then it was 80+. I'd bet it was a LOT more than that right up until before this nerf, too.<br><br>Assassin classes are a bitch to balance. They're a whole class centered around using what society considers unfair advantages. How do you institute Pick Pockets against players without pissing off the other 95% of the server?<br><br>I know all the arguments for steallthed 1 shots staying in game, but be honest: Are anonymous one shot kills GOOD for the game? I'm not asking if they're good for you, I'm sure they're excellent for all the McClains out there. I bet they laugh and laugh everytime one happens. Bottom line is they're not good for Fritz. One shots make you feel like not even bothering to try. All you are is there until someone you <br><br>1) Can't see<br><br>2) Can't run from (cept not coming to RvR at all)<br><br>3) Can't fight <br><br>kills your whole group again. I'm not singling out Assassins here. Archers are equally guilty of this and arguably moreso, as they do the same thing from range and again, basically without fear of repercussion.<br><br>No other classes can do this without the group having a chance, even just a tiny one, not to die. Again, I've heard the arguments. A 50th level berserker will OWN a group of 8 30s. Well, except for the fact that he'd prolly be seen coming and if you ran when you saw him you might be ok. Hell, he might only kill 2 or 3 of you if he popped in right on top of you and commenced to killin' IF you bolted 1st thing. And there's a chance, albeit a TINY, TINY chance that you might be able to stick a spell on him and run like hell.<br><br>With Assassins and Archers you don't even have that chance and people who AREN'T stealth based are tired of it night after night. <br><br>When I run up over a ridge and see that purple to me Eldritch casting something...well, soon as I release I learn to be careful about running blindly anywhere.<br><br>What does being stealth one shotted teach me? Don't be in range of people you can't see? Don't go to RvR without a See Hidden class? Nah, teaches you not to go to RvR.<br><br>I've played a rogue for years and while I'd love to side with the rogues on this one, in good conscience I cannot. This will not even be close to the end of the assassin classes. The good ones will stay. The ones who relied mostly on an overpowered skill rather than using even rudimentary tactics will not. (The Church is gonna be crowded next week, I predict, clerics still have that flavor of the month thing going on) Assassin players are among the best of the badasses among players and one of the reasons they are is that they've been forced to use every damn advantage they can in combat because they've always been underpowered.<br><br>This will weed out the field a little is all. So you can't solo in RvR anymore? Who can these days? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bforgottentruthforeignlegion.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=lunasea>lunasea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(5/14/02 6:30:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1130.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mythic and nerfs - long</span><hr size=1> You didn't piss me off Creepy.  Our conversation made me realize how much the nerf pissed me off.  I disagree with your arguments (and still do).<br><br>The world of the infiltrator is not at all like presume it to be.  It's difficult to get the kill but extremely rewarding.  The advantage that assassins have is they choose the time and place.  If we plan properly we get the kill.  If we don't we die.<br><br>As Dalth can attest I didn't start out too well <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I have learned to be more cautious and avoid groups as an infiltrator because they simply can't take the hits.<br><br>You and I are arguing different points.  To me you want a game where everyone is equal.  This predicates your arguments and colors your opinion.  I see everyone as having a strength and weakness.  This predicates my arguments and colors my opinion.<br><br>We both agree that 1 assassin wiping out entire groups or chain rez-killing needs to change.  I see this as the core of the problem whereas you appear to see it as a symptom.  In my worldview the fix should address reduce or remove the ability to kill entire groups (which I honestly don't see or hear often of) and chain rez-killing (which I do see).  I believe that problem can be addressed without undercutting the nature of assassins.<br><br>In your worldview how these people died is the symptom.  To solve the problem requires addressing the nature of stealthed critical attacks.  In order to fix that dramatically altering the assassin class is required.  You justified (during our discussion) this action because rogues make up only about 5% of the population.  the implication being that the happiness of the majority outweighs that of the few.<br><br>Despite that I disagree with the very premise of your arguments I think the solution is poor even if your arguments are accepted.  I also take great exception to Mythic lying about the situtation (I can think of no other word then deliberate lying given past postings and current handling).<br><br>Removing the stealth through a 1-shot is akin to allowing casters to wear leather armor, giving them an extra 300hp, and making all spells PBAE with a radius of a sword length.  Is that a problem?  Using your logic the answer is no.  Spells can be cast from a range that melee can't defend against and they cause a lot of damage.  If a group of greys were caught by one then a caster with an AoE could kill the entire party with impunity.  This bug fix is nothing more than giving everyone a fair chance.<br><br>Likewise tanks hit too hard and are too hard to melee by casters.  So lets allow only 1 style per battle per tank.  We'll also reduce the AF on all armor to the equivalent of cloth so casters are on equal footing.<br><br><br>If I wanted to play a melee I would have.  I chose an assassin because I thought I would enjoy the style of play.  I love strategy.  Infiltrators require strategy.  It's the same reason I chose an air theurgist over earth.  If you think that assassins, and infiltrators specifically, are uber than you (and anyone else who believes that) have no understanding of the class.<br><br>End result: assassins are nerfed and casters can rejoice.  And more people leave the game.  Maybe everyone remaining will be happier and maybe they won't.  But they can find out without me and my monthly subscription.  I'll log on within the next day or so to hand over all the prizes for the June 1 event that Syko has collected.

No sarcasm whatsoever intended =) ) but you don't really address any points. I'm fine with everyone having strengths and weaknesses. It makes the gameplay worthwhile, imo. I'm NOT ok with any class being able to routinely kill without the slightest chance of a reprisal. That's what you're not getting I think. All classes the same? Who'd want that? All battles even between ANY 2 chars? Not possible really, not if every class is truly different.<br><br>We read the same boards, you and I. We both know that the stealth based classes are an EXTREMELY (to put it mildly) vocal minority. If you were to believe everything you read on those boards Assassins and Archers, ACCORDING to the people who play them, are one of 2 things:<br><br>1) On patch days or when the ol' nerf bat is swinging they're pathetic. I mean worthless..think Champion with narcolepsy. They can't solo in PvE, they can't group in PvE, they can't even kill a blue in RvR, and (insert rogue class from other realm here) have it SOOOO much easier because they're uber, their realm is better, whatever.<br><br>2) Any other time, like when they post their little stories with pictures about who did what to whom, they're friggin' GODS who can slay whole groups with impunity, evade search parties and then come back and do it all over again. <br><br>Oddly enough, if we take a quick look over at the Realm War status boards across all servers you'll find that Archers/Assassins comprise basically half of the top 25 RP earners on any given server, and usually more than half of the top TEN. Of course, they don't really want that information (common knowledge if you pay any attention to deathspam) to get out, (might be misinterpreted, you understand)  so increasingly they're now going anon so that this imbalance is not so easy for the average joe to see. Hard to tell what class they are really, so when I ran into one of those I just ignored it and bumped the list longer by one. I bet they're not all mentalists, tho.<br><br>So someone is kicking a whole lotta ass out there in the Frontiers, but if you ask an Archer or an Assassin you get &quot;Heck no! We suck since nerfX. Can't kill an green anymore&quot; for an answer. Heh. Weird that somehow those RPs just keep on a comin' in, huh? Maybe they're just really lucky.<br><br>As it stood prior to Realm Abilities being added, Stealth was only counterable by bringing your own assassin along in group (If they even want to group for RvR, why split points when you can get em all yourself?) and hoping his net connection and reflexes were faster than the one about to jump you.<br><br>I'm sure you're saying &quot;So where's the problem?&quot;<br><br>The problem is no one else has to do this. I don't NEED to bring a Paladin along in case I run into a Shaman. Nor am I 100% screwed in RvR if there weren't any Pallys around for my group and we do run into a Shaman. Are you following me?<br>Would it be fair to implement some weirdness into the supposed scissors/paper/rock equation that a single Warden can kill your whole group every time unless you happen to be grouped with a Friar? Wow, that sounds like it'd suck, huh? Not for Absynth and Wine, but for everyone else if they couldnt find a group friar. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Should I even add in to the hypothetical equation that my imaginary Friars wouldnt even WANT to group because they can solo in RvR which brings us back to the &quot;no counters&quot; argument again.<br><br>Your AE argument really doesn't hold water either. You ever used an AE damage spell? Unless you're the target or ON the target the damage drops off so significantly with distance (I'm not talking a LOT of distance, either. I mean like ingame 4 feet away from ground zero the damage just sucks) that they're basically only doing significant damage to the target, but the horribly reduced damage you do on everyone else is good for getting RPs off them when something DOES eventually kill 'em.<br><br>Grim put it better than me I guess when he said he's fine with a whole bunch of abilities in RvR as long as there are abilities around to counter them. Pre-Realm Abilities, you were screwed if a stealther took a dislike to your group and you didn't bring your own to the fray. Not enough counters is the problem. Making a random chance to go vis on a successful one shot would have been a nice place to start with this nerf. Maybe it'll get retracted and something like that will go into effect. Personally, I'd start at 20% and go from there, maybe modify it by actual trained levels in Stealth and/or weaponsize too, but then now I'm arguing design philosophy again and Mythic and I do not see eye to eye in that arena either.<br><br>If I didn't know the 1st thing about Assassin classes it'd be one thing, but they (like most players) always wanna have their cake and eat it too, mainly by crying how much they suck to anyone who'll listen on one hand and owning the RP charts on the other. <br><br>I read Safehouse on a more than daily basis and I'm more than a little familiar with the class and the issues with it. I HAVE a level 31 Infiltrator that I leveled up (mostly solo) back when they sucked a lot. Lots of RvR experience? Nope, I just used him as a scout. But it was amazing how long I could go (literally hours in one case) without being found and killed with just a little common sense and Stealth.<br><br>Does it suck that Mythic let you have 1 shots since inception and NOW they decide to take it away? Yep, sure does in anyone's book. That's just bad policy. But I'm telling you, unless you're incredibly untalented this is NOT gonna kill your Assassin unless you let it. With all those spec lines you HAVE to be more than a 1 trick pony. It's the talentless ones that this is gonna hit the hardest and good riddance. You're very lucky in another regard and that's that you have a guild that'll group you pretty much anytime RvR or PvE. Think of the poor slobs that are used to soloing exclusively and now HAVE to try to get a group/learn how to play in a group. This is gonna hit them hard too. <br><br>Can't help you with the &quot;no fun&quot; argument, though. I'm hoping (in vain?) that DAoC holds me until NWN comes out. Then I can nerf the holy hell out of ALL your classes. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/usareshofft.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saresh of FT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(5/14/02 11:15:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1130.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mythic and nerfs - long</span><hr size=1> I asked friends in the game what was the one class no one was playing but the guild needed more of.

Level 8 Inf.  I like her, but I have to say that the whole spec problem is an issue.  We have 2.5x skill points.  I put NONE into stealth, but it gets dragged up with your level (bang goes about .3 of that).  Now then, I want to poison, so I spec poison (there goes 1.0).  OK, I want to be able to hit people in the back (there goes 1.0).  Ahh, that only works when stealthed, arse, and I need to hit things out of stealth, but that's ok, because I want to be able to poison with 2 weapons, dual wield (there goes another 1.0).  Right, now I need to be able to hit things normally slash or pierce (another 1.0).<br><br>So unless you want to compromise that's going to need about 5.0x to use everything at full spec.<br><br>OK, up to this point I haven't made any point other than supporting the 2.2x to 2.5x change.  The thing I am getting at is there are many ways to play an rogue.  Many people have gone the easiest route.<br><br>As Farmelle, I have only met 2 other rogues in my time.  This is how it went...<br><br>1)  The Jinxy effect.  My first trip into the frontier for a quest item.  I had all but got back to Sauvage.  My blade turn was dropping.  I stopped to recast it.  Just as I moved off it dropped again (moving, no crit and blade turn can take it).  Simmy runs off behind me, then realm guards charge past.  One dead Lurkeen lying behind me.<br><br>The moral here?  I was too close to the realm guards.  They expected me to die straight off.  Didn't happen and simmy was on them so they couldn't restealth.  &quot;Less experienced caster.  Easy target for me to gak and get away.&quot;  Not so...<br><br>2)  In the Caledonia BG.  Solo popping Gobbos for exp while waiting for a group to get ready for an assault.  Just finished a fight and turned to run back to the PK about 50 yards away.  Another Lurkeen unstealths behind me and sticks me with poison and imbalance, then proceeds to hit me once and runs off.  I am poisoned to death.<br><br>This time, the boot was on the other foot.  I die, simmy dies, they get away.  Hats off to who ever it was as I didn't catch the name.  They didn't go for a one shot kill and it paied off for them.  I am even more impressed that they took on me of all people.  My pet is their bane as they can't restealth unless I die.<br><br>This highlights the fact that one shots are not necessarily the best way to go.  I am not defending Mithic's position on this, only highlighting that the changes are not necessarily crippling to the class.  (and I know that comment will get me flamed)<br><br>I believe in playing with what I have, not complaining about things till I get stuff I want.  e.g Cabalist pet heals.  Nice to have but in 1 on 1 in RvR I can take any class if they get distracted by the pet.  In PvE I used to have to heal the pet from my health, now I can chain kill yellows with NO down time thanks to that change.  I didn't ask for it but some people were unhappy and started to whine about it.  You can't make one class happy without pissing off the rest.  Balancing is a VERY fine issue and I should know as I write games for a living for the last 17 years (<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.sci.co.uk/games/conflict/desert_storm">www.sci.co.uk/games/conflict/desert_storm</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> shameless plug).  The way that Mithic are going about it is indicative of a company that has no real experience of writing games before.  Big changes, little testing.  They are missing the point.  Fix what's wrong, leave what's right and small tweaks to what lies between the two.  Polish makes the game better.  New features should be put in one at a time, look at the effects, tweak, adjust, then on to the next one.  Rogues aren't broken, they don't need fixing, tweaking maybe, but not fixing.<br><br>Their current system seems to be &quot;Oh, look, 100 people are crowing about this being an issue, they must be right.&quot;  Then there is me, sitting here thinking &quot;Look at all those moaning bastards!  Surprised they find the time to play.&quot;  Mark thread as read, fire up Camelot.<br><br>The bottom line isn't that they are nerfing Infs, Sorcs, yada, yada, yada...  Its that as a company they have very little experience of getting it right.  They will learn in time, but will Camelot survive their bumbling.<br><br>Paul Carpenter<br>Freelance Games Programmer (well, that all starts next week) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Wamba the Fool</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(5/15/02 8:38:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1130.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> my two cents</span><hr size=1> Gosh I love a good debate.<br>- The long and short of it is this.

RvR has become a group effort, in order for anyone to get rps and win the battle, it pretty damn important that the casters stay alive.  What i am trying to say is that you may have to change your tactics, or your role in rvr, and if infs just become guardians of the mighty casters and archer killers, it is still a far more important role then 70% of the classes have now.  <br><br>As far as one shot killing casters and newly rezzors being over, well it should. You think anyone likes getting killed by an even con person who invested the same amount of time in their toon as you did?  I do not play a caster or a stealther, but i have grouped with enough to tell ya this is not going to ruin anything at all for anyone cept for a few people who get off on getting 800  rp kills.<br><br>If we hunted in Odins or our own frontier more the 10 second restealth timer wouldn't even be an issue because of the places you can hide there.

I'll miss you! I wish you'd think on it at least another week before you quit outright but if not, hope to see you in another game down the road somewhere. <br><br>I think all you needed to say in your first post was Mez defines a Sorcerer and Stealth defines an Assassin and you pretty much point out whats wrong with DAOC in general. There are 2 really good classes in the game as a whole and a handfull of others that are good ,the rest stink.<br><br>Stealth was really handled badly in general. It's not stealth it's invisibility. My only real issues with it have/had been.<br><br>1. No one had counters to it. (i.e melees having detect ambush that does a /face when it goes off. Still doesn't make stealther visable just lets you know somethings up in that direction.)<br><br>2. It works when it shouldn't. If an hunter hits you and you see him and start whacking and he runs hits his speed burst how is it that he stealths when he is still in your line of sight?<br><br>If they were gonna spring this on you they should have offered a way for infs to escape similar to the hunter/ranger speed thing. I think non detected when killing was a bad idea to begin with but they should have offered something in return.<br><br>Stealth shouldn't solely Define an assassin class the amount of damage he can do to a target and his ability to escape should figure in as prominently.  Stealth should just be Just one tool of many that aid the assassin in his work.<br><br>I think the Game is essentially missing lots of utility spells that would make it more fun. Invis, detect invis, dispel magic. Basically as creepy said before it lacks counters. The Stungard mez strategy alone has made melee types useless in RvR(except Skalds) it never required the nerf it got just give a fair amount of classes dispel magic. Most times counters get called nerfs when they aren't in the mez instance it would be a nerf if you gave every class that can cast a spell a huge AE Dispel magic. If you give a single dispel to casters and healers and maybe give an AE to classes like Sorc,Spiritmaster and Enchanter it's not so big.<br><br>Well thats all the ranting I have in me for the day.

No matter what changes mythic makes good or bad someone is gonna be unhappy, no one can please everyone no matter what game all you can do is adapt to the changes they have made and there WILL be changes no online game can survive without them there is a reason that stealthers are usually the top RP earners on almost all the servers whether they be archers or rogues trying to kill someone u cant see is incredibly tough.  A friend of mine named Khaja is in my opinion the best Rogue on the server he is an excellent player and a great guy and he KNOWS how to play an INF ive seen him duel almost every class and won with the exception of beserkers and that is without stealth and before they gave rogues a boost.
