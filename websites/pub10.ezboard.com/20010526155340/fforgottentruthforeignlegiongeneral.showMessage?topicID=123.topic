I have the hots for this uber babe! Well listen to this! I just got back from a night out on the town with some friends from work. I'm pretty bad about attending these things ... just not the party monster type anymore. Believe me, back in my Air Force days I invented some drinking games and held a few parties that are still LEGANDARY in 7 coutries including the US. Ok, so we go to SunDance Square in Fort Worth. Probably one of the best and safest places in the metroplex to have fun. Kind of like Austin in atmosphere...big city with a small town feeling to it. There are bands playing on the rooftops ... in some of the side parks...lights everywhere ... horse drawn buggies cruising the square ... very safe and loads of fun!! If anyone every gets this way I'll take you on the town. Anyway, we head over to our favorite hangout &quot;Risky's&quot; a bar be que place with a live band. very cool, very fun. We know the staff and the singers. Of course everyone is busting my chops because I have been missing from the crowd for awhile. So, I'm haveing a few Shiner Bocks and in walks this woman. BOOM!!! If someone had hit me with a sledgehammer between the eyes I wouldn't have felt it. It was Alyssia Milano ... not. But it looked just like her. So anyway, I'm trying not to stare and act like half the other horn-dogs in the place when I catch her trying not to look at me. So, we end up playing this game of sneek a peek and look away. I'm not good with women anymore. Use to be ... but I just can't walk up and say hello. Besides which...Kimmy would kill me. So anyway, she's looking and smiling ... I'm looking and smiling and then Randy, the guy that does the singing starts trying to get my group up to sing. Now Julie, one of the trainers I work with, is a great singer. She belted out a few tunes. But then she passed the mic. It went around the tabel and people went up in ones and twos to sing. Well, for my punishment for missing all these party nights I had to go last and alone. Now I'm not a great singer, but I sure do know my Jimmy Buffet. So bolstered by my Shiner Bock I called for Jimmy's version of &quot;Brown Eyed Girl.&quot; I grabbed that mic, looked across the stage at that young lady and actually said &quot;This is for you.&quot; And boy did everyone I know looked shocked!!! Me singing but also singing to a total stranger. Well, I must have done a damn good job because at the end everyone was yelling and clapping and screaming and my Alyssia is standing up and clapping with them all. So I walked over and she gave me a hugh hug! This is so not like me but i was on a roll! So, we talked for hours. Her name is Lisa and she is a stand in / stunt double for Allysia Milano in real life!!!! I was floored!! She showed me pics and everything! Out in Los Colinas TX there are some movie studios where they shoot many scenes outside of Hollywood. RoboCop being one. She was out here working on some project that they had just finished. So we are talking like crazy and her friend, Mandy, is chugging one beer after another. I tell you what ... Lisa and i hit it off like you would not believe! Well, eventually, her friend was gonna do the techno-color yawn so Lisa took her to the ladies room. As I stood up and helped her get Mandy to her feet, Lisa put her hand behind my neck, pulled me down and kissed me on the cheek. She told me I better be there when she got back. Well...I'm on the moon now!! This woman was beautiful, talented, sexy and thought I was the best thing going. So, after letting my friends grill me...I head to the mens room. When I came back everyone is yelling quick...go outside...you'll miss her. Seems old mandy spewed all over herself and Lisa had to take her back to Los Colinas in a cab. About 60 miles from Ft Worth!! I missed her!!! she got away!! So now I am completely bummed out when Julie tells me she left her card for me and asked that i call her. So now, I'm begging everyone for the card and they won't fess it up. fianlly John, one of Julies friends said he had it and raised his schooner. The fricking card had been hidden under his beer mug ... but it wasn't there. The waitress had cleared the glasses and the card went with it!!!! So here i am...the woman of my dreams...or a damn good substitue...had walked out of my life! I feel like the biggest looser in the world!! What's even worse, I now know that I won't ever marry Kimmy. Not because of Lisa...not by a long shot. She is gone. But because I love Kimmy with all my heart...but not as a wife. Looks like I've got a lot of thinking to do. So, if you ever see a girl that looks like Alyssia Milano, answers to Lisa and lives in Boston ... tell her Rick is still singing her song.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#2f2f4f><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Wamba</FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Unregistered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>7/10/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>8:06:21 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=123.topic&index=1><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Reply</FONT></A></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">wow</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">What a story!<br>

Send her a dozen roses in care of the studio.  Attach a card, and tell her thanks for giving you something to dream about.  Sign it.<br>
Assuming that you have a listed phone number, perhaps she will look it up and call you, perhaps not.<br>
After a week, you can decide if you want to see her again.  Once again, the studio is your connection.  Leave your phone number for her.

Then again, my circle of friends includes remarkably few beautiful Hollywood actresses, so it's a long shot.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=95%><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT></TD><TD ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showMessage?topicID=132.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1><< Prev Topic</FONT></A> &nbsp;<A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showMessage?topicID=117.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Next Topic >></FONT></A> </TD></TR></TABLE><BR><TABLE WIDTH=95% BORDER=0><TR><TD><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=123.topic&index=2><IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/addReply1.gif border=0></A></TD><TD><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=123.topic><IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/images/email.gif BORDER=0 ALT="Email This To a Friend"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Email This To a Friend</FONT><BR><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.threadControl?topicID=123.topic><IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/deleteThreadFire.gif BORDER=0 ALT="Topic Control Image"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Topic Commands (Moderator only)</FONT><BR><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=123.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Subscribe</FONT></A>  <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Click to receive email notification of replies</FONT><BR><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=123.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Unsubscribe</FONT></A>  <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</FONT><BR></TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3 ALIGN=CENTER><BR><FORM ACTION=http://pub10.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum METHOD=POST><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Jump to: </FONT><SELECT NAME=forumName><OPTION VALUE=forgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral>General<OPTION VALUE=forgottentruthforeignlegionlinks>Links<OPTION VALUE=forgottentruthforeignlegionmembers>Members<OPTION VALUE=forgottentruthforeignlegionquotes>Quotes<OPTION VALUE=forgottentruthforeignlegionfrm4>Uber Loot</SELECT><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE=Go></FORM></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><CENTER><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>- </FONT><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bforgottentruthforeignlegion><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Forgotten Truth Foreign Legion</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0> - </FONT><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>General</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0> - </FONT><A HREF=http://ftfl.iwarp.com/index.html><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Home</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0> - </FONT></B></CENTER><P><BR><CENTER><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.free-irewards.com/cgi-bin/ezboard/games.html?id=ouuIcESe" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/banners/iRewards120x30-08.gif"></a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><IMG SRC="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/serve?bfmid=7279965&siteid=33932331&bfpage=expertc_tax" BORDER="0" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" NOSAVE >
