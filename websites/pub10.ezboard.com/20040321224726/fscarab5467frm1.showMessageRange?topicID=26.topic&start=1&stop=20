<br>
i was reading a guilds website just now and they have in place a bidding system, one which i really like........<br>
<br>
in short, you gain x points based on z different criteria (not important) and to claim loot you bid your points against everyone else who is bidding......<br>
<br>
example:<br>
a pally/sk 2hs drops, all pally's and sk's who want the wep are allowed to bid points on it......we will however set a minimum amount of points that an item can be won on, based on rarity (common drops 1 pt, uncommon 2 pts, rare 3 pts for example), just to limit the 'luck factor' when a class specific item drops and there is only 1 person of that class present :)<br>
<br>
so in this example lets say we have 2 pals and 1 SK present, they all want to bid for the wep, so the person in charge of bidding will tell the 3 how many points they have (that is, how many points each has will be made known to the 3 bidders), then they would each tell the 'bid-master' their bid, in points, for the weapon........the highest bidder wins, with ties resulting in /random<br>
<br>
<br>
this of course works well with distributing loot.......it doesnt however work so well when 'using' the scarab points system to enable you to recruit in scarab members for quest fights and such.......but i am sure some tweaking can be made.......for example just plain out giving your points to the people you recruit, like we currently have, or tweaking it somehow from there......<br>
<br>
what does everyone think about this?<br>
should we even have a system capable of 'recruiting' eachother for help on things? personally i am always willing to help regardless if you pay me points, and paying me points to come help wont make me come help anymore then without......but i thought it would be a very versatile function of our system to be able to do that when in need......maybe its not needed? i mean hey, goldy didnt have to pay us any points to break him out of seb......and nobody asked for points for the fist of fire fight even though those of us who got scales 'paid' out a point each anyway......i think things like this should still be rewarded though.....which, in a bidding system, would just mean that if someone helps more theyll have more points to bid on items? <p><HR>

I come to the raids for fun first of all, perhaps some xp and perhaps a nice drop.  The points are welcome as a reward for time spent, but are not a motivation for me to attend.  I would think this is probably true for many.<br>
<br>
We almost all have negative points at the moment so we can't bid on anything.  I started on -15, I think after a few weeks I am -9 now.<br>
<br>
If an items is nodrop we would need to know immediately how many points each person has, this is true in most ways of distributing items with points though.  <br>
<br>
It could lead to some very high points being spent.  For example, if Phinny drops BCS I would bid all my points, no question at all.  This forces some other wizard to bid one more than me, if they have the points to do so.  So while on a raid where an item is a quite difficult kill but always drops - like the fist of fire - the point cost is low, somewhere like Kedge and Phinny for epic pieces the point cost could be very high.  Also points for a particular item could vary a lot.  If only one wizard is present on a raid where the BCS drops, they can bid 1 point and get it, if two are present it could cost a very great deal of points.<br>
<br>
I would prefer fixed point cost, with the item going to the person present on the raid with the largest number of points (indicating that they had put most time in to scarab without taking anything out in terms of loot) that wants it and can use it (so not for MQ unless no one who can use it wants it), unless the raid was designed to get that item for a particular person.  This also requires that an accurate list of points is available of course. <p><p>

Better to have a fixed points on an item and random <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
1. I have similar doubts about the bidding system for the reasons mentioned already. Give loot a fixed 'price' and random if several people want it - that way, points still do matter and we avoid fluctuations in 'point costs' (see above).<br>
<br>
2. Make the point system as simple as possible and as complex as necessary. I know, I sound like a politician here, so let me elaborate. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  The current system appears to be rather 'complex' to me, in terms of following it on a raid. Things are often busy enough with organizing loot roles while fighting ... imagine you would have to keep track of a rather complicated point distribution system at the same time. So I agree with you, Mori, that we should not reallocate points everytime SCARAB is up to something. If I can, I will help a SCARAB member to do what he/she wants to do, regardless of points that I might get from it. After all, this is also supposed to grow into a community (a 'guildlike' organization) where you help the friends you made. &quot;'tis not all about the money (read: points)&quot; ... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  There should be something like points, however, to avoid people coming in just to get help and do nothing in return. So again, I prefer a rather simple system (that does not cover all possible constellations) that does not distract from playing and the 'community' idea ... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Has there been problems (ie complaints) about the current system?  The only (minor) one I have is that it's going to take some time to get rid my negative points based on my availability and the raid/fight rate atm. That is something I knew before joined up, just as I knew the system that is in place to get loot. A good loot system is a difficult one to set up and manage but I think the current one appears about as fair as you can get and gives everyone a chance. <br>
<br>
You mention setting a fixed number of points for a piece of loot and of players giving out points for help on raids. From what I see that's the system we have anyway. Changing it to a bidding system pushes the scales in favour of those who are fortunate to attend more raids. Whilst it is true that those people should be rewarded the current roll system should, by the law of averages, work favourably for those players anyway. A bidding system might cost membership - especially if players are limited to the times they can join in.<br>
<br>
One other consideration (sorry for the long post but I think it is important). What about mercenary recruitment? I have just had another look at the rules (Points System). <br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
A ranger needs help with the EK epic fight, so he recruits 2 full groups (minus himself) from SCARAB, the fight rewards everyone present with 1 point, however, since the only loot is in fact for the ranger himself, he must GIVE HIS/HER points to the group recruited. ie: if you recruit 11 SCARAB members to help you with a fight, you are required to pay the 11 points out from your own point pool in order to do this raid/fight. However, you must also pay for the loot claimed out of your own points pool as well, so in the end, for recruition of 11 SCARAB's, you will make a net loss of 11 points plus a few points depending on what quest item(s) were looted (which can be easily made back...but recruit wisely...you are of course able to recruit a mix of friends and SCARABs...think of SCARAB as a mercenary guild when recruiting for your own purposes: they want to be paid). Most quest items in this case will be 1-2 points. If a mob drops multiple copies of the same quest item and multiple people are present who wish to loot them, they must split the points pay-out to the recruited group, and each pay the point cost of the quest item looted.<br>
<br>
In addition, if there is dropped loot, the point value of this loot can be deducted from the points that the recruiting person needs to pay out, assuming of course that the loot is claimed by someone present instead of points (ie: if you also get an item worth 1 point which someone wants to claim instead of his/her point, you can award them this item instead of giving them your points. Another example: if an item worth 10 points is looted, someone can forfeit their 1 point plus 9 extra points from their points pool to claim it, and you will not have to pay their 1 point for the fight. All loot from these fights is claimed by the person paying out the points.)<br>
(end quote)<br>
<br>
How will this be handled? Having players bid may mean the recruiting player may pay very heavily if the bidding is fierce. If we are saying just a fixed number of points is deducted then this makes it unfair to those that have had to bid for the item on previous occasions.<br>
<br>
<br>
I agree that there is always room for improvement but as I said at the beginning, if it aint broke, dont fix it  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

i type too damn much.......nothing i can do about it......sorry ;)<br>
<br>
well first i must give a huge thank you to all the feedback, some very interesting and valuable points made all across......<br>
<br>
i just wanted to clear up some misconceptions and/or things that werent clear, possibly, with the original system that have thus led to alot of unwarranted negative thoughts about this bidding system proposal.......<br>
<br>
<br>
ambrielle first:<br>
-point about the phinny drop.  right, so theres more then 1 wiz or druid there to fight over it...however, even with our current system, in a phinny type hit, it is most likely someone who organized it that wants the drop, and regardless of points, the person organizing it will get it.......in this type of thing, the person organizing will use our still-yet-to-be-used 'mercenary' type 'recruiting' to get the members he/she needs for the hit to be made.......(ideally we would all just go help and etc but paying someone a point to come help was an idea i had that could just expand on the uses of scarab points).....<br>
-the problem with fixed loot point values is simple, and we have already encountered this problem a few times...that problem is quite simply that it is impossible to go and pre-assign point values to all the loot in the game......i mean cmon, of the 50k+ items that exist in the game, at least 10% of that would be loot we would possibly encounter and roll for, lets say, but that still leaves a huge number of items to go and set pricetags on......and who gets to say what those prices are?  also, as we have already seen, price tagging items is ultimately unfair, in the strictist sense, because we dont always know the rarity, the rarity may change, the value of the item itself may change, and i could go on about hundreds of different factors as to why setting a fixed value on something is in fact quite bad........(nothing in EQ has a fixed price, so trying to set a fixed price in points is sortof futile......a brood axe 6 months ago sold for 10k.......if one dropped today is someone still going to pay 10 points for it? doubtful, in fact, impossible.....)<br>
this forecasting of mine is primarily why i dont like my own system.......originally i had intended it to be a loose system that could change from raid to raid, but as we started getting some complaints about 'oh but he only paid 2 points for that last raid why do i have to pay 3?' (or vice versa) the quickest solution was to just say "ok, fixed points, sorry".......i should have thought more thoroughly and not said that but i did so whats done is done......<br>
<br>
iilea, you also made the same point as ambrielle did about items not having the same prices in a bidding system at different times....this i have addressed above, in the fact that our points system was originally intended to be the exact same way........base item prices based on what they currently selling for in bazaar (average of all prices or something fair thereabouts) was what the system was intended to do, so prices were never intended to be fixed, and if you agree with my point above about the brood axe ;) you will also thereby agree that prices should in fact NOT be fixed......<br>
being there at the right time is always going to be a factor in EQ......i know that now for damn sure after camping this bloody white chicken stormfeather for over 45 hours since sunday........however this factor, in a 'fair' system, *should* be minimized......<br>
<br>
so i propose an addition to the bidding system:<br>
<br>
the thing i want to propose to fix the issue about someone bidding all their points on phinny drop or some such versus someone bidding only the minimum points because they are the only one there for the class is that we could assign point values to items based on rarity......<br>
now comparing phinny to fist of fire isnt exactly a comparison ;) fist of fire can be auto-spawned every 15 minutes and phinny can take a week to spawn in the bottom of a zone only truly accessable with a good invis and EB item......<br>
assigning points to an item based on rarity, we could assign them on a range of 1 to 6 points......that is, 6 points would be *the* uber item in *the* uber zone that alot of ppl are going to want to bid on......now the thing that will hopefully fix the "he paid 10 points for his and i only paid 1 for mine" is that the MAXIMUM amount of points one would be allowed to bid on an item, is its 'rarity' value times 2.......thus, if an item dropped with a rarity value of 6 (the highest), you could bid 12 points on it maximum, and sure, even if there are multiple ppl bidding max points, it can still be resolved via the ML rolling.....this would mean that, say, some chain quest pants or boots or whatever dropped in kael and 3 ppl want it, for examples sake lets say it has a rarity value of 2, so they could all bid up to 4 points.......now, lets say theres only 1 person who is chain class present (not likely, but lets just say), he/she obviously wants to bid lowest and get em cheap - ie 2 points - is that such a big threat to the person who paid 4 points during the last raid? personally, ill say this now, i dont give a damn if im on every raid that is full of monks (or whatever im playing) which cause me to pay double in this kind of a system every single time.....thats fine with me, because ill eventually get some of the neat gear i want and if i have to help out twice as much as some other monk to get it then so be it, things are actually alot worse for me now anyway ;)<br>
<br>
im rambling now i know but i hope i made some points clear.....<br>
the system we have *is* in a sense broken, it just hasnt broken yet ;) but i can pretty much predict that it will, and will cause alot of unhappiness and i want to avoid that.....im good at predicting the future in this way, dont believe me if you dont want to but if you know me at all you will, because ive proven it to you sometime or another ;)<br>
<br>
i also reviewed another system that another guild uses which is quite simple and, as far as my inquiries, works quite OK:<br>
you get 1, 2 or 3 points per raid based on a predetermined 'size' and 'time' the raid requires, you then claim loot by resetting your raid points back to 0......which basically means you can only get 1 piece of loot per raid because you cant claim a second piece after already setting points to 0 ;) in the case that "nobody else" is around to loot something that "obviously" you are going to get most use out of, yet you have already looted something, and (for this example) lets say they are both ND items, you can then forfiet your next raids points for it.....<br>
now when claiming loot this way, the highest points gets first dibs, so the person that hasnt gotten loot for awhile will end up getting the item he/she wants......but the flip side to this is that, as some of the above posts have said is bad, that 'timing is everything'.....what if youre the lucky guy that goes on a raid time and time again only having points from your previous raid and continually claiming loot because nobody else of your class is around?<br>
<br>
to that i have but one thing to say: well in that case youre a lucky one and no points system in the world is going to stop you ;) and in all reality, thats just the way it is.......and personally, as ive already said, i dont give a damn and i am in fact quite happy for someone else who gets something more easily then me ;) im not a person that groans when someone else gets a loot item i want, im a person that claps and says 'whoa wtg man thats awesome!' and i have a big grin on my face thats just as big as it would be if i were the one to get it......hrmmm, maybe im wierd? too bad if i am, because then the rest of ye can goto hell ;)<br>
<br>
(and for those who dont know me, i have a sick sense of humor where i like to make fun of our stupid humanly downfalls......so dont take anything too seriously.....words to live by ;)<br>
<br>
SUMMARY:<br>
<br>
complaints of bidding system:<br>
-loots wont have 'fixed' point values, due to "being at the right raid at the right time" problem<br>
-a few think our current sysytem is not broken so why change it ;)<br>
<br>
my answers:<br>
-giving loots all a rarity value between 1 and 6, or whatever, and then having the MAXIMUM allowed points payable for claiming something be the rarity value (1 through 6) times 2...any discrepencies thereof being rolled over<br>
-it would then be RAIDS which would have fixed point values...each would be given points roughly according to the time/size of groups required to do the raid.....<br>
-our current system if in fact quite flawed and doomed to fail because of 2 things: we CANT keep fixed point values on items because prices and value of items in EQ change daily, and because we also CANT go and pre-assign point values to 50,000 game items.......<br>
<br>
another totally different system would be to have a system, briefly explained, where:<br>
-points would be awarded, for example 1/2/3 points for each raid based on the raids time/size required<br>
-to claim loot you would reset your points to 0, thus in this kind of system, the more effort you put forward means the more possibility you have of getting that *uber drop* when it drops because youll have more points then anyone else wanting to claim it......that is, the person with highest points gets the loot, rolling randomly between discrepencies.....you would not bid in this system, and this system has a much higher chance of people paying wildly different amounts of points for the same item (due to the 'being at the right place at the right time factor') but in all honesty it is 100% fair because it is up to the person whether he/she wants to raid places just to stockpile points, or claim loot......either of which will ultimately reward the player...<br>
-in this system all of us will be reset to 0 points, and given points based on who HASNT looted from the raids already done by scarab......this would also happen with the bidding system<br>
-in order to request help for a quest hit or whatnot, the people attending the raid/group/etc for the mob hit will get points according to the same rules that regular raids get, yet it will be first dibs for the organizing person to loot the quest drop thus resetting his/her points.....this is a much less complex and a very smooth way to request help with quest stuff and will no doubt encourage everyone to setup raids to do their quest stuff (which is what we want, no?).....in short: the attendees will get easy points by helping another member with a quest, and the person doing the quest will get his/her drop<br>

scarab is a group where anyone can start a raid......we have no designated RLs or leaders or anything like that.......if you want to raid a zone, get some discussion going and start one up....if you dont know enough to RL, find someone who does.....<br>
<br>
this group will be as much as you make out of it, but nothing more.......so far its been a blast to me even though im caught in a struggle between keeping myself up in school and being able to play as much EQ as i want ;) (read: as much as my bloody addiction requires me to)<br>
<br>
so with a bidding or point wipe system, it will reward those players even moreso who take initiative and raid the zones they want loot from.......and i think this reward in itself is worth it for people to organize raids......<br>
<br>
in fact im going to throw another idea up here: if you organize a raid, you get to reserve 1 item that might possibly drop.....we can tweak this to ensure that someone with only 1 pt cant always go farm COF's from naggy (can say for example that to reserve an item you have to have minimum X amount of points or something......or base the X amount of points on how many points the raid gives, etc)<br>
this would encourage more initiave in the group to actually get things going.......but i think its quite fair, since we already have in place a system that rewards RLs for their extra effort..... <p><HR>

I was surprised it was suggested in the first place and happy to go along with it to see how it would turn out.<br>
<br>
Ultimately the fairest loot system is that suggested above where once you loot something it resets your points to date back to zero. If you dont loot then you get points (set by pre-determined rules).<br>
<br>
This loot system works well where all the players have a fairly good level of equipment already. It kind of works less well when a new player with not so good equipment joins. In this instance they pick up more kit quickly, the balance being that they need it more. The really good stuff still goes to the players with better kit (as they have more points through not spending it). As long as people who agree to this system are aware of this then no problems I guess.<br>
<br>
Another question to ask of this loot system is the ability to loot anything. So if a really nice Paladin item drops (and it is NOT nodrop) and you are on the raid as your Enchanter do you still get the ability to request the loot. My answer to this is yes as Scarab is about rewarding the effort put in by the player and not the character. So if we apply this system then we are not applying the NBG way of doing things, lets just be clear about this.<br>
<br>
Multiple claims. If 2 items drop in a raid and you are the only person to want both can you get them, answer is yes. The first claim takes you back to zero pts. The second takes the pts from your next raid.<br>
<br>
Unclaimed loot. My opinion on unclaimed loot is that anyone in the raid should have 2 days from the end of the raid to make a request for the loot. To be eligible they must have had positive points at the end of the raid in which the item drops (no building up points on the next raid and then claiming it). After this point the item becomes open for anyone else to claim (within the next 7 days). At the end of the 7 day period the person who wants it with the highest points gets it (and their pts reset to zero). After this the item either gets sold (mony to Scarab funds) or remains open for claim (first person to claim gets it). <br>
<br>
How to apply this to the 'mercenary' raid. Hmmmm<br>
<br>
I guess you could apply some of the same rules, the person organising the raid gives up points to all the people hired to help. They are either reset to zero or possibly allowed to go negative (to a preset level). If anyone on the raid selects any other loot then the raid organiser does not need to give them anything (maybe bringing them less negative but never above zero), and the person who loots points is set to zero again.<br>
<br>
E.g. Person A has 10 points and organises a raid to get object Z. He recruits 7 people to help at a cost of 2 pts each. If only he loots on the raid then he gets a points total of -4 at the end (and has to do the next couple of raids with no chance of loot). If, however, 3 players loot other items on his raid then his end total is reset to 0 (10 minus 8 is above 0 and therefore reset to 0). The 3 players who looted get reset to 0, the remaining 4 players get the 2pts each added to their totals.<br>

<br>
1. I agree current system is not sustainable - there's too much loot to agree fixed prices<br>
<br>
2. Resetting points to zero. I don't think I like this. I might have been saving points for a while and got enough where, if say a BP dropped in Kael I could be pretty sure to get it. But then something like a helm drops. Its nice, I'd like it - but its not worth my huge stack of points. Say I got 20 points, and another guy wants it and has 3 points. Well, I'd be happy to spend 5 points on it, but with this system its either 20 or nothing.<br>
<br>
3. Bidding. I like this idea, with a rarity value setting a maximum bid price. I believe drops on a raid should always go to those who are present first, and only go to alts or others who weren't there if nobody wants. I'd therefore be against any minimum system, if you are there and are the only one  who wants an item I think you should get it and that's that. If you are the only one who wants it, then either a) everyone else has better stuff already or b) you are probably the only one in your class on the raid and are quite possibly essential to the raids success. c) maybe you are just a lucky bastard <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
4. Negative points. I like the rule that you can't loot while on negative points - but with almost everyone in this situation at the moment I think we have to either <br>
a) set the more active, helpful members to zero points (could cause controversy though!) <br>
b) set everyone to -5 points and then add on any points won/lost so far.<br>
<br>
4. Leading raids. Very few people lead raids at the moment so I think this needs rewarding. I'd suggest letting raid leaders have a &quot;joker&quot; card to play, whereby they automatically win one item of loot, which they can choose to play at any time on the raid. Of course they never know what will drop later so its gonna be fun to see them use it on some ok item and then have an uber item drop next minute - or wait for that uber item only for it never to drop! But I think that's half the fun <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
5. Mercenary system. Not sure how this works with the above system for the raid leader, and we have to consider that sometimes the person wanting the raid will lead it, and other times someone else might lead it. I'd like to think we are all friends and would help out anyway <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but I appreciate that a more substantial form of motivation can help.<br>
<br>
<br>
Finally I think that, so far, everything has worked out well. A few of us have got some kael armour, but more importantly I've made a bunch of new friends and had some good fun, as well as getting to know a new zone or two (Naggy's lair, The Grey, Kael). A big thanks to all involved, especially the organisers. <p><table>

Thustump<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  i think we will still having the NBG system. As first only players who needs the item dripping should be able to claim it. and if there are none who needs it and will use it, then it can go to the rest that want for other purposes.<br>
well, one of the purposes of the &quot;zero&quot; system is that each time you loot you return to zero. And then you wont (hopefully) ro be able to stack up 20 points or more<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  if you do then it is more sure you will get the item that dropps when you need it<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and that aint bad.... but i have to agree it sucks to loose all 20 points if it is only a minor upgrade<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but that is the way it is<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
We could also keep two different systems. As mecenary and raid systems are different.

<br>
hold the phone.......<br>
<br>
the concept presented here was much less complex and quite simple really compared to all the misunderstandings posted below it (although, on retrospect, new ideas and hindsight has come of those misunderstandings......so im glad for it in the end;)<br>
<br>
lemme explain as simple as i can.....<br>
<br>
THE POINT WIPE SYSTEM (zero point system, whatever you wanna call it)<br>
<br>
-when you want a loot item, you are allowed to take it IF:<br>
--you have positive points<br>
--you are part of the raid<br>
--you are willing to reset your points to 0 for the loot item<br>
--you have more points then anyone else wanting to claim it<br>
(ties between points etc solved with random)<br>
<br>
-looting more then 1 item at the same raid is unallowed, unless the following conditions are true:<br>
--everyone present passes on the item<br>
--you are part of the raid<br>
--you are willing to gain NO points during the next TWO consecutive raids (effectively giving yourself -2 raid points)<br>
<br>
-unclaimed items as part of a raid will be given X days to be claimed by the players who were part of said raid, thereby after allowing the unclaimed items to be claimed by anyone in SCARAB using the same loot rules as if they were at the raid themselves...<br>
eg: lets say our limit is set to 3 days? so after 3 days, the loot obtained on a raid is open to all of scarab, and in order to claim any of the loot they must reset points to 0, etc.etc. claiming a second item also applies the second item loot rule<br>
<br>
<br>
this is the most simple form for this system......why i believe it is better to have a second looted item make the player sacrifice the points from the next TWO raids is simple: otherwise a player could get 2 loot items first raid, and just continually sacrifice the points from the next raid everytime.....and i am quite certain that there wont be enough loot to allow everyone to go home with something new, on every raid......so sacrificing the next 2 raid points will allow the player to get that second item that they *REALLY* want, but it will cost them possibly more then if they had spent just their 1 RP on 1 item...this also means, of course, that during the next raid, this player will not be allowed to loot at all, because he/she will fail condition #1 for being allowed to loot items (which is: having positive points)<br>
<br>
the 'mercenary' aspect with this system is what is really neat......'mercenary' events, ie: where someone needs help with some quest hit or whatnot, count as if they were just a normal raid, with merely 1 special rule in place:<br>
the person organizing the raid for his/her item gets to reserve that item, obviously, but also gets no points for the raid, AND resets points to zero after aquiring the item (or when the raid is finished - success or not.  we can discuss this later but lets keep things simple for now.)<br>
<br>
so basically in these 'mercenary' (eg: epic fights, etc) events, it will just serve, practically, as a way for scarab members to either 'work off' negative points, or stockpile on points to ensure that when the next big raid in XXX goes down that they can get their ZZZ item......<br>
<br>
everyone with me so far?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BIDDING SYSTEM<br>
this system will be harder to implement. for the sole reason that we will once again have to, in order to evade the "someone paying 1 for an item and another person paying 20 for the same item another day" problem, itemize loot and assign values to it (in this case: "rarity" values)...so we run into the same problem once again, but on a chopped down much smaller scale (alot easier to on-the-fly come to some sort of agreement as to how rare and 'valuable' items are if everything in the game is worth between 1 and 5, lets say).<br>
<br>
-in this system you would be rewarded 1, 2, or 3 points based on the size and difficulty of the raid (can expand this to rewarding 1 through 6 to enable a more diverse spread of raids, but thats a question of aesthetics, lets keep it simple for explanation sake;)<br>
-you would use the points you have stockpiled to 'bid' on items as they drop......same rules apply, you must have positive points, be on the actual raid, etc.<br>
-with this system you would, realistically, be able to loot any number of items per raid, as long as you still have points to bid.....this can be seen as a bad thing but also as a good thing (maybe youve gone on 20 raids and nothing has ever dropped for you, or youve just always lost bid)<br>
-when, however, opening up unclaimed items to the rest of scarab in a system like this........i dont even want to try to come up with a way for the people to bid over unclaimed items then because it would no doubt be a nightmare ;) however for sake of being thorough, lets just say everyone who wants to claim an item would email me or whomever (ML maybe?) with the item they want to claim and their bid in points......this would keep things annonymous enough, i suppose ;)<br>
<br>
when dealing with the 'mercenary' issue with this system, it gets, imo, out of concept........unless we were to count it as a regular raid as in the system above, but then we would of course need to assign point values to the item that would be obtained by the person organizing......so they cant just always pay 1.....but simple fights/raids should have different values then complex ones.....eg: killing eejag versus killing innoruuk......this draws us once again back to the problem of having to assign point values for everything.....something we really cant do (but might be able to work around, i dunno)<br>
<br>
<br>
after my own review of my own proposals.....this is what i think:<br>
i think it is very unique and gives a very powerful tool to everyone in scarab to be able to 'use eachother' to accomplish quests and raids and what-ever-it-is-they-are-after......thus was the invention of this whole 'mercenary' idea.....and it seems like most people like it, and in fact we've already used it a good few times and been rather successful...this concept of being able to 'use' your fellow scarab members and in return rewarding them somehow according to the system we all agree by, would be most fluid and seamless in the point wipe system......<br>
thus i obviously would lean in favor of the point wipe system.....but merely being able to use this mercenary aspect is not enough, in my oppinion, for us to use a system.....we must first use a system that is solid and will be fair in 9 out of 10 (or hopefully even 99 out of 100) situations to all involved......i think this point wipe system does this as well, WITH ONE CONDITION: players will themselves be responsible for either organizing, helping to organize, helping to motivate, or in some way shape or form, getting other SCARABs to raid the zones that they wont to raid in order to get the items they wish to get.....if a player takes no initiative in scarab under this system whatsoever, it is quite possible that said player will never raid a zone where his/her class has the drops that he/she wants.......<br>
this however, i view as a very POSITIVE aspect of this system...why? because SCARAB in its entire concept after being 'remade' is that its members MUST take initiative, and MUST be active in order to achieve anything in the group......thus, i think this system will not only encourage MORE player participation, but it will encourage our entire goal of not having to worry so damn much about points, and just going out and having fun together and helping eachother get the stuff we want.........<br>
<br>
scenario:<br>
someone wants to get some armor drops in tov for kael MQs, sets up a 3 group raid, lots of armor is gotten, not for everyone, lets say they were doing the plate hall and just got lots of plate stuff, those that were present and DIDNT get some stuff will 1)get points 2)will have helped at minimum 1 other person get what he/she desired (and this effect works in a circle) and 3)will have the opportunity to get MQ loots for themselves if they in fact want some of the drops (in the case that they cant use the item dropped, they can still cash in points to claim it), or they can just stockpile the points for another time to ensure that they get something they are really after<br>
<br>
its going to be a win win situation for everyone......sure, there will be times when you stockpile alot of points and blow it all on something stupid.....but then there will also be times when you have 0 points, go on a raid, and spend that very raids point on something gotten from the raid itself......<br>
we could even eventually implement some sort of limit to how many points can be taken away when claiming an item......ie: cant loose more then 10 points when claiming an item, or maybe 7 points, or 8, or whatever (would depend on how points are awarded of course)......thus we would have taken care of the problem of the person that goes and helps on 20+ raids, never getting loot, and then finally when something drops that he/she wants, the player finally cashes in for it......having first dibs on any item of your choice will just have to be the reward for having to pay extra points to get it, for those who tend to stockpile points rather then spend them......i mean, think about it......it has a serious novelity to it...........going on a raid and KNOWING that if XXX item drops, its yours........and if not this time then next time......i think that would be reward in itself, and the ultimate goal anyway: helping the group out enough so that when 'your' item drops, you are 'respected' enough to get first grabs at it.....<br>
<br>
overall i think this point wipe system can give this group alot of motivation.....because using it and organizing raids and groups and whatnot is going to be rewarding for everyone<br>
<br>
anything unclear? ;)) <p><HR>

I've been looking at a range of raid point systems for a while, some are really complex e.g. where specific items have values and they need to keep a database of all the items and points etc.  Others are less complicated, e.g. get 1 point per raid, when you chose an item you lose all the points.<br>
<br>
From what I can gather the system needs to meet the following objectives: - <br>
<br>
1. Fair and recognises Effort.<br>
The system has to be fair so that people feel comfortable attending raids by knowing that the effort / reward ratio is balanced.<br>
<br>
2. Easy to manage.<br>
The system has to be as simple as possible so it's easy to manage and keep upto date.  The correct reporting channels for SCARAB raids needs to be set-up and maintained.<br>
<br>
3. Flexible<br>
The system has to be flexible enough to be applicable from the small epic encounter to the large dungeon crawl.<br>
<br>
With these objectives in mind there are a number of key rules which should be static no matter what form of point system is applied.<br>
<br>
1. Whenever an item (drop or no drop) is looted by guild member (main or alt), points are deducted.<br>
<br>
2. The system is Need Before Greed (NBG).  For example if CoF drops from Naggy, Uber_Wiz with 50 points cannot bid for the item unless there is no class available who wants the item.<br>
<br>
3. Items that go unclaimed can be looted by the guild banker and buyers can spend points at a later date on said items.<br>
<br>
Again with these criteria in place there are a number of other factors that go into making a fair raid.  I would suggest that we should assume that every player attending a raid should reasonably expect to be able to loot one item each.  This needs a little explaining.  Basically if Player_A goes on a raid he can fall into one of three criteria: <br>
<br>
1. He doesn't loot anything.  Therefore he should be credited with points for the next raid.<br>
2. He loots one item.  His point credit should be only changed (marginally), unchanged if he loots an average value item (I'll get on to this later).<br>
3.  He loots more than one item.  His point credit should be lowered. (if he loots average items)<br>
<br>
The point system I would propose is as follows: -<br>
<br>
2 Points for being at the raid from start to end.<br>
1 Point for arriving late or leaving early.<br>
1 Additional point per hour for anything over 3 hours.<br>
<br>
It is the job of the raid leader to keep track of point gains or his appointed deputy.<br>
<br>
The cost of items can fall into 4 categories, it is the job of the Master Looter (ML) / RL to decide on the value of the item.<br>
<br>
1 point - An item that provides marginal improvement and can be upgraded relatively easily. e.g. Plane class gloves or boots.<br>
<br>
2 points - An item that provides an improvement to the class and may be recognised for its ability in certain situations.  e.g. Plane class BP, Legs; Kael Quest Gloves, Boots etc.<br>
<br>
4 points - An item that provides a significant improvement to the class and is recognised as standard equipment for a level 55 - 60 character. e.g. HoT Quest BP, Legs.  Kael Quests BP, Legs etc.<br>
<br>
8 points - An item that is a class defining piece of equipment that is recognised as an excellent piece of equipment for level 55-60.  e.g. CoF, Mosquito Leg Earring, basically anything that is worth 50Kpp upwards.<br>
<br>
When an item drops the ML will announce the item link and point cost in the raid channel.  All those interested who are of the correct class and the correct number of points will send tells to the ML.  The person with the highest point credit will be awarded the item.  The point rating for the item will be deducted from the persons points.  In the event that no person has enough points, the person with the highest number of points claiming the item will be allowed to go into negative points.  However, once in negative points they will not be able to claim an item.<br>
<br>
If we assume that an initiate (like me) should attend 3 raids to assertain their quality, they should be started on -6 points.  Therefore once they have attended 3 raids on time and stayed all the way through they will then start to accumulate positive credit.<br>
<br>
An epic encounter should be treated as a 2-4 point item depending on the nature of the encounter, i.e. the time to complete.  Those attending should be credited 2 points.  (To encourage completion of epics).<br>
<br>
Hope this is useful,<br>
Cheers,<br>
Deslok.<br>

i couldnt agree with you more, but this is pretty obvious ;)<br>
you forgot one thing though<br>
4. a system that is unabusable<br>
that is, a system that cannot be abused by 'farming points', getting items for less, getting more privelages then earned, etc.<br>
<br>

<br>
once again, couldnt agree with you more, this is what we've been striving for in all the points systems we've been testing/discussing........it is however very nice that you summed up what needs to be done, so that we dont loose track, and dont sway off course...i think in our discussions of points systems, we have lost track of what the ultimate goal is......your post will be an immense help on 'putting us straight' again......however.......<br>
you then go on to explain a system, that is not simple, quite complex, and breaks our rule #1 when we are trying to put together a valid points system:<br>
<br>
rule #1: we cannot have point values for items, in anyway shape or form...value of items in EQ changes, and thus must the points deducted for an item when claimed be variant...before kunark, according to your system, a PoH/PoF piece of armor would cost 8 points, without argument...it was simply the uberest stuff in the game (armor? that gives STATS???? youre kidding me!!!).  i wouldnt pay more then a point, and in most cases not even that for old-world planes armor now. thus, simply put, we cannot apply any scarab points in any shape or form, to EQ items...it wont work<br>
<br>
your system also breaks your own rules on keeping things simple, not completely, but it still does.......it does this by introducing situation-dependant variables, and in the case that RL/ML decides what an item is worth in points, it also introduces a huge complexity called human oppinion ;)<br>
<br>
your system also breaks rule #2 for our 'points system creation excercise':<br>
rule #2: we cannot allow to reward more points, especially in a point-per-item-value deduction system, then we gain loot...if we reward more points then we have loot to claim, everyone will rack up tons of extra points, and they wont mean anything...it will be the ultimate form of inflation...very easy to make points, nothing to spend em on.....<br>
<br>
your system is concise and in principle simple, but suffice to say, it 'just wont work', not the way you want it to anyway ;)<br>
<br>
the only way a system will work, i say again, is if it ties no relation to WHICH item is looted.....that is, the amount of points deducted for looting an item, is independant from which item it is.....the point wipe system, imo, does this the best, and is also the best way to allow our previous 'mercenary recruitment' idea about scarab completely seamlessly......the bidding system takes care of all the above issues the same as the point wipe system, however, recruiting help from scarab's to help you when you need it, would require another add-on system just for that...because bidding for your reserved epic item isnt exactly feasible...youre always going to bid 1, and sure we can put some limitations in place, but then we are drifting towards breaking our rule #1 which states, clearly, that we cannot place point restrictions/values on eq item values.....<br>
<br>
<br>
i think the best system we are going to get, and in fact the most simple one, is the point wipe system......implemented simply first, and we can tweak it along the way (ie:how we reward points based on what zones are raided/time invested etc)<br>
<br>
<br>
--------POINT WIPE SYSTEM------------<br>
1)attending a raid gets you 1 point, coming on time, and staying through the entire thing, gets you another 1 point.  those that leave, go LD, come late, or leave early will only recieve their 1 point if the RL says they do.....this will hopefully disallow any abuse of ppl running from raid to raid, staying 5 minutes, getting their point, and leaving.....we can also thus say, that if you are on a raid, you are not allowed to get points for any other raid if it overlaps with the raid you are trying to get points on (ie: we have 2 planes raids, at the same time, or overlapping eachother in some way...you can only get points, regardless if you attend both partially, for 1 of the raids)<br>
<br>
2)to claim loot, you must have positive points, from previous raids (not the current one), and be willing to erase all of those points to zero in order to claim the loot item.....if you have over 10 points, looting an item will cost you a flat out 10....ive thought of having a variant system, that divides your points in half, or takes a percentage, etc. but it will not work in all situations.....if you are unfortunate enough to have been on many many raids and yet never had the chance to loot something you want, and have thus racked up a good deal of points, looting your next item or two might cost you alot (ie: 10 points) but it wont wipe you to 0.......it will also allow you to loot multiple items on the same raid, as long as you have positive points......10 points is equivalent, in most situations, to 4 or 5 raids.......so its not that whole heck of alot of points ;) i hope this sytem wont be too 'rewarding' and thus break our rule #2, but lets try it and find out i always say :)<br>
<br>
3)this is really part of #2, but will make another rule merely to clarify HOW looting works:<br>
first of all, when something is looted, it is NBG.....ideally only the classes who can use the item can claim it.....in the case of all/all items or items (like a shield usable by a ranger) that are obviously not 'for' a certain class, the most appropriate classes that would most practically use the item will be the ones allowed to claim it.  after which classes are allowed to claim an item is confirmed, those present who wish to claim it will send a tell, or say out loud in the raid channel that they wish to claim the item.  the person with the highest points wins, if there is a tie, it is randomed between the players that are tied.  no points are lost for loosing a random ;) only for looting an item.<br>
<br>
4)as far as recruiting scarabs to do your dirty work :)<br>
recruiting scarab's for quest raids/epic raids/etc is very simple: it counts as a regular raid.....yet the drop item is reserved, and will require you to set your points to zero.....in order to make this function unabusable, the following conditions will apply:<br>
a)the amount of groups present, times two, is the minimum amount of points you must have, or be willing to "pay" in order to reserve your item, and call in a quest raid for your item......if there are multiple people who will loot a quest item (eg: the mob drops 2 of them, like VS does, etc) then they will, commutatively, be required to have an amount of points equal or greater to the amount of groups required to do the raid, times two........<br>
example: eejag hit generally requires 1 uber group, or 2 regular groups......since we arent all lvl 60s, it would be most common for it to require 2 groups....so if you want to do this fight, and you are the only monk who is going to get the scale, 2 groups times 2 would be 4 points, thus said, you must have a minimum of 4 points in order to call in this raid.....everyone present will be awarded their regular raid points as if it was a regular 2 group raid........if 2 monks were going to get the scale, then EACH monk must have a minimum of 2 points.....1 monk cant have all 4 points, or 3 points, and the other have 0 or 1......in the case that one monk might pay more then the other, tough luck, thats too bad......in this scenario, the monk(s) looting the scale would be reset to 0, and would recieve no points for the raid (raid points are awarded at the END of a raid after all loot is claimed....keep in mind #1, where it says you must have positive points from a previous raid in order to claim loot)<br>
<br>
5)unclaimed loot will be banked, i suggest we have 3 bank chars all on different accts owned by different ppl, each bank char will specialize in a certain type of loot: 1)gems/quest items 2)your common equipment loot 3)pp, coffins, peris, runes/words/pages, and everything else.......<br>
the gems/quest items char will probably be my druid, which i will be PLing to 24 (is 17 now) so that i can bring him along and camp him outside of any zone we are raiding (or at the zone line) and then come and loot any non claimed ND items, which i can then quite easily MQ later since the druid will of course be able to TP anywhere.  either that or i could use my druid on my 2nd acct who is already 30 and just two-box him (soon as i buy another comp, which should be sometime this month) and that would take care of that :)<br>
i believe runemoon has a mule setup for scarab, and lildariel or whoever else it was that had gotten tons of loot and didnt have room for it......<br>
<br>
these 5 'rules' outline the entire system........everything should be clear, but since im generally not so good at keeping things that way, ask questions for anything that isnt ;)<br>
<br>
unless there is a major disagreement with this rule system, it will soon be put in place........now is your time to speak up or forever hold your peace ;) <p><HR>

<br>
My sole suggestion after reading it is the points that existing members have are changed.  As it is almost no-one can claim any loot at the moment and will not be able to for some time to come.  Resetting the starting point to (for example) -5 or zero instead of -15 would resolve this.

<br>
the old system required us, realistically, to start new members out at -15......merely because we COULD NOT allow the total points be more then the loot we have gotten......if we did, the system would crash.......<br>
better to fix it before it breaks ;)<br>
<br>
the point wipe system would put everyone, actually, just at 0......<br>
however you wont gain points until youre on the full members list, which will require 3 raids......which is back to the original intent of what our rules said to begin with ;)<br>
<br>
we are quite lenient of course with putting people on the members list before 3 raids.....all it takes really is to show your participation and commitment to the group to become a 'full member' (you already are lild).....<br>
<br>
so anyway, putting in this new system would wipe everyones points to zero.....must be a member (read: not still an 'initiate') prior to a raid to recieve raid points however.....and any loot thus far recieved we can sortof 'sum out' and bank it......if thats ok with everyone ;) <p><HR>

Would then this person loose 10 RP just for taking it so it wont rot? Or is it possible with exeptions in cases like this?<br>

<br>
the answer is, i dunno.......<br>
we cant have ppl going on raids and just saying "nah i dont want it" just because it might be a class item and nobody else is around to take it, and then get it anyway without spending points.....but we sure as hell dont want to be the kind of group that lets good loot rot.....i think ive made my personal oppinion and attitude clear about this: i hate to see things go to waste.....(thats why i have 4 trade satchels full of newbie old-world junk for sale, lol)<br>
so, i think, just in general, that the best way to handle this is that lets say thorny vine drops in planes, and my ranger is the only ranger there, i personally dont want it...besides getting myself a full suit and wearing it to feel nolstagiac (lol, i screwed the spelling up there), and reminiscing of my old ranja pre kunark ;) it wont be of any worth to me.....oldworld planes armor is junk, but its still dumb to let it rot.....might as well have a backup suit of something in the bank to use on a wipeout or something ;)<br>
so...the solution i propose, is that if something drops that you dont want to loose points over, you can still take it and not recieve points for the current raid.....now some ppl wont even want to do this.......and in that case, let it rot.....<br>
spending 1 or 2 points on any class based no drop items for an entire raid would imo not be so costly as far as points go ;)<br>
<br>
we cant however, allow the system to, give 'free' loot....if we do, it will be abused.......plain and simple<br>
<br>
junk items that are unclaimed at the end of a raid, ie: meats and junk weps and junk armor tidbits etc will just be sold to vendor, no sense even selling in bazaar.....ppl that want to claim misc junk items can do so for free, ie: research components, meats and other cooking ingreds, or tradeskill ingreds in general......all this stuff will be randomed over so there is no confrontation over 2 frost giant meats ;) <p><HR>
