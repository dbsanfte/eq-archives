You are required very early on in the Quest to hand in your RotWF, but if you are 46+ and have a lot of friends or are in a guild, you will be able to take the Fists first to get the Fang, then complete the RotWF. The start of the Epic Quest originates with Tomekeeper Dahl, on the second floor within the Erudite Library. <br>
'Hail Tomekeeper Dahl'<br>
<br>
Tomekeeper Danl says 'Good day, citizen. Please remember to keep your voice down in our library. Feel free to browse the extensive collection of books we have on display. Learning is all about you and our library is the greatest collection of educational literature in the world, as you can no doubt see. However, there are a few books we do not own and we are prepared to pay well to acquire [rare finds]. <br>
<br>
'What rare finds?' <br>
<br>
Tomekeeper Danl says 'Yes, any rare books, tomes, essays, or other literature you find may be of interested to me. Although the finds I am interested in are quite high profile and would most likely only be found in the possession of very powerful or influential beings. Give me what you have found and I will pay you what it is worth to us.<br>
Now the book he requires, is the book of Immortals, a book found in Skyfire. It drops from any of the following - 'Soul Devourer' , 'lava walker' , 'Black Scar', 'a wandering wurm', 'a Shadow Drake', 'Guardian of Felia', or any other of the named mobs there. <br>
The following is the text from the book of Immortals:<br>
<br>
The immortals who can be spoken of are not the Eternal Immortals. Their Spoken names are not the eternal names. In the namelessness they are the beginning of heaven and earth. Named they are one of the ten thousand things.<br>
Though different in title they spring from one source and appear as darkness Darkness within darkness. The gate to their mystery. The immortals do not go forth. All comes to them. They are like the ocean, the king of ten thousand streams. By staying beneath they are a receptacle for all things. They do nothing. Yet are masters of the universe. Trorsmang! Be our course of action. Anbeal! Become the Vessel to hold our virtue. Drina! Be our stability, where we can take root. Cordan! Fill our vessels and calm our ambitions. Norrath! Take our husks and breathe life into them. We beseech you! Guide us in your humility.<br>
Giving Tomekeeper Dahl the Book of Immortals, prompts the following:<br>
Tomekeeper Danl gasps at the sight of the rare book and says, 'This is a great find indeed! I can only imagine who you had to.. persuade to give you the book. Our library would be very interested in acquiring this and I am prepared to give you this platinum and a referral that marks you as a friend of the library. If only [Lheao] could see this.' <br>
'Who is Lheao?' <br>
Tomekeeper Danl says 'Lheao was my predecessor here at the Library of Erudin. He has since retired, just a few years ago. I'm sure he would be most impressed with your find and offer insightful conversation on the subject. Although I'm not sure one of your profession would be interested in such a scholarly endeavor, no offense. If you are interested, find him and tell him you found the book 'Immortals.' I'm not sure where he has retired to, but I hear it is near an ocean somewhere. <br>
<br>
He gives you a piece of paper, Danl's reference, which identifies as 'Paper with the Erudin Library Seal'<br>
Lheao is found in the Timerous Deep in the hidden oasis. The loc is approximately neg 11500, neg 2000, where you will run into a huge rock wall that is a huge ring of solid rock. There is an underwater tunnel, which goes under this wall, at approx neg 11357 neg 3657.<br>
Once through that tunnel, you surface and see another huge rock. This second huge rock has another tunnel, so you have to stay underwater, and find the tunnel that goes under it. This finally leads you to the hidden oasis, where you see the hut with the ramp and Lhaeo.<br>
'Hail Lhaeo'<br>
<br>
Lheao jumps at your voice and begins laughing at his skittishness. He says, 'Ahh, hello there. Not many people know of this place, so visitors are quite rare. Hehehe. It's a very beautiful place indeed, so, ummm, please don't go telling everyone you know about it. Heheh. Thanks, friend.'<br>
<br>
'I have found the book Immortals' <br>
<br>
Lheao looks up at you, eyes wide in astonishment, and says, 'My god, you found 'Immortals'?! Where did you find it? Never mind, that is unimportant. I have in my possession a book that explains more about these individuals. Its value is unimaginable as well as the impact it is capable of. As you can see, I grow old. I need an individual to watch over this book and make sure it is protected. Would you be willing to [take this responsibility]?'<br>
<br>
'I will take this responsibility'<br>
<br>
Lheao says 'I'm sorry, Kage , but I could only give this book to a true master, such as a member of the Whistling Fists Order. And unless you can give me proof that you are one, in addition to Danl's reference, which is very unlikely, there is no way I'll let you take charge of [the Celestial Fists]. <br>
<br>
'What Celestial Fists?'<br>
<br>
Lheao says <br>
<br>
Once the Robe of the Whistling Fists and note (Dahl's reference) are handed in, the following is said.<br>
<br>
Lheao says 'Astonishing! To think that you are a master of an order thought to be lost to our world. Forgive my earlier doubts. I believe you are indeed worthy to be given the responsibility of watching over this book. Take great care that it does not fall into the wrong hands as it would be truly disastrous. <br>
The Celestial Fists Book is illegible<br>
