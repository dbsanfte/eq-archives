Immediately I got two responses from rangers in the guild who don't believe me.  So, I've decided to explain here how tracking works so that everybody can see it.  I want to get this out once and for all so that everybody can stop complaining about this skill.  It's NOT broken, it works perfectly well and here's how it works.<br>
<br>
HOW TRACKING WORKS (by Teshia Raye of Black Tower)<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Picture yourself as a level one ranger with a small invisible bubble around you that nobody can see.  It's a perfectly round bubble.  That's your range within which you can track objects.  So let's say you hit Track and you get five MOBs pops up, two bats, a mangy rat, a player, and an NPC.  Imagine also that you're grouped with the player on your list.  So here's how tracking works....<br>
<br>
The players you are grouped with always appear at the top of the list.  This is given precedence above everything else.  If you have five MOBs (in our example) and a whole mess of space underneath, it means that those five mobs/pcs/npcs are within the invisible tracking bubble.  If a MOB moves outside that bubble and you hit Track again, you'll get an updated list of 4 mobs/pcs/npcs with that MOB now gone.<br>
<br>
As new mobs/pcs/npcs enter that bubble, they are recorded in the order they entered the area.  The time they entered that bubble is remembered and this affects the way you see your list the next time you hit Track.  Let's use the same example from above but now it's twenty seconds later and three new MOBs have entered the tracking bubble since you last hit Track (this also assumes that nothing that was in the bubble has left the bubble within those twenty seconds).  First, a_skeleton04, then a_skeleton02, and finally, a_skeleton10.  The tracking window is now going to look like this:<br>
<br>
Finuala &lt;-- The PC you're grouped with<br>
a skeleton &lt;-- This is skeleton10 (the most recent)<br>
a skeleton &lt;-- This is skeleton02 (the second most recent)<br>
a skeleton &lt;-- This is skeleton04 (the third most recent)<br>
a bat<br>
Holly Windstalker &lt;-- The NPC<br>
a mangy rat<br>
a bat<br>
(followed by empty space below)<br>
<br>
Then, another mangy rat enters the bubble and one of the bats leaves the bubble:<br>
<br>
Finuala<br>
a mangy rat<br>
a skeleton<br>
a skeleton<br>
a skeleton<br>
Holly Windstalker<br>
a mangy rat<br>
a bat<br>
(followed by empty space below)<br>
<br>
Let's say a rare mob/npc suddenly pops within that bubble and it summons a pet soon after:<br>
<br>
Finuala<br>
Pyzjin Pet<br>
Pyzjin<br>
a mangy rat<br>
a skeleton<br>
a skeleton<br>
a skeleton<br>
Holly Windstalker<br>
a mangy rat<br>
a bat<br>
(followed by empty space below)<br>
<br>
This is great.  Now anything rares that pop within that bubble can instantly be found.  The down side is that if your bubble isn't big enough, you'll miss the pop of the MOB.  Now, that doesn't mean you won't see it.  If you run around the zone hitting Track over and over, you'll be sending new stuff through the bubble so quickly that eventually you might find the MOB.  The tracking bubble can be enlarged though.  Every time you improve your tracking skill, the bubble gets a little bit bigger.  A druid tracking bubble is fairly small, much like a low level ranger's tracking bubble.  This has it's advantages and disadvantages.  On the plus side, the lists remain small and if you see a MOB on your list, it's probably close by and easy to find.  On the down side, you'll miss a lot of potential items outside of that bubble and you'll get misreadings on where your party members are.<br>
<br>
What's that you say? That's a bug? No, it's no bug my friends.  Party members appear at the top of a list REGARDLESS of whether they're inside your tracking bubble or not.  In one sense, this is somewhat dangerous as it leads you to believe you can track them, which you may not always be able to do.  If they're inside the bubble, you'll be able to track them just fine.  If they're outside the bubble, you'll often get strange directions to those mobs, often the opposite direction of where they really are.  What's the point of that you ask? Well think about how tracking works in the real world.  If somebody is down the road from you and you're a tracker, you might be able to pick them up, but if they're too far, you could get led all over the place in the wrong directions.  So then the big question is, how do you know if they're inside your tracking bubble or not? You don't, and this is perhaps the flaw in Tracking as a skill.  It leads you to believe party members are always nearby and trackable, which they often are not.<br>
<br>
Now let's get back to the bubble.  A low level ranger tracking bubble and a high level druid bubble are somewhat the same.  A high level ranger tracking bubble is significantly larger.  So large in fact that a level 50+ ranger who is experienced at tracking (say a skill level of 190) could probably see anything that spawns in Dagnor's Cauldron if they stood right in the middle of the zone.  This is great stuff because basically, all they have to do is sit in the zone, keep hitting track and watch the list scroll downwards as new mobs popping in the zone appear near the top of the list and the old mobs roll off the bottom of the list.  They pretty much just have to wait until they see Bilge's name spawn at the top of the list and they're off and running after him.<br>
<br>
There are some down sides to this scrolling process as well.  It means that when tracking is as good as high level ranger tracking is, the list moves so fast with things popping in the zone, that a mob stays on a tracking list for all of a minute before it scrolls off the bottom.  Let's use an example from Sol B with a rare spawn.  Say everybody's doing Kobolds and nobody's doing bats and bugs, which is where the Guano Harvester, a rare mob, spawns.  It spawns and appears on top of your tracking list, but you never hit Track so you don't know it's up.  Minutes and minutes go by.  In that time, let's say 20-30 kobolds were killed off and new ones spawned in their place.  This means they've scrolled the Guano Harvester down the list, possibly right off the bottom of it.  Therefore, if you don't keep hitting tracking, you might scroll something valuable off the bottom, never to be tracked again unless it repops.  This again is another problem with the tracking window.  It needs a scroll bar.  My guess it, they KNOW it needs a scroll bar, they just don't want to be bothered implementing it or it's too much information to record so they feel it'll slow things down.<br>
<br>
Enter a busy zone sometime and hit Track.  You'll notice that as things get killed off, they start randomly dissapearing off the list, leaving holes.  This means the list isn't dynamically updated, so you have to keep hitting Track.  On the good side though, you don't have to cancel out of the tracking window to re-track.  If you have it set up as a hotkey (let's say it's F2 as an example), you can repeatedly hit F2 over and over again while viewing the tracking window and you'll see it appear to dynamically update, even though it's not doing that.  You'll still have to wait for the recovery delay, but it works.<br>
<br>
So yes, tracking could be better, and yes, it has it's up sides and down sides, but hey, nothing is perfect.<br>
<br>
But it's not broken.  That much I promise you.</font><P><OBJECT classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"

<br>
When the tracking list is first built, it randomly picks mobs within your tracking radius to fill the list.  I don't believe at the start that they are sorted by &quot;lifetime in zone&quot; but I could be wrong. <br>
<br>
Regardless of the initial build, however, it means that a high level ranger can go all night without seeing that special named NPC he or she has looking for in tracking (Coloth Meadowgreen is a good example in my case), because that npc has been around too long to show up in the tracking list that is full of newer mobs.  There were several instances where I was looking for something, never saw it on track, and it waltzed past me while I was sitting down.<br>

<br>
Kal, as for the building an initial list thing when you first enter the zone, that I don't know about but I can say this.  If a rare South Karana MOB walks past you and you've been sitting in South Karana for awhile, my guess is you're stone lucky.  If a rare walks around South Karana without somebody noticing and killing it, that's damn lucky.  Yes, I think it's filling the list with MOBs randomly, but without time stamps as to when the MOBs entered your tracking (because they entered all at once as soon as you entered the zone) I don't see what other option they have really.  I mean, they COULD list rare MOBs at the top of the list and give them precedence over things like centaurs and aviaks BUT why should they? Sure, they're rare, but in tracking a creature, what makes the scent of something rare stronger than that of an average aviak? Also, South Karana isn't a good place to have to track.  It's just too big.  I mean, I can stand at Paw and track and not see the NPCs at the centaur village, which isn't that far away.  I realise this isn't the same thing as what's happening to you, just saying how much I HATE tracking in South Karana.</font><P><OBJECT classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"

i am not telling it a bug because i dont like it, but because i think it was never intended to be like this. i am sure if they would have WANTED track to fail on large distances, they would have added a message like &quot;you have no idea in what direction whatever_is_tracked is.&quot;<br>
Using the word bug here for &quot;an anomality that was not intended by the programmers&quot;.<br>
<br>
P.S.<br>
I bet no one on Verant has ever &quot;planned&quot; or &quot;designed&quot; the hell-levels either. They are just a side effect on how experience points are calculated into your current level, and i bet the programmer who implemented this has never thought about that, they just wanted to increase the amount of xp needed for higher levels.<br>
Not saying they should fix it, we all have become used to that, and hey it can be fun even, makes certain level stand out more.</font><P></FONT><P><HR width=30% size=1 align=center>

Hell levels, although the psychological equivalent of a catastrophic earthquake, are not a bug either.  <br>
<br>
The number of experience points needed for advancement is recalculated every five levels.  This is done by using a perceived step basis, but in actuality is a mathmatical curve.  The rate of this curve is changed every five levels, creating what looks to be a normal curve with an increasingly steep grade toward the higher levels.  However, due to the nature of recalculating a curve after the grade increase without wiping out previous experience points gained, the amount of experience you gained is actually BELOW the starting point of the NEW curve.  So in actuality, during the &quot;hell level&quot; you are simply &quot;catching up&quot; to the new curve.  Notice how quickly exp bar movement is gained in 46 compared to 45?  Now compare 46 to 36.  36 moved faster.  Because the curve was less steep.  Now 47, 48, and 49 will be increasingly more difficult than was 46, as it should be.  Then 50 will recalculate the curve once again, and you will have your existing exp points in a curve that would ordinarily require FAR more exp points to BE 50.  So you will have to &quot;catch up&quot;.  That's the &quot;hell level&quot; phenomenon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So why not wipe previous exp, and start over with enough exp to begin the new curve?  Death.  If you die, you lose your level.  Suddenly, you are back to somewhere in the old exp level, but those exp points are now gone... so you're level 1 again.  Oops.  If they made it impossible to lose a level every 5 levels to retain the &quot;new&quot; exp, then people would abuse this to &quot;explore&quot; or rather exploit new areas without fear of loss.  Personally, I think they should have just spread out the levels of each &quot;hell level&quot; more evenly in terms of the cute little graphic bar, thus keeping the mathmatical anomaly from being revealed to the user, but it was their choice to allow it to be viewed, and now they have to deal with the bitching, hehe.  But trust me, there is no such thing as a &quot;hell level bug&quot;, it's simply catching up to the exp curve, and yes it does suck if you sit and watch the bar move... or NOT move, hehe.  Eternally 45, Kodi.<br>

-p.s.- I appreciate the explanation of the tracking mystery, Tesh.  I always thought it was a bug too, and am glad to understand it at last, hehe.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bblacktower89939.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=adita>Adita</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Local user</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#939393>5/31/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#939393>10:55:50 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fblacktower89939publicforum.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=36.topic&index=7><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Reply</FONT></A></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: But That's Just It</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">You have to explain me what you think what a bug is then ...<br>

The graphical representation of your experience via the yellow bubble thingies is simply a thermometer of sorts, showing that experience was indeed accumulated in your current level.  It is not based on a numerical figure, nor is it based on your total experience accumulated.  The bar simply shows the percentage of experience gained required to move from your current level to the next, without regard to any previous or future levels.  That's exactly why it appears to move slowly.  If it did indeed work as you suggested, by directly reflecting a numerical figure in regard to experience gained, then yes, it would stay entirely empty until you caught up to your level; and once &quot;caught up&quot;, it would raise incredibly fast, faster than the very gratifying &quot;1 and 6&quot; levels.  Hope this helps <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'm not saying it will help make levels 40, 45, etc., GO any faster, but knowing WHY something sucks certainly alleviates some of the resulting frustration... for me in any case <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

As far as the tracking bit I have to disagree with one section of Tesh's theory as it pertains to other people in your party.  I have never gotten a &quot;false reading&quot; on party member location even if I was on the other side of a huge zone unless my party members are on the move themselves.  If they are stationary I can be anywhere in a zone and still get a correct read on their location as it pertains to me.

Last night I was trying to get Aligaheri and Faunas from Emerald Jungle to Field of Bones, and every time I tracked either one of them, I ended up at some ruins.

However if you take the time to explore the zone you will find that on the other side of that mountain is the mob you are looking for right where the tracking director tell you.  I experienced this often in the Rathe Mts a zone I know very well at times I would get what appeared to be a false reading on a hill giant only to discover it was one that had been kited or trained out of the hill giant spawning area and was either coming back from the zone or stuck trying to come back.  Another example is when camping the troll gaurds the necromancer gnome Findlerod or whatever would always give a reading of right behind me an impassable Mountain however his spawn point is directly on the otherside of that Mountain by simply circling around you can reach him.
