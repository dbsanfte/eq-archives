Nearby, a pond of pure molten fire and brimstone bubbled and spewed forth more steam and smoke. The distant roar of an inflamed fire drake echoed over the near barren surroundings. A small figure sat silently upon the top of a large boulder against a much larger mound of blackened stone. Knees against chest and hands locked around them, the figure stared off past the billowing clouds of smoke, past the hot glow that seemed to radiate from all of the Lavastorm Mountains, to the barely visible stars in the night time sky. Time seemed to slow as the lithe figure relaxed in the solitude of the moment. <br>
<br>
Katrinity sighed softly, her mind racing with so many thoughts it was hard to sort them all out. Her fingers glided silently through her silver locks as her gaze was locked on one fiery bright star directly opposite her, deep in the reaches of space. What would she give to visit such a place, to stand upon its surface and shout out to the planes the glories of her 'Father'. Her chest swelled with pride as images of her brothers and sisters, Chosen Ones of the Father, filled her mind's eye. Such a strong race were they, both of mind and of will and of arm. Like some deadly predatory cat stalking its prey silently through the rushes, so did a thought slip invisibly into her train of thinking, hiding behind the feeling of pride for her people, ready to pounce at any moment. <br>
<br>
Katrinity's smile slowly drooped as she continued to think. The other races of Norrath. She had heard her brothers and sisters call them unclothe cattle, vile worms, un-faithful beggars of false gods(and goddesses), the list of names went on and on, all of which she had heard all her life. Yes, she immitated her elders, cat-calling the wood elves, the dwarfs, the humans, cursing them with harsh words and dishonoring metaphors. But still something nagged at the fringes of her mind. She was honestly curious about these other peoples, though her own race shunned them half of the time and slaughtered them the other. She saw them as other beings upon this world, nothing more and nothing less, but her curiousity possessed her and she was intently interested in them. For once in Katrinity's life, the well-tempered hate she kept leashed to her side, ready to strike out at her foes, failed her. How does one fight back against something that can not be touched? How does one slay the beast within? How does one conquer her own mind? <br>
<br>
Katrinity shivered, huddling tighter into a ball, resting her face against her knees. Her friends and companions had travelled on hours ago, she remaining behind to be alone. How she wished they were with her now...Being alone has its own dangers beyond having no one to guard your back. She so wanted to seek comfort in Shaydara's strong leadership, Loth's fiery spirit, or Jerichan's iron-willed honor. She was learning for the first time what it was to have family, within in the Blades, and yet she felt so very very alone. <br>
<br>
And the wind did howl over the peaks, swirling and dancing along the updrafts of super-heated air to spill out upon the rocky borders, silver flashing and dancing in a small shadow upon the blackened stone.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ukatrinity.showPublicProfile>Katrinity</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br>   <font color=#939393>(4/12/00 10:42:29 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Jungle Fever</span><hr size=1>    The oppressive air of the jungle pressed in all around the lone figure as a lithe hand streaked up to swat at a blood-fly before her face. Damn this reeking cesspit of a land, she thought to herself, no wonder the only ones that claim it are the lizard throwbacks and the thick-headed ogres. Katrinity turned her head suddenly to the noise of crashing feet through the thick foilage, those of the ones hunting her. Darting past the surrounding trees, the young rogue's feet sped through the unfamilar ground, carrying her away from scaley death. Off to the right, the sound of a rushing river became audible just as the harsh lisping tongue of a lizardman shaman casting a spell joined it. Katrinity cursed loudly, altering her course toward the water. She broke through the jungle's thick bush, a wide expanse of roaring water before her. To her rear, the crashing of foilage became even louder as the shaman's harsh casting came to a close. Suddenly Katrinity screamed as her flesh was awash in flames, the fire dancing over her entire form like some fanciful creature given life. The sickening sweet scent of burning flesh and leather mixed in the air as she stumbled forward to tumble into the roaring river. Soft, cool relief...time to sleep...sleep..... <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------ <br>
<br>
   With a gentlness unlike most of his kind, a large <br>
figure delicately picked several tiny, exotic flowers <br>
from the side of a mossy tree. Moving on, he repeated the process at every other trunk, plucking red, gold, green, purple, and black petals along with the occassional mushroom, each and everyone of some purpose to one with herbal-lore. As the bulky figure finished up his rounds, he headed toward the nearby stream to look for some aquarian-towles, a needful ingredient to any healing concoction. The figure reached the water's edge, bending over to dip his large hand into its cooling embrace. His hand slowly sought through the water, drawing back as a shadowy bulk bumped into his searching hand. Puzzlement etched his massive brow as he carefully reached for the shadowy thing under the water, cautious if it was some predatory creature lying in wait. Surprise joined puzzlement as he lifted up the scarred, burned body of a young Teir'dal, a female at that. Cradling her small frame in the crook of his arm, he examined her with a critical eye, grunting softly as he surmised she had not passed on yet. Gathering up the large pouch, he was collecting his flora in, into his free hand, he turned and swiftly made his way through the jungle, treading a hard to see trail. Within half an hour, the large figure with its small bundles, trotted into a quiet clearing, the clearing's boundaries etched with many runes all around it as if they somehow keep the jungle from growing into the open space. The figurecontinued toward the center of the clearing as a hut constructed of hides and bones became visible. Ducking into the interior of the refuge with practiced ease, the bulky figure carried his small, living bundle over to one of the hut's corners where a mound of soft furs lay at rest. The figure lowered the young female to the furs, settling her in with the same gentlness used earlier to pick flowers. Turning, the large figure shuffled over to several rough-made shelves, taking a ceramic pot from here, a vial from there, some cloth bandagings from the top section. He hurried back over to the dark elf as a low moan escaped her lips. He set his things down beside her as he began work on her numerous injuries. Hours passed.... <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------ <br>
<br>
   Consciousness crept upon Katrinity like some violent beast, waking her with a flash of pain and numbing agony. Just opening her eyes was enough to make her contemplate going blind the rest of her days. The memory of flames and burning returned as she shuddered, reaching up to feel her face. She sighed in relief as it wasn't as bad as she feared. No horrible scars of lasting effect...how did that come to be, she thought, it felt much worse than this. She struggled up, only able to get to resting upon her elbows. Her eyes slowly surveyed the surroundings, taking it all in. She was covered over in fine furs, warm and comforting. The room she was in, she realized was one structure, the entire home in one large space. Wood shelves lined two of the walls, while in the corner opposite her rested a firepit, still radiating a faint heat. What attracted her attention most was the rows upon rows of bones, from teeth to skulls to femurs, hanging from the ceiling, dangling down in some odd pattern. Her gaze switched quickly to the entrance of the room as a large shape moved to block the incoming light. Her hand went instinctively for her blade to find it was not there, which considering she was unclothed, was expected. The figure stepped into the room, the face of an ogre coming into view as he made a gentle soothing motion with one of his massive hands. Katrinity was a bit taken back as the ogre padded softly over to a makeshift chair, conviently his size. He was drapped in a fine scale-like hide, many runes carved into it. Along with that, several bone-laced necklaces and brillantly colored feathers decorated his thick neck and long, shaggy hair. &quot;Who are you and how did I come to be here?&quot;, Katrinity voiced with some concern. The ogre blinked slightly as if he failed to comprehend the language she used, then allowed a slight, what can only be called a smile, play across his wide lips. He made a soft grunting noise, reaching over to retrieve a small clay bowl from a shelf. With two fingers, he dabbed them into the bowl slashing water in her direction, setting the bowl down to carve a rune into the dirt floor of the hut. He pointed again at her, grunting as if to form a word with his lips but unable. Katrinity grimaced as she craned her neck to glance over at the rune, not really understanding what it stood for. As the pain came again, she rested her head once more upon the furs. &quot;Well which ever, you have my thanks large one, now I think&lt;yawn&gt; I will rest again....g'night..&quot;, Katrinity muttered as exhausted rest overcame her. A few hours latter, she sleepily opened her eyes, glancing cautiously around the room once more. Of the ogre there was no sign. Nodding to herself and muttering under her breath, Katrinity wrestled herself up into a sitting position. After a moment to rest in her current position, she slowly dragged herself, with no undue amount of pain, over to her belongings that were conviently stored against a wall not far from her. With a shaking hand, she opened her backpack, laying there along with her leathers and weapons, rifling through her things she slowly extracted that which she was looking for. Cradling the small statuette in her palms, the same dread sense, along with it the smell of battle raging in full swing, washed over her again as when she first stole the thing, &quot;I hope you were worth it...&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ukatrinity.showPublicProfile>Katrinity</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br>   <font color=#939393>(4/12/00 10:47:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Fine Art of Chance</span><hr size=1> The night air was cold. Cold as the heart of the undead in the darkest Necromancers' lair. Cold as a winter morning in the Permafrost. It was just damn cold in a word. A lithe figure moved slightly from its place in the shadows, overlooking the run-down shack called a building by the Freeport citizens. The wood of its make was nearly worn through by weather and insects, leaving a unsturdy, eyesore of a home. But what could one expect in the slums of one of the dirtiest cities in Norrath. Flashes of silver gleamed out into the cold darkness of nighttime as the figure swept its flowing locks back, tying it snuggly back with a leather thong. It wouldn't do to have it flashing too openly or chance it obscuring her vision if something happened. The figure peered about once more to make sure no one was in close sight. With a quick movement, the figure suddenly ran straight off the ream of the roof of the building, plummeting downward. The chill air rushed past her as she tensed in mid-air, gripping the length of rope tied tightly around her waist. The figure jerked as the rope pulled the descent to a silent, sudden halt, its length taunt from her waist up to the brace on the roof. She caught her breath for a moment, dangling inches from a closed window, still stories from the rough-paved street below. The figure carefully reached out, gripping the edge of the window sill. She pulled herself close to it, bracing her feet on notches below it that the rotting wood had created. Ever so slowly, the figure lifted up on the window, feeling it slide rustily upward. <br>
<br>
Katrinity silently lifted her leg through the small open space below the window, inching her way into the building. As her foot touched the floor, she eased weight off of it to avoid a creaking of the old wood. Moving slowly and with all of her thieving ablities, Katrinity slipped into the room with not a sound. Her fingers moved quickly as she untied the rope from her waist, laying it discreetly on the edge of the window. The soft hiss of drawn steel filled the air as she pulled one of her dagger from its sheath. Her gaze probed the dark recesses of the room, looking for any sign of movement. After several minutes of careful observation, Katrinity stalked through the dust covered junk of the attic room. She slowed as she neared the stairwell leading downstairs. The young rogue heard the distinct of noise and merry-making of men down the stairwell. Her informant had been right! That could only mean it was nearby! As her foot just touched the first step of the stairs, Katrinity noticed something. The entire floor and items of the attic was covered in a thick layer of dust. Besides her new boot prints upon that dust, nothing marred it...except for a trail of more heavily soled boots over to the far corner of the room. Katrinity padded slowly, placing each footstep carefully on the noisy floorboards, toward the corner. She held in a sneeze from all the chured-up dust in the air, as her gaze fell on a barely dust covered series of chests. She grinned slightly as she bent over, examining the chests and their locks. Moving as quickly, but stealthily as possible, Katrinity removed her picks from her pouch, inserting them in the first chest lock. A satisfing 'click' followed in moments. She glanced over her shoulder to the noise still coming from downstairs before her gaze once more rested on the chest. Slowly...slowly she raised its wooden lid, peering into the depths of its chamber. Coins. A virtual fountain of coins lay hidden in the chest. Katrinity made a soft disgusted noise as she moved to the next chest, still in pursuit of her prey this eve. A few minutes passed. 'Click'. Fine garments. Hidden beneath, some gems. Snort. A few more minutes passed. 'Click'. Ahhh, books and scrolls. Finally what she had come in search of. Katrinity unsealed each scroll, muttering nearly without sound as she tried to read each contents. She made a slow go of it, but she could read each. The last scroll came into her grip as she unrolled it. Katrinity's lips curled slightly at the ends as she peered over the ancient language. She could not read it, which was a good sign, but she recognized a few of the symbols as what she was looking for. This scroll was scribed in a language that had not been placed to paper for centuries. The young rogue turned around as she stuffed the scroll into her shirt, laying it snug against her bosom. With a swift, silent step, Katrinity padded back toward the window. Halfway between the window and the stairwell, her pace stopped dead. A sound. A sound on the stairs. Creak. Creak. Creak. The rogue ducked down low, making herself as still and hidden as she could. Messy, dirt brown hair was the first thing she saw coming slowly upwards on the stairs, followed by the slighly pale features of a human. A male at that and from the smell already reaching Katrinity's sensitive nostrils, a drunk one. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hmmm hmm hmmmmmghup! Ecuse'm. Oooh'wat cun ya get wen ya dun't'hav'n noh coin! Ya cun gettin druunk jiz wat! Hiccuh! Err..ecuse'm.&quot; <br>
<br>
Katrinity frowned in disgust at the wretched excuse for a human came to the last step, tittering on its edge before he stumbled into the attic. Her eyes narrowed as the human attempted, to walk prehaps, toward the chests she had just been rummaging though. She remained utterly still as the human's glazed sight finally noticed the open chests. Her hand already was in motion as his voice raised into a shout &quot;VVVEEERRRRGRhhahhhh...sh...&quot;. His shout of some human's name was cut off as Katrinity's dagger sank into the back of his neck, severing his spinal cord just below the skull. The human crumpled lifelessly to the ground as distant shouts and stomping of boots became heard below. Katrinity cursed to herself as she turned, sprinting toward the window. She leaped head first through the space of the opened window, once more freefalling toward the street that was coming upwards at her at a startling pace. Katrinity tucked her body into a ball, rolling through the air forward a bit. The ground was mere yards below her as her tucked form crashed into an awning, hanging over a ground level window on the building next to the one she just leaped from. The awning slowed her descent before tearing under her as Katrinity slammed into a pile of refuse under the window. A sharp curse emitted from the now moving pile of garbage, scaring a nearby mutt that was picking through it. <br>
<br>
Katrinity pulled herself out of the stinking mush, grimacing at her filthy form. Glancing up to the window, she saw several human faces peering back at her. With a crooked little grin on her face, Katrinity waved to the angry, shouting men. She patted the scroll in her shirt as she padded down the alleys of Freeport. A brief flash of silver flickered through the streets as the cold night's air chilled more than one corpse in its sweet embrace.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ukatrinity.showPublicProfile>Katrinity</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br>   <font color=#939393>(4/12/00 11:39:01 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Beginnings and Alleys</span><hr size=1> /ooc Yes! Found my intro just a bit ago =) Yeah for me<br>
<br>
Silent shadows danced across the cold stone walls of the alleys of Neriak. The distant clinking of steel against steel, of hushed whispers between conspirators, and the soft swish of a sharp blade entering flesh echoed over the hard surfaces that made up Neriak. In the shadows, away from all the sounds filling the rest of the city, huddled a single small figure. Silver glimmered suddenly as the small figure shifted in its hiding place. <br>
<br>
The small figure shivered and looked up sharply as the drunken muttering of a warrior that had had one too many drinks, became hearable at the entrance of the alley. Stumbling noisely, the drunk strolled down the debris-filled path, lost in his drunken stupor. As his large shadow passed over the small figure huddled against one of the walls, his foot became entangled in a heap of discarded old rope. With a loud curse and a resounding crash, he crumpled to the ground while a half-empty bottle of Kalesh(sp) fell from his hand to shatter against the stones. The drunken warrior cursed, as he rose to his knees, oaths that could make the foulest sailor blush. Glancing around the broken shards of glass, he grumbled drunkenly, looking to see if any of the liquid remained. Finding nothing, he stood wobbely on his feet as he tried to regain his balance. <br>
<br>
The warrior reached for his money pouch to discern if he had enough for another bottle of drink when his attention was caught by the flash of silver from the shadows right before him. His face contorted into a drunken-puzzled look as he reached out to the silver thing. Grabbing a hold of whatever was causing the silver flash, he pulled it into the faint light of the street lamp. A strangled yelp startled him as he gazed at a young Teir'dal female whose hair was clenched in his hand. &quot;Wo' tha bludy hells' are ya?&quot;, he said drunkenly, his breath reeking of Kalesh and beer. The young girl, no more than 14 or 15 years of age, briefly appeared frightened at the huge warrior looming over her but her features quickly grew into a mask of fierce disgust and hatred. &quot;Who I am be no consern of yours, now leave me be..&quot;, she stated defiantly. This took the a moment for the addled brains of the dark elven warrior to process but when the contempt in the the young female's voice set in, he glared. With a backhand, the drunk sent her reeling backwards against the alley wall. &quot;Wo' da hell ya think you talking ta! I'v kill'in bigre halflings thon ya, ya litle whur! Put ya in yar place *burp* yesh I will'n..shorn ya wha' ya was mude to du!&quot; The warrior's looked at the little female with drunken lust filled eyes, tinted with superiority, as he smacked her across the face again before his hands began fumbling with the cords of his breeches. Finding his dexerity in his fingers greatly hampered by his current state, the warrior looked down and using both hands had a try at it. <br>
<br>
As his gaze left the crumpled form of the young female, something other than silver glimmered off of her. The cold flash of steel appeared in her hand as she slowly rose to a crouched position, legs bent as she coiled back. Muttering and cursing, the drunk was about halfway done getting his breeches undone, his attention still drawn to his crotch. The young girl clicked her tongue softly as the warrior's eyes glanced up at her form. Legs unfolding, propelling her forward, she hurtled at the drunken warrior, hitting him square in the mid-riff. Normally such a blow from such a small person would only rock the strong warrior slightly, but in his current drunken state of balance and considering his breeches had slide down his thighs, he tumbled backwards with a surprised oof and a thud. Steel flashed again...and again..and again...and again. Fully wakened from his stupor the warrior rose to a sitting position, glancing in puzzlement as the young female backed away from him slowly, her dagger slick with fresh blood. With dawning understanding, the warrior felt his unarmored neck(though he was didn't really have any armor on considering it was all up in his inn room), his hand came away awash in blood...his blood! What! How!? were his last thoughts as death's cold hand crept over him. The last image imprinted into his dying mind was that of a dark smirk on the lips of the young Teir'dal female. Death came. <br>
<br>
Smiling smuggly to herself, Katrinity bended over the dead warrior's form, being careful not to step in the pool of blood slowly extending around him. With a deft, quick hand she discarded him of his money pouch and a few other valuable little items. Strolling down the alley, she glanced around to make sure no one saw the scene before she slipped out into the main street and into another alley to her hidden equipment. Quickly, Katrinity disrobed from the rags she was wearing, pulling on her snug leather apparel. Once fully dressed, she opened the warrior's money pouch, eyes silently counting up her takings. &quot;Mmmh..not bad for a night's work, wish I had a few more like it.&quot; Katrinity absently touched a hand to the bruises upon her cheek, noting she needed to visit with a priest of the Father in the near future, a mark on her complexion wouldn't do. A smirk fromed on her lips as she walked back onto the street, slipping into more shadows in Neriak... <br>

Silvery hues flashed along with the greens as locks of fine hair fluttered along the wind currents. Almost absently a hand came up, pulling the loose locks from the field of vision of ice-blue eyes. A dark lower lip was gently gnawed between pearly whites. Gaze locked over the rolling hills and plains of the Karanas, Katrinity watched as the blazing sun, in all its crimson glory, reach out toward the earth, the sweet smothering earth, as it descended toward darkness. The heat waves distorted the very air around the falling ball of fire, creating a hallucinatory vision. Kat wrapped her small hands around each of her kneecaps, gripping as she said upon the soft bed of grass. The wind continued to beat against her back in her rather open resting spot. Normally she would never be so out in the open, her profession relied on the very opposite. Today was different and she had no clue why. Call it a feeling. Katrinity had been having many of those as of late. Feelings of everything falling apart. Feelings of being so alone. Prehaps that was why she sat upon the vast open plains of the Karanas now, prehaps that was why she watched the sun set. Weeks had passed since last Kat had made contact with any of her comrades, her allies, her friends. Alone she sat, snuggly sitting amoung the long stalks of grass. At peace, if only for a time. Peace was such a fragile state, something she rarely thought of. But at that moment, she was at peace. Prehaps that is why the pack of roaming wolves pasted her by, leaving her in peace. Prehaps that is why no gnolls appeared in the area, screaming for blood. Prehaps.....so many things hinge on the unknown. Soon would be the time to return to Neriak. To discover what had taken place last she left. To learn what ancient writtings hide within their harsh lines. But not at that moment. No, now was the time for watching the sun, the sun plumment into darkness... As Katrinity silently gazed out over the sea of grass, dark clouds rolled in with the wind from behind her. Drops of rain, few to begin, many in but a few moments, pounded into the earth, plastering grass and silver hair down. The tip of the sun flared one more time over the distant horizon, falling into darkness, as drops of water rolled down ebony skin, past ice-blue eyes, fresh mixing with salt to taste bitter-sweet upon shaded lips. <br>
