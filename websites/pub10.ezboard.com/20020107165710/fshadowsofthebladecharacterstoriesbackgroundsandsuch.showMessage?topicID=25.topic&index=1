<br>
&quot;Xyzax, what do you know of the death of your family?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know that it was the soft skins who did this. I admit I do not know how, since they are no more than slave material, but all I have eversought out returns to this statement.<br>
<br>
&quot;Child, not all soft skins are like the frogloks you see about this city.&quot;<br>
<br>
Xyzax was confused. Not all like the frogloks? What other kind of soft skin could there be? The headmistress saw his confusion, and tried to explain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Child, you know of the oceans far off? Well, across those oceans there are lands where no Iksars have tred in ages. The leaders say that it is because of this that the soft skins in these lands have flourished. Some even say that our Dread Lord has taken some on as followers when we became too at ease as his chosen ones - to put more of a fear that we could be replaced into our hearts.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Replaced? But we are the chosen ones of Cazic Thule! Why would we be replaced?&quot;<br>
<br>
The headmistress raised an eyebrow and said, &quot;You question the dread ones motives enough to call his full name?&quot;<br>
<br>
Xyzax's heart began to race as he realized the folly of his actions - questioning his god's actions and using his full name in the process? What was wrong with him?<br>
<br>
The headmistress saw the turmoil in his eyes, and looked at him with a calming look so as to reassure him. &quot;Do not worry young one - if there were to be repercussions, they would have come already. You are safe for now.&quot;<br>
<br>
His heart slowed slightly as he realized the truth in her words, but he was still somewhat on edge - after all, one can never tell when or how a god of fear might strike.<br>
<br>
&quot;In any event, it was these soft skins who killed your family - or at least it was thought so.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thought so? What do you mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, your father's leather tunic was found, as was his staff - but none of the bodies were. I must tell you something now, a part of why it was you were sent here rather than one of the other hatcheries in the city or elsewhere. You see, your mother was a broodmate of mine. She and I were from the same collection of eggs in fact. And so, I asked to have you sent here under my protection while I quietly researched the truth of that day.&quot;<br>
<br>
Xyzax felt his world beginning to shift on it's very axis - soft skins other than the likes of frogloks? No bodies of his family found? Then why were no parties sent out to get them? Why were they left in the wilds? Then there was the headmistress - or rather his mother's broodmate. For thule's sake, his mother's hatchmate in fact. What did she mean protection? Or by research?<br>
<br>
Headmistress Ishkabibble watched as the questions passed through Xyzax's mind. She sat quiet letting it all sink in, and then said, &quot;Now, there is more I must tell you on this matter - and I must tell you before you go, for once you have gone, you will not be able to return for quite some time.&quot;<br>
<br>
