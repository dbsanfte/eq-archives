A presence, is found in the Plane of Sky, and is the Place Holder for the Fist of Air. The presence seems to have a respawn time of approx 2 hours. He has the model of a shadowed man, but carries no items, so is invisible apart from his name.<br>
Note: The Charred Scale does not have to be cycled through Kaiaren's true form before being given to 'a presence', so this part can be skipped, but it is advisable to follow the story as intended.<br>
If you travel to sky, rather than paying for the keys, kill the fairies, and have everyone loot a miniature sword. If you then kill the thunder spirit princess, she will spawn Sirran the lunatic. When everyone hands in the mini swords, you get a key of swords back. As with many guides on Sky, do not speak, (use /ooc instead) as if anyone says the key word [hassle] he will despawn. It is advisable not to buff people up until you are in sky, as zoning up removes all buffs. Now find the 'soapdish ashtray key platform thing' {Hotrod's term, not mine}, and drop the key on to use it, and it takes you to Dojorn isle, where the presence and Gwan are.<br>
Hand the Presence the scale for the following: a presence says 'Hahaha! That dolt Eejag fell to the likes of you? I'm not surprised. So, I guess this means you're here to challenge me. Normally, I wouldn't waste my time, but since you've defeated my younger brother, I suppose I'm obligated. I'm ready when you are, tell me when you're [prepared]. <br>
<br>
At this point the presence despawns and immediately respawns in the same location as a Human monk dressed in shiverback named Gwan. Telling him 'I am prepared' causes him to attack. <br>
<br>
He doesn't respond to hails, and is lvl 57. He procs Fist of Air, which a lvl 57 resisted every proc with a MR of 120. <br>
<br>
He has approx 8khp, hits for 165, and the Fist of Air proc can knock you backwards, and like other mobs of this level, enrages.<br>
<br>
Upon death, Gwan's corpse lets out one last, frustrated breath and gasps, 'Trunt! Prepare yourself!'<br>
Tactics:The 'a presence' is on Dojorn's island, and has the look of a shadowed man. Dojorn and the bladestorms, also on the island, have been confirmed that they will not attack and help, or KS Gwan.<br>
You cannot trade (i.e. give him the scale from Eejag,) with the presence while it is in the windmill. Give the scale to a presence, Gwan will spawn, then pull him into the windmill and kill him. Pulling him is recommended to be done while in Melee range, i.e. walking backwards with him. Running off will cause him to path incorrectly, and disappear to another island. It is highly recommended to pull him into the Windmill.<br>
It is possible for 6 people to kill Gwan (although it is recommend to have more, the original group was high 50's-60th lvl). Gwan is 100% MR, and only the lure line spells seem to hit him. He also required melee range for even Lure line to stick<br>
He drops nothing but the Breath of Gwan, which id's as Item Lore: Remains of the Fist of Air<br>
Important Note: Do not hand the The Breath of Gwan to the true form of Kaiaren, as it will be eaten. The Breath is required for the next step, Trunt<br>
~~Trunt~~ <br>
Within the mines of Nurga, which is located in the Frontier Mountains, there is 'a sleeping Ogre', near a number of spiders not too far into the dungeon. A good marker is a unique graphic to this dungeon, which is a smoking hole in the wall, where you can see lava. When he is spawned he is looking right at that crevice in the wall. The Sleeping Ogres respawn time is approx 1 hour 45 mins<br>
He is KOS, and he says nothing except some kind of sleeping message when you hail him while charmed. Turning in the breath of Gwan spawns Trunt, which is done by sneaking behind him, or charming him, and gets this response:<br>
<br>
a sleeping ogre says 'Your path of wanton destruction ends here, Southern . Gwan and Eejag were impatient and hot-headed. You will not defeat me, for I have the patience and perseverance of stone, unlike the children you have beaten before me. Are you sure you want to challenge me, Southern?<br>
When answering the Sleeping Ogre, Trunt, who is KOS, spawns.He is around 59th level Ogre, who double hits for around 176, has alot of HP, possibly more than the 8k of Gwan, and is also immune to magic. He also attacks faster than the others. Trunt has no faction, and says no message when he dies. He drops nothing but the Head.<br>
<br>
Trunts Head identifies as Remains of the fist of earth<br>
<br>
~~Deep~~ <br>
The next of the Celestial Fists is Deep. She is approx a level 58 Dark Elf, and lives under Lake Rathe, and is surrounded by Bloodgill Goblins. Her location is under the 3 Bird platform (the one with the flame on it)<br>
When Trunts head is handed to her, she says the following.<br>
Deep slowly opens her eyes and looks up at you. She stares at you a long while and then closes her eyes and lowers her head again, saying, 'Very well, Arakos, if you wish death so greatly, we will be happy to oblige. My master projects part of himself in the wilder lands known as the Overthere. He has granted you an audience. Find him and show him the head of our earth brother. At that point, we will discuss how we will end your life. <br>
No Experience is received and Deep despawns immediately. You get the Head of Trunt handed back<br>
Note: Trunts Head does not have to be cycled through Deep, and this part can be skipped, but as mentioned above, it is advisable to follow the story as intended<br>
~~Astral Projections~~ <br>
Moving on, we have the Astral Projections. There is one in the Overthere, and one in the Lake of Ill Omen, with the Overthere Astral Projection being the first of the two. He is approx 52nd level, and if fought was hitting for 175 damage, and says nothing on death. His approximate location is 772, 860, neg 494, and is in the bottom of the scorpion chasm. He does not need to be fought.<br>
Handing the Projection Trunts head, results in the following Astral Projection looks up and down and says, 'Hmmm, I was hoping for something more impressive. This is just a small token of the last person who tried to interfere with my plans. He failed as you shall. But tell me truly, are you the one who has so rudely removed my students?'<br>
<br>
'yes' <br>
<br>
Astral Projection says 'I assume you have read about us and spoken with the old man, Kaiaren. Since that time, I have grown in power and influence to a point unseen by any mortal. Unfortunately, I will have to demonstrate a small amount of my skill when I destroy you. This is bad. I must decide whether you are worthy to see the techniques I wield, even though you will die shortly thereafter. Tell me, Ashana , who are you? <br>
<br>
'I am the one' <br>
<br>
Astral Projection chuckles and says, 'That's quite a boast, Ashana. All beings strive for nothingness at the most basic level of sentience. However, almost none ever achieve this. Not even I have discarded my ego yet and you stand here and tell me you have? Perhaps you will be a worthy opponent. I shall be waiting in the great lake near here. Take that token as proof of things to come for you. If you still wish to throw your life away so needlessly, return it to my image there. I await your decision.' He will give you an Eye of Kaiaren, and then the Astral Projection despawns.<br>
<br>
He is a 3 hour spawn<br>
It is not sure where in the text the Eye of Kaiaren is given, and it is only the final text (telling him that 'I am the one') that despawns the Projection. So it is possible to give in Trunts head, receive the eye and leave the AP without despawning him. <br>
Note: As with the previous warnings, for the sake of someone else waiting 3 hours for the respawn, I would despawn the projection. There were (prior to a recent patch) chances that Deep would spawn in the LoIO alone, without Vorash, so anything to minimize that chance is helpful.<br>
~~The Final Fight~~<br>
The second of the Astral Projections is in the Lake of Ill Omen, and is on a platform on the lake itself. The Platform is too high to climb onto, but SoW and Levitation can get you up there. He is identical in appearance to the other Projection. <br>
Note: Another way to minimize the chances of Vorash and Deep not spawning together, is to have your groups on the edges of the platform, and hand the 'eye' in at the maximum distance allowed for trading. You can never be too careful<br>
When you give the Eye of Kaiaren to the Astral Projection, he despawns immediatly, and Deep and Vorash both spawn, who are KOS<br>
Deep procs Fist of Water, and hits for 170ish. Vorash procs Fist of Mastery, which is a DD and a stun, and hits for around the same as Deep.<br>
<br>
Both Deep and Vorash have no items.<br>
<br>
Once killed, Vorash says 'Foolish mortal! You think you have defeated me? Now, witness the true power of Rallos Zek Xenevorash will then spawn on the platform, regardless of where Vorash dies<br>
Xenovorash Procs Fist of Sentience which is a 500DD and a stun, and hits for 250 ish.<br>
<br>
Once he is killed, his death message is: <br>
<br>
Xenevorash's corpse shouts 'Grraaaagghhhh!! NOT.. POSSIBLE! <br>
<br>
He drops a Demon's Fang.<br>
Tactics: The final battle was done with 4 groups, which where all 52 to 58th level, one group was on Deep, all with high CR, and 3 groups where all on Vorash, with high MR. Due to the large amount of people involved, the fight was not bad, with no casualties. <br>
Some groups pull Deep and Vorash to the 'beach', and this is normally done by a Bard or Druid with a faster than SoW song/spell, but this is not nescesary, and the fight can easily be done on the platform.<br>
Xenevorash always runs on low health, so if fighting on the platform, he will run into the water. <br>
~~The Celestial Fists~~ <br>
Please remember that the book needed to be handed to the True Form first, for you to receive the quest information in the first place, (as in he prompts you to look for Eejag.) Once this (now different) book has been returned to you, it is now ready to be handed to Kaiaren along with the Fang. <br>
Handing the True Form of Kaiaren the Book and the Fang, results in the Celestial Fists being handed over, with the following text.<br>
Kaiaren bows his head and breathes a long sigh as if relived of a great weight. He then looks up at you and says, 'I honestly did not believe you could have defeated Vorash. Even though he sought nothing but war and bloodshed, it is a life nonetheless and we must mourn him. I will sew these fangs into magical fist wraps and they shall be yours. Remember Xenevorash. A purpose can be found for every situation and individual. To achieve perfection is to perceive this truth.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/fclanbloodtalon32452frm8.showPrevMessage?topicID=10.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/fclanbloodtalon32452frm8.showNextMessage?topicID=10.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fclanbloodtalon32452frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/oceana/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fclanbloodtalon32452frm8.emailToFriend?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fclanbloodtalon32452frm8.threadControl?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/oceana/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fclanbloodtalon32452frm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fclanbloodtalon32452frm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub10.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="clanbloodtalon32452frm7">Guild Events & Quest Help<option value="clanbloodtalon32452frm8">Epic Quests <option value="clanbloodtalon32452frm9">Clan Bloodtalon Family Room<option value="clanbloodtalon32452frm10">Guild Member Rolster<option value="clanbloodtalon32452frm11">Clan Bloodtalon Library<option value="clanbloodtalon32452frm12">Guild Vault<option value="clanbloodtalon32452frm13">Clan Bloodtalon Inner Sanctum<option value="clanbloodtalon32452frm14">Clan Bloodtalon Allies<option value="clanbloodtalon32452frm15">Charter<option value="clanbloodtalon32452frm16">Rules of Conduct<option value="clanbloodtalon32452frm17">Accusation Chair</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000099>- </font><a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bclanbloodtalon32452>Clan Bloodtalon</a><font color=#000099> - </font><a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fclanbloodtalon32452frm8>Epic Quests </a> <font color=#000099> - </font><a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/bclanbloodtalon32452">Clan Bloodtalon Page</a><font color=#000099> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
