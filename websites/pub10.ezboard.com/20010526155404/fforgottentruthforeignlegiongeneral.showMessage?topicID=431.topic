Long but worth the read.</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Well, today I actually got out from behind my computer and the Distance Learning CD I am writing for my company to save an office. This was a HUGH sale for a very upscale dentist office in the Wedgewood area of Fort Worth. The client was difficult so they sent me to do the training.<br>
<br>
Now, my fellow trainers are all good...but they started as Hygenists and Dental Assistants ... not trainers. So, when a tough office comes up they send me. <br>
<br>
Anyway, this was a coat and tie type office so I dressed to the max, leather briefcase and all. It took a bit but I won them over and had two teams of students working away when this lady stumbled into the office. She asked me in a slurred voice if the Doctor was available so I went to the operatory and informed him he had a patient. Well, this guy is kind of crusty and blunt and begins to mumble about patients who walk-in when the office is closed etc. but he heads to the front desk anyway. As soon as he sees this patient his whole attitude changes. He calls and has his wife, who is a dental assistant come up while the patient explains her needs. They quickly wisk her into an operatory all the while acting like this woman is as fragile as an egg.<br>
<br>
The Doctor called me into the operatory to help since he was going to have to use the new dental equipment and software right then and had not completed the training, so I gloved-up and went in. We started with a full mouth x-ray series using his new digital x-ray system caled Gendix that snaps a shot and downloads to your screen in about 5 seconds. The x-rays displayed and even I could tell there were MAJOR problems with this patients mouth. I could see a variety of masses on the screen as well as several deep abscess pockets right down to the bone. We then used an interal oral camera for a better look. By now the Doctor's wife has tears just streaming down her face and the Doctor's voice is breaking as he tried to control his emotions. I'm a bit perplexed as her mouth is indeed a mess but nothing to cry about...or so I think.<br>
<br>
When we began using the camera the patient began to really shows signs of discomfort. It took me only 1 second to understand. Her lower jaw was completely encapsulated by cancerous tumors. This poor woman had to be in agony yet she barely moved or cried out. I knew she was wearing a wig but now things really began to click.<br>
<br>
This is a young lady, 28 years old, who gave birth to twin girls in October. Her husband died in early July in a boating accident. She has no family, no relatives, and few friends as they moved to Texas in June of last year for his new job. This beautiful young woman is dieing from cancer and probably has about 2 months left to live. The cancer was diagnosed in November and was just moving so fast there is really nothing that can be done. She is going through radiation therapy but with the hope that it will give her more time not that it can save her. The cancer has spread into her sinus cavities and working into her optic nerves. She has already lost her sense of taste and smell, her vision is going rapidly. Her hearing will be next as it continues to spread into her brain.<br>
<br>
We completed the exam and drained off the infection ... a process she goes through 3 times a week now. The Doctor complete his work, gave her a hug and then had his wife escort her to the front. I was just in shock as I took in all this information. This mean and demanding old Doctor stood there in tears as he asked if he could dictate his clinical notes to me as he couldn't type due to his hands shaking so much. As I entered her clinical notes I felt like I was passing a death sentence over her. It was THE hardest thing I have ever done reviewing those notes and adding a new entry.<br>
<br>
It really makes you stop and wonder about life and how you view other people. Here I assumed that this Doctor and his wife were demanding self centered people out to make a buck...but what I was realy seeing was their frustration in themselves for feeling they couldn't do enough for their patients.<br>
<br>
Now I'm sitting her with tears in my eyes knowing that I've wasted so much time in my own life, knowing that I've spent so many hours moaning about petty things, while this young woman would give the world to just have 1 of my wasted hours...1 more hour to say good-bye to two beautiful little girls that will grow-up never knowing who their Momma really was.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#6B8E23><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Wamba</FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Unregistered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>1/6/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>1:14:21 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=431.topic&index=1><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Reply</FONT></A></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">reply</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Do not kick yourself too hard, friend Crow, for getting wrapped up into the day-to-day petty problems that add stress to our lives.

We all need to remind ourselves from time to time to relax and enjoy life.  Enjoy what we have, here and now.  Because we can take nothing for granted.<br>
We are currently troubled by the frightnening condition of one of our own Foreign Legion family members.  There is very little that we can do in this matter (as in so many others), other than give out our best wishes........and try to enjoy what time we have.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=95%><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT></TD><TD ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showMessage?topicID=429.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1><< Prev Topic</FONT></A> &nbsp;<A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showMessage?topicID=426.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Next Topic >></FONT></A> </TD></TR></TABLE><BR><TABLE WIDTH=95% BORDER=0><TR><TD><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=431.topic&index=1><IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/addReply1.gif border=0></A></TD><TD><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=431.topic><IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/images/email.gif BORDER=0 ALT="Email This To a Friend"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Email This To a Friend</FONT><BR><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.threadControl?topicID=431.topic><IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/deleteThreadFire.gif BORDER=0 ALT="Topic Control Image"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Topic Commands (Moderator only)</FONT><BR><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=431.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Subscribe</FONT></A>  <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Click to receive email notification of replies</FONT><BR><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=431.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Unsubscribe</FONT></A>  <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</FONT><BR></TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3 ALIGN=CENTER><BR><FORM ACTION=http://pub10.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum METHOD=POST><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Jump to: </FONT><SELECT NAME=forumName><OPTION VALUE=forgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral>General<OPTION VALUE=forgottentruthforeignlegionlinks>Links<OPTION VALUE=forgottentruthforeignlegionmembers>Members<OPTION VALUE=forgottentruthforeignlegionquotes>Quotes<OPTION VALUE=forgottentruthforeignlegionfrm4>Uber Loot</SELECT><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE=Go></FORM></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><CENTER><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>- </FONT><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bforgottentruthforeignlegion><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Forgotten Truth Foreign Legion</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0> - </FONT><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>General</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0> - </FONT><A HREF=http://ftfl.iwarp.com/index.html><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Home</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0> - </FONT></B></CENTER><P><BR><CENTER><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.free-irewards.com/cgi-bin/ezboard/games.html?id=ouuIcESe" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/banners/iRewards120x30-08.gif"></a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><IMG SRC="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/serve?bfmid=7279965&siteid=33932331&bfpage=expertc_tax" BORDER="0" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" NOSAVE >
