I offered to share my loot with you but you refused; maybe it was not good enough for you. I also offered to replace what you had lost, but you said it was nothing of importance. If you wanted to go back and get your stuff and get a pick at the overlord chest, why didn'y you say so? When Roy died, he made it clear he wanted to go back and we did.<br>

I was talking about not having the chance to be a part of the FIRST STONE QUEST FOR US!! Doesn't matter what stone. Who cares that I want an acid stone. I have NEVER ONCE put my own needs in front of ANYONES in our little family. I don't work that way. So if you think it's all about lost loot then you have missed the entire point. The message can be found by reading BETWEEN the lines Dia. If you add missing out on a major event for us coupled with the events of the last quest then you might understand. Tell you what...forget the entire thing Dia. And forget Crow. I'm tired of this. Now I know why they say wearing a crown is the worse weight in the world ... it truly can be a burden.

I understand that you are disappointed my friend, and it was unfortunate, but I am certain that Dia and Frod would not PURPOSELY do you wrong.  It was a spur of the moment decision.  I hope that our 2 years of friendship as a group can help you to overlook their hasty decision.<br>

I know nothing was done to hurt me on purpose nor was any decision made along the lines of &quot;Lets go on this quest while Crow is away.&quot; If my comments were taken that way then it is my fault for not being more clear. I would never think that anyone should wait to do something they wanted to do in a game just because myself or any one else for that matter was unavailable. My original comments were made because I was frustrated that my schedule does not allow me to be in game more often to participate in these major events. Going as a group to get Celeroy's stone was something I was looking forward to since Raven helped make the atlan claw I wanted to be present to see it powered up. However, I didn't mean that anyone had to wait until I was available to go for the stone. Like I said, I was disappointed that I couldn't be part of the event. That, coupled with the fact that I missed out on the ravenous katar quest, died several times during the overlord quest, lost my high value death items and didn't get any loot off the overlord to take the sting out of the situation was very frustrating! I think that anyone would feel that way. My original post was not a slam at Roy or Dia for going on the stone quest. Glad you got it. However, several things added up to my disappointment and frustration and I felt comfortable venting those feelings in this forum. I think Celeroy knew exactly where I was coming from and how I ment the post. Not as a slam against anyone. That being said ... knowing that some think I am being petty, don't understand me after well over a year of interaction and friendship, and think I scorned their offer of gifts ... well, that hurts. Like I said, I don't think I have ever put my gaming needs in front of anyone. Even though I spend my own money on my account, I make sure everyone I know has anything they could possibly need from me if I am able to supply it. Example: Who was one of the last to get a quest bow? Crow was. Why? Because he GLADLY donated his supplies to others because they wanted the bow ... it made them happy ... it made their gaming experience more enjoyable and thus Crow enjoyed doing it.<br>
Dia wanted that overlord ... I wanted to help because it was something she wanted. I willing died several times for the mission because everyone was having fun and I was happy that they were having fun. I lost my stuff late in the night and didn't want to impose on anyone to go get in at such a late hour because then the mission might have gone from fun to a chore and I didn't want the night to end that way. I didn't get any loot but the enjoyment of being with my friends was more valuable than any loot. Then I found out I missed out on the stone quest for Roy after I spent time researching the mission and helping make the claw. It was then I started feeling frustrated. Maybe it's my own fault. If I didn't try to help, care or give what I could then missing the quest probably wouldn't mean anything to me. But because I do care, have given anything and everything I have for the enjoyment of others and in turn my own enjoyment - well, I guess that is why I felt the way I did and posted what I wrote. Like I said, it's probably my own fault. However, if people really don't know me or understand me after all this time then maybe it is time for me to move on.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR></TABLE>
