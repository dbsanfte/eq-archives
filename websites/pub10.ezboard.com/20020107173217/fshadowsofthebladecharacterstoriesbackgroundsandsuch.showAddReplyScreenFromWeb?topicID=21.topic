It was a girl, no more than five years old, with silver hair and indigo skin, wearing a frilly grey nightgown. She moved on silent feet and held a troll rag doll tight in one small hand. <br>
<br>
Though she had never met these people she knew who they were. Xosha, assassin and Hand of the Matron of the Shadows of the Blade and Xeylie, a young cleric who hoped to join the powerful guild. She did not know if they knew her, but she knew they would not be meeting her on this night. <br>
<br>
She regarded the sleeping women thoughtfully and grinned as she noticed the shiney rings on the rogue's relaxed hands. The child, still holding her toy, carefully slipped several of the prettiest jewelled rings off Xosha's slender hands and crept away again, silent as a mouse.... <br>

She, at the age of seven, still lived in her family's home, not in the guild house of the profession chosen for her by her elders. Nor was her upbringing left to anonymous caregivers, directed by cold and distant parents. <br>
<br>
Instead Tysh lived in a house full of affection and laughter, a rarity in any part of the Teir'dal city. She had a gentle, doting mother and a playful father. When they were away she was left in the care of the house Necromancer, who adored the child in his own strange way and acted as a surrogate grandfather to the child, teaching her as he had once taught her father. The child had even won the heart's of the House W'Rath's servants, who let her keep any treats her nimble little fingers managed to get a hold of. <br>
<br>
Nor was Tyshalae cloistered away in her home. She had been wandering the twisted streets of Neriak on her own for many moons, since she had first snuck out of the W'Rath compound. Tysh had followed Khevost, a favourite servant, out of the house and on his errands for her father and the necromancer, committing the layout of the city to memory. She and her troll rag-doll regularly wandered the streets, filching treats and shiny trinkets from the shopkeepers. Her parents had quickly discovered it was impossible to keep her from wandering and instead attempted to instill several important rules into her young mind. <br>
<br>
Tyshalae, unlike most Teir'dal her age, had little thought for her future role in life. She was only dimly aware of the fact that she was a Noble of the Respected Race and would be expected to follow a dignified path. None of her family's chosen roles held much interest for her. She did not have the stomach for gore that Momma and Papa Sol had, so Assassin and Necromancer were out of the question. She would never be muscular like Daddy with her thin frame, so his dream of a little Warrior would not be fulfilled with his first born. She had no love of the Gods thanks to her family's rather lax religious beliefs, so she would never hear the call of Innoruk like Momma's friend Yathrin. Tysh had no clue what the mad Talimar did, save that he always had candies hidden in the pockets of his brightly coloured robes for her. <br>
<br>
Her main goal for the future at this point in her young life was to see the forest. Tysh had heard stories of it, but had never managed to see it. She'd once made it all the way to the exit of the city and had seen the huge trees and strange mists when a guard picked her up by the back of her tunic and sent her home. <br>
<br>
The forest was her goal on this day, like many others. Tyshalae slowly snuck from shadow to shadow, hiding expertly at her tender age. As she made her way through the city she noticed that a particular Teir'dal was often in the same area as she was. He wore a robe like Talimar or Papa Sol, but looked similar to stern-faced General Zirrix, a friend of her parents whom she had just recently met when she tried to sneak into some boring meeting of Momma and Daddy's that was keeping them from home. <br>
<br>
She froze when she realized he was looking straight at her, though she knew she was well hidden. He walked towards her and spoke in a soft voice. &quot;Child, what do you know of the Magic Arts?&quot; <br>
<br>
Though she had ignored everything her parents had told her about not wandering off and not stealing, she remembered one important rule: Never talk to strangers. Tyshalae was running as fast as her long legs could go before the man had finished his sentence and did not slow until the gates of House W'Rath were in sight. <br>
<br>
When she entered the library, shaken but not afraid, the old Necromancer looked up at her with a slight smile on his face. &quot;Nice stroll child?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Ummm, yes Papa Sol.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Would you like me to read to you?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yay,&quot; she squealed, climbing into the aged dark elf's lap. <br>
<br>
As she happily listened to the grim children's stories of the Teir'dal, her encounter with the strange man was quickly forgotten, though some small part of her childish mind knew this would not be the last that she saw of him. <br>

She slowly crept towards the empty kitchen and hid in a cupboard. She then heard footsteps nearing her hiding place. The child became as still as a statue. <br>
<br>
&quot;Where is that Innoruuk damned child?&quot; a slightly sinister female voice demanded. <br>
<br>
&quot;She has to be somewhere,&quot; a male answered. <br>
<br>
&quot;We will find her,&quot; another male answered, this voice sounding even more sinister than the woman's. <br>
<br>
They left the room and Tyshalae relaxed. Perhaps they would give up their search soon and she could escape.... Then she heard soft chanting and an eerie, almost musical sound. Tysh recognized the sound of spell casting and backed even further into her corner. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hmmmm.&quot; The cupboard opened and an aged Teir'dal peered in. &quot;What a mess,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;I am not touching that.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Dantrazz, I've found your daughter,&quot; he shouted, smiling at the child he had helped raise. <br>
<br>
&quot;Papa Sol! No. Don't let them get me!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Hush child, it is for your own good.&quot; <br>
<br>
The girl looked at her surrogate grandfather and pouted. &quot;I hate you,&quot; she mumbled. <br>
<br>
&quot;No you don't.&quot; Solaufein said, remembering similar incidents involving a very young Dantrazz. <br>
<br>
Another face joined the necromancer's. Long suffering crimson eyes met Tysh's and the handsome lips turned to a frown. &quot;She looks all sticky,&quot; Dantrazz muttered, staring at his daughter. The warrior then reached in and grabbed the squirming child. &quot;C'mon mouse, no one's going to hurt you.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;No Daddy, no! Momma's going to kill me!&quot; <br>
<br>
Dantrazz shrugged. &quot;Maybe.... Now quit wiggling.&quot; <br>
<br>
The warrior carried her up a long flight of stairs and into a small room lit with candles. It smelled of exotic incense and the air was humid. Morrigu stood within, grinning evilly at her only child. In her hand she held the object Tyshalae feared most. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hold her down love,&quot; she said softly, placing her weapon on a small table. As the strong warrior held the child immobile, the assassin pulled her clothing off. &quot;Throw her in,&quot; she whispered, indicating a cauldron of steaming liquid. <br>
<br>
&quot;No, Momma. Nooooo!&quot; The child was immersed in the warm scented water and screamed as Morrigu slid the little bar of soap over her indigo skin. <br>
<br>
&quot;You know, this wouldn't be so bad if you didn't get so dirty so fast.... Ick, your all slimy like a troll,&quot; Morrigu said as she started to clean off the layer of grime that was covering her daughter's soft indifo skin. <br>
<br>
&quot;Speaking of trolls....&quot; Dantrazz peeled a grungy little troll rag-doll off his tunic and dropped it. Tysh grabbed for it, but missed, and Quashie joined her in the bubbly water. <br>
<br>
&quot;Good idea Dan, Quashie was almost as grimy as she was.... Hold still little Feir'dal!&quot; Morrigu said, trying to grab the slippery child. <br>
<br>
Tysh turned and looked at her mother, pouting. &quot;I am not a wood elf.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;You smell like one right now Tysh,&quot; her mother said gently. <br>
<br>
Tysh settled down at this point, remembering Papa Sol's stories about the creatures of Norrath. She decided that perhaps the only thing worse than being a wood elf was being mistaken for one. She then smiled at her parents and threw her Quashie doll into the air with a giggle, letting him slash in the water. <br>
<br>
&quot;Good Tysh,&quot; Morrigu smiled. &quot;Do you want some candy?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yay!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Stay still and I'll give you some.&quot; <br>
<br>
Tysh smiled at her mother, and accepted the bribe. &quot;Okies Momma.&quot; <br>
<br>
Tyshalae planned her next adventure as she let Morrigu wash her long silvery hair. She had noticed an interesting pile of muck down the street just before the dreaded bath was mentioned. If it was still there later she and Quashie would have to investigate.... <br>

It is time for you to be sleeping.&quot; Morrigu pulled the warm quilt up to Tyshalae's chin and kissed her on the forehead. &quot;Night baby.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Night Momma,&quot; the child said, yawning happily. Dantrazz and Mourn entered the darkened bedroom as Morrigu left. <br>
<br>
&quot;Bye little minx,&quot; Mourn said with a grin. &quot;See you when I get back from the Overthere.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Bye Uncle,&quot; she whispered with a smile. <br>
<br>
Dantrazz sat on the small bed and ruffled the child's silky white hair. &quot;I'm going away for a little while too Tysh. I'll bring you back something for your birthday though. What do you want?&quot; <br>
<br>
Tysh thought for a moment, then remembered the creature she had seen one of the other noble children playing with a few days earlier. &quot;A kitten!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I'll see what I can do. I love you Tysh,&quot;she said kissing her smooth indigo cheek. <br>
<br>
&quot;Love you too Daddy.&quot; Tyshalae hugged her father and waved as he left the room. <br>
<br>
She then closed her eyes and pretended to sleep. After a few moments her bedroom door opened again. Tysh kept her eyes closed knowing that this last visitor was shy. Her bed shifted slightly as someone very thin sat on it. A dry hand stroked her face for a moment, then receded. <br>
<br>
&quot;Sleep well my little one,&quot; Solaufein whispered. He left the room as quietly as he had entered. <br>
<br>
&quot;Night Papa Sol,&quot; she whispered to the dark. <br>
<br>
Tysh waited a few more minutes and then sat up. She swung her feet onto the floor and dug her rag-doll out from under the covers. &quot;It sounds like they've all gone to bed Quashie,&quot;she whispered, looking seriously at the small green troll.&quot;Now we can play.&quot; <br>
<br>
Tysh went to her closet and dug around for a bit. From a box for toys she pulled out a tiny outfit of leather armour she had sewn. She carefully put this on Quashie. <br>
<br>
Tysh then took out a child sized suit of leather armour that her parents had gotten Cayla, the maidservant who was helping teach Tysh things like sewing, to make for their child after it became evident that she could not be stopped from wandering out in to the forest on her own. Tysh pulled the supple armour, of a more modest cut than the leathers that adult female Teir'dal wore, on to her skinny frame and smiled at her reflection in her mirror. <br>
<br>
She then rummaged around in her red treasure sack and pulled out a dagger she had borrowed from her Momma's equipment rack earlier that day and put it on her belt. Tysh tucked Quashie in a special pocket sewn on to her tunic and grinned. <br>
<br>
The child opened her bedroom window and breathed in the scent of Neriak. The air was cool and moist and a slight mist was suspended in it, dampening sound and decreasing visibility. Tysh climbed out her window and scaled down the wall to the street. She landed like a cat. <br>
<br>
Tonight she was trying an experiment. If she failed, well she was only seven and a noble so nothing bad would really happen. If she was successful.... <br>
<br>
Several days earlier Morrigu had dragged her entire family to another noble's house for some sort of party. The males of the household had gone only reluctantly, though Tysh was excited at first. She had vague memories of several of her own birthday parties and figured that even if she was not getting any presents at least there would be sweets. <br>
<br>
Tysh had changed her mind about the affair quite swiftly. The really long bath and scratchy little dress were bad enough, but constantly being shushed by strangers, not being allowed to touch anything and the overall lack of anything good to eat made up her mind. She was about to go find her Daddy and Uncle when she noticed the guest of honour. <br>
<br>
The party was to celebrate the coming of age of a young noblewoman. The girl herself was somewhat ugly. (Papa Sol had said some of the nobles were ugly due to inbreeding, whatever that was.) Around her throat the ugly girl wore a choker unlike any piece of jewellery Tysh had ever seen. It was shinny gold, set with gems in almost every colour the child could imagine. Many of the adults at the party apparently thought it was quite a tasteless piece of jewellery, and Tysh was inclined to agree. But she thought the stones were beautiful. <br>
<br>
For the rest of the party Tyshalae wandered around the great house quietly. She looked in rooms and peered at window casings. The few adults who noticed her activities merely shooed her away, mumbling about &quot;those odd W'Rath people.&quot; Tysh did as she was told and after a while went to find her family.... <br>
<br>
The house Tysh stood before was made of large stones roughly mortared together. It was quite lovely to look at, but the architect obviously did not know any Rogues. Tyshalae climbed up the side of the building to the third floor. She edged along a convenient ledge to a window with frilly lavender curtains. <br>
<br>
&quot;We have to be very quiet now Quashie,&quot; she whispered, pulling up the window just a bit. The skinny girl slid in through the opening and landed silently on the thick carpet. Tyshalae scanned the room, finding what she sought just a few feet away. As she had hoped the girl did not wear the necklace to bed. Instead it was on a wooden stand shaped like a lady's neck and shoulders so the soft gold would keep its shape. This stand was on the girl's night table. <br>
<br>
Tysh crept across the carpet and to the table. She took the necklace off its stand and wrapped it carefully in a silk scarf that she had found on the floor. The child then stuffed her prize into a belt pouch. She moved silently to the window and slipped out again, closing it behind her. The girl had not even snored while Tysh was there. <br>
<br>
Tyshalae made her way back home quickly, avoiding all the patrolling guards and the few late night wanderers. The child climbed up to her room and changed back into her frilly nightie. She placed her treasure under her pillow. Tysh planned on prying the jewels out of the setting in the morning, and selling the gold to one of the nice trollie ladies in the Foreign Quarter. <br>
<br>
&quot;You're a good assistant thief for a trollie,&quot; Tysh whispered. She kissed Quashie's soft fabric face and smiled. Tyshalae heard footsteps in the hall and quickly feigned sleep. The door opened and someone entered her room. <br>
<br>
&quot;Silly child,&quot; the old Necromancer whispered. There was a slight clicking sound. &quot;If she doesn't start remembering to lock her window, someone's going to break in.&quot; Solaufein briefly touched her hair, not noticing the dampness from the night air that clung to it and left the room once more. <br>
<br>
Tysh suppressed a giggle, then touched her new treasure once more. She hugged Quashie tight and then fell asleep for real, a slight smile on her small lips. <br>

Tyshalae was out in the forest, not hunting so much as wasting time. She had successfully escaped from a bath and figured she should avoid home for a little while. Tysh was in her customary spot on the log, helping those older than her in years, though not experience fight off beetles and wolves. <br>
<br>
As she killed a great spider for an arrogant young Necromancer she heard a commotion. There was a woman in the forest, shouting that she was to see the King and wished to have followers in her quest. Tysh's ears perked up and she made her way to the shouter. <br>
<br>
A Teir'Dal woman, dressed in black chain-mail like Tysh's Momma. Her name was Tsajin, and the King of Neriak had demanded her presence. Tysh ducked through the crowd, using her small stature to her advantage, and found herself standing beside the sinister looking woman. <br>
<br>
&quot;You've come to help me, child? Go home to your dollies,&quot; Tsajin sneered. Tysh sneered right back of course. <br>
<br>
The crowd moved to the Foreign Quarter and the King appeared. He was tall and dressed in armour like her Daddy's, save that it was dark, not bight and shinny. The High Cleric of Innoruuk stood beside the King. These three great figures argued among themselves. A smelly old book of some sort was to be found in Lavastorm and the dark lady would be rewarded if she found it. <br>
<br>
Tsajin led the grown ups out in to the Forest, leaving Tysh alone with the King. She fidgeted for a moment and then smiled at the man, hoping he would give her some candy. &quot;Ummm, hi your Majesty.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Greetings child. Are you loyal to your King?&quot; he asked. <br>
<br>
Tysh hesitated. She had no reason not to be loyal she supposed. &quot;Uhuh.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Then why did you not go with the others?&quot; <br>
<br>
Tysh stared up at the man and frowned. &quot;I'm too little.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Nay, follow along, make sure that Tsajin woman does her duty. I do not trust her.&quot; <br>
<br>
Tysh shrugged. &quot;Ok.&quot; She wandered out in to the forest and hid, not wanting to risk the ire of the King or her family. Tysh knew if her Momma ever found out she was in Lavastorm before she turned sixteen her Momma would have Papa Sol skin her alive or something equally unpleasant. But she had also learned to not outright disobey people in front of their noses. It was fine to do whatever you wanted behind their backs, Mommas and Kings included. <br>
<br>
After a time Tsajin and her hoard returned. Tysh quickly joined the group and followed to Third Gate. The King and his Rogue met. She refused to give up the book, demanding a tenth of the city's treasure first. The King became angered and killed her, taking the book from her dead hands. Tysh suppressed a shriek during al this, quietly wiping a bit of the dead woman's blood from her face. She wanted to go home, but was swept up in the crowd once again. They went deeper in to the Noble Quarter, stopping at the river. The King, his Cleric and a young Prophet swam to the conical island with in the river warning all others to stay back. Two young women waited on the island, a Dark Elf and a High Elf. <br>
<br>
The Dark Elf came up to the King, face etched with an expression of pure ecstasy. He drove a sword through her and the crowd cheered. Tysh felt her stomach churn. <br>
<br>
Next the king turned to the light dweller. Tysh was very unsure about her feelings towards the High Elves. She supposed she did not mind the Wood Elves, even if they did smell funny. They gave her candy and made her run very fast. High Elves were always rude to the child though. But she could not help feeling bad for this young elf. She was barely older than Tysh and screaming to be rescued. Tyshalae watched as one caster tried to save the girl, but she was slain instantly by the High Cleric. The King then killed the girl and the crowd cheered again. <br>
<br>
Then they became silent. A disgusting smelling wind started blowing and the air shimmered.... At the top of the island a creature had appeared. Tall and ugly, covered in warts and with horns on its head. His limbs were twisted and his eyes burned with evil. Shouts of &quot;Innoruuk bless us&quot; and &quot;Hail the Avatar of Hate&quot; could be heard. <br>
<br>
So this is our God, Tysh thought, a crippled old monster with body odour. She shrugged, Yathrin and the others could worship this beast, Tysh preferred to depend on her self. <br>
<br>
The God's avatar started screaming and the young Prophet listened intently, hoping to translate its words for the King. Tysh fidgeted, this was beginning to bore her. Then some fool in the crowd cast a spell on the Avatar. It screamed even louder and lunged into the crowd. Tysh could have reached her hand out and touched its disgusting blue-green skin. Instead she screamed and started running.... Tysh slowed a block from her home and calmly entered her home. Papa Sol was waiting by the door. <br>
<br>
&quot;Are the half wits enjoying their show?&quot; he asked grinning. Tysh nodded, frowning. <br>
<br>
&quot;I trust you are not converting little one?&quot; he asked gently. <br>
<br>
&quot;No way,&quot; Tysh said. &quot;He smelled bad.... And the way everyone was acting, that is what I hate about our people.... I think I want that bath now Papa Sol. I feel icky.&quot; <br>
<br>
The old Necromancer smiled gently at the child. &quot;Those people make me feel the same way child.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Why is Auntie Yathy different from them? She's a priestess of that creature,&quot; Tysh asked, holding the old Dark Elf's hand. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yathrin is just different child. Cherish those differences, do not question them. Come, your mother will be pleased to see you requesting a bath for once.&quot; <br>
<br>
Tysh grinned. &quot;This will be the only time it happens, believe me Papa Sol.&quot; Both laughed and like all the bad things that had ever happened to the small girl, the fear she had felt earlier was quickly forgotten. <br>
<br>

The air in the great city's caverns was pleasantly warm and a little damp, protected from the extremes of weather of the world outside was subject to. Third Gate was, as usual, brimming with activity. Well-dressed matrons returning from morning services at the Spires or going shopping. Servants running errands, children playing solemn games of &quot;smite the light crawler.&quot; <br>
<br>
In front of one great house a solitary child played. Tyshalae and her Quashie doll sat on the curb outside House W'Rath. The girl was chattering happily and perforating a recently decreased rat with a shinny dagger. Tysh had been eight years old for just over a day. When she had wakened the day before she had experienced the usual disappointment of not feeling any different on her birthday, but quickly got over it. Her Daddy and uncle Mourn would be returning home and she would get presents and sweets. <br>
<br>
Her Momma had originally been planning a great party of nobles for that evening, but had changed her mind rather quickly. It seemed that every time there was a noble gathering in recent months the host was robbed rather efficiently right afterwards. Tysh did not bother mentioning that she was the one doing the robbing, for she had no desire to spend her birthday in a itchy little dress listening to boring old nobles. Instead Morrigu planned a luncheon for family and friends. <br>
<br>
Tysh had gorged on all her favourite savouries and sweets, then got presents. Armour and daggers and lockpicks, rings and skulls and toys. The best gift was from her Daddy. Tysh had her heart set on a kitten, a cuddly little puff of fur. Her daddy carried a rather large wooden box over to her, grinning. Tysh had found her kitten inside, one almost of big as she was. <br>
<br>
&quot;It's a Sabertooth from the Overthere,&quot; he explained smiling. <br>
<br>
&quot;Sweet Innoruuk,&quot; Momma gasped. &quot;This creature's going to be the bane of our lives,&quot; thus christening the kitten. <br>
<br>
The giggling Necromancer, Oifur Moy'fur, the cast a spell on child, kitten and rag-doll, letting them fly through the house.... It had been the best birthday ever in Tysh's opinion. <br>
<br>
Now Tysh was testing out her new weapons and armour. Bane the kitten had to stay inside, for Momma was afraid he might try to eat one of the neighbourhood children. Tysh saw this as no great loss, but behaved for once. <br>
<br>
Tysh giggled as she poked the rat, spilling its innards in to the gutter. Quashie grinned appreciatively beside her. She then gasped as she felt staring eyes on her. A Teir'dal man was walking up the street towards her, a strange grin on his lips. <br>
<br>
&quot;Greetings child.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Ummmm, hello,&quot; Tysh mumbled, hiding her dagger beside her and stuffing Quashie into his special belt pouch. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;You are the W'Rath child, aren't you?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Ummmm.&quot; Tysh knew she wasn't to talk to strangers and stayed silent. <br>
<br>
&quot;You are. There are many in Neriak who want to teach you the right path child, to free you from the corruptness of your family. There are others who just want to play,&quot; he said, leering at her skinny young form. <br>
<br>
&quot;Don't you touch me,&quot; Tyshalae hissed. <br>
<br>
&quot;Come child, you like to play.&quot; He reached for her delicate shoulder. <br>
<br>
Tysh reacted quickly, remembering all her lessons from Momma and Daddy. She gashed the man's hand with the tip of her dagger then quickly dodged behind him. She drove her dagger into the back of his knee. The man fell with a moan and a curse. Tysh then kicked him in the groin and face with her pointy boots several times and stomped on his throat for good measure. <br>
<br>
Tysh knelt by the man's unmoving form and tugged on her dagger. It was stuck, caught on some bone or something. She frowned and looked up at the house. &quot;You stay here bad man,&quot; she hissed. <br>
<br>
Tysh stepped into the house and contemplated who to get. Momma and Daddy were having what Papa Sol called &quot;grown up time&quot; and were not to be bothered. Uncle Mourn would still be sleeping. She knew Papa Sol would be able to get her dagger back and wandered down the stairs to his study. <br>
<br>
&quot;What is it little one?&quot; he asked softly, looking up from an old book. <br>
<br>
&quot;My dagger....&quot; <br>
<br>
He frowned. &quot;Lost already?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;No, stuck.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Where child?&quot; <br>
<br>
Tysh grabbed his hand. &quot;Come with me Papa Sol,&quot; she said and led him outside. She pointed at the man. &quot;In his knee Papa Sol.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What did he do to you?&quot; the old Necromancer whispered, staring at the limp figure's disfigured face. <br>
<br>
&quot;He tried to touch me,&quot; she mumbled. &quot;I think he wanted to do bad things to me&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I see,&quot; he whispered, stroking the child's soft silvery hair. He knelt by the man and felt a faint pulse. Sol then pulled her dagger out of the man's knee and cleaned it on his robe. &quot;Here you go, my little one. You go inside and play with Quashie and Bane. I will clean this up.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Okies Papa Sol,&quot; Tysh said, hugging the Necromancer for just a second. She ran inside and found her kitten. Tysh, the kitten and Quashie then invented fun new games with lots for giggling, purring and clawing. By the time strange gurgling noises started echoing through the house from Papa Sol's lab in the basement, Tysh had forgotten her earlier fear. She barely noticed the noises or that they abruptly stopped. <br>
<br>
&quot;C'mon Quashie,&quot; Tysh said merrily, dangling her rag-doll by one little green arm. &quot;Let's find out if kittens like candy!&quot; Child, doll and kitten ran for the kitchen, trailing destruction in their wake. <br>
<br>
All was well within House W'Rath. <br>

He finally shrugged and moved towards the door, unlocking it and quickly moving in to the dank little room. Tyshalae followed him, stifling a giggle. The guard sat in a chair and nodded to the guards who were leaving. His partner was almost always an hour or so late. Tysh hoped today would not be an exception. <br>
<br>
He picked up a cheap book full of drawings of various types of naked female elves and started grinning. Tysh then turned her attention to the prisoner in the room's tiny cell. <br>
<br>
Lanneth Shadowborn, Half-elf ranger, was asleep, leaning against the bars of his barren cell. Tysh had been sneaking here and watching him for almost a week, since the day she and Auntie Mystie had seen him dragged through Neriak in chains. The wounded mess of his eye was looking better on this day, though there was a new gash on one fair cheek. Tysh felt some pity for him. He was only a little older than she was and had been caught doing something braver than she would ever do. <br>
<br>
The guard started snoring and Tysh grinned. She pulled her troll rag-doll from his special pouch. &quot;Well Quashie, guess we're gonna have to wake him.&quot; She grasped Quashie around his plump cloth body and swiftly thwacked the sleeper in the head. The toy's small metal helmet connected with skull and the Ranger awoke with a start. <br>
<br>
&quot;Who?&quot; he mumbled, staring at the young Dark Elf. <br>
<br>
&quot;Who the Hell were you expecting? Tuna Air?&quot; She had heard the curse word in the Foreign Quarter and was trying to use it as much as possible, away from the ears of family and guild of course. <br>
<br>
&quot;No, I guess not,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Well, who are you?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Not important. I'm a friend of some of your friends Lanneth. They're worried ‘bout you.&quot; He nodded. &quot;I've been keepin' an eye on ya for the last week.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;That so?&quot; he whispered, probably amazed that a child so young could make her way into the bowels of the prison on her own. <br>
<br>
&quot;You can trust me Pinky,&quot; Tysh said, pointing to the guild pin on her chain mail tunic. &quot;Evoluxa does.&quot; She pulled a small bag out of her back pack. &quot;Food, water and bandages. Looks like you could use ‘em.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I could. And what do I tell the guards if they find it?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I dunno, say a mouse dragged it in. They'll beat the hell outta you if they find it no matter what you say.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, thank you Mouse.&quot; <br>
<br>
Tysh grinned. &quot;If you got a message you want to send anyone I'll be back tomorrow.&quot; She heard a nearby door open. &quot;I gotta go. I'd wish ya luck, but you're a Pinky and, well....&quot; She shrugged and slipped into the shadows by the door. <br>
<br>
A guard walked in, stared at Lanneth for a moment, a cruel smile on his indigo face, then moved to wake his friend. Tysh slipped out the briefly opened door. She then spent the better part of an hour working her way out of the prison. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well Quashie,&quot; she said, ginning at the stuffed troll, breathing in the damp air of Neriak. &quot;Guess we're gonna have to go shoppin' before we go back to Oasis.&quot; Tysh stared quizzically at the toy for a moment, as if listening. &quot;Yeah, I know I'm gettin' soft...all that peace an' love from the guild I guess. Let's go kill some halflings first, before we get to the lizzies. That'll straighten me up. I promised Daddy I wouldn't eat any of the guild and its been gettin' to me.&quot; <br>
<br>
She grinned, thinking of nothing more than fresh meat and started humming a happy little tune, imagining that Quashie was singing along with her, in a pleasantly deep trollish voice. <br>

There was no sign of her child in the narrow bed. On one half slept Bane, the giant kitten, and on the other half laid a variety of stuffed animals. The only thing that betrayed her child's existence was a stray lock of silvery hair. <br>
<br>
&quot;Caught you little Mouse,&quot; she said, smiling. <br>
<br>
Tyshalae sprung up, sending toys and one very big kitty flying. The child grinned and giggled, waving her rag-doll around happily. &quot;Mornin' Momma!&quot; <br>
<br>
Morrigu sat on the edge of her child's bed and ruffled her long silky hair. &quot;Papa Sol is busy this morning, so no lessons ‘till this afternoon. Do you want to go outside and play Tysh?&quot; <br>
<br>
Tysh grinned. &quot;Yay!&quot; She loved her lessons with Papa Sol, but there was something she needed hunt for in the city. <br>
<br>
Tysh pulled on regular play cloths, leather leggings and a big cotton tunic, instead of her armour, then followed her mother to the kitchen. Morrigu gave her a bottle of milk and several warm muffins. &quot;You be good.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Of course Momma,&quot; Tysh said, trying to look innocent. <br>
<br>
&quot;Right.&quot; Morrigu bent down and kissed her daughter on the forehead. <br>
<br>
&quot;Quashie said he wants a kiss too, Momma,&quot; the child giggled, holding the somewhat grungy toy in Morrigu's face. <br>
<br>
She looked at Tysh and grinned, then planted her sensuous lips on the rag-doll's bald green head. Morrigu watched as they ran out of the house and smiled, then set about her morning tasks. <br>
<br>
Tysh sat on the curb for a few moments and discussed today's plan with Quashie between bits of muffin. They were going to sneak into House D'Noir today. Rumour around the Foreign Quarter said that Matron Ferall had taken in an urchin and was nursing him back to health. Tysh knew the Matron was odd, but this merited further investigation. Everyone knew the proper thing to do with urchins was steam them lightly and eat them with butter sauce. <br>
<br>
They walked down the narrow street, then sneaked into an alley way. &quot;Be quiet now, Quashie,&quot; Tysh warned, tucking the toy into his special pouch. &quot;The skelly guards won't see us, but they can hear us.&quot; The child then sneaked through the fence, past the undead guards who remained after the second disappearance of their master and up the stone wall. <br>
<br>
Tysh crept along the narrow ledge and into an open window. She landed softly in a dark hallway. A door opened and the Matron and a serving girl left, closing the door softly behind them. <br>
<br>
&quot;That must be the urchin's room,&quot; Tysh whispered for Quashie's benefit, as he could not see out of the belt pouch. The child crept into the room and regarded its occupant. A small, bruised Tier'dal boy laid in a large bed, thick blankets tucked all around him. His eyes were closed, but he sensed her presence somehow. <br>
<br>
&quot;Who's there?&quot; he whispered in a soft, hoarse voice. <br>
<br>
Tysh moved to the bed and looked at him, smiling. &quot;I'm Tysh, who the Hell are you?&quot; <br>
<br>
The boy managed a grin. &quot;I'm Elil.... Why are you here?&quot; <br>
<br>
She shrugged. &quot;I'm lookin' for an urchin. You seen it? ‘Bout the size of an apple, kinda prickly, lives underwater?&quot; <br>
<br>
For some reason the boy, wounded and half starved as he was, started laughing. <br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot; Tysh stared at him, utterly confused. &quot;What the Hell is so funny?&quot; <br>
<br>
************ <br>
<br>
Tysh wandered into Papa Sol's study several hours later, Quashie swinging at her side, both humming a happy little song. <br>
<br>
&quot;I trust you had an enjoyable morning, little one?&quot; the old Necromancer said, looking up from his book. <br>
<br>
&quot;I did!&quot; she exclaimed, climbing on to a stool by her Papa's desk. &quot;I made a friend! Or at least I think I did. He didn't call me un-natch-eral or nothin' like the other kids do.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;That is pleasant indeed Tyshalae.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, but I never found Matron Ferall's sea urchin,&quot; she mumbled. <br>
<br>
The Necromancer looked at the child, puzzled. He had quite a bit of experience with young W'Raths and knew sometimes it was better for his sanity if he just did not ask. <br>

She then pulled her well-loved troll doll from his special pouch and grinned at him. <br>
<br>
&quot;Time to go home Quashie.&quot; She drank back a wolfie feets potion and started running. The journey from Lavastorm to Third Gate was a long one, but fast feets and a trollie's pleasant company made it go quite quickly. <br>
<br>
As she ran she heard distressing rumours of people just vanishing from the face of Norrath. Tysh shrugged and kept running. House W&quot;Rath was stronger than such things... besides her whole crazy extended family was meeting at her home that afternoon, for they had not seen each other for a while. Tysh decided to run faster, suddenly worries that they might think she was gone too. <br>
<br>
She rushed up to the door and burst in, grinning. &quot;I's here!&quot; She was meet only by Bane, making the heart wenching whine of a sad feline. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hello?&quot; Tysh shouted, suddenly scared. The child searched her home and found no one, no sign that the preparations for the party had even started. Even the servants were gone. <br>
<br>
She sat on her bed for a while and cried. Her whole family, Momma, Daddy, Papa Sol, Uncle Mourn, Auntie Mystie, Yathy and Oifie, seemed to be gone.... Tysh cried and cried, then started thinking. <br>
<br>
Her parents always stressed that she was not safe without them Neriak, for her House had many enemies. Tysh grabbed her red velvet sack and started packing her most treasured belongings in it. She found the leash and harness that she had crafted for Bane so he could go outside and play. She secured her sack to her back, drank a wolfie feets potion, fed another to her cat and started running. <br>
<br>
The girl and her pet ran for many miles, all the way to Oasis. They stopped at the docks. Tysh peered at a kindly looking dwarf and tried to smile. <br>
<br>
&quot;Mister, where do those raft thingies go?&quot; <br>
<br>
The old dwarf smiled at her gently and spoke in a voice like old leather. &quot;Goes to th' Bloated Belly lass. Th' boat to th' Overthere.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;That's very far from Neriak, right?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Aye lass, thou' th' rest of Kunark's even farther.&quot; <br>
<br>
Tysh looked and him and mustered a small smile. &quot;Thank you dwarfie.&quot; She then stepped off the dock and onto a waiting raft. <br>
<br>
&quot;Wait lass. Have ye no family?&quot; <br>
<br>
She looked at him, tears welling in her big green eyes. &quot;I don't think so....&quot; Tysh buried her face in Bane's good smelling fur and hugged Quashie close to her chest. She started crying again... bitter tears that stung her eyes and burned her throat. She was alone. <br>
<br>
***** <br>
<br>
Dantrazz, Morrigu and Sol entered their home and looked for any sign of life. Many of their friends, family and enemies had disappeared mysteriously and they were weary from searching. <br>
<br>
&quot;Tysh!&quot; Morrigu called. &quot;Come here Mouse.... You're not in trouble honey&quot; She collapsed on a couch, tears spilling from her crimson eyes. &quot;What if it got her too? She's just a baby....&quot; Dantrazz sat beside his love, holding her tight. Sol went to look for the child. <br>
<br>
He returned several minutes later, frowning. &quot;Tysh was here, but she gathered her things and left. She probably thought we too were gone and ran away. Even her cat is gone.&quot; <br>
<br>
Dantrazz growled softly, his eyes filled with pain. &quot;Then we will have to find her. She is our child and the future of this House.&quot; He hugged his wife tighter, trying to quell the shakes that ripples through her slender body. Dantrazz felt a cold hand on his shoulder and looked up into the old Necromancer's blue eyes, noticing that they were damp. <br>
<br>
&quot;We'll find you Mouse...&quot; he whispered, feeling warm liquid spill down his own scarred cheeks. <br>

Child, cat and rag-doll were living in an abandoned building, eating scraps stolen from unwary travellers.<br>
<br>
How long we been stuck here Quashie? Months? Years?&quot; Tysh counted in her head, frowning. &quot;Five days? Seems like longer. Overhere is the boringest place ever! I wish we could go home....&quot; Tysh felt tears pouring down her cheeks and hugged Quashie tighter.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mouse?&quot; A strong male voice erupted through the city. Tysh's ears perked up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tysh baby!&quot; A woman's voice now, filled with sorrow. The child's tears ran dry.<br>
<br>
&quot;Little one....&quot; This was another man, his voice a whisper more felt than heard. Tysh jumped up and ran out of the building, Quashie and her red sack clutched tight in her small indigo hands, Bane close at her heels.<br>
<br>
She ran out into the Dark Elf outpost and straight into a pair of armour clag legs. Tysh gasped, fearing it was one of the mean old guards and looked up, into a pair of crimson eyes. The child started crying again. <br>
<br>
&quot;Mouse,&quot; her Daddy whispered, smiling. Her Momma kneeled down and pulled Tysh into her arms. Daddy crouched down too, hugging both of them. Papa Sol stood beside them, stroking Tysh's tangled silver hair.<br>
<br>
&quot;We was lonely,&quot; the child said happily, even as tears continued to spill from her eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;So were we, little Mouse,&quot; Momma whispered, covering Tysh's face with gentle kisses.<br>
<br>
&quot;We was bored too.&quot; Tysh started giggling and her glee was infectious. <br>
<br>
For the first time in many hard and sorrowful days the remaining members of House W'Rath smiled.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/utyshalae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tyshalae</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_purplespot.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10> at: 11/1/00 1:44:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/utyshalae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tyshalae</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_purplespot.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Mouse</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#939393>(11/1/00 2:39:21 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/sbugelli/tyshface.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Eenie Beenie Halloweenie....</span><hr size=1> It was mid-Autumn. The leaves were changing colours and the wind was growing cold. The children of Freeport were growing anxious, for soon it would be their favourite event of the year. On the night that marked the exact middle of Autumn the children of the city dressed in costumes lovingly crafted by their mothers and took to the dark streets to beg for candy. Would be paladins, very short trolls and gleeful ghouls banded together to obtain the tummy ache inducing loot.  No one was sure when the custom started, but the was no similar tradition in any other city on Norrath.<br>
<br>
Two of the merchant women of the Commonlands were standing in front of their shops discussing their children's costumes as their coin purses and wedding rings mysteriously disappeared.... As Tyshalae inspected her finds she listened to the women talk. The child grinned as she carefully slipped one of the women's rings back on, unimpressed with the glass stone. <br>
<br>
Tysh hurried home and changed out of her shiny chainmail. She pulled on a pair of old leather legging and a comfy linen tunic.  She then messed up her hair and patted her indigo skin down with powder, making it look almost fake. Tysh then dumped out her red sack and tucked Quashie in her belt pouch so he wouldn't miss any of the fun. They snuck out of the house, undetected by parents and servants and started running to Freeport just before sunset.<br>
<br>
Tysh carefully neared the gates, trying to stay in the shadows so she could avoid the guards.<br>
<br>
&quot;Halt in the name of the Freeport Militia!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ohoh.&quot; Tysh stopped, terrified. &quot;We's in for it now Quashie,&quot; she whispered, clutching her rag-doll tight.<br>
<br>
&quot;What have we here?&quot; The guard held his lantern close to her face and grinned. &quot;Garth, ya gotta see this one!&quot; Another guard walked over, smiling.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello sweetie.... Nice job! What'd ya use?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Uhhhh,&quot; Tysh smiled. &quot;Momma's secret!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahhh, well off with ya sweetie, or ya'll miss your candy.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Okies!&quot; Tysh giggles and ran into a city. She found a group of children and wormed her way into their midst. <br>
<br>
The first home they stopped at did not impress Tysh; apples were dropped in their sacks and there were only cheap looking candle sticks on the mantle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where's the good stuff?&quot; Tysh asked after the door closed.<br>
<br>
&quot;First time?&quot; a chubby goblin asked.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Uhuh.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're the new kid from over by the blacksmith, right?&quot; a rather moth-eaten birdman inquired. Tysh smiled as a response. &quot;The bigger the home, the better the candy generally.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I love your costume,&quot; a sheet draped sorceress gushed. &quot;I went as am inkie last year. Ma mushed blueberries all over my face...I was blue for days. What your ma use?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, I's not sure,&quot; Tysh grinned. &quot;I's probably gonna be this way for a while.&quot;<br>
<br>
A tall kid dressed like a barbarian laughed. &quot;My grandpa says they should stop this, cus one of these years a real inkie's going to sneak in.&quot; The children all giggled. &quot;But he's from Qeynos, so what does he know!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, how silly,&quot; Tysh said, grinning evilly.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Tyshalae returned home several hours later, face and hands covered with sugary goo, her tummy rumbling from too much candy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mouse?&quot;<br>
<br>
She jumped and turned, saw her Daddy grinning at her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where were you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Gettin' candy in Freeport,&quot; she mumbled, not able to think of a good lie.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahhhh, the annual sugar rush.... Me and Mourn went to that a few times,&quot; he said, remembering one of the few happy events from his rather painful childhood. &quot;What'd ya get?&quot;<br>
<br>
Tysh giggles and peered into her sack. &quot;Lotsa candy, a few stinky old apples , a nice bracelet and some rings.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Jewellery? You know the stuff they give out is fake, right Mouse?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ummmm, they didn't give Daddy, I took.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dantrazz ruffled her hair. &quot;That's my girl.&quot; He peered into the bag and pulled out some toffee and a ring. &quot;My bribe for not telling your mom... she'd kill us if she knew you were in Freeport at your age.... Now off to bed with you.&quot; The warrior picked up his wiggling daughter and popped the toffee in his mouth, smiling.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Over the next several weeks there was a spree of robberies throughout Freeport. The thief was good, leaving no clues save the occasional sticky mark where a priceless object d'art or jewel case once rested. No one realized that only the houses that gave good sweets at the mid-Autumn children's festival were targets.<br>
<br>
In Neriak a small, giddy thief inspected her hoard and grinned, hoping the next year would pass quickly. She had run out of candy and there was room in her closet and under her bed for more stuff.... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/utyshalae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tyshalae</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_purplespot.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10> at: 11/1/00 2:41:06 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/utyshalae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tyshalae</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_purplespot.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Mouse</span><br>  Posts: 70<br> <font color=#939393>(11/15/00 8:42:27 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/sbugelli/tyshface.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Trollies in the Attic</span><hr size=1> &quot;Weeeee!&quot; Tyshalae slid down the bannister screaming with glee. She had all of House W'Rath to herself for the afternoon. Momma and Daddy were out doing some sort of grown up thingie, Papa Sol was in Koonark and the servants had the day off. Only Cayla was around to watch over Tysh and she hadn't noticed the sleepy powder that had somehow fallen into her tea... so if was her own fault for taking an afternoon nap.<br>
<br>
&quot;I's hungry!&quot; Tysh declared to Quashie, her trollie rag-doll, when they reached the bottom of the stairs. Child and rag-doll went to the kitchen and started making lunch. She grabbed a large mixing bowl and started dumping things in; frosting, cookies, chocolate syrup, ice cream from the magic ice box.... The child then grabbed a large spoon and started to eat.<br>
<br>
When Tysh was almost finished her meal she heard a knock at the door. She ran to the giant carved wooden door and stared at it. She was not supposed to open the door, but there was no one else to do it. <br>
<br>
&quot;I dunno Quashie... What if its Auntie Ari or cousin Josh... they'd be mad if I didn't let ‘em in.&quot; She readied a dagger and opened the door... and found a rather confused looking troll.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello dere little inkie gurl! Dis be House W'Rath?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe.... Who the Hell are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I's Roku Elfbonker, trollie shammy!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Riiiight.... Do I know you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I dunno... I don't t'ink so....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmmmm....&quot; Tysh shoved her sundae covered rag-doll in the troll's face. &quot;Does Quashie know you?&quot;<br>
<br>
The troll grinned. &quot;Yub yub...Quashie know dis trollie!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, okies.... Come in, have some ice cream. I'm Tysh W'Rath.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ohhh, ohhh, okies.&quot; They went to the kitchen and made an even bigger mess.<br>
<br>
&quot;So,&quot; Tysh asked around mouthfuls of sweets, &quot;what the Hell do ya want?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ohhhh... Dis trollie needs somewhere to live. I don't wanna adventure so much and I don't wanna go back to Trollie Town.&quot; His voice dropped to a whisper. &quot;I's afraid of trollie gurls!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Smart!&quot; Tysh interjected.<br>
<br>
&quot;I's been going to everybuddy I know, but they's not home. Can dis troll live here?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I dunno.&quot; Tysh stared at the troll and thought hard. Her parents had always taught her to be kind to trollies and Tysh had never met one she did not like, including this silly one. &quot;We don't got any spare rooms in the main part of the house... but there's nothin' in the attic ‘cept junk. No one ever goes there ‘cept me. You can't come out during the day though, cus Cayla's kinda scared of trollies.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ohhhh, okies. I can make myself inbibible so I don't scare nobuddy if anybuddy comes up. Thank yous little Tysh. Will you come and play colouring books with Roku?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course ya big lug! Now lets get ya moved in,&quot; Tysh grinned at the trollie.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
&quot;Wooooo.&quot;<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Huge new messes started appearing in House W'Rath. When questioned Tysh would shrug and say the trollie did it. When it was pointed out that little Quashie could not possibly make such a big mess she informed them that the trollie in the attic did it. When the confused grown up wandered away, mumbling about how nothing so huge could possibly effectively hide in the chaotic mess that Tysh reigned over, the child simply grinned... and then went to play with her inbibible trollie. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/utyshalae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tyshalae</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_purplespot.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Mouse</span><br>  Posts: 97<br> <font color=#939393>(1/24/01 11:22:30 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/sbugelli/tyshface.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Tysh and the Queen of Night</span><hr size=1> &quot;Night Papa Sol!&quot; Tyshalae mumbled sleepily, cuddling her trollie rag-doll in her sleeping bag.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rest well little Mouse,&quot; the old Necromancer whispered from his own bedroll.<br>
<br>
They were camping in an abandoned stone building in the Ferrott Jungle, not far from the temple of Cazic Thule. Tysh had attained enough experience in the ways of the rogue to hunt the lizardmen that infested the area. She fell asleep listening to the sound of the hoots, trills and clicks of the jungle creatures, her tummy full of roast lizard and roots.<br>
<br>
Tysh often dreamed in her sleep, silly happy visions of running amuck through Norrath. Quashie was always by her side, though not as a rag-doll. He was a living breathing trollie, though a small one, no bigger than a halfling, the perfect sized playmate for the little dark elf.<br>
<br>
She was dreaming now, but this was different. Tysh was in a very dark forest, her treasured Bloodclaw in one hand, Quashie the rag-doll in the other. She could hear soft singing from deep within the woods and could make out a soft glow emanating from the same area.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well Quashie, where ever we are we should check dat out... might be something important!&quot; The well loved rag-doll responded in a deep rumble voice that only the child could hear as he always did.<br>
<br>
They wandered through the forest meeting no opponents or monsters until they reached a small clearing. A very tall dark elf lady was sitting on a rock, brushing out her long silver hair. She wore black armour like Tysh's Ravenscale, but different. The glow was coming from the sword that laid beside her.<br>
<br>
She looked at Tyshalae and smiled. &quot;Hello little Mouse.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tysh jumped at the sound of her name and eyed the woman warily. &quot;Who the Hell are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A friend of the family I suppose.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I never met ya before!&quot; Tysh waved her dagger at her.<br>
<br>
&quot;No need to be scared little one. I will not hurt you... I only wish to talk to you.&quot; Her voice was soft and soothing. Tysh shrugged and sheathed her blade, and sat in the soft grass by the lady's rock.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do ya wanna talk about?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you follow a god Tyshalae?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No... godses are silly! I believe in the power of my family, my blades, my guild...and Quashie of course,&quot; she grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;All very powerful I'm sure,&quot; the lady said with a smile. &quot;But what of the god of your people?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Inny? He's smelly! I don't need no god to teach me ‘bout hate either. I know lotsa ‘bout it cus I's one of the most hated people in Neriak. Even Auntie Yathy leaves me alone ‘bout Inny.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes... your aunt is his cleric it seems.&quot; The lady frowned for a moment. &quot;What of the prince of thieves then?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bristlebane, god of toeses? Is silly to worship food ya know.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I suppose.... Some worship the mother of dragons.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tysh giggled. &quot;Dey's food too lady.&quot;<br>
<br>
She laughed with the child for a moment. &quot;What do you know of the other gods?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Lots! Papa Sol taught me good! Dere's Tuna-air, goddess of pinkie elfses and the rainy guy and Cazic Tool, god of da feers! Lots of ‘em. Dey's all food or poopy heads. I's not gonna follow either of dose.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A very wise choice I suppose.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I's a smart little inkie!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, you are. You have been taught very well.&quot; The lady smiled again, her teeth very white between her dark violet lips. &quot;There are even more godses though.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No! Papa Sol tells me everythin' he knows!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes he does child.... But there are things that even he does not know, very secret things.&quot;<br>
<br>
The child stared at the lady, confused. &quot;Den who knows ‘bout ‘em?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;People here and there... people who would surprise you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I dunno... sounds kinda weirdly to me. What's yous name anyway?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am Night child.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ummmm...okies.&quot; Tysh smiled at the pretty lady, feeling comforted by her smooth voice.<br>
<br>
Night looked at the sky and frowned. &quot;Dawn is coming child. Time for you to go home.&quot; The lady gathered up her things and smiled at the child. Then she disappeared into the shadows.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bye bye.&quot; Tysh waved and felt sleepy. She curled up on the soft grass, hugging Quashie tight, and closed her bright green eyes....<br>
<br>
&quot;Child? Wake up Mouse.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tyshalae opened her eyes to a bright jungle morning, full of sweetly scented air and birdsong. Sol was slicing fruit for breakfast and she could see his skelly pet approaching with a pot of water for porridge.<br>
<br>
&quot;Did you sleep well my little Mouse?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Uhuh! Real good. I even had nifty dreamses.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That is good. Would you like to go hunting later?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah yeah! Lizzard lizzard!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well,&quot; he smiled. &quot;Gather some honey for breakfast and we will go later.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yay!&quot; Tysh ran out into the jungle, still in her nightie, laughing. She set her contemplations of her odd dream aside for later, and ended up forgetting about it in just a few moments. The forest was so alive and full of colour, there was no time to waste on things like that, which weren't even real.<br>
<br>
&quot;Children,&quot; Sol mumbled with a smile, as he watched her chase after a butterfly, totally unaware of the forces that had just touched his beloved little Mouse.... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/utyshalae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tyshalae</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_purplespot.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10> at: 1/24/01 11:28:03 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/utyshalae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tyshalae</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_purplespot.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Mouse</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#939393>(3/14/01 6:09:11 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/sbugelli/tyshface.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Mourning</span><hr size=1> Tyshalae laid in bed, not quite asleep, Quashie cuddled against her chest. She could hear her daddy snoring softly from the big comfy chair by her bed....<br>
<br>
After the funeral they had returned to the large and empty feeling house. Daddy had come to say good night after Tysh got into bed. As he hugged her, Tysh started to sob, and he silently added his tears to hers. He decided to sit up with her until she fell asleep, but instead fell asleep first, from exhaustion and sorrow.<br>
<br>
Tysh started to dream, though she was sure she was still really awake.... This was not like her usual dreams, but like the one with pretty dark elf lady named Night. Tysh found herself walking through the same dark forest, towards the same glow.<br>
<br>
Tyshalae reached the clearing and peered through the shrubs. Night was there, in her fine black armour. Another woman sat with her, in black chain mail with red plate mail gauntlets.<br>
<br>
&quot;Momma!&quot; Tysh shrieked, running into the clearing. She hugged the slim woman tightly and felt her hug back, running her hands over Tysh's tangled silver hair.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tyshalae, look at me little Mouse.&quot; Tysh raised her head and stared at her mother's face through her tears. She was smiling slightly and her eyes glowed like the last embers in a fire place. &quot;Don't cry Tysh, Momma needs you to be strong for her.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tyshalae sniffled and nodded. &quot;I's tryin Momma,&quot; she whispered.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know baby.&quot; The Redhand removed her gloves and wiped at Tysh's tears with gentle fingers. &quot;You have to take care of your Daddy and Papa Sol for me Tysh.... Make sure your Daddy doesn't fade away like my father did when my mother was gone.... You have to be stronger than your sorrow for me little one, and take care of them.&quot;<br>
<br>
The child nodded. &quot;I know Momma. I's tryin real hard, but I's just a little mousie.&quot;<br>
<br>
She tickled the child's nose and nodded, the same wistful smile on her beautiful face. &quot;You have to promise me one more thing my baby....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What Momma?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That you'll never grow up all the way, that even when you're a momma you'll still be my little Mouse, just a little bit. Can you do that Tysh?&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled just slightly, for the first time in many days. &quot;I can do that Momma.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good,&quot; she said, hugging her daughter tight. &quot;I love you Tyshalae.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I love you too Momma and I miss you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know,&quot; she whispered.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Dawn is coming Morrigu... we must go,&quot; Night said, gazing sadly at the two of them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fare well Tysh,&quot; Morrigu whispered, embracing the child tightly one last time. She then stood and grasped Night's hand in her own. As they faded away in the morning light, she spoke once more. &quot;Remember my little Mouse, remember....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I will Momma,&quot; Tyshalae said to the empty forest....<br>
<br>
Tysh woke, her eyes moist with tears. Daddy was still asleep in the chair, his face looked scared and sad. She grabbed Quashie and her blanket and climbed on to his lap, her small face pressed into his soft shirt. He wrapped his arms around her and mumbled in his sleep.<br>
<br>
&quot; I love you too Daddy,&quot; Tysh whispered. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/utyshalae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tyshalae</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_purplespot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Mouse</span><br>  Posts: 143<br> <font color=#939393>(7/11/01 6:12:46 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/sbugelli/tyshface.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Whispers on the Wind</span><hr size=1> The child climbed to the highest peak she knew of, bearing her burden silently in the dark. She was short for her age, and thin. Her green eyes were wild, staring at the eastern horizon, which was brightenig with the coming sunrise. Her hair was silver, but had tangled itself into ropey cords that writhed around her face like shinney snakes. Her momma could no longer brush out the tangles and snarls, and it hurt when her daddy or papa tried. <br>
<br>
She stopped when she reached the top, staring at the reddish-rold edge of the sun as it rose. A smile spread over her face even as tears started to flow from her green eyes. <br>
<br>
She tossed her burden, a huge bunch of multi-colored flowers, into the wind and the sunlight, watching as the lighter ones took flight and the heavier ones settled on the snow like jewels. <br>

&quot;Happy birthday,&quot; she whispered to the wind, knowing her wishes would reach the one she wanted it to, who she missed so much. <br>
<br>
Tyshalae wiped at her tears with slim red-gloved fingers. She pulled a well loved troll rag-doll from a bag at her belt and hugged it tight. <br>
<br>
&quot;C'mon Quashie... let's go see what's goin on down dere.&quot; The trollie agreed that was a good idea, as always, and they ran down the mountian, laughing. <br>
<br>
The wind carried the faint sound of another's laughter, not heard on Norrath for too long, and then was only wind again.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/utyshalae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tyshalae</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_purplespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Mouse</span><br>  Posts: 209<br> <font color=#939393>(11/20/01 9:25:25 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/sbugelli/tyshface.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Perfect Gift</span><hr size=1> Tyshalae stared at Quashie, deep in thought, tugging on one of her long silver dread-locks, an unconscious sign of frustration. The little trollie had tried to help as best he could, but his experience in some things was rather limited. She looked at the rag-doll for a moment, a gleam in her slightly mad green eyes and grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course Quashie! Roku would know!&quot; She hugged her giant lazy kitty, then picked her trollie up, jumped off her bed and ran down the hall.<br>
<br>
Tysh raced up the old stairs to the attic, Quashie tucked into his roomy pouch on her belt. She pushed the door open and smiled. The mess was cozy and the air held a subtle scent of troll.<br>
<br>
&quot;Roku? You out in da forest or you inbibible?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey dere little Tyshie!&quot; The troll slowly appeared on the old mattress that sat on the dusty floor. &quot;Der de der! Me just be trimmin me nailses.... Woo lookit my new colourin bookses!&quot; He pointed to a stack of thin books, the top one open to a partially coloured drawing on a froglok. Roku then preceded to chew off another pesky bit of overgrown toenail.<br>
<br>
Tysh picked up a different book and found a picture of a dragon, which she started colouring to resemble the nice silvery one in Koonark that had not tried to eat her. She looked up suddenly, feeling an intense trollie gaze on her.<br>
<br>
&quot;What be wrong little gurl? Yous makin weirdly feelings at Roku.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tysh sighed and tugged on a dread-lock. &quot;Ummmm, kinda Roku.... What do trollies do when dey like another trollie?&quot;&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
&quot;Wooooo!&quot; Roku clapped, his toes forgotten. &quot;Tyshie like a boy!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ewwwwww! Noooooo!. Boys are gross Roku! I mean not you an all, but ewwww!&quot; Tysh spit on the floor. &quot;Besides, I's only eight an three quarters, an he's like a hundred or something. An Daddy said I's not allowed to date till I's four hundred an twelve. An I gots lotsa ‘sponsibilities now that I's a whosit ya know!&quot; Tyshie grinned for a second. &quot;An besides when I grow up I's gonna marry a trollie!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ummmm... okies Tyhsie... Den what be dis one?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, he be an inkie.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well den, da way to let an inkie know ya likes im is with a present!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wooo... inkies do like presentses,&quot; Tysh said, speaking from experience. &quot;But what do boyses like Roku?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Froggies,&quot; the troll grinned, also speaking form experience. &quot;Boys like froggies. An I can take ya to da world's bestest froggies if ya like Tyshie.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yay!&quot; Tyshalae pounced on her friend in a whirlwind of sticky fingers and flying dreads, giving him a great big hug.<br>
<br>
**********<br>
<br>
&quot;What is going on here?&quot; Saerin asked his Erudite servant, staring at the mess inside House N'Vere, the only Teir'dal noble house in the dark city of Paineel. He had been away from home for many weeks, hunting throughout the lands with his adopted sister Cybele and his guild mates. When he returned home he found not tranquillity, but chaos.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well sir....&quot; The old man shuddered slightly. &quot;The sticky fingerprints has been washed off all the surfaces, though I'm afraid the damask sofa was damaged beyond repair and is being re-covered in a pattern I felt you would approve of. Several pieces of jewellery and a small statue have been stolen. We have no suspects, though the inquisitors are assisting us in the search. As for the... ummmm.&quot; The servant brushed a frog off the shadowknight's shoulder.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes! Do tell me about the frogs!&quot; Saerin regarded one that hopped onto his gauntlet. It was about an inch long, brilliantly coloured, with bright yellow eyes. It would be a rather attractive little creature, if his home were not crawling the hundreds of its cousins.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have gotten them out of all the living quarters, though they wont stay out of the baths or the ornamental ponds.&quot; He brushed on off his own robe. &quot;Ummm... in fact they seem to be breeding in the ponds sir. Shall I have them filled in?&quot; The man then pulled something for his pocket. &quot;I almost forgot sir. We found this as well. Does it mean anything to you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Saerin fingered the rope of matted silver hair and almost grinned. &quot;Leave the frogs be for now I suppose, and for Thule's sake do not fill in the ponds. Cybele would be furious I think.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well sir,&quot; the old butler answered, turning away carefully to not crush any of the tiny creatures. <br>
<br>
&quot;Mouse...&quot; the shadowknight mumbled under his breath, watching as several little frogs jumped onto the shinny lock of matted hair, crawling about on it and chirping merrily. He stuffed it into his pocket, frogs and all and left for a meeting with his Heretic teachers.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#939393>- </font><a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bshadowsoftheblade>House W'Rath</a><font color=#939393> - </font><a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fshadowsofthebladecharacterstoriesbackgroundsandsuch>Character Stories (Backgrounds and Such)</a> <font color=#939393> - </font><a href="http://members.home.net/sbugelli">House W'Rath Common Hall</a><font color=#939393> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
