The run from the nearest tie-able portal was scary enough for me, but once inside this hole, I knew that we were in for a whopper of a night in Dereth.<br>
<br>
The atmosphere is one of near darkness with acid vaper in the air at all times, and of course, acid pits scattered about for good measure. The residents are lvl 65 Olthoi Soldiers, and all their cousins, and their cousins, cousins (ad infinitum). Finding a safe spot to rebuff is inconceivable and the floor ... well I think there is a floor ... we spent the whole evening walking through loot that was knee-deep and scattered everywhere.<br>
<br>
<br>
There are bodies at every turn, both olthoi and players. The spawn rate is so high that as soon as the last soldier hits the floor, the next round is spawning on top of the corpses. Ghar and I were in a position more than once of simply trying to block the incoming swarm and letting Crow and Dia put them down as fast as possible. Healing, not fighting, for 3-5 minutes at a pop. Without Dia and Crow, we would have died like rats.<br>
<br>
At the point where I died, we had been fighting non-stop for a good 15 minutes without making any forward progress, my buffs were long gone, and I was trapped by no less than 15 soldiers. They had me physically surrounded and I was unable to move. I was popping Dia's healing soup and healing elixers one after another, and it wasn't enough to keep up with all the damage.<br>
<br>
Upon regrouping, we had a better idea of what we needed to do, and we made smoother progress ... that is until Dia lagged out of the game at the entrance to one of the heavy spawn rooms! Ghar, Crow and I surrounded her body as it spun helplessly in place and kept her alive until her account closed and she finally poofed out. Once she was able to log back in, we carried on and made it to the end of the dungeon without mishap.<br>
<br>
Once we had reached our objective, we decided to stay for a bit and take out some soldiers in retribution. This was by far the most intense, nonstop fighting I have ever seen in AC. The spawn rate is so high in the last room and hallway area, that everyone's frame rates were slowed. We stood there for 20-30 minutes and when one needed to buff, the other three would form a rough block across the hall and the fourth would drop back to the relative (snicker here) safety of the rear of the hall and rebuff. I don't think that there was a time longer than 20 seconds when a soldier wasn't advancing on our position, and most of the time it was three or four at a time. <br>
<br>
After this went on for a while, I think that we actually all tired of fighting, haha! We decided to recall, which took another 5 minutes with no breaks in the spawn, but eventually, we all made it out, everyone with their major acid stone in-hand.<br>
<br>
In the end, we all fought with grace and flair and made great exp in this crazy place. At a weak and puny 12-percent of the experience take, Frodrick made almost 200,000 experience, wow!</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#6B8E23><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Crow</FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Unregistered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>3/26/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>7:46:24 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=540.topic&index=1><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Reply</FONT></A></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">What a night!</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">How can I match Roy's words! I can't, but it was one heck of a night! We actually had to make 2 trips to complete this quest do to deaths in the family, Roy and Crow, but the reason was totally understandable. We didn't know it at the time, but we were only a few steps away from safety and the acid stone. We were being crushed by wave after wave after wave of bugs! Unfortunately, we were trying to defend a T shaped hallway and were being swarmed from all sides. If the bug corpses didn't dissolve or the game would allow them to stack, we would have had dead bugs frm floor to ceiling! They were so thick we couldn't see each other! All we could hear was the slap of bow strings and the swish of Ghar's hammer and Frodrick's cestus. I'll tell you what..that was THE most excitement I've had in-game to date! I thought we were dead at least 100 times but we always managed to pull through. The 4 of us were even holding one of the highest spawn rate areas of the game and could have continued except for running out of arrows and the low frame rate as we bogged down the server with 100's of corpses and piles of loot! It was a great night made even more fun by acting as a team and winning through to the acid stone! Thanks all!! My armor is now an ugly green color with the stone installed in it, but it sure is nice against acid breath!</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#2f2f4f><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Wamba</FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Unregistered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>3/27/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>8:22:27 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=540.topic&index=2><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Reply</FONT></A></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">sigh</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">All I did for excitement was replumb an old stool.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#6B8E23><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bforgottentruthforeignlegion.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dia>Dia</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>3/27/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>9:49:28 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=540.topic&index=3><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Reply</FONT></A></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: What a night!</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">When I'll grow old, I will take my grand children on my knees and will proudly say: &quot;I was part of it that night! Let me tell you how it went&quot;<br>
<br>
Thanks for saving me when I lagged out! I didn't know what had happen then, but I was happy to reappear in the dungeon and not at the lifestone!<br>
<br>
I've learned things reding your story. I had no idea that Crow died at the T intersection. Like it was said, there was so many bugs there that we couln't see each other. I went out of arrows and was running through my packs to find my UA gloves, UA weapon, shield, coord 4, strengh 4 and healing like crazy in the process. When this was done I started to defend myself against all the bugs hitting me and I shortly saw a message telling me to get out of there! There were so many dots on the radar that I couldn't see if any of you were around me and I assumed that you had all ran foward while I was changing my gears. So I just ramed into the room and got to the next hallway thinking I would catch up on you. I ended up in a dead end, turned aroud and fought the olthois that had followed me. Then surprize! The green stone was at my feet! I sent the message that I was at the stone, but I think that you all understood that I was at the lifestone. I admit that my message wasn't very clear. I dont know if at that moment you were in or out of the dungeon or even dead. <br>
<br>
I really like those mission with an objective to pursue. I like those big rooms to clear. I don't like fast spawns, endless fighting making it impossible to loot our kills. But still, this was a great evening and a great accomplishment!<br>

<br>
That was just amazing, I have never seen anything like it. It was literally a never-ending swarm of olthoi; we just couldn't kill them as fast as they were respawning. I can't believe we held them off as long as we did. I think there were 20-30 olthoi spawning in that last room, and we basically fought them to a standstill. But it was soon obvious that we couldn't hold them forever, and eventually we started to lose ground. Then Dia ran out of arrows and Crow went down, and it was all over at that point. Between the lag and sheer number of bugs, it was impossible to keep track of where everyone was. Frod and I ended up backed against the wall near the exit portal, completely surrounded. Then Frod went down just outside the portal, and I started really getting hammered. At that point I forgot about fighting and started trying to figure out how to get out in one piece. Dropping my shield to use my wand to recall was out of the question, so I just started backing towards the portal and healing like mad, while hoping nothing nasty was sneaking up behind me. I finally got out with about 40 health left, and of course there was all kinds of orange dots showing up on the radar once I was outside, so I just ran around blindly until I could equip my wand and recall.<br>
<br>
Once we regrouped, the second attempt went beautifully. Well, except for Dia lagging out, that was a bit scary! But thanks to Dia having found the stone, we knew just where to go this time. And once we got accross the Room-O-Death, we were in the long narrow dead-end corridor where the stone spawned. We held the corridor for a long time, really racking up the kills, until finally everyone was just exhausted from the endless fighting!<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone for an evening of fun, thrills, and my shiny new Stinging Stone! That's a night I'll remember for a long, long time!</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=95%><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT></TD><TD ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showMessage?topicID=543.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1><< Prev Topic</FONT></A> &nbsp;<A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showMessage?topicID=538.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Next Topic >></FONT></A> </TD></TR></TABLE><BR><TABLE WIDTH=95% BORDER=0><TR><TD><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=540.topic&index=4><IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/addReply1.gif border=0></A></TD><TD><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=540.topic><IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/images/email.gif BORDER=0 ALT="Email This To a Friend"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Email This To a Friend</FONT><BR><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.threadControl?topicID=540.topic><IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/deleteThreadFire.gif BORDER=0 ALT="Topic Control Image"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Topic Commands (Moderator only)</FONT><BR><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=540.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Subscribe</FONT></A>  <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Click to receive email notification of replies</FONT><BR><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=540.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Unsubscribe</FONT></A>  <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</FONT><BR></TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3 ALIGN=CENTER><BR><FORM ACTION=http://pub10.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum METHOD=POST><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Jump to: </FONT><SELECT NAME=forumName><OPTION VALUE=forgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral>General<OPTION VALUE=forgottentruthforeignlegionlinks>Links<OPTION VALUE=forgottentruthforeignlegionmembers>Members<OPTION VALUE=forgottentruthforeignlegionquotes>Quotes<OPTION VALUE=forgottentruthforeignlegionfrm4>Uber Loot</SELECT><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE=Go></FORM></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><CENTER><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>- </FONT><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bforgottentruthforeignlegion><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Forgotten Truth Foreign Legion</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0> - </FONT><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>General</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0> - </FONT><A HREF=http://ftfl.iwarp.com/index.html><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Home</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0> - </FONT></B></CENTER><P><BR><CENTER><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.free-irewards.com/cgi-bin/ezboard/games.html?id=ouuIcESe" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/banners/iRewards120x30-08.gif"></a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><IMG SRC="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/serve?bfmid=7279965&siteid=33932331&bfpage=expertc_tax" BORDER="0" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" NOSAVE >
