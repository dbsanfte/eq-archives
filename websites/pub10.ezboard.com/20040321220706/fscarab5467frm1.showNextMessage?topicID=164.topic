<br>
By Sivanar of the Jesters in Norrath ! (www.jestersinnorrath.co.uk)<br>
<br>
<br>
Hi all. It has come to my mind, as I finally had my Singing Short Sword in hand last night, that I should write a small post destined to all the bards in Norrath who are striving, in guilds big or especially small, desperately to get this epic. <br>
<br>
A sure way to recognise a bard striving to get his / her epic is the paleness around the eyes, notes and songs going astray, a penchant for alcohol and various dangerous substances, a reclining away from the world, a higher train pulling ratio and general suicidal tendencies. You see their look of hate, envy and disgust when they glance at those with the prized notes emitting weapon.<br>
<br>
But fellow bards, hear my tale, and you will realise you can make it. Here is how to do it….<br>
<br>
On a bright day, the sun rises and you realise you have heard the bells announcing your level 50. You have heard all the talk about epics and decide you could really do with one, since you would be kind of an achiever at a game where, in the past, your most noticeable abilities have been dying in unprecedented places and ways, training and killing your guild in countless raids (from Unrest to Paw to Mistmoore to Seb and so on and so forth) and having half the mobs in Norrath chasing you for your mismatched tunes and not understanding any damn thing about the advances your music does. (Only the Coldain dwarves like my music, but then they have had their ears cut from frostbite or are wearing those sound protection helmets).<br>
<br>
You then go to the websites to check what you have to do for the epic. Read everywhere “A bard with a white Dragon Scale is a bard with epic). <br>
<br>
Decide to focus on killing Vox and Nagafen for your scales, before you hit level 52, so that you have your epic in your pocket.<br>
<br>
-&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Go to three Vox raids. Lose all the rolls.<br>
-&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Decide to organise and lead a Vox raid and reserve the loot. Have your raid highjacked by a stupid person, fight over raid leadership, finally win it back (after threats and GMs). Kill Vox, repent over reserving the loot (after all these other bards did play a role). Open up the roll. Lose the roll.<br>
-&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Go to three more Vox raids (organised by Azzitay, Tunare save his soul). On each raid, watch as a level 47 bard who is on his first Vox raid comes in and wins the roll. And says “WOOT it is amazing first time I come to a Vox raid and I win”<br>
-&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Go to Vox raid number 8 : THREE White Dragon Scales Drop, there are four bards… Amazingly you win on the third dragon scale…<br>
<br>
-&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At this stage, think “YESS I have the epic”<br>
<br>
-&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Go to a Nagafen raid. See Naggy drop Red Scale AND Cloak of Flames. See all the warriors and bard rolling for Cloak and not Scale. Win your Red Dragon Scale.<br>
<br>
At this stage you have the two scales and you think you now have your epic, it is only a matter of weeks…<br>
<br>
In your enthousiasm do the running hand ins, botch the Maligar fight once (remember to charm him folks), redo the running hand ins and kill maligar for good.<br>
<br>
The next bit involves getting guts after opening the bellies of various dragons. Find Nekezekena in Burning Woods. Get Ice Cometted to death a couple of times, but get your drop while disgusted magicians watch after several days of camping the same mob for their ember stuff (at least they have their pets to talk to). Kill Blackwing in Rathe Mountains (Solo !! on the first go).<br>
<br>
Proceed to Skyfire to find Eldrig the Old. Hunt him for over two weeks on your own. Fail miserably to locate him, track him, get killed a few times in the process. In the end, in desperation, go to the Bazaar and find a MQ of his guts. <br>
<br>
Now comes the fun part, the mystical lute.<br>
<br>
Hang in Karnor Castle just for fun until someone shouts “Warlord Head for free”. Run there and get it ; easy teasy.<br>
<br>
Head to Plane of Fear. You are by then regularly raiding with Scarab (the good Brell bless them). On your first Plane of Fear raid, get wiped five times at zone in. On your second Plane of Fear raid, advance quite far after killing golems, get to the fire wall. At this stage, the raid leader asks you to locate corpses of fallen heroes and drag them. Get surprised by a few nasties, die. As you wait somewhere naked, hear the raid say “Amygdalan Tendril drop : it is for you Sivanar we rez you”. Crash to desktop upon rezzing. By the time you are back, the drop has rotted. Go to two more POF raids that stop just short of castle. Finally on the fifth POF raid, go with your lovely guild and organise the raid, and get the drop.<br>
<br>
Proceed to kill Phinagel Autropos in Kedge Keep 14 times. Not one, not ten but FOURTEEN times. As you have 1) a real life 2) children 3) a work, watch in desperation as every night for several months you go down there and track and find Phinagel not up , add also the times Phinagel is up but some group gets ahead of you to kill it, or the times you find a lvl 65 mage soloing him. In the end wake up VERY early one Sunday morning, find two very powerful necroes in your guild (Edel and Deathangel), have them come and help kill Phinagel (and rez you after you have botched pulling) and get your Kedge Backbone !!! (By this time you start having a creepy feeling every time you load onto the game and hear the damm music ; it is advised to switch the sound off entirely). <br>
<br>
You are now in sole possession of all the items you need. At this stage, you have been organising epic raids for your guild for a while and a lot of your long time friends have their epic : it is wonderful.<br>
<br>
Proceed to Sebilis for the final Trakanon fight. Organise a raid to get a COTH bridge in place at the cave. Find Undead Bard up. Organise a second raid. Since one of your guildies is at the same stage as you, do a random roll to see who wins. Lose the roll. <br>
<br>
Organise another raid after your guild has for one week been camping all members of a COTH bridge to check for the mob. Find him up ; summon friends from allied guilds, ex members of your guild (which is simply the bestJ), everybody who wants. Get the force to do it.<br>
Forget to have everyone buffed at once… Speak with undead bard. See Trakanon spawn. At 70 % shout NUKE. See as the wizard in your group makes a mistake in his hotkeys and instead of pressing his Ice Comet Cast, does a Teleport to Emerald Jungle. Find yourself with Trak’s poison DOT on you (eating 10% of your HP per tick), in the middle of nowhere, with no healer near you. Hear all the folks in the raid Wooting for the dead Trak. Run to Trak teeth. Get COTH and given a poison potion which prevents you from dying (you are at 5% life). Zone in Seb, get another COTH and loot the dragon guts !!!<br>
<br>
After all this, you have your epic !!!<br>
<br>
See is that not simple ?<br>
<br>
Big thanks must go to countless people who helped during all this : all the Jesters in Norrath Guild (we are wonderful happy people) (Canelin, Tarkan, Viglaine, Kollip, Chortie, Iwishi, What, Edel, Chees, Dethangel, Jiggla, Auun, Fizzlebin, Nanya, Lupes, Myxalidia, Ameena, Kerenx, Tikketyboo, Moany, Garoid, Tunor, Ithilgalad, Gitrah etc.. etc…), Vivir and his friends from Wyrd Angles (Ironlung, Pele, Badkat etc..), Aammer, Jitatha and their friends from Divine Presence, Hazoun from X’Agon and Pioupiou from UK, Daslayed and his resourceful friends (Nexus of Dreams and Warbirds), Snana and Timoune and folks from Flamme Eternelle, the friends from Unity Combine (Tangrim), Scarab members (Zentaran, Runemoon, Goldark, sild, Karolus, Azzitay and all the friends from Botschaft der Shickals), Peterous, Jdemo and Nekcros, Appoccolipstick, Jonh . <br>
<br>
I organise quite a lot of open raids and it is really nice to see how many folks always come to them and to share our fun ; deep gratitude goes to them and, while we see a few complaining posts here, I think we also have a nice server with a lot of folks coming to help out. <br>
<br>
So if you are despairing, spending too much time in underwater dungeons, wondering how in hell you are going to get there, send me a tell , I will have a few nice words to cheer you up !! <br>
<br>
All it takes is one year of time, 8 vox raids, 5 Plane of fear raids, 1 Naggy raid, 14 Phinagel kills and 3 Trakanon raids J.<br>
