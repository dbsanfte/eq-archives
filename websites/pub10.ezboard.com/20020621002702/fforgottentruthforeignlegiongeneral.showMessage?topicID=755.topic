If we intend to branch our guild into other realms it ought to be servers we can RvR on and we ought to decide soon and with resolve.

That's a very good point about there not being much chance for RvR on test. If I had to vote, I'd say Guinevere just because I think a lot of us made low-level characters there when the game first came out, but I don't have any characters high enough to mind starting somewhere else if that's what everyone wants. One thing to keep in mind is Guinevere is a roleplaying server in case that bothers anyone. On the other hand, I think it's a bit less crowded than other servers.<br>
<br>
Whichever server we decide, that will probably end up being my main... I really like the race/class combos in Midgard compared to the other realms.<br>

I often lag so badly in Palomides on Friday and Saturday nights that the game is almost not playable, however, I could go to Test and do just fine.  Also, the dungeons are so crowded, that people become hostile, and the playing atmosphere is often of a lesser quality during peak times. <br>
<br>
The concerns regarding R vs R are very valid, and I agree that there are just not the numbers to do so on Test in any normal way.  However, we have yet to accomplish much in R vs R on Palomides, so I suppose I was not thinking we'd be ready for that on a 2nd server so soon.  I was picturing playing on Midgard as more recreational until we had matured into high-level characters on the first server.  I was envisioning a revolving process where we played one realm and accomplished great feats as a guild and as individuals, then moved on to the next realm until we had conquered all 3.  I am guilty of liking to play lowbies of new races in different terrain as much as the next person, but I have a fear of the guild becoming too split and seperated.  I had tried to make Friday night Test night, to give everyone an opportunity to still play together, but get variety, but that was met with lukewarm acceptance, only a handful of people joined me.<br>
<br>
My question to the guild is:  To what extent do we want to play on another server in another realm?  Do we just want a haven to play in when boredom strikes, or are we already moving on before we make our mark in our current world?  We have done GREAT as a guild, and I am so happy with how we play together, share, treat everyone with respect, and even though we have grown in numbers every week, I still feel a great sense of family among us, and that is exactly how I think it should be.  I would enjoy having a level 50 character in each realm eventually, and experience as much of each that there is to offer, but only if I have my guildmates with me to enjoy the experience.  I feel that we work well together, and that we could make great contributions to our land.  Our potential is great - perhaps much greater than alot of guilds that are built on recruiting #s instead of people...  I like to think of each of us as an individual, and I miss those of you that do not play often on Palomides, and always look forward to seeing each and every one of you any chance I get.  I think most of us feel this way! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
That being said, I DO think we should decide upon a server for each realm, and create a guild there as soon as possible too, for ease in finding our friends there.  Don't misunderstand.  I will probably spend time in each on occassion even now, but I would like to stick to one main, so that we might remain together and experience the new things together as a family - as our guild.  <br>
<br>
My vote will be to stick with the guild's original decision to play on Guinevere for Midgard. <p>Krystl</i>, Albion Cleric of Palomides<br>

<br>
Albion Server: Palomides<br>
Hibernia Server: Bedevere<br>
Midgard Server: Guinivere<br>
<br>
I have no real investment in the Mid or Hib servers, so I don't mind where we go, but I also think that we should remain true to our original decision to support those folks who went to those servers expecting to have a guild some day.<br>
<br>
Either way, I will go where the guild decides.<br>
<br>
I wonder if we should also add a topic or two to this discussion... Are we planning to move as a guild to a new server or is this an afirmation of our original decision?<br>
<br>
If we are thinking about doing a guild switch, are we going to make provisions for those folks who prefer Albion / Palomedes? How would we do this?<br>
<br>
I don't really care which realm we play, but I do hate to see all of the time invested in Tavik go away. I don't often have enough time to &quot;keep up&quot; with the majority of the guild and I know that a few others have similar problems.<br>
<br>
One way to sample all of the various flavors might be to set up a play calendar that let's us all play more or less together by moving from realm to realm on a set schedule. Maybe from week to week we could alternate Albion / Midguard? If we get interested in Hibernia later it would not be hard to add them too...<br>

This especially works well if you're a buffer, healer or minstrel as resists will not be an issue for you.<br>
<br>
I avoided this for a long time thinking I would be little help, but I think I did ok and gained levels at an astonishing rate.<br>
<br>
The bad thing about this is you miss a whole section of the game this way. Luckily for me, I skipped a section (7-14)that I had done over &amp; over &amp; over, so it didn't affect me too much.<br>
<br>
Also, if you try this out, please put some thought into how you will spend your points. The XP gravy train won't be forever, so plan accordingly. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I like variety and enjoy all three servers and each of the characters I have depending on my mood, the number of distractions I have going on, how close one or another is to some achievement, etc.  I don't usually have the same kind of uninterrupted game time as alot of people so I tend to hunt solo more and to level much slower than most.  <br>
<br>
What I enjoy most about a guild is being able to chat and  participate in conversations with a great group of people.  I can do that in Forgotten Truth and would like to be able to do that with whoever else is of like mind to play in a certain realm at a given time.  Perhaps special get-togethers and RvR parties could be announced here to get max guild involvement in a certain realm.  <br>
<br>
Given that, I would LOVE to see the guild formed on all three of the original servers.... I can contribute to the registration money, too, if that would help.<br>

We are not a 'role-playing' guild as a whole, and I can understand the concern that we might not fit in well with the &quot;tattle-tale&quot; policies of the RP servers.  Is anyone attached to this server in particular?  I want to make a decision on Midgard asap... I need feedback about the RP server.  I know it was our original pick, and I think we should stick to Bedevere for Hibernia, however, it might be worthwhile to think about whether or not we'd survive on an RP server.  I know names are a huge issue there (doubtful they'd pass names such as Lunasea, Beefheart, Krystl Klear....).

Overwhleming demand for another RP server turned Guinivere from a normal to an RP server.<br>
<br>
I have a level 1 unplayed Kobold on Guinivere as a nameholder for Creepy and that's about it. Any server except Merlin is fine with me, although I'd give a slight nod to the newer and therefore less crowded servers.<br>

But I would definitely recommend starting on a less crowded server.   <br>
<br>
I personally dont care much for the &quot;RP&quot; servers.  No one can come up with a definition of what RP should be, so like someone else posted you get a bunch of whiners who want to appeal everything from your name to the words you use.  I guess if you were really roleplaying a whiner it wouldnt be quite as bad <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
