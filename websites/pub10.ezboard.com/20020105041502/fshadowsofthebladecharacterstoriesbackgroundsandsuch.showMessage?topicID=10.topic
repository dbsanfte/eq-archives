The older woman had brought him food again, but he did not take any. It had been almost a week since he had last eaten, a week since it had happened. He was away campaigning in the South. He was slaughtering Gnolls in Infected Paw when he received the summons. The sudden impulses that assailed his mind brought him to his knees. The telepathic link that all the members of the Obsidian Blade shared was being torn asunder. He know the cause, in his mind he had seen such situations before, even been a part of them. His Guild was under attack. He could feel the rage and hatred burning across Norrath from his Brothers and Sisters. Through the “mind-sight” he caught glimpses of the enemy. They were not, as he expected, lightcrawler scum who had launched an ambush, but other members of the Respected Race. He could see momentary flashed of other House emblems worn by the soldiers and the tell-tale colors of various Caster’s robes which told which House they served. Running from Kanara, each moment of battle had been imprinted on his soul. As he headed North he realized, with detached analysis, the logic of the attack. The Blade had grown in recent months, grown too quickly, too large.<br>
<br>
The Obsidian Blade had always been a clandestine and secretive group of select individuals who traveled in silence. But, with their victories against the lightcrawlers and their increased power in all facets of Teir’dal society they had become noticed. For the Children of Neriak, to be noticed was to become a target. With the preparations for another war and his recent obsession with the artifact, the defenses of the Blade had been stretched too thin. As he reached the Ro desert, he felt the last of the Blade fall. The Blade had become powerful but not strong and now they paid the price of such folly. By the time he reached Neriak, there was nothing left of the Obsidian Blade’s keep but a smoldering ruin. He saw where the battle had been fought and felt some pride, there was much destruction. Many more of the attackers had died, and it looked as if the well organized attack had finally broken down into chaos. It was a victory for the other Houses, but an extremely costly one.  The victorious families had removed their dead, no evidence-no crime, and had returned to their respective estates. That was the brilliance of the plan, no fear of official retribution.<br>
<br>
Since the Blade was not a Noble House, indeed, not even an acknowledged family within Teir’dal society, there could be no Claim of Vengeance. There would be no official sanctions, not even an investigation. What lived in the shadows also had died there, and no one would admit to seeing a thing. Such was the way of the Respected Race, such was the path of the powerful. After seeing to the burial of his younger Brothers and Sisters, Zirrix had returned to T’Rhennic keep. If he had died in the battle, his body could have been disposed of and there would be no proof. But now, as he walked through the 3rd gate, no one dared strike against him. He was, after all, a member of a Noble House and any open attack against him personally would bring about an “official” retribution. So he had come home, those few days ago and had neither eaten nor slept since. He just paced the halls of his keep, like some tormented spector, and contemplated his position. Despite the extermination of the Blade, he was a pragmatist. He knew he was still powerful, feared and respected amongst his people. In fact, he had recently been receiving “tokens of admiration” from other guilds of Norrtah. In his study there were weapons, armor, jewels and magic items most valuable and rare. Even now, they sought his favor and wished to entice him to join their cause. He would have none of it. Better to be alone then settle for less then the Blade. The “tokens” would all be returned tomorrow. As he entered his private wing, he thought of the reports his informants had given him. <br>
<br>
Apparently he was not the only member of the Blade to survive. The Matron was missing and her body had not been found amongst the dead. Likewise her Sole-Consort, Dantrazz, had gone to seek refuge with some old allies in the traitors guild of Evoluxia. Zirrix did not begrudge him that, the dead cannot exact revenge so, best to go where it is safest. He had also heard that Quash, one of the First Blades to be forged, was even now attempting to rally an army in his home city of Grobb and come to Neriak for Vengeance. Zirrix had  heard the other reports as well, and in the darkness of his room, smiled. It seems that more then a few other House Matrons had been found in their beds with their throats slit and their eyes removed. Yes, Zirrix was not alone. For now though, he sat on his bed and wondered. He had felt much in his life, but for the first time he felt this new emotion, it was unpleasant but not crippling. In time the feeling would recede and he would continue on. He would return to the world of the Respected Race. In the end, he was Teir’dal, and this just despair…    <br>

Nearby, in a huge fireplace, several timbers burned softly in colors of red and molten blue. The firelight was absorbed by the dark, golden liquid in his glass and reflected back a sparkling, translucent amber hue. It was Ol’Tijmuns Ale and he had brewed it himself. He had crafted a rather large stock some time ago. He had been practicing to become a Master Brewer and had almost filled a store room with his successes. Along the way he had also perfected other recipes as well. He could make everything from Oggok swill to Gypsie wine. From Riverdale ale to Neriakian vodka. Many had come to him and asked for a cask or a few bottles whenever a holiday was on the calendar. The only difficulty was the ingredients. Obtaining things such as vegetable, not the common kind sold by merchants, but special brewers yield was no small task. Most of those who knew were to find and could harvest such crops were of the lightcrawler races. He had much experience slaughtering or enslaving them, but did not bargain well with them at all. His most requested distillate, Neriakian vodka, was also the most difficult to make. But, here he had one of his favorites, Ol’t’s Ale. If he weren’t so busy he might even try to practice his skills some more. He enjoyed so few things that did not involve blood or battle, it was good to focus in on something different every now and then.<br>
<br>
Even the voice of the Goblet was unusually quite this evening. It was as if the artifact was gathering it’s strength. As if it knew something was about to happen and wanted Zirrix to be rested and fully ready to meet any challenge. Zirrix did not mind, so many things had happened of late. He was about to enter his 30th season as a Warrior. From many of the lesser races, that would have made him an old man. But, Teir’dal lived for many centuries, sometimes even for a millennia. Time did little to ravage the appearance of a member of the Respected Race. None the less, there were not many “old” Teir’dal. That did not bother Zirrix either, in Norrath, death was not always a permanent state of affairs. Leaning back he finished his drink and looked at his most recent acquisition.<br>
<br>
It was a non descript leather hood. It looked like one any common laborer would wear. But, looks where deceiving in this case. He had acquired a most powerful and exotic item. Crafted by dark magics deep within the pits of the Froglock stronghold of Lower Guk, this objects worn and dirty appearance was a lie. In fact, it was one of the more desired items amongst the Warriors of all races. It was known as an Executioners Hood, and held several mighty enchantments. The wearer of this item not only found their physical strength increased, but their hand/eye co-ordination greatly improved. With this garment, unattractive as it was, a skilled Warrior could become a killing machine of horrifying proportions. Zirrix had to trade his beloved Crown of Blacked Iron for it, along with a sum in platinum, but it was well worth it. Feeling the lateness of the hour, Zirrix stood and picked up his newest prize. Moving off to his suite of private apartments, he decided to get to sleep early. Thus, he could arise that much earlier tomorrow and see just how much more his skill benefited from the use of this new device. Tomorrow, he would roam the Commonlands and search for prey.   <br>

While it was true that their Royal Majesties held the real and absolute power over all Teir’dal, it was the Council of Nobles who actually ran the government. The Council acted as “advisors” to the King and Queen when asked. They also keep a close eye on each other and worked to insure sociological stability for a race of evil beings born of chaos. So they spoke, each in their turn, relating the condition of whatever aspect of Neriakian life they held sway over. Currently it was the representative of House F’lok, the “bankers” of Neriak. Current fiscal situation, currency value and Norrathian market trends were all being detailed. Unlike the lightcrawler races, the nobles of the Teir’dal worked for their people. They also used and discarded them when nessacary. Zirrix was in charge of the Indigo Brotherhood forces and their various divisions. From the City Guards to the Forest Legion, he kept track of them and prepared various reports. Many had thought that with the extermination of the Obsidian Blade Zirrix would likewise “disappear”. <br>
<br>
Many on the Council, some who had “disappeared” themselves, had found out how wrong they were. The nobles had gone, as the dwarves were fond of saying, “Off the ledge and into the pit”. Now, the known members of the Blade, with the notable exception of Zirrix, had simply faded away. Like shadows at night, they were around every corner, but could not be seen. Now, they truly were the unseen of Neriak. Zirrix, becoming bored of economic reports, looked around the Council Chambers.<br>
<br>
They were inside the 3rd gate, in one of the upper rooms of the Spires of Innoruuk. Since it was the Clerics who acted as the administrative force of Neriak, it only made sense to locate the Council Chambers within their Temple. Also, being so close to the power of the Dark Creator, the Council’s decisions could be influenced by his unholy will. At least that was what the commoners believed. The Council Chambers was a large room made out of, all things, obsidian stone. Gold and platinum bas reliefs showed legendary heroes performing fabled feats, throughout history, that raised Neriak to the powerful city it was today. The members sat around a many pointed star shaped table carved of alabaster. A sharp contrast to the walls of the Chamber. A soft lavender/blue glow lit the room. The magical lightsource had no point of creation and seemed to just emanate throughout the Chamber. Each Council member sat in a wooden chair made from some dark, polished wood that always seemed to radiate warmth. The cushions where of deep scarlet and both soft and supportive. An enchantment insured that the chairs never squeaked or made a scratching sound when moved along the Chambers floor. Behind each chair, the various House banners hung in tribute. Many colors and strange designs were imprinted on fabrics of the finest quality. Near each Council members place, was a decanter of whatever favorite libation that particular Council member enjoyed. The most trusted Cleric initiates stood by, in absolute silence, to dart in and out with relevant papers regarding whatever matter was currently being discussed.<br>
<br>
There were no personal servants allowed, no personal guards either. Here, they were all equal, all had the same voice. The 13 strongest Houses of Neriak, assembled together for deliberations. True, the more powerful Houses could influence and carry a vote, but all representative paid each other the same respect. The representative of the strongest House bowed, in greeting, to the least powerful. Outside the Chambers, it was conspiracy and treachery that was the order of business, but not here. Here, each representative worked for the benefit of all Neriak. Problems arose, on occasion, when one House’s impression of what was best, did not coincide with what another House’s representative may have thought. But, in the end, the vote was always taken and the Council’s “recommendation” was submitted to their Royal Highnesses for their approval or denial. What ever the outcome one thing was certain, it would be in the best interests of the Respected Race that the Council of Nobles acted. <br>
<br>
Mostly because they knew what they were doing, but finally because the only alternative to not following the rules of the Council and the dictates of the King and Queen, was immediate execution. An unfortunate few would escape death and become outcast, their names forgotten, erased from all records and archives of Neriak. These “traitors” would be fair game for any Teir’dal in Norrath. Yes, death was far preferable to the pathetic existence of an outcast. As the meeting finished and the prayers to the Dark Father were said, each member returned into the dark of Neriak. Returned to their Estates until the next Council meeting was called, returned home.         <br>

It was a simple statement, said as a matter of fact, by the Matron of the Shadows of the Blade. Zirrix’s expression did not change, after all, did he not face death everyday, at every turn. He was a Warrior and death was his closest companion. Always there, always following, always waiting for a chance to come for a visit. Lifting his head proudly he said, “As my Matron wishes, where and how?”. Grinning, Matron Morrigu said, “Ah, my faithful general even onto death”. Leaning forward she beckoned the general close and explained her plan. At the end of the conversation she dismissed him, arranging to meet with him later that night in the Eastern Commonlands, so that they may begin their search for the Druid thief Dreth. <br>
<br>
They had found him, as they knew they would, and had chased him all the way to the Oasis of Marr. There, the thief had been joined other lightcrawlers and the chase halted. Searching the crowd of inferiors, Zirrix saw the one the Matron had told him about. Another Druid, Iceliannlia, older and more seasoned then the thief Dreth or even Zirrix himself. Adjusting the enchanted necklace his Matron had given him, Zirrix stepped forward and goaded the older Druid. True to form, given their limited comprehension for things, the Druid had challenged him to a duel. Everyone knew the outcome, this Druid may have been a lightcrawler, but she was still about 10 seasons more experienced then Zirrix. As usual, the weakling lightcrawlers showed their cowardice and stupidity by attempting to prove their skill in a uneven combat. Zirrix spit in the lightcrawlers face and the battle commenced. Despite the Druid’s advantage, Zirrix cut her down to the breaking point. Casting her final spell, in desperation and fear, she defeated Zirrix, or so she believed. As Zirrix fell, he could feel rather then see, the necklace he wore suddenly pulse with unholy power.<br>
<br>
Zirrix did not like magic, did not trust it, but his Matron had tried to explain it to him earlier when she gave him the pendant. Apparently, in order to compel the Druid thief Dreth to obey her, Morrigu needed to hold some part of his power. Teir’dal did not have Druids in their ranks. The whore-goddess Tunare was out of the reach of the respected Race. But, not her children. The pendant Zirrix wore would “capture” some small essence of Drudic power. This power would then be used by Morrigu to act as a wedge into the thief’s soul. In this way, Morrigu could use the power of Tunare against the Druid thief and gain what she wished. She told Zirrx that his “death” would serve to activate the pendant and allow it to perform it’s fell magics. Zirrix would not actually die, his spirit would be transported to a receptacle, safe in the Spires of Innoruuk at Neriak. The Clerics there would then return his soul to his body. <br>
<br>
As he fell into darkness, Zirrix saw the look of ecstasy on the face of his Matron and knew that her plan had worked. They had used the lightcrawlers greed and pride to serve their own purposes. Some time later, Zirrix woke again in the Oasis, only now he was surrounded by Dark Clerics. Everyone else had long since departed. Zirrix arose from his “death” and he knew in his heart  that the deed had been done. Now the Shadows could prepare for the next stage of their plan. In a rare showing of emotion, Zirrix smiled in the black warm night of the Oasian desert.<br>

He watched the decaying undead shamble across the desert landscape. These were the remnants of the living who had perished here in the pitiless desert. Either through thirst or battle, they had seen the rise of their last living sun in this desolate place. For them, death brought no peace. Whether through punishment or sheer force of will, these unfortunates were cursed to wander the sands of this sweltering dustbin for all time. They would mindlessly attack any living thing, to vent their hatred at their own existence, taking what little pleasure they could from raining death upon all who crossed their paths. The few that were lucky would be destroyed in combat with a superior foe. As the last of their essence was spent in combat, their spirits would finally break free from it’s skeletal prison. All that was left would be a pile of dust and bone shards. Sometimes a rusty old weapon, to be the prize of the one that vanquished them. Otherwise, there would be no trace left of them at all. On occasion, one of the properly interned, commonly known as a Mummy would be seen traveling the landscape. These were nobles or the wealthy elite of some long past desert civilization. Laying dormant for thousands of years, they would be awakened from their eternal slumber. Either the fulfillment of some long forgotten curse, or the behest of a powerful Deathmaster (called Necromancer among the living), would call them forth. Then they too would wander the shifting sands, looking for the living to slay. If they were lucky, their tragic mockery of life would be cut short by some stalwart adventurer. Their spirits to fade into the tapestry of time. But, the dead were not the only desert inhabitants.<br>
<br>
Little better were the wretched Madmen. These humanoids would stumble and crawl through the inferno of the day and the frigid cold of the night searching for answers to questions that have yet to be asked. Driven insane, either through their own devices or with some sinister aid, these lost souls would travel their endless journey to nowhere and not even remember the path they took to get there. Guilt, anguish or just common madness, who knows what sparked their decent into lunacy, but whatever the reason, few ever found their way home again. Most would fall one day, only to rise as one of the undead, doomed to continue their tortured trek, always walking, never to arrive. Such was the harsh mosaic that comprised the Desert of Ro. Only tribes of a few scattered groups of Desert Nomads would call this place home. Even they represented the cruelty of their surrounding by being known as the most ruthless and bloodthirsty bandits in all of Norrath. Sprinkle this with a generous helping of  giant versions of the most poisonous insects and you would complete the portrait. Deeper inland, towards the so called fertile area, were several tribes of vicious Orcs. These mostly keep to themselves and warred with the Trolls and Ogres of the South. Even they rarely ventured into the Desert. No one came here unless they must.<br>
<br>
Zirrix’s eyes closed to slits as he cursed his bad luck. He had been here almost two weeks and still there was no sign of the Sand Giant Hassum. He needed the messages that that mountainous monstrosity carried. This was not part of any military campaign, instead it was a personal mission. With his House’s resources, he could easily pay someone else to obtain what he wanted, but he preferred to keep his personal endeavors private. He had seen others searching for Hassum as well, but they had left empty-handed. Zirrix was different, he would wait. The Gods themselves could pack up and go home, but he would wait. Years of warring and almost constant battle gave him patience. Like the rock walls that surrounded him Zirrix would keep his vigil. He would wait and then, soon he believed, he would complete his quest and obtain his prize. Then he would, as always, seek new prey to hone his skills.           <br>

He was hunting in the Western Commonlands and was doing well. Now was the time he exacted vengeance against these flying mutations for all the years of sneak attacks. Often, as he was growing in skill and power, he would be ambushed by these eagle/lion crossbred winged vermin, and would have to make a hasty escape. Sometimes he suffered grievous injury before he got away. Now, he hunted these Griffins for vengeance’s sake. Soon, his skill would be such that he would be able to hunt an even more hated enemy. The Sand Giants of the Great Ro Deserts. Even now, the thought of slaughtering them make his hands shake in anticipation. How often had those monstrosities harassed and harmed him over the decades. Well, soon he would be able to hunt them at his leisure. Soon he would make them pay. But, for now, he satisfied himself with the extermination of these flying menaces. He also had begun to seek Hill Giants for prey. These were the weaker cousins of the Sand Giants, but they would be good practice for him. As his eyes settled at a pair of feathered wings flapping in the distance, his guild symbol began to hum. <br>
<br>
The symbol of the Shadows of the Blade was under is armor, against his chest, and would vibrate slightly when summoning. While any member of the Shadows could communicate through them, only the leaders of the guild could utilize them to summon. Finding a safe spot, Zirrix fell into the light trace that would allow him to psychically communicate with his Brothers and Sisters of the guild. All guilds in Norrath had this ability, only the medium though which the psychic plane was tapped was different. It was based on the person trying to connect. It was known Druids used the land as a medium. Warrior used the elements of mithral, steel and iron. The Clerics used the stars and the Shamans the air. No one knew exactly how Wizards connected, but they did none the less. It didn’t matter which guild, each member had their own unique method of reaching out. As Zirrix sent out his mind he “felt” the voice of his Matron, Morrigu of House W’Rath touch his mind. “General, there is a problem. Something threatens the Shadows of the Blade. We must meet together and deal with this problem. Come to us now…” As the message ended, Zirrix knew instinctively where to go. There he would find his other Brothers and Sisters of the Shadows assembled, prepared to do his Matrons bidding. <br>
<br>
Standing, Zirrix looked and saw his almost prey moving off into the distance. With a snarl he swore, “Another day I shall rip your life from you, another day I shall find you again”. Turning, Zirrix began to run to the place were his guild was forming. There he would be told what dangers faced his family. There he would decide the best way to utterly and completely destroy that threat. With the prospect of bloodshed on his mind, his pace quickened with anticipation…   <br>

There were four other adventurers, a hunting party by the looks of them, engaged in battle. There was an Erudite Caster, a High Elven Cleric and one Dwarven and one Human Warrior. They were fighting a Sand Giant, and it looked as if the Sand Giant was winning. Zirrix could tell from their equipment that all the hunters were either in their late twentieth or early thirtieth seasons. It looked as if the Sand Giant was just past half-dead, but the party was certainly doomed. Unless someone came to their aid, they would be wiped out. If almost on cue, the High Elven Cleric looked up and saw Zirrix on the Dune. A look of relief crossed her face, as she thought that the tide had changed. Zirrix stood for a moment longer then slowly sheathed his sword and sat down. The look on the Clerics face went from relief, to questioning, to indignant fury as she realized Zirrix would not help her and her doomed group. They were inferiors and if some Sand Giant was happy enough to exterminate them, so much the better. It would save the Teir’dal from having to do it themselves. It was bad enough that, on occasion, Zirrix had to group with these inferiors because they had some use, but he had no intention of putting himself at risk now. He had no intention of saving the enemies of his people. They had taken on more then they could handle and now they would pay the price for their stupidity.<br>
<br>
As the first Warrior, the Human fell, the true nature of the party showed itself. The Erudite, obviously the smartest of the group, stepped back and cast a spell. Zirrix had seen the gate spell cast many times before and knew that he had run to save himself and let his party die. Next was the Cleric, who rather then gate, cast a spell of invulnerability upon herself and ran into the desert. Finally the Dwarf, knowing he was doomed, ran toward a nearby party, in hopes that the Giant would break off it’s attack on him and assault the other party. Typical, thought Zirrix, when they are together and strong they make a lot of noise about loyalty and honor. The rant about being “Good”, fair and just. But, when pressed into a corner, they drop their high talk and run squealing like the vermin they all are. As the Dwarf fell dead, Zirrix stood and withdrew his sword. These fools had thought he would help them kill a  Sand Giant for what? No experience, no treasure? The idiots would probably have thanked him and praised him for his skill. Better to let the weak die then to pollute the strong with their disease.<br>
<br>
As Zirrix closed on the wounded Sand Giant he thought two things. First, how much he would enjoy slaughtering this monstrosity, as he had seen so many of the Respected Race likewise slaughtered by other Sand Giants. Second, he thought that it was time to find a pool of fresh water, he was getting thirsty and it was time to refill his canteen. The howl of the Sand Giant, as Zirrix’s sword sank deep into it’s thigh, was all the praise any Warrior of Rallos Zek would ever need.<br>

Snarling obscenities at the accursed shinning orb, Zirrix pulled his cape closer about him and wrapped his face in the hood. He could stand the heat and light, he had been adventuring for a long time, but his capacity for tolerance did not translate into comfort. He was Teir’dal and preferred the cool, dry, darkness of the under-realms to this hot, wet upper-world. Since he had been hunting in foreign lands since he was young, he could stand the abusive climates in the various lands of Norrath. Many of the Respected Race could not even venture out beyond the gloomy protectiveness of the Neriak Forest. Just as well, after Norrath has been conquered, the Teir’dal would not be bothered with having to leave their home city at all. Appointed representatives from the enslaved races could execute the will of the Respected Race when the time came. That would suit Zirrix just fine. As his eyes made the shift from the ultraviolet spectrum, he winced at the pain. It always hurt Teir’dal eyes to be forced to see in the “normal” spectrum of light. Shaking his head, to clear the pain, Zirrix saw a group of adventurers further down the coast standing around something that had just washed up on the shore. Zirrix moved in for a closer look.<br>
<br>
The something was actually a person, High Elven by the look of him, or rather what was left of him. It was obvious that he was the survivor of some shipwreck. He had looked to have been in the water a few days. His clothes were rags hanging on an emaciated frame. It seems at least one sea beast had taken a bite or two out of the wretch. Zirrix turned to leave when he heard the thing croak out something. It spoke in an agonized, gibbering whine that took tremendous effort. In a low tone, the Elf was obviously about to die, it said something like “The lost land…the forgotten Lizardmen…Save yourselves from the doom of the Iskar”. With that, the man arched his back and died. Zirrix turned and began to return to the docks. As he walked he thought about what the wretch had said. Strange, the Elf should talk about myths before he died. Zirrix knew the stories of the mythical land of…well, he forgot the places name, but it was said to be the home of the Iskar. <br>
<br>
The Iskar were a fabled race of Lizardmen who had an empire far across the Turbinus Sea. It was said to have fallen at the beginnings of the Combine Empire hundreds of years ago. Their supposed Empire stretched across the entire continent. They were said to be powerful fighters and worshipped some dark, foreboding God. Who they really were, if they existed at all, and why their Empire fell is unknown.  On occasion, sailors would come back after being lost as sea due to some storm swearing they had sighted the lost continent. The stories usually only lasted as long as the free drinks did at the nearby tavern. As Zirrix reached the docks, he turned to look east over the waters of the sea. What secrets lay there he wondered. What strange beasts and treasure would be hidden in the ruins of a long dead kingdom? Shrugging, Zirrix decided the dying Elf must have been delirious, there was nothing out there but water. Turning back to face into the desert, he looked for some prey. Even if there was some new lands out past the Easterly waves, this land need to be conquered first. <br>
<br>
The thought lingered, “Still, it would be a change of pace”. Seeing movement in the distant sands, Zirrix drew his sword and headed off. As he ran into the desert he thought of the old Erudite saying,  “Time enough for dreams when we sleep”. Zirrix had more important things on his mind right now.       <br>

<br>
Greetings,<br>
<br>
I stood on the Bridge of Tears in the Nektulos Forest and looked into the trees. It was evening here on the outskirts of the city of Neriak. It was hard to tell though because here in the Forest it was always dark. Even in the midday sun, the Forest was dark and dank, little light touched the soft damp ground. Also a perpetual fog shrouded the entire area, making it continually wet and sodden. There was little, if any, difference between day and night in the Teir’dal Forest. I had been hunting in the Deserts of Ro, but my hunts had not been profitable. I saw neither the Sand Giant messenger Hassum, nor was able to find a party to hunt the Ancient Cyclops. All in all, it was a few weeks wasted. Then I had received the report from the Indigo Brotherhood. Apparently certain spies, in the Rouges guild, had learned of a plot to infiltrate the Nektulos Forest. Some lightcrawlers had some clandestine business with the Halflings that inhabited the Western reaches of the Forest. As a member of the General Staff and commander the City Guards, I decided to return home and oversee operations.<br>
<br>
Gaining what information I could, I stationed myself on the Bridge of Tears and waited. I did not have to wait long. It was only a little while before the cry was raised, “Intruders, Intruders in our Forest”. At that point, various Hunter/Killer groups of Teir’dal were sent into the Forest to find the enemy. First they were spotted near the Halfling camps. They were identified as the accursed Silver Shadows. A group of Lightcrawlers who made it their business to interfere in the matters of the Respected Race. The recon report told of a party of five or six. There were Halflings, Humans and at least two High Elves. They were a mixed group of Casters and Clerics. They had been interrupted in their dealings with the wretched Halflings and had retreated into the Forest. A second group of Teir’dal  was dispatched to guard the river banks. Again the agents of the Silver Shadows were spotted and the hunt was on.<br>
<br>
They had tried to re-group at the Wizard platform, but had been discovered and had to flee. Finally, the Teir’dal converged and set upon the intruders. Seeing they were overpowered, the cowardly wretches ran for the safety of the Lavastorm mountains. The group of brave and heroic Teir’dal harried them and chased them all the way through the gardens of broken stone. After a short time the Children of Neriak were victorious, naturally, and the enemies were driven from our Forest. It seems obvious that the Silver Shadows were engaged in some conspiracy with the Halflings of the Western Wall to harm the Respected Race. Our vigilant defense thwarted their pathetic efforts and they were sent scurrying into a chaotic retreat. They were last seen running blindly into the Lavastorm mountains, there to reflect on their folly. Once again, the Respected Race showed it’s superiority. I recommend we launch a series of punishment raids on the various Halfling camps to teach them the error of their ways. End Report.<br>

He had picked the troops himself and brought along a company of War Wizards and Clerics. The Halflings of the Western Wall had always been tolerated, both as merchants and targets. Their recent treachery against the Respected Race would be revenged in the appropriate matter. One-third of them were to be slaughtered, one-third taken as slaves and one third would be beaten and tortured, to teach them the error of their ways. His troops knew what was expected of them and were eager for the task. As Zirrix approached the camps, he sensed something wrong. He dispatched a scout, to recon ahead and see what was happening in the camps. The scout returned a short time later, seemingly confused. He reported to the General that the Halflings seemed to have vanished. There were none about, no fires burning in tents, nothing. Zirrix replied that they were just hiding and led his force into the camps. But, it was as the scout had reported, the camp was emptied of Halflings and their belongings. As Zirrix stalked through the camp, he came to the leaders tent. Nailed to the main support was a piece wood with writing on it. The sign read in the Teir’dal language, “Gone Fishin’, sorry we missed ye, be back later and have a nice day”, and had a smiling face drawn underneath the words. Zirrix’s eyes narrowed to slits as he looked off to the south, toward the Eastern Commons. Turning, he called over his aide, they would not get away so easily.<br>
<br>
Zirrix ordered, “Burn the tents, and send for a detachment from the Lodge of the Dead.  Have the Clerics  poison the soil, have the Wizards burn the trees to ashes and when the Necromancers arrive, have them bury a legion of undead nearby”. As Zirrix watched his orders being carried out he thought  to himself, “Yes my little runts, when you return and rebuild your camps, there will be many unpleasant suprises that will rise to greet you in the night”. Calling over his aide he ordered that once they finished here, they are to proceed to the Halfling city of Riverdale. There, a more “Notable” example of their vengeance will be manifested. Zirrix would go on ahead, and prepare an attack plan. As his men continued their work, Zirrix turned South. Heading toward the East Commons pass, he considered things to come.<br>
<br>
Norrath was changing, great forces were in play. There was something about to happen. Zirrix did not know what, but he could sense it. He also somehow knew that when this thing happened, Norrath would never be the same. As the Humans say, it was “The calm before the storm”. For too long the “background” inhabitants of Norrath were content just to sit by in ignorance. This situation was the perfect example. Did the West Wall Halflings think they could just run and hide behind the walls of Riverdale, did they believe that would save them? What about the people of Riverdale itself. Did they believe they could harbor those who conspired against the Respect Race, with no concern for the consequences? Fools. The Children of Neriak where everywhere, there was no place to hide from their grasp. Where ever there was a dark, hidden corner, we were there. Where ever there was a frightened family in the night, we were there. Where ever there was a patch of shadow, we were there, watching, waiting. Now Zirrix would go to Riverdale and show them why they were afraid. He would show them and they would remember in waking nightmares. As his pulse quickened at thoughts of what was to come, Zirrix  broke into a run, hurrying to the vengeance that was rightfully his.       <br>

The Wizard looked back and grinned evilly. The Wizards name was Xrath and had meet Zirrix just outside the Halfling city of Rivervale. He was young as Wizards go, far younger then Zirrix’s brother Tzlar, but had the same glittering ambition deep in his violet eyes. Xrath was traveling to the Western Coast of Antonica for some quest. Zirrix had come upon him when one of the minor wandering undead of Kithilcor Forest had made an appearance and was assaulting Xrath. Zirrix had dispatched it and the young Wizard wished to repay his debt. Even though Teir’dal society was built upon a complex web of interconnecting obligations and fealties, most of the Respected Race did not like to be personally indebted to a stranger. That was why Zirrix had helped the Wizard to begin with, he knew the obligation would benefit him. Looking at the Wizard Zirrix said, “ I have matters to attend to in Rivervale, but I do not wish to be “noticed” until it is a time of my choosing. As payment for your debt, you will enspell me with a cloak of invisibility, such that I may proceed to my purpose”. The Wizard smiled, it was an easy casting and would drain his magical reserve very little. Reminding Zirrix that: 1) The moment he took any offensive action, the spell would cancel and he would become visible, and 2) The enchantment was unpredictable and could dispel at any time, he began his casting. As Zirrix faded from sight, he thanked the young Wizard and entered the crevasse that led to the city of Rivervale.<br>
<br>
As Zirrix emerged into the open sunlight of the courtyard, he shielded his eyes. It was almost latesun here in Rivervale. Zirrix had left the gloomy darkness of the Kithilcor Forest only a few moments ago. Such was the world of Norrath. As his eyes adjusted to the burning brightness he scanned the area. There were two guards speaking and few others about. It must be some holiday or such as the streets seemed deserted. At first, Zirrix considered that the Halflings may have been alerted to their danger. But, watching the guards, he decided that was unlikely. They seemed more bored then anxious. One guard was older and had better armor. He looked to be an officer and was probably a match for Zirrix. Normally that wouldn’t stop Zirrix, he did so enjoy killing someone of equal or higher experience. But, here in the city, he knew the other guards would swarm upon him and he would be overwhelmed. No, he would wait, providing his invisibility did not dissipate. After a few minutes, the older guard moved off and the younger came back to his post near the entrance. Zirrix stood still as the guard walked within a hairs breath of him. <br>
<br>
The guard looked to be a few seasons below Zirrix, but not a green recruit. Zirrix thought back to his own soldiers in the Nektulos Forest and snarled a silent curse. How many times had the cowardly lightcrawlers crept  into the Nektulos Forest and ambushed, en masse, the newly appointed sentries. Looking at the guard, Zirrix thought, “Time for a small measure of our vengeance”. Standing in front of the guard, Zirrix reached out and slapped him across the face. He could tell he reappeared when the look of surprise on the guards face turned into one of fear and hatred. The guard pulled his weapon, accusing Zirrix of ruining the Halfling’s land and struck at the Teir’dal Warrior. But, Zirrix was more skilled and in a short time, the guard lay dead. As Zirrix looked at the corpse, he heard a surprised squeak from behind him. Turning he saw a Halfling mother and her young child. If the Mother’s eyes where filled with fear, then the child’s was filled with terror. Moving in a blur, Zirrix clamped his hands over the Mother’s mouth and pulled her into a solid grip with one arm, and impaled the child on his sword with the other. Forcing the mother to watch, Zirrix lifted his blade and shook it so the wriggling, gurgling child slowly slid down to the hilt. Holding her there for a few minutes, Zirrix whispered that he was sent to kill her and her people. He told here that from here, he would sneak to her house and await the rest of her family, where he would spend all night with them, all the long night. As the child stopped moving, Zirrix flung it’s lifeless body into the entrance tunnel and released the mother. <br>
<br>
Waiting just long enough to enjoy the look of horror and anguish in the mothers eyes, Zirrix swung his blade and decapitated her. As her corpse fell to the ground, Zirrix quickly picked up the dying head and looking into it’s dimming eyes said, “Yes mother, all the long night”. After a few moments, seeing no one else was near, Zirrix allowed himself a small smile. He did not usually torment his victims before he killed them, but he was in a good mood and just found the pleasure impossible to suppress. Zirrix did so enjoy a good jest. Dragging the headless body of the mother and the dead guard into the secluded tunnel, he put them next to the child. Next he removed both the guards head and the child’s and put them over to the side. He then though a moment. There were four, no five intruders that entered the Nektulos Forest a few nights past. Zirrix looked down, three heads now, two more to go. He would then prop all of them up on a nearby rock on the Western wall for all to see. He would also leave a note. When the Halflings emerged from their homes to enjoy the sunset, as was their custom during the summer, they would be greeted with a sunset they would not soon forget. A short time later, after killing a merchant and some wander old Grandfather of a hobbit, he waited until all was quiet, glad the old guard hadn’t returned to check on the younger one. As the Halflings went inside for lastmeal and cleared the area, Zirrix arranged his “Presents” and left the note. <br>
<br>
Going back and standing at the exit to the Kithilcor Forest, Zirrix let out a shout of alarm, in Halfling, and ran into the forest. As he entered the forest, he could hear the first shrieks  of horror coming from the people of Rivervale. Once in the forest, he headed back toward the Western Common lands. He thought of the note he left with the heads, it read in Halfling, “You forgot to take bait for your fishing trip. Use these instead, and have pleasant dreams”. Underneath it, he had drawn the picture of a Halfling’s smiling head, resting on a bed. As Zirrix ran through the Forest he decided to brush up on his Halfling, he had a feeling he may have need to write some more notes…           <br>

Holding his head up high in victory, he relished the admiring looks from the other hunting parties. He was in the Courtyard of the Forgotten Temple of Cazic-Thule. Around him were a few other hunting parties composed of lower seasoned adventurers. He had just lured out not one, but two heavily armed Lizardmen from the maze. Standing toe to toe, Zirrix had killed them both in brutal combat. The first had tried to run, to seek the aid of more of it’s scaled kind, but it had not gotten far. Many of the adventurers watching him had to form whole parties just to kill one Lizardman, here he was killing two single-handedly. Granted he had been wounded, but still he stood over the corpses, victorious. Zirrix was just preparing to seek more prey when his amulet began to vibrate. The emblem of the Shadows of the Blade was concealed beneath his Crafted Breastplate. The vibrations told of a summons by his Matron, Morrigu of House W’Rath. Finding a secluded spot, Zirrix sat down and began the meditation that would allow him to communicate with his Matron. After a few moments her presence and voice coalesced in his mind. The image said “General, an issue of some importance to the Teir’dal has arisen.…Return to Neriak immediately”. Zirrix sent a mental confirmation and, after bribing a Shaman for a wolfspeed spell, headed North back to his home.<br>
<br>
Some time later, several members of the Shadows of the Blade sat in their recently acquired secret lair as the Matron addressed them. Zirrix listened to the tale of the Golden Egg and the Zan Fi Monks quest. Several members of the Blade did not wish to help, until it was revealed that Innorukk was involved as well. The Dark Creator was sealed in the Citadel just as were the other Gods. Even the Great Battle God Rallos Zek, his God, was imprisoned in a place beyond the stars. The Matron explained that it would be folly to leave a bunch of fence sitting Human Monks with the responsibility of this task. Obviously they knew their own inadequacies and had wisely sought the assistance of the Respected Race. As usual, it would be the children of Neriak who would have to rise to the task. Zirrix pointed out to his Guildmates that it made sense. Because after all, since Norrath was destine to belong to the Teir’dal alone, it was only logical that they be the ones to save it. By releasing the Gods, the Teir’dal would again show their inherent superiority to the lightcrawler races. This would give further proof of their right to rule all.<br>
<br>
Matron Morrigu gave the final facts to her Blades. They would meet tomorrow at firstlight in the Lavastorm Mountains. From there they would find out what little the Monks knew and then they would start their search. The Matron advised them that cunning and thought would be more useful weapons in this endeavor then sword and spell. A Rogue was involved and therefore it was a matter of stealth. Dismissing her Blades she remarked that none knew the secrets of Shadows better then the those who lived within them. Tomorrow the Gods, ALL the Gods, would look upon the Teir’dal and marvel at the ability of Innorukk’s Created. Tomorrow<br>
