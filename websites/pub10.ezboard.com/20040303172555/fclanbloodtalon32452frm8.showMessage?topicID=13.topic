When you Charm the Spectral Librarian and give it the Dull Diamond it returns an Enchanted Diamond and then gets upset and turns into an Enraged Spectral Librarian.<br>
<br>
You do NOT have to kill this Enraged Spectral Librarian to get it's essence It is quite easy to get into the Library. Basically you enter Kaesora, cast invis, go straight forwards, drop down the hole with levitate, don't go <br>
all the way down, just head forwards onto the ledge in front that you can see. Face directly away from the door, enter the room with the 3 spiders and turn right and go thru that door. Directly behind the door there is a secret<br>
wall, go through that and then *just* before you hit the corner, cast invis undead. Follow the passage going down until you come to a large area with a building. Inside that building is the Spectral Librarian, or the Tortured<br>
Librarian. Not sure on which one is the place holder, as the Tortured Librarian dropped a Kunzar Cloak, so perhaps he is the rare and the spectral librarian is the place holder.<br>
<br>
On a side note, if you go up to the 2nd floor of the Library you can also pick up a piece of the Medallion needed to enter Veeshan's Peak.<br>
<br>
You: 'What sapphire ?'<br>
Nadia Starfeast: 'Here is the sapphire that I have prepared for you. Take it and give it to the one referred to as the Golden Faerie.<br>
You receive A Dull Sapphire.<br>
Faelia Goldenwing - Skyfire (1550, -1000)<br>
She's a tiny Chromodrac. Skyfire is exactly like Trakanons Teeth. Consider Faelia to be the Skyfire version of the Froglok Forager/Hunter spawns. <br>
With a druid/ranger you can pull the funky spawns and eventually you will get her. All of these spawn near the Burning Woods zone and people who camp that area see her dozens of times a day. Mobs there will agro her and kill <br>
her soon after she pops<br>
<br>
You: 'What ruby?'<br>
Nadia Starfeast: 'Blood red is the ruby that I have given you. The city that you must travel to has no sun, but still a day and night. And at night, the mist could suffocate one. Tis the fate of poor Jaxion.<br>
You receive A Dull Ruby<br>
<br>
Wraith of Jaxion - City of Mist<br>
The Wraith of Jaxion spawns at the final building (the one that the last reaver and Neh'Ashiir spawns in). The wraith has a placeholder, and it goes around the building. Keep killing everything in that last building once you<br>
have cleared the reaver, and the Wraith of Jaxion should spawn eventually.<br>
<br>
You: 'What emerald?'<br>
Nadia Starfeast jumps. Eeekk... a scorpian. I thought they rid this area of these critters. Those things give me the creepers. Take this emerald and be on your way.<br>
You receive A Dull Emerald.<br>
<br>
Emerald<br>
Impaler Tzilug - Overthere (-91, 814, -502)<br>
A Level 51 named Scorpian with five (5) guardians.<br>
<br>
It is not necessary to kill anything to receive the emerald. If your Venril Sathir faction is high enough you may not even have to charm Impaler Tzilug.<br>
However if it's not here's one strategy I have heard. Have a cleric run up to the guardians under the effect of Divine Aura. Being Invulnerable(s)he can &quot;tank&quot; while you mesmerize/enthrall/entrance the guardians, charm<br>
Tzilug, hand him the emerald, and get out.<br>
Another strategy for charming Tzilug is to have a druid pull him by casting harmony on his guards to get him alone.<br>
<br>
Yet Another strategy is to just cast Rune on yourself, run in Flux, AE Mes, charm and get out Emerald to a Scorpion - Overthere give the emerald to Impaler Tzilug guarded by Scorpikis Guardians spawn after charming him you will get an enchanted emerald in return.<br>

You receive Jeb's Seal back.<br>

You: 'I am ready for the test of the phantasm'<br>
Polzin Mrid: 'It will be simple, go collect these items and return them to me. Head of a serpent, essence of a ghost, essence of a vampire, and sands of the mystics. Do so and you will receive the last of the pieces. Be sure<br>
to combine them in a sack first. Just ask and I will provide you with one.<br>
<br>
You: 'What is the head of a serpent?'<br>
Polzin Mrid: 'Serpent is probably not an accurate term form what you must return to me. It is actaully the reminants of a spirit. The spirit is one which was erradicated long long ago by the Iksar. I believe they were called the Shissar. You may need to travel to the Iksar city to learn more about these creatures.<br>

Male &amp; Female Forsaken Revenants - Plane of Hate<br>
<br>
<br>
You: 'What sands of the mystics ?'<br>
Polzin Mrid: 'They are sands that were imbued with the magical might of the mystics. Mystics use a ritual involving their own blood to create a powerful<br>
bond with the sand. One will need to search the shores.<br>
<br>
