I spent a good 10 minutes unloading and reloading with items I could afford to lose, hehe.<br>
<br>
With Harl and I shaking in our boots, we portaled out to the Black Dominion and started around the Rim to AB. Dia had told us that we were going to sneak in without any trouble, but I have heard SO many horror stories.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, we should have paid heed to Dia, as usual. The biggest thing we saw was one extas lugie, and we cut a wide path around him, no problem.<br>
<br>
Upon entering AB, we went and visited the famous duo of Claude and Leopold and got our masks repaired. We looked like three china-dolls standing there and were acting like kids at Christmas, it was FUN!<br>
<br>
Thanks you Dia and Harl for the fun and the great trip out!<br>

I'm pretty happy with this run, I believe no one has ever got in danger on the way.<br>
We really look silly now with our virindi masks. But the stats on them are great! It gives a +25 to melee def, al 120 (will have to imp it), and great elemental protection. Only 300 burden and uses less mana than the superior helm.<br>

Last night was a roller coster ride! I had heard horror story after horror story about running the gauntlet through the dreadlands! I knew Wamab had done so successfully at a rather low lvl but Wamba has always been a very special kind of person! I tried mock confidence but I think Celeroy saw through the guise. I found out that the only thing I have to fear is being spoiled by you guys! The run was so easy I almost considered just hunting out in the middle of the dreads! Dia was so quick with her bow that anything we came across I barely had time to scratch for a point of two. I think more often than naught it was thier corpse I was hitting. Celeroy had to keep comming back to guard my back as I run slowly compared to him and Dia<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  The Trip in short was simply that, short and sweet. After getting to AB I found out that YES! I could use the mask! I look really funny in it and have a strong desire to run around with a dagger chasing healthy young women cackling at them, every time I put it on. Hmmm... Anyway Celeroy had decided to Log and Dia was taking off So I had her show me to a dungeon close by I could hunt at. It was an Exact copy of Metos hall the place I ahve been hunting golems for the last several lvls. I do not know if it was the new mask or just a sense of fresh adventure that kept me from harms way but it was Great!  I ventured to the regular spot and it was camped by one adventurer. I took up position on two golems and went to whacking them. Pretty soon it was eveident that two iron golems just wasn't enough. Every item I wear othe than my boots takes mana and My IV buffs always fizzle taking up comps, so I started looking for another spot in metos that would provide a faster iron golem fight rate and a higher loot efficiancy rate. I found just such a room. It was occupied by one known as Deathbolt.<br>
  I asked him if I might join him and stood patiently waiting for him to finish off the golems and give me a reply. To my shock the golems ook him out! I jumped in and started slashing! New high crits issued forth from my sword and I cackled as two spells that were thrown at me I resisted! Ha! The mask works! Soon the Golems lay melting and Deathbolt arrived. He welcomed my company and I was in for much more of a surpise than I had thought. When I had arrived he had appeared to be holding the room all by himself. I had seen no signs of anyone else the whole trip down to this place and there were no signs of anyone in here either, just Deathbolt calm cool and collected a humble smile of welcome upon his face. He would often stand back coaxing me to get more than my fair share of the kills and patiently held the golems at bay when I had to buff. In all the time I have spent in Metos I have very rarely seen someone so giving or confident. After a while we settled into a regular pace talking back and forth the whole time. Soon we were joined by one of his friends, a young woman called Lil bow, She had lost all of her items hunting matties yet her exuberance and mirth held my heart. Soon I could not help myself. I found myself standing in the tunnel entrance simply blocking golems as she fired volley after volley of arrows at the beasts. I do not know if it was the new mask that Dia and Celeroy had helped me aquire or if it was some other force watching over us but the whole time I only got hit for a few points of damage. The gods must have smiled upon us for the spawns were quick and i quickly learned from Deathbolt how to propperly pin the golems to the wall while Lil bow struck them down. I was getting no exp and this was truly a Very inneficient way to restock my items but in my heart I was so happy just simply being in the presance of these two. Niether ever complained when struck or showed any sings of frustration. that was when I heard the noise. Deathblow had just given me a mote. I told him that he needn't give me anything as I was just enjoying the smile on Lil bows face. (inning golems to the wall without swining a single blow is rather addicting.)All that I got in reply was a grin and the constant sound of motes being dropped upon my person. Deathblow a char not much younger than myself, apeared to me a experiance old warrior way beyond my years, yet happy and content in what he has been provided and the friendships he has known. I knew not any way to repay such kindness and simply continued to block the golems and enjoy in Lil bows happy go lucky attitude despite the loss of eveything she owned.<br>
 Soon the young woman lvled and had to depart, Deathblow was taking his leave to help her find new items and hunt matties. We wished eachother well and split up. It saddened me to see them leave. Other than the friendships I hold with my family in FTFL I have really not known much of friendships in this land. but hunting with those two reminded me just how precious moment of simply revling in eachothers company can be. I ended up staying and hunting a bit more, I came out after using up my mana items and losing my comps. After selling all the loot I ended up with six motes and 57000p and better than that two new friends.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
 I have to say that last night will be hard to beat! Hunting with my family and new freindships forged I am once again addicted. now ll I have to do is find a way to bind at AB and eastham at the same time<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Black Dominion (49S 66,4W) is the place we have hunted to get our masks.<br>
First floor is a library with rats, then go down to a lock door (need lockpick). Kill 2 raveners, turn right, one more ravener. Jump down for an other ravener and 2 virindi servants. Follow the hall way, kill a silver rat, and wait. 3 more raveners will come, then 2 virindi puppets and an other servant. The noise of the fight should awake the virindi master. The spawn rate of the master is good and it drops a mask on every 10 spawn I think.<br>
Fighting a master is quite exiting. Not that it is difficult, its a bad melee warrior but a great caster!<br>
It likes to cast bludgening vul 6, and then... if ever... oh my god!.... if ever it casts shockwave 6... you'll see yourself flying and flatten to the wall. It hit me once for over 170 HP; I was full health and saw the lifestone!<br>
Corpse recovery was never a problem there. We could of gotten into trouble once, when Roy got killed in the uber chest room, but we tagged along with other players and got it back no problem.<br>
So, when you'll be ready for this Crow, just tie to the Dominion and call for me or Roy. We will get you a mask in no time! </font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#6B8E23><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ugharadin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gharadin</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>12/17/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>12:46:11 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=397.topic&index=8><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Reply</FONT></A></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: AB, Claude &amp; running The Rim</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Yikes!!!
