I made a custom class too, a dark elf ranger-type. Long sword, bows, and stealth, with a little healing magic and alchemy. So far he seems like a lot of fun, but more importantly, he looks damn good! He's wearing a samurai-looking outfit of chitin and chain armor, and wielding a mean-looking dai-katana. I've been mostly playing in 1st person mode, but I keep having to switch to 3rd person just to admire myself. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I really liked the fact that the first couple of quests I've done weren't the usual Fed-Ex deliveries. One nice touch was that at one point, the local shopkeeper wouldn't talk to me until I ditched some controlled substances I'd looted from the bodies of some recently deceased smugglers. Said he didn't want any trouble from the law!<br>
<br>
I played around with alchemy a little last night, and it seems like a game in itself. Most of my attempts failed, but I'm not sure if it's because my skill is so low or if I had the ingredients wrong. I was able to make a couple of useful potions though, so now I spend more time looting plants for ingredients than I do questing and killing. <br>
<br>
I had to play around with the video settings to get it running smooth on my 1GHz T-Bird with 512 RAM and GeForce3. With shadows off, AI distance near the bottom, and view distance near max, it's a little choppy in town, but other than that it's very smooth, and it looks gorgeous. The pixel-shaded water is amazing, the screenshots don't do it justice. One little tip: some people are saying that increasing the resolution doesn't really affect frame rate all that much, and may even make it run faster. I tried going up to 1152x864, and I couldn't see any slowdown from 1024x768.<br>
<br>
I haven't had much luck getting into the official forums, Bethesda's servers must be swamped. There's a few good threads over on the Gone Gold forums, and RPGDot has a decent Morrowind forum as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6B8E23><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ucreepypete.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CreepyPete</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(5/4/02 11:31:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1108.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Morrowind</span><hr size=1> Stealth is a little bit luck and a little bit technique. I spent about 40 mins messing with it in a Lord's house for a Thieves' Guild quest (right before I started a custom redguard knight <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
Make sure no one can see you when you turn stealth on. It won't go on if someone is watching you or looking your direction. If you wait long enough behind cover (even something stupid like a pillar 5 feet away from the NPC) the NPCs begin to wander around and may turn their backs. You can tell when they've no longer looking at you because you'll be able to stealth, even if you can't see 'em at the time you try. I think the problem I have with Backstabbing is I try to get too close. I'm not so hot at judging distance in the game right now.<br>
<br>
Buy potions. Health, Cure Poison &amp; Disease &amp; water breathing if needed. The spell potions are of incredibly limited duration, so don't drink one if you're not ready to scoot at that exact moment. There are recall scrolls available pretty cheap as well, although at this point geography is not my strong suit.<br>
<br>
Read every book you can find. You can even read 'em in shops and houses because you don't have to take em to read em. Some give skill increases.<br>
<br>
Read a little more in the hint book last night, mainly about the different factions and what skills they value. Many quests have more than one solution. Sometimes the really obvious one (i.e. Get the key to a Lord's Manor by killing the guy who owns it) is not the best solution. You have to figure these out by yourself, so another good hint is to SAVE YOUR GAME. A lot and under different saves.  Just because they give you a quest doesn't mean you can do it at that time. Try it once and if it's way too hard scoot to another city and get quests from that factions' counterpart in the new city. Quests will keep just fine until you can do them. (Plus, after failing a couple of times it's very satifying to come back in 3-4 levels and do it, even if only for the &quot;How you like me now, bitch?&quot; factor. =)<br>
<br>
I think the game is big enough. Once you start wandering around outside the towns the scenery changes drastically from region to region and it's really easy to get lost. I wouldn't want to walk across the Island, put it that way. I'm hearing there are a LOT of things underwater, so I'm considering building a custom lizardman char for exploration.<br>
<br>
If you guys have questions I can answer via the hint book either post em here or email em to me and I'll get back to you ASAP. I dunno how close you have to be to Bethesda to get into their website (a block?) but it was working fine on Wednesday night. That's a good sign as this really deserves to be a blockbuster title for them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ucreepypete.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CreepyPete</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(5/5/02 12:20:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1108.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> More hints:</span><hr size=1> Read any book that costs around 150+.

Magic skills are a piece of cake to raise levels. Go buy the least mana expensive spell you can from the line you want to raise and stand next to a bed in a guild. Get a book in RL. Cast until outta mana then sleep. Repeat as needed. My spells did not get reliable (i.e. 95%+ chance to cast) until around 35%-37% in skill. If you have magic skills an Majors or Minors it's nothing to go up 2-3 charcter levels an hour doing this. I spent 2.5 hours on this last night and went from 4th level to 12th. =)<br>
<br>
DON'T steal something important and then wander around with it. If guards catch you any stolen loot goes to a secured evidence chest usually in a well guarded location. Did this with a quest item in my inventory last night and man, id it going to take some luck to get it back. Saved over my &quot;before&quot; save too. =/<br>

<br>
Played as a rogue, but with serious mana augmented abilities. Can heal, nuke, pick locks &amp; teleport. What's not to like? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6B8E23><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/usareshft.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saresh FT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(5/5/02 5:13:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1108.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: More hints:</span><hr size=1> keep giving us updates creeps..... may get this and dungeon siege once im back!!  =) <p><BR>
