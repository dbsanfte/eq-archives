<br>
It outlines rules in general, pertaining to all different subjects.<br>
It also outlines only new things, all of the old will still be used.<br>
<br>
1) You will now undergo a 2 week period which will be known as the "proving period" in order to join SCARAB.<br>
--a)During this time you are REQUIRED to attend at MINIMUM 3 OFFICIAL SCARAB fights/raids.<br>
--b)Not attending 3 scheduled events will result in you having to reapply all over again.  Exceptions DO APPLY! The main one being that we do not schedule 3 raids. If this situation arises it will be taken care of in some fair and just fashion, on an individual basis.<br>
--c)The date from your membership applications acceptance will be the date that your proving period begins.<br>
<br>
2) During the "proving period" you are not a member of SCARAB, but instead are known as an "initiate".<br>
<br>
3) NO INITIATES MAY LOOT.  Please read loot rules as well.<br>
<br>
4) Initiates will gain points per our points system.  Initiates start with negative points, but it is possible (quite possible, actually) to have a good amount of positive points before initiate period is over.  Your points accumulated as an initiate will carry over with you when you become a member.  However, this also applies to initiates who have not yet accumulated enough points to go on the positive scale, thus, negative points will still have to be earned off after membership is granted.<br>
<br>
5) Raiding and/or helping on epic/quest fights will gain you points.  Points will be awarded per our points system (we will come up with a point system for every zone and every mob, which will be altered as needed to keep it as fair and realistic as possible as time goes on).  Points are awarded at the end of a raid/fight, those still around are awarded points, thus it goes without further saying (but I will anyway): dont come to a raid if you are going to leave halfway through, you will gain no points, and you will get a severe 'bad mark' on your name.  Emergencies do arise and if explained (and even better: if supported by others as well) will be taken care of on an individual basis.  In emergency situations you will be awarded at maximum half points for the raid, depending on when you left, why you left, etc...It is all up to the raid leader to decide how many points are awarded.<br>
<br>
6) We will be charging initiates 15p per 1 point that the raid awards.  Members will be charged 10p per 1 point that the raid awards. When claiming loot, 1 points equals roughly 1000pp (1kpp), so your money is returned 100-fold.  You are not allowed to claim money.  No money ever collected for raids will be used by anyone personally, it will be a cash fund to replace costs of reagents, ports (planes, for example), and anything else the group needs.  The SCARAB fund will be made public, and will be updated along with the members list at minimum once a week.  All purchases (down to the last copper piece) will be documented when made with the SCARAB fund.<br>
<br>
7) If an item is dropped on a raid, and all the attending members of SCARAB have insufficient points to be able to claim it, the item will go to the SCARAB bank.  ONLY the members that attended the raid for this item will be able to claim it, but until at minimum 2 (TWO) members of THAT raid have sufficient points to roll (/rand) for the item, it will be held in the SCARAB bank.  These items will not be used, they will be held, end of discussion (do not ask to 'borrow' held items).<br>
<br>
8) There will be a mainlooter at each raid, if anyone is caught looting other then the main looter, he/she will be banned for a minimum of 1 week from all SCARAB raids.  Repeat offenses of this will ban that person from SCARAB raids completely.  Suffice to say, if you ninja an item, you will never ninja an item again from us.<br>
<br>
9) Any arguing whatsoever or fighting about loot will disqualify the parties involved from all points for that raid, it will also disqualify them from all prize claiming from that raid (they will not be able to cash in points in order to roll for an item gained).  Repeat offenses will ban you from SCARAB events for 1 week.  Repeat offenses after being banned will ban you from SCARAB.  Suffice to say, if you care about nothing except shiny metal objects and ph4t l3wt, you do not belong in SCARAB.  Theres the door, hurry up because im going to hit you with it on the way out...<br>
<br>
10) Rules added to this list will be added and given a full week of scrutiny by all members before being 'officially' added.  That, of course, relies 100% on the majority vote of the members on the new rule.  SCARAB will perform everything it does in a completely fair, equal opportunity, "republic" sortof way.  Every member, from the leaders to the lowest lvl members without any points all have an equal say in the development of SCARAB.  Votes will be held regularly for ANY and ALL changes made to the structure of SCARAB.  To make it easy, they will be put in poll form, and only registered members of SCARAB will, of course, be allowed to vote.  At the end of the poll period, the decision of the group will be executed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/umoriminomoto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mori Minomoto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(9/1/02 11:37:54 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Loot rules, ctd.</span><hr size=1> Main looting rules:<br>
1) Each raid will have an ML (main looter).  Only the ML, and if assigned, a backup ML will be allowed to loot.  This includes all coin, research components, everything.  It is a good idea for raid leaders to assign both an ML and a backup ML.<br>
<br>
2) Initiates MAY NOT loot.  They MAY accumulate points to be cashed in at later raids for loot.  Initiates caught looting, or even attempting to cash in points for loot, will be banned from SCARAB.  Mistakes are understandable, and if made, must be corrected immidiately when discovered. (ie: if a raid leader doesnt know that an initiate is only an initiate, and goes ahead and gives him/her a won item.  In this kind of scenario, immidiately after the initiate is contacted by one of the SCARAB leaders, he/she must return the item, and explain the situation.  If he/she fails to do so, it is considered ninja-looting and is an immidiate ban from all SCARAB events, ever.)<br>
<br>
3) All money gained on raids will be added to the SCARAB bank.  All research components will be dealt out to the attending INT casters at the cost of 1 point for ALL research components gained for their class (ie: a wizard can cash in 1 point for ALL runes gained on the raid, including any other misc research items usable by wizard...conflicting class research items - although very few of them exist, if any - will be /random'd between the conflicting parties).<br>
<br>
3) All wizards will be either supplied with or paid back for any porting stones to/from the planes.  Twice the amount of porting stones as needed to get to the planes will be bought before the appropriate raid, in case of wipes, CRs, and pickups.  This money will come directly from the SCARAB fund.<br>
<br>
4) All priest classes will be supplied with or paid back for any and all reagants used during a raid.  All necro's will be supplied with or paid back for any and all reagants used during a raid (coffin's, etc.).  This repayment will come directly from the SCARAB fund.<br>
<br>
5) All loot will be dealt out at the END of each raid.  There will be an end-raid meet point for all SCARAB members which will be designated before the raid (and is in fact quite feasable to just be the pre-raid meet point).  In the scenario that the intended raid is more then a single zone raid (ie: double dragon raid - naggy and voxx), all loot will be dealt out AT THE END of the raid, that is to say, when the entire raid is finished (in this scenario: both dragons are dead, or the raid leader calls it an end).  In the situation of a multi zone raid, when one zone is finished and the raid party is ready to move to the next zone, the ML (main looter) will give all unique dropped items to the RL (raid leader) and all scrub items (research stuff, money, misc junk) to the backup ML.<br>
<br>
6) NO DROP items must obviously be looted by their appropriate owner immidiately.  When a ND (no drop) item is encountered, only the SCARAB members present with sufficient points will be allowed to roll for it (and cash in points for it).  If there is no present SCARAB member with sufficient points for the item, the 2 SCARAB members with highest points will roll for the item.<br>
<br>
7) Cashing in points and rolling for items is only allowable for items that your class can use.  Realistically reasonable judgement is implied.  SCARAB will work primarily as a NBG (need before greed) group.  A few examples: (a)Rangers are not allowed to roll on secondary slot shields (Lodi Shield, however, as an example, is ranger winable due to it also being backslot wearable)...(b)Obvious monk items (lightweight, monk usable, good stats) cannot be rolled on by warriors, paladins, and shadowknights (plate classes), but under most circumstances, will still be chain class winable (rangers/rogues)...(c)Rogues get the daggers, paladins/SKs have first choice on 2 handers, rangers/warriors/rogues have first choice on 1 handers.<br>
<br>
8) An add-on to rule #7.  When you, lets say, as a wizard, are doing a quest that required an item that, lets say, a warrior would use, then you are still allowed to roll on the item as if you were a warrior.  PROVIDING that you, before the raid, and on the raid thread in our forums, explain the quest you are doing, explain the loot needed for the quest, and provide links to any websites that can support your claim.  ("I need RBB for my wizard epic" is not going to cut it...you must prove somehow that you in fact need the item that is droppable in the zone(s) we are raiding for your quest.)  If you do not research before-hand to find out what items are dropped in the zone(s) we are raiding, and/or if you need any of those items for quests, and if you do, do not let the raid know about it in the raid thread here, you will not be allowed to win that/those items if they drop, end of story. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fscarab5467frm2.emailToFriend?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fscarab5467frm2.threadControl?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fscarab5467frm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fscarab5467frm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub10.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="scarab5467frm1">General Discussion<option value="scarab5467frm2">Rules, Guidelines, etc.<option value="scarab5467frm3">Applications for Membership<option value="scarab5467frm4">Raid Announcements<option value="scarab5467frm5">Public Tactics<option value="scarab5467frm6">Quest/Epic Raids, Fights, etc.<option value="scarab5467frm7">Zone Raids<option value="scarab5467frm8">Raid Aftershock<option value="scarab5467frm9">Epic Progress<option value="scarab5467frm10">Screenshots<option value="scarab5467frm11">Raid Suggestions<option value="scarab5467frm12">Raid Tactics & Strategies<option value="scarab5467frm13">Current Members & Points<option value="scarab5467frm17">SCARAB Bank<option value="scarab5467frm14">Processed Applications<option value="scarab5467frm18">Board Administration</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6F6F6F>- </font><a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bscarab5467>SCARAB</a><font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fscarab5467frm2>Rules, Guidelines, etc.</a> <font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/bscarab5467">SCARAB</a><font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.92<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
