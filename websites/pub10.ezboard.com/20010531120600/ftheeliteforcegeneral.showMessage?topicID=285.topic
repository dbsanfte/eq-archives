<br>
However, there is one thing that Xunil, Naroon, and I have discussed that we feel should be addressed.  <br>
<br>
We had a bit of a conflict with another guild last night.  On the fourth floor of tower, there is a rare spawn named Cara that drops the key to the 5th floor plus some really expensive loot as well.  She takes a lot of work and time to make her spawn, and the other guild was working to do this.  The elites stumbled upon her room, and she was up and no one was in the room.  We had not called a camp check prior, assumed that she was not camped, and proceeded to kill her.  While we were fighting, the other guild came in, and one member of that guild was very harsh to us right as he entered  the room.  It was clear that they were running around on the 4th floor, trying to get her to spawn, and we happened to be in the room before they had a chance to get back.<br>
<br>
Now, I am sure that if the other guild came in the room and acted politely, explaining their situation, everything would have turned out all right.  We did not NEED the 5th floor key, as we already had one in each group.  However, the other guild came in and started to use foul and harsh language, which in turn incited many of our guild members into saying just as harsh things.  <br>
<br>
The end result was that I looted the key (there was no loot) after trying to offer it to them (They refused to take it for whatever reason).  The point that we would like to make is twofold.  First, on any dungeon raid, even if we intend to &quot;do&quot; the dungeon as ooposed to camping something, we should always do a camp check before we take a step in so we do not step on other groups' toes.  Second, if some &quot;punk&quot; starts to yell at us and use foul language, the proper response from us should be that of an understanding and &quot;lets work this out like adults&quot; tone.  We should never lash back at them and sink to their level.  If you feel that you must let out your frustration, do so in the confines of your group or guild chat (without foul language of course) as to not cause more conflict.<br>
<br>
It is understandable that people do get upset after being lashed at, however, as Elites, we should always present ourselves as Honorable, Courageous, and Compassionate people.  Tempers will flare, mouths will foam, however, keep it within the guildchat or groupchat, and conflicts with others outside our family should remain at a low.  <br>
<br>
I spoke with the leader of the other guild after the incident, he profusely apologized for the group's behavior, saying of course that it was NOT necessary for them to lash out at us that way.  However, I did apologize for the Elites as well, for we should have been courteous of other people in the zone that may have been camping something also.  True, if it is not engaged, it is open, but this spawn in particular is hard to spawn and requires you to not be in the room at all times.  Lets keep that in mind next time and hopefully we'll have even MORE fun with no conflicts <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Always be courteous and understanding of others and treat them as if they were an Elite also.  We don't want to present ourselves in a manner to which people perceive us as Mean, KSers and Harsh people.  Thank you for reading, if you got this far that is <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Feel free to comment, send me an email or whatever.  Comments on this are appreciated if you have any.  Thanks Elites and See you in Norrath!<br>

I know from experience, however, how hard it is to get Cara to spawn so I could sympathize with the other guild. Even when faced with upset people, we must conduct ourselves in a calm, adult manner in order to quickly resolve the problem.

I can flame all day and it won't change a thing.  I made several errors, neglected to call a camp check.  Honest mistake, had a LOT going on.  This in NO way excuses the other parties behavior.  Also, I did not tell my parties what I was doing... I had no intention of taking the guys key, we didn't need it, but after what he did I WAS going to make him squirm.<br>
We have had Cara taken from us half a dozen times, NOT ONCE, did we walk in screaming obsenities and calling people names.  I do not want to disagree with a guildmate but Cara is simple to have pop, the trick is getting back to her before she is killed.  So you do it again... anyone who's been in the tower as much as we have goes in EXPECTING it.<br>
<br>
Enough said, that's about as &quot;Elite&quot; as I can be on the entire matter.<br>

<br>
Please don't take this wrong all, but I am afraid I have to agree with Wild on this one. Yes, we have a responsibility as Elites to behave in a manner other than what was given to us. Yes, we hold ourselves to a higher standard. <br>
<br>
However,<br>
<br>
Like Wild said, it is easy to get this NPC to pop. THe trick is to get to her BEFORE someone else on that floor DOES. This is common, it happens all the time. This guy that verbally hassled me should have opened up his mouth when we RAN BY him and said something like &quot;/ooc Killin PH for Cara, pls let me grab her&quot;. He didn't. There were 20+ ppl in zone when we were there, I looked. And quite frankly, if someone does not call that, then others WILL consider the spawn open. I equate this to someone going off on me for not even being in zone and yelling obscenities at me if I see the AC in S Ro and kill it. Oh wait, they were timing it. Too bad, it was not called.<br>
<br>
And this guy tells me Eff You and this is acceptable? I never got an apology here, I never got any kind of response from the guild leader. In fact, I never heard squat from anyone anywhere even though all I did was tell him to take the damned key. Did I bitch? Not until now. Did I curse back at him? No. In fact, I told people expressly to NOT respond in kind. Will I help him in the future? I really don't know at this point. I did report him for this. It was unwarranted and a very ugly thing to say to a person. And nobody said crap about it.<br>
<br>
Bottom line in my opinion is....<br>
<br>
The camp was not called, by either party. Mistakes happen. But anyone who goes to this tower and is obviously aware of the trigger requirements has NO business getting pissy at another group if they don't call this ahead of time. And they ESPECIALLY have no business mouthing that kind of obscenity at someone and then expecting that person to not react. Not me. Not ever. Call me that and get exactly the reaction I gave. <br>
<br>
Enough said.<br>

Hurt and offended I remain...</font><P><BR>

However I do want to make one point clear...<br>
<br>
I did NOT direct this post to either of you, and I am sorry if you took it that personally that you would feel hurt or &quot;betrayed&quot;.<br>
<br>
And I never once said that the other guild member(s) had any sort of excuse for how they acted.  Maybe he and the other members did not know much about this zone and about Cara or anything.  However, that is not what the main &quot;issue&quot; is.  the main issue is how we present ourselves as a guild and as &quot;resident's&quot; of Norrath.  <br>
<br>
Just because we might have more &quot;experience&quot; in a certain zone or with a certain pop, does not mean others have the same kind of knowledge or patience.  I am not excusing the other guild's behavior, please UNDERSTAND that.  The ONLY thing I request is that if something like this DOES happen again in the future, that we be the bigger man and act adult.  Just because some other punk has the bad mouth and the audacity to use foul language should not give us the O.K. to do the same.  Now, to make another point clear, NO ONE in the Elites that night used a bad word.  However, HARSH words were exchanged, and Honestly, i feel that that situation could have been avoided entirely, if only we ALL kept on track and been courteous of others in the zone.<br>
<br>
This is not necessarily about who called a camp check, who didn't or any of that.  This is not about how to make Cara pop or how easy it might be.  This is not about what has happened to us in past experiences with KSing or whatnot.  This is about how we present ourselves as a family, how patient we are, and how courteous of others we try to be, whether they deserve it or not.<br>
<br>
So put them on your list of people you refuse to help, that is completely your choice, i am not trying to disuade you from doing that. You have a right to your own opinions and own feelings, and not ONCE have I ever tried to hold any of you from keeping that to yourselves.  ALL I am asking is that we all work together to make our guild a friendly place and to show others what AWESOME people we have in the guild.<br>
<br>
Do we want to present ourselves as the kind of guild that says.. &quot;oh well she/he/it wasn't engaged so your SOL..&quot;   I hope not.  I hope that we are the type of guild that can act mature and work things out on in an adult manner and HELP each other.  REGARDLESS if the other guild deserves that or not, it's OUR duty as Elites to what?.. be Honorable.. be Courageous... be Compassionate people.<br>
<br>
Like i said, this was not directed at anyone in particular.  Wild, this was not a post to point out any mistakes you made.. god knows I have made MANY mistakes myself and I know I will continue to do so unfortunately... Word, this was not a post to flame you or to give the other guild an excuse.  This was just a request to be respectful of other players in the game.  That's IT.  That's ALL I wanted to say, obviously, some people took it personally.  <br>
<br>
*sighs*  I hope that you guys do not feel hurt or offended any longer.  I am trying my best to do all I can for the guild and to make everyone feel as comfortable as possible.  If i worded this post wrong and you feel offended still, send me an email, we'll work it out on the side, so others don't have to &quot;listen&quot; to us &quot;flame&quot; or whatnot.  Believe me, i'm not looking for an argument or anything.  but if you still have issues with this, feel free to contact me, you all know how open I am and how much I love to hear feedback from you all, regardless if it's positive or negative.<br>

<br>
I *believe* the point that Coatie was trying to make was that whether or not the room was really &quot;camped&quot; or whether or not they claimed the camp or even whether or not the other guild was polite to you it is everyones' responsibility as an Elite to respond in a mature and reasonable manner - a manner which reflects the ideals of the guild. Sure there are going to be times when people do not live up to those ideals. I have had many occasions myself where I was ashamed of the way I reacted to something or someone within the game. Her post was a post about conduct of the Elites, not conduct of the other guild. She nor anyone else in The Elite Force has any control or really much say in the way others act within the game. That is up to the respective guild leaders and in some instances, the GMs of Verant. A case could be made in a very mature manner or it could just turn into a slap fight. I know a lot of you guys well enough to know how you would handle it and that's why I consider it a pleasure to know you all.<br>
<br>
The fact is simply this. Just as in real life, the world of norrath is filled with good people, jerks, punks, geeks, clowns and pets. Luckily, just as in the real world, we get to choose many times with whom we associate. There have been many times that I have chosen not to group with someone and it would simply be because I do not approve of their conduct. Does that make me better than them? Not necessarily - it just means our styles are incompatible. To them, cussing and swearing may be a way of life. You may say there is no excuse for their behavior. Well, there is no reason that you have to sit and take it. Unlike Real World we are lucky enough to have /ignore lists in norrath.<br>
<br>
My philosophy is a pretty simple one. Just associate yourself with the people you would be proud to associate yourself with and ignore the ones that make the game unpleasurable. Oh - and remember - it is JUST a game - a game where I get to see my friends on a regular basis.

First, Savvage (sp?) was the only one from his group &quot;going off&quot; on us, and later the guild leader of The Brewing Company apologized profusely for the behavior of this individual, saying it was not indicative of the other members of the guild.  I did a guild status and found that Savvage was not an officer, and that there were officers of that guild in the group.  That group had logged out almost immediately after the incident, and frankly, based on Savvage's behavior, I'm sure the others in the group were just too embarrassed to be online anymore.  (Imagine if the positions were flipped, and we had one of our guild members swearing at another guild for no good reason).<br>

There were two distinct points of view on this issue within the guild, and we felt that a forum should be opened to discuss what happened so hopefully we could all come to an understanding and put this behind us.<br>
<br>
Luckily, our guild leader and their's have talked it over, apologized for the situation getting out of hand, and came to a resolution.  (I would like to point out that Coat did not apologize for the behavior of our guild members, but that we did not take the time to confirm if Cara was camped).  I wouldn't be surprised to see that player warned or kicked out of the guild.  But, just to reiterate my opinion on the matter, the main thing that made me upset about the situation was that we did not work with the other group to resolve the issue.  I had my hands tied in this situation as I was a Tower rookie, and had no idea of the amount of work you need to get Cara to spawn, or how things usually go down.  Since we did have members with us that were knowledgeable of common protocol in the Tower, perhaps you could have helped them out.  They said to us that it took them over an hour to get her to spawn.  If we had responded by saying that we were sorry, that we were just on our way to the next floor and she was up with no one in the room, and that in our experiences, she is fairly easy to get to spawn, and explained how to get her to spawn if they were not aware, I am positive with the open communication channel between us and the more polite officers of the guild in that group, that either Savvage would have apologized for his temper, or the officers would have reprimanded him and apologized for him.<br>

I whole-heartidly, honestly, apologize if the original post sounded like a personal attack against anyone.  I honestly can say that was not the intention at all (Coat and I wrote it together).</font><P><IMG SRC="http://www.3snip.com/eliteforce/images/xunil-sig.gif"><P><i><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/btheeliteforce.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=xunil>Xunil</A> at: 5/2/01 4:54:52 pm</FONT><br></i></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=95%><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT></TD><TD ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ftheeliteforcegeneral.showMessage?topicID=284.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1><< Prev Topic</FONT></A> &nbsp;<A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ftheeliteforcegeneral.showMessage?topicID=283.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Next Topic >></FONT></A> </TD></TR></TABLE><BR><TABLE WIDTH=95% BORDER=0><TR><TD><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ftheeliteforcegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=285.topic&index=7><IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/blueMoon/addReply.jpg border=0></A></TD><TD><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ftheeliteforcegeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=285.topic><IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/images/email.gif BORDER=0 ALT="Email This To a Friend"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Email This To a Friend</FONT><BR><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ftheeliteforcegeneral.threadControl?topicID=285.topic><IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/blueMoon/deleteThread.jpg BORDER=0 ALT="Topic Control Image"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Topic Commands (Moderator only)</FONT><BR><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ftheeliteforcegeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=285.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Subscribe</FONT></A>  <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Click to receive email notification of replies</FONT><BR><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ftheeliteforcegeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=285.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Unsubscribe</FONT></A>  <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</FONT><BR></TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3 ALIGN=CENTER><BR><FORM ACTION=http://pub10.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum METHOD=POST><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Jump to: </FONT><SELECT NAME=forumName><OPTION VALUE=theeliteforcegeneral>General<OPTION VALUE=theeliteforceharryfootyssoapbox>Soap Box<OPTION VALUE=theeliteforceguildmeetings>Guild Meetings<OPTION VALUE=theeliteforceguildofficers>Guild Officers<OPTION VALUE=theeliteforcefrm4>Events: 1-20<OPTION VALUE=theeliteforcefrm5>Events: 21-30<OPTION VALUE=theeliteforcefrm6>Events: 31-40<OPTION VALUE=theeliteforcefrm7>Events: 40+<OPTION VALUE=theeliteforcefrm9>Mastered Trade Skills<OPTION VALUE=theeliteforcefrm10>Strategies & Tactics<OPTION VALUE=theeliteforcefrm11>New Canidates<OPTION VALUE=theeliteforcefrm12>Memory Lane<OPTION VALUE=theeliteforcefrm16>Guild Banker<OPTION VALUE=theeliteforcefrm17>Epic Quests</SELECT><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE=Go></FORM></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><CENTER><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF33>- </FONT><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/btheeliteforce><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>The Elite Force</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF33> - </FONT><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ftheeliteforcegeneral><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>General</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF33> - </FONT><A HREF=http://www.3snip.com/eliteforce><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>The Official Elite Force Webpage!</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF33> - </FONT></B></CENTER><P><BR><CENTER><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.free-irewards.com/cgi-bin/ezboard/games.html?id=ouuIcESe" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/banners/iRewards120x30-08.gif"></a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><IMG SRC="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/serve?bfmid=7279965&siteid=33932331&bfpage=roleplaygames" BORDER="0" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" NOSAVE >
