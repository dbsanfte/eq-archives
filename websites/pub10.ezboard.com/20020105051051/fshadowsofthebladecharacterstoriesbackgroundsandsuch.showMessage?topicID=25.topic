(RP)</span><hr size=1> Xyzax was the first character I had, and while I haven't played him in a while, that might very well change. Here are the stories as posted to the EQ Vault with some minor editing of the OOC comments as I did with Prav.<br>
======================================================<br>
Xyzax felt a strong pride in recent events. First, he had been called forth from the hatchery to join the Swift Tail clan, and then after much hard work had been able to gain the notice of the Legions of Thule. An involuntary shudder passed through him at the thought of the dread lord of fear. Slowly, he slipped back over the past few days as he ran up the ramp on autopilot, his mind drifting back in time as his body jumped off the balcony and ran back to do it again.<br>
<br>
He had been cleaning the waste areas at the hatchery when the summons came. He had just enough time to get cleaned up and gather his few belongings before the time would come for him to leave. As he was putting the last few things into the tattered bag he used as a rucksack, the headmistress came in. She had been like a mother to him ever since that fateful day when the raiders came and took his mother and father off after killing all his siblings.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, am I to understand that you have been called to the Swift Tails?&quot;<br>
<br>
He strained to show an outward ease, while inside he was bursting with pride and excitement as he grunted back, &quot;uh-huh.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I taught you better than that, young one - is that a proper way to show respect?&quot;<br>
<br>
The reprimand yanked him out of his reverie and into the present. &quot;No ma'am - my deepest apologies but my thoughts were elsewhere.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That is no excuse, as I'm sure you will soon learn.&quot;<br>
<br>
He paused as he picked up the family picture and remembered the day he returned from town only to find the carnage at home. The rage and hate inside him grew as he subconsciously fed it to avoid the pain of the loss not dealt with. All of a sudden he screamed in frustration and threw the drawing to the ground shattering the slate it was attached to, and destroying the picture in the process.<br>
<br>
The headmistress was startled by the outburst, but not surprised.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will join the Swift Tails, and grow in strength,&quot; he began as he glared at the shards of slate with a now unrecognizable parchment attached to some of the pieces. &quot;Then I will pay just homage to Thule himself as I destroy any of the soft-skins that dare cross paths with me.&quot;<br>
<br>
The headmistress sighed and said, &quot;Sit child - we must talk.&quot;<br>
<br>
Xyzax sat down, the rage still boiling in his heart. He was smart enough, however, not to disrespect her by ignoring the request.<br>
<br>
&quot;I had hoped to have more time before I had this talk with you, but then, things do not always go the way we would like.&quot; She then began to relate a tale that shook his whole understanding of things, and left him numb with questions he was terrified to put into words…<br>
<br>
*ooc* Ok, this is the first story writing I've done in more years than I'd care to admit to, and probably has a number of errors as relates to game mechanics. *shrug* Such is life. Any constructive criticism is welcome, as are any suggestions. Flames will be routed to /dev/null. As for when the next part will come, that all depends on 1, if there is any interest, and 2 on when I figure out just what the story the headmistress relayed was. *laugh* I do have a rough idea, but I usually make characters with the barest of frameworks, and then enjoy watching them develop into creations of their own in effect via RP. Anyhow, it's time to get back to work - hope this was enjoyed by some as much as I actually enjoyed putting the proverbial pen to paper.<br>

<br>
&quot;Xyzax, what do you know of the death of your family?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know that it was the soft skins who did this. I admit I do not know how, since they are no more than slave material, but all I have eversought out returns to this statement.<br>
<br>
&quot;Child, not all soft skins are like the frogloks you see about this city.&quot;<br>
<br>
Xyzax was confused. Not all like the frogloks? What other kind of soft skin could there be? The headmistress saw his confusion, and tried to explain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Child, you know of the oceans far off? Well, across those oceans there are lands where no Iksars have tred in ages. The leaders say that it is because of this that the soft skins in these lands have flourished. Some even say that our Dread Lord has taken some on as followers when we became too at ease as his chosen ones - to put more of a fear that we could be replaced into our hearts.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Replaced? But we are the chosen ones of Cazic Thule! Why would we be replaced?&quot;<br>
<br>
The headmistress raised an eyebrow and said, &quot;You question the dread ones motives enough to call his full name?&quot;<br>
<br>
Xyzax's heart began to race as he realized the folly of his actions - questioning his god's actions and using his full name in the process? What was wrong with him?<br>
<br>
The headmistress saw the turmoil in his eyes, and looked at him with a calming look so as to reassure him. &quot;Do not worry young one - if there were to be repercussions, they would have come already. You are safe for now.&quot;<br>
<br>
His heart slowed slightly as he realized the truth in her words, but he was still somewhat on edge - after all, one can never tell when or how a god of fear might strike.<br>
<br>
&quot;In any event, it was these soft skins who killed your family - or at least it was thought so.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thought so? What do you mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, your father's leather tunic was found, as was his staff - but none of the bodies were. I must tell you something now, a part of why it was you were sent here rather than one of the other hatcheries in the city or elsewhere. You see, your mother was a broodmate of mine. She and I were from the same collection of eggs in fact. And so, I asked to have you sent here under my protection while I quietly researched the truth of that day.&quot;<br>
<br>
Xyzax felt his world beginning to shift on it's very axis - soft skins other than the likes of frogloks? No bodies of his family found? Then why were no parties sent out to get them? Why were they left in the wilds? Then there was the headmistress - or rather his mother's broodmate. For thule's sake, his mother's hatchmate in fact. What did she mean protection? Or by research?<br>
<br>
Headmistress Ishkabibble watched as the questions passed through Xyzax's mind. She sat quiet letting it all sink in, and then said, &quot;Now, there is more I must tell you on this matter - and I must tell you before you go, for once you have gone, you will not be able to return for quite some time.&quot;<br>
<br>

Now, on to part 3...<br>
=========================================================<br>
Xyzax let Her words sink in through the haze that was forming.<br>
<br>
&quot;You see, the Haggle Baron and some others within the city of Cabilis didn't want me to tell you this, but you have a right to know.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked around somewhat nervously now and got up from her seat. She then went over and seemed to secure the door and the windows so that the only light in the room was so dim as to make it hard for him to make things out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Did you say something?&quot; He asked her, his voice seeming to boom in the confined room. She shook her head no as she came back, but he could have sworn he heard her mumbling something - in fact, it looked as if her lips were moving now. She sat back down and spoke again, this time lowering her voice until Xyzax could barely make out what she was saying. He felt a chill creep along his skin as he suddenly felt as if there were several pairs of eyes watching from the shadows.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was told not to tell you what I have found, it was believed by certain people in power that you might act too hastily, before the time was right.&quot; She stopped suddenly and looked towards the shuttered window as if she had heard a sound - Xyzax didn't hear anything, but then his hearing was never as acute as hers. It was a good 5 minutes before she moved, let alone spoke again. One time he started to say something, but she shushed him before he could utter a sound. After about 3-4 minutes, Xyzax could make out what sounded like low breathing just outside the first floor window. After a minute or so, the breathing seemed to fade away, as if someone had moved on. Headmistress Ishkabibble waited a few more minutes to be sure before she continued.<br>
<br>
&quot;We may not have much time child, know that your family was not killed - at least not at that time. They were taken captive to be examined by spell casters the likes of which we have not seen in these lands for ages. To the best of my knowledge, there was some collaboration by certain beings in power here in our lands. I know one was the Haggle Baron himself for the coins he was paid - I am not sure who else, but most likely at least a warlord or perhaps even Grandmaster Glox. For obvious reasons, I have not shared this with anyone else before, but things have come about to make me think we will not be allowed to see one another for a long time to come, and I wanted to be sure you knew the truth.&quot;<br>
<br>
Xyzax was in a state of shock. His family alive? Captured by soft skins? Soft skins were worth no more than a slave, how could they capture one of his kind? Of course, the only way would have been by an act of betrayal. It all made a sickening sense. The haggle baron behind it? He ran all the markets in town - nobody sold a thing without his approval. Or bought a thing for that matter since he could tell the Kloks not to sell to you. Yet more behind it as well? Why? Why would they do this?<br>
<br>
One last part to come...I think...*duck*<br>

Now, on to part 4...the conclusion (for now &gt;;-D)<br>
=========================================================<br>
&quot;There is one more thing,&quot; she said. &quot;Sslaxar brought this to my attention upon his return earlier this afternoon. I learned some information on the soft skin slime that raided your family's home on the outskirts of town. It was a cleric of a god by the name of Tunare.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Klareik? Toonair? Who?&quot; He asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cleric and Tunare, child,&quot; she corrected him. &quot;A cleric is something like a shaman, only weaker and more inept as they are far more strongly tied into their god or goddess. This Tunare is one of the many gods and goddesses these soft skins follow. Realize how confused and weak they are in that they need all these different gods, while we as a race are able to stay true to the one god who should be feared among all others. She is called the Gate Mother or some such from what my sources say, I suppose she is a goddess of metals or some such. In any event, I also learned he is what the soft skins call a High Elf, which is just another race of the soft skins that I spoke of earlier.&quot;<br>
<br>
She stopped at this point and seemed very nervous and tense. She paused listening to the wind and rain that had just renewed its downpour.<br>
<br>
Her voice became softer still as she said, &quot;His name is Thalanar, and he is a member of a guild of some minor strength who call themselves the Silver Shadows. Know this - my sources tell me that he and some of his fellow guild members hunt in these lands still, so be wary of where you step.&quot;<br>
<br>
Headmistress Ishkabibble was right, he did feel his whole world shaking to its very core. Gate Mother, hmm? She must be a very evil goddess indeed to have let her Klerk (was that it…no, it didn't sound quite right) commit such atrocities. He in turn must be even more vile - a creature to be as detested as the excrement pits he had recently been working in.<br>
<br>
&quot;You must go now,&quot; she said. &quot;It is almost first light, and that is the usual time Grandmaster Glox sees new students.&quot;<br>
<br>
Xyzax packed his belongings and prepared to leave. He was in a daze as he bowed in respect and headed out the door. Could he trust anyone with this? Of course not, from what she said, if any of those involved found out what he knew, he would be dead. He had to watch his words, be careful of what he said and to whom. He also had to grow as fast as he could and shed his skins as quickly as possible. Only then could he hope to take revenge on this Thailanair. No, that wasn't the name…Thalanar, yes, that was it. He would never forget that name again. He continued down the path and suddenly remembered he had forgotten the picture. He may have broken it in his frustration, but it was still the only true remnant he had of his family. He was a good 15 minutes away from the hatchery, if he hurried he could make it back and still be able to be at the House of Pain on time.<br>
<br>
**********************************************<br>
<br>
She watched as Xyzax headed down the road and shut the door. Then she felt His presence, and immediately dropped to a prone position.<br>
<br>
&quot;You did as our Lord instructed?&quot; The Messenger asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I told him what I was supposed to, and it should be working. He was terrified at times, and will be for some time to come.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good.&quot; The Messenger grinned with such evil as to freeze the very marrow in her bones. She didn't notice however, as she was still prone in a supplicant position. &quot;Well he should,&quot; the Messenger continued. &quot;Our Master has plans and has made certain agreements and arrangements. This child should make good fodder for the planned events. You have done well and pleased the Master. I have been told you have earned your reward.&quot;<br>
<br>
She felt pride at the praise.<br>
<br>
&quot;There is one last thing to be handled before I can give you the deadly secrets promised to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Headmistress Ishkabibble could hardly wait. She had studied the dark arts for many years, rising throught the circles of necromancy. Now she was going to be granted that lost knowledge she had been hunting for 10 years now. She was so caught up in the dreams of the fear that she would put into the hearts of others that she never saw the blow coming.<br>
<br>
**********************************************<br>
<br>
Xyzax walked into the hatchery and ran up to his room…no, his old room now…to get the picture. He bent down to pick up the pieces of the picture, and that was when he saw it. There, on the floor were the remains of Headmistress Ishkabibble. At least he thought it was her from the scrap of cloth on the limb by his hand. He decided he needed to get away as quick as possible, and turned to head out. That was when he saw the writing. The dampness and dark coloring meant one thing. It could only have been written in her blood, especially given the shape of the room. The words said, &quot;Such is the fate of those who ask too many questions. Especially when they concern Tunare or her beloved cleric, Thalanar.&quot; Xyzax realized that whomever did this might still be about, and he had best be elsewhere. Another day, his time would come. He hurried out into the street and made it to the House of Pain with minutes to spare.<br>
<br>
**********************************************<br>
<br>
The Messenger stepped from the shadows with a sadistic grin. It had almost been too easy to fool the old crone into thinking he was a messenger from her god. She did all that he wanted and more. And this young lizard - he would fit into the plans quite well, even though he didn't realize it yet. All that had to be done now was wait and Thalanar would have a big scaly surprise headed his way soon enough. It wouldn't even matter if the lizard found out the whole truth because by then it would be too late. The Master would have another in his debt, and the Messenger would be one step closer to his own freedom. Yes, the Master would be quite pleased with what he had done here in the remote lands of Kunark. He nodded and smiled in satisfaction at that thought and slipped out into the night to return to his true Master and render his report.<br>
<br>
**********************************************<br>
<br>
Thus began the adulthood of Xyzax, Member of the Swift Tail clan and proud member of the Legions of Thule. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/fshadowsofthebladecharacterstoriesbackgroundsandsuch.showMessage?topicID=27.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/fshadowsofthebladecharacterstoriesbackgroundsandsuch.showMessage?topicID=24.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fshadowsofthebladecharacterstoriesbackgroundsandsuch.emailToFriend?topicID=25.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fshadowsofthebladecharacterstoriesbackgroundsandsuch.threadControl?topicID=25.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fshadowsofthebladecharacterstoriesbackgroundsandsuch.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=25.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fshadowsofthebladecharacterstoriesbackgroundsandsuch.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=25.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub10.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="shadowsofthebladefrm3">General Discussion<option value="shadowsofthebladefrm4">The Yard Sale<option value="shadowsofthebladefrm29">Trade Skills and Sales of Trade Skill Items<option value="shadowsofthebladefrm27">Quest Help and <option value="shadowsofthebladefrm5">Rants, Raves and Assorted Flames<option value="shadowsofthebladefrm6">Out of Character/Norrath Discussions<option value="shadowsofthebladefrm31">Guild Wars<option value="shadowsofthebladefrm33">Indie-Raids<option value="shadowsofthebladeroleplaying">Role Playing<option value="shadowsofthebladecharacterjournals">Character Journals<option value="shadowsofthebladefrm21">Jesters Corner<option value="shadowsofthebladecharacterstoriesbackgroundsandsuch">Character Stories (Backgrounds and Such)<option value="shadowsofthebladefrm17">Kings and Queens of Melee - Rogues, Monks and Warriors<option value="shadowsofthebladefrm20">Hybrids - Rangers Paladins Shadow Knights and Bards<option value="shadowsofthebladefrm19">Healers - Clerics Shamans and Druids<option value="shadowsofthebladefrm18">Casters - Mages Necros Wizzies and Chanters<option value="shadowsofthebladefrm32">Admin and Moderators only<option value="shadowsofthebladefrm35">Roku's Colouring Book<option value="shadowsofthebladefrm36">Neverwinter Nights<option value="shadowsofthebladefrm37">Star Wars</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#939393>- </font><a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bshadowsoftheblade>House W'Rath</a><font color=#939393> - </font><a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fshadowsofthebladecharacterstoriesbackgroundsandsuch>Character Stories (Backgrounds and Such)</a> <font color=#939393> - </font><a href="http://members.home.net/sbugelli">House W'Rath Common Hall</a><font color=#939393> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
