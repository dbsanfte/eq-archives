When I pick up a mission, I simply can't refrain myself, I must put the slider way up to the right. And it's pretty silly believe me. I keep getting killed and I lose all my Xps. Sometimes I succeed, and I'm slowly moving up. On the other hand, I'm having a great time and I like to believe that I'm getting a good tactical experience.<br>
<br>
One of my &quot;I believe this is a good trick&quot; is to run &quot;first aid expertise&quot; program. It allows me to use a higher grade of first aid injections. By the way, this thing should be illegal. It's highly addictive: I always need a bigger and stronger dosage! Sometimes, I even use 2 doses in the same fight!<br>
<br>
At the begging, I had lots of computer crashing; something like one every hour. Since it seemed to be much more than what others were getting, I started to look in my system for any problems. I think I found an easy solution. I run my desktop at 1024x768x16, the game also with the same settings and I choose to run it in a window. Results; no crash in 6 hours so far. (I cross my fingers so that it will stay this way)<br>
<br>
I think I understand now the nature of those different armors.<br>
They are sorted by breed and not by profession. (I wonder If some is laughing, thinking that I was pretty slow on this one)<br>
Sence and agility are for Opifex<br>
Intelligence and psychic are for Nanos<br>
Stengh and stamina are for Atrox<br>
The rest would be for those ordinary humans.... (solitus)<br>
<br>
Agent Chronicle<br>
<br>
Picking up my profession was pretty much like a wild guess, lets say an intuition. I am very happy to have chosen an agent, its exactly to kind of role I like to &quot;pretend to be&quot;.<br>
<br>
But is it powerful? Not for now, thats for sure. Only 1 special attack (aimed shot) and at my level, it doen't give me much benefit (maybe 1 free shot ones in a while) No great specific nano programs but.... the possibility, for a short periode of time, to borrow all the other professions specific programs. And this seems to me like lots of hours of fun!<br>
<br>
I now can &quot;transform&quot; myself into an enforcer or a soldier. (unfortunately with a 25 pts penalty to my nanos, but nothing is perfect)<br>
<br>
Now, I would ask you all to brag about your profession. What is your best program; the one you wouldn't go in combat without? <p>Noche: Could you repeat this slowly for me please?</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6B8E23><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/uceleroy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Celeroy</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(9/1/01 2:19:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=649.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: game's first impresions</span><hr size=1> Since the MA tweak, I'm back to my first character too, old Roy.<br>

At lvl 31, he's a first class tank, second class Doctor and a first rate fighter.<br>
<br>
I would never go into battle without a couple things:<br>
<br>
My first preference &quot;can't do without&quot; things are Toecutter, Zerin and Krystl, but since this isn't always possible...<br>
<br>
Brawl skill maxed out--don't underestimate this skill if you can use it. With a 216 skill, I usually hit for 80-100 on the new quicker recycle rate (about 9 seconds?) but I frequently hit for 130 or so with a nice crit once in a while in the 330 range. Makes the battle a lot shorter.<br>
<br>
Healing nano's--MA's are reputed to be the next best thing to a Doc, not as good by a long ways, but good enough to save someone while fighting. Right now I am carrying an all team heal that returns up to 166 hp's for everyone at the same time and a singular heal that returns up to 200. I'll be able to upgrade next level.<br>
<br>
Celeroy was weak and puny compared to Zerin, Toe and Mottle so I had put him in moth balls, but the MA tweak has equalled the pack and I love the moves, hehe. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ugharadin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gharadin</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(9/1/01 3:28:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=649.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: game's first impresions</span><hr size=1> Hehehe, when I saw that Noche always sets the mission difficulty all the way to the right, all I could think of was &quot;Different world, different name, but that's our old friend Dia!&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I really enjoy playing a soldier, but it does get a little frustrating sometimes. I'll never be able to do as much damage over time as an enforcer or MA. I can't tank like an enforcer, or heal like an MA. A lot of times when I'm fighting alongside Zerin or Roy, plinking away with my E-Beamer and feeling totally useless, I start to wonder whatever made me decide to become a soldier.<br>
<br>
But then I take out my big, slow IEC Flashpoint laser rifle, fire off a quick 500 point burst and 1000 full-auto, and it all comes back to me! No one can do as much damage in a short time as a soldier. A soldier really shines when a fight goes bad, like when you have 3 dark oranges pounding on you at the entrance, and need to get rid of one fast.<br>
<br>
Since the Mirror Shield nerf, our line of nanos is really pretty lame, at least at lower levels. I expect they'll do some tweaking eventually, but for now I doubt I'll be putting any more IPs into nanos. The most useful are actually the general buffs, especially Assault Rifle, Ranged Energy, and Full-Auto. There definitely appears to be a damage bonus based on your weapon skill, so besides hitting more often, these seem to add a few points of damage as well. I'm definitely going to follow Noche's advice and get the First Aid buff pronto!<br>
<br>
One other thing that's amazingly useful is implants! I think these are the key to being able to fight above your level. With a set of QL 30 implants, I was able to equip a QL 50 E-Beamer around level 35, without any other buffs. I'm working on finishing off the set now, which will let me use much better armor as well. It's expensive, and a huge pain to find all the clusters you need, but it's worth it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6B8E23><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bforgottentruthforeignlegion.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=noche>Noche</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ireseau.com/usagers/jfn/Dia.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(9/1/01 3:54:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=649.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: game's first impresions</span><hr size=1> poops!

More I think about it, more I'm getting to think my strategie is wrong. Going only for sence-agility based armor is too restrictive. I cant find these kind of armor fast enough for my leveling. Plus, I'm getting unbalanced protection; not enough energie protection. Plus, I can't benefit of what friends can give me. So, I will put Ips in strenght after all and will be able to use 2 kinds of armor; sence-agility and stenght-agility.<br>

That can save you a few IP's by allowing you to equip various armors or equipment a bit early. Once you have the item equiped, you can let the buffs drop. DummDumm did this for a few levels in order to use his &quot;essence&quot; and first aid nano buffs. I had to buff my psy-mod and one other skill before I could use next set of buffs...<br>
<br>
I think Toe must be confused about who is doing damage. Enforcers are not knows for their ability to do damage, but we can take a punch or two. DummDumm can do some serious damage when he gets lucky. He broke the 400 mark with his hammer this morning. But I tend to follow up those big hits with smaller numbers... Like... 9... yes... NINE. &lt;sighs&gt;. At 10 seconds per hit, that can be a bad thing.<br>
<br>
Enforcer Nano's to use... Hmmm. I would suggest the highest of the &quot;essence&quot; line. This is a decent HP buff that lasts a fairly long time. I don't know if you can go into combat in your false profession, but if you can, then I would very highely suggest that you pick up &quot;mongo slam&quot;. This is the bread and butter nano for solo'ing enforcers and I can't say enough how much of a difference it makes! Just don't use it in town! It agro's everything around you and those guards have no sense of humor... The agro part of it is fairly weak, but the 333pt health buff and heal is kind of nice... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  You can pop this off just before you go into combat (in a safe room) and then use it again several times during a fight. It does not lock any skills, so your only limitation is your nano pool. Zerin could use this about 4 times at level 37, giving him a &quot;virtual&quot; 2400 points of health.<br>

<br>
Noche, you might want to think twice about putting points into strength just to use armor. At lower levels it's fine, but you'd have to keep doing it to keep your armor upgraded, and that's a lot of IP's to spend! Toe has wasted a lot of IP's, and at 39 I'm starting to really feel it. It seems like mobs are starting to get critical hits on me a lot more; I'll be getting hit for 30-40 and all of a sudden they'll hit for 90. I've heard that defensive skills like dodge and evade help avoid criticals, but after ignoring them for a long time, I'm having trouble coming up with enough IP's to raise them. After putting points in all my critical skills like Assault Rifle, there's not a lot extra to go around.<br>
<br>
I know it's tough finding armor in missions, but one option might be to spend a little time in town listening to the shopping channel (it's another chat option on the Friends window, but it's only available in towns). I've bought a lot of armor from other players pretty cheaply. Eventually you'll also be able to buy armor from stores, but there doesn't seem to be much selection below QL 30 or so.<br>
<br>
Even though they nerfed the soldier's Mirror Shield line of nanos, it's probably a worthwhile one to know. They all block 75% of all damage you take for a short time (the lowest lasts 20 seconds). It used to be all that damage was reflected back to the attacker, but now it's a much smaller amount. Still, only taking 25% of your normal damage for a few rounds can mean the difference in a close fight, and it can be a lifesaver if you get jumped by something nasty while you're running to a mission... that 20 seconds is usually enough time to get away. The downside is you can't start any other nano programs for 2 minutes after you use it, and it won't run if you have a better reflection shield running. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bforgottentruthforeignlegion.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=noche>Noche</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ireseau.com/usagers/jfn/Dia.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(9/4/01 10:38:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=649.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: game's first impresions</span><hr size=1> Thanks for those great infos!

Such as Obtru steel ribbed may have more AC per QL than MA armor, but are the requirements higher per QL as well?  I have noticed that the requirements for steel-ribbed per QL is a little bit higher than MA armor per lvl.  Guess it would be a case by case decision. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=649.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=649.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=649.topic&index=14><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=649.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.threadControl?topicID=649.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=649.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=649.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub10.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="forgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral">General<option value="forgottentruthforeignlegionlinks">Links<option value="forgottentruthforeignlegionmembers">Members<option value="forgottentruthforeignlegionquotes">Quotes<option value="forgottentruthforeignlegionfrm4">Uber Loot<option value="forgottentruthforeignlegionfrm5">AO Guild Notes<option value="forgottentruthforeignlegionfrm6">The Shop At Home Forum!</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#5F9EA0>- </font><a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bforgottentruthforeignlegion>Forgotten Truth Foreign Legion</a><font color=#5F9EA0> - </font><a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral>General</a> <font color=#5F9EA0> - </font><a href="http://www.forgottentruth.com">Home</a><font color=#5F9EA0> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
