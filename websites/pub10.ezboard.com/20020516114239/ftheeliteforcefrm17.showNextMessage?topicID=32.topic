<br>
Beastlord Citizen Quest:<br>
(This is the first quest you will receive as a Beastlord know for all you that are new to this zone it can be confusing at times so I am going to try to use the map in the game manual you got with SOL to try to get you as close as I can to NPC and I will have there names soon!)<br>
<br>
The first part of this quest involves going to a lady very close the the place marked 1 in the booklet she is call the Registor she is the bases for the hole quest so don't forget how to get to her. She is in a little hut like complex.  (The easiest way I have found is there are two vendors just as you enter the gate the black one to your left is the one that is important she stands close to a corner wall of the building in back of them just go around that corner and head strait back to the door.) Know after you find her and give here the note you received from you guild master. She will send you on a quest for two items. The Tax collector is at the Bank! (for anyone who does not know where that is see the arena #7 in the booklet well if you look to your left and down a little there is a small grouping of houses it is the farthest one down) He is in back of the bankers so you need to open the door and go in. give him the note you recieved from the registor and he will give a note back with his seal on it. Now the second item the registor asks for is a slate know here is where it got tough for me she said the name of the person was Gahrag or something like that. He is also located over by #6 on the map he is in the block looking house by the gate on the second floor well in order to get it from him you must say &quot;may I have a acrilic slate&quot;. Then after you have those 2 items return to the registor and hand them both too her. She will then send you with a letter to go find the King Raja he is located in the palace or #3 on the map you will find him just inside the main door and across the hall. Give the letter to him and he will give you one back. Once again return to the registor with this new letter and hand it to her. She will then send you to your guild master with the slate and note hand them both to him. He will then give you your slate and a cloak as a reward. (also look at how much EXP ya got from doing all this). He then says to go talk to his apprentice this is the guy thats stand alone off to the right. <br>
<br>
Second Part: Handwraps<br>
Give him your slate and he will give you a tailoring bag and a patern for handwraps. Now in order to make handwraps here is what you must do and the formula to make the items.<br>
In order to make them you need to kill Xatra Worms (are found in the pit basicly the area under the big bridges coming out of the city to get down there safely go to the other side across the bridge from the city and slide down the hill yes it is the only way down and up) or Xatra Silkenworms (I like silkens cus more drops of silk but higher lvl) (found in hollowshade thicket)<br>
They drops silk called Shadowed silk now here is the formula<br>
2 shadowsilk=1 thread 2 thread=1 bandage in order to make it you skill will have to increase and should be around 20's when done. To make the handwraps place 3 bandages unstacked in the sewing bag and your patern. YES you can fail! NO you will not loose the Pattern. Once you get a successful combine! WALA HANDWRAPS 2ac all tho worth it at low lvls and to get EPIC later Take the extra materal to the apprentice in your guild the same one as before and he will give you the next quest!<br>
<br>
Next Quest: Claws<br>
After you have give your extra materal to the apprentice he will say to find 2 hoper claw (collect as many as you can) drops off rockhoppers in the pit then he will also ask for forged fasterns to get these you must talk to a guy in the city (will have name soon) on the map he is located just to the right of the arena #7 he is in the complex of building you will find him outside one by a kiln and furnaces. Say to him &quot;may I have some fasterns&quot; he will give you a box and ask you to collect scorpion legs fairly rare no drop items of the scorpions in the pit. Collect 4 combine and bring it back ( I personly collect as many as I can) he will give you your forged fasterns. Now here is why I said collect as many as you can. To make the claw you put the 2 hopper claws in the sewing kit and the forged fasterns and you handwraps. YES you can fail at this and if you do you have to back out and collect up more! The only thing you will not lose if you fail is you handwraps. Wooo Thx you EQ LOL once combined bring your claws to the apprentice and turn them and your cloak in to get your next quest.<br>
<br>
Next Quest : ( This is as far as I have gotten so I will post more as it happens. Also will add NPC names as I find them out) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/btheeliteforce.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=devincean>Devincean</A> at: 12/12/01 6:13:42 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#255E8B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ukarnettee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karnettee</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.takish-hiz.com/thekarns.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Co-Leader/Secretary</span><br>  Posts: 155<br> <font color=#3299CC>(12/13/01 7:27:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ftheeliteforcefrm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=30.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Beastlord Quests</span><hr size=1> I am tickled that you have the desire to provide us with this questing information.  <br>
<br>
This information you have provided regarding the Beastlord quests is perfect.  I thought I might  be on the wrong track turning in my claws, fasteners and wraps...because I've had 3 failures.  How frustrating...when I spend 3 hours running after those little hoppers and eventually get the 2 required to combine.....only to fail once again.<br>
My tailoring skill is maxed for my level..so maybe tonite I'll be fortunate enough to have success.  One thing about it..I'm still getting experience as I collect those items needed.<br>
<br>
Thanks once again Dev....keep up the good research in providing this very beneficial information to us.<br>
