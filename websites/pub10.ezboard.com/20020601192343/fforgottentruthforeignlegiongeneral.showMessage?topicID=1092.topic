======================================= <br>
<br>
Dark Age of Camelot <br>
<br>
Test Version 1.50C Release Notes <br>
<br>
April 30, 2002 <br>
<br>
======================================= <br>
<br>
<br>
NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES <br>
<br>
- The Shaman level 50 armor has been replaced with a more suitable graphic. <br>
<br>
- Enemy players should now longer be able to take control of siege equipment through a door. <br>
<br>
- If you're in combat mode and you sit down, you'll now exit out of combat mode. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> - Heals will now &quot;heal&quot; mez, even when the person being healed is at full health.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
- Really large experience awards should no longer print as negative numbers (even though the proper amount of experience as being awarded). <br>
<br>
- High-level poisons are now stripped from a weapon that is used by a lower level player. Previously the poison would not &quot;fire&quot;, and the poison would stay on the weapon indefinitely. <br>
<br>
- Chat groups will now support up to 50 players. <br>
<br>
- [/gc who alliance] will now show you everyone in the alliance, not just players in your guild. <br>
<br>
- Keep Lords and Guards will no longer warp to the roofs of keeps when fighting enemies. <br>
<br>
- You can no longer use charged items directly out of your inventory. <br>
<br>
- You can no longer &quot;pull&quot; players via resurrection behind boundary walls or other illegal locations. <br>
<br>
- Pets will no longer attack mesmerized enemies if the pet is in defensive mode. If he is set to aggressive, he will still attack mezzed enemies. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
REALM ABILITIES NOTES <br>
<br>
- A bug was fixed that was causing a number of active realm abilities to be mismatched and perform incorrect functions or no function at all. <br>
<br>
- Mastery of Stealth now has 3 levels and each level adds 5% movement speed while stealthed. <br>
<br>
- Augmented Stats not showing up and Mastery of Water not boosting swim speed are known issues and will be fixed shortly. <br>
<br>
- Wild Arcana's description reads: &quot;A percent to critical for up to double effect with duration-based magic.&quot; This should read: &quot;A percent to critical for up to double effect for damage-over-time, stat debuffs, resistance debuffs, snares and disease spells.&quot; Mesmerize, stun and root spells are not affected. <br>
<br>
- Mastery of the Arcane's description reads: &quot;Additional effectiveness of duration-based spells.&quot; This should read: &quot;A percent bonus to the values of buff spells, including stat, regeneration, resistance, damage add/shield, haste, and absorption spells.&quot; <br>
<br>
- The Rain line of realm abilities have had their base damage reduced, and add 2 dps per level in the ability. In general these types of abilities add 5% per level for the duration. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> - Purge and Group Purge work while mesmerized now.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
- Siege Bolt should be doing much more damage. We will still look at whether or not the new damage is where it needs to be, given the reuse timer and other factors. <br>
<br>
- The Juggernaut pet is faster, bigger, and actually named something now. It was erroneously being summoned at L50 no matter what the level of the caster was, however; this has been corrected. It is supposed to be a 100% pet. <br>
<br>
- Made a change to skill checks that may affect a few spells that were checking &quot;skill 0&quot; to improve the offensive skill associated with the spell. This should increase their effectiveness. Volcanic Pillar is one example. <br>
<br>
- Volcanic Pillar has been changed to a direct damage spell, instead of a bolt. The damage of the spell wasn't changed. <br>
<br>
AUDIO NOTES <br>
<br>
This version of Camelot has the first version of our new ambient sound system. You'll notice while running around that you won't hear so much dead silence. This version is just the first step in the changes, though - so all you'll hear are non-interactive sounds such as birds, animals, wind, etc. All zones have had this sound upgrade, which includes both new day and night sounds. <br>
<br>
Pendragon testers need to give us feedback on how intrusive the sounds are: if they are too loud/too soft, the right sounds for the area, you hear streams when you are near them, you don't hear streams where there is no water, etc. <br>
<br>
<br>
WORLD NOTES <br>
<br>
Trade Skills: all craft trainers will now give additional information to players just prior to joining a crafting guild. Information details what the player will be creating and how well the player can craft within the other crafting skills. <br>
<br>
Midgard Quests: We have added two repeatable quests, similar to the Soul Gem and Fell Tooth Albion-based quests. These Midgard quests begin in Uppland, and there is a limit to the maximum number of times you can complete them. <br>
<br>
Albion Quests: Remember, in our next patch, we will be adding a limit to the maximum number of times you can complete the following quests: &quot;Soul Gem&quot; and &quot;Fell Tooth Bounty.&quot; If you want to guarantee that you can turn in any items you might have been saving for these quests, you should turn them in before the next patch. <br>
<br>
Hibernia Quests: We have added two repeatable quests, similar to the Soul Gem and Fell Tooth Albion-based quests. These Hibernian quests begin in or near Mt. Collory, and there is a limit to the maximum number of times you can complete them. <br>
<br>
Hibernia Monster Encounters: Hibernia, Cliffs of Moher: The Koalinth Sentinels guarding Koalinth Caverns taken new sentry posts away from the exit of the dungeon. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
OBJECT NOTES <br>
<br>
- Several common loot objects are now stackable that previously weren't. This includes necklaces, collars, chains, bracelets, bracers, armbands, bottles, different kinds of dust, essences, pins, and a few other assorted small items. <br>
<br>
- Salvage values based on the value of the object have been set on existing dropped armor and weapons. <br>
<br>
- Removed &quot;phantom proc&quot; from the Worn Dark Guardian Sword. <br>
<br>
- The stat bonuses on the Granny's Shawl were tuned to be more level appropriate. <br>
<br>
- Salvage values based on the value of the object has been set on existing <br>
quest armor and weapons. <br>
<br>
- The Cloak of Night can now take emblems. <br>
<br>
- The Emerald-beaded strand now has the correct icon. <br>
<br>
- The level 50 Infiltrator, and Friar quest armor should now show properly. Previously they had missing graphics. <br>

As for respeccing OUR sorcerors.....do not make a rush to judgement.  Mez and Stun will still work against NPC's, which is extremely helpful in xp groups.  Stun and Mez should still be helpful vs Keep defenders.  They should also help nail those pesky little stealthers that stray too far from home.<br>
Another thought is; if their healers are kept busy &quot;healing&quot; their players, perhaps they will be too busy to cast their own Stuns and Mezzes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/uranbas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ranbas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(5/1/02 8:34:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1092.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: reply</span><hr size=1> Last few nights in rvr something weird happened, all the clerics were mezzed.  So it will not be that big of issue, people will just need to learn to not break the healers mez until the end of the fight.  I love this idea, think it will allow for longer fights becuase people will have to work together more and assist.  Here is a question.<br>
<br>
Can you heal other people with the potions you can buy with your Bounty Points?  If so this patch will give a reason for having them now.<br>

They're mobs.<br>
<br>
Anything that takes a player's control away in the game is a BAD thing. Anything that gives one group what amounts to an overwhelming advantage every time is a BAD thing. It doesn't take any skill at all to AE mez a group and everyone knows this. The only time ANYONE likes this is when they get to do it to someone else. Then it's FUN, but any other time it sucks. This in itself is indicative of a problem. Hell, keep single target mez as is, but then again it takes skill to target the biggest potential problem character in an opposing group and mez him rather than just pressing the WIN button we know as AE mez.<br>
<br>
As mez stands now it's a death sentence for the most part. I don't think anyone (except Wizards and Runemasters) would advocate Wizards and Runemasters getting a targetable instacast AE DD spell that does about 1000 rps to any enemy in the radius, yet in many cases that's exactly what mez does.<br>
<br>
The cries from the mezzers are loud right now, mostly consisting of &quot;Oh great, with mez having a counter now the group with the most people will tend to win&quot;. I mean, a statement like that oughta raise some kind of a warning flag.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is it's not fun for anyone to have their group picked apart 1 by 1 while mezzed. This is a good change for the game, especially for tanks, who BTW really need a hand in RvR. There's a respec incoming, so I fail to see what the big deal is. Granted, the mez tactic should NEVER have been put in the game in the 1st place, but if it's something as universally hated as mez you'd have to be a little slow to never expect it to change.<br>
<br>
I expect a lot of these types of changes down the road, including changes to but not limited to: PBT stacking, Pet LOS abuse, Stealth &amp; one shotting. Don't be surprised if these abilities change eventually. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6B8E23><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bforgottentruthforeignlegion.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=lunasea>lunasea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(5/1/02 4:22:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1092.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 1.50c heheheehehehehehehehehehe</span><hr size=1> my 2 cents:<br>
Sorc's are all about CC just like tanks are all about melee and wizards all about DD.  Anytime you mess with the primary purpose of a class you better tread with caution.  Is the current Mez situation a problem? I think so.  Do tanks need something more in RvR?  Absolutely.<br>
<br>
I think they're are other ways of solving those problems without seriously impacting the sorcer class (lets face it, the change makes it better for every class EXCEPT sorcers).  Ignoring that I think Mythic reacts too quickly to perceived problems rather than thinking things through, gathering input, and providing an adequate testing ground (letting people copy chars to the test server would be a GOOD thing), what other ways could solve the problem of mez and tank ability.<br>
<br>
1) Shorten the range of mez.  Possibly 1000 feet.  This is WELL within reach of every caster.  It forces mez for use in closer combat.  Tanks would have ample opportunity to spot an incoming mezzer and take action.  It also preserves tactics with mez.  A group of all tanks and 1 cleric is not a well balanced group.  IMO a group that includes a mezer SHOULD be able to annihilate such a poorly balanced group.<br>
<br>
2) Increase ability to resist mez specifically.  Be VERY careful with this one.  There should NEVER be a situation where a class or person can always or even over 50% of the time be able to resist mez.  This makes a player make choices: do I use this +12 str item or the +12% mez resistance item?<br>
<br>
3) Reduce the effectiveness of cleric mez.  If you want to mez take a sorcerer.  A cleric is either a healer, a buffer, or a pious warrior.  IMO cleric mez is vastly overpowered.  Although they have to get up close they have the HP and AF to take the hits and the spell is an insta.  If cleric's should even have the spell I say nerf the hell out of it: 25% effective.<br>
<br>
I believe the effect of those changes would prevent sorc's from mezing from afar, reward those groups that have better class balance, AND preserve most of the effectiveness of a mezer.<br>
<br>
I have lots of ideas and if I ever gain control of this world you better run for cover! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/urajivan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rajivan</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(5/1/02 4:33:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1092.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 1.50c heheheehehehehehehehehehe</span><hr size=1> I agree alot with what you are saying Luna.  Cause if Mez is nerfed like this, Raji will NOT be in RvR until after level 50 is hit and a final respec is done to make him dish out damage.<br>
<br>
This hit takes away well over 50% of sorcerer's abilities, the only other thing the Mind line of spells gives us is a higher level pet, but those are hard to keep in RvR since we will certainly die ALOT more (like I could even do that).  Mez is our only escape from being slaughter too, so if this takes place you will see a sorcerer getting very dusty on the shelf, sorry to say that guys, but won't have much choice.<br>

Off the top of my head:<br>
<br>
1) Scramble Synapses: Short dur randomly swaps around movement keys, (i.e. left is now forward, forward now reverse, etc)<br>
<br>
2) Fear: maybe not, should be short dur and maybe slightly left and right steerable - even this is better than mez<br>
<br>
3) Berserk - Assigns a random target to a person from available targets in range, target changes only if 1st target dies, leaves range or spell expires<br>
<br>
4) Charm OTHERS' pet - Like this wouldnt be funny<br>
<br>
5) Slow Synapses - AE slow that affects style AND casting times. Should be another short one<br>
<br>
6) Veil of Insanity - Randomly swaps models around from those available in view<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, this is off the top of my head. I'm sure anyone talented can do a LOT better than this.<br>

Some of these things you are bringing up would be cool, and some of our existing skills for PvE could easily be adapted to RvR if Mythic would only allow them to work also.<br>
<br>
One for instance I thought of was the Confusion line of spells, it is no good in RvR but is a nice tool for us when soloing or getting out of a bad situation.  I think they should maybe look into having this work on players similar to the way it works on NPC, change their target to a random target that is near them every few seconds.  Or just have them running around aimlessly like the NPCs do when we hit them with it.  Now, that could be fun!!!<br>
