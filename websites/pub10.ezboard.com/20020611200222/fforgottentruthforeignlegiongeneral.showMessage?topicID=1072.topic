I would have to say that the trip was a success. In my two days there I would say that there is at least 20 less Midguard warriors in Darkness Falls. I will now tell you what happened after I awoke from my slumber.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I awoke to the quietness around me; I was elated that no Midguards found me while I slept.  I then decide to go visit the merchants.  I spoke to them and they told me that the Midguards had not regained entrance to DF (that is what they call Darkness Falls, so shall I). I started to make my rounds, a little while down I saw two Midguards fighting plated fiend. These were young but not inexperienced Mids, so I took aim. The first fell quickly, the second a dwarf was a healer so it took a few arrows to kill him. Lucky for me, just as he was about to leave the range of my arrows I was able to let the last arrow fly. This arrow was his death sentence. I continued my hunt killing a couple Trolls and Dwarfs as I made my rounds, none of which where eventful. As I was checking out an upper part of the dungeon, one of the imps came to me to say that Dalth was almost to the Mids side. After a few message to each other we decide to meet at the Mids portal. On my way up to him I would jog a bit and restealth as I entered rooms that had mobs that where no danger to me but where determined to dying to my blade.  During one of these restealths an experience dwarf ran by me. Again lady luck was with me, so I mad it up to the portal. As me and Dalth chatted the dwarf made his way to the portal room. We moved to position our selves to attack, but he saw one of us. Out of position we had to engage, so I let my arrows fly. During this time brave Dalth fought the Dwarf in hand to hand. I was deeply saddened to see him fall. But due to his death I was able to get revenge on the Dwarf and soon after he was dead.<br>
<br>
I threw Dalths body into the portal hoping it would get to a church so that he could be rezed. I continued my hunt, saddened by the death of my friend. But I rejoiced as an imp told me that again Dalth was trying to make his way to me. On his way back Dalth spotted a large group of Hibs, this is an adventure that I will let him tell you. Dalth was never able to make it back to me a second time. But I was able to rid DF of a few more mids.  During this time I came across to Mids fighting avatars, I killed the norse. But was going to leave the troll kill the avatar and comback later for him. But the troll being a little on the slow side decide to charge me while the avatar was still alive. He was quickly killed by the avatar, but I was hit by an arrow. WTF, a kobalt that I had not seen was firing on me. I was able to get away, thanks again to lady luck. I meet a very expeinced norse and tried many times to kill him but was never successful, but was able to get away each time. I also meet an experience dwarf, but he ran into the portal before I could kill him.<br>
<br>
Once I ran out of arrows I baught a Midgaurd bracer and later gave it to Tavish as a suvineer, then returned to the world of tailoring. At the end of the Night I learned that they are only two Tailors, better than me. I hope that tonight I will be able to pass one of them.<br>
<br>
Yours truly,<br>
Nimitz<br>
