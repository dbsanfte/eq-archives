He searched the usual spots but all he had found so far were those annoying lil Mosswarts. Thinking that perhaps he should go on the other side of the south ridge and sneek himself upon some golem camps he donned his helm and headed up the hill. Much to his dismay there were several people running the ridgeline back and forth hitting every camp in sight. &quot;Nothing could possibly survive this onslaught of adventurers.&quot; he thought to himself. Slowly but surely the magical shields he had cast about himself began to fade as did his hope for Lugian prey. Sighing deeply he started back following the safe trail he had marked just in case anything decided to port itself close as he was passing by. He had just rounded a tree marking the slow decline on the norther side of the ridge when he spied a familiar looking stone barrel. &quot;LUGAIN ROCK HOLDER!!!&quot; Getting closer he inspected once more. &quot;YUP! Deffinately of Lugian make!&quot; But several people were running the safe route now looking for prey along a critter barren ridge. They would spy something as it ported in and swamp it like vultures on a fresh carcass. Sighing to himself once more he took up a position within eyesight of the rock holder and began to prepare himself. The runes were easy enough to remember and soon enough he had a nice shield of magical energies surrounding him. Now all he had to do was wait and hope. <br>
  Harl noticed a fairly experianced looking adventurer headed straight his way and hid beside some brush hopefull that the fellow would not see what he was up to. The Man walked right up to him. &quot;Hail there! your a bit young to be up here on the ridge don't you think?&quot; <br>
  Harl grimaced and tried to hide his distaste at the prying insult. &quot;Me? Nay I have hunted this ridge since my younger years! Why should I be afraid to hunt near my second home?&quot;<br>
 The stranger just chuckled heartily. &quot;Your home eh? That pot you're watching has been boiling over with Lugians that are a bit out of your league son. Perhaps you should just leave the beasties up here to someone a bit more thier size lest they have thier way with yah.&quot; Laughing even harder the man turned just as a Lugian popped in. Harl was caught a bit off guard at the size of the beast and recognized it by stories he had heard Lrd Crow and Ldy Dia talk about. &quot;Look out boy! it an Obeloth!&quot; The man charged it and grinning smashed his axe into the back of its head before it could take in its surroundings, yet the only affect this had was to immediately place the beasts attention on the stranger. It grabbed up a stone and barely missed the man who was dancing in front of it poking at it looking for an opening. Harl sat down beside his tree and began to watch studiing its technique.<br>
  Again the stranger bashed it upside its head but he was not running it around as Harl had been taught to do. &quot;When fighting Lugians one must were them down a bit first. They hurl stones of great weight through the air with such force on can be crushed from a single blow. If you run and dodge the stones till it begins to take chase then you know that you have winded it and will have much better luck in taking it down&quot; Harl thought back to the discussion he had had with one of his elder guildmates. &quot;ACK!!!! Hit the DAMNED thing BOY!&quot; The stranger had been knocked to his feet and blood was trailing doen his head and neck.<br>
  Harl considered telling the man he was to young but thought better of it and joined in. Comming from behind Harl began to slash the Lugian the best he could from behind working first on the tendons in the back of its legs and then having to jump just to get at the things neck. &quot;Scratches nothing but scratches! Damn it! Face me you beast!&quot;<br>
  Almost as if on cue the thing smashed its last rock into the ground crushing the stranger in between the two. Bone crunched and Harl heard the fellow let out a gurggled sound. Turrning around the Lugain's small beady eyes flared at Harl. &quot;Have at it big guy!&quot; Harl teased. The Lugian was not looking to well, its chest was heaving with every breath and blood flowwed freely from the axewound on its head and several other deep wounds the stranger had made. It reached out with a telegraphed swipe at harls head. Harl leaned to the left and dove back in with all his wieght lunging his sword into the beasts chest. It jerked instinctively almost breaking Harl's sword off and slumped forward dead. Harl looted it and found nothing but some fish on the foul thing. Soon the Stranger came running up and looted his own corpse. &quot;I see someone came and saved yur wee duff.&quot; the stranger chimed.<br>
  &quot;Nyet. I saved me own wee duff&quot; Harl stated flatly his skin begining to crawl at the stranges attitude.<br>
  &quot;Aye lad, after I softened him up for you. Hell the breeze could have blown him over with what was left of him. I think you should run along now and go pick on some drudges or something of that sort. You are WAY to green to be up here on m'hill.&quot;<br>
  Harl stared blankly, he couldn't believe his ears. Surely this man was joking. Harl had hunted the ridge since he was 7, coaxing the younger beasts out of the shelter of thier camps and picking them off one by one. Sure things had changed a bit since then but that was no reason to tear off running for safety like he was green behind the ears! &quot;Tell you what! I take the next Obeloth that comes around. If he falls then you leave me to my own. If I fall you can take the whole blamed ridge. Deal?&quot;<br>
  The stranger cackled boisterously. &quot;Aye! Its a Deal Lad! And I am not comming to your help if it gets messy! You already said till one of you falls.&quot;<br>
 Harl nodded and took up his spot beside the tree to recast his spells and watch the strange walk off a short distance to play with some mosswarts. Harl rested up and reprepared and noticed that the fellow, strangely enough,was stil playing with the mosswarts when he heard the Lugian port in. Not an Obeloth this time, just a small one. Harl Ran up hit it once in the head ot get its attention and then ran around it in a tight circumphrance. It lodged its stones over and over, one brushing back Harl's hair it was so close. Just about the time Harl thought the Lugian would be through he saw the stranger running towards him. Harl made another round and looked but didn't see the fellow just lil purple mist as sudenly he felt a sharp pain in his back. Harl stumbled and found himself beneath a large stone as it cam hurtling towards him. Rolling out of the way just as the Stone lodged into the ground Harl cought the but of a spear in his face. <br>
 Dazed he jumped to his feet and relied upon his instincts. His sword flashed across the air before him and he felt it sink into flesh. Pulling it back he looked at the corpse before him as a million little lights sparkled down around him and he felt his pack grow heavy. &quot;MOSSWARTS!!! %$@#%$!#MOSSWARTS!!&quot; Harl suddenly knew why the stranger had been off annoying the creatures so below his own skill. SMACK! Harl fell to the ground his eyes trying to keep focus of the stars on the edges of his vision. Rolling again he shook his head and ran forward. He couldn't see much as his sight was begining to tunnel but he heard the cruhing footsteps of the Lugian close behind and the Mosswart shaman's mumblings from further back. Lights flashed and Harls breath drew shorter, his pack grew heavyier and his legs grew numb. &quot;I have to keep running, just a lil further and they will turn away and head back.&quot; Harl kept going until he felt the ground sloping downward before him. He locked his knees and let the momentum pull him along now. The breeze against his face felt good as his legs carried him faster down the hillside. He couldn't hjear the Lugian or the Mosswarts now, nothing but the breeze in his ears. thats when Harls world went black.<br>
  Harl awoke to find himself bloddied and bruised at the foot of a tree overlooking a sharp clifface. Apperantly the tree had stopped him from sailing right over. Apperantly the tree had saved him he would have to thank the Rabbit Gods again for his. After healing up his wounds and resting fro a bit he made the long march back up the hill. Upon his arrival he saw the Stranger sitting by the watching tree he had picked earlier. &quot;What are you doing back here?&quot; The stranger asked a scowel upon his face.<br>
 &quot;I didn't die.&quot; Harl stated.<br>
  &quot;Aye but you ran and to me thats proof yur too green to be up on this hill.&quot;<br>
 &quot;Mayhaps I did but not from the Lugian. I had a fair number of Mosswarts that suddenly decided to join in for no apperant reason.&quot; Harl watched closely as the stranger tried to hide his apperant mirth at the news of this. <br>
  &quot;If you weren't so lacking you would have been prepared for the unexpected.&quot; The stranger stifled a laugh and then glared at Harl. &quot;Now off with you! This be my site now. A deal is a deal.&quot;<br>
  Harl glared back. &quot;A deal?!!?!&quot; Nay I am not finished yet. I am going to kill an Obeloth or be killed by one and that is that.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Aye then! Have it your way but don't say I didn't warn you brat!&quot; The stranger got up and hovered over Harl intimidatingly. Harl stared up at him and then moved off a short distance away preparing his shields.<br>
  He had just finished his magics when a lesser Lugian portaled in not far away from where the original site was. Looking over his shoulder he saw that the stranger had noticed it to so Harl set off to draw the beasts attention first. Luckly it didn't have any stones to throw so Harl quickly dashed up and slashed its face. Drawing its attention he pulled the beast back closer to where the Obeloth had portaled in and then stopped and hit the beast again. Sure enough the stranger fell in behind the beast and began to club it from behind with his axe. it didn't take but one hit for the beast to focus on the stranger and Harl knew he had not much time. He darted out and made for the mosswart camp that was much to close for his liking to where the Obeloth would arrive. Striking for the Shaman first he made quick work of them all and turned just in time to see the Obeloth portal in. the stranger had not shielded himself and had considered the Lesser Lugian to be easy prey with it focused on Harl but now that he had its full attention it was a bit harder than he had planned. The Obeloth immediately saw its smaller brother being beaten by the stranger and strated chucking rocks. Harl grinned slyly. &quot;Heh! unpreparred eh?&quot; Harl cackled! &quot;HEY your looking sorta green there need some help!??!&quot; Harl yelled out.<br>
  But the strnager couldn't reply he had his hands full being crushed by rocks from afar and pummled from upclose he made a fatal mistake. He turned to flee.<br>
  Not having to deal with the biting axe anymore the Lesser Lugian dropped its guard and focused all its strength on the stranges back. In a mighty crushing blow it felled the poor man driving his spine into the ground. Shaking off the confusement of being attacked the lugian snorted to its elder and made its way back to its camp only to be greeted by a grinning Harl. Breathing in deeply the Lugian brought its hands once more up into the air to strike. It was the last breath it ever drew. Having dispatched the Samller one Harl focused his attention on the Obeloth. he donned the rest of his magical items just to make sure he had every favor in his corner that he could. Dashing up he whacked it for all he was worth in the back.<br>
 &quot;The beast let out a mighty bellow as blood spew forth from the wound on its shoulderblade. Trunning it hurrled a stone at the little man running in front of it.  Harl dodged and kept running. &quot;Run them in circles, Lugians are too stupid to hit a moving target. Wear them down.&quot; Harl recited the words over and over in his mind barely dodging one of the stones as it whizzed past. The Obeloth Bellowed again and Harl recognized the cries of a beast without its favorite weapon. Saying a prayer to the Rabbits and drawing inhis breath Harl turned sharply and met the beast head on. It Drews its arms up and Harl spied the hammer held in its grip. Ducking down he lunged in and swept at the beasts legs drawing blood from one of its calves. He rolled between its legs and regained his stance as the hammer crashed into the ground where he had been standing. the Obeloth turned to meet him and Harl slashed at its face again trying to distract it. It swung at him and Harl was swept off his feet as his shield deflected the blow. &quot;DAMN it means to kill me!&quot; Harl scoffed trying to reasure himself as he rolled aside and  cut at the things legs again. The Obeloth swung at Harl again but this time he was ready. Stepping back he let the momentum take the Lugian around as he stepped back in and stabbed at the creatures undefended side. Again blood spewd forth and the Lugian Bellowed in pain. Over and over they repeated this dance. Harl Dodging in and out weaving scratches and wounds all over the beast. Occasionally it would surprise him and knock him off balance racking his body with pain. Harl was wearing down. he had fought alot of things better than he was and lost before but ner in his life had he hit something so many times and it refuse to die. Frustratedly he lunged in to strike the thing in its gut and was caught by the but of its hammer. Harl heard the bones crunch in his jaw and felt his neck pop. His body hit the ground a few steps away knocking the wind out of his lungs. The thing had faked the momentum of its swing. Was it that smart? he didn't think it was possible but the beast had baited him. It knew he would lunge and it had relyed upon it. Harl felt the Obeloth's steps close up on him, every joint muscle and bone from his waist up burned with pain. Harl forced himself up the bones in his neck gritting against what was left of his jaw. Focusing out of his right eye He saw the beast draw its mighty arms up into the sky, the Hammer gleamed as if a silver tower spiring atop a mountain of grey muscle and flesh. Harl drew his breath and tensed. He watched as the Hammer came down. Everything appeared to slow down as if time had stopped. Harl Stepped just left of the hammer's path keeping it in view as he felt it brush the hairs on his arm. Leaping up as it struck into the ground he stepped onto the Obeloth's thumbs where they wrapped around the Great weapons handle. The Obeloth jerked back his arms hnads Hammer and all sending Harl sailing right towards its face. Harl Grinned and Lunged forward with all his weight pressing his sword into the beasts throat. Twisting it over and over Harl spat at the beast cursing. &quot;DIE DAMN YOU DIE!!!!! Don't you get it your dead now!&quot; The Obeloth cluched at its throat and ripped Harl free sending him smacking into the ground at the base of the watching tree. Harl gasped and lay on his back trying to catch his breath as he heard the Obeloth fall with a resounding thud. Harl tried to move and found it sent splinters of pain all over his body. Looking to where the Obeloth had fallen he watched through his good eye o make sure the thing was dead. It didn't move, not a breath or a budge. Harl sighed and found that the cool air burnt his lungs. Resting until he could heal himself up a bit he took great comfort in the fact that another would not portal till the first had decomposed, and that he had been so lucky to been thrown so close the the safe spot he had chosen before. <br>
&quot;LOL Guess I will just have to let the stranger know who's green behind the ears.&quot;<br>
  Harl laughed to himself. &quot;Deal or no deal he can have the site now;&quot;<br>
  Harl Drew himself up and walked over to the Obeloth lying face down, Harl's sword protruding from the back of its neck. Apperantly it had passed out from the shock and died when it impalled itself. Harl made note to thank the Rabbits again and retrieved his sword and the Obeloths hammer. Turning to survey the landscape before he made his trip home he spied something shining in the grass not a few feet from where he was standing. It was in the very spot the stranger had died. Hadn't he gotten his corpse yet? Harl focused his attention and tried to contact the stranger yet he was no where to be found. Harl grinned to himself his jaw aching, and stepped over to retrive the object. He picked up the helm and looked it over. Upon inspection it had a small plate in it that had been engraved. it read: Supirior Helm, from the Halls of Helms. Insp22<br>
  Heh not quite his size but he would have plenty of time to grow into it! &quot;Besides, I am green!&quot; He cackled, and walked off down the hill towards Mayoi.<br>
