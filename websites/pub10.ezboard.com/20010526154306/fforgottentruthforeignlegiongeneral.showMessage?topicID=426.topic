He was incredibly strong and handsome.  She was a winsome archer.  His heart pumped 50W Malice for Evil Creatures faster than an Indy racecar.  Her heart burned hotter than the nuclear fires at Chernobyl; white hot for the monsters, red hot for her companion!<br>
Together, they crossed the Northern Plains, Holtburg....Collier....Neydisa castle.  They left a trail blazing with destruction and Passion the like of has not been seen since the beginning of Time!<br>
The warrior had a hidden flaw however.  His memory was shorter than the archer's skirt.  He had forgotten (heh-heh)how cruel women can be! He bludgeoned a path into the Crater for nothing more than to see the dazzling smile of this blond archer.  He revelled in helping her to fulfill her desire!<br>
And then?  The journey was over.  She obtained the Hollow Dagger she had wanted, and she dumped him.  His stomach felt worse than after he had eaten a 5 pound fruitcake from Walmart.<br>
But time goes on.  The Mighty Warrior assuaged his broken heart by crushing the skulls of a thousand monsters.  <br>

She called to him immediately, hoping he would desire to see her.  He did.  She wanted an adventure - as did he.  Off they went - he led the way, gallantly clearing the path for her as they forged ahead through the dangerous yet beautiful lands.  She followed him - not knowing the way, not caring - for she would happily follow him to the ends of Norrath - even to sure death.  Across the world they went, slaughtering foes as they trudged through snow, waded through mud, and ran across rock and field.  Finally they came to their destination.  Overcome with thanks - for he had assisted her in obtaining a new and deadly weapon - and overwhelmed with exhaustion, she prepared for the long journey home. But alas!! His intent was not to escort her home, but to stay here!  Out in the middle of nowhere, Lifestoned here, with no way back to civilization but in her coffin void of all valuable items, for she knew she could not make it back alone - she needed him.... he announced his intent to stay - with no mention of wishing her to stay with him, and although she stood before him, helpless, with tears in her eyes, he turned his back and went down the stairs, never to look back upon her.

<br>
There was a desert wind blowing that night. It was one of those hot dry winds that come down through the mountain passes and curl your hair and make your nerves jump and your skin itch. On nights like that every booze party ends in a fight. Meek little wives feel the edge of the carving knife and study their husbands' necks. Anything can happen. You can even get a full glass of ale at the tavern in Ayan Baqur.<br>
<br>
I walked back towards my tent and started up the hill.  It was a nice walk if you liked grunting. I felt like an amputated leg; I needed a drink, I needed a lot of life insurance, I needed a vacation, I needed a nice little cottage in Cragstone. What I had was a mattie coat, an olthoi helm, and a 113 yumi.<br>
<br>
The tent had a smell of old carpet and furniture oil and the drab anonymity of a thousand shabby lives. I huddled in a corner and opened a bottle of Ispar Stout, not caring about the mess that surrounded me. I figured I'd be back at the lifestone soon enough. What did it matter where you lay once you were dead?  In a dirty sump or in a marble tower on top of a high hill.  You were dead, you were sleeping the big sleep, you were not bothered by things like that.  Oil and water were the same as wind and air to you.  You just slept the big sleep, not caring about the nastiness of how you died or where you fell.  Me, I was part of the nastiness now. I drained the bottle and opened another.<br>
<br>
And then she walked in. It was a blonde. A blonde to make an Adjantite bishop kick a hole in a stained glass window. She gave me a smile I could feel in my hip pocket. Then her hands dropped and jerked at something and the robe she was wearing came open and underneath it she was as naked as Harvestgain Morn but a darn sight less coy...<br>

    Hmmmmmmmmm.. Tis a story of m'past you wish for eh?<br>
  ::Twas not such an uncommon request at the campfire, but twas the first time Harl had been truly put to the question of  how he had come to this land called Dereth.  He considered them all to be close friends but would they understand? Scrunching up his brow in contemplation he thought better of it and decided twould be best if He started with something simple::<br>
<br>
    &quot;Twas quite some time ago that I left my home if you can call it that. Twas not my real home but one that I had lived long enough on that you could call it that.&quot; &quot;How long it was between leaving that home and arriving here I can not say.&quot; &quot;I ...well....slept you could call it, for quite some time after being cast.... ::Harls pauses to reconsider his wording and wets his lips in consideration:: Leaving...aye some time after leaving my home. &quot;  &quot;Twas a beautifull place, very strange for those of you who would call this place normal by any means but nonetheless beautifull.&quot; &quot;Twas that place that I met M'love....Aslynn, and also lost her.&quot;  &quot;In the early years was a rather peacefull time but that was before the Plauges.&quot;  &quot;Not any Plauges mind you. Nay these were far worse than anything previously imaginable.&quot; <br>
::Harl pauses again and takes a deep breath::<br>
  &quot;Strange powers and odd energies began infesting our world. Creatures that had once been men arose and tried to establish themselves as gods. New cults took hold and gathered arcane and deadly energies together as if in attempts ot hoard it all for themselves. Some even say that Lucifer himself walked the earth in those final days.&quot; &quot;It was during this time that a small band of friends joined forces with thier enimies to defeat these new foes.&quot; &quot;The battle swayed to and fro over the years, finaly comming to a head on a hill above a small city.&quot; &quot;I lived in this city and had not long before met M'love there.&quot; &quot;Times were hard yet just the sight of her could lift any cloud that would hide my true path from me.&quot; &quot;Truthfully at times I believed her to be all I had.&quot; ::Harl swallows and clears his throat. Pausing to stare into the flames once more he takes a swig of his ale and continues his tale::<br>
   &quot;Aye.....hard times, but made simpler by her presance.&quot; &quot;Aslynn was quite a remarkable person then. She still is I suppose if she still lives to this day.&quot; &quot;She had come to us during the time of the plauge, mayhaps the ONLY good thing out of that time.&quot; &quot;Pale skinned and a very lithe from. She appeared to glide from place to place as if a cat with wings. Each movement comprised of soft fluidity.&quot; ::Taking another swig Harl mumbles:: &quot;Aye most angels are that way though I suppose.......&quot;<br>
::Looking to them curious if they heard his foolish mumblings he returns to the tale::<br>
      &quot;Anyway...Like I said This small band of selfproclaimed heros locked horns with some foul scoundral that had become so empowered that he truly thought he was Lucifer himself.&quot; &quot;Slowly one by one the heros began to fall before his might. The lights of the battle lit the sky as bright as Day.  Divine energies flying haphazardly with tremendous force at eachother, large explosions causing minor quakes to topple some of the taller buildings in the city below.&quot; &quot;Aye......finally it came down to two young lads against this lothesome beast.&quot; &quot;You could feel the silence before you could hear it. Twas  as if the very breath was sucked out of your lungs and being drawn to the top of that now darkened hill.&quot; &quot;Lightning raged around the hilltop but not one clap of thunder. Nay no sound at all.&quot; &quot;Twas then that M'love made a fatefull decision. Thinking that she had the power to help she raced towards them only to be caught in the middle of it all.&quot; &quot;A bolt of lightning shot down before her as she approached the group blinding her to her path.&quot; &quot;Quickly the Beast snatched her up as if plucking a harpstring and held her tight to him threatening the two lads with her death.&quot; &quot;One of the two so shocked by this new turn of events was enraged and spat at the beast dareing him to do it. Telling him that if he did his life was forefeit.&quot; <br>
   ::Harl chokes on his ale and triess ot save face by taking another heavy swig. So heavy that it spills into his eyes and streams down his cheeks:: ::averting his eyes downward from the light of the flame and pulling his hood over his head he begins again::  I can remember the sneer on that bastard's face as he......as he ran her face into the ground.........<br>
<br>
::Pausing a few moments he takes a finaly swig on his ale and looks to the bottom of his mug for more. Not finding his sought release he speaks::  &quot;Aye.....that lad was so ticked off that he ran right up and grabed the beast by the throat. Then the beast to him in the same manner. Locked they were, the energies flowing off the two so staticly that lightling struck them over and over. the very ground ripped itself usunder and rose around them. It felt like the whole world would tear itself to shreds and circle them. Thats when the other Lad stepped over. Icteric they called him......Aye....that one was a spooky one E was.  The priest of chaos they called him..... he stepped up and grabbed one of each of thier wrists in his greying hands. Then it happened... A brilliant flash of light. A wind so strong it knocked over everything in its path.... Grass was ripped out of the ground by the force of the shockwave and a thunderclap so loud it pushed the clouds aside. Then...finally, Darkness. Sweet nothingness of the void. I do not know how long I was there but only that when I awoke, Aslynn and my world, my home....were no more. ::Looking into his mug once more he grimaces and drops it to the ground staring at it blankly:: Aye...but then....twas but a tale..... only the Gods know any diffrent. ::Slowly Harl gets up and with a nod dismisses himself muttering as he fades into the darkness:: One day Luce....I swear it....One day...............<br>

That was just a collection of lines from various Chandler novels that I pasted together and changed a little (&quot;a mattie coat, an olthoi helm, and a 113 yumi&quot; was originally &quot;a coat, a hat, and a gun&quot; in &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot;).<br>
