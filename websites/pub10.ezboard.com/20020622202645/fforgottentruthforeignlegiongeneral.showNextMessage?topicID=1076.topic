I pray that this imp merchant I have hired is able to get this letter into your hands safely.<br><br>Last night I decide to try to make it to the Hibernian side of Darkness Falls in hopes to hit them as they came into it. At the time it looked like they were trying to take control of the necessary forts to gain access. As I worked my way down I got to our last portal out of Darkness Falls. There I saw two much more experience Midguard warriors fighting a cambion. I saw that it was there goal to kill an other in hopes of getting more seals for the imp merchants. I studied there battle plan, the troll would engage the cambion while his kobalt friend would heal him. I noticed a flaw in there tactics. The troll would attack the next cambion before the kobalt had regain all his power. So when he attacked the next cambions I let arrows fly at the kobalt. It took a few arrows but I dropped the kobalt, but during the battle I saw the coward troll run thru the portal.<br><br>Now I continued my trip to the hib side, but I came to an inpass. There was a room full of cambions and to there right was a hall filled with more cambions. Straight ahead I could see an other hall filled with essence shredders or naburite drinkers, hard to tell from a distance. All of these are notorious stealth detectors. I studied the room for a long time tried to find a way around it and came up empty. So I decide to try to go to the Midguard side, even if I had never been there before or how to get there. I know the path would be filled with more stealth detectors, but then I remembered the two Midguards I saw earlier, maybe the path they cleared was still open. As I made my way from room and halls filled with essence shredders and naburite drinkers, I realized that a path had indeed been cleared on my right hand side going into midguard. Then I came to an other inpass, the final path going up into midguard was filled with essence shredders, naburite drinkers and cambions. I studied the situation for a very long time. In one of my excursion up to the platform I saw a group of 4 midguards fight cambions, but alas they where not attacking the cambions blocking my path.  Final after I could not wait any longer and being sure the path behind me had closed, I made my move. I noticed that essence shredders and naburite drinkers where moving much to often for me to try and sneak by, but the cambions would fly in one spot for a bit then patrol again. So if i waited for the far cambion to be near the far wall and the one blocking my path up the ramp had her back to me. There was a small chance that I would be able to sneak by. So I said my prays and attempted this risky maneuver. My prays where answered, I made it past the cambions and it looked like a cambion I had not seen had  been engaged by the Midguard group and died just as I made my way past them. <br><br>The rest of the way up I would see groups of 2 or more fighting the demons in Darkness Falls, but they where all to close to each other for me to engage. As I moved my way up I finally got to room that was empty. Having remembered that I had seen a kobalt/dwarf team fighting in the room previous I decide to dispatch the world of one of them. This group was much smarter that the first, they would wait for the kobalt to regain all its power. The dwarf was more experience that I, but the kobalt seem to be equal to me in experience. So the kobalt would be my next victim. It took a few arrows to kill the kobalt again, because he was able to heal a few times. But I was able to drop it, but soon after the dwarf killed its target and made its way to me. Again my  luck held out, just as he made his way into my room I was able to stealth again.<br><br>I continued to stealth and explore, along the way I killed a very young troll in hopes to luring one of his comrades. It was not my intention to kill him since I knew trolls cold take a beating, but look like the relics we have recently capture made my shot stronger than I taught it would be. His comrade did not come. It looked like he was more interested in buying stuff from the merchants than helping a comrade. I made my way down again a saw another very young midguard, but he was a sheather, so a danger to me so I had to kill him. I saw two more young but experienced mids, enough to be a small challenge. So I showed them what Darkness Falls dirt taste like. <br><br>Then I explored more saw trolls that would be too risky for me to kill. I went back to my old spot where the dwarf/kobalt team had been. There was now a group of 5 midguard there and fighting cambions only one at the time. Not once did they drop below 3/4 life, they were cowards taking no risk. they where all more or as experience as I except for one. I could tell that the norse was very close to being my equal but not quit there. He was not doing much in the battles, a rare heal during and some after the battle was over. So I tried to take him out, dang it takes a lot of arrows to drop a healer. But I was able to. I tried to get away but just before I was able to stealth a smelly troll farted on me and I was poisoned. So I made a run for the portal a long ways off. but on the way I angered two demons. So i had to fight them, but I chose a spot that hopefully the midguard would take a few second longer to find me. I was able to kill both demons with only a fraction of life remaining in me. Also stealthed just as a kobalt turned the corner. Again lady luck was shining on me, from what I could tell  3 of the midguards stayed to fight the cambion. They sent the kobalt after me and he was also jumped by two demons (I saw two sacks of coins on the ground). I was able to kill my two demons just before he killed his and stealth. I rested and explored some more, the group of 5 had called  a group of 4 more to them and I knew it was time to call it a night. So I made my way to find a hiding place to sleep. On my way I saw a very young midguard caster. It did hurt me to kill him but I taught his death would disrupt the groups below for a few minutes while I slept.<br><br>Yours <br>Nimitz<br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/uapo44.showPublicProfile?language=EN>apo44</A> at: 4/22/02 2:13:16 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6B8E23><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Wamba</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(4/22/02 1:51:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1067.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Heh-heh</span><hr size=1> Nimitz, this story is WAY cool! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/usareshft.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saresh FT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(4/22/02 6:58:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1067.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Heh-heh</span><hr size=1> im going to cause some serious heart ache in that place when i get back home!!!<br><br>bet manuevering through scouting npcs was fun as hell! <p><BR>Saresh  LvL 35 Infiltrator<BR>Numms  LvL 12 Cleric<BR>Miradia  LvL 13 Wizardess<BR>Forgotten Truth (Palomides)<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6B8E23><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ugizzifurrfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gizzi Furrfoot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(4/23/02 5:00:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1067.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Heh-heh</span><hr size=1> *wiggles her furry feet in awe of the wondrous tale of adventure* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bforgottentruthforeignlegion.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dia>Dia</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ireseau.com/usagers/jfn/Dia.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(4/23/02 10:27:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1067.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Heh-heh</span><hr size=1> This is a very cool strory Nim, I bet your having  a great time, but on the prey side of the story, it makes me shiver.<br>I wish you would tell us about those who had defeated you so we could learn how to defend ourselves.<br>Archers are uber because they can stealth, distance attack, critic and re-stealth.

I do agree that they can kick an archers butt if they find them... However, it seems like &quot;detect hidden&quot; does not really work as well as advertised and many (most?) archers have attact range that will be outside of detection range. <br><br>I'm still a super-archer-noob, but I seem to see infiltrators at just about the same time they see me or maybe just a little bit latter. This is with about half my level in stealth right now. Having an inf nearby would be a good thing, but you may have to absorb an arrow or two before the inf can do their job.<br><br>What I think an infiltrator can really do well for you is act as a human... er... toon... watchdog. I think that many archers will move on to greener pastures rather then risk an unfortunate death to a lurking infiltrator... popping into view once in a while is a good way to scare off some folks. It's a lot like Dia said, archers can pick thier targets and are generally fairly careful. If I KNOW there is a stealthed character around, that changes the odds considerably.<br><br>Dia has already covered most of the &quot;archer secrets&quot; that I have heard before. It is very difficult to be completely safe from a patient archer. If the archer decides to plink away at you, there is really no alternative other then to go on the offensive and try to track them down. They can dish the damage far faster then a regular tank can heal especially when the tank cannot ever sit or leave combat mode.<br><br>My (admittedly) uninformed opinion.<br>Cheers, <p>Niz, Tavik, etc...<BR>Forgotten Truth</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ubasilicus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Basilicus</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(4/23/02 5:51:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1067.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A report from behinde enemy lines.</span><hr size=1> Don't know how well this applies to Albion, but here is what I did to win against archers with my Mid Healer.<br><br>After I took the first hit, I immediately started casting stun.

With Dunkar I would have to be standing right next to Nimitz to see him, but Dalth has a larger detection range.

Hit the /stick command to make sure I don't fluff this up, she still there and it looks like she is about to shoot someone.

Elated I nailed the follow-up style, and nothing happened.  Thinking it was a lag spike I hit it again, and again, and again...but all I see is a silly message saying &quot;You can't perform that command while laying down&quot;.  Laying down?  Impossible, I was just attacking someone.  That is when I noticed the bright red message indicating Kris has him me for 1040 points, type /release you schmuck cause you DEAD!  <br><br>Morale of the story, as a stealther if you can see them and they are purple, chances are they saw you a long time ago and had enough time to set up a perfect close quarters Crit Strike to your left eyeball.<br><br>Dalth, Doormat to the World <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/usareshft.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saresh FT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(4/24/02 1:51:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1067.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Detect Hidden</span><hr size=1> Thats ok Dalth....

(17k RP's or thereabouts, and I quit playing the character last year)<br><br>For the caster classes, a couple recommendations.  First is hardware believe it or not -- you can really benefit from macros with a Nostromo N50 gamepad.  Curiosity (Iska on MLF) had a great anti-archer macro setup that wizzies could use as well.  With her theurgist, she had a macro that auto-faced, quick-cast a nuke and then cast a pet.  If the archer was in nuke range, he was interrupted right away.  If out of nuke range, the pet would be quick cast instead since it has a slightly longer range.  Either is typically enough to convince an archer type to move on -- you can't shoot with a pet beating on you, and if you are in nuke range you are toast as well (since the nukes are faster).  If they stayed to fight after being nuked or with a pet on them they were typically toast.<br><br>Did this always work?  Nope -- but it at least gives a cloth wearer a 50/50 chance.  You can do the same thing without a macro, but it's definitely tougher.  Wizzies can exchange a pet for a bolt with even better results.  We were at least playing with a defensive armsman at the time, who could block arrows and run down the archers ...<br><br>For myself (the smite cleric) I'd depend on insta-heal and charging the target.  If I could get into base-line smite range (the 3 second casts) they probably weren't going to get away.  In DF this would be more problematical unfortunately, since in RvR you are (or at least should be) always ready for an attack.  In DF this isn't the case, unless you have had some death spam to prepare with ...<br><br>For assassins ... you have the good fortune of being Albion, you don't want to mess with a smite cleric.  ;-)  I don't think I ever sat down long enough for a PA to land on me while sitting, and I was high enough level for a PA not to be able to kill me in one shot.  Insta, mez, heal self, cure poison, nuke, stun, nuke, nuke -- free RP's.  :-)  Use a lot of caution when fighting mid healers for the same reason, even if they can't nuke.  (This is pretty obvious, but what the heck...maybe someone didn't know.)  Granted, this was before the boost to points for assassin classes, they are probably more formidable now.  I want to kill healers myself, so I'm going to try a spec that's light on poison and very heavy on crit/thrust.<br><br>Now for my story ...<br><br>In the newbie BG, a bunch of mids managed to stage a breakout and push the albion forces back when they were camping the mid PK.  A lot of deaths on both sides, but the mids managed to wipe out the albions -- so they were recovering.  The single healer was rezzing the fallen ...<br><br>So, the mids (for some reason) were in 3 slightly spread out groups.  I'd already killed the only shadowblade (who had low stealth anyway) so I wasn't too concerned about being detected -- he hadn't been rez'd yet.  The healer was just slightly outside the guard aggro range ... sitting down to regain mana.  heh.  heh.<br><br>So, I zig-zagged between the two other middy groups.  Stand in front of the healer sitting down, land the PA -- 99% dead.  One style lands the finishing hit.  Unfortunately, my ISP started having problems right at that time or I would have gotten away cleanly ... I almost got away ANYWAY it caught them by surprise so badly.  (I also ditched my ISP the next morning I was so ticked off ... now I have cablemodem.)  A caster got a bolt off just as I stealthed, and uncovered me -- otherwise it would have been a totally clean kill.  However -- that was the only healer.  I'm sure I messed them up a bit.  :-)<br><br>Moral of the story?  I had passed up several sure rez-kills because I wanted to take out the healer and I didn't want to give away the fact that I was there.  People dropping dead all around you tend to do that.  The beauty of being a stealth class is that you decide when and where the fight is going to begin, and you do it with surprise.  (Obviously, these were newbies ... but they should have been a lot more cautious).  <br><br>General advice, especially for folks new to RvR:  If you are going to sit down, do it behind guard aggro range.  Group with a minstrel and only sit for a few seconds at a time -- keep moving and assassins don't have time to line up a PA.  Keep bladeturn up (for casters always, for others group with a theurgist) and that will negate an archers crit shot.  Keep moving anyway, the archers can't land a crit if you are out of range).  Stick together in a group -- even if you are chasing down single enemies, because if you disperse, you are in trouble.  Know the area you are fighting in, because when you DO get dispersed, you need to have a place to meet up again as quickly as you can.  Non-stealth classes can't RvR effectively alone, but in a group, they can gank people for hours.  :-)<br><br>If you are going on a grey-ganking session in Odins or Emain, the not splitting up part is especially important.  At some point, the people you are ganking are going to whine for help and you'll get a big force after you.  (I'm assuming this still happens -- maybe with DF in the game the frontiers are dead).  Typically even the higher level groups will split up in 3's or 4's to spread out to find you ... you can roll the small groups, and then move again.  Keep moving and you can repeat until you have them bottled up at the port fort.  (It's kind of sad to see a single group of high 40's -&gt; 50's have a few dozen mids or hibs bottled up scared to come out when they are uncoordinated).<br><br>Ok, that's enough.  Too long as it is.  Now go out and kill somebody.  :-)<br><br>--Belsader, 24 Infiltrator Palomides<br>--Belsarius, 42 Smite Cleric, MLF<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6B8E23><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bforgottentruthforeignlegion.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=curiosity>Curiosity</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(4/25/02 11:28:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1067.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Detect Hidden</span><hr size=1> Belsader is right the macro gamepad had really helped me out as a caster in RvR (43 Theurgist).  He mentioned my tactic for when I was solo or in a small group.  Since I could cast so fast (2 sec ice spells) once I got the archer interrupted (providing he was in my range) I could get more casts in before he could get his bow up and finish him.  Usually they were not in my range though and the backup pet would at least be there to scare them off.  <br><br>However when I hunted in larger well organized groups I used a different macro.  Instead of blasting the archer I would try to mez or root them then the pet was last resort there too.  It was usually more detrimental to my health but there was more of an assurance the group could get the archer when they were on ice.  Theurg Mez was always kind of pointless, the range was too short to use effectively and it had a 1 sec longer cast time than root.  However it couldn't hurt to add it to the macro since my macros were more of a &quot;If.. then&quot;  sort of setup.  Macro would /face then quickcast and then hit Mez, Root, and pet quickly so that whatever was in range first would get cast then the rest was up to me.  <br><br>Just my old tactics, I know the game has changed a bit since I last played Iska on Morgan Le Fay but I only see these as getting better since they put in the faster casting dex boost.  When I had max dex buffs on I was a killing machine <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Bel told me to put in my realm point score though I don't think it is very impressive anymore since months have passed.  My old character should still be on the top 25 list on the herald but I just looked and for some reason she isn't listed there.  It is possible I need to log her back in and kill a few more enemies before I will get back on the list.  She has not been logged on since I canceled my account back around December.  I have approx 52,000 rpts.  Guessing mind you so give or take 1,000.<br><br>--Curiosity, 24 Minstrel Palomides<br>--Iska, 43 Theurgist MLF <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=1067.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=1067.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1067.topic&index=13><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=1067.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.threadControl?topicID=1067.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1067.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1067.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub10.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="forgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral">General<option value="forgottentruthforeignlegionlinks">Links<option value="forgottentruthforeignlegionmembers">Members<option value="forgottentruthforeignlegionquotes">Quotes<option value="forgottentruthforeignlegionfrm4">Uber Loot<option value="forgottentruthforeignlegionfrm5">AO Guild Notes<option value="forgottentruthforeignlegionfrm6">The Shop At Home Forum!</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#5F9EA0>- </font><a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bforgottentruthforeignlegion>Forgotten Truth Foreign Legion</a><font color=#5F9EA0> - </font><a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral>General</a> <font color=#5F9EA0> - </font><a href="http://www.forgottentruth.com">Home</a><font color=#5F9EA0> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
