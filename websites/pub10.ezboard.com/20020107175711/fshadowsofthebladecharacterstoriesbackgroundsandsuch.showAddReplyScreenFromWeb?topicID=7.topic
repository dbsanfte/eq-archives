moods and mating</span><hr size=1> &quot;Damn you, and your stupid . . &quot; <br>
<br>
Crieth roughly tore the Combine blade from her own rapidly stiffening hand. Her corpse stared back at her with a strange intensity to it's lifeless eyes. <br>
<br>
She was seething. <br>
<br>
&quot;Seething is for the impotent - and we of the Dead are POWERFUL&quot; her trainers would have told her, were they here. <br>
<br>
&quot;And you know where you can stick your power&quot; she would have replied, probably with a graphic demonstration using her blade. Crieth could be dangerously unstable when provoked. Come to think of it, she just was dangerously unstable, it was probably written down some place in one of Innoruuks great books (or the Obsidian Blade's membership profiles). <br>
<br>
She smiled for all too brief a moment. The dark déjà vu with the young enchantress was fading fast in her memory, and a fresh skein of mental scar tissue had formed over the terrors of her own past. Crieth was of course like all the young intrinsically bright of spirit and ephemeral of mood - somewhere inside anyway -, and in general her quirky humour would surface given the chance. <br>
<br>
Life had been good to her lately, with her joining into the comradeship of the Blade, and a burgeoning friendship with the magician Mephala. Yet . . . there it was again, and the gates of darkness slammed shut on her blossoming brightness. <br>
<br>
&quot;And this place STINKS&quot;. She punctuated the words with futile brushes at the noisome swamp muck that coated the inside of the tunic she was recovering. She could of course cope with the stench - this was Innothule and the two went together. She was Teir 'Dal, and could tolerate the assorted wildlife that was exploring uncharted regions of her flesh from the dark interior of her leggings. But she damn sure didn't have to like it. She looked down at the slime caking her lithe figure, hands incongruously gentle tracing the subtle and sensual curves of her half naked form. <br>
<br>
&quot;If only . . .&quot;, the words were stillborn. <br>
<br>
It was a chance meeting with Lokus and Sensi that had brought on the latest batch of malhereusement to her. That and the all too close to home wedding of Morrigu and Dantrazz. <br>
<br>
Several months had passed she had made the (what seemed to her) simple and practical decision to seek a mate. She had followed all the steps she could think of: <br>
<br>
1) chosen the infinitely suitable candidate in her usual manner (random chance meeting when she was in the appropriate mood) <br>
2) not advertised her intentions too obviously (in fact not mentioning it to him at all - just in case) <br>
3) waited for the appropriate moment to deal with the issue (which never seemed to arrive) <br>
<br>
And then he was gone. Just like that - gone. <br>
<br>
It wasn't that she was in love or anything so stupid and . . she spat . .&quot;paleskin&quot; like. It was just that the time was right, he was right and then . . . nothing - just the same aching void inside. <br>
<br>
&quot;Damn it - why couldn't you just say something you fool&quot;. <br>
<br>
She kicked the unresponsive husk of the now empty corpse into the murky waters of the swamp. It swallowed it with a barely perceptible sucking sound, like a tired infant finally sated with it's mothers milk. <br>
<br>
And now of course he had returned, again just like that. And she was seething over it. <br>
<br>
If she had been able to rationalise the situation, his behaviour would have been perfectly natural to her, whose own disappearances often lasted several months. And anyway, he didn't know of her decidedly odd intentions, and probably wouldn't have been interested anyway. <br>
<br>
But of course Crieth wasn't rational, at least emotionally, and especially when it came to her relationships with others. Alas this was all too often the way of all the fairer emotions when they came across the darker side of her psyche. <br>
<br>
Straightening and clutching the bright magical blade to her breast with all the passion that should have been reserved for her unrequitted lover, Crieth stared off to the North, and seethed over missed opportunities, loneliness, and her own foolishness.<br>
<br>
Crieth,<br>
