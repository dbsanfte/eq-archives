The next step is someone called Kaiaren, who is located at Loc -1609, -2679, just as you come into the upper Sebilis Ruins in Trakanons Teeth<br>
'Hail Kaiaren'<br>
<br>
Kaiaren says, &quot; AHHH get it away from me go away .. leave me alone&quot;. <br>
<br>
'What Celestial Fists' <br>
<br>
Kaiaren says 'Eh? What's that? Bah! That was destroyed long ago. Don't waste my time with fairy taAAAAAGGHHH GET IT AWAY!!!! HELP!!! They're all over MEHEHEHEHEEEEEEee!!<br>
<br>
Handing Kaiaren the book Celestial Fists prompts: Kaiaren's eyes open wide and he attacks you!<br>
<br>
Upon death he says 'Not bad.. Now lets see if you can find my trueform if you do we discuss this further.'<br>
Note: You do not need to kill Kaiaren, as giving him the book and feigning him off works fine. <br>
The next step is to find Kaiaren's true form, which spawns when the book is given to the mad Kaiaren. He is also called Kaiaren, and is located near the lake in Trakanons Teeth. He spawns at approx 300, 2400 in a building next to the lake. He is level 60+ and indifferent. <br>
When you hand him the book, he says the following:<br>
Important Note: The Book is returned to you, but it is NOT the same. The properties of this book have now been changed, and although you cannot tell, it is different. Please do not hand this book over again until the final stage.<br>
Kaiaren says 'Now, then. Where did you find this, monk? This is not just some light reading to be borrowed from the town library. Who gave this to you? <br>
I got it from lheao' <br>
<br>
Kaiaren says 'Hmmm, never heard of him. Well, it doesn't matter, the book is here now. Curse that idiot for writing it in the first place. Not even sure why I let him stick around. If you ever see that clown monk Aradiel kick him in the shins for me! At any rate, I suppose you'd like to find the Fists and [have a nice chat with them], eh? Their master owes me much. I would reward you well if you were to bring me proof of the master's defeat'<br>
'I would like to have a nice chat with them'<br>
Kaiaren says 'Yes, I suppose you would. All you children looking for fame and glory will eventually learn the poison of ambition. But how will you find them? They are able to meld with their elements seamlessly and they certainly have no interest in fooling with the likes of you. No, you will need to get their attention. Fortunately, I know [how you can do this].<br>
<br>
'how can I do this?' <br>
<br>
Kaiaren says, 'My guess is that the weakest of the Fists will be the easiest to draw out. he is egotistical and arrogant. How he came to master the Discipline of Fire, I do not know. He will most likely be in another form, one of his element. When you find the one you believe to be the Fist, you must challenge him. If you use his true name, Eejag, in your formal challenge, he will respond. A flame can burn intensely but it cannot last for long. Know this when you battle him.<br>
~~The Celestial Fists~~<br>
~~Eejag~~<br>
In Lavastorm, there is an wandering Imp, larger than the others, called 'a fire Sprite'. The sprite looks to be pretty common and seems to travel from the druid ring to the southeast and back again. He is also a very low lvl imp. If Eejag is already spawned he won't shout to the zone when you say the challenge to the sprite. To initiate the sequence, hail the Fire Sprite with:<br>
'I Challenge Eejag' <br>
<br>
The fire sprite disappears and the zone gets a message... <br>
<br>
Eejag shouts What imbecile dares challenges a Celestial Fist?! Do you even know who you are challenging? HA! You are nothing but an insect! I will enjoy crushing you, I have not charred the flesh of an idiot in decades! If you truly wish to fight me, the battle shall be held in my own element. Come, challenger, come down to the pits of flowing fire.<br>
Now go to the fire pit by the Solesek's and under the middle smoke plume, half way down an Iksar will be swimming. He is lvl 55, max hits for 157, but seems to swing very slow. Eejag will NOT be pulled. He refuses to move from his spawn spot, which is about half way down the lava, right in the middle. When you get summoned, you appear on the bottom of the lake directly beneath him, where he can hit you, but you cant hit him. He can summon you regardless of if you are in the lava or not. Visibility is VERY bad.<br>
Tactics: Min 2 Groups, and buff everyone with Dead Man Floating, Enduring Breath and Regen. One person goes down and gets the target then comes back up. Everyone charges in, including the Clerics, so they could do group heals, as the lava does not interrupt spells. Everyone then assists the person with target and find him via the /yell command.<br>
Other tactics involve all floating above him, and sending the tanks and caster pets in, and popping back up to the surface to the Clerics for heals.<br>
Once killed, he drops nothing but the Charred Scale, which Identifies as the Remains of the Fists of Fire<br>
Note: Eejag can be summoned again immediatly after death by challenging the Fire Sprite again, there is no 'respawn time'.<br>
You then hand the Charred Scale to the True Form in Trakanon's Teeth. The scale is returned to you, and you get the following: <br>
Kaiaren says 'Ahhh, impressive indeed! Now that you have broken the chain of the Fists, the others may come toppling down if you persevere. The Fist of Air is now the weakest, then Earth, and finally Water before the master of them all, Vorash. You must defeat them in order, proving the demise of the last to draw out the one you are after. The task before you now is to take this scale and show it to the Fist of Air wherever he may be. Good luck, Zadkiel . <br>
<br>
May your weapons always hit and your spells never *fizzle* <br>
