==============================================<br>
Comparative Analysis of All Classes, All Realms (Vol. I) <br>
<br>
This Analysis seeks out to compare the differences in spells and abilities between class equivalents across realms and in relation to their standing in the realm as a whole. Not included are any issues outside of class balance, such as frontier mob aggression, dungeon itemization, and hunting ground availability. <br>
<br>
I will only give brief solutions to classes if any to balance them. Mostly it will consist of pointing out the actual imbalances and letting the presentation of information speak for itself. Everything is presented in a readily accessible format that solutions should almost be readily visible from the raw comparisons alone. This way, it also serves as a resource for everyone to quickly cross-index class information and the tools to make sound coherent arguments with a point of reference that everyone can have access to now. <br>
<br>
For most classes, I will compare racial ability scores along with access to equipment types and the abilities granted to that class. <br>
<br>
For spellcasting classes, I am also going to include the full list of secondary and specialization spell lines that they have access to, along with numbers that calculate all the secondary spells a class gets and the average number of specialization spells they get if they chose a random discipline. <br>
<br>
At the end of each section, I will rate the class overall with a score that both represents the balance it has with each other and balance as a contributing member of that realm. At the very end of this post is an Average score for each realm. <br>
<br>
I’ll start off with an easy example that is well balanced so I can set the tone about how each set of analyses are tabulated: <br>
<br>
<br>
*** ARMSMAN, WARRIOR, HERO *** <br>
<br>
ARMSMAN: Protect III, Intercept, Parry <br>
WARRIOR: Protect III, Evade I, Parry <br>
HERO: Protect III, Intercept, Parry, Evade I <br>
<br>
ARMSMAN: Plate Mail, Polearms, Large Shield, Crossbow <br>
WARRIOR: Chain Mail, 2h/1h, Large Shield, Thrown Weapon <br>
HERO: Scale Mail, Celtic Spear, Large Shield, Short Bow <br>
<br>
Armsman have both the best armor and the most singularly damaging weapon (but also the slowest). Highlanders are slightly optimized for melee so Albion ranks second in race selection. They lack any Evasion skills however. <br>
<br>
Warriors have access to the second best armor. Their weapon skills work differently, in that specializing in a specific weapon type grants both 1-handed and 2-handed use, granting flexibility in melee options. Most Midgard races are specialized for Melee. The only small drawback is lack of Intercept skill. <br>
<br>
Heroes also have the second best armor. They can use Celtic Spear which works like Polearm in a realm equivalent respect. None of Hibernia’s races are optimized for Melee, with the closest being the giant race Firebolgs have 10 points diverted towards empathy. Heroes do not lack any Evade I or Intercept skill. <br>
<br>
These classes were very straightforward and easy to analyze. Warriors are the strongest of these classes, with Armsman slightly underneath, and the Hero in last. At the each section includes a score. The scoring system does not analyze raw ability of each class as you might expect. If I were to take into account natural racial ability scores without regards to balance between realms, then Warriors would have 4.5 points, Armsman 4, and Heroes a 3.5. <br>
<br>
But, my scoring system takes into account that Midgard is designed to have the best races and weapon system for melee, Albion has the best armor and balance of melee/magic, and Hibernia is centered around magic specialization. Therefore, in relation to each other and with respect to what is expected of them in their realm, they are all perfectly balanced: <br>
<br>
Scores: <br>
ARMSMAN: 4 <br>
WARRIOR: 4 <br>
HERO: 4 <br>
<br>
<br>
*** PALADIN, THANE, CHAMPION *** <br>
<br>
PALADIN: Protect III, Parry, Intercept <br>
THANE: Protect II, Parry, Intercept <br>
CHAMPION: Protect II, Parry, Intercept <br>
<br>
PALADIN: Plate Mail, Large Shield <br>
THANE: Chain Mail, Medium Shield <br>
CHAMPION: Scale Mail, Medium Shield <br>
<br>
Paladin Chants: <br>
Secondary Spells: 0 <br>
Specializaiton Mean: 5 <br>
Self AF buff, Group Heal 6.5 seconds, Group Add Damage, Group AF buff, Resurrection I <br>
<br>
Thane Stormcalling: <br>
Secondary Spells: 0 <br>
Specialization Mean: 6 <br>
Direct Damage, Instant Direct Damage, Self STR buff, Self Add Damage, Point Blank AE Damage, AE Damage Line <br>
<br>
Champion Valor: <br>
Secondary Spells: 0 <br>
Specialization Mean: 5 <br>
Direct Damage, STR debuff, DEX debuff, Slowness debuff, Snare <br>
<br>
Nonmagic abilities are almost the same across classes. Paladins have the superior equipment advantage, while Thanes have their natural better selection of melee races and melee 1h/2h weapon options, while Champions have no nonmagical benefits compared to the other realms (which is expected). <br>
<br>
As far as Magic goes, the Thane is downright devastating and has a powerful arsenal of Direct Damage and AE spells to chain with. The Paladin is more of a Tankish defender with a strong group support role and helpful group chants. Both classes can opt to solo orange cons at risk. <br>
<br>
The Champion hails from the most magical Realm, but has the least amount of magic. In addition, the multi debuff nature of the spells were nerfed after it was thought they were too strong and the Champion was easily soloing Oranges. It was found that the DEX component of the debuff was actually a bug that made it 10x more powerful, so that was fixed and Champions were doubly nerfed from something that was in the first place a bug. Soloing Oranges now is out of the question. <br>
<br>
The Paladin is balancing in every respect to the other classes and as a member of its realm, by not having the most powerful spells, yet have the best equipment (Plate and Large Shield). The Champion is expected to have the worst nonmagical components to this class in relation to the other realms. If it did have the strongest magic like it was suppose to, then it would get a balanced score of 4. However, because it does not have the strongest magic out of its partner class and it has the weakest magic of all of them, they get a score of 3. <br>
<br>
The Thane is both the best in Melee attack and Damage output in every respect, with the largest arsenal of spells for being the “Melee strong at the cost of Magic” realm. The Thane is not unbalancing, but would revert to a score of 4 only after the Champion has superior spell capacity, so swings by the nerf bat are not necessary. <br>
<br>
PALADIN: 4 <br>
THANE: 4.5 <br>
CHAMPION: 3 <br>
<br>
<br>
*** MERCENARY, BERSERKER, BLADEMASTER *** <br>
<br>
MERCENARY: Protect III, Parry, Evade I, Intercept <br>
BERSERKER: Protect I, Parry, Evade III, Berserk IV <br>
BLADEMASTER: Protect III, Parry, Evade II, Intercept <br>
<br>
MERCENARY: Chain Mail, Medium Shield, Short Bow <br>
BERSERKER: Studded Leather, Small Shield <br>
BLADEMASTER: Reinforced Leather, Medium Shield, Short Bow <br>
<br>
Equipment-wise, Mercenaries of Albion are the best armed, with Blademaster in second and the Berserker in last. However the Berserker has the best Evade, with Blademaster in second, and Mercenary in last. They are overall balanced to each other in this respect. <br>
<br>
Berserkers are the only member of this class to have any special combat ability. They can increase their damage output for a while at the cost of their stamina. I do not have first hand experiences and this isn’t based on the raw comparisons, but I’ve heard that Thanes and Warriors still out damage Berserkers using that ability. <br>
<br>
Mercenaries and Blademasters have no special melee attack form whatsoever, and logs have been recorded where their melee/spellcasting tank outdamage them in pure melee by at least 30%. <br>
<br>
These classes are almost balanced with respect to each other, with Berserkers slightly ahead with the Berserk ability. However, none of them are balanced with respect to what their role is suppose to be in relation to their Realm, which can be summed up as a nonmagical high damage output tank with medium defense. The scores are lowered to reflect that: <br>
<br>
MERCENARY: 2 <br>
BERSERKER: 2.5 <br>
BLADEMASTER: 2 <br>
<br>
<br>
*** MINSTREL, SKALD, BARD, WARDEN *** <br>

MINSTREL: Evade II <br>
SKALD: Parry, Evade I, Protect II <br>
BARD: Evade III <br>
WARDEN: Parry <br>
<br>

<br>
Wardens at first seem out of place, but they share many traits with the Bard classes. In addition to 1.5x specialization, they have some combat abilities and some spell abilities, much like a blend of Skald and Bard. They share an issue that bards have which I will address later. <br>
<br>
Out of the bard classes, Minstrels and Skalds are best equipped, with Bards slightly behind. Upon specialization, Minstrels get access to 9 specialization spells, all of which are useful spells that we have become familiar to associate with Bard like classes. The rest of the Minstrels points can be spent in Stealth or Melee. Skalds get 7 specialization spells, with almost all except Snare as being very useful. <br>
<br>
Bards work very differently than the other bard classes and function almost like a spellcaster. They get access to 8 secondary spell lines just through leveling, with Mesmerize, Amnesia, and Healing being the most useful of the bunch along with individual stat buffs. After that, the Bard gets 3 specialization spell lines and weaker access to 3 specialization spells. This allows them to live up to their realm comparative role as having more magical ability at the cost of melee. <br>
<br>
Wardens are the best equipped out of this class comparison. Also the Warden has access to 6 secondary spells without specialization. I’ve spoke with different Wardens, and some opt to forgo any kind of melee specialization and spend it on both of their spell specialization options. Soloing is possible if the Warden specializes in Nurture and melee skills. Their damage output in pure melee is less than a tank and almost like that of a bard type with a weapon skill, but head on they would lose to a pure or hybrid tank. They are also have a group support role as buffer and healer. Wardens are balanced with respect to other classes in general, and as having a role in their realm. <br>
<br>
The Albion Minstrel is well equipped, has the core bard spells that makes the class an important group supporter, but faces the problem of weapon and instrument swapping. This hindrance alone is enough to set back the Minstrel as slightly under par, with 3.5 points. <br>
<br>
Skalds come from Midgard, so they are expected to be better at melee and to have less spell ability. This holds true for the most part, except they do not have that much of a melee advantage overall (except that they don’t have to swap instruments). I would recommend bumping Evade to II or allowing Medium Shield and a base for Shield Specialization so they get an additional 5% bonus, even without putting any points into it, after all they do come from the way of the Viking. Until they get a melee enhancement that represents their realm, I score them at 3.5. <br>
<br>
The Bard of Hibernia lives up to its role as being the most magical of all the Bards at the cost of melee altogether. They often have to swap multiple instruments and almost never engage in melee. It is however problematic having a host of secondary spells, while the best Bard spells are separated by different specialization areas, whereas the other bards have a single area of specialization. On paper, it looks powerful, but in reality Bards are making a melee sacrifice that the other two realm bards do not have to make. Altogether though, they have it slightly better than their bard counterparts, and are balanced with respect to their realm role. <br>
<br>
MINSTREL: 3 <br>
SKALD: 3 <br>
BARD: 3.5 <br>
WARDEN: 4 <br>

<br>
I’m going to keep this section short since Archers have been looked at in depth a lot and there are still more nerfs going on along with promised future enhancements (tracking, shapeshifting Hunters). I’ll sum up differences in brief: <br>
<br>
The Scout has the best nonmagical abilities and has the best bow by two paces, however they lack any magic, so their points are diverted towards melee after Stealth and Longbow. <br>
<br>
The Hunter has a combination of Self Buffs and Pet Spells, making them somewhat of an enhanced archer, but the pet is almost useless and neglected for PVP purposes. <br>
<br>
The Ranger is the ultimate self buff enhancing archer of the 3 and are the most capable in PVP. When it comes to Archer VS Archer though, it often does not matter which class you are, it’s all about who detects who first. <br>
<br>
As was stated by Sanya, all the archers were unfinished in beta and they got a damage bonus to compensate for that, which was overlooked up until this point. It’s Nerf effect has yet to be seen and is being tested on Pendragon. Until then, I’m scoring them with the current archer damage bonus in tact pre-nerf. PVE however, all the archers are more balanced in that respect, but the current state of their PVP can’t be ignored: <br>
<br>
SCOUT: 4.5 <br>
HUNTER: 5.0 <br>
RANGER: 5.5 <br>
<br>
<br>
*** INFILTRATOR, SHADOWBLADE, NIGHTSHADE *** <br>
<br>
INFILTRATOR: Evade VII, Stealth, Critical Strike, Envenom <br>
SHADOWBLADE: Evade VII, Stealth, Critical Strike, Envenom <br>
NIGHTSHADE: Evade VII, Stealth, Critical Strike, Envenom <br>
<br>
INFILTRATOR: Leather, Small Shield, Crossbow <br>
SHADOWBLADE: Leather, Small Shield, Thrown Weapon <br>
NIGHTSHADE: Leather, Small Shield <br>
<br>
Infiltrator has no spell ability. <br>
Shadowblade has no spell ability (but has a power bar) <br>
<br>
Nightshade Spell: <br>
Secondary Spells: 1 <br>
Weak Direct Damage <br>
<br>
I posted a thorough analysis of the class at: <br>
vnboards.ign.com/message....c=19406566 <br>
<br>
The primary difference between the classes is the fact that the Nightshade gets a weak DD in place of a ranged weapon. Also worth noting is the Left Axe issue and lack of Thrusting weapons in Midgard. However, Shadowblades have found that 2hs weapons can perform “relatively” devastating backstabs (still week compared to tank styles), and they are the only of the Assassin classes to get to use 2-handed weapons. Also plaguing this class is the need for too many skills and not enough points. All the Assassins are on par with each other (which is a very low standard), but serve no role in their realms. <br>
<br>
INFILTRATOR: 1 <br>
SHADOWBLADE: 1 <br>
NIGHTSHADE: 1 <br>
<br>

*** CLERIC, HEALER, DRUID *** <br>

(Secondary) AF buff, STR buff, DEX buff, Heal, Greater Heal, Resurrect I, Self Add Damage, Stop Movement <br>
(Nurture) Haste buff, STR/CON buff, DEX/QUI buff <br>
(Regrowth) Cure Poison, Cure Disease, Major Heal, Greater IV, Resurrect IV, Instant Heal, Instant Group Heal <br>
(Nature) Summon Pet (3/4 Level), Damage Shield, DOT <br>
<br>
All of these healing classes are well equipped in general, with Albion winning slightly with a better shield. Clerics get the most secondary spells, and rank second in amount of average specialization spells acquired. The Healer ranks second in secondary spells, and gets the most benefit through specialization. Odd to note, the Druid who hails from the magical realm gets the least amount of secondary spells and the least benefit through specialization. <br>
<br>
Through specialization, Clerics and Healers can become masters of crowd control. The buffing specialization is almost useless for any of these classes. The Druid does not have any form of crowd control, but because it can spend specialization points for a pet, it grants them the option of soloing oranges, which is a cruel joke on Hibernia. Instead of focusing on Healing, many druids spend points on their pet and prefer to solo oranges, and have weaker RVR healing abilities. Hibernia groups are often dependent on Hibernia’s range of secondary healers (Warden, Bard, Mentalist) and Druids are always a welcome sight in any group. <br>
<br>
Clerics have two excellent options. They get the best healing line of spells which includes group healing. They have great spell selection through Smite that is on par with spellcasters, including Stun and Mesmerize. They get a half a point bonus in score because they have more spells and their spells are more powerful than the Druids in multiple respects. Healers have the best pacification ability with mez, instant mez, stun, instant stun, and AE mez (overkill?). Pretty powerful coming from the melee strong realm, so the final score reflects that. Druids get the shaft in magic and their score reflects that they come from the Magic realm but currently are the weakest in magic of these classes, but they get a small half a point bonus for having a pet that lets them solo. <br>
<br>

(Mentalism) Paralyze, Healing, Confusion <br>
<br>
Friars get Leather armor and Evade IV and can specialize in Staves and Parry. However, with 1.0x specialization points, they have to choose to spend most of their points in their relatively underpowered Buff or Healing specialization, or to take up Staves and Parry with only 1.0x points. A Friar that chooses to specialize in a spell might as well had rolled a Cleric and get superior spells. If the Friar should be compared to any class for balancing purposes, they should be compared to the Warden and get 1.5x points. At most, they are a weak fighter with secondary spell abilities and buffs. <br>
<br>
Sorcerers are the only class in this selection that cannot directly heal life without draining it, but have many similarities to the classes of the other realms in many respects. They get 9 secondary spells through leveling and would work well at crowd control, if it wasn’t for the way spells are resisted currently. Crowd Control works best when grouped and fighting grouped mobs, often they are higher level. All casters face this issue, even the Clerics and Healers of the previous section, however half of their job is also to heal, sorcerer primarily casts on monsters. <br>
<br>
Shamans get 9 secondary spells, however their specialization spells are some of the worst to select from. They do get access to regeneration spells through their healing specialization. Their other specializations aren’t plentiful enough in spell selection to make them worthwhile. <br>
<br>
Weaker than Sorcerers, yet hailing from the Magical Realm, Mentalist only get access to 6 secondary spells and are tied in the worst access to specialization spells. To top that off are the reports that some of the spells that Mentalists like Short Term Charm Humanoid and Paralyze are broken. They are one of the least played classes of Hibernia. <br>
<br>
Friars watered down healing spells and combat potential reminds me of Hibernia’s Warden who gets 1.5x specialization and fills its role nicely there. Until then, Frairs remain underpowered and are not able to fully support their realm. Sorcerers are better off than Mentalist in a few respects, but fall short of being a vital realm member. Shamans are best off specializing in Healing for Regeneration abilities, but even then they are not that enhancing and are short term. The other Spell lines to specialize in are terrible, the secondary spells are the best choice. The Mentalist is broken, smallest spell selection, and has broken spells, yet comes from Hibernia, giving it the lowest score possible. All these classes need to be reworked. <br>

All these classes face the same spell resist issues that plague all spellcasters against slightly higher level mobs. The difference is that almost all of these caster spells are cast on monsters and not allies. Also, despite specialization, the damage benefits through specialization is minimal and the selection is small for the most part. <br>
<br>
Wizards get a small but fair access to secondary spells, with very little benefits through specialization. They do have the benefit of having the most Intelligent race, Avalonians, and they do not need to be the magically strongest since they hail from Albion. They get a 2. <br>
<br>
Runemasters have a host of Secondary spells to choose from, and more variety in spell selection (even a group enhance speed) and better spells through specialization (Like the Single Damage Absorb Shield). Runemasters are superior in every respect to Wizards and Eldritchs, even having higher damage spells that cost less mana, all this coming from the least Magical specialized realm. For that reason, Runemasters get a bonus point, but also get deducted for having the same resist issues that all casters face. No Nerf bat needs to be swung, but rather the other classes need serious revamping a notch above the Runemaster. Until the classes are revamped, Runemaster stays slightly above the balance standard with a score of 4.5. <br>
<br>
Eldritches, where do I begin? They have the same small and poor selection of spells as do Wizards, specialization doesn’t mean much, the Elf is the second strongest spellcaster race, and all this coming from Hibernia and what is suppose to be the most damaging spellcaster class in all of Camelot. Fix me? <br>

I have the least experience with pet classes so I will let others come up with conclusions for the most part. From everything I’ve heard and analyzing all their spells and ability to solo and having a role in their realm in general, I score them as follows: <br>
<br>
THEURGIST: 4 <br>
CABALIST: 3.5 <br>
SPIRITMASTER: 3.5 <br>
ENCHANTER: 3 <br>
<br>
