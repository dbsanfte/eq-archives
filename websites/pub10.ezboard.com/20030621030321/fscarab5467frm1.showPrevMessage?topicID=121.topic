Open bidding: All members interested post their bids in the raidchannel until one puts the highest bid and wins the item.<br>
<br>
Hidden bidding: All members interested in a particular item send one bid to the ML/RL who then determines the highest bid. Points are not announced publically.<br>

I read and acknowledged the weaknesses with this, so perhaps I should explain.<br>
<br>
As I see it there quite a few advantages for closed bids:<br>
<br>
1. It is much much faster to implement. Of all those voting, how many of you have actually had to handle the bidding? How much longer do you think it will take when people can keep on incrementing their bids until they run out of RP? <br>
<br>
2. Open bidding can lead to aggravation, people pumping up prices and all sort of other related issues where one person is constantly having to raise their bid due to someone else, and then perhaps trying to get revenge later.<br>
<br>
3. As people get more points bids may keep escalating more and more out of control.<br>
<br>
4. If someone is keen to get an item, with a closed bid they can make an initial high bid and the whole thing is over and done quickly. It stops people messing about trying to get items for the least amount of points they possibly can. Those who really want an item, get it. <br>
<br>
5. With open bidding extemely valuable items may be obtained for just 1RP, just because they are lucky and nobody else on the raid qualified to loot it. With closed bidding they are more likely to bid a realistic amount, unless they are closely aware of how many others want.<br>
<br>
6. Open bidding severely discriminates against classes that are then in large numbers - e.g.  in Kael we had 2 chain users and about 12 silk users. With open bidding the 2 chain users could get almost every item for 2RP where the silk users might be outbidding each other and paying significantly more.<br>
<br>
My strongest objection is to the time and effort taken to sort out loot with open bids. I was asked to stop the pulls as it was, just so we could sort out loot. I chose not to, I wanted to keep everyone busy and get more drops <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  With open bidding, that might become necessary. It probably takes a few minutes for every drop with open bidding, we had about 10 drops, so that's about half an hour of a 4 hour raid wasted.<br>
<br>
So please, think twice about this. Don't just vote for open bidding because that way you'll get loot for the minimum number of points you can. Think about the people organising the raid and the looting. Think about the time taken, the effort and stress involved.<br>
<br>
Vote for closed bidding! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bscarab5467.showUserPublicProfile?gid=runemoon>Runemoon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(12/3/02 4:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fscarab5467frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=56.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Open or hidden bidding during loot auctions?</span><hr size=1> An honest opinion, from an honest Cleric.<br>

 I say vote for open bidding. Nothing hidden, no one can make accusations that any deals have been done.<br>

However, I wouldn't want to be the poor ***** who has to administer this in a raid. We will need to find a way to make this work in a 'live' situation. <br>

Just an afterthought.. If I've earned my points, I will make them work for me, much as it may frustrate the person administering the auction, Im afraid.  <p>Runemoon<br>

<br>
I think that closed bidding, with the points being announced at the end of the raid or at the end of the bid working fine.  It makes it the bidding independedent and people are only going to bid what they believe the subjective value to them will be.  Therefore, although I voted for open bidding, because I like the open information, I prefer closed bidding (i.e. one bid, then announcing openly).  <br>
<br>
If I bid 10 points and Halice only bid 3 points, then basically I'm stating the value of that item to me, independent of anyone else.  I am saying that the item is so important to me that it's worth 5 raids worth of time to get that time.  Therefore it is not unfair for someone to outbid others by a large amout because the value of the item is subjective (i.e. different for different people)<br>

<br>
My first point is that the auctioneer can not bid for items, without compromising his/her integrity. Even bidding ALL your points for an item will allow someone to call foul. <br>
---------------------<br>
For example; in a closed auction system;<br>
<br>
Auctioneer_001 wants Uber_Item, therefore he decides to bid 18 of the 20 total points he has. <br>
<br>
In the ensuing bidding Scarab_002 bids all 19 points she has.<br>
<br>
It can be seen that Auctioneer_001 can easily exploit the situation in a closed auction, with a simple modification of his bid.<br>
----------------------------<br>
My second point, regards &quot;You have to get someone else to handle those particular items for you&quot; if you want said items as auctioneer.<br>
<br>
What happens when everyone wants the item? This could happen with some of the  POP loot.<br>
How long is this going to take when auctioneers have to be rotated several times (or more)? <br>
Mistakes are going to happen, bids forgotten, sending tells to the wrong auctioneer. People will get upset..ad nausem..<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
Last point...Much of the strife that kills guilds and causes bad feeling is over the division of loot. Don't let it happen to Scarab, we have something good going here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Runemoon<br>

In response to Rune's objection about everyone wanting an item - I really don't see this happening much, how many items are really of equal benefit to everyone? If it does, then whoever is running the bids would have to pass, its the only truly fair way. I can't think of one drop we've had yet where that would apply though.<br>
<br>
I still think the advantages of closed bidding vs open far outweigh the disadvantages. However, given that not everyone feels the same way, perhaps we should just let the raid leaders choose? They can announce open or closed bidding in the signup, so anyone not happy doesn't have to come along. Then after a while, perhaps it will become clearer which system works best and we can look at making one the official standard.<br>

<br>
I think boldir is spot on. It comes down to how much you value the item, not how many points you've got. This is probably the best way of doing it.<br>
<br>
So I switch my vote from Open to Closed, but I cant change the graph.<br>
<br>
I think for the moment the RL should say which method they will be using at the start of the raid. (and on the raid sign up) That way people who don't like open/closed know how the loot will be divided.<br>
<br>
Don't forget that if you really want an item and bid all your points if no other person bids against you, then it only costs you minimum bid. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=7003" target="_blank">

<br>
I would say closed.  I have no problem with open bidding, but in this case, it's pretty easy to be, excuse my language, a dick.  I watched it happen the other day, when a person kept bidding on the Silk BP that dropped even though he didn't want it all that bad.  Once he reached as high as he could go, finally he let the other guy have it.  Yeah, this could have backfired easily, but there was really no reason to keep bidding when it was obvious that he didn't need or want the item to begin with.<br>
<br>
Anyways, my point is the same that Deslok made.  It will force people to bid with as many points as they feel they think that the item is worth to them, and not against how many points the other bidder has.  Of course, being able to keep track of how many points you have at the time of the raid will help significantly in determining how many points it would be wise to bid with.<br>

One reason, to maintain trust. <br>
<br>
With an open system there can be no accusations of foul play. Take an example. A scarab member is after a specific item although the raid isnt specifically for that. The RL is a friend or fellow guild member of the person wanting that item. It would be easy to fiddle the points bid in a closed system to suit the 'friend' as follows - <br>
<br>
1. By elevating the friends bid to ensure he won it <br>
2. Using tells as 'whispers' to inform of current bidding<br>
3. to reduce points to prevent wastage but still win e.g. bidding 6 points when 3 would have won so RL announces the win was 'friend' with 3 points thus saving the friend from losing those extra points.<br>
<br>
Even the slightest hint of dishonesty can screw things up (and hurt more than a little too - especially if they are without proof). The accused individual(s) then have one helluva struggle to gain the trust back - should they want to.  <p>Take care,<br>

I can see where you're coming from.  But from what I've experienced of ML'ers so far is that they value fairness above everything else.  If SCARAB behaves in any other way it'll lose the integrity that has been built up over this time and people will not go on raids.  So eventually the RL's would be making a rod for their own backs.  I can't see that happening in all honesty.  But you're right that it should be considered, but I'm not sure how it can be detected (apart from noticing an ML continually winning uber loot by 1 point....)<br>

What do you think: all people interested in an item send a tell to ML with the amount of points they are willing to spend - just like in Ebay the one with the highest bid wins but only the points necessary to win are actually used. This would prevent the unnecessary loss of points but still makes sure people are going to bid as much as they think the items is worth for them.<br>
Example: A bids 4 points<br>
             B bids 10 points<br>
<br>
             Player B wins the item at the cost of 6 points (if we are going to bid in steps of 2 points).<br>
So player B stated that the item would be worth 10 points for him but if no-one else is going to bid that high he still gets it at a reasonable point-price ...which would reduce the disadvantage compared to people who are just lucky to be the only ones on a raid who want a specific item and get it for the minimum bid of 2 points. <p>Lildariel Silberwolf<br> Woodelf Hierophant 60th season<br> Officer of Heroes of Kaladim</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bscarab5467.showUserPublicProfile?gid=llador@scarab5467>Llador</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(12/6/02 11:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fscarab5467frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=56.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Open or hidden bidding during loot auctions?</span><hr size=1> Boldir:<br>

I agree and I trust all I have had the good fortune to raid with. However, Karo's post elsewhere that he was accused of greed made me feel VERY disappointed (putting it mildly) as I have come to know him as a generous, valued and trusted friend.<br>
<br>
It is precisely because of this kind of comment that I believe an open system is necessary. A misguided comment MAY be tolerable but as the saying goes, mud sticks. I commend Karo by immediately responding with an open post to try and resolve the matter (and prevent further such comments being made to anyone in such a position). <br>
<br>
Lild, <br>
<br>
I see where you are coming from but I'm not sure what is to be gained over an open system. With 11 points atm if I wanted to be sure of an item using your method, I could just bid the max points I have knowing it would be unlikely to cost me that much. The good side is that it would speed the looting up by making bidding quicker <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The closed system creates problems for the ML and prolongs the dishing of the loot. <br>
<br>
It is also difficult to remember what was looted so perhaps another suggestion. ( I'm not familiar with the PoP raid facility as yet so not sure if loot is trackable there).<br>
<br>
At the time to distribute/auction loot the ML (or whoever) creates 2 seperate channels named raidloot and raidauction. The ML then link lists (numbered consecutively) all items that have been collected to the raidloot channel. Players are then advised to open two new windows, one for each of the new channels. This does 2 things. <br>
<br>
Firstly it allows all to see what is available and thus decide on which item(s) they will spend their points on. There is nothing more fustrating than missing a drop at the time and realising it later when you dont have the points to bid on it.<br>
<br>
Secondly it also lets people know roughly how long they have to wait. Players sometimes have to leave and it would be nice to have an idea what was looted which gives them the choice to stay or leave earlier.<br>
<br>
The ML then announces in the raidauction channel which item bids are being taken on. Bidding then takes place in that same channel for that item until it is claimed or otherwise. <br>
<br>
The open system gives players the choice to decide how much to spend. The closed system is at best a guessing game which will lead to ill feeling and lengthy loot distribution.<br>

<br>
boldir: &quot;It makes it the bidding independedent and people are only going to bid what they believe the subjective value to them will be.&quot;<br>
I think prices are never independent :-) IMO prices are always made in relation to a group of buyers (and they can change if the group is different). With the exception of uber items where one would automatically bid all points one has gathered there is no basis to decide how much points an item is worth. It is a different situation in open bidding where you can see what market value an item has and you can decide that you are willing to top it or not. <br>
I dont think open bidding will be too complicated because most of the time only very few people are interested in an item and they can do the bidding very quickly. But this is only a guess, maybe we can try it out 2 to 3 times and rediscuss it then? <br>
Another good point is, that - as with random - all can see when the bidding is over.  <br>

<br>
Excellent discussion, I must say, and a lot of valid points were brought forward. It appears it is yet another &quot;damned if you do, damned if you don't&quot; sort of choice ...<br>
<br>
Before I try to summarize the major points, I just want to clarify one thing that Llador mentioned (the &quot;greed&quot; issue). I do not want to mention any name here but it think it is very important to note that it was NOT a SCARAB member that came up with this, it was one of the many guests we had along (who was probably not familiar at all with SCARAB and the processes we were currently going through). <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Runemoon pointed out one very important thing that I find worth repeating: Most arguments and downfalls of guilds are caused by quarrels over loot in some way (I have seen two guilds go down because of that - one was trying to introduce a point system when the founders objected and finally left the guild). Loot and items is an important aspect of the game, it would be naive to deny that, and we need some rules to go by, but it is only one aspect of EQ. We should try to ensure that points and loot never cause too much dissention that SCARAB begins to suffer from it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I have been ML quite a few times now, and as much as I am happy when I win an item of value to me, I would never consider cheating for it or &quot;faking&quot; auctions for whatever reasons. Fairness is more important than any virtual item and the worst thing you can do is to abuse trust that cannot be regained. With a closed auctioning system, you need a ML that you can trust, but there are many people in SCARAB I would readily entrust with this task.<br>
<br>
But on to some facts now:<br>
<br>
At the end of the discussion, most people said that the bidding system should be left open for now and the raid leader should decide which one he wants to pick. When I originally thought about auctions, this was the first thing that came to my mind too as I am not one to pick a strict rule for every possible situation on a raid. Since this discussion proved to be more complex than I anticipated and most of those who spoke up feel the same way, I too would like to return to this regulation until we get a better idea of the right system for us.<br>
<br>
So we basically have two ways of handling auctions and the RL should state in the sign-up thread which one his ML will apply (some feedback from the ML after the raid would be great <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). I already thought about about creating a template for raids that RLs can use (should they choose to, it is not mandatory) that they can simply copy/paste and fill out.<br>
<br>
1. Open bidding:<br>
<br>
People interested in an item send the ML a tell. The ML will then list those interested in the channel and the bidding is opened. Bidding will continue until one member gives the highest bid.<br>
<br>
2. Closed bidding:<br>
<br>
People interested in an item send the ML a tell. The ML then lists the names along with the raid points and everybody interested places one(!) bid in a private tell to the ML. Highest wins, of course. If there is a draw, the people with the highest bids will get another chance to raise their bids in another private tell. If they refuse to offer higher bids, the item will be randomed between them.<br>
<br>
Is that ok with you or do you want to see these basic systems altered in some way? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
