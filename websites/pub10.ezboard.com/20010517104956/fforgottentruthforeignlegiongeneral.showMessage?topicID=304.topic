Coming out of the portal I appeared in the middle of a running battle. 3 people were fighting a whole heard of shadows and assorted monster trash. Spells were flying and even though none were aimed at me I took 2 hits! Down to half-health...I healed quickly and snapped off a few shots. All the while, the brave souls around me were falling. With the last one down I decided that my mission must take priority so I turned and made a hasty retreat. Crossing the 2 inlets leading to the North Dires land bridge, I paused to kill a few frags.

I should have seen the signs but in my excitement to reach AB I wasn't looking to closely. It started with my buff cycle. I burned out 2 golden scarabs in as many tries to start my level V buffs. No worries I thought ... I'll go for IV's. After buffing I noticed 2 blips on radar...2 frags side by side. Not one to pass up an opportunity, I took both down. The lack of shards on either one should have been my first sign ... the 3 gold wasps that spawned next should have been my second! Down to only 22 hitpoints out of 140 something, I was running for my life!! Burst of electricty flying past me to left and right! Golems growing from the very earth itself to bar my path! Packs of Tumerocks sending wave after wave of arrow winging towards me! Somehow, I survived. Down to 5 hitpoints, I finally found a spot where I could rest and heal. My buffs ran out as I caught my breath. Completley healed, I began a new buff cycle ... only to fizzle on the first try and burn out my last silver scarab!!! The Gods were having a grand jest at this Old Crow's expense! but, I was not going to give up! Throwing on all my jewlery, I was determined to press on. Putting arrow to string I took my first step...an awakened a Diamond golem in a shallow depression directly in front of me. I don't know why i did it, but I fired an arrow at the beast and then ran straight for him. My arrow found it's mark for only 3 points of damage, but the surprise of the arrow or the shock of me running at him must have thrown the golem off a bit as he just stode there as I zoomed past. A late blow was thrown my way but was way of the mark; the Strength Inept VI he threw next was right on! Running at a fast crawl pace with a Diamond Golem on my heals was not my idea of a fun day, but somehow I managed to elude the beast and took a seat to wait out the debuff. I was almost at the end of the landbridge and had evaded more critters than I had ever seen in all my runs. With the debuff gone I made ready to reach the end of the bridge and start my second leg. Following my plan, I started running through what appeared to be empty territory buut soon had a back of silver rats and several swarms of gold wasps on me. So far, I had managed to eveabe all their attacks and hit the end of the bridge. I turned south to the next ridge but the little beasts decided to pursue me. As i made the ridge I ran into a pack of Bone Lord skellies. With rats, wasps and skeelies all out for bllod I took the only avenue of escape available...I ducked into a nearby dungeon portal. I'm not sure what it is called but I think Dia has been here before. I am going to rest then head out on my second leg of this trip. after all...it can't get any worse ... right?!?!?!</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#2f2f4f><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Crow</FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Unregistered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>10/30/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>6:05:53 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=304.topic&index=6><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Reply</FONT></A></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">It got worse!</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">The ale here in Fort Teth is watered down!

Stupid me...I didn't look at the map and almost ran directly into a tumerock tower!! I corrected my mistake at the last second and veered further west to the tower I was searching for. Through packs of wasps, banderling strykers and enforcers I ran. I took debuff after debuff..later I would find 12 differant debuffs total..each with multiple layers..all V's and VI's! The last straw came when I ran into a pack of boneknights and took 2 hits from acid swords. I somehow managed to limp into my tower! I'm not sure how long I sat inside...but before my debuffs had elapsed I ran downstairs, hit the lifestone and ran for Fort Teth! I managed to dodge most of the critters and actually ran inot Teth at Full health. I'll lifestone as soon as my beer is gone and then take the Glendon Wods portal for some scarabs.

We were both hugh Terry O'Reilly fans and while Terry was a good hockey player ... he was a great enforcer! Yup, that boy could fight. And back in those days knowing how to use your enforcers was just as important as scoring goals. Just about every &quot;incident&quot; Terry was involved in would end with the same two things ... terry in the penalty box and the other guy bleeding all over the ice. Of course, terry met his match on occasion .. like the islander's Clark Gillies. Terry and Clark had some epic battles and after each, in his worse Italian accent, my Uncle would turn to me and say, &quot;Now that's a spicey meatball!' i know, it sounds stupid...but it was funny at the time and a ripoff of some commercial back then that i can't recall now. Pretty soon, the diehard hockey fans in our row would always say the same thing after a good terry punch-up ... &quot;Now that's a spicey meatball!&quot; Hahahah...I know...stupid. <br>
Well, Crow just logged back in Fort Teth's alehouse to continue his journey but found himself watching a hugh war! It seems some choad let an Umbris follow him into the tavern! Luckly, Crow logged out over the bar so I watch the fight unfold. Already there were more bodies than I could count littering the floor. Spells were flying, arrows fired and weapons swinging...but the shadow was winning. A lifemage was outside draining through the wall, but the umbris hit the guy through the wall with his fist and killed him with 2 shots! I was cheering for the umbris!! Some little unarmed guy ran in and went toe to toe but soon died. he came back 3 more times and meet the same fate each time. I was laughing my butt off as people ran in...took a hit or two and then ran screaming for the hills. Sadly, it soon ended with the arrival of 3 mages who quickly drained the shadow down to a shadow of his former self. get it...shadow of his former self? Hhahahaha Anway...with the death of the shadow I looked around the room and all i could think of was ... &quot;Now THAT was a spicey meatball!&quot; I'm going to sudway for a meatball snadwich..back in a few and then I'll continue Crow's run.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#2f2f4f><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ugharadin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gharadin</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>10/30/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>7:39:11 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=304.topic&index=8><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Reply</FONT></A></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: OK ... who let the umbris into the tavern?</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Terry O'Reilly and the &quot;Big Bad Bruins&quot;... those were the days!<br>

I MADE IT!!! hahahahah. Well, to finish the story...I was pinned down by 3 Extas Lugians. I waited for my debuffs to drop...re-buffed and then took a few shots at the lugies just for fun. needless to say i did not hit a single one of these 108 level giants. Turning SW I made my sprint to AB. I tried to follow the ridges as much as possible..but after Diamaond Golem number 3 showed up...I went down into the vallies and the swamps. When I came face to face with a Virindi and a few tusker slaves I knew I was gonna die. There were 2 bodies already littering the gorund...but somehow I dodged the worst of the spells...broke into the open and saw the buildings of AB on a small hilltop. Now...I'm gonna have a drink!!</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#6B8E23><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ugharadin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gharadin</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>10/31/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>1:01:57 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=304.topic&index=15><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Reply</FONT></A></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">WOOT!!!</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Congratulations, Crow!!!
