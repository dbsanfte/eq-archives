------------<br>
We assembled at the appointed time; Fort Sauvage's walls rising majestically around us as we greeted each other and broke into groups.  There were four teams made up of Forgotten Truth, Sacred Order, and Lions of Albion to take a Midgard fort and hold it as our own. We selected Blendrake Faste and excitedly awaited the arrival of the Albion Wizards.<br>
<br>
Finally, the wizards began their procession toward the portal pad.  Many of us stared in awe at the Wizard's regal purple robes as they shifted with each elegant stride.  These Wizards held immense power within the Realm and we were now in their presence.  Slowly they encircled us and began to utter words of power.  The air crackled and our skin tingled as the words coalesced into a magical sphere that engulfed us all.  And in a flash we were transformed into the enemy's frontier of Odin.<br>
<br>
Slightly disoriented we milled around the only safe haven for Albions in this forsaken land.  Tirak, from the Sacred Order, emerged as the leader of our strike team.  He led us bravely down the foreign roads of this land.  It was a godsend that men and women of his battle-hardened experience were among us for otherwise we would have surely gotten lost just reaching the first gate.  Especially since the esteemed leader, and typically lost, Krystl of Forgotten Truth had formed the team responsible for raising an Albion flag over Blendrake.<br>
<br>
In a slow and steady trot we unventfully arrived at Blendrake.  Other than the cold and hideous bestiary it was actually a pleasant trip.  Frau, Gila, and Nerise had typically come unprepared for such a journey and the cold erected our spirits as well as their poorly clad nipples.  Sykosis tried to offer them cloaks but Tavik slapped him upside the head.  (Tavik was later heard to mumble, &quot;That moron will be the death of us all.&quot;)<br>
<br>
Upon our arrival to Bledfaste we killed its guards and began lay siege.  While Nimitz began assembling the ram Dalth and the bumbling Sykosis scaled the walls to dispatch the archers inside.  The two assassins approached their victim hidden.  Dalth sprang into action with a surgical strike as Sykosis realized in horror that he had forgotten his training.  Frantically he struck with the first attack style he could remember from the academy: Garrote (as any competent assassin knows you ALWAYS strike with Perforrate Artery first...what a moron).<br>
<br>
Realizing his mistake, Sykosis began a quick retreat and attempted to jump over the fortress walls only to get himself stuck in a slot between the wood.  Turning around Dalth witnessed Sykosis' folly and could only shake his head and mutter, &quot;I can't believe that moron graduated from the academy.&quot;<br>
<br>
As expected Dalth, escaped gracefully down the wall and Sykosis died horribly in a dark recess where our pious forces could not recover his life force.  Unfortunately, Sykosis was also carrying a large load of wood needed to assemble the second ram.  Lady Guinevere was smiling upon us this day, however, and the Sacred Order/Lions of Albion alliance had enough wood for Nimitz to construct the second ram.<br>
<br>
As the competent forces continued their siege of Blendrake, Sykosis was summoned from death back to Cotswold.  Grateful for a second - ok, 1,462,192 - chance, Sykosis ran back to Fort Sauvage so he could rejoin our forces.  As he is wont to do he got lost shortly after arriving back in Odin and missed the entire battle.  This was probably a good thing since the combined might of Rajivan and Sykosis probably would have knocked over a wall and killed our brave warriors before they could raise the Albion flag.<br>
<br>
With Sykosis safely out of the picture Krystl was able to raise the flag of Albion and of the Forgotten Truth over our prize amongst much fanfare and celebration.  Sykosis was able to witness the sight after Wraile stumbled across Sykosis making snow angels and point direct him in the correct direction of Blendrake.  (Wraile was heard to mutter: “Thank God that moron isn’t in our guild.”).<br>
<br>
The story may have ended there except our brave and fearless forces decided to entrench themselves in Odin.  Tirak and Nimitz began the process of repairing the damage we had done and putting up additional fortifications.  Sykosis and Wraile were sent to scout Nottmore Faste for a potential raid.  Dalth was sent along to keep Sykosis from hurting himself.  (Dalth was heard to mutter several times during the mission: &quot;If I kill him out in these woods we still have a chance to succeed.&quot;)<br>
<br>
The three scouts eventually uncovered a team of Migard's gathering at Nottmore Faste and alerted our main force.  Although the Midgard horde wasn't large it outnumbered our team considerably.  They also had the advantage of greater battle experience.  Quickly our talented scouts and Sykosis ran back to begin our defense of Blendrake and watch the expected death of Rajivan.<br>
<br>
When the scouts returned silence hung over our fort as we awaited the coming assault.  And still nothing happened.  In an act pure bravery Janelle, a minstrel of the Sacred Order, sprinted out to locate the Midgards and hopefully lead them into the teeth of our defenses.  Alas, she was lost in the snow of the Jamtland Mountains to a horde of evil Trolls.  Unable to let such an asset to the Albion lands be lost, Lady Guinevere recalled our heroine back to Albion’s and life’s warm embrace.<br>
<br>
As the Midgard force arrived at our fort Rajivan and Magstar were playing hopscotch in front of the gate (Rajivan was part of the same graduating class as Sykosis and Magstar is Rajivan's understudy - a sure sign of doom).  Rajivan The Usually Dead managed to release a mesmerization spell before meeting his grizzly end.  This probably ensured the survival of our forces for at least another 5 - 10 minutes (Rajivan's death, not the mesmerization).  The remaining forces attempted to slay as many of the Midgard horde as possible before retreating to the Lord Room for our final defense.<br>
<br>
Although greatly out-numbered our heroes fought valiantly and delayed the horde's onslaught.  As expected the final battle occurred in the Lord's room where a few final enemies were killed before all the Albion forces met their demise.  In recognition of our honor, and pity for Sykosis and Rajivan, Lady Guinevere recalled us once again to our Albion homeland (thus giving Sykosis his 1,462,193 chance).<br>
<br>
And so ends the story of valiant heroes, evil hordes of Midgard, and the folly of Rajivan and Sykosis!<br>
