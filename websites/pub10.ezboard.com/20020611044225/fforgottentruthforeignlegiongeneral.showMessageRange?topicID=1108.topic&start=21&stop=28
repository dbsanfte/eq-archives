Seems to argue you put your least used skills higher in the food chain because they get more bonuses to advance. Athletics should arguably be nothing but a misc skill regardless of build due to its heavy use and native propensity to advance. GAH! Another reroll.<br>

Primary stats are endurance and stength(I think)<br>

I chose the Lover for agility<br>

So my stats are all in the 40s and 50's , Agil being the highest at 55 and int/will at 50 others at 40 I think. Pretty balanced.<br>

<br>
Conjure/Mysticism, Security, LongBlade, Medium Armor<br>

MInors<br>
<br>
Sneak, Athletics, Destruction, Marksman, Speechcraft<br>
<br>
My magic skills and Alch and Ench in Misc are all  in the 10-15 range.  I think Restoration is at 20.<br>
<br>
I chose Longblade instead of Shortblade for the Strength factor.  I can increase strength as my levels go up by X2 or X3.  <br>
<br>
Medium Armor instead of Light for the same reason(endurance) <br>
 <br>
Athletics for Speed(dont need light armor to increase speed) in minor, which should go up fairly easily since your always using it. <br>
<br>
Destruction and Mysticicm for Willpower<br>
<br>
Conjure and Security for Intelligence. <br>
<br>
 Marksman and Sneak for Agility.<br>
<br>
I can keep it pretty balanced--am level 4 now but I need to work on more concentation before I level again.  Having 4 stats X2.  Would rather have 3 stats with +3 or something like that.<br>

<br>
I like the Mysticim for the Mark/Recall aspect and I wanted Conjure just for fun.  I had them as Major and they started with 35 or 40, I cant remember but the point is at 35 most spells I have bought or use are very close to 100% succesful.  I have noticed as you skill increases in restoraton my chance to succeed on casting increases.  So why not have some of these skills as Misc, raise them to the max when you buy the low end skill raise spells and not use them on major/minor.  while it is a slower progression I dont see where this will hurt you unless you are creating a spell with 100% invisibilty for 3 minutes type and you need a very high skill level in Illusion.  But you can get around that by just raising Misc skill Illsuion to 100 right?  So most magic seems to be a Misc skill in this regard as it costs nothing to raise (just alot of resting) and it doesnt count towards you gaing a level. Which means you can use more combat and Sneak skills are major/minors and level according to those skills that are harder to raise and since they are major/minor they raise faster and start higher.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PART 2<br>
<br>
with my character I was hoping to have every attribute (str, end, int) represented in my major/minor.  I did this to increase the way I received X2 or x5 to stats when ya level.  As it was turning out I was gettingg 4 skills with a X2 .  I could only use 3 so I got a total of 6 points to my attribures.  I want more!  I made it to where I was getting 3 stats with all X2 but that wasnt what I wanted,  I am not positive but this guy/gal seems to have figured it out.  I might have to try this out with the current character or I might be back at creation.  I plan to remake a character using both the strategies mentioned in this post(Part1 and 2).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It seems to me that the only way to even come close to hobbling your character in the long run is to follow the advice given here, i.e. make primary skills of all your favorites. Due to the way the advancement system works, this will yield a character who levels really quickly, but gains little benefit from leveling. The multiplier you get to add to your attributes is based on how many points you've gained out of all of your skills (including misc). To get the max bonus (3*5=15 attribute points), you'll need to get 10 skill points each in skills controlled by 3 different attributes, a total of 30 skill points. If all of your points are being accumulated in Major/Minor skills, you will come nowhere near to this, as 10 points will get you a level. Say you were to gain 4 points in heavy, 3 points in blade, and 3 points in destruction. Congrats you just made a quick level, very nice. Problem is, you get a 2x on Wil, a 2X on Str, and a 2X on End. This is a total of 6 points, 40% of the max you could get. 10 levels later, your stats have gone up 60 points, while a better build has gotten anywhere from 120-150 depending on how exacting they've been. <br>
<br>
Especially considering the huge impact End has on your hitpoints gained per level (and the bonus sure isn't retroactive), you're far better off placing your favorite skills as misc skills so you can advance them consistently to maximize stat gain without leveling up too quickly. Remember that the monsters level up with you (I believe the mechanism for this is their diseases. You've noticed that a rat with black-heart blight hits like a $#@$#'n hammer?), there's nothing to be gained by pumping your level, and a whole lot of attribute points to lose. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/udunkar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dunkar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(5/13/02 1:06:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1108.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Morrowind</span><hr size=1> Well, finally get through the initial stages of testing the game out and think I have settled on a created class I like.  Went with a Breton due to some of their starting bonus points (altho the Dark Elf was tempting).<br>
<br>
Intel and Willpower for starters, with Mage specialty<br>
<br>
Med Armor, Long Blade, Mysticism, Illusion, Speechcraft are my major skills, Destruction, Security, Acrobatics, Alchemy, Enchant are minor.<br>
<br>
Only problem I have run into on this template is my low health and Str.  Think I started with 30 health and 150 Str, not good for fights and hauling the loot.  Thinking more of a caster as his path, with some fighting/thief skills.  <br>
<br>
I am alright in a straight fight, if I get a chance to cast before entering melee I tend to win easily (love my 10 sec paralyze spell).  Once I hit lvl 3, I went back to the starting city and farmed the luminous and violet mushrooms and made potion after potion.  Think I raised Alchemy 8 points and made 400 drakes from selling the potions.  Easy many while increasing one of the minor skills.<br>
<br>
For those posting their expiriences her,e thanks for the pointers.  Hope the alchemy bit helps some in return.<br>

Sneak is at 75+, Short Blade 80, Security 90, Destruction 80, Acrobat 85.<br>
<br>
With items Strength, Intelligence and Agility are all over 100.<br>
<br>
Beat the Archmage in a duel last night so the new one would be me. Man, he had nice stuff. Almost the Master Thief as well, maybe tonight...<br>
<br>
Got a whole set of glass armor courtesy of the 5 finger discount with duplicate pieces stashed away in case the theft ever catches up with me. Got an Ebony Short Sword that hits like a freight train. Make friends with the Khajit in Pelagiad. She knows some things that are very useful and will test your thieving abilities sorely. There are some Robin Hood-ish quests from the Master Thief in Vivec that are kind of fun.<br>
<br>
Picked up a matched set of plate gauntlets with a permanent effect of +20 STR on one and +20 Agil on the other. They nicely complement the Robe worth 40g (?!!?) I found. Fits over armor nicely and has a permanent effect of Regen Stamina and Regen Health +15 each. Can run full speed while jumping and it never hardly moves the bar.<br>
<br>
Stealth is awesome at higher levels. I was dispatching heavily armored opponents easily if I could get the drop on them. Most fights went something like this:<br>
