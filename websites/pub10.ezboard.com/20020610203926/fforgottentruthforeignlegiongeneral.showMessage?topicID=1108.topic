It's got a bit of a learning curve, but anything this open ended pretty much has to. I played about 5 hours last night and I'm STILL not level 2.<br><br>In a nutshell:<br><br>Take Daggerfall, update graphics, throw out all the crappy randomly generated dungeons replacing them with hand crafted ones and get rid of the hourly crashes and you've got Morrowind.<br><br>It offers pretty much complete freedom in character generation, via 3 methods: The ol' Ultima &quot;Moral choices = your char class personality survey&quot;, just plain old pick your class or design your own class from scratch. Designing your own class is a nice option and I can't think of a character template you couldn't make this way. You also pick an astrological sign, which allots you certain abilities and sometimes certain weaknesses.<br><br>I started off as a Dark Elf Assassin/Caster hybrid (I forget the actual name) and did very well and did even better once I finished reading the manual. Being able to sneak helps a thief out a lot. (No charge for that tip) Backstabbing is a piece of cake provided you're a good sneaker and offers 4x damage, which amounts to a 1 shot in many cases. Did I mention there's LOTS of stuff to steal and LOTS of people to steal from? <br><br>You're free morally as well and there are lots of instances that this aspect of the game crops up. You know me, a guy loses a family heirloom and I happen to have it then it's all his but if I find a bundle of tax money in the middle of nowhere...well, let's just say there's a better dressed assassin walking the streets.<br><br>I'm not too sure about the magic system yet, when I can hit with a damage spell it does good damage, but then nuking is not my forte. There are lots of utility spells, including mark and recall spells, various teleports, water walking, detect spells, etc. There are spells that you cast on a mob before you kill it that will trap it's soul as it exits it's body into a gem. The soul gem can then be used to make a magic item. The bigger the mob, the better the item. You can make and title your own spells, too.<br><br>Combat is pretty neat and does a lot of damage if you can get close, havent messed with Archery yet. <br><br>Started over as a tank just to see how the other side lives and got killed by a mage within 5 minutes. Seems I forgot that Dark Elves are partially immune to fire, whereas the Redguards, while excellent warrior stock, are not.<br><br>There are lots of guilds and factions to ally with or against and near as I can tell there's no reason why you can't be a member of the Thieves' guild and the mages guild. You advance in these organizations by raising skills and doing quests assigned by the guild.<br><br>Bad stuff: Being open ended, it can be extremely daunting. You're offered a few quests right to start with but you don't HAVE to go do those. I can see where the sheer size of the game could be intimidating to start. Also, the game world seems to be loaded into memory in sectors, so there are noticable pauses when you change sectors, with the pause varying between 1-5 seconds. It's not a big deal, but I should mention it.<br><br>For reference purposes I'm playing on an Athlon 1800+, 512m PC2100 mem, Geforce 3 64m. It runs fine for me and I'm hearing about people with p3-600s and 256m ram doing ok with it, albeit with options turned down. Hell, on MY setup I dont have all the options on full, so I think this game has the potential to stress the finest gaming rigs out there<br><br>$50 at Software, Etc. Got the $20 hint book too. I was looking more for a reference guide than a walkthrough, but the book is very interesting and is published by Bethesda as well. Quest walkthroughs by the guys who wrote the quest are pretty funny to read and it's apparent that this game was a labor of love by it's designers.<br><br>Now if it was multiplayer...... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6B8E23><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Lews</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(5/3/02 10:12:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1108.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Morrowind</span><hr size=1> Nice little tidbits Creepy.<br><br>Think the hint book is worth it?

I made a custom class too, a dark elf ranger-type. Long sword, bows, and stealth, with a little healing magic and alchemy. So far he seems like a lot of fun, but more importantly, he looks damn good! He's wearing a samurai-looking outfit of chitin and chain armor, and wielding a mean-looking dai-katana. I've been mostly playing in 1st person mode, but I keep having to switch to 3rd person just to admire myself. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br> <br>I really liked the fact that the first couple of quests I've done weren't the usual Fed-Ex deliveries. One nice touch was that at one point, the local shopkeeper wouldn't talk to me until I ditched some controlled substances I'd looted from the bodies of some recently deceased smugglers. Said he didn't want any trouble from the law!<br><br>I played around with alchemy a little last night, and it seems like a game in itself. Most of my attempts failed, but I'm not sure if it's because my skill is so low or if I had the ingredients wrong. I was able to make a couple of useful potions though, so now I spend more time looting plants for ingredients than I do questing and killing. <br><br>I had to play around with the video settings to get it running smooth on my 1GHz T-Bird with 512 RAM and GeForce3. With shadows off, AI distance near the bottom, and view distance near max, it's a little choppy in town, but other than that it's very smooth, and it looks gorgeous. The pixel-shaded water is amazing, the screenshots don't do it justice. One little tip: some people are saying that increasing the resolution doesn't really affect frame rate all that much, and may even make it run faster. I tried going up to 1152x864, and I couldn't see any slowdown from 1024x768.<br><br>I haven't had much luck getting into the official forums, Bethesda's servers must be swamped. There's a few good threads over on the Gone Gold forums, and RPGDot has a decent Morrowind forum as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6B8E23><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ucreepypete.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CreepyPete</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(5/4/02 11:31:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1108.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Morrowind</span><hr size=1> Stealth is a little bit luck and a little bit technique. I spent about 40 mins messing with it in a Lord's house for a Thieves' Guild quest (right before I started a custom redguard knight <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br><br>Make sure no one can see you when you turn stealth on. It won't go on if someone is watching you or looking your direction. If you wait long enough behind cover (even something stupid like a pillar 5 feet away from the NPC) the NPCs begin to wander around and may turn their backs. You can tell when they've no longer looking at you because you'll be able to stealth, even if you can't see 'em at the time you try. I think the problem I have with Backstabbing is I try to get too close. I'm not so hot at judging distance in the game right now.<br><br>Buy potions. Health, Cure Poison &amp; Disease &amp; water breathing if needed. The spell potions are of incredibly limited duration, so don't drink one if you're not ready to scoot at that exact moment. There are recall scrolls available pretty cheap as well, although at this point geography is not my strong suit.<br><br>Read every book you can find. You can even read 'em in shops and houses because you don't have to take em to read em. Some give skill increases.<br><br>Read a little more in the hint book last night, mainly about the different factions and what skills they value. Many quests have more than one solution. Sometimes the really obvious one (i.e. Get the key to a Lord's Manor by killing the guy who owns it) is not the best solution. You have to figure these out by yourself, so another good hint is to SAVE YOUR GAME. A lot and under different saves.  Just because they give you a quest doesn't mean you can do it at that time. Try it once and if it's way too hard scoot to another city and get quests from that factions' counterpart in the new city. Quests will keep just fine until you can do them. (Plus, after failing a couple of times it's very satifying to come back in 3-4 levels and do it, even if only for the &quot;How you like me now, bitch?&quot; factor. =)<br><br>I think the game is big enough. Once you start wandering around outside the towns the scenery changes drastically from region to region and it's really easy to get lost. I wouldn't want to walk across the Island, put it that way. I'm hearing there are a LOT of things underwater, so I'm considering building a custom lizardman char for exploration.<br><br>If you guys have questions I can answer via the hint book either post em here or email em to me and I'll get back to you ASAP. I dunno how close you have to be to Bethesda to get into their website (a block?) but it was working fine on Wednesday night. That's a good sign as this really deserves to be a blockbuster title for them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ucreepypete.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CreepyPete</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(5/5/02 12:20:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1108.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> More hints:</span><hr size=1> Read any book that costs around 150+.

So I did, and then used alchemy and enchant as minor skills.

Which means I will never get a x2 or x3 for those attributes.

In the first town(lighthouse) or any house I guess.  You hit sneak and stand behind them for a while and hopefull your sneak light goes on. It will go off as your skill is sucky. But then back on.  Soif you drop a small weight on your keyboard sneak key and walk away for 10 minutes or an hour ,(depending if it is major/minor/misc)  Wondering if would just be better to make it a Misc and let it sneak for a couple of hours?  That might be my next try. <br><br>ALCHEMY<br><br>I played around with this and then found a post with good info on it but I lost the link, I did save the message though. A mortar and pestle is available in the first town for 100gp ish.  I would buy it since you are usually stuck carrying all those herbs and stuff and the only other one I saw early in the game was a Master one which cost 2500ish.  The potions dont weigh much once you have created them. <br> <br><br>1. The first effect listed for a component is what you will endure if you EAT it. Munch on Marshmerrow or Resin for a quick heal, Void Salts or Deadra's Heart to Restore Magicka. <br><br>2. You buy and equip a Mortar and Pestal to mix 2 to 4 components. The quality of the Mortar and Pestal determines the base strength of the potion. The Mortar and Pestal is permanent.. buy it once.. use it often. So buy the best you can afford to begin with. <br><br>3. When combining 2 to 4 components, at least 2 of them must have matching effects to create a potion. When 2 components share the same effect in any order, the resulting effect is listed in the Created Effects window. One component can have Restore Fatigue listed first and the other can have it listed third and it will still work. <br><br>Any components that don't contribute to the resulting effect are still consumed (ie. wasted) Use the Created Effects window to determine exactly what to combine. Only mix what will result in a desired potion. I know, sounds silly, but you've been warned. <br><br>4. The chance to successfully create a potion is based on your Alchemy skill. (A &quot;duh&quot; statement for those on their 3rd straight day of playing with no sleep) <br><br>5. Combining 3 components with the same effect, ie. Ampule Pod+Kwana Cuttle+Violet Corpious=Waterwalking, is the same as combining only 2 of the 3 components, except you lost that 3rd component. In this case, more does not mean better. Of course, you can combine 2, 3 or even 4 components if their combination results in several &quot;different&quot; desired effects. <br><br>6. Combining components with opposite effects will cancel each other out to some degree. Hyper Facia+Violet Corpious+Scrib Jerkey+Large Kwana Egg wil create a potion with both Drain Fatigue and Restore Fatigue. (why do so? who knows.. but you can) The Restore Fatigue &quot;amount over time&quot; total is greater than the Drain Fatigue &quot;amount over time&quot; total so your exhausted fatigue will still increase. Read the label before drinking (or rejecting) a strange concoction. <br><br>7. The extra Alchemy tools Retort (increases positive), Alembic (decreases negative) and Calinator (increases both) will modify the final ratio. <br><br><br>Will let ya know how the sneak Misc thing turns out.<br><br><br>Lews<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6B8E23><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/uwalbort.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Walbort</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(5/6/02 2:54:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1108.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Morrowind</span><hr size=1> My first attempt at creating a class seems not to have gone well.

As soon as I could I joined the Mage Guild to get access to their spellmaker. Then I made a spell that boosts my personality by 40 points for 3 seconds - just long enough to cast it and initiate a conversation. It saves me a few bucks when dealing with merchants, but more importantly, it makes provoking Bad People into fights much easier. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>I'm starting to think this is a pretty big game.

Having had a similar experience in high school, I was happy to help him handle his girl problems. Except, when I find her, she says she had to paralyze him because he kept trying to introduce her to a friend of his, which he referred to as &quot;Mr. Frisky.&quot; I have to say that I was not in the mood for any of this. This isn't Loveline, and I'm not Doctor @#%$ Drew. I'm a @#%$, six-and-a-half foot, bipedal tiger who thinks your whole species looks delicious. I stuck the both of them with my long sword, took the axe for myself, and chalked up two for sensible discourse between the sexes.

I don't know what it is about Morrowind that makes me a bad kitty, but I crave it now. The more I play it, like I said, the more the seams of the experience will start to show - I'll relate those here. But so far, the only problem I have with the game isn't something in there, it's something left out. After AC, AO, and DA, I get so lonely playing a game like this by myself. Now, this loneliness is something they've tried specifically to create in this game, because your character (regardless of how you construct it) isn't from there. But it's more than that. Like System Shock 2, no one character can possibly excel at every one of the rich careers - but they're so complimentary that you can't help but imagine a few paired classes raising hell. If I weren't enjoying the game so much, it wouldn't matter. It would be on and off my platter before the data had time to fragment. But when I have something this good, it is my natural instinct to share it. I just wish they would let me. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ucreepypete.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CreepyPete</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(5/8/02 10:33:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1108.topic&index=20>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Penny Arcade</span><hr size=1> The more I play the more I appreciate the Illusion school of magic for a rogue.
