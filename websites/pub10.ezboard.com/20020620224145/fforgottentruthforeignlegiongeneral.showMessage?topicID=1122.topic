Here's the full release notes to the version. Big <br>
items in 1.50 are the debut of the new Realm Ability system, graphics for <br>
the level 50 armors, some spell additions, and lots of tweaks and bug fixes. <br>
<br>
======================================= <br>
Dark Age of Camelot <br>
Version 1.50 Release Notes <br>
======================================= <br>
<br>
NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES <br>
<br>
- Class-specific items in backpacks can now be used by the class that they<br>
were intended for; other classes can not. <br>
<br>
- Enemy players should now longer be able to take control of siege <br>
equipment through a door. <br>
<br>
- If you're in combat mode and you sit down, you'll now exit out of combat<br>
 mode. <br>
<br>
- Really large experience awards should no longer print as negative numbers <br>
(even though the proper amount of experience was being awarded). <br>
<br>
- High-level poisons are now stripped from a weapon that is used by a lower <br>
level player. Previously the poison would not &quot;fire&quot;, and the poison would stay <br>
on the weapon indefinitely. <br>
<br>
- Chat groups will now support up to 50 players. <br>
<br>
- [/gc who alliance] will now show you everyone in the alliance, not just players <br>
in your guild. <br>
<br>
- Keep Lords and Guards will no longer warp to the roofs of keeps when <br>
fighting enemies. <br>
<br>
- You can no longer use charged items directly out of your inventory. <br>
<br>
- You can no longer &quot;pull&quot; players via resurrection behind boundary walls or <br>
other illegal locations. <br>
<br>
- Pets will no longer attack mesmerized enemies if the pet is in defensive <br>
mode. If he is set to aggressive, he will still attack mezzed enemies. <br>
<br>
- Hibernian and Midgard &quot;in-game&quot; guilds now grant their members level <br>
titles - up until now, only Albion guilds had this feature. Please note that you <br>
may have to level your character once to see your title. <br>
<br>
- Midgard Warriors now are granted the Intercept ability at level 12. Any <br>
Warrior currently over level 11 will be converted and given the skill. <br>
<br>
REALM ABILITY SYSTEM <br>
<br>
The time has come to take the wraps off our new Realm Ability system. <br>
The purpose of this system is to give higher-level players new abilities that <br>
they can attain by engaging in RvR combat. A secondary benefit is to give <br>
classes more abilities that can help them during RvR battles - for example, <br>
one of the Realm Abilities open to melee classes is to gain an increased <br>
resistance to stun/mez spells. <br>
<br>
Please remember that there are Realm Ranks and Realm Levels. There are <br>
100 Realm levels, which are divided into 10 Realm Ranks. For the Realm <br>
Ability system, each player will receive one Realm Skill Point for each Realm <br>
Level attained - giving the player a maximum of about 100 points to spend <br>
on these new abilities. <br>
<br>
In order to &quot;spend&quot; Realm Ability Points on a skill, you'll go to your <br>
standard class trainer. The Realm Abilities available to your class will be listed <br>
there.  Please note that you do not have to have a high number of Realm <br>
Levels to be able to take advantage of these new abilities - in almost all <br>
cases, a character that has just a few realm levels can purchase at least a <br>
couple of new abilities. <br>
<br>
There are two types of realm abilities: Passive and Active. Passive realm <br>
abilities are always on, and can affect your character in small ways, <br>
generally 3% per level  (high levels of passive realm abilities grant <br>
substantial bonuses, however). Active abilities have re-use timers between <br>
5 and 30 minutes, and are either instant effects or duration effects lasting <br>
between 30 and 60 seconds. Each class has a list of abilities tailored to <br>
them, and each class has an ability unique to them. <br>
<br>
Some realm abilities have multiple levels, and each level will add more <br>
bonus. For example, the Augmented Strength realm ability awards 6 <br>
Strength points per level of the ability purchased, and there are five levels. <br>
So, in our example, a Level 3 Augmented Strength would give +18 <br>
Strength to a character. <br>
<br>
The costs for each level of ability, as well as the advanced abilities increase <br>
with the level you are trying to attain. Also, please note that some Realm <br>
Abilities have pre-requisites that must be purchased before you can buy <br>
them. Pre-requisite skills may have to be purchased to a given level before <br>
an advanced skill can be trained. <br>
<br>

<br>
AUDIO NOTES <br>
<br>
This version of Camelot has the first version of our new ambient sound <br>
system.  You'll notice while running around that you won't hear so much <br>
dead silence. This version is just the first step in the changes, though - <br>
so all you'll hear are non-interactive sounds such as birds, animals, wind, <br>
etc. All zones have had this sound upgrade, which includes both new day <br>
and night sounds. Please note that these new sounds are only in outdoor <br>
terrain zones. Cities and dungeons will be worked on next. <br>
<br>
COMBAT STYLE CHANGES <br>
<br>
These are the first of the Strike Team Combat Style changes, based on <br>
player, Team Lead, and in-house testing feedback. This are NOT the only <br>
changes that we will be making to combat styles; they are merely the <br>
first of the changes. <br>
<br>
- You will now be able to cancel a combat style after you activate it but <br>
before you swing by hitting the same style button again (i.e. hitting it <br>
once activates the style, hitting it again cancels it). <br>
<br>
- You can now be able to specify a &quot;backup&quot; style. This means you can <br>
activate, for example, an &quot;evade&quot; style, and as a backup, a no opening style. <br>
This means if your target attacks you again before you get your next style <br>
off and you DON'T evade, the game will use your backup style (the no opening <br>
one) instead. You choose the &quot;backup&quot; style by hitting the key for your <br>
primary, and then they key for the backup. Please note that once you specify <br>
a primary and a backup style, you cannot cancel them. <br>
<br>
- Please note that for both canceling and setting up a backup style that you <br>
don't have to keep repeatedly mashing the buttons to get a combat style off, <br>
even in low frame rate conditions. The game will buffer your command and <br>
send it, even if you are not getting good performance from your client. <br>
<br>
We are aware that hitting Shift-# key to switch toolbars does not work this <br>
<br>
- All Left Axe styles which grow in damage as you train further in left axe <br>
have the amount they grow doubled. This is to balance out the fact that left <br>
axe damage is cut in half (because two weapons hit every round). <br>
<br>
- Tracking Spear now uses Parry as an opening. <br>
<br>
- Wyvern's Bite now uses Dragonspider as its opening. <br>
<br>
- Evernight is now rear positional. <br>
<br>
- Valkyrie's Shield is now based on you blocking. <br>
<br>
- The opening for Defender's Rage now is whenever a combat style is used<br>
successfully on you. <br>
<br>
- &quot;Double Recovery&quot; as been changed to &quot;Onslaught&quot; and now is side positional. <br>
<br>
- Odin's Wrath now chains off Razor Edge. <br>
<br>
- Brilliant Blade now chains off Revenging Blade. <br>
<br>
- Prismatic Blade now chains off Dancing Blade. <br>
<br>
- Bludgeon has had its fatigue cost cut in half; its taunt is now 50% more <br>
effective, and it has a medium bonus to hit. <br>
<br>
- Decaying Rage's detaunt amount has been tripled. <br>
<br>
- Side Slicer is now correctly side positional. <br>
<br>
SAFE FALL FIX <br>
<br>
Those rogue-types who specialized up to level 50 in Stealth were not <br>
being awarded Safe Fall 5. This has been fixed, and all existing rogues <br>
with 50 stealth will now be given that skill. Additionally, future Rogues <br>
who level up to 50 in stealth will receive the skill properly. <br>
<br>
LEVEL 50 ARMOR GRAPHICS UPDATE <br>
<br>
We've added in the graphics for the level 50 armors. <br>
<br>
ITEM DISPLAY NOTES <br>
<br>
- On your character sheet, there are two values: WeapDam and <br>
ArmorFact.  WeapDam is representative of your weapon's damage <br>
per second. ArmorFact is the aggregate armor factor of each piece <br>
of armor weighted by the percent chance to hit the area where the <br>
armor is worn. Previously, ArmorFact took the quality of the piece <br>
into account - unfortunately WeapDam did not. It's now fixed such <br>
that the WeapDam printed on the character sheet takes the quality <br>
of the weapon and multiplies it into the DPS to get the effective dps <br>
of the weapon. Note that for most players, this factor will be reduced <br>
when they log into this new version (since it now multiplies by quality). <br>
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOUR WEAPONS HAS NOT BEEN REDUCED <br>
JUST BECAUSE THIS NUMBER IS LOWER. You can get information <br>
(shift-I) on the weapon to see that the base numbers have not <br>
changed - just the WeapDam value (which is a conglomeration of all <br>
the numbers) has. <br>
<br>
- More information has been added to the Shift-I Info window for <br>
weapons. You now see: <br>
Base DPS <br>
Clamped DPS <br>
Quality <br>
Condition <br>
Effective Damage <br>
<br>
Where the Effective Damage is the Clamped DPS multiplied by the Quality and<br>
Condition factors. <br>
 (3) More information has been added to the Shift-I Info window for armor. <br>
You now see: <br>
Base Factor <br>
Clamped Factor <br>
Absorption <br>
Quality <br>
Condition <br>
Effective Factor <br>
<br>
Where the Effective Factor is the Clamped Factor multiplied by the Quality <br>
and Condition factors and divided by the absorption. <br>
<br>
SPELL SYSTEM NOTES <br>
<br>
- We've gone through all the bug reports from the last spell graphics update, <br>
and have made many fixes. Some spells had no effects at all, some were <br>
displaying incorrect graphics, etc. <br>
<br>
- A new group heal spell line has been added to the Mending base spell list: <br>
<br>
15 Group Reparation <br>
25 Group Purification <br>
35 Group Restoration <br>
45 Group Emendation <br>
<br>
- Added new group heal spell line to Healer Mending spec track: <br>
<br>
15 Favor of Battle <br>
26 Boon of Battle <br>
36 Dispensation of Battle <br>
46 Tribute of Battle <br>
<br>
- Added new area-effect root line to the Shaman Cave spec: <br>
<br>
22 Vine Field <br>
31 Weed Field <br>
39 Creeper Field <br>
49 Tendril Field <br>
<br>
- Added point blank area-effect disease shout to Shaman Cave spec: <br>
27 Mold Cloud <br>
37 Mold Burst <br>
47 Mold Explosion <br>
<br>
- Resistances now affect the duration of debuffs, which include<br>
mez/root/snare/stun. Positive amounts in your bonus page will <br>
reduce the duration of debuffs *of that damage type* by the listed <br>
percent. Negative amounts will increase the duration of debuffs except <br>
for mesmerize, stun and root/snare. This means that mez/root/snare/stun <br>
duration will never be longer than they were previous to this update - <br>
but if you are resistant to a particular one, its duration will be shorter. <br>
These bonuses are cumulative with realm ability magical resistance. <br>
<br>
WORLD NOTES <br>
<br>
Trade Skills: all craft trainers will now give additional information to players <br>
just prior to joining a crafting guild. Information details what the player will <br>
be creating and how well the player can craft within the other crafting skills. <br>
<br>
Realm Portals: All portal stores will now indicate the names of battleground <br>
you will travel to during your later levels. <br>
<br>
Tradeskills: <br>
<br>
- The additional tradeskill areas in the three home cities should now host a<br>
merchant for each of the crafting skills. <br>
<br>
- Craft Trainers will no longer tell you &quot;Welcome to our order!&quot; when you <br>
have yet to join. Trainers will also correctly inform you if the craft is not <br>
available to your class. <br>
<br>
Hibernia World: <br>
<br>
Dungeon: Muire Tomb: One survivor of a grave-robbing expedition in <br>
Muire Tomb returned to Ardee, where he succumbed to madness. Before <br>
he became incoherent, he reported that his expedition had broken through <br>
the tomb walls in several locations, revealing new passageways which delve <br>
deeper into the ancient crypt than any records ever indicated. The skeletal <br>
remains of the Muire family dating back to even before Connaire have been <br>
found to be even more dangerous than the last known head of this powerful <br>
elven family. <br>
<br>
Lough Gur: The gurite waylayer hiding just a bit too well in the trees should <br>
now be targettable. <br>
<br>
Midgard Monsters: <br>
<br>
- The entrancing dirge should no longer be able to chain-cast a mesmerization <br>
spell while in melee combat. <br>
<br>
- The wayward fenrir scout in Raumarik has located his home camp to pull <br>
allies from. <br>
<br>
Albion Monsters: <br>
<br>
The Salisbury Giant should no longer be able to attack adventurers from a <br>
distance while the player is &quot;out of range&quot; for spell casting. <br>
<br>
Hibernia Monsters <br>
<br>
Cliffs of Moher: The Koalinth Sentinels guarding Koalinth Caverns taken <br>
new sentry posts away from the exit of the dungeon. <br>
<br>
Midgard Quests: <br>
<br>
New Quest: Thorgil, the farmer driven from his home outside Audliten, is <br>
still having problems with the tomtes. Thorgil is looking for those that helped <br>
him with the first problem to visit him again. Thorgil could use their help with <br>
the plot the tomtes have cooked up for Thorgil and Audliten. <br>
<br>
We have added two repeatable quests, similar to the Soul Gem and Fell <br>
Tooth Albion-based quests. These Midgard quests begin in Uppland, and <br>
there is a limit to the maximum number of times you can complete them. <br>
<br>
New Quest: Gudlor of Huginfell is worried about a dangerous book that is <br>
in his possession. Those that have helped Gudlor before should seek him <br>
out for he needs assistance. <br>
<br>
Hibernia Quests: <br>
<br>
New Quest: Mannix, in Mag Mell, swears he knows where adventurers <br>
can obtain some useful, enchanted items, for a small risk. <br>
<br>
New Quest: Gormghlaith, in Howth, is looking for people to collect water <br>
beetle carapaces for her home-made concoctions, but there seems to be <br>
more to her simple request for help than meets the eye. <br>
<br>
Hibernia Quests: We have added two repeatable quests, similar to the <br>
Soul Gem and Fell Tooth Albion-based quests. These Hibernian quests <br>
begin in or near Mt. Collory, and there is a limit to the maximum number <br>
of times you can complete them. <br>
<br>
Albion Quests: <br>
<br>
In our next patch, we will be adding a very high limit to the maximum <br>
number of times you can complete the following quests: Save the Spirits <br>
and Fell Creatures Bounty. If you want to guarantee that you can turn <br>
in any items you might have been saving for these quests, you should <br>
turn them in before the next patch. <br>
<br>
Albion Quests: Remember, in our next patch, we will be adding a limit to <br>
the maximum number of times you can complete the following quests: <br>
&quot;Soul Gem&quot; and &quot;Fell Tooth Bounty.&quot; If you want to guarantee that <br>
you can turn in any items you might have been saving for these quests, <br>
you should turn them in before the next patch. <br>
<br>
Realm v. Realm Notes <br>
<br>
- Frontier Keeps: It should be easier to target NPC archers at all frontier <br>
keeps, and particularly the hibernian frontier keeps. <br>
<br>
- The guild banners on Caer Hurybury and Blendrake Faste should now <br>
be working correctly. (Note: This fix was also made to live servers on 5/2/02) <br>
<br>
- The realm guards should be not quite so vigilant about shouting out at <br>
their enemies as they attack. <br>
<br>
OBJECT NOTES <br>
<br>
- Stiletto of the Soulshade (Albion) now properly uses thrust instead of slash. <br>
<br>
- The chewed staff had its incorrect resistence buff fixed. <br>
<br>
- The Spirit Bone Pin may now be worn. <br>
<br>
- The double Body resist entries for the Worn Jewel Dusted Robe are now a <br>
single entry. <br>
<br>
- The double Body resist entry for the Truesilver Flute has been fixed. <br>
<br>
- Supple Willow branches should stack properly. <br>
<br>
- Changed the +emp bonus on the Dancing Silk tunic (Midgard) to +pie <br>
<br>
- The Smoldering Ember staff (Albion) is now friar only. <br>
<br>
- The Gnawed Staff (Albion) should be displaying a proper resist. <br>
<br>
- The Brigadine Gloves of Vigilant Defense ( Scout quest armor) now correctly <br>
buff the longbow skill. <br>
<br>
- Baln's Sulfuric Slicer (Midgard version) correctly buffs sword instead of slash. <br>
<br>
- The Enraged Wolf Pelt Cloak should be emblemizable. <br>
<br>
- Avernal Maligned Staff of Mind, Accursed Demon Hammer, Accursed Demon<br>
Crusher, Accursed Demon Staff of Light, Accursed Demon Staff of <br>
Enchantment, and Accursed Demon Recurve Bow (Hibernia DF items) were <br>
all adjusted to be the appropriate level. <br>
<br>
- The new monsters for Muire Tomb are itemized, complete with new magical<br>
goodies to round out the existing equipment set in the zone. <br>
<br>
- Several common loot objects are now stackable that previously weren't. This<br>
includes necklaces, collars, chains, bracelets, bracers, armbands, bottles, <br>
different kinds of dust, essences, pins, and a few other assorted small items. <br>
<br>
- Salvage values based on the value of the object have been set on existing <br>
dropped armor and weapons. <br>
<br>
- Removed &quot;phantom proc&quot; from the Worn Dark Guardian Sword. <br>
<br>
- The stat bonuses on the Granny's Shawl were tuned to be more level <br>
appropriate. <br>
<br>
- Salvage values based on the value of the object has been set on <br>
existing quest armor and weapons. <br>
<br>
- The Cloak of Night can now take emblems. <br>
<br>
- The Emerald-beaded strand now has the correct icon. <br>
<br>
CRAFTING SYSTEM NOTES <br>
<br>
- Crafted items now have a minimum quality of 94 percent. There is now an<br>
even chance that any crafted item will have a quality of 94-99 percent, with <br>
a very small chance of 100 percent. <br>
<br>
- When you go up in level in a crafting skill, the print line will now tell you <br>
what your new level is. <br>
<br>
- Added in the ability for armorcrafters and tailors to make the &quot;level 6&quot; <br>
version of their various types of armor. This enables them, at the material <br>
10 level, make armor that is 51st level (versus the 50th level of dropped <br>
items and quest items).  This will enable tradeskillers to make the current <br>
highest possible base AF armors for their realms. <br>
<br>
- Timers for all of the recipes have been changed. This has a slight increase <br>
to the timers at the high end, but is about the same, if not lower, for the <br>
level 10 materials. You will notice a distinct drop in the timer for materials <br>
6-9. We changed the base equation that we used for the timers so <br>
everything was more uniform.  Weaponcrafters should notice a significant <br>
decrease in the *overall* time it takes to craft a weapon. They still take <br>
the most time to make a single item, but it isn't as artificially high as it was <br>
before. <br>
<br>
- To coincide with the addition of salvage values for almost every single item <br>
that is dropped or quested (see note at end), we also equalized the salvage <br>
values for crafted items as well. They were set too high before, and in some <br>
cases would allow a crafter to salvage enough material back to make a <br>

in and tries out today's patch, about how to determine how many realm ability <br>
points your characters now have: <br>
<br>
To determine how many Realm Skill Points you should have, take your Realm<br>
Rank multiplied by 10, and your realm level, and subtract 10. The &quot;subtract 10&quot; <br>
is what's not immediately obvious, because everyone starts from 0 at Realm <br>
Rank 1.  Thus, someone with Realm Rank 1 level 1 should have 1 realm skill <br>
point (1 x 10 + 1 - 10 = 1) and someone with Realm Rank 5 level 4 should <br>
have 44 realm skill points (5 x 10 + 4 - 10 = 44). <br>
<br>
It looks complex but it's really pretty simple once you remember that you get <br>
a &quot;free&quot; realm rank when you turn level 20 and are eligible for RvR. <br>
<br>
Thanks, and enjoy playing Dark Age of Camelot!<br>

Part H! See the story directly below this one for the whole story. <br>
<br>
======================================= <br>
Dark Age of Camelot <br>
Test Version 1.50H Release Notes <br>
Tuesday, May 7, 2002 <br>
======================================= <br>
<br>
Camelot 1.50 is scheduled to go live tomorrow morning at 8:00<br>
eastern time. <br>
<br>
<br>
MESMERIZE UPDATE <br>
<br>
As we are going live tomorrow, we've done our assessment of each skill and <br>
bug fix that we added to the version (based Pendragon tester feedback, as <br>
well as our internal testing). As part of this, we decided that the &quot;double nerf&quot; <br>
to mez was a bit too much to hit mezzing classes with at one time. So we're <br>
going to back out of the &quot;all heals break mez&quot; addition, but keep purge in. <br>
This way we can evaulate the effect it has on mez and then take further steps <br>
from there. Be advised that we probably will take further steps, but probably <br>
not such a drastic step as all heals breaking it. <br>
<br>
WORLD NOTES <br>
<br>
Realm v. Realm - Frontier Keeps: It should be easier to target NPC archers at <br>
all frontier keeps, and particularly the hibernian frontier keeps. <br>
<br>
CRAFTING SYSTEM NOTES <br>
<br>
- Added in the ability for armorcrafters and tailors to make the &quot;level 6&quot; <br>
version of their various types of armor. This enables them, at the material <br>
10 level, make armor that is 51st level (versus the 50th level of dropped <br>
items and quest items).  This will enable tradeskillers to make the current <br>
highest possible base AF armors for their realms. <br>
<br>
- Timers for all of the recipes have been changed. This has a slight increase <br>
to the timers at the high end, but is about the same, if not lower, for the <br>
level 10 materials. You will notice a distinct drop in the timer for materials 6-9. <br>
We changed the base equation that we used for the timers so everything <br>
was more uniform.  Weaponcrafters should notice a significant decrease in <br>
the *overall* time it takes to craft a weapon. They still take the most time <br>
to make a single item, but it isn't as artificially high as it was before. <br>
<br>
- To coincide with the addition of salvage values for almost every single item <br>
that is dropped or quested (see note at end), we also equalized the salvage <br>
values for crafted items as well. They were set too high before, and in some <br>
cases would allow a crafter to salvage enough material back to make a positive <br>
amount of coin.  Salvage was always intended to allow you to get materials <br>
back from items from the world, not allow you to powerskill up without any <br>
additional coin from your own items. <br>
<br>
***Note: Any weapon, armor, etc, that drops/is quested should be salvagable <br>
now.  Most of the other drops, as well, should give you some type of salvage, <br>
but it is possible that the object wasn't set up properly for that. As we have <br>
time, we'll be going back through to try to change that.*** <br>

tomorrow morning.<br>
<br>
Note that if you've been following along with the patch notes the past few <br>
days there won't be anything new; we're just updating the documentation <br>
to match what's going into the game tomorrow. We've also hopefully made <br>
the list somewhat less browser-choking.<br>
<br>
Realm Abilities<br>
last updated 5/6/02 8:00p EDT<br>
<br>
The time has come to take the wraps off our new Realm Ability system. The <br>
purpose of this system is to give higher-level players new abilities that they <br>
can attain by engaging in RvR combat. A secondary benefit is to give classes <br>
more abilities that can help them during RvR battles - for example, one of <br>
the Realm Abilities open to melee classes is to gain an increased resistence <br>
to stun/mez spells. Please note that this system will require lots of testing, <br>
and many of the abilities listed here will probably change at least a little<br>
based on tester feedback.  We may also add new abilities, or shuffle existing <br>
ones around during the testing process.<br>
<br>
Please remember that there are Realm Ranks and Realm Levels. There are <br>
100 Realm levels, which are divided into 10 Realm Ranks.  For the Realm <br>
Ability system, each player will receive one Realm Skill Point for each Realm <br>
Level attained - giving the player a maximum of about 100 points to <br>
spend on these new abilities.<br>
<br>
In order to &quot;spend&quot; Realm Ability Points on a skill, you'll go to your <br>
standard class trainer. The Realm Abilities available to your class will be listed <br>
there. Please note that you do not have to have a high number of Realm <br>
Levels to be able to take advantage of these new abilities - in almost all cases, <br>
a character that has just a few realm levels can purchase at least a couple <br>
of new abilities.<br>
<br>
There are two types of realm abilities: Passive and Active. Passive realm <br>
abilities are always on, and can affect your character in small ways, generally <br>
3% per level (high levels of passive realm abilities grant substantial bonuses, <br>
however). Active abilities have re-use timers between 5 and 30 minutes, <br>
and are either instant effects or duration effects lasting between 30 and <br>
60 seconds. Each class has a list of abilities tailored to them, and each <br>
class has an ability unique to them.<br>
<br>
Some realm abilities have multiple levels, and each level will add more bonus. <br>
For example, the Augmented Strength realm ability awards 6 Strength points <br>
per level of the ability purchased, and there are five levels. So, in our example, <br>
a Level 3 Augmented Strength would give +18 Strength to a character.<br>
<br>
The costs for each level of ability, as well as the advanced abilities increase with <br>
the level you are trying to attain. Also, please note that some Realm Abilities have <br>
pre-requisites that must be purchased before you can buy them. Pre-requisite <br>
skills may have to be purchased to a given level before an advanced skill can be trained. <br>
<br>
Without further ado, here are the new Abilities, both listed, and broken down by class.<br>
<br>
