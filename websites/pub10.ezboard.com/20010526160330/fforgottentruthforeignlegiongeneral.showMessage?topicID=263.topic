When I was asked to lead a raid into a Reedshark Haven near Khayyaban I made myrth of the situation that lay before me and tried to hide my slight fear at once more having such a responsiblity lain upon my shoulders. not since the fatefull Day of Ashes have I been tasked with such a thing. Before that day I was highly skilled in leading or at least playing my side of the coin in my small band of friends. Providing deffensive support when needed and a pressing offense when needed. Like the two hands of a Skilled swordsman m'old friend and I would take our turns one fiengting and the other attacking, Parrying and thrusting, each switching off and complimenting the other until all foes within range of our powers were vanquished. But....that was before.....<br>
 ::Harl takes a deep shuddered breath and sighs as if trying to relinquish a burden that can not be put aside::   I was afraid.... of what might happen.<br>
  Of course Ldy Ullycia led us in with her own type of frenzied courage only the truly mad can posses Slashing the sharks with seemingly wild but very focused attacks. Weevil and I fought hard up the middle just to keep track of her frenzied onslaught with Syndra bringing up the rear with a unworldly volly of arrows defeating many of the foul beast before my blade might even strike thier thickened hides. Aye truly has been quite some time since I have fought beside anyone for any period of time worth true mentioning. I have grown accustomed to relying upon my own wits and protecting only myself. I ahve become well skilled in doingso but alas in that doingso I have lost any cohesiveness that I once had in fighting with such a skilled group. I had falsely assumed that anything these young sprouts could come up against would easily be dispatched with one fell swoop of my enchanted blade. Tis that assumption that put me quickly to the wall trying to watch my own back again and getting Syndra killed in the process. I had one of the nasty critts in my sights when he ducked my swing and bolted for her evidently tired of the flying death she had been pouring on top of him. <br>
I was in such shock that all I could do was fall to the ground as my swing became extended in the failing attempts to reach him before he got to her. Yet at the same time I was amazed by the bravery in which she fought him before he could finally take her down.<br>
   In my absence Weevil and Ullycia had easily dispatched the other three or four sharks that had surrounded them no thanks to me.  Later once we had captured and overtaken the chest room across a small bridge Syn went out to Find Lrd Crow for a nice quick Jump out to home. It was durring this small recess that I became currious and traveld back inside the chest room to take a curious peek at what had returned if anything. AYE they had come back. Three of them. Veterans too if I recall correctly. twas nothing I could do but to try and block the hall. But they soon had me hard pressed against the wall and a fourth joined into the fray. Two stayed on me and the other two quickly set to surprise attacking Ullycia and Weevil. I stood my ground as best I could but they got the better of me and My only thoughts were as to what daterdly fate had I left my newfound freinds. Had I not ventured around the corner and down the hall they would never have noticed us. But for my curious disregard of prudence  Lrd weevil and Ldy Ullycia would surely fall. I returned as speedily as I could only to find the two in good spirits as they tended to thier wounds. They had slain the lot of the beasts and were chatting happily with eachother as if the situation had ner happened. ::Harl pauses in remembrace of the sight::<br>
  Aye... Such bravery have I not known for such a long time. Once again the Lord of the Forests of Dereth has show me the error of my ways and watched ore my companions. Youngsters I called them but yet they are learned beyond my years. Such a young group raiding a place that I would not to this day dare set foot in alone. The artistic beauty in which they fought. Such cohesion and complimenting skills I have not seen in ore two fold. Humbling it twas....VERY humbling. I know now that I have much to learn of the ways of Dereth and that surely even the youngest knows more than me about this strange land. To those who fought with me in the Reedshark Haven and to those in this family who could not make it. I hold you all in the highest revrance. I only hope that one day I can repay my debt and show a fraction of the courage that was shown to me in such a terrible place. It shall be quite some time before I can put the sight of Ldy Syndra, teeth bared and arrows flying, falling to her demise out of my mind.  I have such a long journey ahead of me to become such a finely tuned instrument as those who I fought with last night. But I pledge to do my best. In the Name of the Forest Lords may it be so. Thank you for thy enlightenment into my own vulnerbilities and thy courageous ways.<br>

I know as soon as you open the gate 2 sharks will cruise around the surface portal while another waits within the first passage. I know in that first passage spawns 3 of those beasties while at the top spawns a pup. So on and so forth. Syndra knows this as well ... that is why she hung back and covered everyone else. True, she can only take 1 or 2 hits, but she knows her job in those type of situations. The same applies to you...you know your job and you did it. So what if fate decided Syndra would die once and you as well. It happens. Syndra knows how much damage she can take and stood in front of that door incase Ullycia found the correct lever to pull. If anyone made a mistake it was Syn for not telling you and Weevil to be ready for a rush atack from those sharks behind the door. Syn knew it was coming...but she didn't think to tell the rest of the group. You led well and we had fun!

Beautiful writing Harl!<br>
<br>
I don't think there was much we could have done to prevent Syndra's death. Ideally we had the door blocked when it opened, but it often doesn't work as you planned. Weevil actually lagged and warped to a point inside the doorway and behind the reedsharks, who made a beeline to poor Syndra.<br>
<br>
We all should have been more alert when the sharkies spawned in the chest room while we were stuck in there. Heh heh, the room was filled with them when the door opened, we probably should have remembered that they must have come from somewhere! Weevil had taken off all his powered items, so he wasted precious seconds running around like an idiot while blindly punching hotkeys in the hopes that they might equip something useful. In case you didn't notice, Weevil is not the brightest bulb in the marquee.<br>
<br>
If you get swarmed like that, there's only a couple of things you can do. First is to try and back yourself in a corner... NEVER give critters a shot at your back if you can help it. Your shield won't help you back there, and I think your melee def is lower in attacks from your rear as well. The end result is you'll end up taking massive critical hits in the back; not good. Be careful not to let yourself get pulled out of your corner. If the monster you're fighting turns to attack someone else, hit a movement key to break off your attack so he doesn't pull you with him. Also, autotarget can hurt you in a mob; it will often target a critter in the back of the pack or one two rooms away, and if you try to attack it you'll get pulled out. After you kill one beast hit the &quot;target closest&quot; key to ensure you'll be attacking something in the front of the pack.<br>
<br>
If you know right off you're in trouble and can never take on the whole angry mob, try to run around a corner and get a wall between you and your pursuers. The critters in Dereth aren't real bright, and some of them might get hung up on the wall trying to get to you. One tactic that works sometimes is to stop to fight them just on the other side of the corner. The first ones around the corner will stop to fight you, while the rest get stuck behind them along the wall as they try to make a beeline to you. But remember, whenever you turn to run you should expect to take a couple of good hits in the back, so it's best to do it when you're still near full health. <br>
<br>
Sorry for the rambling, but maybe there's some tips in there you might find useful. Not that you did anything wrong Harl, in fact you fought very well! You never panicked, fought bravely, and were very effective! Weevil would be proud to cower behind you anytime!</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#6B8E23><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/uceleroy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Celeroy</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>ezOP</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>10/10/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>12:46:45 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=263.topic&index=5><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Reply</FONT></A></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: A Child in Thier Midst</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Great stuff Harl!
