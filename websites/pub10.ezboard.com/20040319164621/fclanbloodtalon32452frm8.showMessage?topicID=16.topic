<br>
This quest begins at an NPC named Kurron Ni who spawns near the docks in Fort Danak. This NPC is a rare spawn so don't be discouraged if he is not there the first few times you check for them. <br>
<br>
Do not worry if you are killed on sight at the fort. Kurron spawns near the docks and you will be able to swim or invis yourself to get to him. He is also far enough away from other NPC's that you do not have to worry about them aggroing you when you are there.<br>
<br>
If you ask him what he seeks(do not ask him what his mission is or he will attack you) and then agree to his terms(tell him &quot;I agree&quot;) then he will tell you that he seeks three pieces of darkforge armor(helm, chest and leggings) and 900pp. <br>
<br>
Before turning in these items you need to gather up a good party and have them accompany you. Two groups would be best. <br>
<br>
Handing these items in to him will simply gain a raise in TrueSpirit faction and he will say that his mission is nearly complete. He will reward you with no items. If you ask him what mission he will tell you of his treachery and then attack you.<br>
<br>
At this point you must kill him. Upon killing him you will find a &quot;Note to Duriek&quot; on his corpse. You will need this for the next portion of the quest.<br>
<br>
NOTE: You MUST first hand in these items or he will not drop the note. This has been tested and confirmed.<br>
<br>
Duriek can be found overlooking the newbie area in Paineel. He is upstairs in the newbie area looking out through the glass. If you hand him the note he will tell you a story of his apprentice. He will also tell you to &quot;take this for your efforts.&quot; but no item will be given. I'm not sure if this is broken or not. I have contacted Verant about it with no response. Someone has told me that Verant responded to this on a public board saying that no item is supposed to be given but I was never able to find the thread. Either way you receive TrueSpirit faction and are able to continue the quest.<br>
<br>
If you ask him what apprentice he will give you further background. Tell him that you will take his apprentice's place and he will ask you to prove your worth first. Duriek is aging and is in need of a cough elixir. This is obtained via a side quest in Neriak. <br>
<br>
Upon returning the cough elixir to Duriek he will inform you that he was trying to create a corrupted ghoulbane. Unfortunately he is no condition to gather the components. His previous apprentice was searching for them when he met his demise. <br>
<br>
He needs you to find a tome for him. This tome can be found in The Hole on Ratman Guards. The best place to find these guards is by taking a left upon entering the first fortress and then take another left and pass down past the pool. Between this area and the old city beneath it Ratman Guards spawn fairly commonly as patrollers. <br>
<br>
Beware that these rats are extremely tough. They hit for 370s, are very magic resistant and have a ton of hit points. The tome is a rare drop on them so you are likely going to have to kill several of them to obtain one. Our first encounter with one we had 7 people and no deaths but we had a high level party and Turgur's stuck on the first attempt. In later raids we had as many as 25 people and might lose 5-8 people each attempt. A lot of it depends on if you can get Turgurs or another speed reducing spell to stick early.<br>
<br>
Handing the Tome to Duriek will grant another faction adjustment and will reveal what items he will need to complete the corrupted ghoulbane. He requires:<br>
<br>
1) Blade of Abrogation from the Plane of Air<br>
2) Soul Leech from Cazic Thule in the Plane of Fear<br>
3) Ghoulbane from upper guk. <br>
4) Decrepit Sheath from a Qeynos side quest.<br>
<br>
Returning this items to him will result in a corrupted ghoulbane(dmg 16 delay 34 effect dismiss undead sk only 1hslash) and will send you to seek out Lhranc in the City of Mist. This item is not much use to a shadowknight of this level but it is required for the next portion of the quest.<br>
<br>
Lhranc spawns approximately at location 0,0 in the City of Mist. This is just before the Reaver area near the large hut with all of the Goos. He spawns in the middle hut right past the big goo house. He spawns at the bottom and the two NPC's who spawn upstairs are not placeholders. Upon speaking with him he will reveal what he needs to forge your weapon.<br>
<br>
Each of these steps is accomplished by completing a sub-quest. These sub-quests all tie in together. The heart of an innocent and the will of innoruuk are wearable items that are among the best that shadowknight can attain. As a result these sub-quests are listed with their own seperate pages that are cross-linked together. They are listed in the neccessary order of completion.<br>
<br>
Heart of an Innocent<br>
The Will of Innoruuk<br>
Head of the Valiant<br>
<br>
Return these three items along with the corrupted ghoulbane to Lhranc and he will reward you by turning in to a living version of himself wielding the almighty Innoruuk's Curse. Killing him will allow you to loot the weapon.<br>
