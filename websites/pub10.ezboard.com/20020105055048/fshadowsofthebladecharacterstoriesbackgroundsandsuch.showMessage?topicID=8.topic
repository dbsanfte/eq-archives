Please not Crieth was not really integral to the story of the Statues and as such went a bit astray with it.<br>
<br>
Crieth sat swaying gently back and forth, lost in depths of thought, on the end of the pier in Oasis. <br>
<br>
A difficult condition for one of the Dead to be in, or so their detractors would say. &quot;Glory to the Queen and our Dark Father&quot;. &quot;The Blood of the Dead for the Teir 'Dal&quot;. Aye, the ShadowKnights of Neriak were known more for acts of unsurpassed brutality than for the constructs of their minds. <br>
<br>
Yet deep beneath the cold and soulless iron carapaces of these unholy automata, the warm flesh of some very keen intellects hid, and watched, and thought. Some minds keenly saw the ebb and flow of armies in great battles, some the great mysteries of the arcane, some could sway the thoughts of others, yet others could piece the even the most guarded of hearts. To each, the gifts of the Dark Father are different. To Crieth had come the gift of prescience. <br>
<br>
Her mind now swirled with countless myriad fragments of ideas. They danced, like the reflections of the moon on the surface of the ocean before her. Like fireflies under a mating moon, they circled madly, urgently seeking to consummate themselves and join to produce some coherent whole.  Yet such such recognition eluded her. <br>
<br>
Staring remotely into the lightening sky, she sought once more bring her thoughts into focus, and over her the visions once again flowed: <br>
<br>
    . . .the Redhand, so serenely disposed in her chambers, yet eyes mad with some earthly lust as they stared at the bundle before her. . . <br>
<br>
    . . . the Obsidian Blade, seemingly disintegrating before her eyes. . . <br>
<br>
    . . . the face of a human ranger, lips drawn back in a rictus of agony and hate as her blade defiled his manhood and eviscerated him in one easy motion . . . <br>
<br>
    . . . humans, drilling and training for battle in a secluded glade, their faces stern and grim, yet confident . . . <br>
<br>
    . . . the General, staring intently at lists in front of him, fists balled in impotent fury . . . <br>
<br>
    . . . The Statue. It's inky black finish seeming to draw all light unto itself. She could almost feel the silky smoothness of its surface. The sleek almost sensual lines of the proud beast it depicted. And above all, the almost palpable feeling of power that emanated from it. The answers to all her questions, the solution to all her problems and the satisfaction all her desires lay within that figure. It had to be hers, she had to posess it, let it posess her, feel it. She could feel it drawing her mind, her soul to it. She . . . <br>
<br>
Crieth jumped up, her eyes wide with terror, her companion blade dropping to the planks beside her. Then, trembling violently, she sank back to the deck as the first rays of the sun crested the distant horizon before her. The spell was broken, and the visions lost. <br>
<br>
The Statue. She had never seen it, never really heard of it, except as snatched fragments of conversation in passing. Yet it had seemed so real in her mind. What was it, and what power did it have over the Redhand, the Blade, her and others. Her mind, now whirring madly, sought to order these and other flashes that had come to her. <br>
<br>
There was one who could help her, perhaps infer some order from these chaotic fragments. Yet she was loath to embark on a quest to seek such knowledge, for she feared what the revelations might mean for her, and her new found companions. <br>
<br>
Visibly shaken from the nights events, Crieth packed together her things and turned her back on the warmth of the rising sun. Away to the West was the person she sought, that much her prescience told her, yet whether she should seek him out or not, now that was a choice that her gifts could not make. <br>
<br>
Yet - for now she could not make that choice. Old fears and uncertainties arose within her, drowning out the sense of purpose she had so recently found. Her mind, so recently clear, clouded again with doubt. <br>
<br>
Sighing, the deeply disturbed Caretaker of the Obsidian Blade, trudged off through the dunes. <br>
<br>
<br>
Crieth, the Caretaker of the Obsidian Blade. <br>

<br>
It assaulted her like with a violence unmatched in her experience. Keener than a Demon claw, it pierced her very soul to the core, bleeding her spirit and sanity, and leaving her bereft of feeling, of reason and of purpose. <br>
<br>
The silence of rejection. She was an outcast, deprived of the only ones she had called friends for as long as she could remember. She was no longer the Caretaker of the Obsidian Blade, but a foolish Teir 'Dal, alone in the world, and bereft of purpose. <br>
<br>
She had rejected the visions that had came to her but days before, and the search for someone to answer their riddles, in seemingly futile allegiance to the Guild that no longer held any allegiance to her. <br>
<br>
Crieth sat alone, contemplating the bloody ruin that was once her left leg with an eerie detachment. Above her diminutive form towered a blackened mangrove, disappearing upwards like an ebon tombstone into the moist darkness that characterised the Feerott, day and night. Before her, lay the stiffening form of a Lizard man, one of a party that had dogged her hunting for hours. <br>
<br>
Around her, the forest hooted and chirped with myriad bestial conversations, yet in the blackness of her fluttering heart, only the silence of isolation registered. <br>
<br>
Only a week before, emboldened with responsibility for a cohort of Blade Apprentices in the looming conflict with the Truthbringers, her life had seemed complete. Now outcast (or so it seemed), racked by increasingle violent and apocalyptic visions, and lost, she longed for the blessed release of death. <br>
<br>
&quot;Take me now, father of lies - for no greater harm can ye do to me&quot;, she screamed. <br>
<br>
A chorus of croaks and incomprehensible gutteral commands from the undergrowth to the South, gave witness to how soon her wish would be granted. The shouts of her reptilian pursuers grew louder and bolder as the first scaly head appeared a way from her. <br>
<br>
Her mind had chance for but a brief instant of intense searing pain as an unseen blade swung from her right, severing it's fragile vessel from her Iron clad torso, and sending it skittering across the mossy forest floor. <br>
<br>
Her dead eyes stared on unseeing as the lizardmen rougly tore at her armour and belongings, like a violent lover raging to reveal her flesh, while her soul fled, back to it's birthplace. <br>
<br>
Horrifying vistas of fire and blood and pain assaulted the eyes of her soul as it returned, like a whipped dog from her corporeal form to the halls of the Dark Father of the Teir 'Dal. <br>
<br>
&quot;WHY ART THOU HERE AGAIN- THOUGH UNGRATEFUL PEON&quot; the great voice of the God boomed at Crieth. <br>
<br>
&quot;THOU ART MY TOOL, AND THOU SHALT DO MY BIDDING&quot;. She was transfixed, as the mighty visage of the God filled her dead vision, the unholy face grim with ire and contempt. <br>
<br>
&quot;I COMMANDED THEE TO SEEK FOR THE HERETIC, FOR IN THIS, THE UNBELIEVERS SHALL DO MY BIDDING. WHY HAST THOU NOT GONE TO HIM?&quot;. <br>
<br>
&quot;I could not . . I did not, I will NOT be thine or anyone elses pawn again&quot;. Crieths mind screamed at her master in impotent insubordination.<br>
<br>
&quot;Find that heretic Lokus thyself, if thou cans't, for I shall not betray my friends, my comrades, my family of the Blade&quot; she riposted, mind burning with a fierce fire of rebellion. <br>
<br>
&quot;I AM THY ONLY FRIEND, THY ONLY COMRADE, AND THY ONLY FAMILY, AND THOU ART MINE TO DO WITH AS I PLEASE. DO NOT FOOL THYSELF THAT ANYTHING IS OTHER THAN AS I DOOM IT TO BE.&quot;. Innoruuk roared, his words threatening to rip her very reason to shreds.<br>
<br>
&quot;THOU HAST BEEN MADE AS A TOOL FOR ME AND MY SPORT ALONE, WITHOUT ME - THOU WOULD'ST NOT BE&quot;. <br>
<br>
&quot;Then unmake me thou Carrion Lord, send me to the deepest pits of hell, for thou cans't torment me no more than thou hast already&quot; Crieth challenged, the last vestiges of her sanity now collapsing under the weight of the dark lords spite. <br>
<br>
&quot;THOU WILT DO MY BIDDING&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;No, thou cannot rule me any more, feed my to thy demons, punish me for eternity, but thou can'st not . . &quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;SO BE IT&quot;, the Gods voice changed to an echoing laughter that smashed her like the crashing of a storm tide on the cliffs of her psyche. <br>
<br>
&quot;WELCOME TO THY HELL - FOOL&quot; boomed the voice once again with a dreadful sense of finality. <br>
<br>
And then she was gone. <br>
<br>
Crieth sank, naked and sobbing uncontrollably to the ground as the laughter of the Innoruuk echoed through her ears. <br>
<br>
The Dragoon on the gate, unnerved by her untimely arrival stepped back, then resumed his watchful vigilance at the gates of Neriak, home of the Children of Innoruuk. <br>

Her mind wandered, lost in the pathless labyrinths of the mountains of madness, until at last it stood upon the uttermost precipice, and stared out upon the tempestuous ocean of insanity. <br>
<br>
The foaming breakers below called to her with a sighing echo of the voice of Innoruuk, and her consciousness longed for the easy release of a step forward into that unknown. <br>
<br>
Once more the visions came to her, only more vivid than before, now unfettered by the shackles of sanity. They buffetted her, like storm winds blown up from the mighty ocean below. Like the carmine blood of a slaughtered enemy they drenched her, seemingly smothering her essence in a miasma of gore, clouding her sight and choking her breath. <br>
<br>
Again and again she harkened to the sirens call, and stepped towards merciful oblivion, but always the visions would blast her back. For an age she stood and battled with the storm there upon the brink. Endlessly she considered that choice - and at the last, rejected it. <br>
<br>
Like a taughtened spring suddenly released, her mind leapt back to her, and her inner fires waxed brilliant once more. <br>
<br>
With a muffled groan, she came back from her wanderings , and slowly focussed on the here and now. Before her clearing vision a scorpion, startled by her stirrings, scuttled away. To her ears at last returned the sounds of the forest, and the muted hub-bub of voices from the city below. <br>
<br>
Rising, as if from a deep sleep she turned, walked past the disconcertingly intent stares of the gate guards, and headed down the short tunnel to the Foreign Quarter. <br>
<br>
Down into the heart of the city she walked, her mind at last focussing on the future and what she felt she must do. She would seek for the unbelievers, but not for the purposes of the mad god. Nor for the purposes of the blade, or the Dead. She would seek them for herself. For if damnation was her only eternal fate, then at last she would meet it on her own terms. <br>
<br>
Something had changed in Crieth, as yet something undefined, but the self-hatred that had characterised her former self seemed cowed for the moment, restrained perhaps by some deeper purpose that hovered, clouded for now, in the recesses of her mind. <br>
<br>
Gathering from the obsequious Anton F'lok some patchwork and a Tarnished sword, the scarred Teir 'Dal turned her face on her racial home, and headed out for the country. <br>
<br>
With a steely resolve, at last one of her own, now sited within her, she set off on the long journey to seek the heretic. <br>
<br>

<br>
Though she had travelled at times in the lands beyond the High Pass, even as far as the distant Lake Rathe, she had either travelled the southern route through Feerott, or been transported there by Maliken of the Blade. <br>
<br>
Now both paths were unavailable to her, for Feerott contained the detritus of a previous life - one that she had chosen to transcend - and the Blade were no more. She had considered making contact with her former associates, but for the moment found the thought too painful to comtemplate. <br>
<br>
Like a fledgeling, taking it's first tentative hops towards aerial freedom, she needed achieve this on her own. No she HAD to achieve this on her own, that much she new for sure. Why she sought so hard for her quarry she could not put into words, only that it had something to do with the riddle of the statues, the madness of the Redhand, and a final severance from her former life. <br>
<br>
Through this evil forest, across the notorious High Pass, and down into the Karanas she must go. Her prey was hunting there with his Erudite sidekick, that much she knew. <br>
<br>
At least thought she new. They had met but twice, at the wedding of Morrigu and Dantrazz, and once hunting with the now long departed Mephala. An unimposing man, the leader of the Evoluxans was, yet with a quiet power that emanated from him. <br>
<br>
Once more she sought within her mind for the reason behind this compulsion to seek him, but the reason evaded her once more. Perhaps it was his rejection of the dark ways of hate that called her, for perhaps in his peace with that separation would come an answer to her own inner turmoil. <br>
<br>
He was, as much as her, a child of the madness of Innoruuk, and yet to her seemed at peace with the world. The self-loathing and consuming hatred that characterised the actions of the Teir 'Dal through her eyes, seemed to have no hold over the heretics, yet she could not see how the spawn of Innoruuk could live another way. A piece, deep inside her clicked into place, but what meaning the whole would eventually bring to her, Crieth could not for now comprehend. <br>
<br>
She filed that thought away for the moment, for the Westering sun, gleeming a deep ochre was already kissing the tops of the hills ahead, and the passage of Kithicor was perilous enough in daytime, let alone with the demons the darkness brought abroad. <br>
<br>
Steeling herself for the perils ahead, she set off into the gathering gloom of the haunted forest. <br>
<br>
Crieth <br>
The darker side of the Dead <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bshadowsoftheblade.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=crieth>crieth</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local user</span><br>   <font color=#939393>(4/6/00 2:54:41 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> . . . into the trees</span><hr size=1> The sun was below the distant horizon by the time Crieth came at last, panting and heaving, to the end of the narrow gorge through the hills that separated Kithicor from the Commons. <br>
<br>
She had tarried overlong in the Commons, and then, just as she started the descent at last, she had been startled by a faint, but haunting familiar mental call. The call had been garbled, but it's meaning was clear enough. It was a call to arms from the Obsidian Blade. <br>
<br>
She new not why they called, for since her untimely and unexplained expulsion from their ranks, no contact had she had with her former associates. The call was urgent, and tinged with overtones of fear and violence. For a brief moment, a vision, clear and sharp, of swinging blades and unleashed magics washed over her. She saw, with a growing shock of recognition, the bodies of those she had once called friends, now cruelly hewn on the floor of what she saw to be the Blade's keep. Then as quickly as it had come, the vision, and the call was gone. <br>
<br>
She stood, chewing nervously on her lip, contemplating what to do. The clarion call had been urgent, no doubt, yet little could she, but a 15th Season apprentice do against the violence unleashed against her former comrades. Besides, the quest upon which she had now embarked concerned not just the Blade, but her own future. The madness of hate that had almost overcome her, and the path to the downward spiral of her former existence were still with her, for the moment cowed, but ready to burst forth at any moment. <br>
<br>
No, though her heart had surged at the contact, and longed for the release from isolation it signified, she must eschew for the moment association with the Blade, lest it lead to her own oblivion. Anyway, she thought, there may be no Blade to return too, if the visions that had told her aright, there may be no Blade to return too. <br>
<br>
She had shut her eyes then, against the grief that unexpectedly arose within her at the though of her fallen comrades. This was not an emotion with which she felt familiar, and it threatened to overwhelm her with it's intensity. But with an effort of will, she set herself once more upon the path she had chosen, and loped off on her interrupted journey Westwards. <br>
<br>
Now Crieth stood, nervously fondling the pommel of her sword, while she searched her memories for guidance as to the way to go from here. <br>
<br>
Ahead, a narrow path led off into the deep gloom of the forest, lost all to soon in the mists that swirled around the trunks of the mighty trees. The moonlight that lit the pass behind her, seemed swallowed in the inky darkness ahead, and even her keen ultravision, gift of all the Teir 'Dal, could not penetrate all of it's depths. <br>
<br>
This path had been well trodden once, or so she remembered from younger days, when the woods were not the realm of the unquiet dead. But then had come the daughter of Innoruuk, whipping up the Teir 'Dal into a frenzy, and leading an army of eager young warriors through this woods, and on to a futile confrontation with the lightdwellers in High Pass. <br>
<br>
Too many of her kin had met a bloody end in that foolhardy escapade, and now their tortured souls walked these woods, barring to all but the most stout-hearted, or the most foolhardy, the road to the West. Though she, and many of her kind were familiar with the ways of the Undead, and used them for their own purposes, the creatures of Kithicor took no quarter, and would slay the creatures of the darkness with as little concern as for those of light. Perhaps with less, for the victims of the folly of Lanys T'Vyl had little love for their living brethren, and hated their freedom to walk as they woulds't through the lands of Norrath. <br>
<br>
To her right, the encircling hills stretched off to the North, like a line of moor-clad senturies keeps guard over the denizens of the forest. That way was easier, for sure, but far longer, and the creatures of the dark would surely keep some guard over that way. <br>
<br>
Her contemplations were shattered by demonic laughter that burst from the gloom down the path. Not waiting to confront the owner of that fell voice, Crieth set off at a pace along the longer road, and hoped that her choice would go well, not ill. <br>
<br>
A change in the pitch of the laughter let her know that the vile creatures had caught her scent, and she redoubled her pace. Hooting cries of derision from the gloom ahead letting her know that no escape was to be had that way. <br>
<br>
Unsheathing her blade, and cursing herself for not retrieving her arms from her last demise, she steeled herself for the futile battle to come. Out of the darkness loomed not one but three Skeleton Lieutenants, armed each with halberd and clad in scraps of raw hide. <br>
<br>
Whirling like a cat, she swung the heavy two-handed blade in a vicious arc, sliding through the guard of the nearest enemy and biting into it's pelvis like an axe into wood. Bone and marrow sprayed from the gash in a wide arc, but it's pace, and menace seemed undiminished. <br>
<br>
Barely recovering her balance, she had scant time to raise her blade to check a deathly blow from the next attacker and though she did, she could not evade the bony fist which rose to strike her exposed head. Her vision spun for a moment as it jarred her skull, and her mouth filled with warm salty evidence of the damage the blow had done to her cheek. <br>
<br>
Striking and parrying again and again, the tiring Crieth new that the battle was already lost, and wondered why the killing blow would not fall. <br>
<br>
Through her weakening guard, a scything halberd came, biting into the ebon flesh of her shoulder like a mighty steel fireband, spraying blood and gristle into the air, tearing a terrible rent into the flesh, even to the bone. Bereft of support, her sword fell from the now useless arm, and she slumped in mind-numbing agony to the forest floor. <br>
<br>
Yet the releasing death blow would not come as her antagonists drew their defeated prey up to a stand. Turning their bony visages towards the trees, they hooted evil calls in her own tongue. <br>
<br>
&quot;Come my lord, see what we have caught thee&quot;. &quot;Come and see.&quot; &quot;Come and play&quot;. <br>
<br>
Lifting her head with what little strength remained, Crieth stared through misty vision at the approaching figure. A mighty Teir 'Dal stood now before her, garbed in the decaying remnants of what was clearly once the livery of a noble house. Once a mighty Commander in Lanys T'Vyls army, now risen in fear and wrath and hatred - the figure was more skeleton the dark elf now. Decaying strips of what was once taut black flesh now clung to rotting muscle and bone, and a gagging reek of putrefaction oozed from every pore.<br>
<br>
In the orbless sockets of its undead eyes the fierce fires of Hell burned, and from its leering mouth screeched words of death, and hatred, and vengeance. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh the taste of a Teir 'Dal maiden, come to me at last for my sport alone.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I shall feast on the warmth of thy flesh slowly, my pretty one&quot;. <br>
<br>
&quot;You shall beg me to slay thee long before I have consumed thee to the last&quot;. <br>
<br>
The cruel digits pinioning her arms gripped tighter and fresh waves of pain from her shoulder washed over her, but refusing to allow her the blessed peace of unconsciousness. Tighter and tighter her captors gripped, bony digits penetrating the flesh of her wrists like tiny teeth, stopping all movement. Her nemesis stepped forward, arms spread to receive her like a welcoming lover, eyes full of an unearthly lust and hatred. <br>
<br>
Try as she could, Crieth knew that she would never truly expunge what was to follow from her memory. The indescribable sensation as the Undead Lord lowered the lipless slit of his mouth to her breast, his putrid tongue like some vile reptile lapping at the carmine flows of her life essence from the wound above. The excruciating pain as it moved up and probed the wound itself, parting the torn flesh and sinew, lapping inside like a thirsty beast at a waterhole. <br>
<br>
Always her dreams would be tormented by the lecherous mad jeering of his undead minions as they held her helpless form, urging their lord to leave the choicest morsels for their own feasting. <br>
<br>
As she felt at last the ridges of the Commander's teeth take hold of her flesh ready to consume, the jeering faltered, and turned to alarm. <br>
