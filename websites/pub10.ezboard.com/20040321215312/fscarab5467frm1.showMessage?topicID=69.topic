From all the strategies I've read / people I've talked to, DPS is the king.  One solid 60+ tank + casters and healers should do the trick.<br>

DPS is indeed crucial,  but its also worth mentioning that DPS comes from other things like switching targets fast, as well as raw dps output of each class.<br>
<br>
Tactics vary massively, but a few things are constant. You need a core group of high levels, generally that means 60+. You'll want buffs from outside your own group, KEI, Aego, Focus, as many different DS as you can stack (inc potions), mod rods, focus items to increase nuke dmg etc.<br>
<br>
Some things I've heard: <br>
Don't bother with slow. Get a meaty tank with a tonne of high level DS on him and preferably some form of AE taunt. Mobs will do themselves a lot of damage<br>
However, slower essential for the final boss mob who is pretty tough.<br>
Use heals over time, not CH, CH will get healers aggroed fast.<br>
AE tactics are one way that works well.<br>
Another option is melee dps with monk/rogue/bst, perhaps ench for crowd control if tank cant take all mobs at once<br>
Druids/Mages can banish the rocks, 10k in one cast has to be good. Mages also great for pet, nukes, and DS.<br>
Secondary healer very useful for healing the rest of the group.<br>
Some form of nuker is useful if a mob does get to the prisoner, to land that quick kill.<br>
<br>
I'm sure there's loads more, thats from memory and there are a lot of posts about it.<br>
<br>
In summary, it sounds tough, challenging.... and fun! Don't expect to pass first time, it will likely take quite a few attempts to sort out tactics. Requirements are probably level 60 minimum, and preferably lots of AA points too.<br>

I can't remember the classes we had on my first attempts.<br>
Next time we had a 61 Pal (tank), 60 SK, 60+ CLE, 60 ENC, 65BST and 61 DRU (me). It was close, we managed to get to 3rd wave but at some point we always killed a bit too slow - we almost never had any casualties.<br>
Then we tried to replace the SK by a 2nd BST (61?) and we still had the same problem. As far as i could see one problem comes from pets - it happens that one of the various pets starts to attack another mob than the rest of the group - and i am not sure what happens to the timer if this occurs (for those of you who don't know - you have to kill each mob within 30 seconds...so if you split your forces you already lost).<br>
I managed to banish stone mobs quite often though sometimes one resisted and then they got really mad at me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Anyway the recast time on banishment is quite long (120 seconds) and it is a bit expensive too (uses a star ruby as component - i used 11 last time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>
The cleric nuked a bit too if he could, the chanter too - having the chanter AE mezz seemed nice as casters dont get interrupted which tends to happen rather often if all mobs move around free (dark nemesis can't be mezzed though).<br>
All in all i had the feeling we would rather need a second nuker (i nuked like hell and a rod was crucial, focus items sure would help too) as mainly i was the only one nuking. I am not familiar with the dps of each class - but i guess a wizzard has still a higher one than a BST.<br>
I am also very curious how it would work out with an AE group - it should be doable especially as long as there are stonemobs, cause i think the timer should be reset when i banish one if it gets close.<br>
I am still very interested in doing it again - so count me in if you are giving it a try <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Baroness Lildariel Silberwolf<br> Woodelf Hierophant 61st season<br> Protagonists</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bscarab5467.showUserPublicProfile?gid=karoluseq>KarolusEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Little Quellious' Seer</span><br>  Posts: 358<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(1/2/03 8:12)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fscarab5467frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=69.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Flagging (Trail of Execution)</span><hr size=1> Well, definitely interested here though the things you tell confirm the rumors I heard ... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

We once considered doing Trials via AoE as it was said to work well, but it was agreed that we needed a few levels more first. But given that nothing beats AoE in terms of DPS, I would think this is the method of choice ...<br>
<br>

<br>
Wizard DPS is lower than a ranger using Trueshot, but using my draughts (with no damage or haste focus) I can do 729 points every 5 seconds (3 second cast + 2 second recast delay) aggro permitting.  An Ice spear (1200 damage) every 16 seconds (4 second cast with 12 second recast) would probably help.  <br>
<br>
AEing allows for insane DPS as the spells do 500-650 each but only have 2 second cast time (6 second recast, so its best to have all three, 2 would do at a pinch), so one can be cast every 4 seconds, which is a fast way to OOM ...<br>

It's very tough, and you have to be very very slick to complete it.  We didn't die, well cleric maybe died once.<br>
<br>
From what I can see DPS is the name of the game.  Consistent and high DPS.  I agree with you Goldark, that damage shield is the way to go.  I've made some damage shield potions now in anticiapation of our next venture.<br>
<br>
I was chatting to a high level shaman about tactics specifically for shaman, they reakon that shamans should slow 2 mobs per wave and off tank the 2 that they've slowed.  With damage shield they should be ok.  I'm not sure this is so practical for the likes of myself - without torpor or 5.5Khps, but I'm sure it's feasible to off tank 1 and assist with nukes / heals if required.<br>
<br>

a) Torpor (lvl 60 v rare spell)<br>
b) Spirit Call (lvl 61 AA ability)<br>
c) Project Alpha pet (shhh its a secret <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
d) Canni V (AA class ability 23AA total)<br>
e) DS potions (needs good alchemy skill)<br>
<br>
The suggestion of slowing 2 and off-tanking them sounds reasonable, especially with a few DS stacked up, and torpor so you keep yourself alive without bothering the cleric.<br>
<br>
Well, a few things for me to work on first I think, then perhaps I'll think about the trials.

Tank gotta pick target FAST!!! that is the tanks only job!<br>
<br>
Slow and mez is not needed to do, altho a shammy with nice hp and DS does smart in AE slowing them and offtanking them all so they dont kill DPS'ers and cleric<br>
<br>
Its important to use the best mana/dmg spells, with DPS spells in backup.<br>
<br>
Its important to ASSIST! I cant stress this enough.<br>
<br>
The trials are hard if you have low lvls in group, altho I have passed a couple of them with members more noob then a random lvl 30 untwinked char. (they were lvl 61 btw)<br>
<br>
Banish is nice, but they need MR debuff first, or they can cause you to fail.<br>
<br>
There is a lot more to say, but I dont remember all...<br>
<br>
Again, tell me if you are gonna try it, and if Im free, I can help... (not often free these days though, but its worth a shot.)<br>
<br>
the exp bonuses are indeed worth it. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=227830">Rabids Arch Convoker</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bscarab5467.showUserPublicProfile?gid=valsuvious>Valsuvious</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(1/14/03 14:03)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fscarab5467frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=69.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Flagging (Trail of Execution)</span><hr size=1> Rabids...if you can help assist me in getting flagged....then I will be your personal slave for a long time.  Seriously, I have failed 11 times now, and while it is nothing to note of from some of the stories I have read and heard, it still frustrates me.  What hurts even more, and I know that most other non flagged higher lvl shamans can agree with, is that I get asked for groups in PoS and PoV every day, but because a chanter is a bit better than a shaman in the trials, you will always find a couple of shaman in PoJ looking for a trial group.<br>
<br>
Now, I am thinking that it might be best to try this doing the AE tactics, but, I'm thinking that maybe a chanter might not be as great as a Bard.  Bard has the same things that a chanter can provide, but a Bard has their assortment of AE mezz and mana songs that can significantly add to the DPS of the battle, and for keeping the casters with mana.  I would like to try to do an AE group one day, and my ideal one (so that I can get flagged too), is this setup:  1x Bard (or chanter), 1x warrior tank, 1x wizard, 1x mage (or another wizzy) for banishment and AE, 1x cleric (for secondary healing and for dps on the non mezzable mobs) and of course me.  I would be the main healer for the normal mobs, then of course I would switch to back up healer on the boss mob.<br>
<br>
In regards to slowing two mobs, I currently have reached 4k hps with raid buffs, and I have 1097 ac with self buffs and Aego on.  Sitting at 17aa (at lvl 60, working to get 23 for canni 5 before I grind to 65) and I have torpor and malo and still somehow manage to break right around 255 wis with KEI.  I love to tank mobs in teh face, so slowing two of them and tanking them while the rest kill the other two, and torporing myself can help a lot.  But, I do not have my 61st pet yet, and I do not have the nice 1300 point lvl 62 heal (with a quick cast time on it).  I am considering once I get 23 aa to just try to get as high as I can levels wise and then grabbing a bunch of friends to do the trials.....had the perfect sounding DPS group a few times, but something always went wrong<br>
<br>
Just......frustrating <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bscarab5467.showUserPublicProfile?gid=doelloos>Doelloos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(1/24/03 10:27)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fscarab5467frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=69.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Flagging (Trail of Execution)</span><hr size=1> I'd love to join any Flag trails, I'm looking forward to more zones to get lost and die in.<br>

I've been looking into strategies for a bard in this trail. Looks like DS is the way to go, atm I can add a 38pt DS, if I can get my hands on a SS bracer that should boost it 10 to 15 pts. Along with extra attack and stack haste that should by my best bid for extra dps.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to testing my theories, lets get this started.<br>

I have been in with groups that, according to others, stood no chance and failed on the boss.  Been in with brilliant groups and failed on second wave cos I got mezzed.  I do feel there is an element of luck in these trials.  <br>
<br>
The group I finally succeeded with consisted of myself 62 cleric, 61 warrior, 63 druid, 65 rogue, 65 bard and 65 chanter.  How we did it I don't know cos we were ping ponging all over the show, but we did it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I did feel that supernal healing helped immensely cos I still had 80m for the boss mob, and I got a mod rod off a friendly mage before we went in.<br>

Why do so many people call them trails?<br>
<br>
Its a trial. When you trigger it you say...<br>
<br>
&quot;I am ready to do the trial of execution&quot; or something like that anyway. Its like a trial to see if the prisoner is guilty. Not a trail for you to walk along.<br>

Ok Goldark, Kan me goed voorstellen dat het erg irritant is dat niet iedereen fatsoenlijk engels spreekt. Kan gebeuren, mja, wij kunnen ook niet helpen dat we van huis uit een andere taal spreken en de moeite genomen hebben dit rare taaltje in ons brein te stampen. Wees blij dat we elkaar in ieder geval een beetje verstaan.<br>

I deeply respect the fact that so many people play EQ in a foreign language and meant no offense to anyone. I appreciate that you have take the effort to learn a foreign language, and done so far better than I. <br>
<br>
I've seen many, many English people talk about the &quot;trails&quot; - I didn't consider it a language issue, just a misunderstanding of what the event is really about - the trials for the prisoners. In retrospect I should have phrased my post completely differently, I didn't anticipate anyone seeing this as a language issue.  /bonk Goldark, not thinking about things properly yet again. Sorry for that, and I hope nobody else takes offense from my post - none was meant.<br>
<br>
As a complete aside, some of the stories the prisoners have to tell are quite well written and worth a read. I found most of them spoke the Common Tongue, and thus could fortunately understand them.<br>
<br>
Anyway - on with the trials!<br>
<br>

Anyways, needless to say, I jumped at the chance and ran there and after a bit of coaxing, they agreed to help me and we passed the second time through, with the first not switching targets fast enough on the second wave.  Like what has been said, you will not succeed if you have people that do not know their role and what they should be doing at all times.<br>
<br>
Here was my groups setup from what I remember.  Had, 60 shaman(me) 65sk (MT), 65 druid, 65 cleric, 64 rog, 65 bard.  Every mob died in about 20 secs, and the boss went down in about 30 secs.  Hell, I had enough time to cast malo, slow then malosini on the mob and he was dead by the time that hte third one died.  If I go back and think about it, this is what I came up with.  Obviously the SK was the MT.  The rogue and the bard assisted him asap.  The bard used his AE mezz and AE mana song, as well as his haste and his song that adds dmg to all nukes (not sure the name of it).  I would throw at least one nuke on each mob, sometimes more, and help a bit with the healing.  I maloed every mob that was around, to help the DPS of the melees...plus the pet was running around in there.  Only once did I grab agro for whatever reason and I got rid of it pretty quickly.  The druid and the cleric were nuking away, with I think the druid healing (I could be wrong, but since it went soo quickly and smoothly, I wasn't even sure).  I even think that the cleric was doing a bit of the meleeing in there.  When the fourth wave is finished, the boss mob will spawn behind you immediately.  Remember that there is going to be about a 10 sec rest in between waves, and the last boss gives you no rest.  As soon as he spawns...he needs to be slowed.  But, you will get a mitigated slow, which means that you can slow him, but it won't be fully effective.  I have no clue how effective, just that I got the message as soon as I cast it.<br>
<br>
Problem with most groups are they do not have the proper people for the fight.  Like it was said, there are classes that are great for this fight, and their are classes that aren't.  Depending on their lvl and equipment or skill, Mages and Wizards are good to have.  I understand that some of you do not have a horse, but you will have no time to sit around and med during the fighting, so a horse is almost essential if you want to have enough mana to cover you for the whole time there.  The fights are soo quick and you have to put out soo much to kill everything quick, you will need to have insane mana regen.<br>
<br>
So, my advice would be to grab at least 4 people that are insane dmg dealers in there, and fill the final two spots with people that need to be flagged.  At least one of those two classes need to be someone that can do some dmg.<br>
