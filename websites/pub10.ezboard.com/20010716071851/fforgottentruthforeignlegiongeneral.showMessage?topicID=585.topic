<br>
At <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://register.funcom.com/register.php">register.funcom.com/register.php</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> you use the activation key : 4SWT9O7S3F914P and then download the game.<br>
<br>
I haven't upgaded my computer yet. I just can't make a choice between a small budget upgrade or a nice big over-budget upgrade that will last more than a year. I have put this project on the ice till september. Summer is to short here to waste it on video games!<br>

I don't know if it would be enough to get me to switch from AC, but I figure I'll at least give it a look.<br>
<br>
It's summer??? (looks outside and blinks) Hmmm, no snow, I guess you must be right! I really should get out more, the only tan I get comes from the glare from my monitor. <br>

I finally got DSL back yesterday, so just for kicks I used your key to register and then downloaded the beta. It's really, really buggy, but if they get it fixed, it could be a lot of fun. I only got my character up to level 6, so I still have no idea what I'm doing, but here's some quick impressions so far:<br>
<br>
The graphics are really nice. Better character models than EQ, and better landscapes than AC. All equipment shows up on the character, and besides chosing your race and face, you can chose your body type and height too, so no two characters look the same. Cities are huge, at least the two Omni cities I've seen so far. Much bigger than anything in EQ.<br>
<br>
Character creation seems like a mix between AC and EQ. It's a mix between class and skill based. Any class can use any skill, but it's more expensive for some classes to raise a given skill than others. For instance, an engineer is mostly a pet and trade skill class, so it would cost him way more xp to get his rifle skill up to the same level as a soldier. But if he wanted, he could probably get it high enough to take a few potshots at a monster while his robot pet was tanking it. It's more flexible than EQ, but you don't end up with everyone being a jack-of-all-trades like AC.<br>
<br>
The only thing completely class restricted is nano formulas; these are exactly like magic spells. You buy them once in a store, and then there's no need to restock components (woohoo). Every class gets a few, but some use them almost completely. There's nukes, DoT, roots, buffs, pretty much everything in EQ except maybe the crowd control spells. Some classes also get robot pets. I've only played a soldier though, so I only have 2 spells right now, a lame damage shield and a little hp boost. Best thing is, they last for a half hour. No rebuffing every 10 minutes, sweet! Not much downtime either, there's cheap kits to replenish health and mana between fights.<br>
<br>
Ok, I've rambled enough. I can post some more if anyone is interested. Bottom line, it seems like it could be a lot of fun IF they fix all the bugs. I've already pre-ordered it, and I'm glad I did, but I'm not sure if it will be enough for me to give up my AC account.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for the key Dia, I've had a lot of fun with it! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ugharadin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gharadin</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif BORDER=0> at: 6/17/01 10:24:29 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6B8E23><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bforgottentruthforeignlegion.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dia>Dia</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(6/18/01 8:23:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=585.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: anarchy-online</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the review Ghar!

Is there a place to store our equipment in that game? A muling place or a safe? What I would really want would be my own apartement with a weapon rack and a nice large walk-in wardrobe!<br>

Anybody know if they plan on fixing this before it comes out or if they will end up pulling a DiabloII with the game?  As for AC I think I have hit my slump. I got back into EQ for a while but not gonna be able to get Aslynn up to 45 so I am currently working out some stuff RL. I havenm't quit by any means whatsoever but just taking a break from it. I still rarely see anybody on when I manage to have time to play so gets a lil boring nowdays. Anybody got times that they play converted to GMT?  its now 5pm here so that is 11am central time. Anyway thought I would let you guys know whats up. hopefully will see you all soon. <br>
  Also My hat is off to those of you who are now playing EQ, AC, and managing all the stuff in RL that you have. I am finding it pretty difficult. <br>

Yep, there's a bank, and everybody gets an apartment. You can also make copies of your key and give them to friends, so you could use an apartment like a clubhouse. The apartment is just a couple of empty rooms, but you can buy furnishings... for a small fortune. I almost bought a potted plant just so I'd have something in there, but I only had enough money for the plant or bullets, figured I'd be better off buying bullets instead.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

So it's bugged alot? It's the nature of beta I believe. If they are serious, they will keep it beta till they have fixed all those bugs. Dia will go in that world as soon as Ghar says it's ok. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6B8E23><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ugharadin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gharadin</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#5F9EA0>(6/19/01 9:24:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=585.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AO</span><hr size=1> LOL, all we need is a refrigerator and a stereo!!!<br>
<br>
Yeah, the beta is really buggy... but it is a beta after all! Still, I'd be very surprised if it doesn't have a lot of rough edges when it's released. They only plan on one more beta patch, and it's being released in a week no matter what. Right now the servers crash constantly, items disappear from inventory, quests are broken, and trade skills aren't even implemented.<br>
<br>
I keep playing it though. It's just darn fun! There's just so much stuff in this game, I still don't know what half of it does. Weapons and armor, spell formulas, implants and other gizmos, tons of trade skills, politics, apartments, furniture, even vehicles! There's even stores that sell nothing but designer fashions for wearing around town. <br>
<br>
The mission generators are especially cool. You go up to a machine, and it will generate a list of little quests for you, and tell you what the reward will be. Usually a weapon, spell formula, or piece of armor. If you don't like the rewards, just generate a new list. Once you pick a mission, it gives you a key, and a location shows up on your map. When you get there you'll find a door you can only go in if you have a key. Inside, you'll have your own private little random dungeon, with enemies and treasure chests. At the end will be something you have to do, and when you do you'll get the reward. I've gotten almost a complete set of matching armor this way. The machines generate solo and group missions. No more competing for kills in the citadel, woohoo!<br>
<br>
I'm guessing it's going to be a pretty rough release, but if they can get half this stuff working right, it should be very fun! <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showMessage?topicID=591.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showMessage?topicID=586.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=585.topic&index=7><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=585.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.threadControl?topicID=585.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=585.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=585.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub10.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="forgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral">General<option value="forgottentruthforeignlegionlinks">Links<option value="forgottentruthforeignlegionmembers">Members<option value="forgottentruthforeignlegionquotes">Quotes<option value="forgottentruthforeignlegionfrm4">Uber Loot</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#5F9EA0>- </font><a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bforgottentruthforeignlegion>Forgotten Truth Foreign Legion</a><font color=#5F9EA0> - </font><a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral>General</a> <font color=#5F9EA0> - </font><a href="http://ftfl.iwarp.com/index.html">Home</a><font color=#5F9EA0> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-677484" target="_blank" >
