size=1> Morrigu was born into the prominent F'Lok family, the daughter of powerful Wizards. A bright young child with green eyes like her mother, Tasriel, she was naturally adept at the magical arts. Her mother was the creator of the famed &quot;Ice Comet&quot; spell, and was killed in an assault on Kelethin in one of the first practical uses of this spell. Lady F'Lok took many Feir'Dal and Koada'Dal to their deaths before being slain by a Feir'Dal druid named Gaiean. Upon news of the failed assault reaching Neriak, Morrigu's father, the Lord Razran F'Lok, went into a catatonia of sorts. He can still be seen on the tower of the Wizard's guild, silent and randomly casting a spell here or there. Effectively orphaned at her tender age, her brother Antian took over her care in the hours he was not at his bank, counting his all-important money. Feeling abandoned by all around her, Morrigu forswore her education in the mystic arts. Leaving both the Wizards academy and her brother's care, and despising his company and ethics, Morrigu set out to become the most skilled slayer of men that she could. She vowed to one day put a knife in the back of the druid Gaeian and ALL his kind. During her studies of anatomy and testing her powers at striking living creatures, her eyes shifted their color from green to blood red (seemingly the hate inside of her has made other physiological changes, but she rarely holds still for examination or documentation of these changes). Morrigu lives to see the day that all other breeds of elves are yoked in slavery under the Teir'Dal and other Dark Races.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/utheredhand.showPublicProfile>TheRedhand</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br>   <font color=#939393>(3/24/00 12:11:46 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> A home at last!</span><hr size=1> At long last, after leaving my Mad father and money-hungry brother, I have found a home for my restless spirit.

She reluctantly put down her pitcher of Kalish, then picked it backup and drained it before moving away from her table and out the door. She headed directly for the Oasis of Marr, where the EVENT was to take place. Upon her arrival in the oasis, she saw that the EVENT had already begun. Achren was speaking civilly and attempting to initiate a debate as to why the lightskins and the Dark Races warred constantly, but the speech was so thick it was a babble. She was jeered and insulted at every sentance. Morrigu polished her blades conspicuously, indicating a willingness to shut the mouths of those who were NOT her for debate. <br>
<br>
Shortly, Morrigu's old friend Xandriel arrived and made her presence known to Morrigu with a playful poke in the ribs. Xandriel was hidden and for a moment, even Morrigu's skills could not locate her, in the hot sun of the northern desert of Ro. Xan was becoming skilled indeed. Morrigu felt a swell of sisterly pride in her former guildmate. She clasped Xandriel's hand and savored the moment, knowing it might not come again soon. Passing a few bottles of Gypsy wine to Xandriel for refreshment, Morrigu's heart rejoiced for the first time in a long while. <br>
<br>
Very rapidly the challenges flew, and the Brother of her Blood, Kiros E'Kieron, accepted a duel from the Valorblade Rogue, Vankane. Vankane was a fellow rogue, and quick as any of his kind. Kiros was at a disadvantage for having chosen the Halberd as his weapon, but Kiros knew his own methods best. Vankane started off with a backstab and a flurry of short stabs, true to form for their profession. No assassin, like herself, but a worthy thief in his own right. Kiros recovered, and responded with heavy blows from his halberd. Then we all noticed a song filtering through the air, a soft, gentle melody accompanied by a blue aura that linked Vankane to a young bard from his guild. “Foul!” the Teir'Dal cried, only to be jeered by the lightskins. Kiros was eventually struck down by Vankane, with the assistance of the healing song from his bard. <br>
<br>
The talks degenerated more (truth to tell Morrigu was singlemindedly pursuing a duel with the reluctant bard to avenger her Brother's defeat) and eventually Achren and Mystere, both disgusted, left. <br>
<br>
Few indeed were left to represent the Teir'Dal. Before the eyes of her cousin Tholith the Necromancer, Furios the Human challenged Morrigu to duel, and she accepted upon his word that there would be no interferance. True to their word, Valorblade kept it clean, and the spectators did, too. The fight was largely one-sided, and at one point Morrigu stopped and asked Furios if he yielded to her. Morrigu enjoys little more than the shedding of blood, but there was a higher purpose here today. A proud member of the Knights of Valorblade, Furios declined the offer to cease and battled on. Morrigu bowed to him and dispatched him quickly. Then the Woodsie Rupert, the one with a loud mouth, challenged Morrigu instantly upon her victory. This battle was not so one-sided, and Rupert laned a few nice blows. Again, she asked her opponent if he yielded to her, and to his credit he did not. &quot;Never!&quot; he cried, and threw himself into the fray with a will. Morrigu concentrated on her actions and after a flurry of short blows, dispatched him also. She received a few more challenges, but made it clear her business was with Korie the wood elf bard who had interfered in Kiros' duel. <br>
<br>
Korie stepped up and with honor challenged Morrigu to fight. Morrigu was half-dead at this point and the question was raised among the mixed crowd whether she should be healed first, but the Assasin waved them off. If this young bard had honor and dignity enough to challenge her better to reclaim her good name, Morrigu would fight as she was, and let the Gods and her skill decide. Korie fought with skill and determination, landing several good strikes, and singing her songs at every opportunity. The Teir'Dal in the crowd cried &quot;Foul!&quot; again, but Morrigu announced that Korie was free to use all her skills to fight for her own honor. Towards the end of the battle, it was clear that Korie was going to die, and Morrigu backed away and gave her the chance to yield. A Knight of Valorblade ever, Korie chose the honorable way to repay her debt and did not yield. Morrigu battled her into unconciousness, and while the child slumbered, softly dispatched her with a blow to the spine. A fine opponent, and a woman of Honor and Dignity, Korie was. <br>
<br>
Morrigu stepped away from the battle, weary and grievously wounded, and sat down heavily. &quot;No More!&quot; she cried, &quot;I will slay no more of your clan tonight! Valorblade has proven themselves honorable indeed!&quot; A high elf woman stepped up to bandage Morrigu's wounds while a wood elf cast healing spells upon her. She had earned a modicum of respect for her race. Morrigu felt as if her chest would swell till it exploded… Innoruuk had smiled upon her, indeed. <br>

As a member of the prominent F'Lok family, she claimed a place in the richly coveted Third Gate by right of pure blood. <br>
The Obsidian Blade was becoming complacent, and her Blood-brother Kiros E'Kieron had begun to be frustrated with their lack of forward motion. Morrigu would have to speak with the Matron on this matter... <br>
Morrigu HATED politics, but she was born into them. She had to admit, she did love the outcome of political intrigue, which was usually either hired assasinations or war. Either way, Morrigu profitted in wealth or the sheer joy of bloodletting. Still... how long could a war against such clans as Valorblade last? Most light-skinned guilds recruited without much care for thequality of their members, and swelled their ranks with children who spoke in a near-incomprehensible jargon. And the light-skins themselves bred so quickly as to nearly crowd the rest of the world out by sheer force of numbers. Ah, the Teir'Dal were used to fighting as underdogs, though. <br>
Yet lately, Morrigu had witnessed a strange occurence in the Forest outside of Neriak. Young Teir'Dal with names that were clearly foreign, half-breeds who were in spirit and action more like unto the lightskins than their own blood-kin! <br>
Morrigu shook her head slowly and drew a heavy breath. This would be a long battle, indeed.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/utheredhand.showPublicProfile>TheRedhand</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br>   <font color=#939393>(3/24/00 12:18:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> An early tale in the Faydark Forest</span><hr size=1> During one of her characteristic drunken wanderings, Morrigu happened upon a <br>
quiet patch of forest where a young <br>
Feir'Dal girl sat playing a battered lute. The wood-elf child looked up at <br>
Morrigu's quiet approach. &quot;Oh! Hello!&quot; She said, <br>
only slightly taken aback at the sight of a dark elf in these most sacred of <br>
woods. &quot;Would you like to do the Bards a favor <br>
and deliver some ma.....&quot; the words abruptly ceased as she looked closer at <br>
Morrigu. &quot;Umm...do I know you, friend? You <br>
seem familiar..perhaps we have met...?&quot; <br>
<br>
Morrigu chuckled quietly, knowing that her bounty had been posted in many <br>
cities on Faydwer for her &quot;atrocities&quot; to the Feir'Dal race. &quot;Those <br>
blood-red eyes...that scar upon your shoulder...you're the Redhand!!!&quot; the <br>
little Feir'Dal squeaked, and grabbing her pack, began running as fast as <br>
her songs could speed her along, shrieking for the guards. &quot;This won't do at <br>
all&quot; thought Morrigu, and slipped quietly into the trees, practicing her <br>
newly learned shadow-stepping skills. <br>
<br>
Soon the young wood-elf ran directly into a wall of blue corded muscle and <br>
cold hate. The forest was quickly silent of <br>
both song and shrieks. Digging through the girl's personal effects, Morrigu <br>
found a rolled parchment, which read so: <br>
<br>
&quot;A song composed for the event of my own death: <br>
<br>
'Under Veeshan's starry sky, <br>
dig the grave where I'll softly lie. <br>
For Tunare I lived, and gladly died, <br>
and played my songs for others. <br>
<br>
This be the verse you sing for me, <br>
'Here she lies, where she longed to be <br>
Home the singer, ever free, <br>
And the daughter home to the Mother' <br>
<br>
Calliope Winddancer&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Hmmm...&quot; thought Morrigu, &quot;quite a nice tune there&quot;. She arranged the girls <br>
body in a face-down position on the forest <br>
floor, scattering bits of sweetmeats to attract the scavengers of the <br>
forest. There was no way she would waste the effort to <br>
dig this girl her grave...besides, the guards of the nearby city would <br>
surely get a delightful shock at seeing the girl's half-eaten body <br>
lying there. A pleasant thought indeed. She pulled off the glove from her <br>
right hand and stuffed it just inside the boot of the <br>
girl. The bit of crimson silk should stay put despite the best efforts of <br>
hungry wolves, and would serve as a nice reminder <br>
that Morrigu went wherever she damn well pleased. She picked up the girl's <br>
lute, and scarce valuables, and moved on, <br>
humming a strange haunting little tune to herself all the way back to the <br>
Dwarven mountains and the boat home. <br>

Morrigu paces the floor in the F'Lok house in the Third Gate area of Neriak. Her two older brothers, Antian and Drav, are both seeing to their assigned duties while performing their professional roles. Antian, being eldest, was at first reluctant to release the reigns of power for the house to Morrigu. After all, she WAS younger by several decades. A demonstration of her Will had been necessary to send him scuttling obediantly back to his vault to count the money he kept for others. It was not as if she were ungrateful for all those years he spent raising her, she just needed him to show some strength of purpose. Drav, owever, had political aspirations and was happy to see a strong woman at the head of the household again, it earned him respect in his job as a city guard, even if his sister was younger than he. <br>
<br>
Things had been strange for her since returning to the house she had grown up in. She had no time at all now, what with her house duties and political hobnobbing, to visit that noisy bar in the Foreign Quarter she had become so fond of. Of course her spies still maintained a drop-off there, and information was pouring in from all sides, with one conspicous gap in her information network. Hmm... <br>
<br>
She no longer took commisions for assassination, she now managed those requests as a collateral duty to her house. Teir'Dal she had been paid by before now work FOR her. It was a satisfying time, in theory. So why didn't she FEEL fulfilled? A faint twinge ran through her when she thought of her first days with House D'Fral, her TRUE family. A fine time, all bloodlust and killing and carousing. Things had gotten so...serious lately. She sighed as she shifted her weight again, spinning around to pace through another part of the almost-unfamiliar house. The mantle of authority weighed heavy on her, and she looked forward to the day she could turn it over to another. But not yet. Not until one more worthy came from within her own house. <br>
<br>
She signalled to a nearby houseslave, and ordered a tray of sweetmeats to be sent to her Father's feet in the Neriak Commons, atop the Wizard's tower. Razran was never seen to speak or eat, but food set before him would eventually disappear. She wondered if he would EVER come back to himself, or if he would be fully and truly mad till the end of his days, pining for Tasriel until he one day just faded from the world. <br>
<br>
Ahh, and the Wizards... they had been most keen to have her return to her studies with them now that she had taken control of her house. They spoke to her of their pride in her Mother's abilities, and how Morrigu so resembled the great Tasriel F'Lok. No doubt they merely wanted a Wizard of their guild, no matter her caliber, to hold some political standing in the community. No, she would not return to the studies of her early days. But she WAS picking a few things up, already a new, albeit weak, power came to her on occasion. She had discovered a strange form of magic, a seeming mix of her old basic spells from the Wizard's academy and her physical tension before an attack. She would have to devote some time in the tower to cultivating this, all things might one day be useful. <br>
<br>
She took a sip of the Neriak Nectar a slave brought her, and silently wished it were Kalish. But that barbarian swill would never be seen inside of this house, and even as Matron of House F'Lok, she could not break against the mores and traditions. ESPECIALLY as Matron... <br>
<br>
A soft sigh escaped her lips, and she realized that if she did not release some of this tension she would become useless to her House AND to the Obsidian Blade. Morrigu smiled widely. Yes, just the excuse she needed... She would go and hunt awhile, to relieve the stress she felt here. She called for a slave and penned a quicknot to her brothers, sealing it with the house crest on her ring. <br>
Off to the hunt... <br>

Many changes... She felt the burden of being the Matron of Family F'Lok acutely. Still...a fresh blade had been added to the struggle. She was relieved to finally have one she could trust as her lieutenant, as her chief of spies. Unbeknownst to either her brothers in Family F'Lok or her friends in the Obsidian Blade, she had taken on an assistant. Her Unseen Blade was one who moved like a silent breeze through the night, and carried Morrigu's authority to act as might be seen fit. It relieved Morrigu of much of the burden of managing such a huge information network, and also gave her a card hidden in her sleeve. A very Wild card.... <br>
A houseslave came in, announcing the arrival of her guest. A glass of Neriak Nectar was poured just as her Unseen Blade entered. &quot;Good day to you, (name deleted just to tick you all off)&quot;, Morrigu said. &quot;Will you sup with me?&quot;. She and her visitor moved to the table and sat, not at opposite ends as protocol would dictate, but at adjacent corners like old friends. Houselaves continuously brough such delicacies as pate of Feir'Dal liver, Gnome finger sandwiches and Morrigu's favorite (but quite gouche) dish of Pickled Halfling toes. <br>
They talked long into the night, discussing events of Norrath, the state of the Teir'Dal nation, and other things. Morrigu told her Hidden Blade of the two cousins she had recently ordered the City Council of Neriak to appoint to the ranks of the city guards. The even discussed the salary to be paid as a head of Morrigu's inner staff. <br>
Toward the dawn, Morrigu bid her lieutenant a fond farewell and retired for some much-needed sleep. Her recent efforts on several fronts had worn her out. <br>
Unable to sleep, she lay tossing on magnificent spider-silk sheets on her huge bed in the Matron's chambers. Morrigu reflected on her life, and found that she was not at all where she had planned. Always shying away from politics and power as a child, she had preferred to sport with other children at games of strength and skill. She had even relished her studies in her early childhood at the Wizard's academy, where all the elders assured her parents that she would meet or exceed their legacy to the arts. But this life was so....not at all what she had forseen. She longed for the days following her abandonment of her family, where she had made her way as a poor street-urchin working for the Ebon Mask. She had felt so at home there. And later, when she had been accepted into the House D'Fral, the Obsidian Blade, she had known kinship like never before. But many of those were gone now, and she had had to step up to sit on the Blade's council. <br>
She spared a few moments on all of this, and then her thoughts drifted to her mrann d'ssinss, Kaelin. Word had reached her that he was in a far-off land, and not at all well. Perhaps she would have to put everything here away for awhile, and do something about that...Perhaps... <br>
Morrigu drifted of finally to blissful slumber <br>

In a long string of sparring matches, she had been bested by only two opponents; Her brother Kiros, and Dantrazz W'Rath. The battle with Kiros had been closer, and has she been using poisoned blades it would have been decidedly in her favor. The battle with Dantrazz had been different. Only once before has she fought so hard to win a battle. As she saw herself slowly losing to Dan's mighty blows, she felt something inside of her yielding to him. She fought no less valiantly, in fact she frantically scrabbled to turn the tide of the conflict. But something inside of her was releasing itself to this man, who drew her attention and intrest. <br>
<br>
Later, during the Council meeting, she had excused herself to fetch a gift for the newest rogue in the house Javaan, the house of the snake. Isildark had been promised a guilding gift from the leader of his house, and with her absence she had neglected him. Making her way back to the council meeting, she had been tasked by Kiros to invite Brenya to join the Obsidian Blade. Her heart had frozen at the name, but she conducted her duty, and welcomed Brenya with open arms, heart breaking the entire time. <br>
<br>
After the battle for Dantrazz' freedom, she had been in a state of shock. She knew he had fought for himself, and had not chosen her over Brenya. But something inside of her rejoiced at his strength, his nobility. If any among the Teir'Dal deserved to live free, it was Dantrazz W'Rath. They had talked long into the night, and she had enjoyed his company. His kiss had taken her by surprise, but was by no means unwelcome. <br>
<br>
As she finished her duties in the household of F'Lok and began to prepare to retire for the evening, her thoughts drifted to him. He was so...perfect for her in every way. Too many coincidences. The assassin and politician in her reared their heads and screamed that she was being drawn into a trap. There were to many coincidences, the timing was too perfect. They had a common enemy in Lokus, they both loved to wander the region of lake Rathetear and admire the beauty there, they both had debts to pay in blood...and they both recognized a sickness within the Teir'Dal society. Was she paranoid enough to believe she was being set up to take a tremendous fall? Or was there something else to this, something even more important than her wealth and status within the city? Something without which life of any kind had no purpose... <br>
<br>
She quickly put such thoughts out of her head. If this be a trap, she would walk into it with open arms. Jala cahallin xal tlu elg'cahlin (any food may be poison) had been a principle she had lived by for too long. A life in fear of shadows was no life at all. <br>
<br>
And so, in her release from the worries of status, wealth and life, Morrigu also had found her freedom. What will be, will be. <br>

The &quot;cell&quot; could more adequately be described as an upright sarcophagus, measuring a mere 2 and a half feet both front to rear and side to side and barely giving her room to keep her head inclined in it's heigth. She had recieved neither food nor drink in the last 3 days of her captivity. Her heart rate was slow, her breathing shallow and measured. As she continued to press against the walls of her prison in order to keep her muscles toned for the moment of her release, she reflected upon the events of three days ago. <br>
<br>
She had been at the Arena with Dantrazz, Trucid, Oifur, Kiros and others of the Blade. Gaelwyn had been asking Trucid to come with him to study with some ridiculous lightdwelling druid. How utterly absurd! When Trucid had been hesitant in her denouncing of his plan, Kiros stepped in appropriately heavy-handed. Morrigu had hovered just behind Gaelwyn, ready to cripple him with her slim stiletto. Eventually, words had turned to actions and she and her comrades found themselves facing a cadre of lightcrawlers, to include Lanneth and Erelas. Dnasiha was there, rabble rousing and striding the fence between the purity of her race and the decadence of the pinkies, as usual. Morrigu had been knocked unconcious by a bolt from the hands of Erelas. <br>
<br>
When she returned to her senses, she saw Natashia there. Laughing to herself, she knew the time was right for this issue to be settled. No woman would have designs on Dantrazz. Morrigu herself often struggled to control her own desires to order his life in acordance with hers, but she had learned that he was much more of a treasure when left free. And here was this woman, who dared to claim that Dantrazz W'Rath would be hers. Eyeing the Necromancer, Morrigu quickly went through her equipment and discarded the idea of using poisons on her. Morrigu knew that if she killed Natashia, it would only foster doubt in the eyes of the man she loved. She would have to trust that Natashia's plans were as her spies had told her. If she could not trust the information coming from her family's network, then she would be dead soon one way or another. <br>
<br>
She hissed a threat at Natashia, and the two began to duel with little breath wasted on any more words. Morrigu opened with a flury of blows, disrupting nearly every spell Natashia was weaving against her. Natashia rallied, leaching the life from Morrigu and stunning her long enough to call upon her shadow-stepping abilities. From that point on, Morrigu had a very hard time catching Natashia to land more than a few glancing blows. I was over in a matter of four our five spells, with Morrigu writhing on the floor of the Arena in agony such as she had not felt since her sparring sessions with her friend Mystere. As she felt the awareness slipping from her, she pulled off one of her silk gloves. dropping it to the floor of the Arena, she brushed sand over it and released herself to the soothing embrace of unconciousness. <br>
<br>
When she awakened, she found herself trapped in this tiny prison cell. Unable to move more than a few inces in any direction, she had calmed her spirit and begun her vigil. And for three days she had tensed and relaxed her muscles in a rythmic motion, gently willing her body to stay in form for the moment one of her captors dared to release her (even if only to kill her). She had been stripped of her weapons and armor, but was not without resources. Her entire body was a lethal tool, honed to perfection in the art of killing. <br>
<br>
A sound approaching broke her from her reverie. The first she had heard in all this time, a single man's footsteps were approaching through a twisted series of hallways. Morrigu breathed a long, shallow breath and relaxed her body, appearing as if she had passed out from dehydration and hunger. The sound of a key fitting into a series of locks, five in all. They were truly afraid of her. &quot;Good&quot;, Morrigu thought to herself. &quot;They should be.&quot; The sound of chains sliding across stone, and a crack of light appeared. Morrigu held her body completely still. The crack widened into a blinding shower of brilliant light, and Morrigu moved like a snake. Blind as a cave bat, she grabbed her jailer's weapon hand and locked onto his wrist, bringing her other hand to his throat to prevent a cry that might rouse the other guards. As the surprised Teir'Dal realized what was happenning his reflexes struck out at her, but he was already dead. Morrigu had crushed his windpipe with her right hand and brought his weapon hand in toward herself, using his own thrust at her abdomen. She brought the arm across the edge of the sarcophagus, cleanly breaking the bones. As the dead man's grip relaxed, Morrigu plucked the dagger from his grasp and stepped into the light. She listened for the sound of more footsteps. but heard none. <br>
<br>
Morrigu took a moment to gather her belongings and take a small sip of water. She let her eyes adjust to the light of the lantern-lit hallway before her, and then padded silently out. The place was one she recognised. The Third Gate of Neriak, deeper than she usually chose to go into the Old Quarter. Morrigu encountered four more guards making her way out into the city. They didn't slow her down much, and they made no sound as they died. <br>
<br>
Morrigu knew that Natashia's plan had been to merely get her out of the way long enough to strike up a consoling affair with Dantrazz. But Natashia had made a horrible mistake... Morrigu knew that this heinous act would reach the ears of her lover, and knew also that Dantrazz would never again look at Natashia with anythiing but hatred and rage. Natashia had stepped into a landmine in Dantrazz' mind laid years ago, with the disappearance of his previous lovers.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/utheredhand.showPublicProfile>TheRedhand</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br>   <font color=#939393>(3/24/00 12:24:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Paying the Piper, Pt.

As soon as Morrigu set foot inside the lizard temple of Cazic Thule, word reached her that suring her absence a nameless wood elf had abducted Dantrazz. The bouncers outside of Oggok shivered as they heard a cold and blood-curdling scream pierce the air. Flying into a rage, Morrigu focused her will and was surrounded by a blood-red aura. She ran directly to the wizards pyramid at the heart of the temple's labyrinth, attracting the attention of a horde of lizards on her way there. As the blows rained down upon her, she concentrated on the person she had sworn fealty to and sent her thought with a desperationthat had nothing to do with the attack of the lizards hissing swarming around her. &quot;QUELUI!!!! My Matron, I need thee!&quot; <br>
Deep in the Third Gate of Neriak, Quelui S'Renn sat and studied a newly-aquired text in her quarters. As Morrigu's thoughts came to her she shot up, papers flying everywhere. She immediately knew the location from whence her Hand was crying out to her. With a small gesture of her hands she departed for Cazic Thule. Upon her arrival at the portal, she blinked twice to clear her eyes and gaped at the sight she saw. Very nearly a mountain of lizard corpses were accumulating, and Morrigu was fighting a pitched battle to keep the portal clear of live creatures so that Quelui would have a safe arrival. Out of the corner of her eye, Morrigu saw Quelui's arrival and exhaled a short breath of relief as she gutted another of the seemingly endless lizards. &quot;To the Faydark, quickly!&quot; she cried, and moved in close to Quelui. Not questioning the gravity of the situation, Quelui immendiately began weaving her magicks, and the two dissaappeared in a flurry of light. <br>
Arriving in the greater Faydark forest Morrigu immediately kneeled down (ostensibly to pay homage to her Matron, but mostly because of her utter exhaustion), gasped a deep breath of air and thanked her Matron. She then proceeded to fill Quelui in on the sketchy information she had recieved so far. &quot;And now, Matron, I must get to work. I think that you will not want to be here when I begin...&quot; Noting the cold, dead eyes in Morrigu's face, Quelui nodded briefly and gave her friend as much magickal assistance as she could before stepping back into the portal to go home. <br>
Once alone, Morrigu's jaw set and she began her work...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/utheredhand.showPublicProfile>TheRedhand</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br>   <font color=#939393>(3/24/00 12:25:06 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Paying the Piper, Pt.

Running through the Faydark forest, Morrigu alternated between shouting threats and offering cajolements. She was trying to locate the Wood elf she had heard was involved with her Beloved's abduction. A curious young Feir'Dal approached her. &quot;Why do you make such noise, Dark one? or forest is peaceful and serene. To what end do you cause such a disturbance?&quot; Morrigu wasted no breath on insults and immediately began to terrorize and interrogate the wood elf. Unsatisfied with the information she was recieving, the killing soon began... <br>
<br>
Some few hours and nearly two dozen Feir'Dal bodies later, Morrigu had a name. A name with no family, and few friends it seemed. Kerrina was the bard who had departed to Antonica with designs on Dantrazz W'Rath. Another choice bit of information had been garnered her family's network of spies: Kerrina had been hunting with Lokus and Sensi. Ahh... thought Morrigu, that is so very perfect. In one swoop she could eliminate the hated &quot;spurned&quot; Lokus, his bride, and a foolish young bard who thought that she could claim Dantrazz as a prize. Morrigu made her way to the docks, and boarded the boat for Freeport. She was now calm and confident in the knowledge that she could handle this situation. <br>
<br>
Upon her arrival in Freeport, Morrigu skirted the areas of the town where her quiet and sneaking form might draw unwanted attention. Even she and her band of assassins and spies had places they could not tread, places that meant sure death. And while Morrigu was sure that she would die to save Dantrazz, she was equally sure she would and could not die while his life may still hang in the balance. As she left Freeport behind her, a young apprentice from the Punox family approached her. They secluded themselves in the shade of a nearby tree, and kept watch over each others' shoulders as they conversed in the cant of thieves. &quot;Redhand, a new item for you&quot;. &quot;What is it?&quot; Morrigu hissed impatiently. &quot;We have located the Bard Sensi and the apostate Himself, and it is apparent that neither had anything at all to do with the abduction of Lord W'Rath&quot;. &quot;Are we sure of this?&quot; Morrigu was perplexed. It had all fit together so nicely in her mind. She had been planning her strategy the entire trip over the sea. &quot;Damn...&quot; she whispered &quot;And what of this Kerrina?&quot;. &quot;Of her, Redhand, we have found no trace at all. There is not the slightest sign of either her or Lord W'Rath. Not a bent blade of grass, nor a whisper of a scent. Nothing....we are stymied.&quot; The young Punox visibly tensed as he delivered his report, ready for Morrigu's famous temper to display itself at his expense. But Morrigu was not full of rage. She was fighting her lungs to draw a breath. Her stomach was tying itself in knots, and no amount of control she tried to exercise could stop her panic. &quot;Th..thank you, young one...you are dismissed. Please keep me apprised&quot;. &quot;Mistress, would you li..&quot; &quot;I said GO!!!&quot; Morrigu roared, and the boy scuttled away with preternatural speed, to disappear into the Nektulos forest. Gathering her strength and her nerves, Morrigu began to make her best possible speed to a place she rarely went, and to the person she knew she would find there. Morrigu went to find Sensi.... <br>

<br>
In the Northern plains of Karana, Sensi stood shocked at the sight before her. Here was the woman who had sworn to kill her husband at any time and place of his choosing, with the temerity to approach her as a supplicant seeking assistance. <br>
<br>
&quot;Good day to you, Lady Morrigu, and what is it that you seek?&quot; Sensi asked sweetly, her mind feverishly turning and seeking to make sense of this situation. <br>
<br>
Morrigu maintained rigid composure in front of the Feir'Dal. Her nostrils screamed to flair at the acrid stench of the woman's flesh and sweat, but she remained placid and cool on the exterior. Sensi, I come to you about a mutual loved one, and I seek your assistance to assure his safety...&quot; Morrigu then proceeded to give Sensi all the information she had available, including the link she had learned of between Kerrina and Sensi. <br>
<br>
&quot;This Kerrina is not truly a friend of ours, you have to understand, Morrigu&quot; Sensi said delicately. <br>
<br>
&quot;Then what exactly is she to you, and do you hold any sway at all over her?&quot; Morrigu asked, eager for this whole painful affair to be over and have Sensi set in her task. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; Sensi replied, &quot;she is more of a...fan. She rather idolizes Lokus and I: Sensi looked embarassed at the admission. &quot;What is it exactly you wish for me to do?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot; I do not care what you do, or what means you use to do it. I want Dantrazz back, and I want...&quot; Morrigu's cold facade began to crack. Her voice trembled, and she fought to keep the world around her from spinning crazily. &quot; I WANT for you to find this woman and force her or convince her to release Dantrazz unharmed&quot; Morrigu stated with strength returning to her voice. She eyed Sensi with her well-practiced usual method of intimidating others. <br>
<br>
Sensi looked unfazed by the glare. She did, however, seem concerned about the situation. &quot;Oh, dear&quot; she sighed. &quot;Poor Kerrina...Iwonder what she thinks she is doing.&quot; Sensi shook her head slightly. &quot;So, Morrigu, you wish tyo have your possession returned to you? You are offended that someone else overwrote your designs for Dantrazz, and caged him before you could?&quot; Sensi raised an eyebrow at Morrigu. Sensi was getting to be a better judge of Teir'Dal body language because of her time with Lokus. If her assessment was right, Morrigu's purple complexion and distended throat and forehead veins meant she was only a few moments away from apoplexy. <br>
<br>
&quot;Cage him? I?!? Cage Dantrazz W'Rath?&quot; Morrigu shouted. &quot;I would sooner kill him! Dan is who he is because he has his freedom! Few Teir'Dal earn that! Dan is...&quot; Morrigu trailed off. Her strength departed her, and she crumbled before the wife of her enemy. &quot;Dan is...my light....he is my...salvation....&quot; Sobs wracked her tiny frame, and for the first time, Sensi saw her not as an assassin with the blood of hundreds on her hands, but as a woman. A woman whose life hung in the balance. &quot;Please, Sensi...please, help me to find him. I am so lost without him. Please...&quot; Morrigu's voice dwindled into a tiny whisper. &quot; I will do anything for him. Anything...&quot; <br>
<br>
The words struck Sensi's mind like the ringing of a gong. &quot;Please&quot;, &quot;Help me&quot; and &quot;Anything&quot; were not words she had ever expected to hear from the woman she knew as Morrigu the Redhand. Her heart went out to Morrigu. And yet, at the same time, a thought occured to her. &quot;Anything, eh? And what if the price I name for my help is too costly for you?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;There is no price too costly for this, Sensi...whatever you ask of me, it shall be done.&quot; Morrigu regained control of herself, sensing that Sensi was willing to help her, but hesitant at what the cost might be. Her wealth? Her status in Teir'Dal society? Her House? Her place in the Blade? All these possibilities passed before Morrigu, and each one was met with approval. Whatever Sensi asked, she would do it. There was no question in her mind. <br>
<br>
&quot;Morrigu, I have never asked you the reason for your vendetta against my husband...&quot; Sensi began. &quot;I wonder, could we talk of it one day?&quot; <br>
<br>
Morrigu tensed at the mention of Lokus the reviled, the spurned. He who had turned away from nearly everything Teir'Dal. Everything except power. He was Teir'Dal to the core, but didn't even admit it to himself. He loved power, revelled in it, and yet he had cast filth upon all that his power had been based upon. <br>
<br>
&quot;And so I tell you now, my price is...&quot; Morrigu's eyes widened in horror as realisation dawned upon her of what Sensi's price would be. &quot;My price is that you leave my husband alone. You and all your servants and 'associates' will never harm him. Do you agree?&quot; <br>
<br>
Morrigu was trapped, and she knew it. There would be no bargaining about this matter. She could strike Sensi down and flee, she could refuse and proudly walk away, she could even locate Lokus and do what she pleased with him. But none of that would be of any help to Dantrazz. <br>
<br>
&quot;My Lady, it will be as you ask of me. Neither I nor any of my House will bring harm upon Lokus...&quot; Morrigu said. &quot;UNTIL such time as you release me from this geas.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Come then, Sensi said, preparing a travelling song to speed their way, Let us return to the most likely place. Your information is that she may deal with Shady to get Dan off Antonica? To the Commonlands, then!&quot; <br>
<br>
And with the gentle melody on the air, they sped off on their journey, together.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/utheredhand.showPublicProfile>TheRedhand</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br>   <font color=#939393>(3/24/00 12:37:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paying the Piper, Pt. III - Sensi's tale</span><hr size=1> Sensi bit her lip, confused at what she saw before her. Here was Morrigu... an assassin, a person who she had known to cause nothing but pain to others... here she was, tears streaming down her face, torn apart because of her love for a dear friend of Sensi's. <br>
<br>
She shook her head, and tried to maintain a cool exterior, but inside, she was reeling for what she saw before her. Here was one of her husband's greatest enemies... and she seemed nothing more than a simple woman, a woman like her, whose life had been torn apart because of a simple, young Fier'dal bard's intentions towards her man. <br>
<br>
She barely noticed as she and Morrigu arrived at Shady's. She asked Morrigu to leave before Kerrina showed up... she had her oath. Upon Morrigu's love, upon her honour and her house, she would not harm her husband. This was more than enough for Sensi to feel incredibly different about the woman before her. <br>
<br>
She knew what Morrigu wanted of her... to force Kerrina to tell her what had happened to Dantrazz. But Sensi knew that force would be completely out of the question here... she was dealing with a child. A child of fourteen, who could barely understand the consequences of her actions. A child who had deserved a better life... and Sensi felt deeply responsible for that. <br>
<br>
Humming a quiet tune to herself, her vision brightened and the features of the room stood out in sharp relief. Smiling, she wondered if the Tier'dal really realized what an incredibly gift for vision they had. She watched Morrigu leave the room, and then nodded to herself as she saw her shadow return, sneaking up close to the fire beside Sensi and the standoffish merchant. So her trust extended only so far... Sensi could understand that. <br>
<br>
Presently, she saw Kerrina make her way to the merchant, obviously nervous. Sensi stepped out of the shadows, grateful to have this small gift left behind after her years darting around the shadows of the Faydark. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hello, dear. I've heard you haven't been a very good girl lately.&quot; Sensi spoke gently, comfortingly. <br>
<br>
Kerrina started at the sudden intrusion to her work, obviously surprised to find Sensi there. She stuck out her lower lip and whispered, &quot;I haven't been a very good girl,&quot; tears brimming in her eyes. <br>
<br>
Sensi smiled gently and took Kerrina's hand. &quot;Tell me all about it, dear. I'd like to see this set right.&quot; Mindful of Morrigu's presence so close, she switched to the Elven tongue and kept her conversation very muted. <br>
<br>
&quot;You... you remember Elkrar, do you not?&quot; Kerrina asked Sensi. Sensi nodded silently, a cast of sadness coming about her features. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well... she's very sick, Sensi. The same thing that took her parents... she may not have much time left.&quot; <br>
<br>
Sensi winced at the news, remembering the good times she had had with one of the few Fier'dal she was happy to call friend. &quot;I'm incredibly sorry to hear that, dear, but.. what does that have to do with Dantrazz and Morrigu?&quot; <br>
<br>
Kerrina chewed her lower lip, looking all of her tender age at that moment. &quot;I thought... with Dantrazz and Elkrar's past... she would have liked to see him. But I didn't think Morrigu would ever accept that... would ever let that happen.&quot; <br>
<br>
Sensi blinked back tears, moved by the little bard's intentions, if not her methods. &quot;Yes, dear, I'm sure she would love to see him... but don't you think you should have let Morrigu and Dantrazz work that out for themselves? I'm sure that if it was something he desired, she wouldn't stand in his way.&quot; <br>
<br>
Kerrina nodded sullenly. &quot;I... I didn't think it out so well, I guess. I thought I was doing the right thing.&quot; <br>
<br>
Sensi smiled at the young Fier'dal, seeming the mature elder outwardly, but wishing to scream inwardly. She could see herself... shaking her head, she moved on to the topic at hand. &quot;What did you do with Dantrazz, dear?&quot; Her smile was kind, yet firm. <br>
<br>
Kerrina pouted harder. &quot;I... I put something in his honey mead. He's... he's over in those crates over in the corner.&quot; Giggling a little, she said, &quot;I thought it would be difficult to put an alert and very strong Tier'dal in one.&quot; <br>
<br>
Nodding, Sensi whispered, &quot;I'll make this right, sweetie. I'll try to protect you from Morrigu.. but she's incredibly upset, and I don't think without reason. Best you leave before she shows up.&quot; <br>
<br>
A brief flash of fear went through Kerrina's eyes, and she began to speed off... just a muttered, &quot;Tell her I'm sorry,&quot; left behind in the humid air. <br>
<br>
Turning to address Morrigu directly, Sensi smiled at the Tier'dal rogue, who was obviously startled at Sensi's knowledge of her presence. <br>
<br>
&quot;You'll find your love in those crates in the corner. I'm sorry this happened.. and I can't say I don't empathize with Kerrina's motives, if not her actions. Dantrazz's first fiancee... a Fier'dal druid, and a dear friend of mine.. lies dying in Kelethin. Kerrina took it upon herself to bring Elkrar a brief moment of happiness in her last days. She is sorry she handled this so inappropriately. I just think she should have consulted the two of you about it instead of pouring a potion into his mead. I will trust that you will tell him of this, and he and you can deal with it directly. And I trust that you will honour our agreement.&quot; <br>
<br>
Sensi unslung her drum from her shoulder and began to speed off down the tunnel towards the Commonlands. She smiled slightly to herself as she heard Morrigu's exclimation of happiness and Dantrazz's muted, drugged questions before her speed carried her out of earshot and into the sunshine that was just cresting above the mountains.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#939393>- </font><a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bshadowsoftheblade>House W'Rath</a><font color=#939393> - </font><a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fshadowsofthebladecharacterstoriesbackgroundsandsuch>Character Stories (Backgrounds and Such)</a> <font color=#939393> - </font><a href="http://members.home.net/sbugelli">House W'Rath Common Hall</a><font color=#939393> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
