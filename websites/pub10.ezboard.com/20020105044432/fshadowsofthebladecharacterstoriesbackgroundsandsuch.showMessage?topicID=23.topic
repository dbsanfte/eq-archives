<br>
<br>
Some may find me cold as steel, ruthless even. In battle, that is true. The<br>
rage one will see burn within me springs forth from the fountain of my youth.<br>
Let me fill you in.<br>
<br>
My parents were a typical Teir'Dal family of the moderate means and much<br>
love. My childhood was one filled with laughter and, oh, yes, fishing....a<br>
favorite activity of mine. Our cottage in 3rd Gate was a fantasy-filled abode<br>
for this youngster.<br>
<br>
Father was a Rogue. I recall his departures vividly each time he set out on his<br>
&quot;missions&quot;. Mother was the finest crafter of silks and hides...a tailor everyone<br>
in Neriak envied.<br>
<br>
After several &quot;missions&quot;, Father's demeanor began to change. I wasn't quite sure<br>
what was going on, I only knew that our outings became fewer. The whispers <br>
of neighbors disturbed me, but I really couldn't fathom what was being said. <br>
<br>
One night, I heard mother crying and pleading with my father. &quot;No, don't do this<br>
to us,&quot; she cried. &quot;We must! So get ready,&quot; he retorted. &quot;We must leave in <br>
the morning.&quot;<br>
<br>
I recall being lifted from bed by my mother and told to hush and get dressed. My<br>
mother told me, with a weak smile on her lips, that we were going on a journey<br>
with Father. &quot;We'll have a wonderful time, you'll see,&quot; she whispered. That was<br>
all I needed to hear. I joyfully pulled together my favorite treasures.<br>
<br>
The next seven years that passed were the bleakest, most harrowing, fear-filled<br>
days I could ever imagine. It turns out my father was trying to fulfill a fantasy of<br>
obtaining riches and hiring out his services as a thief and spy. He dragged us <br>
along from town to town, travelling in shadows...in secret. Some days, we did<br>
not eat because we had to hide from the patrols of guards that would surely slay<br>
any Teir'Dal caught in the midst. How many nights, I cried....and I watched my<br>
mother cry.<br>
<br>
Oh, Father was living the good life...his life. The plat was flowing in, but it was<br>
never enough. On to the next &quot;mission&quot; he would go...dragging us along.<br>
<br>
And then one day, he'd had enough of my mother and me. We had become a<br>
burden to him...a drain on his lifestyle. We were hiding not too far from the port <br>
by Qeynos.<br>
<br>
He walked away. No farewell kiss, no smile, no hug. He had given my mother a <br>
bag of a hundred plat and walked away.<br>
<br>
&quot;Quickly, we must get out of here,&quot; she whispered and dragged me down to where<br>
a hole in the wall appeared. &quot;We can escape the city through here.&quot; <br>
<br>
Escape is what we did. Using some inborn skills, which I did not understand at <br>
that time, we scrambled along, avoiding the constant dangers about us. The journey<br>
to Neriak would take forever, I felt. Step by step, often sitting still hiding for hours,<br>
we made our way east towards home.<br>
<br>
I spent the whole trip terrfied of the things I saw. The monsters were formidable. <br>
I still remain thankful to the kindness of some Teir'Dal who gave us safe passage <br>
through some of the most creature-laden territories.<br>
<br>
Finally we made our way through the West Commonlands and crossed into the East<br>
Commonlands. My mother and I smiled for we could feel the end of the journey so<br>
near. We bounded up to the top of the next hill...and there they were. A pack of<br>
young kodiaks converged on us. Mother pushed me hard down the hill. &quot;Run!&quot; she<br>
cried, as she desperately fought off their onslaught.<br>
<br>
With tears in my eyes, I noticed a group of men in shiny armor. They had pale skin,<br>
but at the moment, it did not matter. <br>
<br>
&quot;Please, please! Help my mother. The bears are killing her! Please..now!&quot; I cried at<br>
the men. I froze in terror as they simply began to laugh.<br>
<br>
&quot;I bet she dies in two minutes,&quot; one of the humans cackled.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, no...she's tough...I bet she can last 5 minutes,&quot; retorted the dwarf.<br>
<br>
They pushed me aside so they could watch the carnage. It only took a few moments, <br>
and my mother fell. It was only then, that the light-skinned men got up and dispatched<br>
the beasts.<br>
<br>
I recall trying to cry, but the tears would not come. A hatred began to well up within<br>
me. It was at that moment, I heard Innoruuk's voice so clearly.<br>
<br>
I tasted of death that day. When I sadly returned to my empty cottage in 3rd gate,<br>
I headed to the guild of the undead, and at that moment, became Selilya the<br>
Necromancer. I poured all my energy into learning the craft. I headed into the forest<br>
to hunt down the creatures there. The creatures had no chance against my hatred.<br>
<br>
One evening as I was out &quot;training&quot;, I ran into one Nospiratus, who noticed the fury<br>
I unleashed against the forest vermin. He told me of the Harvest. A peace fell over <br>
me that day, for I found my home.<br>
<br>
Yea, I miss Mother. I follow in her steps to be a master tailor. I will always honor <br>
her memory, and yet.....one day I must face my father........<br>
<br>
