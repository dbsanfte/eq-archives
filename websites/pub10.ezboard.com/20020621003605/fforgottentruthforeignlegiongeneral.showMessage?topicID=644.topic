One thing to remember; it's almost impossible to screw up your character at low levels. You'd have to do something really stupid, like max pistol and dual-weild skills for 25 levels, and then decide to switch to assault rifles. &lt;Toe looks innocent and starts to whistle off-key&gt; And even that isn't really a disaster.<br>
<br>
Max all your abilities for the first 10-15 levels, but after a while you won't be able to afford to keep them all up. An Atrox should probably always max Str and Sta, slnce they're green and you'll want to look for armor that's based on those stats, like Omni-Pol. Try to max Agility because the assault rifle skill depends on it, Sense for ranged energy, and Body Dev for hit points. Put some points in Int because a lot of skills use it, and a little into Psy. Only raise Nano Pool as needed, we only have one or 2 nanos we need to cast in combat.<br>
<br>
Always max Assault Rifle and Ranged Energy; ARs are our weapon of choice, and the best ones are energy weapons. You'll need to keep Fling, Burst, and Full-Auto up, but near as I can tell you only need to get them high enough to meet the requirements on the weapons your using.<br>
<br>
Always max run speed; when you have a Hammer Breeder on your butt as you're crossing Lush Fields, you'll understand why! The other speed stuff is pretty contoversial, no 2 people say the same things. I'd say put some points into Ranged Init; it's not very noticeable, but at high levels you should see a difference in firing speed. As far as the evade stuff goes: some folks say it's useless if you have your aggresion slider set all the way to the right like we all do; some say they're useless unless you keep them close to max; and some say you're crazy to ignore them. You can probably max Dodge, Evade, and Nano Resist for a few levels at least, then decide. I still have no clue. You can ignore Duck, right now that only determines how much damage you take from trapped chests, and you'll have enough hp to take it on the chin. <br>
<br>
Get Elect Eng up to 36 so you can use night vision goggles and floating torches, then leave it alone. Max Comp Lit, you need it for grid access, and adding NCU capacity. Raise Psychology just enough to use any Aggression Enhancers you find; these work like EQ's taunt skill.<br>
<br>
Nanos... well, no one is gonna confuse an Atrox soldier with a nano-tech. Bottom line, only increase these to meet the reqs on a specific nano you want to use. The AC buffs, damage buffs, and reflect shields are useful. Total Mirror Shield used to be our bread &amp; butter, but it was badly nerfed last patch because it was being horribly exploited. Still pretty useful though I think, but others disagree. Besides the soldier specific nanos, there's also useful general nanos that anyone can use that can buff any skill by 10 and 20 points. Max First Aid so you can use the best kits possible, and keep Treatment high to keep down time to a minimum. <br>
<br>
Put some points in Concealment, but don't go nuts. We ain't exactly cat burglars. Get Breaking and Entering up to 30 or so, that seems to be enough to open all chests right now.<br>
<br>
And max Map Nav if you can. It will take a while before you can upload any useful maps, but you'll need them eventually. There's also some map upgrades you can buy; I always get the one that adds an arrow showing the direction you're facing on the map as soon as I can. <br>

For your normal gun, look for Nova Flows or E-Beamers. Novas are probably the best, but very rare. Beamers are almost as good (some say better), and much more common; that's what I've been using. A few people like the Rancho Colonial Carbine; it doesn't do as much damage as the other 2, but it doesn't require the Ranged Energy skill either, so you can save on IPs. BTW, I have a lonely QL 10 E-Beamer sitting in the bank waiting for a new owner.<br>
<br>
For your big gun, look for a GE Man-Portable Laser, Steiner, Flashpoint, or Westinghouse Plasma Burner. These are all really slow, but they do massive damage. The idea is to put both guns on your hotkey bar so you can switch between them quickly. Use the big gun to quickly fire a burst or full-auto, then switch to your regular gun for the rest of the fight while the special recycles. It used to take forever to recycle, so I would save my GE for emergencies, but since the last patch I can burst with it once almost every fight.<br>
<br>
The best place to get armor is by camping the mission generator, or buying it from other players. You can probably use anything starting out, but later you'll need to stay away from stuff that has Int or Psy reqs. I have a ton of armor banked if anyone needs it, but it's mostly stuff in the mid-teens and higher. <br>
<br>
The most important thing about chosing armor is to stay color-coordinated at all costs. The Omni-Tek Fashion Police have their hands full chasing down cross-dressing Atrox, they don't need any more headaches. Please people, always remember: fashion is everything. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=644.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=644.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=644.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=644.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.threadControl?topicID=644.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=644.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=644.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub10.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="forgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral">General<option value="forgottentruthforeignlegionlinks">Links<option value="forgottentruthforeignlegionmembers">Members<option value="forgottentruthforeignlegionquotes">Quotes<option value="forgottentruthforeignlegionfrm4">Uber Loot<option value="forgottentruthforeignlegionfrm5">AO Guild Notes<option value="forgottentruthforeignlegionfrm6">The Shop At Home Forum!</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#5F9EA0>- </font><a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bforgottentruthforeignlegion>Forgotten Truth Foreign Legion</a><font color=#5F9EA0> - </font><a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral>General</a> <font color=#5F9EA0> - </font><a href="http://www.forgottentruth.com">Home</a><font color=#5F9EA0> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
