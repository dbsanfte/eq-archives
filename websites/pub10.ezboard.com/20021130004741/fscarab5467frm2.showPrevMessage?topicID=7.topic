<br>
-------POINT WIPE SYSTEM-------<br>
<br>
I. DEFINITIONS<br>
RAID: Any cooperative grouping on a given zone/quest hit/etc. that constitutes of at minimum 10 players.<br>
RP: Raid Point.  This is the 'currency' of which loot can be 'purchased' with in SCARAB.<br>
RL: Raid Leader<br>
GL: Group Leader (assistants to RL)<br>
ML: Master Looter<br>
<br>
A. Point Rewarding<br>
<br>
Points are awarded on each raid based on a few criteria:<br>
<br>
I. You get 1 RP per 2 hours of any 'official' raid.  Rounded up.  Abuses of this merely to farm RPs will result in no RPs awarded.  Gains from a raid will be expected to live up to the RPs awarded.<br>
<br>
II. You get half the standard RPs for a given raid if you:<br>
--Come late<br>
--Leave early<br>
--Cause disturbance<br>
--Disobey RL and/or raid plans<br>
--Are caught AFKing too often and/or are not participating and doing your job<br>
It is ultimately up to the RL who is rewarded half, and if there are any extreme cases, who is awarded no points at all for a raid.  When someone is denied any points for a raid, the GLs and/or backup RLs etc will have to come to an agreement on this so as to not allow any given RL to abuse this 'responsibility'.<br>
<br>
III. On single-hit quest mobs (eg. EK druid/ranger fight, monk fists, etc) all present will be awarded 1 RP.<br>
<br>
IV. Points are awarded at the END of any raid/event.  Points awarded for any such raid/event cannot be used, thus, during said raid/event (because you wont actually have them yet).<br>
<br>
<br>
B. Point Deduction<br>
<br>
Point deduction is ultimately caused by looting, I am leaving most of this space intentionally blank for any unforeseen functionality that we wish to implement at a later time ;)<br>
<br>
However, point deduction is the product of:<br>
I. When a looted item is claimed by a raider, the raider's points are reset to 0.<br>
--If said raider has 10 points or more, then he/she will loose a solid flat 10 points inset of being reset to 0.<br>
<br>
<br>
C. Looting<br>
<br>
I. Looting items is done by claiming a dropped item based on how many points you have.<br>
<br>
II. Items may only be looted by those with POSITIVE RP's from PREVIOUS raids.  You will be required to know beforehand how many points you have on a raid.<br>
<br>
III. Dishonesty in reporting your true point value to the ML will result in decisive 'disciplinary' action taken against your membership in SCARAB.  Mistakes are allowable, lying is not.<br>
<br>
IV. When an item is dropped, the ML will link/shout out the item(s) in the raid channel (after all fighting is over and a 'loot up, rest up' pause is given).  Anyone who wishes, according to NBG, to claim the item will send the ML a tell with but two bits of info:<br>
/tell MasterLooter I want itemXXX, I have XX RPs.<br>
<br>
V. An item is claimed by the person desiring the item with the highest RPs.  Ties between players will result in the ML doing /random for all tied players and rewarding the winner of the roll said item.<br>
<br>
VI. As stated in point deduction, your points are reset to 0 upon claiming an item.  The 10 point restriction does of course apply.<br>
<br>
VII. Multiple items MAY be looted by the same person on a single raid, but in EACH loot claiming situation, the raider must meet ALL of the requirements associated with item looting.<br>
<br>
VIII. There will be no reserved looting.  THE exception to this rule is on quest mobs/quest hits that are completely organized solely for the intention of claiming a loot item for a given player.<br>
<br>
<br>
D. NO DROP Looting<br>
<br>
I. An item that is ND will be claimed as per the standard looting rules.<br>
<br>
II. In the situation that an ND item is not claimed by anyone, everyone present will have the option of claiming the item at the expense of gaining no RPs for the current raid.  Any further items looted in this way will be 'free' in the sense that the claiming player will still gain no RPs for the current raid.  example: oldworld planes armor, many pieces of it drop for a certain class that only 1 of is present during the raid.  in this case, this person will be allowed to loot all of it at the loss of gaining no RPs for the raid.<br>
Any multiple claims of an item for the 'cost' of gaining no RPs for the current raid will be resolved by the ML using /random.<br>
<br>
III. If an ND item is still unclaimed, it will be shouted out in the zone and anyone lucky enough to chance by will be allowed to loot it.  If this doesnt happen either, the item in question rots.<br>
<br>
<br>
E. Recruiting: SCARAB Mercenary Aid<br>
<br>
To recruit SCARAB's for quest mobs, help with quest hunting, or whatever else you have in mind, you must meet a few criteria:<br>
I. You must have positive points<br>
II. For every 3 SCARAB members recruited, you must have +1 RP, rounded up.  Thus, a full group (not including yourself) would cost you 2 RP.<br>
III. When recruiting for a certain task, any loot gained is at your sole discretion to be reserved.<br>
IV. Looting reserved items follows the same looting rules as per regular items.<br>
V. If 2 (or more) people present wish to do the same mob hit for their own quest advancement, then EACH person (including the first) must have a minimum of RP equal to the recruitment cost divided by the number of players wishing to get their quest loot.  This means that, for example, if there were 2 druids and a ranger present for the EK epic fight, and all 3 wanted to get that part done, they would all be required to reset points to 0, but would also all be required to have enough RPs to get their portion.  In the case that 2 full groups are recruited for 3 ppl: 12-3=9/3=3/3=1...its 12 ppl total, minus the 3 that are getting the loot, divided by 1 RP per 3 ppl recruited, divided by the 3 ppl getting loot (2 druids and a ranger). Thus, each of these players would need 1 RP to partake in this.  RPs in this situation are awarded according to the standard 1pt=2hours guideline (rounded up).  Thus said, it will be wise for players to do the same mob hits together, so they can share the cost of points. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bscarab5467.showUserPublicProfile?gid=boldir>boldir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(10/23/02 9:00:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fscarab5467frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: POINTS SYSTEM: POINT WIPE</span><hr size=1> A couple of queries.<br>
<br>
1. How are initiates treated?<br>
<br>
2. How are raids reported to the correct person to get RPs increased / decreased?  What about raids that are formed on an ad-hoc basis i.e. not announced on the boards?<br>
<br>
3. If we take an extreme of someone with 10 points.  That is the equivalent of 20 hours game play per item.  Isn't that rather alot and doesn't it encourage people to try to get items first on low points?<br>
<br>
Other than that I agree with everything.<br>
Cheers,<br>

<br>
2. Raid leader reports under scarab members and points, Who was in the raid, who got only 1 pt for raid(and reason), who looted items thereby the admins will update list.<br>
<br>
3. i am incilned to agree that 10 points is a bit much, considering that you have been on minimum 5 raids to get this points. <p>Sild Muffinhands,<br>

<br>
i thought i was crystal clear, oh well, here goes again (thanks for speaking up though):<br>
<br>
1. this point i didnt cover in the point system because it has nothing to do with point system.....how initiates are treated is a subject of the scarab rule system, which you can find in the rules thread......right now, initiates may not loot...with this point system, as stated, however, everyone will be reset to 0 points.  initiates WILL gain points on raids, however be unable to use them until they have either been on 3 raids, or gotten a total of 6 points (which is equivalent to 3 raids, for the most part)<br>
<br>
2. sild answered this one<br>
<br>
3. you need to reread this points system.  it states that the one with highest points wins an item out of all that wish to claim it, thus, most of the time, people wont even get 10 points or higher......this 10 point limit was set in so that for the rare occurance of somebody going on tons and tons of raids, yet never getting loot, and racking up alot of extra points, that they wont have to reset themselves all the way to 0 just to get an item that might drop (and might sure as hell not be worth all those points).....when writing the rules system up i at first put it at 8 points, and we might revert to that if the system tends to make people rack up lots and lots of extra points (the thing that needs to be done to prevent this is that people actually spend their points.....'waiting' and 'waiting' and 'waiting' for that uber drop, isnt going to ensure youll get it, so spend the points you have to spend, even if it might be on something to sell.....its your points, your time, your effort, might as well get something for it.  a healthy economy cannot exist without any consumers ;) )<br>
<br>
right now the point system is going to be a little more strict then i had planned, this is to keep in line with our rule #2 (or was it #3?) which says:<br>
a point system cannot reward more points then can be spent......that said, even with the 10 point limit, it is possible that more points can be awarded then we would ever possibly get loot to spend it on......so for right now, 1pt = 2 hours, and on an average raid you would get 2pts......we are rounding the time on the raid up, so a 3 hour raid would still get you 2pts.....a 2:30h raid would still get you 2pts, but less then that i think should be 'absorbed' into the 2h type of raid......also, the amount of time it takes for certain raids will, over time, be developed and will be used as a standard......so after 10 kael raids (as an example), we'll take the average time spent, divide the hours by 2, and that will be the fixed amount of points for that specific kael raid from then on out......this way we have fixed RP rewards for each raid, and not each item.....<br>
<br>
also, i missed one thing, and that is: max # of RP that can be gained from a raid is 4. thats alot of points for a single raid, and its 8 hours, which is enough to do any zone in the game far as i know... <p><HR>

<br>
quest drops can be rolled on......<br>
after that, ppl that didnt get anything will have points, those that got something will just not get any points.....<br>
if we have any raids before that, or in any situation where there arent any plausible looters at the raid with positive points, this is how it will work......<br>
<br>
also, i will probably go ahead and add points to the 2 or 3 unapplied raids/events that we have done (unapplied meaning that points were not applied to members list yet, since im lazy, so after changing to this system now, might be good idea to just have those most recent events count towards ppls points)<br>
<br>
and rulark, yes, you are basically a member now.....youve been on 2 events/raids already and also showed up for PoH.....thats what we want in our members, so, uh, welcome, or something ;)<br>
<br>
one thing your questions have just brought up a question from me is, what does the new point system do when there, as i said above, ARE no ppl present at a raid with positive points? hmmmmmm.......would it be fair for them to just take 0 points for the raid and loot? we had a discussion earlier about them having to take 0 points for the next TWO raids in order to loot (so they cant continue to just 'take 0 points for this raid and get loot on every raid')........i forgot about this when writing up the formal post here.......<br>
<br>
which one sounds best to all of you? im all for making the system more solid and taking less rewards myself ;) thus, taking 0 points for the next two raids, if you want to loot an item, and have 0 points, is imo the best way to do it.......<br>
<br>
alot of you dont seem to understand that on almost all raids, less then half of the ppl raiding actually get loot to take away with them......thats just the way EQ works.....so if, for example, on our avg raid, 1/3 of the ppl actually get loot, then the ideal point system would be one where points are awarded so that on every third raid, any given person will have gotten an item (and be reset to 0)...this means the avg item is going to cost around 5 to 6 points......<br>
if that sounds like alot of work for 1 item, too bad, thats the way EQ works, that has nothing to do with our point system ;)<br>
how many open raids have you been on where more then 1/4th of the ppl actually got an item?<br>
ive been on none..... <p><HR>

Not sure this is a good idea, because then you have to care for 2 lists: one list with the points and the other list with the raids attended. Imho it would be better to convert looting and attending raids to one point system. Practically this would mean that a player who has 0 points and loots an item is set to -4. All players with negative points cannot loot at all. <br>
But maybe I have overlooked a sideeffect of allowing negative numbers. <br>

Recruiting: SCARAB Mercenary Aid&quot;<br>
<br>
What exactly constitutes &quot;recruiting mercenary aid&quot;? If person A goes in the channel and says &quot;I need to take down mob B, anyone feel like helping me?&quot; and persons B and C respond in the line of &quot;sure, what the hell, I'm bored here anyway&quot;, is that &quot;recruiting mercenary aid&quot; and thus requiring to pay the points? (Heh, myself most of the time I would welcome the chance to get some purpose in life for a while, and far from feeling the help-needee shoudl have to pay or make up for it - obviously this might vary from person and person and time to time)<br>
<br>
(Actually, as far as I can read the rules (though I am a bit tired ATM) I only see it stated as you have to HAVE the points; it never says they are lost or deducted - is this itentional or an oversight (I can see arguments for both so))<br>
<br>
On the OTHER hand, in a strictly mercenary sense, if you see it as by paying (?) the points you're guaranteed the help, well, you can't expect anyone to help out just because if they don't have or inclination (though perhaps I'm just being obstinate here, given that being awarded raid points for it would be an incentive)<br>
<br>
So what cases exactly falls under these rules?<br>
<br>
(Sorry for blathering on for too long and using probably thrice as many words as necessary to convey my point and probably failing anyway :-)) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bscarab5467.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sildmuffinhands>Sild Muffinhands</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(10/29/02 2:57:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fscarab5467frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: POINTS SYSTEM: POINT WIPE</span><hr size=1> My opinion of recruition mercenary aid is to post a planned fight on this voard and do a signup and then taking the mob down<br>
Example: I want to do my final epic fight, i post on board time and place and all info how many i need and what classes, you sign up i reserve epic item and i pay points. Some mobs have to be taken spontaniously tho so i guess a large scale raid that is taken out of scarab channel also will be recruting mercenary aid.

youre just wiping your points for loot, same as if you looted an item on a raid......<br>

Things are a bit different with Kael drops, however (in my opinion). <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The idea behind the point system is that every member knows its current point balance. If an item drops on a raid, people should tell the RL/ML their points and that they are willing to spend them on the item under discussion (as written down in the rules section by Mori). The person with the most points then wins the item and has his/her points reset (according to the current rules). Ideally, everybody knows his current point balance as it is hard to keep the list up to date all the time. For one reason, I am not around every day to work out a new list after each raid (imagine two raids happening on subsequent days) and I would like to leave the threads around for some time to give people a chance to make corrections.<br>
<br>
There are good and bad sides of this system. The bad side is that there is an additional organisational overhead to keep track of points during raids. On the other hand, it makes sure that a certain fairness is applied (people who help more/attend more raids have a better chance to get drops, drops on which there is competition will not go to the same person etc.).<br>
<br>
SCARAB is still young and I think that these things have simply not settled in yet. But if we came up with a point system, we should try to use it, or forego it completely. But I agree with Antaios - we have to be clear about what we want. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
We do need some basic rules though. For example: It should not happen that the same person wins two superior items from pure luck on rolls if there is competition on both. In a perfect world, this person would pass on following rolls to give others a chance but this rarely happens. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  An easy-to-use system I have seen applied is: everybody on a raid has the same chance to roll on a drop that he can use (i.e. NBG) but he is then excluded from further roles. This is handy for class-specific drops. Once everyone has got a drop, the rolls are reset and everyone can have another go.<br>
<br>
There was not much feedback on Mori's original suggestions but maybe there is some feedback now that we got the first few raids on our backs. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bscarab5467.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sazzily>Sazzily</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(11/19/02 8:41:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fscarab5467frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: POINTS SYSTEM: POINT WIPE</span><hr size=1> Hi all,<br>
<br>
My first post on these boards, and I have yet to attend a raid in the name of SCARAB. Anyway I am quite experienced in raiding and i have led numerous guildraids and therefore I post my feelings.. <br>
<br>
I think the Point system written by Mori is very very good and I would really like to be raiding with that kind of system for loot division. Why? All systems have their good and bad sides. NBG is bad in a way, because it is hard to define NBG in a fair way. To /ran on all items are bad in a way, because some people walk away with nothing. Auctioning is bad in a way, because it takes time and if it is auctioning with raid-points the administration is worse, if it is with pp the rich characters get the loot. Mori's system above is for me one of the best systems around and as I said I only hope it is put into use because of its fairness.<br>
<br>
Hate-armour... I think the system would be fair about the hate-armour also.. in the long run.. at least it is not any more unfair than open rolls.. If we add a rule that one person cannot have two loots before anyone else has gotten one then we have a problem with one person winning boots and then arms drop. I bet there are different persons interested in boots than in arms, so the rule I mentioned would be meaning less. Further on the part are NO DROP and LORE, right? That means that anyway no person can loot two similar parts.. <br>
<br>
Let's use Mori's system as it is written and of course it can be changed, but until someone changes what is written then lets use it.<br>

I'm entirely happy with the system of point wipe/-10 points for a good drop and no raid points for that raid for getting a not so good drop (as a wizzie, carmine in Fear would count as a &quot;not so good drop&quot; as almost every 50+ wiz will have better in every slot).  The &quot;only one drop until everyone else of your class who wants it has got a drop&quot; rule I also agree with, but the point wipe should ensure this anyway unless someone has a very large number of points and losing 10 means they still have more than anyone else, so the extra one drop only rule is worth having.<br>

<br>
I am still an advocate of the principle of 'purchasing' the items with points (you can bid 0 points too!).  This is a very simple system and I can give you an example.  It means a slight bit of extra work for the ML (to keep a note of points spent) but it provides a fair and necessary system.  BTW in no circustances can people bid on an item when it will take them into negative points at the end of the raid.<br>
<br>
Example 1 of Hate Raid<br>
<br>
1. Cleric BP drops<br>
2. ML announces in raid channel<br>
3. Three clerics are interested Karlousx, Curium and Runemoon<br>
4. Each send tell to ML with their bids<br>
5. Karlousx bids 2 points, Curium bids 1 point, Runemoon bids 1 points<br>
6. ML announces that Karlousx wins the breast plate.<br>
7. ML notes that Karlousx has spent 2 points thus far.<br>
<br>
Example 2 of Hate Raid<br>
<br>
1. Cleric Legs drops<br>
2. ML announces in raid channel<br>
3. Two clerics are interested Karlousx and Runemoon<br>
4. Karlousx bids 1 point, Runemoon bids 1 point<br>
5. ML randoms 1-2, Runemoon wins<br>
6. ML announces that Runemoon wins the legs<br>
7. ML notes points spent so far etc.<br>
<br>
Example 3 of Hate Raid<br>
<br>
1. Cleric bracer drops<br>
2. ML accounces in raid channel<br>
3. Three clerics are interested Karlousx, Curium and Runemoon<br>
4. Karlousx bids 0, Curium bids 0 and Runemoon bids 0.<br>
5. ML randoms 1-3, Karlousx wins<br>
6. ML announces that Karlousx wins the bracer<br>
7. ML doesn't note anything because no points were spent<br>
<br>
What this does is sort out what people consider to be the current 'market value' in terms of time resource and their own personal needs.  It also means that most items will cost something (unless people consider the item to be of little value).  <br>
<br>
Obviously it should be NBG in terms of say a Sky Shrine Plate BP dropped, then I as Deslok couldn't bid on the item unless there were no class available who wanted the item (highly unlikely).<br>
<br>
It also means that people are more willing to spend points.  To be honest at the moment I'm on around 6 points after the Hate raid is added.  I won't be spending those points on something unless it provides a significant upgrade in all honesty.  So I'll probably end up accumulating many points before I feel inclined to lost 10 points on something that will make a difference to my game play.  I realise that's quite a negative attitude but it's something that we're going to face with the current system.<br>
<br>
Maybe we could try the 'buying' method with points on a raid to get a feel for it?  After all, we've already had a points wipe so trying a slightly different method isn't that drastic in relative terms.<br>
<br>
Just to clarify the process I am suggesting.<br>
<br>
1. Item drops<br>
2. ML announces in raid channel<br>
3. Interested classes that can use the item send tells to the ML with the amount of points they're willing to bid for the item.<br>
4. ML gives the item to the person who bid the most points or randoms for those on the highest equal bids.<br>
5. ML notes the number of points spent by that person.<br>
<br>
I don't think it can get fairer than this, the only case is where an item drops that is class specific and there is only one member of that class on the raid.  They could feasibly bid 0 and know they will win, so maybe this is something that could be looked into.<br>
