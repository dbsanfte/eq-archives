Who: Historian Sharar <br>
Estimated Time: weeks <br>
Minimum Level: 50 <br>
Best Class: Beas <br>
<br>
1. Hail Historian Sharar <br>
<br>
Hail historian Sharar and she gives you some long text about taking a book to Elder Animist Dumul. Just answer [yes] to this and she hands you the book. Now the key here is to notice the last line of text. She states that the Khati Sha are disturbed as of late. If you ask what they are disturbed about she doesn't have a complete answer but knows it has to do with the spiritual realm. This is VERY important. Head to the Beastlord guild and Elder Animist Dumul is standing behind a counter next to the guildmaster. <br>
<br>
2. Take book to Elder Animist Dumul <br>
<br>
Hand him the book and he says something to the effect of not trusting you or something. He asks how much you know. This is where you use the text from Sharar. You state you know the Khati Sha are disturbed about the spiritual realm. I believe the trigger here is the word spirit/spiritual. He then states basically you are a nosy little punk but he likes that and you might be the person they are looking for. He asks you to bring him back the Copper Medal of War. He says it can be retrieved by helping the scouts in the Grimling Forest. <br>
<br>
3. Complete &quot;Copper Medal of War&quot; Quest <br>
<br>
Scout Husman asks you for 6 people of about his level. To wipe out a grimling camp nearby. <br>
<br>
Purchase a polished Acrylia Sphere from the nearby shopkeeper to start the quest. <br>
<br>
The scout will march straight out and assault a camp of grimlings. It's your job to keep him alive during the initial camp take and the follow up waves of grimlings. There are about 5 Grimlings in the camp, and the waves consist of 4 or 5 grimlings a piece. <br>
<br>
Eventually a Grimling officer will appear (who is much stronger than the Grimlings). Kill him to recieve a medallion from Scout Husman. <br>
<br>
You Must keep Scout Husman alive in order to finish the quest. <br>
<br>
Suggested force is about 6 level 40s or 2 or 3 high level 50s. As a 57 enchanter, the officer proved annoying since he could not be mermerized. <br>
<br>
Once you have the Copper Medal of War in hand, run back to Elder Animist Dumul. When you hand it in, he hands you an Official Seal of the Khati Sha and a Carved Wooden Crate. The crate is a 6 slot container that has a combine button and the Seal (haven't id'ed it yet) seems to look like those ancient coins you get. He states that if you lose the seal at any point to return to him and state that you have lost the seal and would please like another and he gives you another. He also says to stash those two items and return to him in a bit when you are ready to be briefed. I stashed the two items in my bank, ran back over there and stated [I was ready to be briefed]. He speaks of a magic-user that is using wooden totems to siphon the power of elder spirits using [new magic]. He is using this power to summon entities of malign intent. He then states that through further research, they (the Khati Sha) have discovered the name of the magic-user <br>
<br>
4. Give Seal to a Scout <br>

a) Perma (by Entrence/ladder, behind some rocks) <br>
<br>
[Wed Jan 30 11:20:32 2002] Scout Janomin says 'It is a comfort to meet you, Kaedhar. I was afraid that you might not be able to track me with weather out there being what it is. I must admit that my fondness of the snow is at an all time low right now. The sooner you release the spirit that resides in here, the sooner we can make a way back to a warmer climate. ' <br>
<br>
[Wed Jan 30 11:20:32 2002] Scout Janomin says 'The spirit that you seek is deep within these halls. I tracked it into this lair more than a week ago. The spirit has taken up residence with the other bears in the lower chambers during that time. It should be relatively easy for your and your people to reach. Once you release the spirit, please return the totem to me. I will prepare it for the journey to Shar Vahl. May stealth and good fortune move with you. ' <br>
<br>
[Wed Jan 30 11:20:32 2002] A large creature growls from deep within its icy lair. ' <br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
5. Bring box back to Dumul <br>
<br>
Putthe 6 totems in the box and hit combine. <br>
<br>
Give the Box back to Elder Animist Dumul: <br>
<br>
Reulting Text: <br>
<br>
Elder Animist Dumul says 'I have received word from several of our scouts indicating your impending arrival. We are all very pleased that you were able to release all of the spirits before any true harm could manifest itself. Your efforts have not only restored balance to the spirit realm, they seem to have also acted to hinder any other plans our antagonist may have had... for the time being. ' <br>
<br>
<br>
Elder Animist Dumul says 'Our Taruun scouts have discovered Draz Nurakk's location. A scout has returned from a set of islands on the Old World. The islands are in a place called Timorous. The Taruun returned while leaving a scout behind to insure that the foul Animist does not evade us any further. You will need to find the island on which our scout has set up camp. The island has a great statue on it. Hopefully, he will still be in that location. Show him this seal and he will know that I sent you to assist. ' <br>
<br>
6. Talk with Scout in Timerous <br>
<br>
Scout Sihmoj says 'Good to see you, now keep your head down friend. He may look out here at any moment, though he's been asleep most of the day. He's been staying in a ruined building on that island over there. I'm sure you can see it from here. You should be able to surprise him with little trouble. Just take care to avoid any traps he may have set. He's proven to be a very capable magic-user. ' <br>
<br>
Scout Sihmoj says 'When you finish with him, please bring any evidence of his being dispatched back to me in this bag. I'll direct you from there. Good luck... I'll watch from here. ' <br>
<br>
Green-con Draz Nurakk spawned in the small ruin on the opposite isle. Killed him, dropped nothing. <br>
Draz Nurakk's corpse explodes into thousands of brilliant glass fragments! ' <br>
<br>
On his death 6 blue con iksars named &quot;Draz Nurakk's Image&quot; spawned. All but 1 was slowable. I had 24 people there, was handled very easily. Not sure as to what they hit for. <br>
<br>
each of these images dropped &quot;Shards of Broken Glass&quot; in which you combine in the pouch given by the scout. <br>
<br>
Scout Sihmoj says 'I knew that this creature had power, but how do you explain this? That fight was well beyond my comprehension. I'm not sure what to do other than have you return the bag to Elder Dumul. I'm sure that he will know what to do next. Take care and be swift. ' <br>
<br>
7. Return to Dumul <br>
<br>
Elder Animist Dumul says 'My fears were well founded, and I am glad that I have had people that are able to understand those fears. Please do not think that I have intentionally placed you in the path of harm, but I did have my suspicions about our adversary's strength. I am not surprised that he was able to deceive us in this manner. I thank the spirits that you were able to evade harm in your completion of this task. ' <br>
<br>
Elder Animist Dumul says 'Take this note to Arms Historian Qua. He has been researching a means of circumventing any protective magic that Draz Nurakk may have in place. When you meet him next, you will be well equipped to complete the restoration of balance to the spirit realm. Make your way to Qua and do as he says. ' <br>
<br>
8. Talk to Arms Historian Qua <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Arms Historian Qua' <br>
<br>
Arms Historian Qua says 'Hail citizen, may I help you find a book or are you looking for assistance with something else? ' <br>
Your Location is -176.79, 52.26, -188.25 <br>
Arms Historian Qua says 'It is a pleasure to meet you, Rugom. The Animists mentioned that someone would be by, but for me not to wait, so I sent the information that they requested to Weapons Master Rahoul. He is having a master smith finish the blades. ' <br>
Arms Historian Qua says 'Take him this receipt and I'm sure that he'll get you the weapons as soon as possible. Take care, Rugom. It appears that a lot of people are relying on you in this matter. You may be the only person that can do this. ' <br>
<br>
9. Talk to Weapons Master Rahoul / Collect Items <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Weapons Master Rahoul' <br>
Weapons Master Rahoul says 'Hail friend, are you a new recruit or have you been at it for a bit? ' <br>
<br>
Your Location is -105.99, -540.14, -258.75 <br>
Weapons Master Rahoul says 'You are just the time. The weapon that Elder Dumul requested has almost been completed. We need you to gather a few items in order to complete the weapon. These items will not require much effort to acquire, but I will need to tell you where to look. Place all of the items that I request in this box and return it to me as quickly as possible. ' <br>
<br>
Weapons Master Rahoul says 'Now, seek out a large chunk of perfect acrylia ore, two Gems of the Void, and chunk of dense fungal padding. Once I have those items, I can finish the weapon that you will need to use to kill the dark animist. ' <br>
<br>
Weapons Master Rahoul says 'The ore that I require is often used to create living rock formations. These collections of rocks and boulders will often leave a trail of energy that causes other rocks to collect and come to life. Our scouts have seen these formations in a variety of areas. Take care when you attempt to gather this ore. ' <br>
<br>
Weapons Master Rahoul says 'If you look in the Maiden's Eye, you will find entities that are the embodiment of darkness. Their twisted spirits are not allowed to escape the form that they inhabit. They have no hope of escape, unless they are released during the destruction of their material form. There are some occasions when the power that is used to keep them in this realm will turn upon itself during this period of destruction. This process is what produces the Gems of the Void. ' <br>
<br>
Weapons Master Rahoul says 'When traversing the Deep, you will run across a shrieking fungus. Those creatures are much more durable and dangerous than the other fungi that you may encounter in the caverns of Luclin. It is for this reason that we use their flesh as padding. Take care when hunting them, for they will provide a good challenge. ' <br>
<br>
10. Return to Weapons Master Rahoul <br>
<br>
Combine items and hand box back to Weapons Master Rahoul: <br>
<br>
Weapons Master Rahoul says 'These claws should work well for you. The design was research by Historian Qua. They should work to neutralize the magical field that protects the dark animist and allow you to tear his scaly flesh from his frame. Remember that all of this is theoretical. Those claws are an original creation. You will be the first to prove their effectiveness in combat. ' <br>
<br>
Weapons Master Rahoul says 'Take the claws back to Animist Dumul and show him their design. Use them well, Despim. May the spirits guide you in your attack. ' <br>
<br>
11. Give claws to Dumul <br>
<br>
Give the 2 claws to Animist Dumul: <br>
<br>
Elder Animist Dumul says 'These claws are exquisite. I can see that a great deal of thought went into their design. Now it is your turn to demonstrate your proficiency in your chosen role. You have a great challenge ahead of you, for we have determined that only these claws will work to harm this dark animist, this corrupter of spirits. You will need the support of your people; but in the end, only the strength of your will can save us. ' <br>
<br>
Elder Animist Dumul says 'Our scouts have tracked Draz Nurakk to an abandoned village in the Fungus Grove. We learned of his intent to track you down. I take it that he did not appreciate your willingness to assist us. He knows who you are, so it will be best for us to get him before he can conjure up any more surprises. Find Scout Halmia in the Grove and give her this seal. Then bring the evidence of his destruction to me when you are done. Place his head, the seal, and those claws in this box and return it to me. ' <br>
<br>
12. Final Battle in FG <br>
<br>
Turn in seal to Scout Halimia in Fungus Grove. <br>
<br>
Kill Draz Nurakk - Loot head <br>
<br>
Put head, your claws, and the seal into the box and hit combine. <br>
<br>
Give box to Elder Animist Dumul <br>
<br>
You get your reward <br>
Reward(s): <br>
Claw of the Savage Spirit (Primary)<br>
Claw of the Savage Spirit (Secondary)<br>
Dark Animist's Greaves<br>
Dark Animist's Tunic<br>
