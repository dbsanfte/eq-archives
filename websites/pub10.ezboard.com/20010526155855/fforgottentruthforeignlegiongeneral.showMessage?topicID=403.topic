Do I go North, South, East or West? Do I take ol' Scratch's advice and head down the path that looks oh so smooth and full of rewards but just out of site is full of pitfalls and rough terrain that will damn my very existence for all eternity once the glamour and glitz has worn thin? <br>
<br>
Or, do I accept the challenge and walk down that dirt road ... full of angry billows of wind that whip up swirls of dust to choke and blind those faithful passers-by? A path so full of sharp stones that they punch up through the soles of shoes worn thin by the endless heat of the road and the never ending trug towards a mystical goal that my or may not even exist. Is this what it means to be have faith? Faithful? To blindly accept without a shred of proof? <br>
<br>
Do I take the easy path with the road-side stands full of beautiful women standing half-dressed around tubs brimming with ice and oh-so-cold Corona's and lime wedges? Do I walk the other path down that dusty, thankless trail of sun-baked clay full of cracks that wick away each drop of sweat and blood to leave no evidence of it's having been there? A path where I'll curse each step and raise my fist to the sky and scream with all my might and rage, &quot;Damn you!&quot; &quot;When will it rain!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ah yes, to be at the crossroads where every man and woman has the opportunity to shape the rest of their lives in one way or another. The crossroads, where once you make a choice and take that first step you know you can never turn around and go back. Sure, there will be other crossroads in life ... but never this same one. Do I go left, do I go right, do I go North, do I go South ...<br>
<br>
And so, here I stand at the crossroads. The sun is slowly setting, the crickets begin to chirp with the onset of nightfall and a brief swirl of a breeze stirs the dust at my feet bring just a hint of the smell of fresh mowen grass and new rainfall from off in the distance ... but from which direction I can not tell. Do I go left, do I go right, do I go North, do I go South ...<br>
<br>
I've taken a brief leave of absence from Asheron's Call due to a bit of burn-out and requirements of work. During that time I've dabbled in our old game of Everquest. I've always missed the graphics but with an equal passion always hated the fact that in EQ I HAD to group. Just to test a theory I've been playing a Druid solo. I've run into a few frustrations but for the most part I'm having a lot of fun. Sure, I miss all of you ... my friends ... but I needed to see something for myself. This is what I found:<br>
<br>
In EQ I will, as a Druid, be a viable character that can actually make it to level 50 and beyond by my own skills or in a group. In AC, with Crow, I can make it to level 50 in a group or solo but this is not the same as level 50 in EQ ... level 100 in AC is more like level 50 in EQ. So, the question now becomes can crow make it to level 100 in AC? Probably not ..., at least not with any amount of fun. I can see any character that has not submitted to the AC 3 magic school template being seriously hampered in AC, being unable to level quickly, being unable to join in the epic quests that makes AC oh so differant. But what does it matter if AC does have this ongoing story arc if I can't ever be able to participate? For characters like myself I see them being doomed to an existence of being driven underground. Archer's to Olthoi nests and Melee/Wall draining Mages to Tusker dens. Running after the goal of the monthly quest/update is just not an option.<br>
<br>
So, the question is do I stay in AC and be happy being forced to a life of bug killing but knowing I have friends there with me ... or do I run off into EQ where for the moment, before any future nerfs, I can survive and hunt where and how I please?<br>
<br>
Standing at the crossroads I know where the path marked AC will lead me. Looking at the glitzy road of EQ I can see all these promises but the road winds so much there is no telling what is around the next bend.<br>
So ... here I stand at the crossroads knowing that I can't travel both paths and that I have to make a decision sometime because the surest way to die is to stand in the crossroads too long and risk being rundown by the fate you can not seem to decide upon.<br>
<br>
Decisions, decisions ...<br>

<br>
That is a tough decision. Selfishly, I'd love to see you stay in Dereth, but if you're not having fun, or if you're not getting that feeling of accomplishment, then I'd understand if you want to move on.<br>
<br>
But here's a couple of alternatives. First, if you want to re-roll, Ghar would be willing to provide buffs whenever we're both on. I can only cast IV's reliably, but with Creature &amp; Item buffs, I bet we could get a new character to a reasonable level pretty quickly. Starting Friday I'm off from work until after New Years, so I'll have plenty of time to play.<br>
<br>
The other possibility is that I've been fooling around with a new character myself. Ghar started with 10/10 focus/self, and with arcane only trained, I'm starting to get a little frustrated myself. I'm thinking of joining the crowd and starting a spec-life axe guy. This guy will be a total wimp to start (no melee defense until 12, no Item until 32). But his upside should be much higher than Ghar. Anyway, maybe we could re-roll together, and anyone else whose thinking of starting a new character could join in. Hopefully Deirdra could join us! Be newbies again, see some of the new low-level dungeons like Murk Warrens and the new city. I bet in a couple of months we could be close to our old levels, and have a lot of fun on the way.<br>
<br>
Well, whatever you decide, I definitely understand what you're going through. And if you do decide to leave AC, well, we'll just meet up again in the next world!</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#2f2f4f><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/ulusarl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lusarl</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>12/19/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#5F9EA0>8:33:50 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fforgottentruthforeignlegiongeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=403.topic&index=2><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Reply</FONT></A></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Decisions, decisions ...</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Tis a tough descision you have before you and I envy you not for it. You were one of the main reasons I joined AC, your writing and ability to roleplay, you watchful eye after I had grown to know you. I appologize now for not being able to pull myself from the reagular happenings to RP out the ideas we had planned. Truly Ghar has stated it best. I would hate to see you go from our world, I will not even try to imagine the diffrence it would make for it would hurt to much. But...twould truly be selfish for me to try and disuade you. Tis a decision each must face for themselves, as you now do. I know not where your road will take you Crow, or what fate has in mind, but i hope that no matter what the decision she smiles upon you and watches over you in time of need. Know that we will be here if you decide to make that journey and ever return. I wish you well in whatever decision you make for whatever it is it will be the right one.     Your Friend;<br>

Just thought that I would remind you.  In EQ, I was a druid!  None other than Wamba, &quot;The Mighty Druid of Doom&quot;.  (heh heh. I still love saying that)<br>
Druids in EQ have a lot of fun spells and abilities, no doubt about it.  But I do not want you to make this decision without knowing the flip side of being a druid.<br>
Many of the best spells do not work &quot;indoors&quot;, until you reach the upper levels.  <br>
Many of the best spells are prep spells, and &quot;1st strike&quot; type spells.  If you can't cast them before melee begins, forget it.  In EQ, everytime you get hit, you lose the spell you are casting, so spells that have a long casting time are not viable if you are in a melee solo.<br>
The long and short of it is, when you level into the 20's, the only way you can solo is to stay outdoors, and be the 1st strike attacker.  There were many monsters in EQ that I could kill solo, BUT ONLY if I got the jump on them.  If they saw me first, I was in trouble.  And in EQ you can win 20 fights, then lose all your gains with ONE loss.  This got EXTREMELY frustrating to me.  So even Druids in EQ need to fight within groups.  <br>
-And if you decide to spend more time in EQ for a while, that's okay too.  It's not like we are going to evict you from our guild or anything!  You are our friend.<br>
And that's all I care to say about that.
