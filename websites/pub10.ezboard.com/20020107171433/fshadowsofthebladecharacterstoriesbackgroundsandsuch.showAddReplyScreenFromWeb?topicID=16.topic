young Tier’Dal spoke in excited anticipation.<br>
<br>
The young Priestess nodded, “Fetch Lady Yathrin. Surely she will wish to know of this.”<br>
<br>
The young acolyte bowed crisply and turned on his heels, making haste for the exit of the small inn.<br>
<br>
The priestess turned to the small oaken table that sat in the corner of the room, taking in her hand a bottle of brandy. She smiled softly as she took the bottle, staring for a moment at the contents. Swirling the bottle lightly she poured a small amount of the amber liquid into a crystal glass and raised the glass to her lips, her eyes peering at the worn figure laying in the bed as her mind wandered to recall the events of the past days…<br>
<br>
-----------------<br>
<br>
The forest was filled as normal with young Tier’Dal scurrying about, slaughtering anything..and everything that moved. The bulk of the young priestess’ day had been spent seeing to the needs of Innoruuks children healing them and casting protective magicks upon them. After saving several young (and foolish) necromancers the young priestess gathered up her packs and headed south along the path, crossing the stone bridge that linked the two shores of the river Nerius.<br>
<br>
She stepped lively in her travels as she headed southerly. The gloom of the forest had an almost refreshing quality to it, bringing a small smile to her full lips. Tier’Dal ran to and from as they made way to Neriak where they would sell captured goods to the merchants. She stopped clear in her tracks. Something was amiss. She could not place her finger upon it but the tingly sensation made her feel at unease as she dropped her bags. Her soft mailed hands reached to her side as she hefted the steel mace to a ready position, her eyes narrowed to slits as she surveyed the surrounding forest.<br>
<br>
A soft breeze brushed at the nape of her neck causing a chill to run up and down her spine. The forest was suddenly silent aside from the rustling of leaves in the soft wind.<br>
<br>
-----------------<br>
<br>
Her mind quickly flooded with images of a ruined landscape. Lava flowing from the cracks of the rocky terrain as sulfurous billows of smoke were parted by the legions of undead. Skeletal steeds carried ghoulish warriors into battle as undead footmen raised weapons to the outnumbering ranks of Feir’Dal. Astride a steed of the purest night and clad in armor woven from Hatred itself stood a night surveying the battle. He was without feature and a tattered cloak of shadows hung from his back with black tendrils of sentience whipping about him, a barbed obsidian blade was gripped firmly in his hand as he shook the reigns of his steed galloping into the fray. The image slowly faded as quickly as it had come, leaving with her only the sounds of clashing steel and screams of terror.<br>
<br>
-------------------<br>
<br>
Her mace fell to the ground in a “thud” as she dropped to her hands and knees. Her head ached as if a thousand dwarven smiths found out that the dwellings of her mind was best for crafting their metals. She sat back on her knees, slipping her gloves off as she massaged her temples.<br>
<br>
“In the name of the Father…”, she whispered in disbelief at the perhaps “divine revelation” she had been granted.<br>
<br>
The young priestess slowly gathered her possessions and hefted herself to her feet. A slight panic overwhelmed her as she had fallen from the path as well as being turned around in her “daze”. She looked frantically for a recognizable landmark but could see little past the thick morning fog of the forest.<br>
<br>
“Well then..,” she muttered, her eyes darting about herself as she scanned her surroundings.<br>
<br>
“I guess any way is better then no way.” she whispered to herself.<br>
<br>
After walking not more then a dozen yards the young priestess saw the silhouette in the distance. Upon closer...and cautious inspection it appeared to be a fallen body. Perhaps claimed by that intolerable bard who roamed the forest or the vicious wildlife that appeared at every inconvenient moment. It was a Tier’Dal. From the signs of it he was alive…barely, and looked as if he had been travelling for weeks from the telltale signs of caked on mud and dirt. The young priestess rolled the Tier’Dal to his back and examined him.<br>
<br>
“Hmmm. I’m going to need some assistance for this.” she muttered under her breath, aware that she alone could not carry the fallen warrior back to Neriak…<br>
<br>
To be continued….<br>
