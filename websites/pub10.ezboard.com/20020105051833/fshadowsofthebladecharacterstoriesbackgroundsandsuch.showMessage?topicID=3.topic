<br>
There are roughly three neighborhoods in Neriak. The first is called the Foreign quarter. It's the area where the Teir'Dal allow other races to live in their cavernous home as long as they bring something to the far removed communtiy that it can't produce itself. Like the strong Ogre smiths that make bladed weapons of unparalleled size and balance, or the Trolls, who are knowledgalbe in the ways of the earth and of swamps and all the prodigous goods harvested from them, or the humans, who more often that not bring only human whores for the Teir'Dal who have an interest in such women.<br>
<br>
The second neighborhood, known as the commons, is where most of the Teir'Dal of Neriak make there homes. Those dark elves who have found themselves not belonging to any particular house for some reason can find room and board here for moderate prices. This is also where one would do there shopping or banking, and the home of Neriak's famous 'Drowned Fish' rumored to be the most beautiful bar in all Norrath, at least by the Teir'Dal anyway.<br>
<br>
The last neighborhood, the one furthest from the entrance into the subterranean town, and thus the most protected is known as the 3rd gate. The most powerful of the Teir'Dal houses make thier strongholds here. In a complex interweaving of stalagtites, stalagmites and and other natural rock formations, the 3rd gate forms a maze of interconnecting and intersecting alleyways and corridors between houses and rocky cliffs. Often times, taking what seems to be a natural path in the 3rd gate can lead to a sheer black wall, or and endlessly deep chasm running in both directions. Some of the pathways lead to the doors of powerful Teir'Dal houses like N'Farre, known for it's poerful foot soldiers, or house Q'Tazsh, known for it's enormous wealth in art and sculpture. These direct paths are hard to find and well hidden, but certainly attainable to those who know where to look, or those who stumble blindy through the 3rd gate for some reason. Because of this latter reason and still another reason, that of potential thieves and asassins, these pathways are invariable trapped with complex wiring and spells that, if triggered, mean certain death to the trespasser, meanwhiule alerting the house that someone appraoches, or did anyway.<br>
<br>
The thieves of Ebon Mask call them &quot;Lix'mey'frash&quot; or promotion's punishment, because upon being promoted from novitate to member of the Ebon Mask one is required travel these hallways and pilfer and item from a house in the 3rd gate. The item is always something meaningless, a few hairs from the pillow of the Patron's pillow, or a square cut from a rug in the main hallway, for to steal something of value would mean bringing down the wrath of that house upon all of the Ebon Mask. The very existence of the guild of thieves is frowned upon by many noble houses. The item, if captured, and if the member to be survived, often became a luck token and the thief would never take it off his or her person.<br>
<br>
It was known by the students of Ebon Hand that this test had another, less wholesome purpose. To dispose of students that were no longer wanted in the school. A thief knew if he fell in this second group if he or she was called upon to take the Lix'mey'frash when he or she wasn't yet elligible ot be a member of the Ebon Hand yet. Only those who were Novitate could graduate to member, Initiates were the lowest rank, then &quot;Dro'hie&quot; or simply half novitate came before the Novitate rank, and had thier own tests that must be passed first.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Initiate Xosha was awakened with a shove on her bottom bunkbed. She always slept on the bottom bunk since sleeping on the top made her back feel exposed to an attack from beneath through the mattress. Infact in the bunk above her had five such marks of asassination, five thin slits dyed dirty brown with old blood.<br>
<br>
&quot;Awaken Initiate,&quot; it was Dro'hie Y'Bretix, the personal valet to Master F'Staei, head of  Initiate training. &quot;Master F'Staei will have you before him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I see.&quot; Xosha was curious. It was far too early in the morning for regular meetings with F'Staei, who made periodic calls on his students to check on thier progress. It was also too early for a reprimand from the council on the murder of Quickiron. Such a reprimand would be given infront of the full counil of Ebon Mask, since sentencing was made by a vote of all council members and some were away on amabassadorial trips to Oggok and the like.<br>
<br>
Xosha threw on her cloak, she was all ready dressed in her full leather, as she often slept in an attempt to be better prepared should she need to be off quickly in the night. She followed Dro'hie Y'Bretix to the long hallway where the personal offices of each Master were housed. Knocking on the door, the Dro'hie was rewarded with a &quot;Come.&quot; Y'Bretix opened the door, revieling master F'Staei seated behind a desk facing them both. There were no papers nor boxes on the desk, no parchment or quill. F'Staei sat leaning back in his chair, his hands behind his head and his feat resting on the desk. He stared up at the ceiling in quiet contiplation.<br>
<br>
&quot;Will there be anything further Master?&quot; Y'Bretix asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm? Oh, no thank you. Go to sleep now.&quot; he replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;As you wish,&quot; the Dro'hie bowed and closed the door behind himself, his shuffling feet echoing in the empty hall for a moment.<br>
<br>
&quot;Xosha, hmm, yes. I wanted to see you,&quot; F'Staei said. He was middle aged and very handsome. His white hair he kept long and straight. He chose to wear it down around his shoulders without the customary leather strap to tie it into a tail. Many had formed opinions on why he had chosen to wear his hair in such a fashion, a fashion that one would be hard pressed to see any other Teir'Dal wear it. One such theory was that he had no fear of it falling into his eyes and thus blinding him, he was simply so quick and so good that he needn't worry about such things. Another was that he did it as a way of rebellion, a way to seperate himself from the rest of the nobility of which he was a member. More than a member, indeed he the Patron of House F'Staei. This last bit lead many to wonder why he chose to lead the life of a thief at all, instead of living with his riches for the rest of his days deep within the 3rd gate.<br>
<br>
Xosha thought he wore his hair down because he knew how good it looked that way.<br>
<br>
And he DOES look good, she thought, like the moonlight over a dark forest clearing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Will you share a drink with me Initiate Xosha?&quot; he went to a Kithicor darkwood boudoir and removed a decanter of brandy and two glasses.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course,&quot; she sat down on the chair opposite him on the other side of the desk and waited for him to get to the point. She took a sip of the brandy, letting the strong alcohol burn over her tongue, then slowly swallowing and exhaling the fumes that lingered on her tongue.<br>
<br>
&quot;Xosha, I have called you here for two reasons, one that is bad, and one I like to think is good.&quot; F'Staei set down his legs and looked her in the face, she returned with a full and demure smile that she knew men loved.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then tell me the bad first, so that we can... enjoy.. the good news together?&quot; she lifted her eyebrow.<br>
<br>
F'Staei, no stranger to women himself, smiled, lifted his brandy in salute and took another sip. &quot;Very well,&quot; he said. He reached under his desk, found a latch. pulled if with a click and opened a drawer. He produced a letter from it and handed it to Xosha. She took it curiously, looking at the red seal of wax. It was the seal of the council of the Ebon Mask. She unsheathed a dagger from her belt and seperated the wax from the parchment, unfolded it and read.<br>
<br>
-Xosha, tomorrow you will take Lix'mey'frash-<br>
-the council-<br>
<br>
Xosha was stunned for a moment. She had heard the stories, once she had even seen the remains of a novitate who hadn't made it through Lix'mey'frash. His body had been destroyed by a collapsing wall he had failed to discover. The necromancers had bought his body from the crematorium and had brought it back to thier workshop hoping to learn of the traps along the path to the house he HAD discovered. They had been at war with the house he was assigned and hoped he could assist them after death. Xosha had been working there at a young age, scrubbing blood off the floor for a few coppers a week. It had taken her three weeks to get all the fluids and brain matter out of the poors in the rock slab where they had layed him.<br>
<br>
&quot;But what does this mean?&quot; she asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is as I feared Xosha, the feel you have overstepped your boundries by killing Quickiron...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;WHAT!? For killing that bitch?? The entire school hated her, including the coucil. She was abusive and has killed more students than she's allowed to graduate!&quot; Xosha furioulsy threw her hands in the air in exasperation.<br>
<br>
&quot;That is true Xosha, but this beahvior is not thier reason for punishment. If they allow you to kill one of them, whats to stop the next student from killing THIER teacher? Without retribution the studenst will rebel. They will realize they don't deserve to die for trying to please thier masters. They'll realize that the REASON they are failing the tests is that they are so scared to fail they don't try thier hardest.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You almost sound like you disagree with the Masters.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;To say such a thing, that would be treason upon the Ebon Mask. I will only say this: Succeed Xosha! Stick it to them! Beat them at thier own game.&quot; <br>
<br>
Xosha pndered this. Could I do it? she thought. She was no child as the other intiates were. She had reached child bearing age over a hundred years ago now. She wasn't as limber or flexible as the others. Infact she had only really joined the Ebon Mask because she needed a home and was sick of being a prostitute. She shook her head, that was another story.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who is my target?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You get to decide that. I don't think they care because they know you can't do it. They THINK you can't do it. To be sure that you don't succeed, they have asked that as evidence they want you to bring the seal of the Patron, the implement used to place thier  insignia on all of thier letters.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But such a seal will be impossibly guarded, most likely every house Patron sleeps with it clasped in thier hand at night!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Xosha, I am sorry...&quot; was all that F'Staei could say<br>
<br>
&quot;Bah!&quot; exclaimed Xosha. An expression she had picked up from the northern humans in a bar at the foreign quarter &quot;anyway, you said there was some good news?&quot;<br>
<br>
F'staei nodded and got up to fill thier brandy glasses<br>
<br>
&quot;Allow me,&quot; said Xosha, and went to the Boudoir behind the Master.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, good news. Xosha, it is hard for a man like me, a killer, to admit but, I think... that is.... you could decline the test and leave Ebon Hand now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But I'd never be allowed to be a thief. The Ebon Mask would kill me because I knew too mcuh of thier ways!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, well that's not what the hard part for me to say is... there is one way... Come with me, stay at my house. The Ebon Mask would never strike the house of thier own members.&quot;<br>
<br>
The two had thier backs to eachother, F'Staei was facing the door, sitting in his chair, unable to turn for fear of Xosha's rejection. Xosha, having poured both drinks stared at the wall a moment. Then she brought F'Staei his glass and swallowed her own quickly. She waited for him to drink his, then leaned forward and gently kissed him.<br>
<br>
****<br>
<br>
<br>
An hout later the two of them were negotiating the confusing twists of the passage to the House F'Staei. He stopped and pointed out every trap for her, how it was circumvented, and what exactly set it off.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here, stay,&quot; he said at one point. &quot;look at those two cobble stones, see the one on the left? The one that I'm pointing to?&quot; Xosha nodded, &quot;now look above yourself.&quot; Xosha did so and saw a series of small holes in the ceiling approximately twenty feet above. &quot;One wrong step and out come a series of long bronze spears, watch your step, were off.&quot;<br>
<br>
****<br>
<br>
<br>
Later, about midday, F'Staei led Xosha to his bedchamber. His room was lavishly decorated with bear skin rugs and rich Rivervale silk tapestries. It was lit by a gold candleabra in the corner, at the moemtn, it was the only source of light.It flickered shadows on the bodies of the two Teir'Dal, clad in nothing and entwined in eachother. The candles would brun through, and they would be in darkness before the two were finished...<br>
<br>
****<br>
<br>
<br>
Xosha finally arched over backwards, shuddered deeply, then collapsed along side F'Staei, who was hardly moving at all, save for alot of deep breathing. She rolled herself out of bed quickly and pulled oh her leathers.<br>
<br>
&quot;Darling, where do you run off to so suddenly? inquired the Master thief. He was barely able to keep his head up, though he felt fully awake after the lovemaking. &quot;Surely you can't return now, now with your failure to start the Lix'mey'frash. Come, return to me for I would love nothing more than to hold you throughout the rest of the day.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't doubt that you would Master...&quot; Xosha started<br>
<br>
&quot;Please, don't call me Master, nor F'Staei. call me Lennix, it's my given name.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As yo wish Lennix,&quot; she nodded to him, now she was fully dressed. She started looking about the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is there something you seek Xosha?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes Lennix,&quot; she replied without emotion.<br>
<br>
A little confused and a little hurt by her tone Lennix F'Staei tried to raise himself onto his elbows, and found he was too tired of body to move his arms at all.<br>
<br>
&quot;But Xosha, what could you be looking for?&quot; Xosha did not reply, but instead scanned the room again, settled her gaze on a desk, then as if something had dawned on her, she went to it at once and produced her lockpicks<br>
<br>
&quot;Now see here! Stop that at once!&quot; Lennix strained to get up, but more than a lift of his head was too great an effort.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's wrong Lennix? Tired? Betcha can't move a muscle. Arms are heavy too huh? Legs even heavier than that. They won't follow your commands at all now...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What have you done to me!?&quot; demanded Lennix on the verge of panic.<br>
<br>
&quot;The druids of Rivervale are really marvelous gardeners, you know?&quot; Xosha asked Lennix. He seemed confused and shook his head no. &quot;Oh well, they are, take my word for it. It's the mist I think. Keeps the plants cool and always moist. They have these plants in Misty Thicket that can only grow there. The alchemists in the commons have tried to match the Thicket using glass boxes and magic spells, but nothing does it quite right. That's why it's so expensive they say...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dear Xosha, what are you talking about? What did yoy do to me?&quot; Lennix tried sound furious, but his words only came out as a scared shriek.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, didn't I say yet? Sorry....&quot; Xosha heard a click as the lock on the desk opened at last. &quot;the halflings call it 'Gugen-Fie', funny name that, halfling language is so bizarre. It roughly translates into 'Energy-Tap'. You see the trick is you have to have the victims heart rate reach a crucial point for the poison to initialize and take effect and get to the right muscles in time before it is absorbed by the blood..... or something like that, I'm new to this thief stuff.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So you've poisened me then? But how!? I was with you the entire time!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But isn't it obvious? I did it when I filled our second cups of brandy. You told me yourself that I had my choice of targets.&quot; She shuffled around in the drawer for a moment and produced something small and golden. &quot;Ahh here it is, see, you practically told me where you keep important items, desk drawer.&quot; Xosha held up the small gold seal with the insignia of House F'staei. Then she walked to the bed, straddled Lennix and withdrew a long thin dagger from her boot.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well, you win. You have the emblem, oh very devious of you! Now let me be and I'll tell all of the council how great a thief you are.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And have you higher an asassin to off me at the next opportunity? No, sorry Lennix.&quot; She placed the tip of the dagger over his heart.<br>
<br>
&quot;But Xosha I love you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Shhhhhhhh,&quot; she said and and pierced him quickly, covered the wound with a balled up pillow case and waited for him to die.<br>
<br>
Later, in the corridors ot 3rd gate. late into the night, Xosha shook his body onto the street carefully. She pulled off the blanket she had wrapped him in and put it into her knapsack for later disposal. She turned her back, tossed the golden insignia into the air and laughed triumphantly. The she turned, picked up a stone on the ground, aimed, and carefullt tossed it at her target. There was a fast clank, then a series of quick wet kerthunks as Lennix's body was impaled by overhead spikes of bronze. Sure it wasn't full proof, there were witnesses, and the poison in his his body still, but there was enough doubt about her identity to keep her safe enough.<br>
<br>
Xosha turned, tossed the seal into the air, caught it and smiled again. Careful not to set off the traps to House F'Staei, she wistled her way back to the Ebon Mask. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/uxosha.showPublicProfile>Xosha</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br>   <font color=#939393>(4/4/00 9:27:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ned's pride and joy</span><hr size=1> Neriak law states that matters of actual inter-house policy making are always decided upon by a council of house representatives. Usually this consists of head members of certain fields of study within the house itself, for example: The House Baker, the Linen Mistress in charge of laundry and bedding, the House Baker, the Administrations Superior, in charge of keeping track of the many dealings and appointments of the house schedule, plus of course the Matron or Patron, and any specific house only duties. The last is well illustrated in house N'Bbaro, which has a member of the council for every disipline of magic alone.<br>
<br>
Tradition states that truly IMPORTANT matters are made in a backroom of The Blind Fish. The room is reached by walking downstairs and paying &quot;.....&quot; a nominal fee, then being led through a secret door (which is a bit of a falsehood since every house had used the spot and thusly it was well known where the door was. All the same the door is magically consealed and therefore is called a &quot;hidden&quot; door all the same) which inturn opened to short hallway. At the end of this hallway stands a nine foot large, red skeleton named simply &quot;Ned&quot;. &quot;.......&quot; then talks to Ned quietly and motions at the assemblage at Ned's door. Ned, who is fully animate and sentient, and being dead, completely unneeding of food or rest is always here (except when inside the room behind the door), and when he is approached by &quot;....&quot; he turns his boney head the the assembled people and makes a great show of looking them up and down, which he does by raising and lowering his skull slowly over incommers' bodies. The purpose of which is to pantomime a bit so that others can understand what he is doing. He is really a very understanding skeleton in this way.<br>
<br>
After it has been made clear that Ned has looked you over and seen fit to allow you to his sanctum he speaks to you, his voice is like Innoruuk himself, powerful and immense, without fear and without care, He speaks the same words everytime someone wishes to enter his lair. Many have speculated over it's meaning, but it is sure only Ned could ever say what it means for sure, and Ned isn't saying.<br>
<br>
&quot;Twix two trees<br>
pace you now,<br>
mouth it feeds<br>
five you now.<br>
When said is done<br>
and exit you,<br>
four more trees<br>
but one makes you.&quot;<br>
<br>
And upon the reverent uttering of his verse, Ned turns jolly at once, attempts to pick up any number of Norrathian accents he has been rehearsing inbetween visitors during his life, and then his unlife, and then opens the door in a skeleton's grin.<br>
<br>
The room itself is no coffin like lair of the dead, rather the opposite. It's a square and evenly shaped room, smoothly polished walls. but not too much as to shine and throw off the lighting of the place. It is carpeted in a burgundy lush rug woven by the skilled hands of the Freeport Loomswomen's Guild. A large table of deep rosewood sits absolute center with cushioned chairs numbering fourteen surrounding it. Bowls with fresh fruit and meats are always abundantly stocked and displayed upon the table, and always delicious. A bronze candlabra stands at the three corners of the room, burning wax candles and never dripping on the floor to spoil the cleanliness of the room, Tapestries of famous Teir'Dal generals hang on the walls. thier colors depict sometimes battles, sometimes courtevents of long ago. There is one tapestry that stands apart from the others, dominating a wall unto itself. It depicts a large undead army commanded by a giant of a skeleton fighting an undead dragon, Ned always has the furniture facing this tapestry and has it's visage well lit and it is never frayed or dulled in brightness. Some people say Ned IS the commander, but on this, Ned is again silent.<br>
<br>
In the last corner, furthest from the door is Ned's pride and joy, perhaps his very reason to continue living after death. A fully stocked elvenwood bar, complete with four barstools, crystal goblets and decanters and various cups of all sizes for all possible liquors. Every liqour available in Norrath is always stocked somehow, though many would say it impossible to keep all the different types of liquor in Norrath housed in all of Neriak! Upon entering, Ned immediately runs behind the counter and shouts for orders like a no-good barkeep from the froeighn quarter, complete with Human barbarian drawl. &quot;What'll ut be mates!?&quot;. After ordering Ned will tenderly pick up a bar towel, polish every glass, pour the appropriate amount of liquor, lovingly place it on a crystal platte, repeat, then bring the first guest what he had ordered, stand by his chair and watch as he sips it, then laugh excitedly when the patron drinks and tells Ned how astonishlingly wonderful and unparalleled the drink is, which he alwasy does because Ned's drinks always are.<br>
<br>
No one here ever need fear the contents of thier drink. There was never any poison, Ned wouldn't stand for it. Nor was there ever any violence in this room, though all who came here were the typed to be always armed. Again, Ned wouldn't stand for it.<br>
<br>
One man, Orin M'Apex, was rumored to have drawn a blade here once, when the conversation got too heated. Tales tell that Orin was instantly frozen rigid by a spell cast by Ned himself. Later, after the meeting Orin had been a part of finished and the others had left, Ned kept the man and from that day on Orin Ale was available to order. This left many to wonder what became of Orin, and if as they thought, he was the key ingredient in the ale, but when sampled all agreed that the ale was astonishingly good, and no one complained of the trade.<br>
<br>
****<br>
<br>
Tani N'Mar, leader of the Ebon Mask, Patron of house N'Mar , ruler of the backstabbers of the foreign quarter, king of the cutpurses of the commons, and hub upon which the 3rd gate's wheel of espionage and assassinations spun, sat down slowly  at the table in Ned's room among his collegues and ordered a glass of Drom's Champagne. There were seven em; Tani: the guildmaster, Pazin Punnox, in charge of recruitment and job assignment, Vivish S'Lon head of interior promotion, Hekzin G'Zule, Sazan K'Jartan, Yaz Tolax and Molon Tplith, head spy of the Ebon Mask and who only answered to Tani himself.<br>
<br>
All of them sat and ordered, tasting, smiling at the boney host then waiting  for the others. After wich Ned returned to his bar to clean what was all ready impeccable.<br>
<br>
&quot;Comrads, we are here for a purpose, lets be about it,&quot; Tani said to the silence the casual chatting that had begun. All who were presented muttered &quot;Yes milord.&quot; Rare was the opportunity to drink here, and business was hard to concentrate on when in a place so comfortable.<br>
<br>
&quot;We must decide the fate of this Xosha girl. I, being uninformed of her as of yet ask you here assembled to speak of her, and thus we shall see to a conclusion.&quot; Tani spoke like a commander and them men were undyingly faithful to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;She is a brilliant woman milord, adept now at the picks and likely to master all of our training locks soon.,&quot; answered Yaz.<br>
<br>
&quot;But a woman you say,&quot; asked Tani &quot;is she then NOT a child?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No milord,&quot; he replied &quot;she is old enough to be the mother of most of the initiates, but not so old as all of us.&quot; At this last comment they all laughed and then sighed, ruminating on thier own mortality.<br>
<br>
&quot;But if she was so old when she came, what brought her to us? Did she have a profession before?&quot; asked the leader.<br>
<br>
This time is was Molon Tplith who spoke. &quot;She did, yes.&quot;<br>
<br>
All heads turned to Molon. They had not expected him to speak. He did so rarely, and that was generally a whisper in Tani's ear.<br>
<br>
It was Tani who spoke first. &quot;And what profession is that famed thief?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She was a whore me liege.&quot; Molon returned.<br>
<br>
Everyone at the table nodded, Molon was well known amoung the whores, it was where he spent the gratuitous amounts of money he made. All people knew it, and all had stopped caring long ago. A member of the Ebon Council had once tried to argue that it was unheard of for such a noble house as the Ebon Mask to be so shamed by this behavior, but Molon simply put a dagger in the man's eye immediately, and that was that. Besides, Molon was a confirmed bachelor and without house or rank, he did no dishonor to anyone save himself, and it seemed that he could live with that. <br>
<br>
&quot;A whore ehh? What neighborhood?&quot; Tani asked. To be a whore was not necessarily a dishonorable profession to be in Neriak. To serve in the Foreign Quarter, THAT was dishonorable, since your clientel often consisted of humans, gnomes, trolls and ogres. To sleep with another race in as a Teir'Dal was to be unclean, and you were seen as being Teir'Dal at all, rather you had no race. the Moment you layed with another, you were something else, something lower. To work in the commons would satisfy the requirements of being Teir'Dal, since all the customers were poor Tier'Dal workers and young Teir'Dal comming of age, but nothing more. But to be a whore in the 3rd gate was almost a position of prestige, you were more of a courtisan than a prostitute. The 3rd gate had only one whore house, the Maiden's Fancy. It was a bar with a single door in the back. This door was guarded by a large troll with a large club. Rantraz was his name, his job was to prevent any but the richest customers from entering, and to bash any of the customers that DID get in if they didn't treat the women with the dignity, honor and gentleness they deserved. At the 'Fancy the whores' clientel was only the rich and elite of Teir'Dal society, and to bed the rich was a claim that few could make. With that claim came a certain amount of respect and dignity.<br>
<br>
&quot;She was of 3rd gate milord,&quot; answered Molon.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tani sighed &quot;That is well.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And why is it well may I ask?&quot; It was Vivish S'Lon, always the antagonist &quot;This Xosha whorewoman is a murderer. Need I remind you of Quickiron and Lennix?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Here, Here&quot; sounded the others in agreement.<br>
<br>
&quot;Friends, you all know that Quickiron's days were numbered. I think we should THANK Xosha for doing us the favor of removing her for us. Normally such a thing is rewarded, not punished.&quot; Tani reasoned.<br>
<br>
&quot;I concede Quickiron milord,&quot; it was Sazan this time, &quot;but she did kill Lennix, a member of the council, the law is very clear on her fate, and that fate is death by torture.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tani thought about this for a moment and slowly formed his answer. &quot;Hmm, these things are true, but did she not perform Lix'Mey'Frash by every rule, to the letter? There is no mention of &quot;Prey upon the head of a house, but not us please!&quot;, it is very likely she didn't know she was breaking a rule.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I disagree,&quot; said Hekzin G'Zule, who always had a strong head and resonable disposition. When Hekzin spoke he spared no feelings, but spoke the truth as it was. &quot;some rules do not need to be written, the are understood. Is it written anywhere that the moat fish must swim? or that we must kill the halflings invading our forests? Some laws are natural laws. laws that need no quill nor parchment.&quot;<br>
<br>
The others nodded at this and Tani shook his head. It was a weak argument but honestly the men didn't even need one. To kill a member of the council was trouble, and if it weren't punished, the other initiates would start to rebel, thinking that such behavior could go without retribution. Order and rule were well earned with courage, but order and rule were well kept with fear, Tani had always said. It was sad to him, for he knew that Xosha must be the most talented of thieves to have pulled off these killings, not since the fabled Sisters of Iosse had such killings been administered with such a flair and panache. But fear needed to be reinstated, fear of his power.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well, Xosha must die.&quot;<br>
<br>

If she hesitated, Xosha would become entangled in a very short struggle for her life.<br>
<br>
She gathered a few trinkets of magickal power and checked over her inventory of weapons. The bone dirk, with a ragged edge that tore at her prey's muscles and crippled them, secure at her hip. No time for the Rapier, it took to much room to use properly anyway. She opted for her bloodclaw stiletto as a second weapon. Small enough to use in tight spaces, and easy to conceal, she placed it grip-down at the small of her back. She quickly shrugged into the remainder of her ravenscale armor, black as the darkest night. Passing a servant as she left through the front door, she handed him a small note. Instructions would need to be carried out should she not return to her household.<br>
<br>
As she made her way through the city, her thoughts drifted to Dantrazz. How she loved that man...She hoped that he was faring well on his ocean voyage, but she sensed something else was afoot apart from his natural curiosity of the new lands. There would be time to look into that later. For now, Xosha's life hung in the balance.<br>
<br>
She approached the hall of the Ebon Mask and passed around and to the right of the statues flanking its main entrance. Pressing a tiny depression in the rock wall, she made a series of movements too quick for a normal eye to see. A burst of mystikal energies sparked away from the wall and suddenly a passage was open. Morrigu strode into the tunnel and did not even wait to see it close up again behind her. She padded softly down the corridor, familiar with the twists and turn even though it had been many seasons since she had used this old entrance.<br>
<br>
Arriving atthe central chamber deep below she saw very nearly what she had expected, which meant that her informant had been telling her the truth. She was glad that some within the Ebon Mask remembered the old ways of honor among rogues. Xosha was sitting in an ornately carved chair, lashed to it by leather straps. She had obviously struggled when they had come for her, he skin was marred in several plaves by cuts and bruises, now turning a livid purple. A device had been placed into her mouth that resembled a small fruit. Morrigu well know it's origin and function, she had used it on spies many times before. Known as &quot;the Plum&quot; it was a mechanical contrivance that was the apporximate size and shap of the fruit for which it had been named, but was segmented into three equal parts length-wise. At the turn of a screw the three parts would seperate further and further from one another until the whole of the expanded device filled the person's mouth completely, preventing them from speaking at all. If opened all the way the device was easily capable of breaking a person's jaw in several places.<br>
<br>
Tani N'Mar sat silently at an ornate altar, wearing the eyeless hood of the judicator. Morrigu would know the man's form anywhere, even silent and still as he was now. He had been her guildmaster for far too long for her not to know him. Molon stood wearing the ornate traditional mask of Righteous Accusation, making his argument clear before the board of officers of the Jindurn d'Xola or Ebon Mask. <br>
<br>
Morrigu noticed that no one there carried the symbolic Shield of the Defender. Normally at a council trial the accused had the option of speaking for their own defense, but Morrigu knew that gagged as she was Xosha would not be able to utter more than a croak or a rasped cough. To her credit she sat in silent defiance, not giving the council the satisfaction of enjoying her maltreatment. Morrigu then noticed that the shield (a tiny gold jewel-encrusted flimsy thing) was at Xosha's feet, resting against her bound legs. So they were indeed going to sentance her to death, and she was not to be given the chance to defend herself at all. Morrigu gnashed her teeth in silent rage and slipped into the shadows, breathing a single Word of power as she began to move to the front of the room unnoticed by the &quot;best&quot; thieves and cutthroats of Neriak.<br>
<br>
&quot;So you can easily see, Gentlemen and Ladies of the Council,&quot; Molon spoke from behind his mask &quot;that this woman, this ingrate, had continuously defied our authority. She even went so far as to KILL two of our long-standing members without a commission on their heads! In closing, I humbly ask of the council and the Judicator that we sentance this piece of trash to death. Death is what she has earned!&quot;<br>
<br>
A sporadic applause ran through the gathered officers.<br>
<br>
&quot;Does the accused or a member of her defense have any rebuttal?&quot; Tani intoned from behind the eyeless hood.<br>
<br>
Silence dominated the courtroom.<br>
<br>
&quot;All right then, if..&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I believe that there are a few things to be said.&quot; Morrigu spoke, stepping from the shadows and lifting the Shield of the Defender to rest on her left arm.<br>
<br>
Shocked gasps and angry mutters ran throughout the courtroom. Morrigu could swear that beneath the hood Tani N'Mar was breaking a grin.<br>
<br>
&quot;YOU!&quot; Molon cried, &quot;You witch, defiler of our ways, you have no place in this court!&quot;<br>
<br>
Morrigu calmly regarded Molon T'Plith, standing in a relaxed posture and holding her head erect and proud. &quot;Hello, Molon....still enjoying my old job? I WILL speak for the girl, since you seem so eager for her not to speak at all. Does this trouble you? I know the procedures of this court and of the Mask. Am I not still a member of this council, though I have chosen to tend to other business these many years?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I object! I object most strenuously! Lord Judicator, she seeks to make a mockery of our tradition, of these very preceedings, and of yourself, M'Lord!&quot; Molon nearly screamed in his impotent rage.<br>
<br>
&quot;And do you object strongly enough to decide it with Thalra l'sargh d'Vlos, the blood-struggle?&quot; Morrigu raised her eyebrow and looked directly at Molon. When he eventually averted his gaze to the floor she scanned the room to see if any others wanted to speak out. No one met her gaze or even cleared their throats.<br>
<br>
The Judicator spoke. &quot;I believe I will know when anyone in this room attempts to make a mockery of me. Do you yourself have that sense, Lord Accuser? Lady W'Rath has had a distiguished career as one of our most accomplished assassins before she left our service. I think she may continue in her defense of this woman.&quot; He motioned for Morrigu to carry on.<br>
<br>
Morrigu stood tall as she addressed the courtroom. &quot;I have no love of this excessive protocal, so I will be brief. The charges may or may not be true, I care not. The punishment may or may not fit the crimes, again, I care not. We all know that this court has been convened today for purely political reasons.&quot;<br>
<br>
A few nods broke through the court, mostly from those who had not applauded at Molon's closing accusations.<br>
<br>
&quot;Our traditions carry few rules as hard and fast, never meant to be broken. One of these is the Right of Apprenticeship. Molon, be a dear and recite this Right?&quot;<br>
<br>
Molon's body shook in helpless rage, but from behind the mask a voice intoned &quot;Any officer of long-standing within the Ebon Mask may take upon themselves an apprentice from within the ranks of our cadets. This apprentice shall be treated with the same regard as the Officer themself, and any wrongdoings of either shall fall upon the head of both. No harm shall come to the Apprentice save that the Officer shall pay equally.&quot;<br>
<br>
Morrigu nodded her head. &quot;Very good, Molon, I see that SOME good has come of that dagger's hilt rammed up your ass... I have been long without an apprentice. Many of you remember the mad Xandriel, and the gap between then and now has left me...lonely. I have chosen Xosha as my apprentice, and I will be responsible for her education from her on out. She is now under my allegiance and protection. Now, who among you feel like putting ME in that chair?&quot; Morrigu casually pointed to Xosha where she sat.<br>
<br>
Again, silence dominated the courtroom. Molon T'Plith shook like the dog he was in place, but did not utter a sound. Morrigu set down the Shield of the Defender upon the altar and strode over to the chair where Xosha still sat bound.<br>
<br>
&quot;I thought not. And now, Lords and Ladies of the Mask, we take our leave of you. Goodbye.&quot;<br>
<br>
Morrigu casually cut the cords holding Xosha and gingerly assisted her to her feet. Unable to stand due to the lack of blood in her legs, Xosha nealy collapsed before Morrigu lifted her like a kitten into her arms and walked quietly out of the room. The gathered members of the Mask let out a collective sigh or relief, for bloodshed on a large scale had been narrowly averted. Not a single one of them had wanted to be on the business end of Morrigu's blades. None of them, of course, save one.<br>
<br>
&quot;This court stands adjourned!&quot; Tani said as he removed his hood. &quot;Molon, old boy, I think you grow smarter in your middle age...when Morrigu held your job you were constantly testing her. I think you avoided death today by holding your tongue, yes?&quot; Tani chuckled as he left the room.<br>
<br>
Molon T'Plith let the mask fall from his face and to the floor, striking with a dull thud. He was the last person in the room and he stared directly at the wall and spoke to no one in particular.<br>
<br>
&quot;One day, Lady, one day I shall have the blood I sought from you so long ago. And you, Tani...best to watch carefully for your death....I will be master of the Mask one day....one day....&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/uxosha.showPublicProfile>Xosha</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br>   <font color=#939393>(4/12/00 1:31:39 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Lessons of the Redhand</span><hr size=1> /OOC sorry for all the complex gramar and mispellings, I wrote this late at night directly onto the board, without writing it down first and proofreading<br>
<br>
&quot;Again!&quot; Screamed Morrigu the Redhand. &quot;All wrong! Dammit Xosha what the hell do I have to tell you to get you to understand? It's Right-Dodge-Left-Parry-Insert below the thigh-Cut upwards!&quot; <br>
<br>
Xosha, newly appointed apprentice to Master Redhand nodded, and clenched her nouth in concentration. The sharp bars that were Morrigu's comments stung her when they had started Xosha's apprenticeship, two weeks ago, but now, Xosha heard in them the ring of truth, and the power that could be achieved if headed. So she did. Xosha listened when belittled for she knew that Morrigu was right, she was doing it wrong. <br>
<br>
They were sparring in the arena of Qeynos of all places. The journey had been a strange and long one from the halls of High Keep, where the Tier'Dal race was sometimes tolerated, but never liked. Here they had met after Morrigu had told her that her apprenticeship had begun. Xosha was in the bar when they had met, drinking slowly as she always did, and looking at the door. She wanted to make sure Morrigu didn't slip past her, for to be caught on awares was the very death of an assassin, that atleast Xosha knew first hand. <br>
<br>
She was so eager to see her teacher enter that when the touch at her shoulder came she jumped like a cowardly puppy. Then without thinking she drew her blade and spun. Her spin was met by a hard striking to the face, and next thing Xosha knew she was face first on the wooden flooring of that High Hold bar with Morrigu looking down at her. &quot;Wrong child, all wrong...&quot; <br>
<br>
Later, they had started thier journey into Qeynos, when Xosha was at last able to use her mouth again. &quot;Master Redhand, why Qeynos? Is it not the city of dogs? I have heard nothing of it's importance to the...&quot; Xosha was silenced by a chill look from Morrigu. <br>
<br>
&quot;I WAS going to tell you, now I think I'd rather YOU tell me, and if you are wrong, I'll leave you in Qeynos to find your answers yourself.&quot; Morrigu replied contritely. <br>
<br>
This time Xosha held her tongue and nodded. <br>
<br>
It was a moment later that a young wood elf crossed thier paths. A pretty thing she was, full of innocence and stupidity and love. Xosha drew her weapons immediately. She faced the Fier'Dal with hate in her eyes and Innoruuk's prayers on her lips. <br>
<br>
Morrigu turned to Xosha instantly, cuffed her behind the head, and then turned to the treehugger. &quot;Spare a spirit of the wolf for my traveling companion and I?&quot; asked the Matroness. <br>
<br>
The treehugger was doubtful at first, obviously her elders had told her of the evils of the true race, but her ignorance and her disgusting love won over eventually and she smiled and began her casting. <br>
<br>
A minute later the wood elf was off, Xosha watched her go in confusion. <br>
<br>
&quot;Master Redhand...&quot; Xosha stopped herself, almost unsure of whether to ask. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes apprentice?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Master, excuse my impudence, but may I ask of thee a humble question?&quot; Xosha bowed her head as she spoke. <br>
<br>
&quot;Better. Your answer is this. The effects of this spell last many hours and we have much land to cover to get to Qeynos. We are assassins and our ways are those of deception, not of quick spirited earthy worship. We use the Fier'Dal by playing on her weakness, in this case, her love, and we gain from it.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes master.&quot; <br>
<br>
In a half hour Morrigu turned a ways from thier path into a small copse of woods with a stream flowing through it. A soft humming could be heard inside. Before her curious student could even ask Morrigu shushed her and motioned for her to follow, keeping to the shadows and watching to not step on twigs or anything that would reveal thier location. At the bank of the stream was the pretty Fier'Dal druid, washing her tunic in the water and singing some damned song to Tunare. Morrigu slowly crept to her, on all fours, with her bone dirk in her mouth. When she was near enough to touch the elf she rose to her feet, and tapped the Fier'Dal on the shoulder. The woman turned to see a dirk in her stomach. When she died she had such a look of confusion and fear of death. <br>
<br>
Later, in that same grove Xosha ventured into a dangerous territory and asked. &quot;But master, the wood elf was out of our way, we have wasted time in tracking her. Why this killing?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Child you have very much to learn. Would Innoruuk have forgiven me for allowing such a good deed as that one did for us to go unpunished? We have now gained in two ways, our trip was sped by the spell, and our master was praised by her death.&quot; Xosha smiled... <br>
<br>
&quot;Will you show me that trick that you did to her Master?&quot; <br>
<br>
Morrigu grinned widely. &quot;Yes, in the arena, in Qeynos. There is much for you to learn. To be MY apprentice you will need to kill. And you will need to kill like an assassin. You fight like a barbarian warrior, it is sick. But now, now I think maybe you are ready for my lessons.&quot; <br>
<br>
The two linked arms and sped thier wolf spirited feet towards the land of dogs and cowards, to Qeynos. <br>
