&nbsp It’s odd really…. the feeling of emptiness. Tears at your soul, your mind, everything about you, your consumed by the feeling of nothingness and loneliness. I have fought this all my life, try as I might to bury it, to hide it, to keep it from the eyes of those around me, it’s always there…eating…chewing…gnawing away at me. Whenever I see a young one hug their father, or a couple holding hands, or brothers laughing and joking with one another, that’s when it hurts the most. I guess I should introduce myself, I am Crystallian Imperium, I am what is known as a holy knight, or paladin as many have come to call us. I follow the divine wisdom and enlightenment of The Rainkeeper, Karana. The duty I have been charged with is to spread his word throughout all these lands, which we call Norrath, hoping to awaken all those who have never heard the words that he offers. My blade is used only in defense, for there are those who react violently towards me, and my ideas. But none of this matters, none of this is important really. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I was told I was found as an infant, upon the shores of the small Lake Vie in the hills outside the city of Qeynos. You see, I am what is known as a half-elf, half human, half elf, though that is a rather tame term compared to what many call us. In the adopted society of Norrath, half-elves are embarrassments, nobody proudly claims half-elven heirs. So many of my kind are simply abandoned such as I was by uncaring and unloving parents to die in the wilderness. Luckily, I was found, I was found by a contingent of knights from the Order of Thunder back in Qeynos. As dedicated followers of Karana, they took me in, raised me in the teachings and ways of Karana. I was raised in isolation, never allowed to leave the temple grounds for the fears that other ideas get put in my head at such a young, impressionable age. So my childhood was spent reading scripture, listening to sermons, and performing menial tasks around the temple. This was the only life I knew, I had never seen anything outside the temple or anywhere. Eventually it became time for me to learn the ways of the blade. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I was much smaller then any of the others. Most of the others were kids sent to the Temple by parents who simply didn’t want to deal with them anymore, and figured this was the best way to teach them discipline. They were mostly local human kids from the city, some might have turned out all right, I don’t really know, but it doesn’t really matter. I was easily manhandled and defeated in most of the physical exercises we were forced to do. I was no match for the bigger, stronger human kids. I suffered many a bruise and broken bone during this time in my life, but there was one thing I took away from that, and that was to never give up. It was never how many times I went down, it was how many times I got back up. Eventually, as time moved on I became bigger, stronger, quicker. I had gained the ability to fight effectively, and this coupled with the lessons I had learned as a child of Karana, and his teachings forged me into the knight that I am today.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And that was that really. Not long after I was knighted they branded my arm with the insignia of the Order and sent me out into the unknown world, to spread the word of Karana. There are many adventures I could speak of within that time, but none really matter. I look at others, and I see emotion, I see feeling, I have none of that. I see the love between a father and son,  I don’t have that. I see affection, I see anger, I see happiness, I see it all. But all I feel in myself is a black, empty hole. Every emotion has been stripped away, I have been taught not to feel them. But I do…I feel loneliness…and it’s all I ever feel.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sometimes I wonder where they are, whom they are, why they left me to die. I wonder why they let me be raised by those who didn’t really care, and whom in their eyes all that they could see was another crusader, another soldier for their religious cause. And then the loneliness returns, and the hole grows wider, and darker. My entire life has been preset for me; I have no choice, no emotion, no anything. I repeat words and phrases drilled in my head by others, I have been told all my life what to think and how to act, and I can’t do any different. As I write this, I reflect on what I’ve done, and I’ve seen that I have done nothing at all; all I have done is serve the will of others. I don’t know how to change; I don’t know how to feel. I am trapped in myself, my body is my cell and I can’t escape, ever. And as I think about that, the hole expands, and the pain I feel in my heart intensifies, there is no way out…but I cant think about this now because it only hurts, perhaps this writ will be found someday by someone. And they will know what a knight feels, pain and emptiness. And it won’t go away….<br>
