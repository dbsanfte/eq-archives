I had a vision of a chat channel for pick up raids. I used to play Everquest on the Torvonilious server and at that time nearly everyone was bound or gathered around Karnors castle. So that people could use the Druid and Wizard  kunark evacuation spells. Every couple of hours people would come and ask for help and I really enjoyed doing one of tough mobs.<br>
<br>
With the bazaar and chat channels there is no equivalent place on servers now. We cannot plan raids on the 55 plus 3 to 5 group mobs. They are killed within 2 or 3 hours of spawning. These Dragon and Velious and Luclin zone bosses or sub bosses, ALWAYS drop high end spells and Uber equipment. Is Scarab a planned raid organisation and everyone is satisfied with the present operation, or are there people like me who would like to co operate on pick up raids for the short term buzz of killing Dragons like Gorenaire. If there is no interest among present members or people feel that is not the purpose of scarab that is fine.<br>
<br>
I will go to the main AB web site and try to set up a pick up channel, so people can shout come give me a hand with this mob, I need this item but anything else is random roll. I never won a random roll but i rearly enjoyed the buzz of a fast action high risk kill and that was with 90% res, with a 96% res the sky or Trak, rumble or Zelnikar is the limit))), and we can help people race through their epic mobs. I would like your feedback .<br>

<br>
Pickups raids like the ones you describe are necessary for certain mobs. Additionally, it would make epic mob fights a lot easier to arrange since you could recruit people on the fly (or add a few to the roster you already have from sign-ups to make the fight a sure overkill <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>

With often 20+ people on the Scarab channel there would be a good base to form a pickup raid.  Even if only 50% of them were not busy there's the two groups worth right there. <p><p>

As already mentioned above many mobs have obscene respawn cycles and are usually killed quickly after they pop. So a traditional raid with the aim of killing one of those is bound to either make people sit around for a very long time or even fail at all. So this would enable scarab members to take part in something close to insta-action. Nice thought.<br>
<br>
But I guess this makes the scarab rule of people 'hiring' scarab members for raid points somewhat obsolete - something I can personally live with <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

If the Scarab loot rules are followed (i.e. NBG, can and will use, only scarab members may loot, bid system on points etc) and each scarab member gets say 1 point for the event then where is the problem.<br>
<br>
People would be rewarded for effort put in (although less than a lengthy raid) and a chance to spend points on good loot (which is lacking at the moment IMO).<br>
<br>
The one issue I see is that you would need to set a rule about the type of mob you go after. For example you could exploit it by organising an event to go kill Lord Crush just to get the point. Maybe you could only be awarded a point from such an event when someone spends points on a looted item. This way the event has to be worth doing for the loot. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=186665">Thug - 60 War</A>

<br>
As fas as I understood Boldir, he did not want to restrict this pickup raid channel to SCARAB, so there would be fair chance that several non-members are present. As soon as this happens on a pickup raid, I do not think it would be fair to say &quot;you are not a member and not allowed to loot&quot; (especially when the &quot;guests&quot; make this raid possible in the first place).<br>
<br>
As soon as there are only SCARAB members present, we could treat this raid according to our standard rules. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bscarab5467.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thugstump>Thugstump</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(12/11/02 16:16)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fscarab5467frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=63.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Short notice pick up raids, is there any interest?</span><hr size=1> Fair enough if Boldir wants to make it an open invite, then it is a standard pick-up job. I just think that Scarab is (hopefully) getting to the stage where we have enough people online most of the time that it would be possible to do this type of ad-hoc event as a Scarab thing.<br>
<br>
After all part of the reason some people join Scarab is to raid places and mobs their guild alone would struggle with. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=186665">Thug - 60 War</A>

<br>
1. Pick up raids<br>
<br>
They are a great idea. I have been doing pick up raids a lot in the last three months (since leaving my old guild) and the result has always been at the same time fun and instructive. So yes, I like the idea and yes, I think opening it to non Scarab members really makes sense. The way I have done it in the past is usually the following : I do a pick up with friends list and friends guilds, and then could do a sentence on the Scarab chat list to see of folk want to join.<br>
<br>
I personnally (but this is just my opinion of course) love the fact that in Scarab, there is an open attitude to &quot;folk from the outside&quot; and I find it a very refreshing attitude to what you have in some gulids. So I do feel a bit uneasy about, for example, doing a pick up raid in a Scarab way and not being able to invite friends who are not members of Scarab.<br>
<br>
In such pick up raids, I actually personnally would not consider the looting system and points as applicable : these are spur of the moment decisions, unofficial, open to all people in Norrath and friends outside Scarab should be able to attend : as such, attributing points and using the points system for loot is, in my opinion not necessary. <br>
<br>
Of course, I am more a social player than one intent on loot, but promoting diversity is something I feel a lot about and what I like a lot with Scarab : why restict it to Scarab only ?<br>
<br>
2. Scarab raids<br>
<br>
This does not prevent normal Scarab raids in any way ; in that way there are Official Scarab Raids, with advertisement, points, restriction on attendance, loot rules, and then there are Spontaneous Pick Up raids which can have other loot rules, no points and so on. Which leads me to 3.<br>
<br>
3. Rule for spending points to &quot;Hire&quot; folks.<br>
<br>
I personnally am unsure about this idea. For example, it makes little sense to me that Karolusx had to spend all his points because he organised a raid that got him the Epic Piece. In my opinion, he spent time and effort to provide us with an entertaining evening and should be rewarded for this. I personnally would be quite happy to help any one with epics, quests and the like, and would feel a bit sad if the amount of Epic Raids or mini raids would be reduced because people are afraid to be losing points or feeling hiring Scarab people kind of costs them something. I know this kind of personnally leads me to use other sources of help when planning, for example, to get my epic pieces, Scarab then becoming a last ressource in case all else would fail, since the current rule kind of makes me feel it is in a sense &quot;wrong&quot; to do that.<br>

I just wanted to point out that I was not forced by anyone to spend the raid points, not in person and not by the rules. If you plan a raid for an epic drop, this item will go to you, of course, no question (this is also reflected in the rules). Spending the points was my personal decision because:<br>

- I forgot to sort out this specific drop beforehand by talking to the other clerics on the raid <br>

<br>
Typically, you log onto EQ with a very specific idea of what you are about to do that night, so most people are usually busy in some way.<br>
<br>
If you want to start a pickup raid, you either need a very large base of players to draw from (to catch those who are free at the moment, soloing, bored etc.) or a group of spontaneous people that are willing to stop what they are doing at the moment to go on a raid. But once you start, for example, a group, many people feel that they make some sort of commitment and tend to stick with it for at least a while (which is not bad, imho :) ).<br>
<br>
On a typical night, there are 10 to 20 people in the scarab channel, so this could never be the only place for picking up people at the moment. There is a way, however, if we consider that many of us come from totally different guilds and a way to go would be to place calls like 'Please pass on the word to your friends/guilds ...". <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bscarab5467.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rularkdarkbane>rulark darkbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(12/15/02 2:17)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fscarab5467frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=63.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Short notice pick up raids, is there any interest?</span><hr size=1> im all for pickups gets kinda boring soloing all the time,but as runemoon says you do kinda plan ahead what u are doing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
The one aspect where there was some disagreement was how open the pickup raid should be. If we had 50 plus members of SCARAB on line at peak times and SCARAB was mostly 55 plus players I could see a restriction to SCARAB only working. I have tried on three occasions to get a pickup raid started and the most response I have had is from 3 players. With that number to go against Gorenaire, you would be leading a Kamikaze raid, with certain failure. As a family team we have helped several people on the 55 level mobs, where a small pickup group is much better with a lot less organising, minimum down time and more fun in achieving something. My original suggestion was to enable us to hit the bigger 60 plus rare spawn mobs on the server and for that we need 15 to 20 plus players, especially if we have a 50 plus raid policy.<br>
<br>
I take Silds point about bad pickup raids being a disaster. I for one was scammed on the last server on quite a few Vox and Naggy raids, where all the loot was suddenly allocated to the leaders or their friends. On one Vox raid I had my worst experience on Everquest, the raid started at 10.30pm and we finally recovered all the corpses at 9.15am the following morning.<br>
<br>
This leads on to rules I am not a person who likes too many rules, and one reason I have found most Everquest guilds not to my liking is the clique that forms with officer only forums (only he can lead raids, the officers council will decide who is worthy of No Drop loot etc). I do not like all that crap and one reason I am committed to SCARAB is the complete openness we have. However if we are to develop pickup raids and make them popular again under the SCARAB banner. There is a need for rules, this is to ensure fair distribution of loot and have a reference so people know the rules when they join a Scarab pickup group. There is also the need to maintain the reputation and credibility of SCARAB on the server; otherwise the hard work of building SCARAB up will soon be lost with a few disastrous raids.<br>
<br>
This is my idea of a minimal rules format, please feel free to give your own opinions and reduce or extend the basis of the rules, but this at least can be a starting point.<br>
<br>
RULES FOR SCARAB PICKUP RAIDS<br>
<br>
1) Only full members of SCARAB can organise and lead a pickup raid organised under the SCARAB banner and rules.<br>
2) The raid will be open to who ever the Leader chooses to invite, but all SCARAB members in game at the time of the announcement will have the right to attend.<br>
3) The Leader will give a clear estimate of the time required, ideal minimum level and the degree of risk.<br>
4) Only special items relating to Quests can be reserved by the Leader the rest will be considered random loot.<br>
5) The basis for rolling on the loot will be NEED BEFORE GREED.<br>
6) A player can win only one piece of loot per raid. (A player with more than one account cannot keep rolling with an alternate character if they have already won a piece of equipment/spell).<br>
7) No raid will be started by a Leader unless they can offer all participants a minimum 90% res and if in a high risk area have organised some method of corpse retrieval.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I feel that is a simple basis to work on and hope to get your feedback, so we can all increase the fun content of the game.<br>
<br>
Many Thanks<br>

<br>
&quot;As many rules as necessary, as few as possible&quot; is something I like to see too.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, you already covered the most important points in this ruleset:<br>
<br>
- Openness: this must be preserved as this is one of the points that sets SCARAB apart from other &quot;organizations&quot;. Everyone should be able to request help, host raids etc. and item distribution should be as fair as possible.<br>
<br>
- Open raids should not mean, however, that there is no safety plan or fallback procedure if things go wrong (i.e. the RL should make sure that CR is safe in terms of rezzes, summons etc.).<br>
<br>
- The RL must have the option to open the raid even further, i.e. include non-SCARAB members, as it would be near impossible to host such a raid from SCARAB alone at the moment.<br>
