<br>
_______________________________________________________<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Marina crossed the platform in the city of Kelethin with her head held high despite<br>
                      the whispers that<br>
                      followed her. The days of hanging her head around the woodelven folk who inhabited<br>
                      the city were long<br>
                      gone. This was her home, her place of solace. And so much the worse for the those<br>
                      who thought she<br>
                      didn't belong here any longer. <br>
<br>
                      She had been born here in the city to parents who were very involved in the defense<br>
                      of the city when the<br>
                      orcs had moved into the forests. Her mother, a powerful druid, had been assured at<br>
                      Marina's birth that she<br>
                      now had the child who would follow in her footsteps and protect all the Mother had<br>
                      created. She began<br>
                      teaching Marina the ways of the druids almost before she was out of the cradle.<br>
                      Unfortunately Marina had<br>
                      little, if any aptitude in the ways of spells and such. The day she set her mothers<br>
                      best tablecloth on fire<br>
                      while trying to light a candle set on the cloth was the day Marina discovered the<br>
                      path that was laid out for<br>
                      her by the Gods, who hadn't consulted Marina's mother in the decision...obviously. <br>
<br>
                      After the incident with the tablecloth, Marina's mother sent her out to play while she<br>
                      cleaned up the mess.<br>
                      Marina happily scampered up the many ramps and across the bridges to the platform<br>
                      which held the<br>
                      Scout's guild hall. There she knew she would find her father, a woodelven Scout of<br>
                      Tunare. Her father's<br>
                      &quot;job&quot; had always seemed so mysterious to Marina. As she approached the guild hall,<br>
                      she saw her father<br>
                      striding towards her and quickly ducked into the shadows surrounding anther building<br>
                      close by. As he<br>
                      passed her by without so much as a glance in her direction, she decided to play her<br>
                      favorite game. Moving<br>
                      in the way she had seen her father and other Scout's move, she followed her father<br>
                      to the top of the lift<br>
                      which would take him to the forest. Just as he was about to step onto the lift, she<br>
                      grabbed hold of his<br>
                      long cape. The next thing she knew she was on the ground beneath her father with<br>
                      his dagger at her<br>
                      throat. The look of surprise on her face was mirrored on the face of her father. As he<br>
                      helped her to her<br>
                      feet, he said &quot;You must be careful, my young one, you are lucky that I recognized<br>
                      you before I drove the<br>
                      dagger home.&quot; He then told her to run home and gather her things and present<br>
                      herself to the Scout's for<br>
                      training. He then stepped onto the lift and descended into the forest below. <br>
<br>
                      Marina's mother was most dismayed by this unexpected turn of events and accused<br>
                      Marina of not trying<br>
                      hard enough to learn the ways of the druid. She told Marina &quot;No daugher of mine and<br>
                      certainly no lady<br>
                      would ever presume to become a ROGUE. Henceforth, you will have no mother and I<br>
                      no daughter.&quot; Marina<br>
                      gathered her few belonging and ran from the house crying. <br>
<br>
                      But her life was to be even more disrupted on this day. When she returned to the<br>
                      guild hall, it was in an<br>
                      uproar. One of their own had been discovered in the company of the leaders of the<br>
                      Orc company. A Scout<br>
                      of Tunare had been seen leading Emporer Crush and the Dark Elven Ambassador<br>
                      D'Vinn around the forest<br>
                      outside the walls of Crushbone. And it was her father. When Marina was finally able<br>
                      to get the attention of<br>
                      the guild master and tell him that her father had sent her, he told her &quot;We accept<br>
                      not the spawn of<br>
                      traitors, now be gone. Before we deliver to you the same fate as we did your father.&quot;<br>
                      With those words,<br>
                      the ties that bound Marina to the city of Kelethin and the Scouts of Tunare were<br>
                      broken and she left the<br>
                      forests of Faydark to make her own way in the lands of Norrath. Now when she<br>
                      returned to Kelethin, it was<br>
                      as a daughter of the world and a rogue who knew no alliance except that of the<br>
                      friendships she had<br>
                      formed along the way. <p>Luck in the Shadows,<br>

Training was difficult to say<br>
                      the least since she<br>
                      had no alliance with any of the established rogue guilds in Norrath. She picked up<br>
                      bits and pieces of<br>
                      information from older rogues and hid in corners of guild halls listening to others<br>
                      receive their instruction to<br>
                      learn her craft. But she had yet to learn the art of pickpocketing. She knew that this<br>
                      skill would serve her<br>
                      well, being alone in the world, but everytime she was caught and forced to flee for<br>
                      her life. It was after<br>
                      one such humilating episode that she met another rogue. One who was to become<br>
                      her mentor, her friend,<br>
                      and eventually her love. <br>
<br>
                      As she fled for her very life once again, a strong arm grabbed her around the waist<br>
                      and pulled her into a<br>
                      shadowy corner. She struggled until a deep, calm voice whispered in her ear, &quot;Do not<br>
                      be afraid and do not<br>
                      move. I shall return to you in a moment.&quot; With that the body she had been pressed<br>
                      up against was gone.<br>
                      She caught the glimmer of light on blades and nothing more. <br>
<br>
                      Marina started slipping through the shadows. There was no way that she was going<br>
                      to stand still and wait<br>
                      to be caught in a trap. She was taken by complete surprise when an iron grip<br>
                      grabbed her arm. &quot;I believe I<br>
                      told you not to move, my little thief&quot;, the same deep voice said. &quot;I am no thief&quot;,<br>
                      Marina was barely able to<br>
                      keep herself from screaming. She tried to struggle but to no avail, she was caught<br>
                      fast. &quot;Come with me<br>
                      and keep quiet. It is not safe for either of us here&quot;, the voice spoke again into her<br>
                      ear. Holding her arm<br>
                      tightly, he fairly dragged her up one street and down another always keeping to the<br>
                      shadows. <br>
<br>
                      Eventually, after so many twists and turns that she was completely lost, he opened<br>
                      a door and led her into<br>
                      a small building. When he struck a match to light a lamp, Marina saw the face of her<br>
                      captor for the first<br>
                      time. He was another woodelf, like herself, although he carried himself with the<br>
                      bearing of one born to the<br>
                      nobility. &quot;Why have you brought me here?&quot; Marina questioned the man. &quot;And who are<br>
                      you?&quot; <br>
<br>
                      &quot;I am one like yourself who walks the shadows. You are good, little thief, but I will<br>
                      make you better.&quot; <br>
<br>
                      &quot;And why would you help me?&quot;, Marina asked. <br>
<br>
                      &quot;To repay a debt to the one who took me in and raised me to what you see now.<br>
                      You may call me<br>
                      Cerawyn. And now, my pretty little thief, you should sleep because tomorrow your<br>
                      training truly begins&quot; <p>Luck in the Shadows,<br>

She had gained sufficient skill<br>
                      to be allowed to go<br>
                      hunting on her own. As she had not yet gained his expertise, they could not hunt<br>
                      together but both<br>
                      always returned, sooner or later, to the small home they had created in the city. <br>
<br>
                      As Marina pushed open the door, her eyes scanned the room. Her disappointment<br>
                      would have shown<br>
                      clearly if anyone was there to see. No trace of Cerawyn was to be found, just a note<br>
                      on the small table. <br>
<br>
                      Marina, <br>
<br>
                      Find the bard named Silquendil. He holds for you a reminder of how much your<br>
                      training has progressed. <br>
<br>
                      Cerawyn <br>
<br>
                      Marina had heard Cerawyn speak of this bard before but always with a trace of anger<br>
                      in his voice.<br>
                      Apparently he was something of a drunkard . &quot;Why would the bard have something<br>
                      for me?&quot; she wondered.<br>
                      Replacing the few pieces of armor that she had removed, she headed back out the<br>
                      door and to the tavern.<br>
                      If the bard wasn't there now, he would be soon. <br>
<br>
                      Marina was correct. She had barely ordered her honey mead and chosen a seat<br>
                      where she could observe<br>
                      the door without being readily noticed, when in walked a bard. When he approached<br>
                      the barkeep, she<br>
                      stood and moved in behind him. Dropping a platinum coin of the bar, she said &quot;Give<br>
                      him what he wants and<br>
                      keep them coming.&quot; To the bard, she said &quot;Come and sit with me, songweaver, and<br>
                      perhaps you can tell<br>
                      me a tale.&quot; The young bard, already swaying slightly on his feet, followed her to the<br>
                      table. <br>
<br>
                      Once seated with his drink in front of him, the bard asked &quot;What story would you like<br>
                      to hear, m'lady?&quot; <br>
<br>
                      &quot;First I must know if you are the one called Silquendil, and don't call me a lady.&quot; <br>
<br>
                      &quot;Aye that be my name, m'lady.&quot; The bard continued as if he had not heard the<br>
                      second part of Marina's<br>
                      statement. <br>
<br>
                      Unconsiously, Marina let a dagger slide from her sleeve. &quot;I said do not call me a lady,<br>
                      no lady&quot; the title was spoken with a sneer, &quot;does what I do and takes such pride in<br>
                      her work&quot; <br>
<br>
                      The bard eyed the dagger warily, drained his tankard and waved to the barkeep for<br>
                      more. Marina spoke<br>
                      again, &quot;I was told to find you, that you had something for me.&quot; <br>
<br>
                      Silquendil looked at her blankly for a moment and then the light of recognition shown<br>
                      in his eyes. &quot;Ahhhh,&quot;<br>
                      he exclaimed, &quot;you would be Cerawyn's love?&quot; <br>
<br>
                      Now it was Marina's turn to stare. &quot;What did you say?&quot; she was finally able to ask. &quot;I<br>
                      was approached by a<br>
                      man named Cerawyn who told me to hold this gift for his love who would come<br>
                      seeking it. I don't know, he<br>
                      something about he and I being family or some such thing&quot;, the bard rambled. &quot;So are<br>
                      you this Cerawyn's<br>
                      love? There is a message that is to go with dagger but I'm to speak it to no one but<br>
                      her.&quot; <br>
<br>
                      &quot;I....I.....I don't know. He's never spoken to me of love but the note he left<br>
                      instructed me to find you, that<br>
                      you held a remembrance of my training. <br>
<br>
                      &quot;Then your name would be Marina? The green eyes are right and I can't see much in<br>
                      this dim light but the<br>
                      hair looks to be a soft red color like he described.&quot; the bard muttered to himself. With<br>
                      that he placed a<br>
                      dagger on the table and slid it towards Marina. Marina looked at it and knew it for<br>
                      what it was. A Scout's<br>
                      Blade. &quot;And the message?&quot; she questioned. <br>
<br>
                      &quot;Ahhh yes. Now what was the message? Hmmmmmm. Oh yes, I remember. That you<br>
                      are to take the blade<br>
                      and use it proudly. Keep it to remember him by if he should not return. He is going on<br>
                      a journey that he has<br>
                      needed to make for a long time. Now the time is right but the way is dangerous. He<br>
                      does not think he will<br>
                      able to return to you and show you how he feels.&quot; Silquendil said, &quot;He also bade me<br>
                      tell you that you<br>
                      should keep yourself safe and that he is proud of you.&quot; <p>Luck in the Shadows,<br>

                      muscles as the oils she had added helped to ease her mind. Her thoughts turned<br>
                      again to the words the bard had said were Cerawyn's. Love? Could it be true? But he<br>
                      was a Scout and a proud one at that. Would he still feel love, if he felt it at all, after<br>
                      he knew of her past and the charges made against her father? Marina still did not<br>
                      believe that her father was guilty but had yet to gain sufficient skills to find out the<br>
                      truth.<br>
<br>
                      The water was becoming decidedly cool when she stopped her thinking. Grabbing a<br>
                      brush from a nearby table, she began to brush out her hair. Suddenly a noise in the<br>
                      other room made her stop. Someone was opening the door and trying to be<br>
                      extremely quiet about it. Stepping out of the tub, she grabbed her shift and pulled it<br>
                      on over her head. Padding to the bed, she picked up the daggers she had dropped<br>
                      there. Moving to the door, she could hear footsteps moving towards her. But not<br>
                      ordinary footsteps, these were the almost silent footsteps of another rogue.<br>
<br>
                      As the door opened, Marina readied her daggers. When a man entered the room, she<br>
                      moved to plunge one if not both daggers into his back. She was extremely surprised<br>
                      when he sidestepped her attack and turned to her. &quot;It seems, little one, that you<br>
                      always feel the need to attack me.&quot; Cerawyn said with a grin. The grin quickly faded<br>
                      as his eyes traveled down Marina's body. Looking down herself to see what had<br>
                      caused the change in his expression, Marina quickly turned her back to him. This was<br>
                      definitely not how she had pictured their reunion.<br>
<br>
                      She was surprised to feel his hands on her shoulder until she realized that he was<br>
                      placing his cloak around her. Still holding her shoulders, he turned to face him once<br>
                      more. Marina's eyes were locked on the floor but with a finger beneath her chin, he<br>
                      raised her face. Green eyes met blue and Marina felt as if she were melting. Gently<br>
                      tracing his thumb along her jaw, he brought his head down to hers. Just as Marina<br>
                      closed her eyes in anticipation, he let her go so abruptly that she nearly fell.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;I'm sorry&quot;, was all he said.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;Sorry? Then the words that the bard spoke were not true?&quot; Marina asked.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;What exactly did he say?<br>
<br>
                      &quot;He gave me a Scout's blade, he said you were making a dangerous journey, and…..&quot;<br>
                      Marina's voice trailed off.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;And?&quot; prompted Cerawyn. He could not remember asking Silquendil to tell her<br>
                      anything else.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;He said you loved me.&quot; Marina said, pulling his cloak more tightly about her.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;By the Gods, can't the young fool do anything right?&quot; Cerawyn shouted. Rigid with<br>
                      anger, he paced the room. A small sound made him turn and look at the woman<br>
                      across the room. Tears coursed down her face as she tried to fight them. Her hands<br>
                      were balled into fists so hard surely the nails must be biting into the palms. More<br>
                      carefully than he had approached anything on his journey, he came to Marina. Taking<br>
                      one hand, he softly pried the fist open and led her to a soft chair. Sitting her down,<br>
                      he said &quot;Marina, you must listen me to now. The words the bard spoke were true. I'm<br>
                      angry because he wasn't meant to say them to you. If I had not returned, knowing<br>
                      that I had loved you would have caused you pain and I don't ever want to be the<br>
                      cause of your pain. I was also afraid to tell you, afraid that you would not return my<br>
                      feelings.&quot;<br>
<br>
                      Standing to face him, Marina said softly &quot;You couldn't see how I felt?&quot; as she raised<br>
                      up on her toes and pressed her lips to his, his cloak falling to the ground. <p>Luck in the Shadows,<br>

She felt a shudder run through his<br>
                      body just before he<br>
                      placed his hands gently on her shoulders and pushed her back down into the chair.<br>
                      Stooping to retrieve his<br>
                      fallen cloak, his eyes ran over her barely covered form once again. Placing the cloak<br>
                      back around her, he<br>
                      crossed the room to avoid the temptation of pulling her down onto the floor with him.<br>
                      Taking several deep<br>
                      breaths to calm the emotions racing through him, he turned to face her and was<br>
                      stunned to see the look<br>
                      of fury on her face. <br>
<br>
                      &quot;You're angry with me&quot;, he stated in a low voice. <br>
<br>
                      Her green eyes were as hard and cold as any emerald he had ever seen. &quot;Aye, I'm<br>
                      angry. You claim love for<br>
                      me and then push me away as if I'm not good enough to touch you. Is it because I<br>
                      have no desire to join<br>
                      with the murderous Scouts of Tunare? Well let me tell you a few things about your<br>
                      precious Scouts. They<br>
                      murdered a good man and a proud Scout from a distance without benefit of a<br>
                      hearing. They branded him a<br>
                      traitor and took his life without asking what his explanations were. They turned this<br>
                      man's young child<br>
                      away from the guild and the city with threats against her life and the words 'Traitor's<br>
                      Spawn' ringing in her<br>
                      ears. They put her out into the world to earn her living without benefit of any<br>
                      training. They left her at the<br>
                      mercy of those who would use her or cause her harm.&quot; <br>
<br>
                      Cerawyn was stunned by this tirade. He had no knowledge of the events she spoke<br>
                      of. Who was this man<br>
                      and his child? Obviously it was someone very close to Marina for it to have affected<br>
                      her this way. <br>
<br>
                      &quot;Well I have a message for your precious Scouts of Tunare&quot;, she spat at Cerawyn,<br>
                      &quot;You tell them that the<br>
                      child has survived, she's grown strong and proud in her own right. You tell them that<br>
                      the 'Traitors Spawn'<br>
                      will one day return to exact her own revenge. Tell them there is a debt owed and I<br>
                      mean to collect.&quot; <br>
<br>
                      Cerawyn's mind was reeling. Finally realization dawned. &quot;You....you were this child<br>
                      that they cast adrift? It<br>
                      was your father they branded a traitor?&quot; <br>
<br>
                      &quot;Aye&quot; was the only word Marina uttered at tears streamed down her face, tears for<br>
                      her lost childhood and<br>
                      tears for the loss of her father. Cerawyn came back to her then, lifting her into his<br>
                      arms he settled himself<br>
                      in the chair with her on his lap. <br>
<br>
                      &quot;This is why you attacked me that first day of training when I mentioned the<br>
                      Scouts?&quot; <br>
<br>
                      Marina nodded. Cerawyn pulled her close and murmered, &quot;I love you, little one, and<br>
                      that has nothing to do<br>
                      with the Scouts.  <p>Luck in the Shadows,<br>

                      against his shoulder. &quot;Come, love. I believe both of us need some rest.&quot; he said as he<br>
                      stood with her still in<br>
                      his arms. Carrying her to the bedroom, he gently lay her down. As he turned to<br>
                      leave, her fingers entwined<br>
                      with his. &quot;Stay with me, please?&quot; she said, her voice soft with coming sleep. <br>
<br>
                      &quot;Aye, love. I'll stay with you for a bit. Perhaps I'll tell you a story. Fair warning, tis<br>
                      not an overly happy tale<br>
                      and it doesn't yet have a ending. But I'll tell you as much as I can.&quot; <br>
<br>
                      Cerawyn sat on the bed, with his back propped against the wall. Cradling Marina in<br>
                      his arms, he began his<br>
                      tale. Her heart swelled as she realized that he was entrusting her with another part<br>
                      of himself. His past. <br>
<br>
                      She was so quiet during the telling that he would have sworn she had fallen asleep.<br>
                      So he was surprised<br>
                      when she sat up, kissing him gently, and he felt the wetness on her face. Wiping<br>
                      away her tears, he pulled<br>
                      her close once again and, exhausted from the emotions of the evening, they slept.  <p>Luck in the Shadows,<br>

                      was safe. As her sleep fogged mind cleared, she remembered the evening before and<br>
                      the stories that she<br>
                      and Cerawyn had shared. Her heart trembled as she remembered his words of love.<br>
                      Propping herself up on<br>
                      one elbow, she gazed down into his sleeping face. This was yet another side of him<br>
                      that she had never<br>
                      seen, totally relaxed and at peace. Although after the story he had told her of his<br>
                      past, she could now<br>
                      understand his inner torment and ruthless nature. <br>
<br>
                      Gently, with one finger, she traced his mouth. His lips, which had the night before<br>
                      given her her first kiss,<br>
                      were slightly parted. Even more gently she bent her head and softly kissed him. He<br>
                      came awake with a<br>
                      start and practically leapt from the bed. Giggling softly at him, she grabbed his hand<br>
                      and pulled him back to<br>
                      her. &quot;Good morning, love&quot;, she said smiling up at him. &quot;Morning&quot;, he mumbled,<br>
                      dragging a hand through his<br>
                      hair and looking very much like a little boy who has been caught at some form of<br>
                      mischief. Marina looked at<br>
                      him questioningly, &quot;What's wrong?&quot; <br>
<br>
                      &quot;We....ummmm.......Did I..........errrr&quot;, he stumbled, and then said in a rush, &quot;We<br>
                      slept together.&quot; <br>
<br>
                      &quot;Aye, we did&quot;, Marina said, &quot;Cer, people have thought that we were lovers for a long<br>
                      time now. I mean we<br>
                      do share this house, and well..........&quot;, she trailed off at the look on his face. It<br>
                      wasn't disbelief or anger as<br>
                      she had expected but almost a look of wonder at something he had not thought of<br>
                      before. <br>
<br>
                      As he pulled her up off the bed and into his arms, she whispered in his ear, &quot;Shall we<br>
                      prove them right?&quot;. <br>
<br>
                      &quot;Only if you'll answer one question for me first, little one.&quot; <br>
<br>
                      Leaning her head back to look into his eyes, she said, &quot;And what question is that?&quot; <br>
<br>
                      &quot;Will you marry me?&quot; <br>
<br>
                      His only answer was her smile as she led him back towards the warmth of her bed. <br>

                      Completely innocent to the<br>
                      dance of men and women, they made up the steps as they listened to the song of<br>
                      love in their hearts.<br>
                      Late in the evening, wrapped in each other's arms, they talked. They spoke more of<br>
                      the past, some of the<br>
                      present , and a great deal of the future. For now there was a wedding to plan. <br>
<br>
                      &quot;Love&quot; Cerawyn began hestitantly, &quot; I know this probably won't sit well with you,<br>
                      but....&quot; <br>
<br>
                      &quot;Go on&quot;, Marina said, running her hand up his chest. <br>
<br>
                      &quot;Well, I was thinking of where we could be married. If it wouldn't cause you too much<br>
                      grief and pain, I'd like<br>
                      to married at the Scouts of Tunare guild in Kelethin.&quot; <br>
<br>
                      &quot;Nay&quot;, she said, &quot;I swore I would never again set foot inside that building and I mean<br>
                      to keep that vow.&quot;<br>
                      Marina lay there thoughtful for a moment before continuing. &quot;But you know, when I<br>
                      was a child one of my<br>
                      favorite places to play was on the platform outside the guildhall. The view of the<br>
                      forest is beautiful and it<br>
                      would allow you to be married where the Scouts could attend and I could keep my<br>
                      vow.&quot; <br>
<br>
                      Cerawyn pulled her up to him and looked into her eyes. &quot;You're certain that would<br>
                      not cause you pain?&quot; <br>
                      Marina nodded and bent to kiss him. Thus the dance began again.  <p>Luck in the Shadows,<br>

Cerawyn had been very secretive about his plans for<br>
                      their wedding, only telling<br>
                      Marina to be in Kelethin on this day. Not being able to find a magical means of travel,<br>
                      she had made the<br>
                      long arduous journey by boat. Unable to contain her excitement of soon being<br>
                      married to the man she<br>
                      loved, she paced the deck of the ship, willing it to move faster. <br>
<br>
                      When the boat finally docked in the Butcherblock Mountains, she begged a passing<br>
                      druid to grant her the<br>
                      speed of the wolf, explaining that she had to be in Kelethin for her wedding. Even<br>
                      with the druid's blessing<br>
                      of the spell the journey took several days to make. <br>
<br>
                      When she finally arrived in Kelethin the morning of the ceremony, she made her way<br>
                      to the bank to retrieve<br>
                      a wedding gift that had been given to her by one of Cerawyn's friends. Cerawyn had<br>
                      always hated her<br>
                      Lockjaw Vest, so she had decided to wear the new Blackened Iron one for the<br>
                      wedding ceremony.<br>
                      Grabbing the tunic, she headed to the small house that had been her childhood<br>
                      home. <br>
<br>
                      Upon entering the house, the first thing she noticed was the air of abandonment<br>
                      about the place. To keep<br>
                      herself occupied, she began cleaning the small house. Sweeping the floors, wiping<br>
                      and polishing tables, the<br>
                      main room and kitchen were soon cleaned. As she moved to cleaning the bedrooms,<br>
                      she decided that she<br>
                      would tell Cerawyn that this was where she wanted to spend their honeymoon.<br>
                      Maybe happy memories<br>
                      here would erase the old sad ones and bring her home more often. <br>
<br>
                      Leaving the house only a few times, for a new mattress for her parents bed, flowers<br>
                      and candles, she soon<br>
                      had the place spotless and looking more homey. Then it was time to get ready. Filling<br>
                      the large copper tub<br>
                      that sat in a corner of her parents room, she bathed quickly. (OOC: Sorry Ferall) <br>
<br>
                      Once she was dressed, the new tunic was much heavier than her old vest but she<br>
                      supposed she would get<br>
                      used to it, she headed up the ramps to the Scouts Guild. There were people<br>
                      everywhere, some old friends,<br>
                      some new ones, and some people she didn't know at all. <br>
<br>
                      As the hour of the ceremony approached, she began to grow worried. It seemed no<br>
                      one had seen or heard<br>
                      from Cerawyn. Even the priestess, who was to perform the ceremony, had not heard<br>
                      from him since he had<br>
                      asked for her to bless their union. The minutes seemed like hours as the time came<br>
                      and passed for the<br>
                      ceremony to begin. Had he changed his mind? <br>
<br>
                      Quietly she made her way around the back of the guild hall, not sure what to say to<br>
                      those out front who<br>
                      were waiting. While she kept saying to herself that he would soon be there, the knot<br>
                      in stomach had her<br>
                      scared. <br>
<br>
                      Suddenly, there were strong arms around her waist pulling her back into a broad<br>
                      chest. &quot;I'm sorry, my love&quot;<br>
                      he whispered in her ear, &quot;I was delayed retrieving these items for you. I had them<br>
                      kept for me in the vault<br>
                      in Highkeep and it took longer than I expected to get them.&quot; He turned her to face<br>
                      him then, took her right<br>
                      hand and slid on a large silver and emerald ring. &quot;This ring belonged to the man who<br>
                      raised and trained me<br>
                      after my parents deaths. The other is my mother's wedding ring but I believe I need<br>
                      to wait a few more<br>
                      minutes before I can put that one on your finger.&quot; <br>
<br>
                      As her eyes filled with tears, he took her hand and led her to the waiting preistess. <p>Luck in the Shadows,<br>

                      Cerawyn more with each<br>
                      passing day. They seemed to be the perfect match. Together they hunted for days<br>
                      on end: orcs in<br>
                      highpass, gnoll reavers in the Eastern Karanas, pickclaws inside the hold. The days<br>
                      were happy and the<br>
                      nights blissful. <br>
<br>
                      So it was a complete surprise when Marina awoke one morning to find Cerawyn gone.<br>
                      His armor and<br>
                      weapons still lay in their places. The only that was not among his things was the ring<br>
                      she had proudly<br>
                      placed upon his finger at the wedding. <br>
<br>
                      Marina couldn't understand where he would have gone without his armor or weapons<br>
                      but convinced herself<br>
                      that he would return shortly. <br>
<br>
                      The days passed slowly but soon dragged into months. Still he had not returned.<br>
                      Others tried to convince<br>
                      her of his death but she would not believe. Surely she would feel his loss if it were<br>
                      true. <br>
<br>
                      While going through his armor yet again, trying to discern some clue as to why he<br>
                      had walked out of her<br>
                      life, she began to feel angry. Why would he just leave without so much as a word to<br>
                      her? With her anger<br>
                      came an idea, the armor was just going to waste sitting here. Gathering up the armor<br>
                      that he had been so<br>
                      proud of, she took it to the local smith. <br>
<br>
                      After the smith had finished the alterations, Marina took the armor back home. There<br>
                      seemed to be no<br>
                      trace of Cerawyn left there. Putting on the refitted armor, she noticed that it fit like<br>
                      a glove and black<br>
                      really did become her. <br>
<br>
                      After that day, Marina would only smile when people would mention Cerawyn's death.<br>
                      But her eyes would<br>
                      sparkle dangerously when his name was mentioned and her methods of killing seemed<br>
                      to change. She took<br>
                      more chances and seemed to kill swiftly without remorse. Soon her guildmates took<br>
                      to calling her the Black<br>
                      Widow, for the men she fought always seemed to die more swiftly than any others. <br>

                      guildhall. Grabbing a robe<br>
                      from the back of the chair next to the bed, she hurriedly tugged the door open to<br>
                      see a messenger<br>
                      standing there. <br>

                      Marina at the title, and<br>
                      handed her a piece of parchment. &quot;Messengers have been sent to find you where<br>

                      &quot;Well then I guess you are the lucky one to have found me, just one moment&quot; turning<br>
                      she rummaged in her<br>
                      small belt pouch and pulled out a few coins, handing them to the messenger. <br>
<br>
                      Closing the door and turning back into the room, she walked to the window and<br>
                      looking out saw the<br>
                      messenger speed away back toward Freeport. Looking up into the sky, she noticed<br>
                      that the sun was just<br>
                      beginning to rise. &quot;Oh well&quot;, she thought, &quot;nothing like an early start to the day&quot;. <br>
<br>
                      Turning her attention to the piece of parchment, she carefully opened it and read<br>
                      the words written there.<br>
                      Then she read it a second time and a third. <br>
<br>
                      My lady Marina Shadowshield, <br>
<br>
                      This is to inform you that your husband, one Cerawyn Shadowshield, has been seen<br>
                      the Greater Faydark<br>
                      area. He has obviously been held in captivity for some time but appears to be in<br>
                      reasonably good health<br>
                      and uninjured. Should you desire to see him, he has been seen hunting in the depth<br>
                      of the Citadel of Clan<br>
                      Crushbone. <br>
<br>
                      Could it really be true? Had Cerawyn been returned to her? She dressed quickly,<br>
                      wondering a bit what<br>
                      Cerawyn would say when he saw what she had done with his armor. Grabbing her<br>
                      packs and throwing in<br>
                      whatever spare equipment she could find, she ran to find a port to anywhere near<br>
                      Greater Faydark.  <p>Luck in the Shadows,<br>

She no longer feared the denizens of the place. Their many<br>
    weaknesses had been known to her for sometime. She didn't even consider the many orcs running around.<br>
    The only thought in her mind was to find out if the message was correct and Cerawyn had returned. <br>
<br>
    After some consideration, she headed towards the slaver caves. She had known for sometime that the<br>
    Scouts of Tunare had a spy inside the home of the orcs. Perhaps if she could find this man, he would know<br>
    if Cerawyn had truly been seen here. <br>
<br>
    As she entered the caves which held the many slaves captured by the Crushbone Orcs, she kept well to<br>
    the shadows. She had no desire at the moment for a fight, she simply wanted some information. Moving<br>
    cautiously deeper into the caves, she heard the sounds of battle. Soon a grieviously wounded orc came<br>
    past, fleeing for his very life. Following close on the heels of the orc was a crudely dressed woodelf. As he<br>
    drove his dagger deep into the back of the fleeing orc, she realized he was a rogue. After he had rifled the<br>
    pocket of the dead orc, he stood and turned so that Marina could see his face. Cerawyn!! <br>
<br>
    As he headed back down the passage to the area worked by the slaves, Marina sat down. She hadn't<br>
    actually thought to find him here. What to do now? He had walked away from her so long ago, left without<br>
    a word. Did she just leave now or did she confront him, demanding an explanation? <br>
<br>
    She sat there for what seemed like hours, pondering the choices before her. Feeling again the pain that his<br>
    leaving had caused her. Several more times, she saw him chasing orc slavers down the passage past her<br>
    but she remained concealed. <br>
<br>
    Finally deciding that if he wished to see her, he knew the places to look, she stood to leave. At just that<br>
    moment, another wounded orc rounded the corner. Just as Marina stepped out of the shadows, she was<br>
    knocked to the ground with a heavy weight on top of her. Looking up, she was face to face with Cerawyn,<br>
    his look of surprise mirroring her own. <br>
<br>
    Leaning down, he kissed her once, pulled back looking into her eyes, and then kissed her again. Standing,<br>
    he helped her to her feet, saying &quot;I never thought I'd be able to do that again.&quot; <br>
<br>
    Marina just stood there, looking at him, unsure of what to feel. Cerawyn took her hand and led her deeper<br>
    into the caves. &quot;I'm waiting for Kelynn to show up. I have to get some information from him for the guild.&quot; <br>
<br>
    Marina started a slow burn. Once again he had put Scout's business ahead of her. If not for the message<br>
    from the unknown person, she still wouldn't know he was here. <br>
<br>
    Sitting down with her back against the wall, she looked at Cerawyn and said simply &quot;Why?&quot; Cerawyn<br>
    sighed. He had hoped to have more time with her before he had to explain where he had gone and why. <br>
<br>
    &quot;You remember me telling of my mother's murder?&quot; <br>
<br>
    Marina nodded her head, looking confused. What did his mother have to do with his leaving? <br>
<br>
    &quot;Living with you, loving you, I saw how happy my parents had been. It began to eat at me that their time<br>
    together had been cut short by the Circle of the Unseen Hands. I decided it was time for me to have my<br>
    revenge. I traveled to Qeynos and managed to get into the guildhall or so I thought. It was a trap. The<br>
    guild leader is a paranoid devil but this time it paid off for him. I was captured and thrown into a cell. I was<br>
    kept in that cell until about a month ago when I managed to escape.&quot; <br>
<br>
    &quot;But why didn't you tell me?&quot; <br>
<br>
    &quot;You wouldn't have let me go alone. If I hadn't taken you with me, you would have followed me. I couldn't<br>
    allow you to be harmed. That is why I didn't come straight to you when I escaped. If they had decided to<br>
    come after me, I couldn't risk you.&quot; <br>
<br>
    Cerawyn knelt next to Marina, running his fingertips over her features. &quot;You are my heart, I won't ever<br>
    allow anyone to harm you.&quot; <br>
<br>
    Tears rolled down Marina's face, &quot;I thought you had left me.&quot; <br>
<br>
    &quot;Never, my little one. It was thoughts of you that kept me going, that kept me seeking a way out. Will you<br>
    forgive me for leaving?&quot; <br>
<br>
    &quot;Do you promise to never do anything so stupid as that again?&quot; Cerawyn nodded. Marina reached up and<br>
    pulled his face down to hers. &quot;Then aye, I forgive you. But if you ever do anything like that again, I'll kill<br>
    you myself&quot; she whispered. <br>
<br>
    Cerawyn chuckled and then leaned in to kiss his wife.  <p>Luck in the Shadows,<br>
