     Lying there, on my back in the snug interior of that shabby little tent that I called home, I let my mind wander back over the past year. Wow, had it been a year since I first found myself whisked away to this strange world? Since that time I had assumed many rolls; lone adventurer, willing student, loyal vassal, close friend and worldly monarch. &lt;Sigh&gt;, time really was catching up with this old Crow. Even sleeping in relative luxury in this small tent now more often than not found me awaking with sore bones and chilled muscles. But was it really age…or the discomfort of wearing a mantle that no longer fit that was bothering me? All my young friends who had followed my path into this danger-infested place were now able to take care of themselves…some even better at fighting prowess than myself. Was it right to be King when others were more lordly? Was it right to command others when they could provide for themselves better than you could? No. And now, after flexing my monarchy muscles for the first time ever, one of our own was wandering this world alone. Being a bowman, I’ve always felt more comfortable out in the open, camped by a fire in the wilds. This ruling of others was something that never set well with me. The nomadic lifestyle was my calling…a calling I was good at…yet the one who was missing from the family would find hard by herself. &lt;Sigh&gt;, What a mess. Looking into the corner of the tent I noticed my packs were all bundles together, my personal effects from around the tent safely stored inside. My newest bow strapped in the place of the old…but still within easy access while hiking the wilds. Several quivers of plain Armor piercing arrows bristled from several spots within the pile. Nothing fancy…yet with my ever-increasing skills these plain arrows would be most deadly to most of the denizens of this world. Walking over to my belongings, I quickly donned my hunting gear of choice. Light yet sturdy; the perfect wardrobe for my journey ahead. Yes, it was time for me to go. Rummaging in my packs, I quickly found supplies to pen a quick note. Ghar’adin would not be happy, but he was now Lord and Protector of the family. My tent, now his. My explanation was short and to the point. I had failed as a monarch and would salvage what little honor remained. I would leave. Gathering my packs I made my way outside to the fire that perpetually burned in my camp…my camp no longer. I was surprised to see the old, toothless vendor already up yet it was hours before the dawn would even begin to paint the skies. Quickly flipping a small sack of baubles his way brought a grin to his old, craggy face. We had played this game nearly every morning for a year now … but somehow we both knew this would be the last time. Seating myself before the fire, he brought me a small bowl of his customary stew. During our time together in this camp he had tried to feed me everything from Drudge and Shreth to the occasional Swamp gromnie. Where he got his meat I never new. Taking a quick whiff, I was surprised by the pleasant aroma wafting up from the bubbling contents. @#%$ing my head to the side and fixing him with a piercing eye, I asked the same old question: “What is it this time?” His reply, as always, “A bit o this and a bit o that.” Taking a quick spoonful, I was amazed at the wonderful taste that seemed to dance cross my palate. A blend of chili peppers, oregano, salts and several unknown condiments with just a hint of … was that chocolate? “What do you call this?” I asked in amazement. The small chunks of meat within the fiery sauce were more tender that any I had consumed before. Steeling myself for his answer I could only begin to guess … shadow meat, lich meat …maybe banderling? “It is called Texas Chili.” He responded. “What is a Texas?” I asked. I don’t ever remember killing one of those before. Maybe a new creature from the dires? “It is a recipe from a far off land usually fed to a breed of men who spend their lives on the road…drifting from one place to another.” “Somehow, it seemed like a fitting dish for you Crow.” Crow, he never called me by my name. Looking up, I managed to catch a glimpse of wet eyes before I quickly looked away. “It is made from the meat of … an Arwic cow.” I began to laugh! After an entire year and I finally get beef! Quickly cleaning my bowl, I stood and shouldered my pack. Turning to the vendor I smiled and threw out my regular parting statement. “See ya around old man.” “Bring back any interesting things you might stumble across young pup.” He replied. Yet, somehow … we both knew that we would probably never see each other again. Turning to the east, I began a slow jog off into the darkness. The gloom and distance quickly masking the tears that flowed freely from two sets of eyes. To the road once again.<br>
