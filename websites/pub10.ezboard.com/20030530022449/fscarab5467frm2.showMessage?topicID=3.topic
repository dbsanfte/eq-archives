<br>
It outlines rules in general, pertaining to all different subjects.<br>
It also outlines only new things, all of the old will still be used.<br>
<br>
1) You will now undergo a initial period which will be known as the &quot;proving period&quot; in order to join SCARAB. There is no set period of time for this but inactive initiates will be removed from the list eventually and have to re-apply.<br>
<br>
--a)During this time you are REQUIRED to attend at MINIMUM 2 OFFICIAL SCARAB fights/raids and show interest in SCARAB.<br>
--b)Not attending 2 scheduled events will result in you having to reapply all over again once you have been removed from the initiate list.  Exceptions DO APPLY! If this situation arises it will be taken care of in some fair and just fashion, on an individual basis.<br>
<br>
2) During the &quot;proving period&quot; you are not a member of SCARAB, but instead are known as an &quot;initiate&quot;.<br>
<br>
3) Initiates will gain points per our points system.  Initiates start with 0 points, but it is possible (quite possible, actually) to have a good amount of positive points before initiate period is over.  Your points accumulated as an initiate will carry over with you when you become a member.<br>
<br>
4) Raiding and/or helping on epic/quest fights will gain you points.  Points will be awarded per our points system (see post below).<br>
<br>
5) You are not allowed to claim money.  No money ever collected for raids will be used by anyone personally, it will be a cash fund to replace costs of reagents, ports (planes, for example), and anything else the group needs.  The SCARAB fund will be made public(look in the Scarab bank forum), and will be updated along with the members list at minimum once a week.  All purchases (down to the last copper piece) will be documented when made with the SCARAB fund.<br>
<br>
6) If an item is dropped on a raid, and all the attending members of SCARAB have insufficient points to be able to claim it or do not want to spend items through the &quot;auction system&quot;, the item will go to the SCARAB bank. Items in the SCARAB bank will be opened for auction to all SCARAB members.<br>
<br>
7) There will be either a mainlooter at each raid or the groupleaders will be instructed to loot by the raidleader, if anyone is caught looting other then the main looter/group leaders, he/she will be banned for a minimum of 1 week from all SCARAB raids.  Repeat offenses of this will ban that person from SCARAB raids completely.  Suffice to say, if you ninja an item, you will never ninja an item again from us.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Any arguing whatsoever or fighting about loot will disqualify the parties involved from all points for that raid, it will also disqualify them from all prize claiming from that raid (they will not be able to cash in points in order to roll for an item gained).  Repeat offenses will ban you from SCARAB events for 1 week. Repeat offenses after being banned will ban you from SCARAB.  Suffice to say, if you care about nothing except shiny metal objects and ph4t l3wt, you do not belong in SCARAB.  Theres the door, hurry up because im going to hit you with it on the way out...<br>
<br>
9) Rules added to this list will be added and given a full week of scrutiny by all members before being 'officially' added.  That, of course, relies 100% on the majority vote of the members on the new rule.  SCARAB will perform everything it does in a completely fair, equal opportunity, &quot;republic&quot; sort of way.  Every member, from the leaders to the lowest lvl members without any points all have an equal say in the development of SCARAB.  Votes will be held regularly for ANY and ALL changes made to the structure of SCARAB.  To make it easy, they will be put in poll form, and only registered members of SCARAB will, of course, be allowed to vote.  At the end of the poll period, the decision of the group will be executed. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bscarab5467.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sildmuffinhands>Sild Muffinhands</A> at: 1/8/03 7:20:04 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/umoriminomoto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mori Minomoto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(9/1/02 11:37:54 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Loot rules, ctd.</span><hr size=1> Main looting rules:<br>
<br>
1) Each raid will have an ML (main looter) or the raid leader will instruct group leaders to loot.  Only the ML, and if assigned, a backup ML or the group leaders will be allowed to loot.  This includes all coin, research components, everything.  It is a good idea for raid leaders to assign both an ML and a backup ML.<br>
<br>
2) Initiates MAY NOT loot.  They MAY accumulate points to be cashed in at later raids for loot.  Initiates caught looting, or even attempting to cash in points for loot, will be banned from SCARAB.  Mistakes are understandable, and if made, must be corrected immediately when discovered. (ie: if a raid leader doesnit know that an initiate is only an initiate, and goes ahead and gives him/her a won item.  In this kind of scenario, immediately after the initiate is contacted by one of the SCARAB leaders, he/she must return the item, and explain the situation.  If he/she fails to do so, it is considered ninja-looting and is an immediate ban from all SCARAB events, ever.)<br>
<br>
3) All money gained on raids will be added to the SCARAB bank.  All research components will be dealt out to those thats wants it at the raid(of course those that needs first), if no one wants it, it will be destroyed<br>
<br>
4) All loot will be dealt out at the END of each raid.  There will be an end-raid meet point for all SCARAB members which will be designated before the raid (and is in fact quite feasable to just be the pre-raid meet point).  In the scenario that the intended raid is more then a single zone raid (ie: double dragon raid - naggy and voxx), all loot will be dealt out AT THE END of the raid, that is to say, when the entire raid is finished (in this scenario: both dragons are dead, or the raid leader calls it an end).  In the situation of a multi zone raid, when one zone is finished and the raid party is ready to move to the next zone, the ML (main looter) or group leaders will give all unique dropped items to the RL (raid leader) and all scrub items (research stuff, money, misc junk) to the backup ML.<br>
<br>
5) NO DROP items must obviously be looted by their appropriate owner immediately.  When a ND (no drop) item is encountered, only the SCARAB members present with sufficient points will be allowed to bid on it (and cash in points for it).  <br>
<br>
6) Cashing in points and rolling for items is only allowable for items that your class can use.  Realistically reasonable judgement is implied.  SCARAB will work primarily as a NBG (need before greed) group.  A few examples: (a)Rangers are not allowed to roll on secondary slot shields (Lodi Shield, however, as an example, is ranger winable due to it also being backslot wearable)...(b)Obvious monk items (lightweight, monk usable, good stats) cannot be rolled on by warriors, paladins, and shadowknights (plate classes), but under most circumstances, will still be chain class winable (rangers/rogues)...(c)Rogues get the daggers, paladins/SKs have first choice on 2 handers, rangers/warriors/rogues have first choice on 1 handers.<br>
<br>
7)  An add-on to rule #7.  When you, lets say, as a wizard, are doing a quest that required an item that, lets say, a warrior would use, then you are still allowed to roll on the item as if you were a warrior.  PROVIDING that you, before the raid, and on the raid thread in our forums, explain the quest you are doing, explain the loot needed for the quest, and provide links to any websites that can support your claim.  (&quot;I need RBB for my wizard epic&quot; is not going to cut it...you must prove somehow that you in fact need the item that is droppable in the zone(s) we are raiding for your quest.)  If you do not research before-hand to find out what items are dropped in the zone(s) we are raiding, and/or if you need any of those items for quests, and if you do, do not let the raid know about it in the raid thread here, you will not be allowed to win that/those items if they drop, end of story. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bscarab5467.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sildmuffinhands>Sild Muffinhands</A> at: 1/8/03 7:46:10 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bscarab5467.showUserPublicProfile?gid=karoluseq>KarolusEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Little Quellious' Seer</span><br>  Posts: 236<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(11/30/02 11:00:12 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Loot rules, revised.</span><hr size=1> Here is our revised point system as of 29/11/02<br>
<br>
<br>
-------AUCTIONING SYSTEM-------<br>
<br>
I. DEFINITIONS<br>
RAID: Any cooperative grouping on a given zone/quest hit/etc. that constitutes of at minimum 10 players.<br>
RP: Raid Point.  This is the 'currency' of which loot can be 'purchased' with in SCARAB.<br>
RL: Raid Leader<br>
GL: Group Leader (assistants to RL)<br>
ML: Master Looter<br>
<br>
A. Point Rewarding<br>
<br>
Points are awarded on each raid based on a few criteria:<br>
<br>
I. You get 1 RP per 2 hours of any 'official' raid.  Rounded up.  Abuses of this merely to farm RPs will result in no RPs awarded.  Gains from a raid will be expected to live up to the RPs awarded.<br>
<br>
II. If you arrange a raid (i.e. you are the raid leader) you receive one extra point.<br>
<br>
III. You get half the standard RPs for a given raid if you:<br>
--Come late<br>
--Leave early<br>
--Cause disturbance<br>
--Disobey RL and/or raid plans<br>
--Are caught AFKing too often and/or are not participating and doing your job<br>
It is ultimately up to the RL who is rewarded half, and if there are any extreme cases, who is awarded no points at all for a raid.  When someone is denied any points for a raid, the GLs and/or backup RLs etc will have to come to an agreement on this so as to not allow any given RL to abuse this 'responsibility'.<br>
<br>
IV. On single-hit quest mobs (eg. EK druid/ranger fight, monk fists, etc) all present will be awarded 1 RP.<br>
<br>
V. Points are awarded at the END of any raid/event.  Points awarded for any such raid/event cannot be used, thus, during said raid/event (because you wont actually have them yet).<br>
<br>
VI. If you behave inappropiate in a scarab raid, you will receive a warning, if you have received two warnings in the same raid you will lose a point, if you receive three or more warnings, you may be asked to leave raid.<br>
<br>
<br>
B. Auctioning (General)<br>
<br>
I. Loot will be bid for in increements of two points, if a member have below two points and is the only wishing a piece of loot, the member will be allowed to loot, but will receive no points for the raid. A member with less then 2 points may not bid on an item, but only give tell that she/he is interested.<br>
<br>
II. Bidding for loot is CAWU (Can And Will Use) you are not allowed to bid for items just to twink an alt or sell it for money in the first round. If no Chars on the raid want the item, it is open for bidding to alts/sell/whatever.<br>
<br>
III. With the coming of Planes of Power, it is now possible to turn in old Hate and Fear armor for a minute XP reward and a gem. Therefor in future Hate / Fear raids all armor that no one can't or won't use will be auctioned to members for the minimum of 1 point (exception to above rules). <br>
<br>
IV. NO DROP items will be taking care of as soon as possible, while dropable items will be looted by whoever is lootresponsible at the raid. When there is a break in the raid, or at the raid end, the loot will be distributed as discussed above. Dropable loot that no one wants goes to the SCARAB bank to be sold for cash to fund SCARAB raids or to be auctioned among the members.<br>
All cash loot and vendor sold items goes to the lootresponsible after a raid.<br>
<br>
V. Invited persons to a scarab raid will only be allowed to loot something if no present SCARAB members/initiates can't or won't use it. On a rare occasion an outsider will be invited because we could not do a raid without that person (or class). In that case she may be allowed to roll on a choosen item with others on raid that wants the item.<br>
<br>
VI. All expenses for a SCARAB raid will be refunded to the person who have expenses. (Peridots, Pearls, Gatestones, Coffins). Raid Leader is responsible for keeping score of eventual debt to a SCARAB member.<br>
<br>
(VII. If a raid is hosted as an open raid/invited raid, regular rules dont apply , instead all drops is randomed between whoever is interested or the raiding guilds rules are used. <br>
If 40% of the raid force is members of SCARAB (and not members of the guild hosting the raid) points will be awarded after SCARAB rules.) &lt;--- currently under discussion.<br>
<br>
VIII. The raid leader can &quot;change&quot; or &quot;not follow&quot; all the rules, if he got the support of a big majority of the raid force. However permanent changes must be discussed on the SCARAB board.<br>
<br>
C. Auctioning (Details)<br>
<br>
I. When an item is dropped, the ML or RL will link/shout out the item(s) in the raid channel (after all fighting is over and a 'loot up, rest up' pause is given or at the end of the raid).  Anyone who wishes, according to NBG, to claim the item will send the ML a tell with but two bits of info:<br>
/tell MasterLooter I want item X, I bid Y RPs.<br>
<br>
II. Once the ML announces an item, members that have sufficient points and are allowed to claim an item according to the rules in section B, can send tells with their bids to the ML. Bidding will be done by increments of two (exceptions see section B)<br>
<br>
III. Items may only be bid for by those with POSITIVE RPs from PREVIOUS raids. You will be required to know beforehand how many points you have on a raid. You cannot drop below 0 when bidding for points.<br>
<br>
IV. Dishonesty in reporting your true point value to the ML will result in decisive 'disciplinary' action taken against your membership in SCARAB.  Mistakes are allowable, lying is not.<br>
<br>
V. If two members bid the same amount of RPs, they get another chance to raise their bid. Highest wins. If those who draw on a bid do not want to increase their bids, the item will be randomed between them. <br>
<br>
VI. Unclaimed items go to the SCARAB bank/funds. <br>
<br>
VII. Multiple items MAY be looted by the same person on a single raid, but in EACH loot claiming situation, the raider must meet ALL of the requirements associated with item looting.<br>
<br>
VIII. There will be no reserved looting.  THE exception to this rule is on quest mobs/quest hits that are organized for the intention of claiming a loot item for a given player.<br>
<br>
<br>
D. NO DROP Looting<br>
<br>
I. An item that is ND will be claimed as per the standard looting rules.<br>
<br>
II. In the situation that an ND item is not claimed by anyone, everyone present will have the option of claiming the item at the expense of gaining no RPs for the current raid.  Any further items looted in this way will be 'free' in the sense that the claiming player will still gain no RPs for the current raid. <br>
<br>
Any multiple claims of an item for the 'cost' of gaining no RPs for the current raid will be resolved by the ML using /random.<br>
<br>
III. If an ND item is still unclaimed, it will be considered to be looted for MQ and goes to the SCARAB bank.<br>
<br>
IV. Drops like Planar Armor will be looted by the ML to be turned in for SCARAB funds. (if none else on raid wants it)<br>
<br>
V. If none of the above applies, the item in question is FFA.<br>
<br>
<br>
E. Recruiting: SCARAB Mercenary Aid<br>
<br>
To recruit SCARAB's for quest mobs, help with quest hunting, or whatever else you have in mind, you must meet a few criteria:<br>
<br>
I. You must have positive points<br>
<br>
II. For every 3 SCARAB members recruited, you will &quot;spend&quot; 1 RP, rounded up per two hours.  Thus, a full group (not including yourself) would cost you 2 RP for 2 hours. 4 RP for 4 hours and so on.<br>
<br>
III. When recruiting for a certain task, any loot gained is at your sole discretion to be reserved.<br>
<br>
IV. Looting reserved items follows the same looting rules as per regular items.<br>
<br>
V. If 2 (or more) people present wish to do the same mob hit for their own quest advancement, then EACH person (including the first) must have a minimum of RP equal to the recruitment cost divided by the number of players wishing to get their quest loot.  This means that, for example, if there were 2 druids and a ranger present for the EK epic fight, and all 3 wanted to get that part done, they would split the points cost by equally , but would also all be required to have enough RPs to get their portion.  In the case that 2 full groups are recruited for 3 ppl: 12-3=9/3=3/3=1...its 12 ppl total, minus the 3 that are getting the loot, divided by 1 RP per 3 ppl recruited, divided by the 3 ppl getting loot (2 druids and a ranger). Thus, each of these players would need(and spend) 1 RP to partake in this.  RPs in this situation are awarded according to the standard 1pt=2hours guideline (rounded up).  Thus said, it will be wise for players to do the same mob hits together, so they can share the cost of points. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bscarab5467.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sildmuffinhands>Sild Muffinhands</A> at: 3/28/03 8:39:35 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/fscarab5467frm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=3.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/fscarab5467frm2.showNextMessage?topicID=3.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fscarab5467frm2.emailToFriend?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fscarab5467frm2.threadControl?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fscarab5467frm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fscarab5467frm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub10.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="scarab5467frm1">General Discussion<option value="scarab5467frm2">Rules, Guidelines, etc.<option value="scarab5467frm3">Applications for Membership<option value="scarab5467frm4">Raid Announcements<option value="scarab5467frm5">Public Tactics<option value="scarab5467frm19">Private Discussion<option value="scarab5467frm6">Quest/Epic Raids, Fights, etc.<option value="scarab5467frm7">Zone Raids<option value="scarab5467frm8">Raid Aftershock<option value="scarab5467frm9">Epic Progress<option value="scarab5467frm10">Screenshots<option value="scarab5467frm11">Raid Suggestions<option value="scarab5467frm12">Raid Tactics & Strategies<option value="scarab5467frm13">Current Members & Points<option value="scarab5467frm17">SCARAB Bank<option value="scarab5467frm14">Processed Applications<option value="scarab5467frm18">Board Administration</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6F6F6F>- </font><a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/bscarab5467>SCARAB</a><font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><a href=http://pub10.ezboard.com/fscarab5467frm2>Rules, Guidelines, etc.</a> <font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/bscarab5467">SCARAB</a><font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
