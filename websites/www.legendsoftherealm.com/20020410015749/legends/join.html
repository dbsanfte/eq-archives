hope you are here because you have had some positive contact with some members
of&nbsp;Legends of the Realm and you liked our play style.&nbsp;We do not actively seek to
recruit new members; we&nbsp;would rather have prospective members seek us out.&nbsp;If
you have not met or know any of the members of&nbsp;Legends, I encourage you to venture
out and try to meet some before seeking membership.&nbsp;All you need to do is type
&quot;/w all legend&quot; and you will get a good idea who is on and where they are in the
world.</font></p>

  change your vote to a Yes/No since once voted you cannot &quot;revote&quot;
