These 2 words set the standard for the Legends of the Realm's Code of Conduct. If you keep these two words in your heart, you will go far. Our reputation as a courteous guild should be the top priority, regardless of how we are treated in return.<p>

This Code is a guideline on which to base member actions and reactions. It in no way dictates how any member should play their character, only the individual can make that decision. <p>
<ol>
<li>EVERYTHING you do, is reflected upon your brothers and sisters in the guild. 
<li>Be considerate to everyone around you, guildmates and non-guildmates alike. 
<li>Death and experience loss is part of the game. Don't let it adversely effect you and the ones around you. 
<li>Do not get involved in excess shouting or arguments. If you have a disagreement, take it to /tell. 
<li>Do not intentionally train. Trains happen, understand that someone may not be doing it intentionally. 
<li>Do not steal another's kill. 
<li>Give everyone the benefit of the doubt, and use diplomacy and tact in every situation. If need be, walk away. 
<li>Take time out of your adventuring to help others, guild and non-guild. 
<li>If someone is harassing you, use the /petition command. 
<li>Have fun! <p>
</ol>
Specific Examples:<P>

   <i>Kill Stealing</i> -- is not condoned. Ask first if you have time. If the person is in obvious trouble, begin helping but back off if they indicate they do not require assistance.<br>
<i>Training</i>--It does not matter how rude the other person was to you or what action they took upon you, Training creatures specifically on another is not acceptable. There are invariably innocent bystanders who get killed and harmed by these Trains.<br>
<i>Camping</i>--Should you decide to camp a spot and another group arrives, be courteous and attempt to work out some sort of rotation Worst case scenario, pick up and move to a new location. <p>
