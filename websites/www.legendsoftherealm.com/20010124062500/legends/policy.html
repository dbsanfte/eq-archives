<b>I. General</b><p>
<ol type=A>
<li>Legends is blessed with kind, decent, giving people. While this policy may be ahead of itself, in an effort to keep the problems associated with good loot from affecting us, we are issuing this policy.
<li>Any loot received at a guild event is yours; it is not on loan to you from the guild. While the guild will never ask you to give up one thing to get another, giving items no longer used to members who will use them is always encouraged. 
<li>Events subject to this policy are those that: 
<ol><li>Are announced on this message board at least 3 days prior to the event; 
<li>Have a designated leader in charge of the event, organizing it and keeping track of who attends; 
<li>Have at least 10 Legends members committed to attend; and 
<li>Have pre-determined Criteria that must be met for point award; and 
<li>Are approved and recognized by a guild officer. (this doesn't mean said officer has to be present, just that an officer is aware of the event. Purpose is for the officer to ensure items 1-4 are taken care of). 
</ol>
<li>If the event does not fall into C above, then loot determinations are the responsibility of the Raid Leader 
<li>Plane Raids will NOT be Point Award Events. 
</ol>

<b>II. Non-Planar Loot Policy</b><p><ol type=A>

<li>This policy and the items obtained here under are completely separate from the Planar Loot Policy and items obtained under that policy. 
<li>Guild members receive one point for each guild event attended (Points are awarded at the conclusion of an event). 
<li>If an event coordinator deems it necessary for a player to play a specific character to ensure a successful raid, then said player may determine to which of his characters the points will be awarded. This decision is final, and must be made at the time the points are awarded. 
<li>Points may be spent on items obtained by the guild at an event the person is participating in. 
<li>Item Distribution Items will be distributed in the following order:<p><ol type=a>
<li><b>Persons whose class/race is listed as able to use the item:</b> 1. Person who does not have the item--with highest point total 2. Person who does not have the item, no points 3. Person who does have the item--with highest points 4. Person who does have the item, with no points will compete as someone who can not use the item 
<li><b>Persons who's race/class can NOT use the item:</b> 1. Person who does not have the item--with highest point total 2. Person who does not have the item--with no points, who have not received anything at the event 3. Person who does have the item, with no points, who have not received anything at the event 4. Persons with no points who have received something at the event 
<li><b>Miscellaneous:</b> If no one in any of the above categories wished the item, then it now becomes a Free For All item. Anyone may now /random 1 70 and have the chance to obtain the item at the cost of 0 points. The person with the highest point total in category (A1) has the first choice of the item. If that person chooses not to take the item, the choice is passed to the person with the next highest point total, etc. Any ties within any category will be resolved with a /random of 1 70. <p>
If no one in (A1) wishes to spend points, then the decision moves down to category (A2) and then category (A3) and then to (B1-4) and finally to category C. Once an item reaches category C, no points are to be "charged" if you win the item. <i>EXCEPTIONS: There are certain items useable by all but much more useful to some rather than others. Two prime examples of these are Efreeti Boots and the Flowing Black Silk Sash. With the boots, all casters (including Clerics, Druids and Shaman) get preference, and with the sash all hybrids and melee get preference. Other items may be subject to exception on a case by case basis, as determined by the event leader.</i><p></ol>

<li>With respect to no-drop items, only those people who can use will bid or random for those items. 
<li>If you decide to take an item, you lose all your points unless you obtain it under category C. 
<li>A guild member must be participating in the event to use points on, or random for an item.
</ol>

<b>III. Planar Loot Policy</b><p><ol type=A>
<li>Each class to determine the way in which it will deal with planar armor loot. The class policy must be approved by the Guild Leader. The only requirements are that the policy be fair, equitable and consistent. 
<li>A very few planar items are droppable: specifically both the Shaman and Cleric belts. Any item of this sort will be distributed by the guild to its members in those classes first, including members who are not on the raid (the preference going to those on the raid). Once each member of that class in the guild has one, the remainder of these items will be distributed according to the non-planar loot policy. 
<li>Drops from Cazic-Thule, Innoruuk, the Maestro, and the Dracholich will be dealt with under the non-planar loot policy. 
</ol><p>

<b>IV. Non-guildmembers</b><p><ol type=A>
<li>When Legends is sponsoring an event and we have non-guild members along with us. We do a /random with the person. Not a normal /random though. What we are randoming is a chance for the non-guild member to obtain the item. He/she will be rolling against all other guildmembers at the event who could use the item. If he wins the /random, he gets the item. If a guildmember wins the /random, then the item is looted as per our guild system. In other words, just because I rolled the highest number and won that random, it doesn't mean I will get the item. We will refer to our system to see who gets it. Basically, you won the right for our Loot System to win. 
<li>If a non-guildmember arrives at the event over halfway through the event, they may still roll, but at a 25% penalty to their /random (i.e. using 1 70 is used, everyone else involved in the /random will add +17 to their roll--having everyone else add to the roll negates the problems with the person obtaining a net of a 0 or less roll). 
</ol><p>
<b>V. Unofficial or ad-hoc Events</b><p>
Legends members are highly encouraged to follow the Loot Preference List under II. E above at all times. No points will be spent at an unofficial or ad-hoc event. If a dispute among Legends Members over loot ever arises, the Preference List will be the arbitrating factor over who is allowed to random.<p>
