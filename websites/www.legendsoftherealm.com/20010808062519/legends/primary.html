        </b>I have removed some pictures from the real life pictures page.&nbsp;
        I was saddened to see someone make a reference to how someone looked and
        they even had the audacity to post a link to the picture.&nbsp; I will
        not abide by such behavior and have removed several pictures.&nbsp; If a
        member wishes a picture to remain, they need to email me stating they do
        not mind the picture remaining up.</font>

        </b>Legends of the Realm is currently </font><b><u><font face="arial" size="-1" color="#FF0000">not
        accepting any new membership applications.</font></u></b><font face="arial" size="-1" color="#ffffff">&nbsp;
        We have recently grown fairly large recently and need to take time to
        get to know the newer members before accepting any others into our
        guild.&nbsp; If you are interested in joining Legends, the best advice I
        can provide is to simply group with as many Legends members as often as
        you are able.&nbsp; This will greatly expedite the process should we
        once again begin accepting new members.&nbsp; If you are not currently
        aligned with the Claws of Veeshan faction, that is something else you
        should consider working on before attempting to join Legends.&nbsp; We
        are Pro-Dragon aligned and actively hunting in areas where it is
        imperative you be at least dubious to CoV faction.</font>

        A great time was had by Rosha, Azlaan, Philander, Aylith, Vestrial,
        Thorkin, Yorke, and Veera.&nbsp; Yup, we called each other by our games
        names the entire time too :P hehe.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I had some
        technical difficulties with my camera so I was unable to snap all the
        pictures I wanted.&nbsp; We did get a group photo while we were at the
        Tournament of Kings Dinner Show.&nbsp; Phil has that and we should be
        able to have it scanned and posted at some point (provided all pictured
        consent).</font></p>
