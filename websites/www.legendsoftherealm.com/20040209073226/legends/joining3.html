Legends of the Realm</font></h1>
</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Thank you for your interest in Legends of the Realm. We
are a very old guild on the Innoruuk server and I encourage you to click on the
History link to the left and read a bit about our guild. We have long-standing
traditions as a guild and high expectations of all our members.<br>
<br>
The application process can be lengthy and will require commitment and
dedication on your part. You may be given a temporary guild invite to facilitate
the process. This does not mean you are a Full Member of the guild, it just
means you get to read our guild chat. While wearing our guild tag, you are
expected to behave as a Legend and to follow the directions of guild officers.
If you are found to act in a dishonorable fashion you will be removed and not
allowed to reapply.<br>
<br>

    <h2><font color="#FFFF00"><br>
    <br>
    How the process will work:</font></h2>
    <p><font color="#FFFF00">Once you have posted your intent to join, you need
    to attend raids so we can find out if you’re right for the guild. After
    you have attended several raids, the officers will decide whether or not you
    shall continue with the application process and become an official prospect.
    There is no set duration for this process. We may decide someone doesn’t
    mesh with the guild after a couple raids, or they are exactly what we are
    looking for. In general, your availability will determine the speed with
    which you get through this step. If you raid every day, it will probably
    only take a couple weeks. If you’re on only once a week, it may take a
    couple months.<br>
    </font>
    <ul style="color: #FFFF00">
      <li>
    <p><font color="#FFFF00">Applicants should NOT expect to attend any Mith Marr
        (although, if you can zone into HoHb w/o needing a Raid to get you in,
        then you may join) or Rallos Zek flaggings (key is &quot;expect&quot;,
        not that you will never be allowed to attend).</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#FFFF00">
    If you pass the first step and become an official prospect you will be
    granted conditional membership into the guild. When the officer's determine
    you have been attending enough raids that the guild membership has had time
    to evaluate your potential as a Legend, a poll will be put up and our
    members will decide whether or not you become a full member. It behooves you
    to be as available as possible the weeks following your conditional
    guildinvite. Don’t accept the tag the day before you go on vacation for
    two weeks…<br>
    <br>
    Conditional Membership means--You are now a Prospect<br>
    </font>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#FFFF00">You wear the guild tag and are expected to
        uphold the traditions and code of Legends. Your behavior is a direct
        reflection upon the guild.<br>
        </font>
      <li><font color="#FFFF00">You are requested to participate in as many
        raids as possible. When not raiding, grouping with other Legends members
        is highly encouraged.<br>
        </font>
      <li><font color="#FFFF00">You will not be granted access to the private
        sections of the Message Boards.<br>
        </font>
      <li><font color="#FFFF00">You should not expect any loot that drops on a
        raid unless it will decay.<br>
        </font>
      <li><font color="#FFFF00">You should not request guild assistance to
        complete any quests that require more than a single group.<br>
        </font>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

    <font color="#FFFF00">
    Full Membership.<br>
    A poll will be put up for you when the officers think the guild has had
    enough time to evaluate your potential. At that time, the general membership
    will vote on your acceptance as a full member. When accepted, access to all
    forums will be granted and your name will be added to loot lists and you
    will be eligible for all flagging raids.<br>
    <br>
    If you do not pass the membership vote, you may reapply no earlier than 3
    months.<br>
