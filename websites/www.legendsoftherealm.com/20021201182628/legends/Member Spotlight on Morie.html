<p>Morie...the player of many faces!&nbsp; She has so many characters that it is
hard to keep track of who is who!&nbsp; I first met Morie when she was playing
her first character on Innoruuk.&nbsp; It was a bard named Songweaver.&nbsp; We
had some great adventures together...right up until the point I convinced her
(and some others) that we could handle RunnyEye.&nbsp; You must remember, this
was when EQ was new and the highest level players were level 12!&nbsp; Anyway,
she (well, Songweaver was a he) died in a very inaccessible spot for our
group.&nbsp; Thus ended the short life span of that bard.&nbsp; She then started
a Human Monk (at the time, only Humans could be Monks--there was no Kunark) who
went by the name of Luikang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Morie has played almost every class (that I know about).&nbsp; Let me see if
I can name some of her many characters of a significant level (I know I am going
to miss a few and mispell some names)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Songweaver--Bard</li>
  <li>Luikang--Monk</li>
  <li>Morigaine--Enchanter</li>
  <li>Morie--Druid</li>
  <li>Morissa--Bard</li>
  <li>Morisan--Rogue</li>
  <li>Nazcas--Shaman</li>
  <li>??--Iksar Monk</li>
  <li>Morlyssa--Enchanter (I think)</li>
</ul>
<p>Morie has been with Legends from the very beginning.&nbsp; There was a short
stint where she left for another guild along with some other of the
higher-levels.&nbsp; But, she returned soon thereafter and has remained a very
active and productive member of the guild. </p>
<p>Why did I put her in the Spotlight?&nbsp; Because Morie does so much for the
members of this guild.&nbsp; She will help players camp items and most
importantly, helps other players earn experience.&nbsp; She frequently sets up
camps for players with the sole purpose of earning as much experience as
possible.&nbsp; Morie is always ready to help another guildmember and always
ready to help the guild on a raid. </p>
