Legends of the Realm</font></h1>
</font>
<p align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000" face="arial" size="5">Legends is not
accepting new applications at this time.</font></b></p>

<font face="arial" size="-1">
<p><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica" size="6" color="#FFFF00">W</font><font face="arial" size="-1"><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica" color="#FFFF00">elcome!&nbsp;I
hope you are here because you have had some positive contact with some members
of&nbsp;Legends of the Realm and you liked our play style.&nbsp;We do not
actively seek to recruit new members; we&nbsp;would rather have prospective
members seek us out.&nbsp;If you have not met or know any of the members of&nbsp;Legends,
I encourage you to venture out and try to meet some before seeking membership.&nbsp;All
you need to do is type &quot;/w all legend&quot; and you will get a good idea
who is on and where they are in the world.</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica" color="#FFFF00">Joining Legends
of the Realm isn’t that hard, however we want to know you well before you
enter our&nbsp;ranks.&nbsp;There are a few steps that are involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<h2></font><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica" color="#ff9900" size="-1"><b>Requirements</b></font></h2>
<font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica" color="#FFFF00" size="-1">
<ul>
  <li><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica" color="#FFFF00" size="-1">First
    and foremost ... you need to get to know members of this guild.&nbsp; Group
    with as many as you can as often as you can.&nbsp; If you are the type of
    player that would fit into the guild, I am confident that members will seek
    you out to join on raids and regular experience groups.</font></li><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica" color="#FFFF00" size="-1">
  <li><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica" color="#FFFF00" size="-1">We
    do have a minimum level requirement.&nbsp; You need to be at least level 58
    with one character before seeking entry into the guild.</font></li>
  <li>We no longer require a single person to sponsor you for membership, but
    you need to let it be known you seek membership.</li>
  <li>You must have all the EverQuest Expansions (Kunark, Velious, and Luclin).&nbsp;
    Legends hunts all over Norrath.</li>
  <li>Legends is a Claws of Veeshan Faction guild (Dragon aligned).&nbsp; You
    must <b><u>NOT</u></b> be KOS to COV faction. Ideally, you will be Ally with
    that faction (or able to reach ally via spell/song).</li>
</ul>
<h2><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica" color="#ff9900" size="-1">How
does the process work?</font></h2>
  The process for becoming a member of Legends has been greatly shortened. If
  you are accepted as a prospect, you will be offered an invitation to wear the
  Legends guild tag immediately.<br>
  <br>
  Conditional Membership means--
  <ul>
    <li>You wear the guild tag and are expected to uphold the traditions and
      code of Legends. Your behaviour is a direct reflection upon the guild.
    <li>You are requested to participate in as many raids as possible. When not
      raiding, grouping with other Legends members is highly encouraged.</li>
    <li>You will not be granted access to the private sections of the Message
      Boards, but you will be granted access to the Events section.</li>
    <li>You should not expect any loot that drops on a raid unless it will
      decay.</li>
    <li>You should not request guild assistance to complete any quests that
      require more than a single group.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Full Membership.<br>
  After at least 2-weeks of wearing the Legends tag, a poll will be put up for
  you. At that time, the general membership will vote on your acceptance as a
  full member. When accepted, access to all forums will be granted and your name
  will be added to loot lists.<br>
  </p>
  </font></font>
<h2><b><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica" color="#ff9900" size="-1">What
happens if I don't get the required number of votes for admittance? </font></b></h2>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color="#FFFF00">Your
poll will be removed.&nbsp; You may apply again after a minimum of one
month.&nbsp; The process will then be restarted.&nbsp; Two weeks to be
accepted once the poll is put up by the guild officers.</font></p>
