        </font></b><font color="#FFFFFF">A wild and crazy night! The night 
        started off with Lodizal spawning while we were gathering for a 8th 
        shawl war. Grats Asdrubael on map piece and I don't know who else got 
        what but I think boots and some shells dropped. Then we went and 
        finished Senadaen's 8th shawl. HUGE grats to sen on finishing that 
        hellish quest. Grats DH on your bopping club and Aylith on your neck 
        piece. Thats 8th shawl #2 for Legends. Then we heard that ToV went down 
        earlier and that Telk and Gozzrem were up. Well we quickly moved over to 
        ToV and slayed those two veil beasts. Grats Infirit on a emerald 
        bastard(hah suits me perfectly) sword of purity and Shagium on Pauldrons 
        from Telk, and then Wand for Phudge and Unopenable box of stones for 
        Lokaris. Not stopping there we headed to Katta and got a real shot at 
        the retuned Lcea. The fight was long and interesting. I would like to 
        say grats Twit for making us all laugh, well except maybe Stonesmasher. 
        Grats Andy on uber belt and the main freak himself Almo on a whopping 
        stick.</font><p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

first trip to Veeshan's Peak, a force of 30 Legends and 4 guests took out 5 of 
the 6 dragons of the zone. Unfortunately Hoshkar wasn't up and for now has 
escaped our wrath. After many months of slaving over our keys, the rewards were 
definately reaped in. Excellent pulling by Barrett, Vestrial, and Agthanor 
allowed us to put all the dragons to sleep in about 9 hours. Congratulations all 
who attended!</font><!--webbot bot="PhotoAlbum" U-Include="photogallery/photo17837/real.htm" clientside TAG="BODY" startspan -->

  <font face="arial" size="-1" color="#ffffff"><b>Aug 2nd Picture Page<br>
        </b>I have removed some pictures from the real life pictures page.&nbsp;
  I was saddened to
        see someone make a reference to how someone looked and they even had the audacity to post
        a link to the picture.&nbsp; I will not abide by such behavior and have removed several
        pictures.&nbsp; If a member wishes a picture to remain, they need to email me stating they
        do not mind the picture remaining up.</font>
  </p>
        <p><font face="arial" size="-1" color="#ffffff">That being said, a new picture has been
        put up of that little halfling rogue we know as Lumpin.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial" size="-1" color="#ffffff"><b>July 31st&nbsp; Membership Information!<br>
        </b>Legends of the Realm is currently </font><b><u><font face="arial" size="-1"
        color="#FF0000">not accepting any new membership applications.</font></u></b><font
        face="arial" size="-1" color="#ffffff">&nbsp; We have recently grown fairly large recently
        and need to take time to get to know the newer members before accepting any others into
        our guild.&nbsp; If you are interested in joining Legends, the best advice I can provide
        is to simply group with as many Legends members as often as you are able.&nbsp;
        This will
        greatly expedite the process should we once again begin accepting new members.&nbsp;
        If
        you are not currently aligned with the Claws of Veeshan faction, that is something else
        you should consider working on before attempting to join Legends.&nbsp; We are Pro-Dragon
        aligned and actively hunting in areas where it is imperative you be at least dubious to
        CoV faction.</font> </p>

        <b>July 13-15 2001 Las Vegas Gathering a Success!<br>
        </b>Several of us met in real life in Las Vegas over this weekend.&nbsp;
        A great time was
        had by Rosha, Azlaan, Philander, Aylith, Vestrial, Thorkin, Yorke, and Veera.&nbsp;
        Yup,
        we called each other by our games names the entire time too :P hehe.&nbsp;
        Unfortunately,
        I had some technical difficulties with my camera so I was unable to snap all the pictures
        I wanted.&nbsp; We did get a group photo while we were at the Tournament of Kings Dinner
        Show.&nbsp; Phil has that and we should be able to have it scanned and posted at some
        point (provided all pictured consent).</font></p>
        <font face="arial" size="-1" color="#ffffff"><p>Real-Life Gathering update.&nbsp;
        Please
        make your own reservations with <a href="http://www.excaliburcasino.com" target="_blank">The
        Excalibur Hotel and Casino</a>.&nbsp; I will still see if we can get the rooms in the same
        area and work on getting a meeting room for the evening of July 13th.&nbsp;
        I am also
        checking on group seating for the Tournament of Kings Dinner show for the evening of July
        14th.</p>
        <p><b>May 29th 2001<br>

        the first group photo of Legends!!&nbsp; Screenshots from the first ever Legends in-game
