    on Leadership and running a guild<br>

    </font><font color="#FFFFCC">These are my thoughts and opinions on how to
    lead and run a guild. I have been involved with leading guilds since before
    Ultima Online. I first started out on MPlayer with a MechWarrior 2
    &quot;Clan&quot; and League. I helped establish the league and was involved
    with the running of a MW2 Clan. I started playing UO sometime in 1997 and
    was first involved with helping to run a guild and then later, the actual
    leader of a guild on another server (the original Legends of the Realm). I
    established LotR in EQ and lead the guild from it's creation in May of 1999
    until October of 2001. These are just my reflections and thoughts on the
    matter, this is not a &quot;How-to&quot; or a &quot;Must follow&quot; guide.
    What worked for me may not work for others.
  <ul>
    <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><u><font color="#FFFF00">A Guild is NOT a
      democracy</font></u><br>
      </span>That was
    always my number one thought. A guild cannot be run by the masses of the
    guild. There needs to be one and only one person with ultimate authority and
    responsibility. This does not mean a leader ignores the inputs and
    suggestions from the guild. It simply means when there are choices and
    decisions to be made, you know who is the final authority. If a conflict
    with another guild arises, you have one person that is ultimately
    responsible.<br></li>
     <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><u><font color="#FFFF00">A Leader surrounds himself with competent
      people</font></u></span><br>
      I never claimed to know every aspect of the game and I never
    conducted a large-scale raid. I would rather concentrate on other areas and
    maintain a view on the entire guild than get bogged down with the nuances of
    running a raid. I carried the same thought when it came to loot decisions.
    My feelings in this area were to remain as impartial and objective as
    possible by allowing the officers to develop the loot lists and loot order.
    That way if a question ever arose, I was not already partial to a list
    because I had developed the list. I was able to make a decision based on all
    the relevant factors.<br></li>

     <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><u><font color="#FFFF00">A Leader
      listens<br>
      </font></u></span>By that I refer to
    a couple of things. I would just listen (read) to discussions or arguments
    between the officers and/or members. Allowing them to discuss the issue
    freely without any chance of my opinion adding a bias helped me to
    understand all the sides to an issue before making a decision. It is very
    important to try to get to the heart of an issue without letting any emotion
    about the issue, or people involved, cloud a decision. However, a leader
    needs to know when to intervene. If the discussion turns from a productive
    one to a flame war, then it is time to step in and take action.<br></li>

     <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><u><font color="#FFFF00">A Leader communicates with the
      guild<br>
      </font>
      </u> </span>The
    guild needs to know the leader is out there and that he/she actually listens
    to what the members are saying. This is probably one of the most difficult
    tasks. Listening to the guild doesn’t mean the leader does everything an
    individual member asks. There are many times when it is near impossible to
    implement every suggestion offered by a member. However, the leader needs to
    communicate with the member and guild to let them know they were heard and
    perhaps explain why that idea is not being acted upon immediately. Providing
    feedback is not easy, but ignoring the guild will cause bigger problems
    later on.<br></li>

     <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><u><font color="#FFFF00">A Leader establishes
      direction<br>
      </font></u></span>This
    one is one of the most visible things a leader can do. People like to have a
    purpose and they like to know why they are asked to do things. Providing
    goals, objectives, and direction is a means of communicating the purpose for
    being in the guild. This is an on-going process. As the guild evolves so
    must the guild’s direction. As goals are met, new ones need to be set and
    communicated to the membership. This gives people a sense of accomplishment
    as you meet goals and set new ones. They have a purpose for playing and for
    being a productive member of the guild. The guild goals or direction should
    be communicated to the guild on a regular basis. You can deviate from the
    plan for a while, but if you stay off the plan for too long the focus of the
    guild begins to blur. It is ok to change the goals and direction of the
    guild. Change is good and shows that people are in charge and paying
    attention to what is going on around them. However, don’t make a change
    simply for the sake of change. There needs to be a purpose behind the change
    otherwise it will fall flat.<br></li>

     <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><u><font color="#FFFF00">A Leader is
      compassionate</font></u><font color="#FFFF00"><br>
      </font> 
     </span>We are all
    human. That means we all have feelings and our own goals within the game.
    The concept of a guild is to merge individual goals with a group, thereby
    accomplishing bigger and better personal goals. A Leader must never forget
    that his/her guild is a conglomeration of individuals. Try not to make
    decisions when emotional. If you are angry or upset with a member, it is
    best to wait a while before taking any action or making any decisions
    regarding that member. Take the time to understand their position.<br></li>

     <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><u><font color="#FFFF00">A Leader moderates he does not
      instigate</font></u><font color="#FFFF00"><br>
      </font> </span>A
    Leader should not do things to add to heated arguments or flame wars between
    members. A Leader should moderate such things while maintaining a neutral
    stance if possible. If the leader must choose a side, he needs to do so
    objectively and without attacking the opposing side. A good rule of thumb is
    to attack the idea, not the person.<br></li>

     <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><u><font color="#FFFF00">A Leader is firm and
      decisive</font></u><font color="#FFFF00"><br>
      </font> 
     </span>When a
    decision is made, the leader needs to communicate it unequivocally. The
    guild needs to know the leader's position and that the decision has been
    made.</li>
  &nbsp;
     <li><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"></span> 

    </font>

    <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><u><font color="#FFFF00">A Leader supports</font></u></span> <font color="#FFFFCC"> <br>
 A leader should
    support his guild and the members of his guild. This is not to say the
    leader will support a very bad action of a member, but if the member was in
    the right or doing nothing wrong, the leader should support and defend that
    member.</li>
