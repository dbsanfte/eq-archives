</font>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica" size="6" color="#FFFF00">W</font><font face="arial" size="-1"><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica" color="#FFFF00">elcome!&nbsp;I
hope you are here because you have had some positive contact with some members
of&nbsp;Legends of the Realm and you liked our play style.&nbsp;We do not
actively seek to recruit new members; we&nbsp;would rather have prospective
members seek us out.&nbsp;If you have not met or know any of the members of&nbsp;Legends,
I encourage you to venture out and try to meet some before seeking membership.&nbsp;All
you need to do is type &quot;/w all legend&quot; and you will get a good idea
who is on and where they are in the world.</font></p>
<p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica" color="#FFFF00">Joining Legends
of the Realm isn’t that hard, however we want to know you well before you
enter our&nbsp;ranks.&nbsp;There are a few steps that are involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<h2></font><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica" color="#ff9900" size="-1"><b>Requirements</b></font></h2>
<p><font color="#FFFF00"><span class="postbody">
<font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Legends is  currently not accepting applicants 
of the following classes: </p>
<blockquote>
  Druid <br>
Enchanter <br>
Rogue <br>
Shaman <br>
Shadowknight <br>
Warrior </font>
</blockquote>
</span></font>
<font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica" color="#FFFF00" size="-1">
<ul>
  <li>First
    and foremost ... you need to get to know members of this guild.&nbsp; Group
    with as many as you can as often as you can.&nbsp; If you are the type of
    player that would fit into the guild, I am confident that members will seek
    you out to join on raids and regular experience groups.</li><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica" color="#FFFF00" size="-1">
  <li><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica" color="#FFFF00" size="-1">We
    do have a minimum level requirement.&nbsp; You need to be at least level 63 with one character before seeking entry into the guild.&nbsp; </font>
  <span class="postbody">&nbsp;<font size="2">If this seems too distant a goal 
  for you and you feel like you don’t want to wait that long, this likely isn’t 
  the guild for you. Patience is a prime attribute for any successful prospect. 
  Legends’ progress is slow and steady, often measured in geologic time.
  <img alt="icon_wink.gif" src="photogallery/icon_wink.gif" border="0" width="15" height="15"> 
  Likewise, if seeing end-game content, or getting some uber item
  <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">now</span> is a priority to you, Legends wont 
  be a good fit. We will see it all, eventually, but we’re in no particular 
  hurry. </font></span></li>
  <li>We no longer require a single person to sponsor you for membership, but
    you need to let it be known you seek membership.</li>
  <li>You must have all the EverQuest Expansions (Kunark, Velious, Luclin, and
    Planes of Power).&nbsp;
    Legends hunts all over Norrath.</li>
</ul>
<h2><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica" color="#ff9900" size="-1">How
does the process work?</font></h2>
  <blockquote>
    <span class="postbody"><font size="2">Once you have posted your intent to 
    join, you need to attend raids so we can find out if you’re right for the 
    guild. After you have attended several raids, the officers will decide 
    whether or not you shall continue with the application process and become an 
    official prospect. This will be accomplished by an informal poll of our 
    members. There is no set duration for this process. We may decide someone 
    doesn’t mesh with the guild after a couple raids, or they are exactly what 
    we are looking for. In general, your availability will determine the speed 
    with which you get through this step. If you raid every day, it will 
    probably only take a couple weeks. If you’re on only once a week, it may 
    take a couple months. <br>
    <br>
    If you pass the first step and become an official prospect you will be 
    granted conditional membership into the guild. After no less than two weeks 
    a poll will be put up and our members will decide whether or not you become 
    a full member. It behooves you to be as available as possible the weeks 
    following your conditional guildinvite. Don’t accept the tag the day before 
    you go on vacation for two weeks… </font><br>
    </span><br>
  <br>
  Conditional Membership means--
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>You wear the guild tag and are expected to uphold the traditions and
      code of Legends. Your behavior is a direct reflection upon the guild.
    <li>You are requested to participate in as many raids as possible. When not
      raiding, grouping with other Legends members is highly encouraged.</li>
    <li>You will not be granted access to the private sections of the Message 
    Boards.</li>
    <li>You should not expect any loot that drops on a raid unless it will
      decay.</li>
    <li>You should not request guild assistance to complete any quests that
      require more than a single group.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Full Membership.<br>
  After at least 2-weeks of wearing the Legends tag, a poll will be put up for
  you. At that time, the general membership will vote on your acceptance as a
  full member. When accepted, access to all forums will be granted and your name
  will be added to loot lists.<br>
  </p>
  </font></font>
<h2><b><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica" color="#ff9900" size="-1">What
happens if I don't get the required number of votes for admittance? </font></b></h2>

<p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color="#FFFF00">Your
poll will be removed.&nbsp; You may apply again after a minimum of one
month.&nbsp; The process will then be restarted.&nbsp; Two weeks to be
accepted once the poll is put up by the guild officers.</font></p>
