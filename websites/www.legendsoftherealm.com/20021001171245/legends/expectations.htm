<h1 align="center"><font color="#FFFF00">Expectations of Guild Members<br>
by Rosha Cristi</font></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">As a former guild leader and a guild
officer, I am going to give my opinion on what I expected from a guild member.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>These are only my opinions and I cannot speak for the current guild
leader or other officers.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I just wish to share my thoughts on the matter.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;</font><b><font color="#FFFF00">First
and foremost…<u>I expected everyone to have fun.</u></font></b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><b><font color="#FFFF00">
</font></b><font color="#FFFFFF"> </font></span><font color="#FFFFFF">EverQuest
is a game (granted, it is more than “just” a game, but it is a game
nonetheless).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If you are NOT having fun, then you should log off!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If you continue not having fun, you should probably stop playing, as this
is obviously not a game for you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise,
if the guild is somehow making the game not fun, I expected to be notified.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Give me the chance to make it fun for you again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nothing irritated me more than to see people leave and be told there was
something not right with the guild.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
something was causing you problems or distress, I expected to be informed!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You need to be as specific as possible because a blanket statement like
“<i>there are problems in the guild</i>” does not do me any good at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>That is like saying “<i>we are having a party in Chicago…come join us</i>”
and leaving it at that.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Chicago is one big city so finding your party is going to be
rather difficult!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;</font><font color="#FFFF00"><b>I
believe a guild member should dedicate at the very least, 75% of his/her time to
furthering the goals of the guild.</b></font><font color="#FFFFFF"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The other 25% can be spent doing whatever (I consider hunting for
experience to be furthering guild goals by the way—levels are power).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When a guild event or raid is planned, I expected available members to
lend their support.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When some spur
of the moment raid pops up, I expect members to support the raid and do their
utmost to make the raid happen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
expected members to group with each other before choosing outsiders with whom to
group.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFF00"><b>&nbsp;I expected members to put
the good of the guild ahead of their own personal gain.</b></font><font color="#FFFFFF"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In a sense, making the guild stronger is making you stronger.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>So what if you didn’t get item X…as long as someone else
in the guild got item X, then it just increased your chances of the guild being
able to obtain many more item X’s.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;</font><font color="#FFFF00"><b>I
expected members to respect each other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></b></font><font color="#FFFFFF">Think
about what your gaming experience means to you and then transfer those feelings
to your guild mate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Do not do
things to your guild mate that you would not like to have happen to you!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Do your best to answer questions your guild mates ask.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Everyone hates being ignored and the more people there are in a guild,
the worse it feels asking some question and then being ignored.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;</font><font color="#FFFF00"><b>I
expected members to act professionally.</b></font><font color="#FFFFFF"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They should know how to play their class and play it to the utmost of
their abilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don’t care if
you have a personal disagreement with player X…you do your job and they will
do their job and the entire guild reaps the benefit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The last things the guild needs are members who refuse to attend events
or join groups with some other member.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That
WEAKENS the guild and that person should probably examine their expectations of
what they want from a guild.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;</font><b><font color="#FFFF00">I
expected members to respect the decisions put forth by the guild leadership.</font></b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><b><font color="#FFFF00">
</font></b><font color="#FFFFFF"> </font></span><font color="#FFFFFF">This does
not mean everyone must agree with the decisions or that they cannot voice their
opinions about the decisions…by respect, I mean they realize the leadership is
trying hard to make fair and objective decisions to further the guild as a
whole.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you disagree with a
decision, please explain why in a rational manner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Keep in mind, there may be things factored in the decision that YOU are
unaware of at the time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise,
by explaining in a rational manner, perhaps you will bring something to light
that the leadership did not know about at the time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;</font><font color="#FFFF00"><b>I
expected members to realize the guild leader and the guild officers are players
as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></b></font><font color="#FFFFFF">We
are also human beings…meaning we are not perfect!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is no pay for being the guild leader or an officer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is certainly no glory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
only gratification is knowing you are helping others accomplish things in the
game that would be impossible to accomplish alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I have turned down loot or asked to be placed lower on a priority list in
an effort to avoid any perception of favoritism or elitism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I know many other officers who also do the same.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You practically have to force them to accept an item.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<hr>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;<font size="6">W</font>ow, that
looks like a lot of expectations for just being in a guild!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></font><font color="#FFFF00">Why would anyone want to be in an
organization that expects so much from him or her?</font><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"><font color="#FFFF00"> </font><font color="#FFFFFF"> </font></span><font color="#FFFFFF">It
is simple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The power to see areas of the game that one could not see alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The power to obtain items that are impossible to obtain solo (or even
with a small group).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
camaraderie of being in an organization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;</font><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;
mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"><font color="#FFFF00"><b>A Guild should give 100% back
to its members.</b></font><font color="#FFFFFF"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Everything a guild does should be to further the progress of its members
in some form or fashion.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>A guild should be responsive to its membership and be willing
to adapt, as the membership needs change.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></span></p>
