	      <I> "Arturiss me old friend! Tis good to see ya. Have a seat me friend and
	      let&#146;s get to work." Exclaimed Brombeard as he shook Arturiss&#146; hand.
	      "What is this you want of me? Some sort o history?"</I>
	      <P ALIGN=Left>
	      <I> "Yes my short friend. I have been collecting histories of my companions
	      so that their tales will last til the dragons return." Arturiss stated while
	      pulling a seat to the table in the crowded pub.</I></TD>

	<I> Brombeard reached into his sack and pulled out a beaten old box. The
	scent of ale spilt forth as if he had just opened a fresh bottle. Pulling
	two musty bottles from the box, Brombeard gnarled the tops off with his teeth,
	setting one in front of each of them. "Where shall I begin? Tis an odd tale,
	but a good one at that." Brombeard said after a long drought from the bottle.
	"From what me pops told me, I just showed up one day. He had been out huntin
	fer ingredient fer his new ale when he found me crawlin around. I guess I
	had thought that I could scale one o the Butcherblocks that day. He said
	I was half way up the mount when he saw me." Brombeard chuckled when he
	remembered the day his father had told him. "From the beginin I was awnry,
	or so I have been told. Stickin me nose into places it nae belonged. I remembered
	days in my youth where I was getting into fights all the time. Finally, me
	pops decided that nuff be nuff and sent me to the warriors academy. This
	is where all me life training was shown to me.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> "Several months o trainin ensued. Finally, the guild master told me to
	go out on me own to further me trainin. Me thinks it was due to the beatins
	I was giving the other students. This is where I met me best friends Hustrun
	and Tobbin. They took me to places that I thought I would ne&#146;er go to.
	Places I have only heard of from stories that me pops told me. Places such
	as Unrest and Crushbone, those be the trainin ground fer ol&#146; Brom."
	Brombeard paused for a moment to take a long pull from his ale. Looking up
	he noticed that half of his friends brew had been finished and a slightly
	glazed look in Arturiss&#146; eye. He began to chuckle.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> "Ah. Then there was me first time o&#146;er to Antonica. This is where
	I met Lady Trespare. And where I got me favorite axe!" He exclaimed holding
	his tomahawk. Arturiss noticed that Brom had a distant look in his eye. Reading
	his lips, Arturiss could swear Brom said Rianna. Brombeard took another swig
	before beginning again. " After the Pass at HighHold, I found me self all
	over. Oasis to Qeynos, I was transportin people all over the world. It was
	good fer me to see the entire world. Finally, I got me fill of portin people
	around and took up me axe fer me own reasons. This is where we end. There
	are some stories in there, but let those be fer another time. Now be the
	time to drink me brew. May Brell bless ye on all your journeys." Toasted
	Brombeard as he quickly finished his ale.</I>
