<I>{Continued from Going Home}</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Zsalshun stared at the sleeping enchanter on her floor. She had not expected
him to take her up on her offer, rather she had couched her lines to wound
his young ego and raise his ire. He was supposed to have left in a fit of
wounded pride, not be camping out on her floor. She was thoroughly unprepared
for this new turn of events. She laughed softly.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>::Moma?:: Amber wiggled the question in the dim light of the room.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>::It seems we have a house guest small one.::</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Amber looked uncertainly from the cleric to the prone enchanter. ::Is
he going to help us??:: The small face lit up with the possibilities of making
a new friend.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>::Careful, Amber. Remember that we can't afford to trust anyone. We will
let him stay for a while but I want you to stay clear of him. Understand?::</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Amber nodded her head but her eyes remained puzzled. ::Why?::</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Zsalshun sighed. How did she explain all of what had happened to a child?
Especially a child prone to seeing good in just about anyone. ::People are
not what they seem. Until we know more of this man, I don't want you and
he alone. Ever. OK? Now scoot along, take the book and this other to the
hiding place. Come back when you are done.::</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Amber scooted along the passageways until she came to the door that lead
to the forgotten back alley. Her mother had warned her that this was the
most dangerous part of the journey and the little enchanter dutifully put
the books down and drew the illusion of the Tier' Dal around her. She gathered
her tomes back up and looked both ways before crossing the short open
space.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She reached the other side without incident and opened the hidden latch
that allowed a section of wall to slide back. She set the books back down
and pushed with all of her strength. The wall moved slowly and just enough
for her to squeeze inside. She wiggled into the dark and checked the small
sliver of wood near the door. Her mother did this every time they came to
the hiding place so the small enchanter frowned and stared at the bit of
wood. It looked like a bit of wood. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>That done, she snaked an arm out to retrieve the tomes and set about to
close the door. </I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The priestess watched as Amber slipped away into the darkness. This was
no home for the little high elf who&#146;s very skin marked her as a target
to be hated and killed. Qeynos was a friendlier town to the young enchanter
but it put her within the hungry claws of the guild. Zsalshun would not see
her daughter sacrificed as Trespare had been. The Tier &#145;Dal was running
out of options and the addition of the younger Silverwand only served to
remind her that there were few places she could hide.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She glanced briefly down at the sleeping caster at her feet, then back
around the dusty forgotten room of the Fish. The mute shelves offered no
suggestions to her dilemma and the mouldering books were just as silent.
The priestess shook her head and sat down at the desk. The House was looking
for an answer to the Winterborne malady and riddled among the ancient texts
of the secret room were clues that would help. Unfortunately, Zsalshun could
not even begin to imagine where she might find them. It would take a lot
of work and a lot of time, but if she was diligent perhaps she could throw
the yolk of the guild off and be free of them. Perhaps.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>But what to do with Amber in the meantime? The young Silverwand was right
about the dark elven city. It waited, patiently, for the young enchantress
to slip knowing that the longer she stayed within its walls the more chance
it would have to claim her. Moving back to Qeynos was also not an option.
Her mind ran through several different possibilities and discarded them just
as fast. It wasn&#146;t until her eyes lighted on the dark impression the
old tome had made in the dust that the last idea settled in her mind. She
picked up a discarded thread from the blanket that had wrapped the old book
and let out a quiet sigh. The wrapping had been Amber&#146;s swaddling clothes
and had born the same forest green markings that her birth mother&#146;s
cloak had. It could have been a family sigil.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The caster on her floor stirred and startled Zsalshun out of her musings.
She dropped the thread and grabbed a sheet of parchment and a quill. Hastily
she scribbled a note and folded the paper even as the ink dried. Pocketing
the note and roughly nudging the caster back into the waking world with the
tip of her boot she grabbed a bag and headed towards the door.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;Wake up, Silverwand. We have work to do and lots of it.&#148;</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Zsalshun strode into the city, scarcely waiting for the young caster to
follow her. She needed to find a particular rogue she knew from her child
hood. Not that Tier &#145;Dal rogues could be trusted any further than one
would trust a rabid half mad dog, but this particular rogue owed her life
several time over to the blessings of the Priestess&#146; dark god. That
and the coin and belongings of the burnt wizard would appeal to the money
hungry side of the rogue. Zsalshun could almost guarantee the rogue&#146;s
honesty and trustworthiness with what the wizard had left her.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>After an hour of searching, the priestess found the rogue loitering about
the burnished coin. She was dressed in mostly black with a pair of wicked
daggers sheathed at her hips. Zsalshun nodded in greeting.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;I have come to collect on your debts.&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The rogue glanced at the priestess disdainfully. &#147;I owe you nothing,
Heretic. Be gone.&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;Since it was I who saved you from meeting our dark lord one on one,
I would think you owe me everything you have gained since then. I am willing
to call it even for this one small favor, plus an added bonus if everything
works out.&#148; The priestess tossed the bag at the rogue. The woman deftly
caught it and after a careful examination, opened the bag. Her eyes widened
just a bit as she fingered the soft black robe and her mouth curved into
a predatory smile.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;And I never see you again after this?&#148; The rogues fingers stroked
the satiny fabric of the flowing black robe possessively. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Zsalshun nodded and took out the folded parchment. &#147;Deliver this
and I will include these rings and bracelet as well.&#148; The priestess
held up a pair of glittering rings and a single bracelet. The thief considered
the deal and then shrugged. The bag with the robe disappeared among her
belongings and she reached for the note. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;Sound easy, I&#146;m suspicious of course. The price may go up if
I run into any difficulty.&#148; She read the note, gave Zsalshun a puzzled
look then shrugged. &#147;Your money.&#148; The rogue pocketed the parchment
and slunk off into the city. </I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Loures padded softly out of the city and into the forest night. She had
thought about taking the priestess&#146; black robe and disappearing but
the withheld rings and bracelet were more than a match for her sense of greed.
Her practiced eye had noted their finer craftsmanship in the fleeting instant
they had been presented and something more. An irregularity in the gleam
off of the bracelet that could have been an engraving or some other sort
of personalized mark. True, it could well be the jeweler&#146;s craft mark
but not one that she recognized. The black robe too was an interesting find
in that it came complete with a small hole mid chest. The truth of the matter
was that the rogue&#146;s curiosity was piqued. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>So, just to see where the story ended and what part her ex-guildmate had
played in it had her slipping through the shadows of the forest to deliver
a note to a dwarf in Freeport. Of course she had read the note beforehand,
even the part in ugly unintelligible scratching which had later turned out
to be dwarvish. She was fortunate that the leatherfoot that haunted the commons
had some knowledge of the language but even after he had translated it, the
note remained fairly boring. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin-</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>As you may have heard, I have left the Winterborne house with Amber. I
had planned on disappearing, however Keldore&#146;s young son is a fairly
good sneak and he has found us both. I fear Amber is in danger and there
is only one option for her safety that I can think of, and I need your help.
If you are willing, meet me in the valley between the Commonlands and the
Dark Elf Forest tomorrow evening.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>As for my constant shadow, I have some thoughts about how to deal with
him. I don&#146;t want him killed but I think I can manage to have him
incapacitated for a while on the morrow. If not, I am sure you can persuade
him to stop poking his nose in my business with that sour dwarven demeanor
and large axe of yours. The woman carrying this note will be in Freeport
looking for you by the forge, although with all those scars I am sure she
should have no trouble delivering this note to you. Take care, Balkin.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>~Zsalshun</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Obviously, the second paragraph was meant as instruction to the dark skinned
rogue, how ever childishly it was phrased in Tier&#146;Dal. Loures sighed
as she tried to think of ways to detain the young Dark Elf male that hung
about the cleric without harming him permanently. It would be so much easier
to have the young man killed outright and that way she would also gain a
profit from selling his belongings to the greedy young elves adventuring
in the forest. Unfortunately, the contract was to keep him alive. More work,
less money, she was definitely going to have to up the fee for her
services.</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The rouge slipped into Freeport unnoticed and slunk to the area by the
forge. She did not have long to wait before a rugged armored dwarf hefting
a huge battle axe strode in from the wilds. He threw several packs onto the
floor, grunted and proceeded to get down to business. The axe, resting ever
near, was replaced with a smithing hammer as the dwarf began the rhythmical
beat of his trade. The glow of the furnace outlined the myriad of purple
scars that snaked across his hands, up his arms and body to disappear under
the thick apron he wore for protection. The thief raised her eyebrows; this
had to be the dwarf in question.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Facing his back and still part of the shadows, she called out to him in
a low voice.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;Balkin, I presume? I have a message from the priestess Zsalshun
for you.&#148; She was confident in her skills to stay hidden, but giving
away the element of surprise made her nervous. This warrior could probably
heft his axe and cleave her in two before she could reach any real safety
so she was not about to just fling her trust wildly to the winds and walk
up to him.</I>

<I>&#147;Here are the rest of the hides, Balkin. Whew! It&#146;s warm in
here!&#148; Oblivious to the stranger lurking in the shadows, the wood elf
dragged two full backpacks of hides into the forge, stood, and wiped her
brow. &#147;If it&#146;s safe, I think I&#146;ll go do some site-seeing while
you work. Unless you needed my help?&#148;</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin strode up to the forge at Grolath's and dumped his overloaded backpacks
on the ground there. Several hundred weight of ore, metal sheets, and molds
contained within. T'was a good thing he could make the special larger packs,
or he would have nae been able to get it all to the forge in a single trip.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Quickly, he got down to business. Lady Trespare's husband, the noble Paladin
Amabala had asked Balkin to forge a suit of Fine Steel plate to replace the
ancient and heavy bronze suit he currently wore. Balkin would nae have refused,
even if he had wanted to. Amabala, and his guild were fine allies to house
Winterborne. It was an honor to be able to assist him in his fight for
good.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>It was not long, before he was putting the finishing touches on a highly
burnished silvery Breastplate. He had decided to put some work into customizing
it a little. He did not do this for just anyone. Only his guild, or their
friends. Just as he finished it, and set it aside, two things happend. Fera
came into the forge, dragging 2 packs of hides to use for padding for his
armor. And a quiet voice spoke to him from the shadows behind him. "Balkin,
I presume? I have a message from the priestess Zsalshun for you."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Oblivious to the presence in the shadows, Fera marched right up to the
Dwarves side, still talking. His lighting fast spin caught her attention
though, as did his left hand thumping into her chest, pushing her forcefully
behind him, and his right hand bringing his axe up to a split position. Easily
ready to defend or attack, all at once.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Fera stammered, as she stumbled, and nearly tripped over the huge packs
Balkin had lugged into the forge. She knew she could not have carried one
of them, let alone the whole pile. "What!? What's the matter?"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Taking a step forward, Balkin swung his axe in a swishing motion in front
of him, as he peered into the shadows. "Hush girl, stay behind me." Looking
hard, he could not make out anything but shadow, but the hairs standing up
on his neck and arms told him someone was there. He had not imagined the
low femanine voice.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He stood there a moment, sniffing the air, and peering into the shadows
as hard as he could. He could FEEL someone there, but he could nae see anything.
Brow beetling down, he started to get angry. He tightened his grip on the
haft of his axe, and barely noticed, as his knuckles popped in ones and two's.
Advancing towards the shadowed area, he began swishing his double bladed
axe back and forth at the height of his chest. "Ye better show yerself, if
me axe finds you first, ye'll be all the worse for it."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Loures smiled at the dwarf as he sniffed the air like some sort of blood
hound looking for a scent. With all that armor and stink of swill she wondered
how he could smell anything but himself let alone a dark elf. She chuckled
inwardly at his pathetic attempts at discovering her; she was born and bred
to the shadows and no ale sotted hill monger could ever hope to find her
in her element.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The chuckle died as Balkin picked up his axe and started purposefully
slashing into the shadows. He did not need to pinpoint her location, the
advancing slash of the axe would eventually find her hiding spot if she did
not do something quickly about it. Loures glared at the dwarf from her shadowed
niche. She had hoped to stay and taunt him for a while before delivering
the note but his methodical, if base, approach to discovering her hiding
spot left little time for the basic civilities. Yes, Zsalshun's price was
going up with every step of this adventure.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The dark elf took one last calculating look at the slashing blade and
decided it was time to go. Carefully she inched her way deeper into the gloom,
pausing frequently to see if she had been discovered. Not ten feet behind
her was a doorway and then under the streets and into the sewers. It was
an agonizingly long ten feet creeping along the wall and for most of the
way she remained undetected. She did not turn to see what had alerted the
dwarf to her presence, but her keen ears heard his slight intake of breath
and the shift in his step from searching to catching. Loures bolted for the
door, dropping the note on the ground as she barreled into the stout oaken
planks. It fairly flew open, bounced against the wall and slammed shut
again.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She heard the board fall into place and lock the door as she had planned
but she did not hesitate to gloat in her victory. She had gotten a good look
at The dwarf and knew the plank would only slow him down a bit. It gave her
enough time to squeeze into the secret entrance of the sewers and splash
down into their murky depths. The foul water closed over her head as she
plummeted to the slime covered bottom of the cistern. Holding her breath,
she pushed off the bottom and started swimming for the sea port. Yes, Zsalshun
was going to be paying quite a bit more than first agreed on.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin didn't even slow down. He had heard the board drop on the other
side, effectively locking it, but it was of little import. He crashed armored
shoulder, helm, and axe into the door all at the same time. As expected,
several hundred weight of Steel, flesh, and bone did the trick. The door
fairly blew off its hinges, wood splinters and boards flying every which
way. By the time he had cleared himself of the wreckage, the nimble rogue
was no where to be found. The dark elf could have been none other than a
rogue, what with hiding in the shadows as she had done.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>With a fierce scowl, and a last quick look around, Balkin strode back
through the wreckage, and into the now gaping door frame. Fera was just standing
up from picking up a small slip of paper. "She dropped this Balkin, when
she started to run", Fera stated, handing him the note. Balkin eye'd her,
as he took the note, wondering if she had tried to read it, but decided no.
She was still innocent of the ways of the world, and bore her own sense of
honor. She would not have read it.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Glancing briefly at the letters on the outside of the note, he saw that
the note was indeed addressed to him, and in Zaslshun's writing as well.
Balkin strode over and leaned his axe against the wall again, next to the
forge, then opened the note to read.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Balkin-</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>As you may have heard, I have left the Winterborne house with Amber. I

<I>~Zsalshun"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The part written in dwarvish could only make him laugh though. Though
technically correct, she had a lot of work to do on learning proper inflection
in her writing. There was no flair to it, just kind of flat sounding when
read. No matter, he would work with her a bit some other time.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>It wasn't long before he was scowling again though. He would, of course,
be there at the appointed time, but couldn't help muttering to himself as
he finished the last few pieces of Amabala's armor. If she had stayed, this
wouldn't be a problem, and he wouldn't be wondering how hard he would have
to hit young Jaidon to keep him in line. Then there was appeasing Grolath,
who nearly had a fit at the sight of his back door.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin just threw him an extra set of Fine Plate Vambraces he had made.
"Here, sell em. Ye'll make far more than it will cost ye to have that poor
excuse fer a door fixed. By Brell, the lass here coulda shouldered it open."
This last bit said while pointing at the round eyed Fera, standing several
paces away. Grolath sputtered and grumbled, but relented when it looked as
if Balkin might take to tearing down the rest of the building.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Twas shortly after, that it began to grow dark. Balkin picked up his packs,
much lighter, though with a set of armor for Amabala in them now, and strode
off towards the Jade Tiger, Fera tagging along behind him. He didn't even
slow down, as he strode through the commons, just shouted for a meal for
2 to be ready in 15 minutes, then continued up to the adjoining rooms he
had rented for himself, and the young woodelf. He had her follow him into
his small room, and shut the door.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"I tell ye girl. I have work to do tomorrow eve. We're gonna pack up in
the afternoon, and head out into the commons. Yer gonna wait for me near
the outskirts of Freeport, and keep yerself hid ye hear? When I come back,
I'll tell ye what we're doing. I'm gonna get ye to Shivrehel sometime soon.
Yer memory needs jogging, and me axe ain't the way to do it. Now, get yerself
cleaned up, and meet me downstairs for dinner. Then we're gonna get a good
nights sleep. No tellin when we might get another."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin shoo'd her out of his room, and stripped off his armor quickly.
He washed himself, then belted his one handed axe, and warhammer around his
waist. Weren't no point in tempting fate eh?</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Quickly, he once again read the note Zsalshun had written, memorizing
it, then he put it in the lantern flame, and watched, as it was burned to
a crisp in the waste bucket. He broke up the ashes quickly, then headed
downstairs. There was still much to think on.</I>

<I>Fera stood in front of the door. &#147;Shivrehel.&#148; She repeated the
name over and over, trying to recall something about it. &#147;Where have
I heard that name before? I wonder who it is. He must be a kind man, if Balkin
thinks he&#146;ll help me.&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The wood elf returned to her room to clean up for dinner, as Balkin suggested.
When she turned the key to lock her door, she was overcome by a blast of
heat that cut right through her, as if someone had opened the very gates
of hell. The heat scorched the key and burned her fingers. She impulsively
let go, staring at her blistering fingers. Shaken, Fera furtively glanced
around the room.</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Zsalshun waited silently in the shadows of the huge mountain. It brought
back memories of her youth and time spent hunting the commons when she was
just a novice. Beyond the multi-temperate commonlands lay the rocky passage
to the desert. The vast dunes of sand would not be contained by a mere spine
of mountain and spilled over into the rolling plains of the land she looked
out onto from the shadowed valley of the lush southern mountain range. Behind
her were the cool depths of her homeland and certain death to the dwarf if
he should encounter the guards that patrolled the wood. Truly this side of
the world was much more diverse than the rather flat plains of the Karanas.
Part of her missed the days spent chasing cats, or being chased by ghouls.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Of course now it was but a thought and a gesture before the gibbering
undead exploded into nothingness. These days, it was Hill Giants, Cyclopses
and the odd Tesch Mesh Gnoll that was a challenge to her. In time too, that
would change as all things did. She sighed and pulled Amber closer to her.
She had not yet told the little elfling what she planned to do and did not
know if she had the courage to do so. All she had said was to grab the bunting
cloth and the largest and oldest of her father&#146;s books and make sure
that they were always safe. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>There were questions. There were always questions. Loures had come through,
although the fee she demanded was perhaps triple the original asking price
and both the cleric and the young high elf had slipped from the watchful
eyes of Jaidon. The priestess still worried though. Jaidon was very resourceful
and no doubt would try to find them again before the Priestess could get
back. Enchanters could be very sneaky like that and it bothered her.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Then there was the small ring on the little enchanter&#146;s finger. It
had cost her several pieces of her fine armor but she had been told that
it would keep the wearer from the sight of prying eyes. The priestess thought
it might cast the invisibility spell, however nothing happened when Amber
slipped it on. Loures had assured her that it worked and to have a tracker
try to locate the little girl if she did not believe her. Zsalshun wanted
to test it, but dark elves made poor trackers and there was no way to in
Neriak. Perhaps Balkin could help her out there as well. If the ring did
not work, she could take it up with the rogue later.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Now she waited. The moon crested over the hill and washed the passageway
with pale blue light. Soon, she should hear Balkin clanking his way to the
meeting point if he decided to come.</I>

<I>Jaidon had suspected that Zsalshun was up to something when she asked
him to catalogue the books in Makaz's library according to what they had
learned of the Arch Mage Winter. It was a menial task, one that Jaidon had
little patience for, and as far as he could tell, he had not done anything
recently that would call for such punishment.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>It was very difficult to catch up to the cleric and young enchantress,
once they had left their hidden rooms beneath the Blind Fish. Hardly impossible,
however, for someone accustomed to finding who and what he wanted when he
wanted them. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The black-robed enchanter followed them past the Commons and into the
Foreign Quarter, wondering just where they were going. He would assuredly
lose the two of them if they reached the forest. He did not want to reveal
himself to either of them though, and instead devised something more
subtle.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>A ring sat on Amber's finger, it twinkled magically. Perfect. The two
would be unsuspecting, to be sure. He was only slightly angered that the
priestess had underestimated him so. He did not know that he would soon be
meeting the hard shield of a dwarf, whose liquor added much padding to his
exterior. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Cloaking himself in invisibility, Jaidon walked behind the two in perfect
step. Timing was everything. The invisibility spell dropped from around him,
but he quickly faded from sight. An extra, tiny gemstone attached itself
to the ring on Amber's finger. In the soft, neon lights of Neriak, the gemstone
twinkled--a tiny laugh. He only hoped that Zsalshun had not heard the rustle
of his robes, or took the time to examine the ring before the three reached
their destination.</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The rogue toyed with the idea of following Zsalshun and her younger Tier
Dal charge, but there were things to do and delays to arrange. Besides, she
knew their destination and could set herself up waiting for them. The thief
spent her day arranging to have the young Tier Dal shadow delayed then set
off for the commonlands. She wanted to scout the place out a head of time
and set herself up to watch.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The night crept on hesitant feet as Loures settled in. She could stay
hidden for as long as she wanted, unlike the poor casters of this land who
were bound by the erratic dropping of their spell. She excelled at thievery;
she had been at it on three different worlds so far and it really did not
differ much from setting to setting. She smiled and waited.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The moon clawed it's way into the cloudless sky and an unusually warm
breeze puffed through the mountain. Loures looked quickly about as the hot
air, like the breath of some huge, beast breathed across her back. The small
hairs on her neck stood up on end and the thief crouched low in the shadows.
In a moment, the strange wind was gone but it left a feeling of apprehension
hanging in the air.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>A small noise in the valley alerted Loures that half of the parties had
arrived. Zsalshun and her small charge slunk huddled in the shadows. The
thief smiled. Now this truly was going to be something worth her while. What
was the cleric up to? Amber, of course, would be safe from magical scrying.
Loures had seen to that with the ring. The rogue did not want anyone knowing
what was going on before she did and that included any nosy caster sitting
comfy in their room somewhere waiving at a crystal ball or mirror or whatever
to see what the dark little elfling was doing. No, if they wanted to know
they could jolly well get their weak pathetic butts off their padded thrones
and follow the little child like she was going to.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She almost chuckled out loud. Let them try and find the child. The ring
she wore was a very good work of art from a world where detection meant death.
Even now the ring was at work, making the child inconspicuous. If you weren't
looking for her, your eyes would slide right off of her to somewhere else.
Then again, if you concentrated or were watching it was easy to combat the
ring&#161;&#175;s influence. She shrugged and listened for the arrival of
the second party. Presently she heard the jingle of heavy armor and she knew
either a dwarf or a brigade of guards were on there way.</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin headed down the hall towards the steps, after removing his armor.
Dinner would be waiting for him and the Wood Elf Fera. As he reached the
top of the steps, and started down, he readjusted his weapons belt. As he
did so, his hand brushed against the head of his newest weapon. The sizzle
of his flesh burning, nearly caused him to yelp out loud! He yanked his hand
away, and looked at the weapon. The head glowed red hot for a moment, causing
his leather jerkin to smolder a bit, and his side to be uncomfortable, then
it faded back to cold steel.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He stood there, on the top step, studying the hammer. True, the Runed
Branding Iron was a new weapon to him, and it did have a magical effect when
used that would cause a burst of flame to strike his opponent, but it had
never flared when not used in battle before. The back of his hand quickly
welted, then started to form a blister. Balkin scowled hard, grumbling about
poorly enchanted weapons, then continued down to the commons. He ordered
an ale, and watched the young elf come down the stairs, and silently join
him at the table. The food arrived at the same time she did, as did his drink.
She drank water, as she had since they had met.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Fera watched the dwarf eat, as she picked at her own meal. He never once
actually looked at his food, only the occasional glance, while cutting some
meat with his dagger. His eyes scanned the common room continuously. She
could only wonder what had caused him to distrust everyone so intensely.
There really wasn&#146;t much to say. He did not discuss his past, and she
had learned that when he had that look on his face, there was no arguing
with his decisions. She wanted to go with him, the next eve, but he had told
her to stay near the outskirts of the city, and stay hidden. Perhaps she
would follow him anyway, in case he needed her. With the noise his armor
made, he&#146;d never know she was there anyway, and she could hide easily,
when they reached his destination. A thought to consider anyway.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She winced, as the fork rubbed the blisters on the tips of her fingers.
Setting the fork down, she looked again, at the small blistered welts. She
had no idea what had caused the intense heat that had caused her to burn
her fingers on the key to her door. It had happened so quickly, and then
there was nothing. Not even residual heat on the key, just hot, then cold
as it had been. She had soaked them briefly in the cold water in the urn
in her room, but had not bandaged them yet.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The dwarves hand, shooting across the table, and snatching her wrist nearly
startled her off her chair! She looked at him quickly, and was surprised
by the intensity in his gaze, as he stared into her eyes. He growled at her,
&#147;Where&#146;d ye get them burns lass?&#148; Quickly, she stammered
&#147;Umm, In my room. When I locked the door to wash up, the key turned
red hot and burned me, then faded back to cold. It was so quick, that I thought
I had imagined it, till my fingers blistered.&#148; He looked again, at the
blisters, then in her eyes, and then, still gripping her wrist with his wide,
thick hand, he turned his own wrist. The back of his hand, with the large
blister turned into the light. Fera gasped, as she looked at it. &#147;What
happened?!&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin let go of her wrist, scowling, and leaned back in his chair, scanning
the common room again. &#147;Me hammer flared up, when I was comin&#146;
down the stairs. Burned me, then faded cold, same as your key.&#148; Fera
watched the hair, on his arms stand up on end. He gave a shiver, and said
&#147;That ain&#146;t natural. Seems to me we got burned at nearly the same
time. Somethin&#146; is happening, and I don&#146;t like it.&#148; Fera watched,
as the dwarf thought. He hid nothing well. His irritation, showed through
as he discarded option after option. Finally, he spoke again. &#147;Eat,
all of it. We&#146;re not gonna have time for a good meal for quite a while
if me guess is right. Then grab yer gear and bring it to me room.&#148; She
nodded, and ate. Inwardly, she sighed. It was more food than she wanted,
and she was very full afterwards, but she ate it. Balkin paid for the meal,
and they headed up to their rooms.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Fera didn&#146;t close the door this time, just grabbed all her gear,
and headed into Balkins room. She was surprised, to find him nearly fully
armored when she went in. He just glanced at her, as he finished suiting
up. &#147;Put yer things in the corner, and get some sleep.&#148; &#147;But,
what will you do?&#148; &#147;Bah, I&#146;m stayin up to watch. I&#146;ve
gone more days without sleep than I&#146;d care to count. And I&#146;ll go
many more fer sure. Now do it.&#148; The set of his face, told her he
wasn&#146;t taking any arguments. She smiled inwardly, and said under her
breath &#147;As usual&#148;, then lay down to sleep.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin was thinking hard. Zsalshun was obviously concerned for the
child&#146;s safety. She would want him to take her somewhere, and she wanted
it done without anyone knowing about it. It was there &#147;Where&#148; that
had him frowning, as he couldn&#146;t even begin to guess what the priestess
was thinking. Regardless, he was going to have to disappear for awhile, and
so was the child, and damn it, so was Fera, since she had been seen with
him. Scowling in the darkness of the room, he listened to the wood elf breath
quietly. He had to get her to Dirge/Shivrehel sometime soon, but it would
have to wait. She would be distraught at meeting the dark elf, that was for
sure. He had his honor, and would do nothing to deliberately harm the lass.
He would however, have to dredge her mind, to find what had been lost. That
would quite possibly be unpleasant, to be sure. Balkin&#146;s gut feeling
told him that Fera was a link to what they searched for. A cure for those
of the house with an affliction.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He kept watch, and thought throughout the night. Then made his decision,
not long before dawn.</I>
<P ALIGN=Center>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Fera awoke before dawn, to find Balkin sitting on the single chair within
the room, beside the closed, and shuttered window, watching the door. He
didn&#146;t move, just said &#147;Get cleaned up, and grab yer gear, we&#146;re
leaving.&#148; She nodded. It didn&#146;t take long, and they were walking
out the door. He first stopped at the vault, unloading the armor from his
packs, and withdrawing a bag of coins, then they headed to the western part
of Freeport, and bought them Breakfast at a stall there. He was agitated,
Fera could clearly see that. Whatever that note was, had him irritated, and
the events of last night, made him even more so. He was wound tight as a
lute string, ready to snap at any moment.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He led her to Eastern Freeport afterwards. This wasn&#146;t exactly the
best section of the city, and she was extremely nervous, as it seemed everyone
they passed was sizing them up, wondering if they could take them. She was
following so close to the dwarf, that she actually stumbled into him when
he stopped. Of course, she bounced off, he didn&#146;t even move. Growling,
he said, &#147;Stay back a bit girl! If I have ta&#146; swing me axe quick,
yer gonna get cut too, bein&#146; that close!&#148; Eyeing the huge double
bladed axe, she took two steps back, and nodded.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin scanned the street quickly, then ducked into a tiny, narrow shop,
motioning her follow. She did so, also looking around before she entered.
The tiny bell above the door jangled faintly, as she entered. The shop obviously
belonged to a potter. There were bowls, and utensils everywhere. They waited
a few seconds, but no one showed from the back of the shop. Balkin growled,
turned is axe to the flat side, and brought it slamming down on the counter
top. The resulting boom caused Fera to nearly jump out of her skin! A slim
human with a vicious curved dagger came through the curtain, with a smooth
yet rapid step, then stopped when he saw the armored dwarf.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He snarled, as he put the dagger between them, and slid into a defensive
stance. &#147;What do you want! I said I didn&#146;a want ye back in here!&#148;
Balkin snorted, and started twirling his axe in anticipation. &#147;Bah,
ye got no chance, same as ye didn&#146;t last time. I need some goods, and
yer gonna get em for me. And yer gonna do it quick, or I&#146;m gonna take
this place down around yer head, hear me!&#148; This last part was nearly
a roar. Silence reined. The human stood, snarling at the dwarf, who scowled
back. His grip tight on his axe, Balkin&#146;s knuckles started popping,
one by one as he grasped the haft of his battle axe tighter and tighter.
Finally the human shifted, and slammed the dagger into the counter top, burying
an inch of the blade, and left it there. Standing, hands on hips, he muttered,
&#147;Damn it. I really hate dwarves. What do you want?&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin slid from his defensive stance. And once again, glanced out at
the street. &#147;I need rings, and dieties. 3 rings that will prevent any
type of detection, be it any type of scrying, or a physical search. I need
2 rings that will protect against magical attack, or possibly fire, if ye
canna find pure magical protection. And I need two protection deities. And
I need them by mid afternoon at the latest. Bah, better make it 3 protection
deities&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The human changed his stance, and stood, fingers rubbing his stubble covered
chin. &#147;I have the deities&#148; Balkin nodded. &#147;I have rings that
will protect from magic. Though they are not the most powerful ones that
are known.&#148; Again, Balkin nodded. &#147;I ain&#146;t got nothing that
will prevent detection though. I&#146;ll have to find them, and that&#146;s
going to cost you.&#148; And a third time, Balkin Nodded. &#147;Aye, see
if ye can get better rings against magic while yer at it. If no, I&#146;ll
take the ones ye have.&#148; The human grumbled, as he yanked the dagger
from the counter, and hid it within his clothing. &#147;How you paying this
time dwarf? Saving my life once isn&#146;t going to cut it..&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin reached into a small pouch at his belt, withdrew 2 gems, and tossed
them to the human. Both were diamond. The human&#146;s eyebrows rose into
his hair, as he looked at them. Then he withdrew a small magnifying glass
from under the counter, and studied them in greater detail. Balkin said,
&#147;If that don&#146;t cover it, I have coin as well, but it damn well
better, or your suppliers are going to bleed.&#148; The human nodded again,
as he put the glass away, and hid the diamonds within his clothing. &#147;Aye,
it should cover it.&#148; The snort from Balkin, spoke volumes. I&#146;ll
be back, mid afternoon. Without a glance, he turned, and exited the shop,
Fera in tow. The door closed, and was locked, behind them.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>After wandering for hours through Freeport, with a mid day meal included,
they finally returned to the small shop, which was open for business again.
The human glanced through the curtain, as the door closed, and quickly motioned
them to come to the back. When the dwarf and Elf made it through the narrow
hallway there, it opened into a surprisingly large work and storage area.
The shelves were packed with finished, and partially finished stock. On a
small table, the human was unrolling a small leather wrap. In it, were several
rings. He silently handed one to both Balkin and Fera, motioning for them
to put them on. They complied, then the human spoke. Those are to protect
you from detection.&#148; Balkin studied the identical rings he and Fera
wore. The human handed the dwarf a third, identical ring, which was also
studied, then placed within a pouch. &#147;They date back to the combine
empire. Even older possibly. Not many of them around, and finding three used
up them diamonds all by themselves.&#148; Balkin scowled at the human, who
raised his hands as if to ward off a blow. &#147;I ain&#146;t lyin&#146;,
they were near impossible to find!&#148; He rapidly stammered out, &#147;The
rings that protect against magic weren&#146;t bad, and I got em cheap, so
it&#146;s not costin&#146; ya that much more.&#148; He handed over other
2 rings. Balkin tossed Fera one, and put the other in his pouch. &#147;Put
it on.&#148; She did quickly, then continued looking around the shop. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;Now these,&#148; the shop keeper said as he pulled out three small
clay totems, &#147;I make myself.&#148; He handed one to Fera and said,
&#147;Keep it on your person, not in a pack. You want it actually held, or
worn somewhere. It&#146;s magic will help protect you against blows from
weapons, as well as magic attacks.&#148; Fera took it, and studied it. It
was small, but she could feel a strange warmth from it, and there were small
specks of something sparkly imbedded within the clay. It had a small loop,
so she hung it from her belt, within easy reach. The human nodded, then turned
back to the dwarf, handing him the other two. Balkin took them, and tossed
the human a pouch full of coins. He then looked at Fera, and jerked his head
towards the door. He followed her into the narrow hallway, leading towards
the front of the store. The human called out, obviously frustrated. &#147;Hey!
I ain&#146;t counted this yet&#148; Inwardly, Balkin smiled Then called back,
&#147;It&#146;ll be enough.&#148; Door closing behind them, they heard a
last, &#147;Damn dwarves!&#148; Chuckling, Balkin pointed West with his axe.
&#147;That way girl, no time to waste.&#148;</I>

<I>The nighttime wind whispered through the valley heading into the dark
forest with little care about political, racial or class views. It was free
to go where it wished, unfettered by skin or religion. Zsalshun sighed and
looked towards the rolling plains of the commonlands, absently fingering
the symbol of Innoruuk she wore. A small tug on her cloak brought her wandering
mind back to the present.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>::Moma, what&#146;s wrong?:: The little fingers nimbly danced in the air.
The priestess smiled sadly and sat down next to the small child. Time had
passed and the dark elf illusion had worn off but here in the mouth of the
commonlands both were safe.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>::A great many things, little one, things you are not going to like.::
It was time to let Amber know what was going on. In the distance Zsalshun
thought she heard the familiar jangle of plated dwarf on the night air.
Amber&#146;s small face puckered up in ornery defiance but the elder elf
grabbed her hands before she could say anything. The priestess put a finger
to her lips and carefully concealed the child&#146;s hands as well as her
own in the folds of her cloak. Only she, the child and Fallon knew the hand
language and Zsalshun had become so paranoid for the child&#146;s safety
that she took every precaution she could to keep her out of danger. Even
if Fallon were the bush they sat next to she would not be able to see their
hands.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>::I need you to be a grown girl, Amber. Some people I know are bad people
but I have to work with them anyway. I can&#146;t keep you in Nerriak, and
I can&#146;t take you with me because they might hurt you.::</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The blue-green eyes flickered with worry. ::I can be invisible soon.::,
the fingers pleaded.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>::All the time?:: Zsalshun smiled and ruffled the pale hair. ::I won&#146;t
take that chance. A friend of mine is coming tonight and he will take you
away for a while.::</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>::Where? I don&#146;t wanna go Moma!::</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>::I&#146;m not sure. Show him the blanket if he asks. It&#146;s better
that I not know.::</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>::How will I talk to you??:: The look of worry was slowly dissolving into
something that was a cross between panic and fear.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>::You won&#146;t be able to. When it is safe, I will come get you, but
that may not be for a long time.::</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>::Moma, no!::</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Zsalshun bundled her distraught child up in her arms and held her. Amber
struggled to get free so she could say something, then quietly went limp.
Small soundless sobs racked the tiny body as the child realized she was going
to be separated from the only mother she had known.</I>

<I>As they strode rapidly through the city, Balkin&#146;s mind continued
to churn. Trying to strategize, when you had almost NO information could
be maddening. Then a thought struck. He stopped, scanned the shops, selected
a clothier, and strode inside. The human behind the counter greeted them
rather indifferently, and waited for them to make a selection. Balkin
didn&#146;t even stop to look. He strode up to the woman and said, &#147;I
need 2 sets o&#146; clothing for a female elf child. Both sturdy for travel,
and I&#146;ll need a cloak as well, She stands about so high, he indicated,
holding his had to his mid chest. &#147;Sir, I would be happy to fit the
child. Bring her to me and I can have it perfect in a matter of an hour.
&#147;Bah, she ain&#146;t here, and I need it now. Ye got anything close?
The lass here will alter it if absolutely necessary,&#148; he replied, pointing
to Fera.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The shop keep sighed, and nodded. &#147;Yes, I have some clothing of that
size, a moment please.&#148; The woman went to the storeroom behind the shop
and started rummaging around. Balkin waited impatiently, tapping the butt
of his axe on the wooden floor. The woman finally returned, with 2 dresses,
one plain but sturdy, and one rather pretty, yet sturdy as well. The cloak,
was a thick woven cloth that had obviously been treated to shed water.
&#147;This is the best I have at the moment, will they do for the child?&#148;
With barely a glance, he responded, &#147;Aye, what be the cost?&#148; They
haggled a moment, but not long. It was obvious that he was in a hurry, and
he paid probably twice the value of the clothing, just to shut the woman
up.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Striding out, Fera asked him, &#147;Who are the clothing for? And what
child do you speak of?&#148; Balkin glanced at Fera, and nodded. &#147;We
be meeting one o&#146; me mates, and her child. She worries for the girl&#146;s
safety, and it is me thinking that the child will come with us. If we&#146;re
to remain undetected, she&#146;s going to have to shed every single thing
she has, and leave it. That is why I have the rings, and the totem as well.
None of her personal things will go with us. Even a few threads from a favorite
shirt can often prove enough to track someone magically.&#148; Fera&#146;s
mouth hung open, at this announcement. &#147;I didn&#146;t know that!&#148;
He just nodded, and continued his trek.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>They strode through the gates, and out into the commons. Just past the
furthest reaches of the city wall, Balkin stopped. &#147;This be were yer
to wait, hear me?&#148; Fera nodded, and looked around. There were several
thickets of brush and trees in the area. Easy enough. Balkin rummaged in
his pouch, until he finally pulled out a woven grass necklace, with 3
intertwined, carved and polished wooden rings as a pendant. &#147;Hush for
a moment lass, and let me concentrate.&#148; Balkin removed his gauntlet,
and wrapped the necklace around his hand, pendant closed in his fist. He
closed his eyes, and brought his fist up to his armored chest. Clearing his
mind of other thoughts, he focused, picturing the one he searched for. He
could feel a connection made, mystical, weak, but more than enough. Whispering
in his mind, he said simply, &#147;Ellegon, I need you.&#148; The response,
though faint, was immediate. &#147;I come.&#148; With a mental nod, Balkin
released the link. Lowering his hand, he opened his fist to look. One of
the polished wooden rings was gone. Sighing, he placed the necklace back
in his pouch, and pulled on his gauntlet once again.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;What is the necklace Balkin?&#148; Fera asked quitely. Balkin just
shook his head. &#147;Wait.&#148; Several minutes went by. Balkin just stood,
looking out over the commons. Presently, a swiftly moving shape appeared
in the distance. As it neared their hiding place, the form took shape. A
wolf was running, and quickly. It came into the thick tree&#146;s, and shimmered
into the shape of a merry halfling. Impish smile in place, as always. Balkin
Grasped the halfings wrist in greeting, then turned to the elf. "Fera, this
be Ellegon. An old friend of mine. We will need his services presently, I
believe.&#148; With a smile, Ellegon greeted her, then turned to Balkin.
&#147;And what is going on here, my scowling friend? It is a good thing I
have a direct link to the necklace I gave you, or I would not have been able
to sense your location in this place. You have hidden yourself?&#148; Balkin
shed his gauntlet, and showed the ring to his Druidic friend. Ellegon studied
it briefly. &#147;Ah. A very, very old ring that is. Ancient in fact.
Combine?&#148; he asked, glancing at Balkin, who nodded. &#147;I sense it&#146;s
power, I cannot think of a scrying method that could penetrate it in fact.
You will be well served by it I think.&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Again, Balkin nodded. &#147;I nae have time for the specifics, but we
will need to leave quickly, once the time comes. Yer ability to teleport
is the only way I could think to do this. It will be we three, and an elf
child. Choose a destination as you wish, preferably a remote location. We
can make a more informed decision after we leave this place. Ellegon nodded,
then sat to meditate, and remember the feel of the place he would take them
too. Balkin turned, and studied Fera. &#147;Yer thinking of following
aren&#146;t ye?&#148; She felt herself blush, but could only nod. &#147;He
looked away, again, scanning the land below them. &#147;It don&#146;t matter.
I&#146;ve changed me mind. As I said to Ellegon, I think we&#146;ll need
to leave here quickly, so I want you with us.&#148; The smile that bloomed
on her face, made him shake his head. &#147;Calm down lass. Ellegon?&#148;
The halfling looked up, and nodded. &#147;I&#146;ll need both of you with
me, but invisible if you please. It is not necessary for others to know either
of you are with me. Not until the time comes for us to leave.&#148; With
an impish grin, Ellegon replied, &#147;As you wish, o&#146; clanking one.&#148;
Balkin muttered in his beard, then replied, &#147;Bah, just stay invisible,
and keep a few paces behind me. This could get ugly. Now, lets get this done.
We&#146;re going to the valley between here and Nektulos forrest. We&#146;ll
be meeting a dark elf, maybe two, and the child. Keep yer traps shut, no
matter what ye see or hear, and for Brell&#146;s sake, be as quite as
possible!&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He waited impatiently, as Ellegon cast invisibility on Fera, who faded
from sight, followed immediately by a spell cast on all three of them, allowing
them to detect invisible. Then he cast invisibility on himself, and nodded
that they were ready. Looking at the both of them with his magic'ed vision,
Balkin turned and stumped off towards the valley to Nektulos, as it started
to get dark. He deliberately, let his armor clank, and clang, trying to make
enough noise to keep anyone from detecting the two soft footed people behind
him.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Shortly, he entered the entrance to the valley. And started down the flank,
keeping mostly to the trees. It was not long, before a slight movement caught
his eye. It was a flash of steel, and as his eyes focused, he saw Zsalshun,
who had let a bit of her armor peek through the huge cloak she wore. She
was sitting, and as he approached, he noticed the back of the young elf&#146;s
head, sticking out of the cloak. The child was sobbing.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Glancing around, Balkin strode up to the priestess, stopping just 2 paces
away. Studying her hard expression, he nodded, and simply said,
&#147;Zsalshun.&#148;</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Zsalshun nodded to the approaching dwarf and stood up, picking Amber up
with her. The small child still had her head buried in her mother&#146;s
shoulder and clung with all her strength to her neck. Zsalshun ignored the
pressure the small arms put on her throat and simply soaked up the last minutes
she would have with her child. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;Zsalshun&#148; </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>In one word the dwarf managed to stuff a wealth of meaning. He waited
for her to start, shifting his weight after a long moment of silence. Finally,
the priestess decided that the time had come to begin this endeavor even
though no part of her really wanted to go through with it. She nodded, but
still held the silent child. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;Balkin. Thank you for coming. In short, I need you to take Amber
and hide her. I don&#146;t trust Dirge and I don&#146;t want my child used
against me should that one feel the need to do so. Take her somewhere safe
and don&#146;t tell me where she is. If you can hide her trail even more,
do so.&#148; She paused and stroked Amber&#146;s hair. &#147;I believe that
you and I are the only ones privy to this. I arranged to have Jaidon occupied
so I could slip away. That child is beginning to get on my nerves, but his
assistance in researching the Winter malady is helpful.&#147; </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin scowled in his customary fashion and set aside his axe. Nodding,
he said, &#147;Somehow, I knew that ye would be wantin&#146; that&#148;.
He reached into his pack and began pulling out a small bundle of clothing.
&#147;Here. Take all her things off and throw them in a pile over there.
Here&#146;s some clothes and a ring that will keep her hidden from the
pryin&#146; eyes o&#146; mages.&#148; Zsalshun&#146;s eyes narrowed as she
formed a protest to this new wrinkle the dwarf had added. Balkin matched
her gaze, grabbed his axe and thrust the head firmly on the ground. Planting
his feet he placed both hands over the up ended shaft and waited. He wasn&#146;t
budging until the girl-child was stripped down and re-clothed. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Zslashun breathed out, letting the protest go unuttered into the night.
She knew the dwarf well enough to know he was getting his way over this.
It was why she had asked for his help in the first place. &#147;She already
has a ring that will conceal her.&#148; Zsalshun set Amber on her feet, then
took the clothes and within the folds of her cloak began changing the sullen
child. &#147;So you won&#146;t need to re-&#133; &#147; </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The priestess stopped as an odd glinting from the ring on Amber&#146;s
hand caught her eye. She took up the small hand and examined the ring more
carefully. Somehow, a small gem had jumped onto the ring and nestled itself
next to the liquid black gem in the main setting. Zsalshun slipped the ring
from Amber&#146;s finger and held it up in the moonlight where she could
get a better look. &#147;That&#146;s odd, I don&#146;t remember this stone
being on the ring when I got it from Loures.&#148; </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;That the sneak I was tryin t&#146; decapitate in Freeport?&#148;
Balkin asked, but did not wait for an answer. &#147;Let me see.&#146; The
dwarf held out his hand for the ring. The priestess raised and eyebrow but
gave him the ring. She replaced it with the one Balkin had given her and
took out the bunting cloth. She watched a moment, as the armored dwarf brought
the ring up to his eye, and looked very closely at the setting.
&#147;Ain&#146;t part o&#146; the original ring. Been added since it&#146;s
creation. This ring be near as old as the one the lass be wearin&#146; now,
but the second stone and setting be shiny new! The child had the ring off
for any reason?&#148; </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He looked up again, as Zsalshun shook her head no to his question, then
she began to speak, this time in Dwarvish. &#147;This goes with you. No protests.
Amber will tell you what to do with it when you have gotten a good distance
away and are sure no one is following you. You might want to buy several
teleports. I am not sure who really cares about us but if some one in the
house has taken an interest simply walking or one teleport may not be enough.
Besides, she can explain what to do with the cloth somewhere other than your
final destination and you can decide how to proceed after. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin scowled at Zsalshun. She knew as well as he, that any object, could
be used to track someone magically. &#147;Don&#146;t give me that look, this
goes my way.&#148; &#147;Ye tryin&#146; ta&#146; make it more difficult
lass?&#148; Grumbling into his beard, he shoved the folded cloth into one
of his packs. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Weighing the ring again, he stared hard at the second gem. It was extremely
dangerous, to alter an enchanted ring. Especially one as old, and obviously
powerful as this one. Balkin closed his fist over it, then reached into the
pouch with his other hand. He pulled out the second ring he had, and dropped
to one knee next to the child. &#147;Amber, look at me.&#148; The child was
still sobbing silently, standing before her mother, but turned her face even
more into the priestess&#146;s cloak. &#147;Amber&#133;&#148; The dwarf waited
patiently. He could understand what the child was thinking, so was making
every attempt to be as patient as possible, but he had a feeling time was
running out. He glanced at Zsalshun, who&#146;s hard eyes were boring into
him. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Sighing after a few more moments, he reached out and easily pulled one
of the childs hands away from the dark elves waist, and held it in his hot
dwarven hands. &#147;Amber&#133;&#148; Finally the child turned her tear
streaked face to the dwarf. Balkin held up the second ring he had for her.
&#147;This is another ring to protect ye. The first to hide ye, and me,
see?&#148; Balkin held up his identical ring, &#147;And this second one to
help protect ye from magic. If the time ever comes, that someone tries to
cast a harmful spell on you, this will help you resist it, understand?&#148;
he asked, as he slipped the magical ring on the tiny finger, watching it
resize itself to fit. He then looked into the tiny elf&#146;s eyes, until
she gave a nearly imperceptible nod. Nodding back, he reached into his pack
again, and pulled out the small clay totem and a cinch cord. &#147;This be
a protection deity, made special fer ye. It too will protect ye. Not only
from magic, but from blows from weapons as well.&#148; He fit the cinch cord
around the childs waist, and tightened it, then handed the totem to the girl,
who released Zsalshun&#146;s waist, to examine it. A good sign, the dwarf
thought. &#147;Ye must either hold it, or wear it, for it ta work. Ye canna
put it in a pouch or pack, understand?&#148; Again the child nodded, hanging
the totem from the cord Balkin had tied around her waist. The dwarf gave
a slight smile. The child was extremely intelligent, that much was certain.
</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>A slight movement caught his eye at that moment. It was Ellegon moving
ever so slowly, and silently, trying to get into the dwarves vision. When
the merry halfing was sure he could be seen, he raised his arm, and pointing
out to trees and brush, on the far side of the clearing. Leave it to a halfling,
to be unheard, amongst elves. As he stood from his kneeling position, Balkin
made sure he was turned so he could see the spot Ellegon had pointed to.
Not wanting to stare, he let his vision soak in the location, as he scanned
all of the surrounding woods. Suddenly, she came into focus. And he would
bet his beard, it was the same dark elf woman that found him in Freeport,
and subsequently, been chased away. The question now, was whether the woman
was Zsalshun&#146;s backup here, protection of a sort, or was she unwelcome.
He let his eyes rest on the halfling for a split second, while he scanned
the woods all around, and gave a twitch of his eye, letting it be known that
he saw her. If not for his magic&#146;d vision, he would never have known
she was there. </I>
<P ALIGN=Center>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin scanned the woods, locating Fera behind him, who had tears in her
eyes, witnessing this sorrowful event for the priestess and child. Growling
inwardly, he was glad that she was at least silent about it. He carefully
stowed the altered ring into the now empty bag from the shop keeper in Freeport
and drew the strings in tight. The dwarf had never heard of someone being
able to counter a concealment ring, but he did not know much about the higher
workings of magic either. If someone wanted to look in on the small high
elf child, let them try to look from inside the bag all they wanted. Right
now, he needed his hands free. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He looked at Zsalshun and nodded slightly in the direction of Loures'
hiding place. "Ye got anyone else with ye? As a backup perhaps, to protect
ye?&#148; Zsalshun frowned at him. &#147;Who would I trust? There is no one
with me.&#148; Balkin nodded, as he made a decision. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;Ellegon, Root her.&#148; </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>As the words left his lips, the halfing appeared, already in mid cast
of his spell. There was no smile on his face now, only anger, and urgency.
At the same time, Balkin charged towards the brush. A screech was heard,
as the grasping roots tried to hold the dark elf woman, but fell away. Ellegon
shouted &#147;She resisted, and is now out of range!&#148; The woman sprinted
deeper into the woods, and Balkin stopped in the middle of the clearing.
It was impossible to catch her, as he had not had Ellegon bless him with
Spirit of the Wolf in advance. Growling and muttering, he returned to the
group. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He scowled at Zsalshun as he clanked back up to her. &#147;I suggest you
kill her. If I ever see her again, I will.&#148; Balkin stopped short, as
he saw Ellegon. His jaw dropped open, and he could only laugh, as the fool
halfling did a backflip, then jumped straight up in the air, higher than
he was tall. He then made a wooden loop disappear in his hand, and reappear
behind Amber&#146;s ear, followed by climbing his staff, and balancing on
the top of it, standing on one foot. Such balance and dexterity was always
astounding. The child was smiling for the first time since they had met just
minutes before. Silently, he thanked the halfing for what he was doing. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Reaching out, he grasped Zsalshun&#146;s wrist in farewell and said quietly,
&#147;We&#146;re leaving. No telling what else will happen now. Ye have my
word, the child will be hidden, and protected. No harm will come to her.
Not unless I be dead already.&#148; </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He watched, as Ellegon continued entertaining the child, then called
&#147;Amber, it is time.&#148; She child turned, and ran back to Zsalshun.
Tears flowing again. She started fluttering her hands, Zsalshun doing the
same. Frowning, he wondered what they were doing. Saying goodbye?</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>While the child, and the priestess said their goodbyes, the dwarf turned
to Ellegon. Opening the pouch, he removed the ring and quickly handed it
to Ellegon. "What do you think?" Ellegon took it, and looked hard. He then
wispered a small spell. Shaking his head, he said, "The rings is strong.
Very strong. The sparkling gem is not part of it though. It is attached,
but not the ring. Does that make sense?" Scowling in near seething fury,
Balkin thought it did. The halfling returned the ring with a perplexed shrug,
and Balkin quickly stuffed it back in the pouch, pulling the drawstrings
tightly shut, and knotting them&#133;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>After a long moment, the Priestess knelt down and hugged the child fiercly.
She freed her hands and circled them in an odd pattern in the air, then kissed
the small elf on the forehead. Amber seemed to shrivel up in misery, but
gave no objection to being turned towards the waiting dwarf. She looked into
his eyes, large tears dropping soundlessly down her cheek and took a small
step towards him. Balkin pulled his gauntlets on, hung his axe on it&#146;s
holder over his back, then held out his hand to her. Amber looked up at Zsalshun
again, then slowly walked over to the dwarf. He pulled out the cloak he had
for her, and tied it around her shoulders. It was long, and brushed the ground,
but Fera could fix that, or he could honestly. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He then grasped her hand, and stood, looking at Zsalshun.
&#147;Ellegon,&#148; was all he said. The halfing grinned widely, and nodded.
He concentrated, spell energy gathering around him. As the sparkling smoke
surrounded them, Balkin looked down at the bag holding the ring with the
odd sparkling gemstone. At the last second, he tossed it to Zsalshun, who
caught it with both hands, and said &#147;Take yer dagger, and stab that
stone. Pry it off. Then wear the ring. Somethin&#146; tells me yer gonna
need it.&#148; He nearly shouted to be heard, over the thundering of the
spell, "And burn them clothes! No links left!" </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Zsalshun nodded, and waved at Amber, as spell energy gathered around them,
and each stepped through shimmering portals, and disappeared.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>(( This and the post above are a colaberation, between Zsalshun and I

<I>After the three had departed from the forest, Jaidon decided that his
form would not be needed anylonger. He did not like the tone in Balkin's
voice either, when he threw the ring back to Zsalshun. It was no longer safe
to remain concealed.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The gemstone summarily faded from the band, and standing before the priestess
in his flowing black robes was the scowling enchanter. "Care to explain before
I make my report to my father?"</I>
<P ALIGN=Center>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Zsalshun boggled at the ruffled enchanter as he burst forth with his demands.
Where had HE come from? The valley was crawling with people. First it had
been Loures, although Zsalshun was not too surprised at this. The sneak had
found someone who could translate dwarf apparently, however the cleric was
confident that Balkin could arrange for several teleports to throw the rogue
off their scent. Then there was the halfling who had materialized from nothing
and had attempted to capture Loures. Now Jaidon had randomly appeared. Zsalshun
wondered who else would be stepping from behind the shadows or out from just
plain thin air.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The young enchanter stood scowling at her, no doubt upset that she
hadn&#146;t included him in her every move. She did not see the point as
he seemed to have no trouble sticking to the cleric and young enchantress
as if he were a pert of them. She wondered how he had tagged along this time.
He was full of bluster and indignation and if she wasn&#146;t mistaken, he
appeared a bit rumpled about the edges. Still holding the bag Balkin had
tossed her, the dark priestess mulled over young Jaidon&#146;s curt question.
Explain what? What did she care of what the elfling said to his father? Amber
was safe now and that was all that mattered to her at the moment. She shifted
her weight and tilted her head slightly to one side.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The priestess heard a metallic &#145;ping&#146; and felt the vibration
of something small hitting her boot. She looked down. There on the ground
nestled between her boot and a clump of crab grass was the ring with the
mysterious hitch-hiking gem, only the newcomer gem was no where to be found.
She frowned and picked up the ring. Nowhere on the setting did she find that
small mysterious gem. She turned the bag over in her hands and started to
chuckle when she found the entire bottom blown out.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She looked again at Jaidon and his slightly frumpled form standing so
tall and angry. The priestess stifled a laugh. What a clever mind this one
had and his plan would have worked too if Balkin had not been so paranoid.
No one would have been the wiser and the ring with it&#146;s enchanter gem
would now be halfway across the world. Instead, Balkin had insisted Amber
leave everything behind, including the ring and that had drawn attention
to the young man turned gem. The priestess bit back another laugh as she
realized that the enchanter, clinging desperately to the ancient setting,
was up until a moment ago safe from discovery.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The three, the dwarf, the cleric and the halfling, had all been suspicious
of the gem but not one of them had guessed it&#146;s true secret. She was
sure each had thought the gem some sort of enchanted addition, rather than
an enchanter addition. Tears of mirth welled up in her eyes as she thought
about the poor enchanter, stuffed in a bag and destined to be pried off of
his perch. To have an almost perfect plan foiled so must really grate on
the young man&#146;s pride. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Zsalshun choked back a giggle as she held up the ring and the bag. Jaidon
did not look the least bit amused, which shook waiting giggles loose from
behind clenched lips. The young man was more annoying than a bed full of
lice at times but he did have a sharp mind which would be an asset in wading
through the volumes of material her father had left. Unfortunately, his present
attempt to recover his dignity after being banished into the bag struck the
priestess as particularly funny. Oh how he must have seethed at the chance
discovery. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Tears streamed down her face and she did not trust herself to talk so
she waved her hand at the young boy in reply to his question. The bag flapped
in the air as she did so, loosing bits of weave from the torn underside.
A chuckle escaped as the strands of cloth floated lazily to the floor of
the valley, then another chuckle until Zsalshun could no longer hold her
composure. Gales of laughter fought each other to be the first out of her
mouth and she doubled over as they all came spilling out at once.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>After a time, she was able to catch her breath again between bursts of
giggles and she discovered that the laughing fit had actually had a calming,
cleansing effect. She had been so tense and wrought with worry over Amber
for such a long time that it had become almost second nature. Now that the
child was safe she needed to purge the negative feelings and the
enchanter&#146;s predicament had helped her do that. Wiping her eyes on her
cloak, she realized she had somehow toppled over onto the ground and sat
firmly planted on her posterior. She chuckled again as she tossed the useless
bag aside.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Negligently she waved her hand in the air, still chortling as she did
so. &#147;Really, I don&#146;t care what you say to your father. Actually,
I don&#146;t care about your father much at all so go do what ever you want
to do. I&#146;m going back to Nerriak and my books. Somewhere there are clues
to this Malady and I intend to find them. You are still welcome to come
along&#133;I&#146;ll even clear out a pocket if you want a ride back.&#148;
The priestess held up the ring and burst into a fresh batch of giggles.</I>
