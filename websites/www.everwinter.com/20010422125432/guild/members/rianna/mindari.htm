	      <I>Be true to one's self and thee shall see the blinding light of God. I
	      serve my God to the utmost of my ability, and only serve Vox at the sufference
	      of Him. &nbsp;He guides my hand in all, and blesses me with His powers. May
	      the Celestial One watch over you, as he does over me. If you are worthy,
	      you will be one with Him, and blessed with the power of his spells. Low is
	      the one who watches His power flutter away from my hands, and has been found
	      wanting!</I>

	<I>Mindari is a new born cleric. She has been sheltered all her life in the
	temple of Celestian. He is often seen as Tunare, mother of all, but shows
	Himself when he deems it fitting.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Mindari was found as a small child, beaten and abused by unknown assailants.
	Since she was of elven descent, she was taken to the city of Felwithe and
	entrusted to the care of the priests and nuns of the city. She has been raised
	as a cleric, and accepts that as her true calling. A revelation occurred
	to her in the forest one eve, and it was then that she learned the truth
	of her God and his plans for her. She is his representative in this realm,
	and is to do all in her power to aid Vox, with his blessing. She has been
	instructed to accept a mentor, Lady Flutrose, and will do her bidding as
	well.</I>
