<I>Aulura sat in contemplation as her body was slowly swayed by the slow
moving boat. Her journey was moving her to Erudin, and then to Kerra Isle
next to explore the isle and perhaps skin a few cats. <BR>
<BR>
As she sat there she contemplated what might be a fitting second name for
her. What would show some of what she is perhaps? Or perhaps something to
show her dedication to Veeshan? She quickly did away with the idea of showing
her servitude to Vox, the bracelet she was forced to wear was enough dedication
to Vox for her liking. Perhaps a name with music to it to show her dedication
to being a bard? Or perhaps something as auluring as her first name? The
ideas were endless&#133; then the name came to her, almost as if a
vision&#133;<BR>
<BR>
Veeshanaire&#133;<BR>
<BR>
That would be her new second name, a name that bespoke of both Veeshan and
an aire of music. Perhaps few would notice it, but it was her name now and
she would hold it in her reverence of Veeshan and her dedication to her
kin.<BR>
<BR>
Aulura Veeshanaire, the serpentine priestess of Veeshan, or rather bard&#133;
Aulura grinned to herself, content in her knowledge of herself a priestess
and not simply the singer she had everyone believe she was. The way of dragons
have often had much in the way of song and calling, she knew that and she
knew what she was, even if few others truly saw it.<BR>
<BR>
She left the boat and traveled through Erudin, deciding she would be attempting
to find her way eventually into Paineel, which she was sure she could trick
even them with enough trial.<BR>
<BR>
She sat down at the edge of the Water of Kerra Isle and enjoyed it&#146;s
coolness amidst the unwitting and unknowing cats.</I>
