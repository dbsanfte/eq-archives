<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>As usual, the swamp was alive, full of creatures bustling about their
simple lives. Insects sang and bull frogs croaked, creating a cacophony that
was soothing to Biancha. She was reminded of the alligator skin plaque that
hung outside Ragnor&#146;s shack, &#147;Hom Swea Tom.&#148; She&#146;d trekked
through the swamps and beyond a handful of times but this&#151;this was home.
</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She waded through the tepid waters, her eyes deftly tracking a pair of
fungusmen in the distance. She licked her colorless lips and decided their
heads would make a tantalizing addition to the froglok stew Zimbittle was
so famous for. Zimbittle was one of the best bashers in Grobb. Biancha admired
her braun and delighted in sparring with her occasionally. She always paid
dearly for it, bruised and battered the next day. But oh, it was great to
hear Zimbittle&#146;s words of praise when she survived a bout. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>As she neared her prey, a runner ran to her with a message from Grobb.
&#147;Mama needs you quick. Go!&#148; The troll messenger grunted at Biancha
and shoved her. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Biancha shoved him back and grinned broadly. &#147;Danks. I go now.&#148;
</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The shack was dark inside. Biancha heard a whimper from behind the tattered
rug that separated the sleeping area from the eating area. She found her
mama, who happened to be one of the oldest witch doctors in Grobb, administering
some putrid ointments to her da&#146;s festering sores. If anyone could heal
him, she could. He&#146;d been suffering from a rare swamp malady for the
past few months. But the last few days had been the worst. Biancha did her
best to stay away. She couldn&#146;t stand to see her father so vulnerable
and in so much pain. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Her mother saw her standing in the doorway and grunted disapprovingly
and waved her away. &#147;Biancha wait out there.&#148; </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Biancha bowed her head and decided to wait outside the hut. The dank smells
of the swamp were refreshing in comparison to the smell of death that hung
in the air of the dingy shack. She sat down heavily on a worn stump and picked
at the dirt with a stick while she waited for her mother. Finally, the wooden
door creaked open and her mother hobbled out. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;It&#146;s time fer Biancha to go. Spirits tell me. Listen up, girl.
You make family proud. Spirits say some dragon in north has work fer you.
You go. Meet these people and&#133;&#148; Biancha&#146;s mother stopped speaking
abruptly and whacked Biancha on the arm with her walking stick. &#147;Is
IMPORTANT! Listen up! You do good work, dis dragon promises cure fer your
da. Git it? I packed grub already. You go now. Meet tiny man with swift feet
at entrance to ogre land. He show you way.&#148; </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Biancha took one look at the dilapidated shack and grinned madly. &#147;Yah,
I go now!&#148; She stood, kissed the wort on her mama&#146;s chin, and grabbed
the sack from her. The thought of leaving the swamp was scary, but definitely
a better prospect than spending one more night in that shack.</I>
