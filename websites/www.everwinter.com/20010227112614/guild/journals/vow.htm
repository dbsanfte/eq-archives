<I>The dark elf perched in an embrasure of the Citadel Draconis, resting
unseen, but observing in his perpetual, reticent gloom. His midnight blue
skin sank into the evening, blended with the deep backdrop of the room barely
visible from the courtyard, and flowed into the dull, black metal that comprised
the keep. The adamantite was cold, but not nearly as frigid as the aura that
surrounded the violet-eyed oddity. Unruly wisps of bone-white hair danced
in the sudden breezes that blew close to Forbidden Isle, close to his home
domain of Darkmoon on Storm Isle. In the distance, the waves of the Blood
Sea rose to urgings of the Powers that moved the wind. He listened carefully,
not because he believed what the would-be-Gods had to say was important;
rather, he waited on the omens that hinted at their weakness and suggested
the time to act. A greater power moved behind the order of the universe,
and the Cimmerian fae the humans called "Dirge" had a notable interest in
what that power had to say.<BR>
<BR>
The recent days had been difficult on him and the vicinity of the citadel
didn't ease his tortured mind. The rips in the planes placed the Waste nearer
than he thought possible. The soft oblivion of the Gray beckoned him day
and night, though it was always worse when a moon blossomed over the Land
and reminded him of lost titles. The silent hum of despair reverberated in
his ancient bones. The Spire sang of it, an endless metallic echo. The moon
was present, an unblinking half-eye, entrancing mortal and immortal alike.
He extended his senses, past the Tyrsis Gelare and his fellows of Io's blood,
soaring over the sea in the middle.<BR>
<BR>
The deepling slept below the waves, like their counterparts on the shore,
watery snores muffled in fields of kelp. While the usurping First Borne had
claimed much of the water, there was a debt owed to the one known as Sekolah.
The Great White Shark sided with Dirge, during the wars, suffered much, and
lost ground. An uneasy acceptance of the situation had developed in the past,
during the reign of the Aerie. The Dark Song's recent return caused some
concern among the old ties, but he had expected that; had timing been less
of a concern, perhaps the situation could have progressed more diplomatically.
No one really trusted the dragons; too much knowledge had accumulated in
those racial memories. Ultimately, he'd turn on Sekolah and his race of deepling,
feeding them like so much chum to his topaz and bronze fellows.<BR>
<BR>
He whispered in a low, soft voice, a surprisingly gentle sound in the deep
of the night. "Io, my Creator, Creator of Life and Death&#133; is it time
to make the truth known?" He listened carefully. The multitude of gulls that
prowled near Forbidden Isle scavenged the shore for fleshy treats. The waves
stilled, slightly, and the dark elf could almost feel the crisp spray of
foam on his earthen seeming.<BR>
<BR>
He prayed again. His voice reflected barely suppressed pain and lost some
of the calm it normally exuded. "Chronepsis, facet of the Power, mother of
my destiny, I--"<BR>
<BR>
--A gull flew away from the flock, white against the sky and dark against
the moon. It circled twice, as if preparing to land, then tucked wings to
its sides and plummeted into the rocky shore. Dirge shared the last sensations
of the frail avian. His hollow bones snapped. His quills splintered. His
blood trickled from his beak. The salty vitae pooled in the tide, but the
waves carried it out.<BR>
<BR>
Dirge managed a closed-lipped smile, and tilted his head back, closing his
baleful eyes. He could still see the gull, feel the blood draining from it.
"The truth bleeds dark, mother--dark and potent."</I>

<I>Time fled, though the vision remained clear, as it always did. A knock
came shortly after the Orb Above rose in a spectacular spilling of yellow
fingers and fiery nails. The dark elf didn't turn to answer. "Enter, Cade."
No one else would have survived the glyphs, not even the proxies of the
Powers.<BR>
<BR>
Behind him, within the confines of Tyrsis Gelare, also known as the Dark
Song Spire, an oddity entered on two legs. In many ways, Cade resembled his
mother's seeming; like the dark elves of Toril, his skin was pitch-black.
His ears rose in sharp points. His eyes were embers, possessed of a burning
hue. Unlike the drow, his skin had a iridescent quality to it, the fine scales
catching the flickering braziers that barely lit Dirge's quarters. His mouth,
when opened, revealed crooked, sickly fangs. His viciously spiked armor revealed
a bit more of his unnatural heritage. <BR>
<BR>
The other half of Cade's heritage was the spawn of the demonic fiends known
as tanar'ri. It showed, both on his person in and his actions. The dark elf
admired him for the stoic defiance that defined his existence. Dirge found
him on Azzragat after tracking down the cambion's mother, the dark elf's
eldest daughter, Talabrina. Oddly, Cade had needed such incentive, such a
flame for his defiance. He detested his father, the lord of Azzragat, Grazz't,
and his mother for diluting his draconic blood. His grandfather was a tie
to the freedom and nobility he craved. He'd served as the dark elf's personal
guard for over three decades without incident and anyone who could provide
such a service to one of the First Borne deep dragons was worth his weight
in platinum.<BR>
<BR>
"M'lord&#133;thy Orb of Io has been activated." His voice was a soft rush
of broken glass, but one that could be a harsh order with his charges.<BR>
<BR>
Dirge nodded, pulling his purple cloak tightly about his bony shoulders.
"By?"<BR>
<BR>
"Mykell, herself, m'lord." Cade awaited the dark elf's reaction, pensive.
On hand rested on the hilt of a falchion. While the cambion preferred the
comfort of a bardiche, quarters were restricted and the impressive edge of
the weapon favored by the denizens of Guntu's land suited his strength
well.<BR>
<BR>
Again, Dirge nodded. The ancient amethyst custodian knew Dirge posed a threat.
She hadn't a clue what he represented, but she feared him. She had ceased
actively maintaining the balance long ago and enforced only a policy of
systematic decline. "Because I lord over three Domains, now, their lords
mysterious abdicating in my favor. What a shocking dragoness is she, eh?
They'll want me to give up Darknight and Lastlight. Was their mention of
Eversand or my holds on Fireshore and the Ice Sea Isles?"<BR>
<BR>
Cade shook his long mane. "Nae. They mentioned the unprecedented representation
of three domains by one dragon. And&#133;" he hesitated briefly, then continued,
"the incident in Velf."<BR>
<BR>
The incident. It was such an amusing way to refer to Dirge's continued observance
of the First Borne on the continent known as Solon. The Council had ruled,
long ago, that only First Borne remaining on the Land at the Center could
permit their servants access to the land from which humans evolved. They
didn't consider Dirge part and parcel to Io's Blood, though he had existed
far longer than the wyrms that composed the Council, itself. "And the identity
of the witnesses?"<BR>
<BR>
Cade replied without hesitation. "zu'Rianna the Red of clan Blisterclaw,
Lady of the City of One Thousand Tales, and cn'Olam Cz of clan Battlewing,
Grand Lord Advocate of Seaside, the one--"<BR>
<BR>
The dark elf snapped an interruption. "The one who has foiled Mire's attempts
to infiltrate Water's Edge and, thus, the Bronze Cliffs. What of the one
who calls herself Rianna? What information do ye have on the brass?"<BR>
<BR>
"She is destined to rule Blisterclaw. She was adopted by Lord Mazzerane and
has been trained in combat and magic by the ancient brass known as the White
Leopard." Cade stopped. Dirge turned to face to look over the sun-dappled
sea, his eyes burning.<BR>
<BR>
"She'll have seen my revenge on the last followers of Wren and her Covenant.
However, she'll have to explain her purpose in Velf, as will the bronze.
That will, undoubtedly, expose their benefactors. Alert my holdings. They
will rouse themselves from their slumber and be in attendance." He dismissed
Cade with a quick and silent gesture.<BR>
<BR>
The dark elf had time to meditate and his mind drifted. The importance of
this meeting would shape the future of the Conclave, give it the strength
and power it needed to stand a chance. He contemplated those that would be
in attendance and the twists of the hour glass that brought them to the
table.</I>
<P ALIGN=Center>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Where were you last night?" she whispered with a sudden harshness.<BR>
<BR>
Kate's tawny bangs stuck to her furrowed brow, dead like the leaves that
drifted on the lazy October haze. From narrowed eyes she traced the path
of each falling skeletal corpse, each leaf's veins like bones under flaking
skin. They spiraled slowly from the heights of outstretched, thinning branches
to the worn flagstone path, settling down on uneven perches. Over the decade
Kate had been living in the Covenant, each season of ice and thaw had further
cracked winding trails through the garden. Now the court was a mass of overgrown
herb plots, crumbling rock, and quiet, haunted places. But today the serenity
was particularly oppressive.<BR>
<BR>
The failing light was supplemented by a dim globe of azure, its whispers
suspended magically between her long fingers like webs. Her invocation,
ironically, illuminated nothing and through shadows like claws. She'd been
counting on him. <BR>
<BR>
She sat up straight, and remembered his chiding, how he'd called her "silly
girl-crone" when she hunched over the dark mirror, calling his name. From
the weathered oaken seat, Kate contemplated what she could have done wrong,
what potential foe she'd overlooked. Had she displeased him? Her studies
were fruitful. She'd even been complemented on by Sister Wren. He should
have been trilled to hear that. The venerable Sister was lecturing for an
afternoon on the importance of an education in classical demonology. The
novices had giggled at the Sister's cracked, feeble voice. Sister Wren's
teeth had decayed in pace with the garden Kate now sought refuge in. But
Kate had been listening.<BR>
<BR>
She sat straight in her desk, never resting her head on her folded hands.
At first, that had been her temptation. He had warned against such posture.
Kate struggled through months of trying to be motivated. When Lila was tardy
and Rianna missing altogether, she had gone to every lecture. She actually
did her double translations of Yeats and Coleridge; the old tongue was led
into the Art and back again, until it became a matter of habit. Sister Wren
had noticed. While Rianna was more skilled in the art, Kate had discipline.
She followed the steps in every summoning, tracing the iron dust into the
Circle three times each conjuration, no matter how trivial. Then he had told
her rigid schooling wasn't enough.<BR>
<BR>
Kate had taken his advice and found a hobby, if just for his smile. The
restoration of the fount was tedious work. The onyx had been left unattended
for many, many years--perhaps a century. The notes from the last three Keepers
mentioned nothing of cleaning the ornate centerpiece that was once a part
of a the Steward House in Fenzul. By the Stewart House she didn't refer to
the current noble family, led by Duke Lewis Stewart and renowned for nothing
more than wine making; she referred to the ancient House, when the elven
race was split. Theos, the Power of the elves, had given three children to
the Stewart house to unite them--Banos, Kalina, and Bianca. The fount was
said to have belonged to the dark sister, Bianca, mother of the dark elven
race. As such, it wasn't mentioned at the Covenant. While truth was of import,
there was no need to harbor knowledge of the drow. The people of Velf, the
people that allowed the Covenant in their vicinity, had been forever altered
by Bianca's offspring and their narcotic, Nygrua fruit.<BR>
<BR>
The arduous trek to the library was more than a physical journey. Politics
between Velf and the Fenzul Directorate were strained. When word of Sister
Amylene's approaching journey made its way to Kate's ears, she begged to
accompany her. Again, her peers had jeered that she'd gone mad. Imagine being
on hands and knees for a fortnight in stale halls stacked with nothing more
than musty, forgotten tomes. And there were the rumors of her conversations
with the fount, the moon, mirrors. "Too much in the crystal, Katie!" Lila
had giggled. Yet, he'd suggested the trip, very quietly, as he always did.<BR>
<BR>
Oh, she didn't regret what she'd done. It was nice to get away from her home.
Kate wasn't ever terribly comfortable with Lila, her roommate. It wasn't
as if Lila was a bad girl or anything. She took the art seriously and was
advancing through the ranks as expected. But Lila spoke with the others.
She snuck out at night with the others. She'd even been with a boy. Kate
didn't go along with the trends of the other students. She followed the rules
and was rewarded for her effort... . But sometimes that wasn't enough to
ease the distance between herself and her peers. She wasn't popular or well
liked. Worse yet, she wasn't even disliked. She was simply ignored, gajin
to the social etiquette of the Covenant. He had said that didn't matter.
Her human blood was a rarity, but her descent from common folk was even rarer.
It all conspired to make her very bland, a milk-maid wearing the robes of
a novice.<BR>
<BR>
She'd longed to speak with someone. He had answered. Normally, Rianna was
around, but that was a furtive thing at best. She has so little in common
with the young lady who made no promises and took no Vows. It was as if she,
Rianna, was governed by nothing save the fickleness of the sea, rolling into
the Covenant and out again like the moon-governed tides. Who could tell which
of the moons ordered Rianna. Still, Kate missed her and knew she would be
the one before her in the Ritual. As would He.<BR>
<BR>
Kate stood, adjusting her cloak against the slight chill. Farther down the
path was her charge as the Keeper, and she knew of no better way to pass
time. Her delicate steps skirted the leaves as best she could. The multicolored
carpeting was thickening as Ritual approached. She could almost see her steps.
She imagined she looked like a performer on hot coals. Somehow, she couldn't
bring herself to disturb the leaves; it was as if they had some indefinable
aura of sanctity around them, warding off such young feet, such living
thoughts.<BR>
<BR>
The fount was beautiful in the light of the sinking sun. The black stone
reflected her face in inky reverse. Her bright summer eyes weren't even glowing
embers, just reflective pools, deep and with something stirring under their
waters. She worked the polish over the fine lattice. Kate's long, pale fingers
courted the curves and danced among the graceful adornment.<BR>
<BR>
She felt a certain sensual delight when restoring the fount. It was as if
the gargoyle's faces were forbidden. They represented a very old and dangerous
way, yet she toyed with the smoothness. She touched the course of their cheeks
to the jawbone, and wished they were more than bas-relief. Something wild
in her wanted to wind her hands around their thick necks and pull them into
an vicious embrace. Kate could almost feel the rock arms around her,
unbreakable.<BR>
<BR>
And there was one face in particular. He was an oddly handsome nether creature.
He wasn't smiling or leering like the others, but Dirge (what the Elders
termed him) had the eyes of a saint. They were as deep as the sea and her
light splashed over their raven stare. She could see herself within those
eyes. He was the challenge that was forbidden to her, the one thing her studies
made her doubt and struggle with. And her last Vow, the Passing, would forever
seal Him from Her, for she would have the power to... . Kate wanted to kiss
his lips, lingering there until all the stars had fallen--<BR>
<BR>
"Kate?" squeaked a voice from a turret high above. Instinctively, Kate collected
her thoughts and feigned concentration, rubbing out marks on his chin.<BR>
<BR>
There was a sigh and a muted conversation with someone else. "Kate!" drifted
down again, louder and more shrill. She turned about, looking up three stories
to her room.<BR>
<BR>
The shutters were open, emerald paint peeling in great strips. Lila's face
looked even more like a bird of prey as she surveyed the grounds from her
elevated sprawl. "Katie, I need to meditate. Can you not come up until one
strike?" She turned around, speaking to someone within the recesses of the
loft. She turned back with an impish grin. "Make that two strikes!"<BR>
<BR>
Kate looked into Dirge' eyes, and they held no answer. Her voice was meek,
soft on the surging weather. "Yes, Lila."<BR>
<BR>
A harsh laugh escaped before the shutters were barred from the inside. The
light in the spire went out. Kate felt the laughter again, although there
was only the wind speaking with the dropping leaves. The evening was descending
like a veil. She walked slowly toward the stairs down to the Commune, dragging
her feet through the swirling caravan of the fallen leaves, oblivious. The
moon was gone that eve, and the light would fail by the next strike.</I>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<IMG WIDTH="510" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="Middle" BORDER="0" SRC="bar.gif">
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Her coffee tresses rode the gust back over her shoulders. They white-capped
in fawn, like a springing deer. Yet Rianna bent as gracefully as a willow,
into the wind, her face reflecting moon and the call of the wild. She spoke
into the wind, into the rush of dying leaves, shaking on the trees. Kate
couldn't hear a word she said. She just watched her only friend, impervious
to the elements. How she longed to be like her, so brave. Soon, he would
chide her. Patience...<BR>
<BR>
"...You spend too much time thinking, Kate." Rianna turned, let the wind
swing the shutters shut with a thump, and continued with her advice. "You
need to live a little. What do you have to finish here? Your fount is beautiful.
You'll pass the Ritual. What do you have to worry about?"<BR>
<BR>
Kate knew there were already lines creasing her face. Frown lines. Rianna's
face was so natural, so alive. Her eyes were bright green like the first
ferns of spring. Kate's were dark, dulled brown under untrimmed bangs. Her
fount was beautiful. The ebony caught her eyes when they were closed. It
wasn't precisely burned, though. When she first saw the language of the Art,
those letters were burned into her mind. She would close her eyes and feel
the smoke welling up, the acidic fumes of magick that coursed through her
body, close to the surface, yet untouchable. The fount was just a longing,
like a hole. It was the shadow of a need, almost formed. She could feel it,
see it, but couldn't name it. It was too dark.<BR>
<BR>
"I can't slack off now. I'm so close--"<BR>
<BR>
Rianna sighed loudly. "You've made it, Sister Kate. You've made it. The Ritual
is just a formality, ceremonial ." Rianna ran her fingers back through her
hair, pulling a snarl free. Kate felt her tension, the sense of futility
she felt when dealing with Kate's domestic rooting. Kate wanted to tell her
so badly. It isn't just ceremony. It is power. It's my dream, my time. But
it was just another lecture, another rationale for hours of fading away.<BR>
<BR>
Kate shook her head and though of Him. He had something else in mind. No,
she had something else in mind. He was her tool. He was simply her blade.
"It's dangerous."<BR>
<BR>
"Dangerous? You've been seeing someone I don't know about?" Kate's smile
broke. "I know..." Rianna smiled slyly. She was building up. It reminded
Kate of the way Lila always spoke to her, like she was confiding her Name
to her. Kate wished she had. She'd hold Lila's stained sigil to the force
of the anima, bending, bending--<BR>
<BR>
"A swordsman, perhaps? Some rake from the House Knights?" Rianna was purring
like a sabre-tooth. "A horrendous fiend from the deepest pits? Oh, that would
suit you, Kate. Nothing but the best for Sister Kate!"<BR>
<BR>
Rianna's sharp laughter grated against the loft. He was on her tongue like
a spell. She was ready to dive into the room, shake an apology from Rianna.
Rianna would be awed. She had to be awed before him.<BR>
<BR>
"Rianna, I'm just tired of all this. Isn't there some quiet path where I
could be alone, sleep, dream of--"<BR>
<BR>
"Your daemon-lover?"<BR>
<BR>
Kate chuckled. Her daemon-lover... Her Dirge under the bears' shine, arms
thicker than her waist. Dirge was the shadow, the hole in her life. With
the power would come release and pleasure. All good things must die, he had
laughed. All the better would wait for Kate to step into the circle and--Kate
pulled her thoughts back to Rianna.<BR>
<BR>
"When was the last time you had something to eat, you bad girl?" Rianna looked
at Kate's thin arms through the coarseness of her homespun.<BR>
<BR>
Kate couldn't remember. With the thought of food she was suddenly famished.
"Dinner sounds nice."<BR>
<BR>
They walked out single file, Rianna springing from the sill like a bow from
an arrow, Kate drifting after, her pale hands pulling the dull bronze knob
shut with a creak of protest. She heard the shutters banging again. She'd
forgot to latch them. She was forgetting everything as the Ritual approached.
Had she eaten breakfast? Yesterday? She remembered eggs, but that had been
so long ago. Her father broke them open over the cast iron. They sizzled.
She smelled the bacon. But that wasn't her life. She didn't milk farm animals.
Her life was a rise and set with the fount and visions of freedom in between.
The Rollo plains were long ago, the fount so near.</I>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<IMG WIDTH="510" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="Middle" BORDER="0" SRC="bar.gif">
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Kate felt very hollow, very pained. She'd just missed dinner. There was
a strict rule of punctuality at the Covenant. The only reason she'd missed
the second bell was because she'd been at work on the fount, her special
project as a Keeper. The other girls wouldn't be impressed with the gleaming
onyx, the jet carvings, and the angel's breath of wrought silver. Oh, they
would nod and whisper "admiration," but they would only be noting that Kate
had no escort for the Ritual. She was alone among the three dozen initiates
in that respect. Most of the novices were recruited from Velf, the "valley"
elves. Though they always were freed from the Nygrua addiction, it marred
them deeply. They were a flightly, chaotic people, even without the drug,
prone to intense passions.<BR>
<BR>
Her hands were cold and shaking. She couldn't wait for the Ritual. It had
been ten long years of study and waiting. Such a steep price to pay... Kate's
pride had suffered enormously. Lila had offered to find some "arm-piece"
for Kate, but she had to decline. The Ritual would be her reward... when
the others fell to the Test. But even Rianna was supposed to have someone.
Kate had no one.<BR>
<BR>
Everything was in place. Her hair was loose for the first time since her
binding. The dusky locks fell over her narrow shoulders. Her eyes flashed
a vivid blue, sparkling to match her beryl amulets and steel quartz rings.
The silver had been her mother'. It was her only inheritance. She hardly
thought of her two brothers anymore. Part of her felt guilty because she
did not miss them and knew they would only feel ignorant pride with her
accomplishments this night. They could never understand the faith it took.<BR>
<BR>
Outside, where the bonfires crackled and an owl screeched like clockwork,
the eleventh strike shook her room. The others were already assembled in
the commune casting the rede and triple checking the stars. Kate still had
business to attend to.<BR>
<BR>
She paced her room, carefully skirting Lila's side as if the glyphs of warding
were set. She closed the door slowly. Each inch was satisfied by a protesting
squeal of rusted hinges. She reached outward or inward. She was never quite
sure which direction the pull came from.<BR>
<BR>
Kate's senses wavered, changed.<BR>
<BR>
The stone walls, the nicked rafters that held the loft, the chess, the bureaus,
the few grimoires... they all magnified in her vision. Each speck of dust
assaulted her. The cracks in the bindings of Kate's books cut into her brow,
her heart. The silence roared.<BR>
<BR>
Her awareness was dwarfed by the ever-present coalescing power of the Anima.
She was dutifully patient with the swirling energy. Psychic tendrils snaked
around the Name she sought. Calling, she pulled the vague sigil into an intense
and dark aura, entirely blocking the reality of the room. Pain lanced her
temples and she fought the vertigo of the spirit wrack. She heard voices...
"We are but pawns..." and "alone, I read, an exile by choice-not-choice."
They came from within her. Ghosts, perhaps. Pervious lives. As the world
settled, she opened her eyes.<BR>
<BR>
He had answered.<BR>
<BR>
Dirge towered before her, stooping slightly to avoid the rafters and her
loft. A rebellious corner of her quilt dangled against the purple cloak that
wrapped his lightless body. The patchwork brushed silvery runes, sigils,
wards from the Lost Years. Kate was sure she'd seen them yet couldn't remember
where or when. Something drove an irrational chuckle from her throat, which
she struggled to catch before it clawed its way out. She was unsuccessful.
Something was far too funny. His hood had not parted to reveal those eyes--"never
look into the dragon's eyes," a voice came--but she could feel his brows
furrow in puzzlement.<BR>
<BR>
His soft baritone streamed from where, she presumed, his unseen mouth was.
"Am I so amusing tonight?'<BR>
<BR>
"You were not so amusing last night. Where were you?" She was blunt in her
address. She could afford to be. Kate held Dirge's True Name in her mind.
If he harmed her, he would be without defense. Still, she worried, and her
confident voice hinted of a desperate bluff.<BR>
<BR>
He brought wicked, clawed hands up in a gesture of dismay. Each talon gleamed
like a ground sword blade in the candle light, curved like an Eastern dagger.
"My dear, ye know how I must conspire."<BR>
<BR>
"Conspire? I know, and you must know how much this means to me." Kate was
careful to not say you. It seemed in the core of her mind that this event
was ordained by some greater plot, larger than her unremarkable years, toil
or no, by some genius poet with the moon as a candle.<BR>
<BR>
His shoulders slumped ever so slightly, bringing his mass like a carapace
over her. His shoulders looked to be twice the width of the doorway. His
bulk was masculinity personified. She wanted his arms around her... but that
would wait. This was business. This was power. "Ye'll break the Circle, then?"
he asked, more out of a lack for conversation than of doubt.<BR>
<BR>
"I will. You'll do you part, I trust..."<BR>
<BR>
He nodded. "Ye have my Word."</I>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<IMG WIDTH="510" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="Middle" BORDER="0" SRC="bar.gif">
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She longed for Rianna's jeering again, just for this last day. The sun
hid behind the slowly spinning clouds. She heard the bay, in the distance,
a dull roar, its continual battle with the shore. But the shore never gave
in. The powerful, drowning washes of foaming blue salt-laced water thundered
into the sands and raced over the pebbles, polishing their bright, banded
tones. Then it fell back again, slinking into the sea for another approach.<BR>
<BR>
She had been their once, be couldn't recall when. It was so long ago, she
thought. It must have been some place her father took her. It wasn't far
from the Covenant. Rianna often return with gifts of shells and once, even,
a live crab.<BR>
<BR>
Kate had placed the thing into one of the shallow pools in the garden, but
it had slowed, turning pale blue, and eventually stopped moving altogether.
He had said you couldn't take a salt-water creature to the fresh water springs.
They were used to the salt and missed it when it was denied them. Creatures
flourish in sin, he chuckled.<BR>
<BR>
The noon bell rang. She dabbed at the fount one last time. Kate stood back
and looked it up and down. The spirals of silver were free of tarnish. The
black stone was shining like fire, even in the dullness of the overcast day.
How would it look in the Circle? Would it go pale and die like the crab in
the garden? She laughed at the thought.<BR>
<BR>
The fount was timeless. The world was a complement to it. It didn't live
in the world; The world lived around it. The lunch bell rang again, but Kate
ignored it. She wasn't hungry. She stood under the threatening clouds, impatient
and crackling with hope. The fount was a bright hole in the dull afternoon.
It was like an eclipse, the moon blocking the sun--a dark moon, and a less
than bright sun.</I>

<I>The witchlight lit blue the night and the white-hot flames kept by the
bound hearth spirits instilled an artificial warmth on the Hallow's Eve.
Above, the full moon shed Her tears, a faint tribute to fallen Lord Dismal
and exiled Daevin. Kate was resplendent in white, for once exhibiting shyness
jailed charms that snagged the stars of Lila's suitor, whatever his name
was.<BR>
<BR>
Three dozen in all stood in rank with only Rianna before Kate. Sister Wren,
Sister Amylene, three others, stood at the points of the pentagram. Their
faces were a studious blank, their focus on weaving the Anima in the Circle.
This ceremony, the Ritual of Passage, was a rare event. Many would die, and
many more after that, but all for the better.<BR>
<BR>
Kate knew the time was right. Some internal clock told her in fine by mysterious
increments. She Called... The Anima folded to her wishes. Ponderously, the
fount in its dark splendor, floated over the heads of he girls and into the
center of the Circle--resting ever so softly, so soundlessly. It was her
right. She was the Keeper. She called again.<BR>
<BR>
The Elders bent under the blow. They had not expected Kate--quiet, little,
mousy Kate--to call so great an entity from so low a plane.
"dr'Shivreheldespaire, the one called 'Dirge', Lord of Blackmoon, I call
thee!" Her voice was loud, but not shrill. Dirge came. Talons of platinum
gripped his cloak closed. With his arms crossed he looked superb, the Preceptor
of Darkness with a sword as swift...<BR>
<BR>
Rianna stepped forward, leaving her stoic suitor behind. He crossed his arms
in defiance of Dirge, mocking. He was no warlock. His hair was pulled back
into the warrior's braid. He could not respect the risk or the power. He
was, without a doubt, one of the base sort. Rianna stepped into the Circle,
her lanky body appearing skeletal before the Daemon's. Yet she carried herself
with confidence, contempt. In that, she was very like her suitor. A tree
trunk arm stretched out a single claw and drew a fine bead of blood from
her skyward palm. Dirge observed it, handing on his finger tip, as if it
were a priceless treasure, then brought it within the folds of his hood...<BR>
<BR>
A shimmer danced over the girls, flinging the dead leaves towards the clear
night, shaking more leaves from the disrobing trees. The five elders trembled
under the fore. The glow faded into the shadowed recesses of the courtyard,
brooding. She was worthy. She was alive.<BR>
<BR>
That did surprise Kate. Rianna avoided the others, slipping off into the
woods, sometimes vanishing for a season, only to return for the Tests. She
always passed and, in ways, excelled Kate. Yet the summoning was Kate's privilege
because Rianna had been in the Covenant for far less time and would not take
certain vows. Kate was the Keeper. Rianna rejoined her suitor who was fingering
the hilt of his sword.<BR>
<BR>
Kate was the last to enter the Circle. That was a penalty for her singleness.
Six girls remained intact. the others had not been deemed deserving of the
shimmer and of Passing. Cold, ebon flames had claimed them, escorting their
sordid, stained souls to Dirge's unspeakable home; Lila had been among those
who screamed. Oddly, Kate watched with disinterest. She had dreamed this
so many times before, when the others were laughing, dodging their studies,
the Ritual was almost anti-climactic. Maybe that was because the doomed would
not realize Kate was any better, any more deserving. They would never know.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, Katherine took three brave strides forward. It was like the theater...
Some part of her felt as if she were acting a character very unlike the actress.
Her palms were not shown for the Moon's gaze or His touch. She broke the
Circle.<BR>
<BR>
Those present saw the iron bar drop, unable to halt it. The Elders were trapped
in the Circle. To halt the girl, they would fall to the creature of the nether.
The new witches tried, but Kate's Anima deflected all their shieldings, drawing
on some distant power. A wave of utter agony crushed the breath from all
save Him. He stretched out his sickle hands and reaped. The swirling enigmatic
hearth spirits wrapped flickering limbs of fire around each girl, each sister,
save Rianna and her friend who fought silently, grimly. The caught descended
through a swirling black portal--forever slaves of the place called the Hel
of the Isles.<BR>
<BR>
Kate looked into his deep, beautiful eyes as his hood fell back. He smiled.
Around him, the leaves spun into tiny helixes of death fury, catching fire
from their vigorous course. Rianna and hers had fled, slipping through the
Anima and eluded him. "Well, my lady, you've sought and won, no?"<BR>
<BR>
She shook her head no. Her victory required one more touch--his touch. "Kiss
me."<BR>
<BR>
He too, signaled no. His expression turned grim, his lips rising like a wolf's,
letting canines peek through. "Ye, my dearest," he intoned, "do not order
me. Ye..."<BR>
<BR>
He paused, watching the panic shake her. Her eyes grew wide and awareness
dawned. Dirge could see her feeble human mind screaming betrayal. He nodded.
He let her reach his sigil and try to focus, but she simply had too little
strength. "Ye didn't pass the Ritual," he finished.<BR>
<BR>
Kate had forgotten.<BR>
<BR>
He chuckled in the courtyard, his baritone becoming as harsh as the unpolished
stone, a jewel in the midst of charcoal. The leaves spun around, glowing
like embers, then falling to ashes--there plight spent. "Silly girl, my dear.
Ye'll be a divine vassal." And all was silent save a recently abandoned fount,
charred and forgotten, which was crackling with the heat of the dying flames.
The full moon's light poured down in a torrent.<BR>
<BR>
Far from the Covenant's walls, far into the wild lands of gnarled trees and
vines and large, hazel eyes, Rianna held her bow and eluded her suitor. She
shot an arrow at the moon, watching it descend among the blood red leaves.</I>
