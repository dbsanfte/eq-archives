<I>The scribe quickly deposited his coins in his pocket and took the proffered
scroll. He ran outwards across the plains to the House of Winterborne, and
unfurled the scroll to read the neat handwriting. Announcing himself at the
door, he was sent to the scribe's office. Clearing his throat on his arrival
there, he summoned up his deepest voice and announced to the clerk in
the...</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>" Let it be known by all of House Winterborne that Lord Amabala Amles
of Knights Valorous has asked for the hand of Lady Trespare of Winterborne
in companionship and Holy marriage. May all take note and consider themselves
invited to the grand proceedings. A date shall be set shortly."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Bowing deeply to those present, the page smoothed out the scroll and pressed
it into the hands of the House Scribe. "From the Lady Trespare of Winterborne
to her House, may you scribe it as thus, per her directions." &nbsp;Stumbling
slightly, the young boy ran from the Guildhouse, amazed that he had been
paid so well for such a small thing, and vowing to stay near the Lady who
was so free with her coin. </I>

<I>Flutrose stopped sipping her honey mead, and it was only with the greatest
self control that she stifled a gasp at the young herald's words. Confusion
ran through her mind. Lady Trespare, engaged to another? Did she not already
have a chosen mate?</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She grabbed Saidaar's hand and pulled him out into a secluded alley. "Saidaar,
what happened to Erondis and Trespare?" Saidaar sipped the wine he had carried
out and carefully considered his reply. "My love, they have parted ways."
Flutrose was now thoroughly confused. "Parted ways? When did this happen?"
Saidaar shrugged and replied. "I do not know exactly when it happened, but
Trespare spoke to me about it at least a week ago, perhaps even longer than
that." Flutrose lightly chewed her lower lip, lost in thought. She had been
so concerned about her own affairs and happiness that she had lost track
of what was happening in her House. Worry washed over her. "Sweetest, please
tell me. How did Trespare take this parting?" Saidaar smiled and lightly
rubbed her cheek. "Do not worry my dearest Rose, she seemed resigned to their
parting. Erondis has little mind left. She is better off without him." He
leaned over and kissed his betrothed. "Enough of these matters. Let us leave
and await Rhy and Ronne so that we may get our Hearts of Stone for our boots."
He slipped his arm around her and kissed her again. Flutrose smiled at him,
all thoughts of Trespare and Erondis gone from her mind.<BR>
<BR>
After bidding Saidaar good night, Flutrose sat in her room at the Jade Tiger
Inn and removed a slightly crumpled, but clean, piece of parchment from her
backpack. She sharped a quill, dipped it in ink, and began to write a
message.<BR>
<BR>
"My Sister Trespare, may I extend both my congratulations and happiness at
your upcoming nuptials. I have not yet had the pleasure to meet thy Lord
Amabala, but hope to soon have the pleasure of doing so. Though I am busy
planning both my own wedding and assisting Rhy with hers, I would be happy
and honored to offer ye any assistance ye might need. Indeed, it might be
a good idea if the two of us can sit down and have a talk, to help insure
that neither of us neglects anything in our plans. I am so verra happy for
thee! Signed, Flutrose"<BR>
<BR>
Flutrose folded the parchment and tipped her candle over it, spilling wax
upon the open end. She centered her seal and carefully pressed, then removed
the seal and lightly waved the scroll to cool the wax. She rang a small bell
and summoned a page. Depositing ten platinum pieces into his outstretched
hand, she instructed the lad to seek out Trespare in the Karanas. He grinned
and quickly deposited the coins within the folds of his waist pouch as he
walked out of the room. <BR>
<BR>
Flutrose blew out her candle, changed into a silk tunic, then crawled into
bed. Her last thought before drifting off to sleep was that of wondering
if perhaps a potential cure she may have discovered for the malfunctions
would work...</I>

<I>Lady Trespare sipped a bit of her bottle of Kalish and wiped the sweat
off her brow. The sticky humid heat of the Karana plains was legendary. Taking
a quick break from scouting the hillside known as 'Reaver Hill', she worked
to quickly bind her wounds, and rest before attempting to once again gain
access to the Reaver Totem at the top. The danger of this spot was legendary
throughtout the realms, and by proving she could gain the top and touch the
totem, she could prove she was worthy for her next rank. The test of skill
had come from her Plains master, and she was bound to do it. He did however,
tell her that if she were able to reach it in the dark, he would offer her
more specialized training in the arts of wielding 2 weapons at once. Because
the crest was doubly dangerous in the dark, and the addition of undead increased
the risk, she swept away her fatigue, and stood to make another run towards
the top. A small voice issued from her side just as she was about to grip
her weapon and charge upwards.<BR>
"Lady, Lady.." A small quick hand withdrew from her money pouch as she whirled
to face the intruder. The young halfling, teeth wide in a smile, threw his
hands up and hurridly explained, " Lady, a missive has come for thee. I,
I..oh dear.." his voice trailed off at the look of amazement on her face.
</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Are you mad? What could cause you to put yourself so far from the path
in search of me? Do ye not know this is a dangerous spot?" Trespare's voice
carried the weight of concern for the youngling. Grabbing him up by the scruff
of his neck she hauled him down into her small blind behind a screen of trees
and held out her hand. Giving her a quick grin, the halfling produced the
scroll with an elegant flourish and slapped it into her palm. " I nae know
how to get thee safely out of here with night falling. Ye must stay down!"
Tucking the scroll into her belt pouch, she tried to explain the precariousness
of the situation to the small boy.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Oh, I gots a little trick Lady, no worries! I was paid well! Me go now,
hop hop!" giving her another quick grin, he twisted a small ring on his right
index finger and faded from view in a soft whisper of magic.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Muttering about the too happy page, Tres decided to sit down and read
the missive now, and wait for full dark. Mayhaps she could get to the top
this eve. Unrolling it and scanning it quickly, she pulled out her own quill
and penned a response directly below with small flowing letters.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>'Lady Flutrose, I thank ye for your well wishes. I know many of House
Winterborne are wondering what has become of me lately and how I came to
such a thing in light of my previous relationship with Lord Erondis. I can
hear such in your words. Let me take now the time to explain to ye what has
occured. After the meeting with Lord Master Dirge in his office, and upon
finding that Lord Erondis was an animation, we adjourned to the Lion's Mane
Inn to discuss the matter between Erondis and myself. Lord Erondis was of
the conclusion that he could nae hold me as his mate in light of such a
revelation, and that he must prepare to depart for some moons to find his
own truth. I was saddened by this, and related to him that I nae cared whether
he was sick or ill, that I had love for him, and would assist him in his
search. During the course of our converstation, long as it was, we bickered
back and forth over our mating and our future. In the end, Lord Erondis claimed
to need his time alone, and did nae wish to subject me to the kind of long,
painful disease that he was suffering of. Because of his love for me, and
mine for him, we deigned to follow our own paths forward then, so that each
of us may be content unto our souls. I kept the news to myself for some time,
as the loss of him struck me deeply. We both wished time to heal and find
answers before we announced our parting. I hold nothing but respect and fondness
for him in my heart. We decided, as we must, this separation of our mating,
with a heavy heart and no bad feeling. I wish only the best for Lord Erondis,
as I know he does for me. I have nae spoken to him in some time now, and
I worry for him. I had hoped that I may inquire of you if he is well, as
ye may have seen him where I have not. I hope he is safe. In any event, I
accept thy good wishes and will endevor to speak to ye about the arrangements.
I have been greatly blessed by meeting Lord Amabala Amles, and have found
his fellow knights to be of good character and great honor. I have come to
love him over the course of these many weeks, and have seen his love and
respect for me in his actions and words. Truly I could ask for no one better.
I was pleasantly surprised when he honored me by asking for my hand, and
found in my heart the answer. I shall be arriving in Qeynos within the week,
and would love to meet thee if ye have time. Mayhaps I can then introduce
thee to Lord Amles. I am sure you will find him to be as noble and unselfish
as I do. My thoughts go with ye.'<BR>

Summoning the bits of magic she needed, Tres rolled up the scroll and tucked
it wihin the magic portal she had willed. It would speed across the etherlands
to Lady Flutrose in due time. That done, Lady Tres took a deep breath and
grabbed the hilt of her sword once again. </I>
