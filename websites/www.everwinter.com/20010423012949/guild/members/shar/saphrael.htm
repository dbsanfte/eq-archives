	    <TD><I>The sharp rap on the door was followed by laughter and whispering.
	      Dirge looked at the MECHronometer on the hearth, one of the few items he
	      had brought from his Spire. "Punctual as ever," he said in a deep voice and
	      arose to meet his callers. He was growing accustomed to the nondescript human
	      form, the feel of leather armor and the fitness his dark elven seeming lacked.
	      Old beyond ages, there was a real delight in rising without the aches, pains,
	      and reminders of that decline.</I></TD>

	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Standing at the door was a grizzled looking barbarian, missing an eye
	and too brazen to wear an eye-patch. He was adorned in banded with a few
	scraps of animal hide and clenched a powerful bone-hilted blade. "Hey, ya
	Pops!" the over-sized human said. The gruffness of his voice belied a kind
	streak in the mercenary.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Dirge wasn't surprised to see that Tanner's seeming on Norrath was that
	of a barbarian. It seemed very appropriate. "Tanner, welcome. Where is the
	beautiful lady Saphrael?" Tanner's bemused smile was accompanied by a slight
	tug on the druid's trousers. He looked down to find a very young female gnome
	with flaxen blonde hair and keen amethyst eyes. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Saphrael smiled up at him and warned, "Careful with the short jokes alright?
	I've had just about all I can take from this guy." She elbowed Tanner sharply
	in the shin. Not unexpectedly, he was oblivious to the impact and continued
	to shout.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"Hah! Dontcha love it? We kicked the pants off a few beetles on our way
	here already. Saph's quite a looker as far as the gnomes around here go.
	Ya know, she doesn't have one of those big noses. And she's got a heck of
	an arm on her to boot. We're gonna get along just fine here." Tanner's broad
	grin could be described as terrifying to those who didn't know him.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Dirge stood aside, allowing the two to enter his abode, all the while
	watching Saphrael's expression changing. He showed them to a sitting room
	that doubled as his office. A modest desk sat near a window, overflowing
	with paperwork already. The room he had rented at the Ironforge estate was
	a bit modest, spartan of decoration and had the feel of transience. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"Ya know, you really need a secretary, old man."</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Dirge smiled and sighed. "Aye, I know. My wants are many since I've returned
	to Norrath. Someone to take care of my busy work is still among them. Would
	either of ye care for a drink?" He didn't mention he had two bottles of red
	wine and some rancid stuff called Ogre Swill by the locals.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Saphrael smiled, her amethyst eyes gleaming with a pixie heritage. "Oh,
	we thought you'd like to join us in a drink of this." She swung off her backpack
	and pulled a bottle from it. Dirge grinned broadly as he recognized his favorite
	dark elven wine, Alurlyath. Much to his delight, Saphrael pulled out two
	more bottles.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"Oh, ye thought correctly, my dear. I can't seem to keep enough of this
	stocked." As he poured himself and Saphrael a glass of the wine, Tanner cracked
	open a hand keg of Brokenblade home brew - a strange concoction best described
	as hard cider with a hint of pear.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Dirge continued. "So, tell me Saphrael, how does Norrath find ye? I trust
	ye have most of your abilities. Spell casting seems to be so important in
	this land. Most of the ranks in Winterborne function as spell casters in
	some way. It is one of the reasons I summoned ye. We have very few mercenaries
	in our ranks, veterans as it were."</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"I haven't been here long enough to tell. And I don't have any spell books.
	If I find one with the appropriate spells, I will study it to see if I can
	memorize them. But I feel the magic essence has subsided since I've arrived
	here. It troubled me at first. You of all people know of the painstaking
	time I put into researching and honing the spells I used. They were invaluable
	to me on Toril. But I feel confident enough in my fighting abilities. No
	matter how much time I spent researching, I was always careful to continue
	my training as a fighter." Saphrael took a sip of the glowing wine.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"We've met a few members of the guild already, by the way. Saidar, I remember
	meeting him once in NeverWinter and again on the Isles, I believe. He had
	one of his people deliver some armor and other magic items to me before Kerilar
	brought me to Qeynos."</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Tanner took a long draw from his hand keg and said, "Yeah, and I met a
	guy named Morphite. Shar and that fellow helped me get through the gnoll
	caverns out there in the hills. I was there before, a few months back when
	I was scouting out this place for ya."</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>The three continued on for some time - chatting, catching up on news,
	and getting briefed on the particulars of Norrath. After a bottle and a half
	of Alurlyath, Saphrael noticed the sun rising. "Well, we should be going.
	I'm interested in seeing the lay of the land for myself. I've seen the maps
	and ran quickly with Kerilar across a large portion of plains, but it was
	all such a blur. I'm looking forward to joining you in the field once again,
	Dhuri--Dirge, rather. You know, name changes are the hardest things to get
	used to." She laughed, her dulcet voice lifting Dirge's melancholy spirits
	for a bit. She hugged him, an awkward little hug, as he was still sitting
	and she standing. "Don't worry. It may take us some time, but we'll solve
	this thing." </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Dirge didn't comment, but having the assistance of Saphrael and Tanner
	would go a long way towards solidifying the ranks of Winterborne. </I>
