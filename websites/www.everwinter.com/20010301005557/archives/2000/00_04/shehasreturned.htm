<I>Balkin crouched in the corner of the Tower in Crushbone... waiting. The
new Emperor Crush or possibly Ambassador Dvinn would be along shortly...
The thought brought a twitch, that might have been confused with a smile,
to the scarred warriors lips. His blade was dry of blood, and needed wetting!
How better than to bury the two handed sword to the hilt in Crush's chest?
or to skewer Dvinn as if he were on a spit? It was to no avail though...
However he tried to focus on what was to come, he found his thoughts drifting
off to the news he had received that day.<BR>
<BR>
He had been at a merchant in the Tree city of the Wood Elves, selling the
armor and weapons he had taken from the hated Orcs of Crushbone, when the
runner had approached. The blade of Balkin's "Langseax of the Wolves" whipped
to the side an pointing at the young humans navel had stopped him well beyond
arms reach... The steel of the sword, and the hard look in the armored dwarves
eyes, causing the runner to gulp and go pale, but he held his ground. "Don't
run at me boy, not if ye value yer hide. I been battling much lately, and
be a bit jumpy from all the excitment..." <BR>
<BR>
Balkin was impressed, the human boy stayed where he was, and sighed as he
wiped his brow, "Are ye Balkin Ironfist? of house Winterborne?" "Aye lad,
ye are a messenger yes? Ye have something for me?" "Yes sir, tis a missive
from Lady Trespare, though she is using the name Rianna for some reason."
Balkin gave a start, then narrowed his eyes dangerously. "Aye then boy, give
it to me then, and wait here a moment".<BR>
<BR>
Balkin stepped to the side. Placing it point down into the wood of the platform,
he leaned his forearms on the guard of his 2 handed sword. Slowly he unrolled
the scroll, reading as he went. "I have come" was at the top. Rianna... The
queen was here! She had come! Dhirge had spoken of her before, of her great
power and leadership. <BR>
<BR>
A premonition, flowed through Balkin, causing his hackles to rise, and the
hair on his arms to stand on end... A cold rush passed through his body as
his mind drifted into the unknown. Something was going to happen, and soon.
What it was, he did not know, but he best be prepared for it... Quickly,
he scanned the rest of the message. <BR>
<BR>
Rianna had taken over Lady Trespare's body! She knew he intended to go to
Unrest with Lady Zsalshun soon. She wished to join them. To get to know them
both. To meet this queen he had heard so much of... He felt himself getting
mean and defensive already. Eyes narrowing, as he quickly rolled up the scroll,
he turned his head to glare at the human boy. In a hard voice he asked, "Ye
have any idea what this says boy?" The boy, a child really, stood straighter
and lifted his chin. "No sir, I do not delve into that which is not my business,
I am a runner, and bound to keep my oath of privacy." Inward, Balkin sighed,
his wrath was not directed at this boy... "Aye then lad, take these," the
dwarf said as he dumped several Platinum into the boys small hand. "Rest,
in the inn there a bit, I will pen a reply when I am done here." The boy
grinned widely as he headed into the inn for a meal and a
drink.<BR>
<BR>
Thoughts whirling, Balkin quickly finished his dealing with the impatient
merchant, then went to the bank to deposit his coin, an the beautiful Dwarven
Ringmail Tunic He had taken from the still warm corpse of Old Emperor Crush
just a short while ago. <BR>
<BR>
What was it that had his hackles up? Was it that this ancient soul, from
another world had taken the body of his friend? What had happened to Trespare?
Was she still there in her body? Sharing it with the queen? Did her soul
still exist? or was she forever destroyed by this possesion? Balkin caught
himself rubbing the scar that cut diagonally up through his beard, over the
bridge of his nose, and between his eyes again. He alwasy did that when he
got truely aggitated. Growling quietly, he headed out of the bank.<BR>
<BR>
The boy rose from his table as Balkin strode into the inn, but the dwarf
waved him back to his seat. Approaching the Innkeeper, he quietly asked for
a piece of parchment and an ink pot, then, removing his helm and gauntlets,
he sat in a quiet corner to pen his reply.<BR>
<BR>
Puzzling over how to address her, "My queen?" "My Lady?", he finally got
angry at himself and thus was blunt. Grinning hard, he even overcame the
spitefull urge to use dwarven runes. Instead, he laughed quietly as he began
his resonse, appropriately, in dragon... <BR>
<BR>
"Rianna, ye are welcome to join meself and Zsalshun on our journey to Unrest.
There be many foul undead there, and though ye are unused to "your" new body,
yer blade and magic would be of assistance. If ye happen upon Lady Amorsalynn,
Lady Sharhel, or one of the Troll Warrior brothers Krudd or Chudd, bring
them along. Me thinks there be plenty to keep us busy in that haunted place,
yes?"<BR>
<BR>
Quickly he signed the missive, and using a bit of sand to dry the ink, and
some wax, he pressed the seal of his Jagged band ring onto the piece of
parchment. Sighing to himself, he headed across the room to the human boy,
who stood as the dwarf approached.<BR>
<BR>
"Here boy, ye give this to Rianna, ye hear?" A slight narrowing of his eyes
drove home his next statement, "Do nae be calling her Trespare anymore, got
me? She will nae be using that name much longer anyway." The boy was obviously
puzzled, but nodded. "Rest a bit more, then get ye gone on yer journey, yes?"
As he silently slipped the missive into his couriers pouch the boy replied,
"Yes My Lord Balkin, as you say, I will be only a few minutes more. Then
I will be away!" With a jerk, Balkin pulled his gauntlets back on. "Aye then,
ye are a good lad, safe journey to you."<BR>
<BR>
Turning on his heal, Balkin strode out of the inn and toward the lift, it
was time to return to Crushbone, and work out his fury on the bodies of those
foul orcs... Aye, they should have chosen a new leader by now, A "New" Emperor
Crush. The grin that spread across his scared face, as he buckled on his
helmet, could have only been referred to as vindictive, and evil. Chuckling,
he stepped onto the lift. Only a few more minutes.<BR>
<BR>
With a start, and a great deal of pain, Balkin snapped out of his revery,
only to see the newly chosen Emperor Crush raise his bronze 2 handed sword
back for another slash at him. That HURT!!! Wish a scream of rage and hate,
Balkin dove between the huge orcs legs, striking into the thigh with his
sword as he rolled to his feet. The big oaf turned around, his blade whistling
to cut the dwarf in two. Ducking under the swing, Balkin struck back hard,
scoring two hard blows in rapid succession on the now confused Emperor. Aye,
the new Emperor could fight, but he would prove not up to the task, just
like the one before him. They danced around each other for a couple minutes,
trading blows, and taking damage, until finally, the orc made a mistake.
Yelling a Dwarven battle cry, Balkin slammed his sword into Emperor Crush's
chest, through his body, and into the wall behind. He could feel the orc's
heart, as it beat against the blade, lacerating itself. The orc dropped his
sword, and clawed weakly at the sword in his chest. <BR>
<BR>
Balkin looked deep into the dying orcs eyes, as he yanked the 2 handed sword
out of the near dead orcs chest. The Emperor slowly slid down the wall to
a sitting position, still looking into the eyes of his nemesis, a heavily
armored dwarf. As the light faded in those piggish eyes, Balkin said one
word, clearly, and loud enough to be heard, even on the ground below the
tower. He watched as the light faded in those eyes, and simply said "Die".</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin crouched under the tree, high on the hill, overlooking the entrance
to the Dwarven city of Kaladim. The rain was sheeting down, causing even
the great bonfires near the tremendous statue of an anciend Dwarven King,
to sputter in the night. From his perch, he could see the young dwarves scurrying
about, working diligently, as he once had, to remove the snakes, bats, skeletons,
and young goblins from the area around the gates of the city, that travelers
might be safe.<BR>
<BR>
Much troubled him, and the frown on his face would have caused most to back
up and leave him alone, had anyone the presence of mind, to look upon the
hill, and see him there, crouched in the rain. What was he to do? <BR>
<BR>
The aflictions that troubled the Winterborne seemed uncurable, though the
house worked diligently, if in an unfocused manor, towards finding a cure.
It seemed hopeless to this dwarf some days. Lord Dhirge had not been seen
in some time, nor had Sharel for that matter. Lady Zsalshun, and her little
one had disappeared, much was happening, as all tried desperately to find
a cure for those aflicted.<BR>
<BR>
And here he was, out in the rain, because it seemed to fit his mood. There
was little he could do to aid in their efforts. He was a warrior. His strengths
were those of the martial kind, which seemed ill suited for the search for
a cure. His abilities were not called for often by the house. He had many
companions, of one kind or another, but few he saw more than once in a
fortnight.<BR>
<BR>
Nor, had he yet met Lady Rianna/Trespare. He was still deeply troubled by
this transformation. Trespare had been his friend, and he was unsure what
to make of this great dragon who now inhabited her body. Was Trespares soul
gone forever? Did her soul share the flesh it resided in with the soul of
the ancient dragon Rianna? Was it there, but supressed, and screaming into
the darkness, alone? These thoughts troubled him. He had never been called
smart, and he had no answers... this indeed troubled him greatly and, it
made him angry.<BR>
<BR>
The rage came forth again. The burning unfocused fury. His eyes felt hot,
his muscled trembled, his body on fire. With a sudden move, he stood and
screamed his rage and anger into the night. A howl, so blood chilling, the
young dwarves in the small valley below and behind him, and those in front
of the gates, scurried away, most running for the guards at the gate, hoping
for protection from whatever evil predator roamed the hills. He thrust his
Dual swords into the air and roared his rage and anger into the night once
again, then again.... The silence seemed defening. The hills were deserted,
all the young dwarves huddled in the tunnel behind a phalanx of guards come
out to guard the entrance to the city from this unknown enemy.<BR>
<BR>
As the fury subsided into a hot burn in his chest, Balkin turned, and ran
away from the city, into the dark, rainy night, headed for Dagnor's cauldron,
and then to the Ruins of the Estate of Unrest. He had to take out this rage,
before it consumed him. The undead in the estate had a hatred of the living
that rivaled his own unfocused rage.<BR>
<BR>
Beneith the rage and fury he felt, a small ball of fear began to grow. He
was already marked by his own afliction, but was it progressing? Was it not
only his scars, but this berserk fury? Was he slipping into his own madness?
One of rage and hatred? Was that why he could not identify what it was that
caused the burning fury to errupt? Was he turning into a raging berserker,
mindlessly slaying everything he met? If so, it needed to be ended now! He
would not become a danger, not only to the evil in this realm, but to those
of his house, and other good people of Norrath.<BR>
<BR>
He felt the rage coming on again, as he entered the estate, and thankfully,
found something at the entrance to vent his anger, and admittedly, to himself
anyway, his fear on. Shorlty thereafter, he joined a small party of elves
and dwarves there to rid the estate of the undead. Balkin admired their desires,
but he knew, deep down, that the evil that purvaded this place would not
so easily be defeated. The adventurers who died here, their bones would be
animated by the power of this place. There would be no end to the undead.
He felt this, knew this, but kept silent. Let them be deluded. He would kill
what he could, and increase his skills and abilities. Some day, if he didn't
end his life to prevent his madness from overtaking him, he would be needed
by the house. A cure would be found. He held on to this thought, used it
to battle the rage within him, to keep himself calm. He grimaced, as he fought
within himself, but fought on, killing those who were already dead,
again.<BR>
<BR>
The rage subsided, as the night progressed, and he felt almost normal when
he finally left, only to find daylight outside! He had been inside for quite
some time, apparently. He jogged on, back towards Kaladim. He needed to sell
some of the booty he had just taken from the undead, and he needed rest.
He was tired to his very soul. The rage was still there, but supressed.
<BR>
<BR>
The grim smile he wore, as he jogged past the guards at the enterance to
Kaladim was disconcerting, to the youngsters at least. The guards knew him,
knew of his great deads and regarded him warmly, as he passed with a nod.
They would have thought differently, had they known it was him on the hill,
screaming into the night, just a few hours before. Still, it seemed to have
passed for now.</I>
