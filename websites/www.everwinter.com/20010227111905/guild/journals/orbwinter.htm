	<I>Grayson Hennings ordered another ale and leaned against the bar as old
	"Grizz" pulled it from the tap. Looking around, the retired knight saw several
	new patrons waiting for service impatiently. One of them, a dwarf, and obviously
	a warrior was giving him an appraising stare which he broke off when eye
	contact was made. Grayson cocked his head to the side and stared back for
	a moment, seeing the dwarf smile and nod his head in greeting. "Ere ye go,
	mi'laird" Grizz said, and hurried off to serve the new party. </I>
	<P>
	<I>Grayson made his way back to his table in the far corner of the old tavern
	and went back to his paperwork. Writing the story of one's life was not an
	easy task, as he was finding out quickly enough. Barely into the Star Rider
	portion of his life, he was considering how he would describe the falling
	out between himself and Ambergrin the copper dragon that had been both sister
	and mother to him during their time together as Star Riders. Lost in thought,
	he didn't hear the sound of several pairs of feet approaching his table until
	a voice spoke up and broke the ex-knight's thoughts. " Ohnslaught sends his
	greetings, maggot!" the dwarf before him said. Behind him were three humans
	with swords drawn and ready. The dwarf held a wheellock pistol in his hands,
	pointed at Grayson's head.. Before the knight could even reach for his only
	weapon, a dagger that rested on his left hip, the dwarf had fired. The small
	metal ball rammed into his temple and the knight's head dropped to the table.
	</I> <I>"Twenty dead, sir. No sign of who did the work and no witnesses to
	what happened. They might be amateurs out to make a few quick gold pieces,
	since the only experienced warrior in the tavern was yer Grayson. What was
	he to you, if you don't mind me asking, miss Ambergrin?" </I>
	<P>
	<I>The constable asked with a visible curiousity that went well beyond basic
	investigation and bordered into just being nosy, "We fought together for
	awhile, mister Canfert. Nothing else you need to know." she said curtly "If
	that is all you need, then I thank you for your time. Now, tell me where
	Grayson's body is so I can get him away from fat fools like yourself and
	this rathole you live upon!" Taken aback by the tone the woman had taken,
	Constable Canfert walked the woman down to the undertaker's shanty, leaving
	her on the walkway and heading back to his office. Ambergrin knocked three
	times on the door with no answer. </I>
	<P>
	<I>Annoyed at what must be a lazy human avoiding the work his door's knocking
	might bring, she kicked it open and yelled, "Get your..." The ballistae just
	inside the door fired as the rope tied to the door and siege weapon became
	taut, the bolt blasting through the dragon's chest and dropping her to the
	ground. Her last sight was of a dwarf laughing at her as she faded into death.
	"Simple! These Star Riders die way to easily, Dreyfus is a liar. We can clean
	out the stragglers and then finish Valator. He never deserved the signet.
	I did!" </I>
	<P>
	<I>His companion, a sickly thin, ebon-skinned elven woman smiled with contempt
	at the dwarf. "The fool thinks Master Ohnslaught will let him rule Clan Gorin
	over his brother. He thinks there actually be a clan left when this is over,"
	she thought. Out loud she said "Valator has allies we don't yet know of,
	captain. They might prove to be, shall we say, more formidable than these
	Star Rider castoffs we've been killing thus far." </I>

	<P>
	<I>The courier came in running . . . nearly exausted and quite unable to
	speak of her news. Cz waited impatiently as the courier tried to expell the
	information she had. 'Sir,' gasp, 'I have . . .' gasp, 'more news of
	Ohnslaught's,' the courier paused as she searched for words, but finally
	sighed out, 'well... onslaught' </I>
	<P>
	<I>Cz motioned for the underlings scroll and bid his staff take care of the
	courier. "See that he is taken care of and refreshed. Thank you for your
	service young woman." She bowed out and left as Cz opened the scroll. His
	look of contentment left him as he read the contents. Alone now, he read
	the parchement once more aloud, "Ohnslaught has dispatched of two more of
	the Star Riders, my lord. I have done as you bid, but I feel I am being watched.
	I think it would be best that I be reassigned, sir. Your humble servant,
	Lucrious." </I>
	<P>
	<I>Humble? the bronze chuckled. He called to one of his servants, Please
	see to it that Lucrious is . . . reassigned to a safer job, hmm . . . I know,
	the hatchery is in need of a feeder. Please see that Lucrious is safe once
	more. The servant tried not to smirk, and acknowledged the message. So, Lucrious,
	you have uncovered yet more about this Ohnslaught. What is it that he disklikes
	so much about our Star Rider friends? The bronzes voice echoed into the empty
	hall. His thoughts, more retorical than he'd like, fell upon the cold stone
	of the surrounding walls. </I>
	<P>
	<I>Finally, he arose and headed for Shiver's civis. </I>

	<I>&lt;A note delivered to Ohnslaught by Dreyfus, Leader of the Band&gt;
	</I>
	<P>
	<I>Day 100 of intelligence gathering within the Aerie has revealed nothing
	about the stance that the Aerie dragons will take in defense of the Riadaim.
	Thus far, our actions have been fruitless in spreading anti-Riadaim fervor
	among the Chromatic ranks, and since Jaderess went missing our only possible
	contact in decapitating the leadership rests with luring Boarak or Bloodeyes.
	Boarak is too stubborn to reveal ourselves to, as he might feel better served
	by the current regime than taking it over himself. Bloodeyes can be rented
	but not bought, and even then he is unlikely to assassinate Dirge without
	some enormous price. </I>
	<P>
	<I>Riadaim strength has been bolstered with the Aerie but the Adventurers
	of Cormyr and some Steppe Warrior elements. They aren't Star Rider alumni,
	and lack the knowledge of the foe they face, but still are quite wily in
	the least. If you remember, Ogotai, Jagatei, and Sengum slew several of our
	Dread Eldar assassins when we spent the lot of them infiltrating Starlight
	well over a year back. We are a known quality to that group, and their obscene
	amount of luck against many different foes can be used to their advantage
	in a struggle against us. </I>
	<P>
	<I>On another note, a messenger was seen with Cz, that self-absorbed Bronze
	fellow. It seems that he received Riadaim related news, possibly information
	related to the culling of the inactive Star Rider ranks. I am not positive,
	but this one might be trouble. His assault on Sparkis awhile back seemed
	to leave him disillusioned, but Bronze dragons are renowned for their to
	advance into the face of adversity. He might rally the metallics or worse...scour
	the aerie for spies, in which case our Valator doppleganger is in serious
	jeopardy even before being set unto his mission. </I>

	<P>
	<I>Cz walked into Shiver's office quietly. He'd never been one to announce
	himself to his friend. Today was no exception. As he was oft to do, Shiver
	sat with his back to the door. The cold light of the night washed over his
	frail body as Cz's bulk gave him away. </I>
	<P>
	<I>"What is it that bothers you, bronzen one?" Shiver's voice was broken,
	but soft. It was well known the two were friends, but each knew the others
	weaknesses. A match, no doubt, but it wasn't made in Io's heaven. </I>
	<P>
	<I>"It seems," Cz began, "there are some problems within that need to be
	remedied. I thought," Cz stopped. He moved forward and grabbed Shiver's chair
	and spun him around, "at least face me while . . ." Cz stopped. </I>
	<P>
	<I>Shiver's face was moist with old tears. Cz lost his cocky tone and asked
	what was wrong. "Do not bore me with your caring tone here, my friend. Now
	please go on . . ." Shiver half demanded, half pleaded. </I>
	<P>
	<I>Cz sighed and waited to give Shiver a chance to vent. He did not. </I>
	<P>
	<I>Futily, Cz continued, "It seems that the Riadaim have inherited a great
	enemy. A being, a man, an entire force," Cz threw is arms wide, "I do not
	know! It angers me to be so lost from the truth. What I do know is that all
	roads lead here," Cz slammed on Shiver's desk, sending notes and little
	"stickies"(as Shiv called em) flying, "and it does not bode well!" </I>
	<P>
	<I>Shiver sat for a long time. Cz continued to tell him of what he knew,
	answering the few questions he could, well into the night. </I>

	<P>
	<I>The night was approaching All Clans Isle like a tsunami unleashed, and
	the dark elf's mind was awash with the high tides of despair. The waves pounded.
	Friendship was expensive, and not solely for the cost of giving; friendship
	was expensive because of how much it hurt to loose. The waves struck the
	eroded beaches. Surely that was the definition of value. Do ye miss it? he
	would muse, surrounded in the dismal light of dark wood in his chilled office.
	The white-capped monsters ate away. The answer, despite the walls of harsh
	experience, would always be the same--a resounding "Aye!" followed by the
	dull ache of memory. </I>
	<P>
	<I>And so it seeped in, pulling the pebbles of fond recall from his mind's
	shore. He had been aware of Val's plight, peripherally. Out of the corner
	of his thoughts, he had caught alarm and anger from the distant dwaven warrior.
	Grax Gorin was in trouble, but there wasn't a thing dr'Shiver Hel could do
	about it. The bronze sat before him, relating what he'd learned. Cz raged
	and the dark elf couldn't care less for the plight of his notes. It was
	justified. </I>
	<P>
	<I>"Well and now," Shiver sighed, "we prepare as best we can under t'
	circumstances. 'Tis a dangerous time, Cz. Our hold on the Isles is less firm
	than we had believed, in part thanks to the insipid 'Children of Io' movement.
	I've been looking over the reports. We know the identity o' most o' the
	conspirators and a loss of their holdings would throw us back into a state
	of flux." </I>
	<P>
	<I>Cz nodded, his irritation apparent. "Factionalism, at it's worst. Even
	with benevolent goals, they'll throw us back to the decline of the old ways.
	If Val doesn't--" </I>
	<P>
	<I>With uncharacteristic anger, the dark elf shot upwards and yelled. "HE
	WILL NAE DIE! I'll fly t' this trap Onslaught has set and reveal just what
	I've mastered in t' long millennium o' my existence. Do they think they are
	free t' claim one of us without facing the wrath the false Gods have reason
	t' fear?" His knuckles glinted pale from the unnatural strength he concealed
	in his seeming as his grip tightened on Soul-Chill, his favored dark steel
	mace. The flanged heads glimmered in the dim embers of the braziers and the
	fae illumination his violet eyes produced. </I>
	<P>
	<I>Cz nodded. He'd seen it before when the last of Elisa Bixby's followers,
	the Covenant, were slain with the utter contempt of a rat catcher. Vermin.
	The notion ebbed from Shiver and Cz faced the ideal with grim determination.
	"I opposed you one, Shiv. Rianna and I brought that before the Council. You'll
	have my support this time." </I>
	<P>
	<I>The dragon humans called Dirge sank back into his chair. "Aye, I know.
	It comes full circle, Cz. I have felt the return of the huntress. Rianna
	the Red has arisen from the fate I allowed her t' fall to. Facing that will
	nae be... easy." </I>
	<P>
	<I>"Easy?" Cz forced a quick laugh. "And how do you think I feel, the jilted
	lover?" </I>
	<P>
	<I>The dark elf looked down. "I have an inkling..." He paused, stood up and
	spoke again. "I'm going t' gather some equipment. All we have t' do is rescue
	Valator, keep the balance on the Isles, put down the treachery in our own
	ranks, establish our strength on the contested shard of Britannia, welcome
	back zu'Rianna Blisterclaw, and reveal the history of our institution." </I>
	<P>
	<I>Cz's hands came to rest on his hips. "So what are you waiting for?" </I>

	<I>Dirge's answer was late in coming. The cold air wrapped around the bronze
	as if slowly trying to consume him. His breath caused clouds of fog to erupt
	from his parted lips. </I>
	<P>
	<I>"Damn it!" Cz erupted. "You're too damn controlled. If you nae be willing
	to do naught but 'gather equipment' and breathe your vile threats, I, Cz,
	Olam the eternal will take the fight to THEM!" The bronze's words rang of
	the pompousness those about him had come to know and love. </I>
	<P>
	<I>"I will take my bow," the ebony shaft glistend in the moonlight as Cz
	held it aloft with so little effort.</I>
	<P>
	<I>"And shoot them in the back, bronze?" Dirge interrupted. </I>
	<P>
	<I>"You are just as pompous as me, Shiver. You think you have me figured
	out? You think to play me as you did young Kate in your deceipt of Velf so
	long ago?" Shiver growled at the rememberance then smiled. </I>
	<P>
	<I>"Surely you're not surprised I know of these 'conquests' of a coward,
	friend? The stories are passed down, and do not think I do not watch mine
	own back for the day when you decide to try and take me out as well." Shiver's
	smile straightened to a thin lipped glare as Cz continued ranting. Slowly
	Shiver's hand went to his belt, always prepared should Cz go off 'the deep
	end' as the rivvin called it. </I>
	<P>
	<I>Rather than strike at Dirge, Cz continued, "While these complicated webs
	you weave may work, we do NOT have the luxury of your time line. I lay this
	bow down here, and pick up the weapon as I have adopted on Britania," Cz
	had whirled a large white war mace into the air and embedded it Dirge's desk.
	The strike caused Shiver to jump up and prepare a counter attack until he
	realized the attack was not at him. He thought about quickly dispatching
	the bronze but with the state of the Conclave, the uncertainess of the bronze's
	defenses, and now with Onshalugh, he decided the worst that would happen
	is a slight defeat . . . after all, he would not, could not die. </I>
	<P>
	<I>Cz admired the embedded White Mace of Leopard kind a moment then continued.
	"Shiver, will you join me, or will I alone take this fight to Ohnslaught?"
	Shiver paused a moment and thought of this, quickly weighing all the possible
	outcomes then smiled. Immediately Cz responded to his countenence, "and should
	I perish, my friend, we will loose another 'supporter' of our ways, and you
	alone shall stand against the rage. Unless you are a 'babe of Io' yourself?"
	Cz spat the remaining words as he removed the mace White Leopard had bestowed
	upon him so long ago. </I>
	<P>
	<I>He let the words sink coldly into Dirge's chest. He knew the words would
	cause Dirge's otherwise cold blood to boil. That's what he needed, that's
	what Val and the Conclave needed. A combined attack was all there was. Cz
	alone would strike massive damage into Ohnslaught's forces, but he knew he
	wouldn't succeed. Might can carry the world, but magic will always rule it!

	<P>
	<I>The dark elf chuckled, the laughter rising in the darkness, deep and a
	bit unsettling. "Ye are a brave one, my friend. And yet, what happens when
	we leave the hard-won Aerie open? We need t' make our counter-attack significant
	without dropping our guard here. I have three domains under my personal control,
	another five or six in all but name. Gather support from the silvers that
	will support thee, and from thy followers in the Bronze Cliffs. Give us a
	night to plan." </I>
	<P>
	<I>Cz sighed. He wanted Dirge's anger, his fury to rise. "A night? While
	Val--" </I>
	<P>
	<I>"Val will not die. He's a cunning dwarf and we have plans for him, do
	we not?" Dirge smiled softly, tapping the dark steel flanged horseman's mace
	at his side. "Soul-Chill and the mace Leopard bestowed into thy firm grip
	will sing side-by-side, but I will nae--" he paused, shaken. "I can nae have
	the blood of another friend on my sullied hands. Since Leopard escorted Rianna
	from--" </I>
	<P>
	<I>"She's returned." Cz's announcement startled Dirge beyond anything even
	he had expected. After all, Rianna had been Cz's lover, for a time. Whatever
	the deep and brass dragoness shared, it was something akin to a blood bond,
	like siblings, but that wasn't possible. Or was it? </I>
	<P>
	<I>"Tomorrow, then, after we confer with Verro. We'll need Ogotai and his
	fellow warriors to support the Aerie. There are many we cannot trust. They,
	however, have nothing to gain by betraying us." Dirge turned back to his
	desk, folding his shoulders in on himself. </I>
	<P>
	<I>Cz turned to the door, mind-racing. "Will you visit Rianna before we go?"
	</I>
	<P>
	<I>Dirge, not facing him again, spoke quietly. "Of course not. The situation
	is urgent." </I> <I>"I see." Cz closed the door to Dirge's office, and made
	his way toward his own. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<IMG SRC="bar.gif" WIDTH="510" HEIGHT="22" BORDER="0" ALIGN="Middle"> <I></I>
	<P>
	<I>In Dark Song Spire, the skeletal form of the dark elf held his sharp face
	framed in long fingered hands of midnight blue. His violet eyes were closed,
	his breathing no longer feigned for even the modicum of etiquette he maintained
	for Cz. </I>
	<P>
	<I>It had been a difficult time and his disappointment was swimming just
	under the surface. The enigmatic Children of Io, old Council nostolgia, had
	reared up and stirred up more controversy. The charybdis of discontent was
	slowly settling, but it ignited the old questions. Dirge wouldn't let the
	Conclave follow the "old ways" because the old ways had been proven
	failures--failures based on lies from the gravid eyes of power-mad Gods.
	Whether the deep's vision was the correct path or not, it was the one he
	would follow. The other road was littered in bones and last laughs, regardless
	of how frequently it was traveled. </I>
	<P>
	<I>Cz had entered his office a night before, told him of the plight of Valator
	of the Riadaim. Grax Gorin, bearing the title Valator, had become a friend
	to Dirge. Like Cz, he knew the deep's inner turmoil and dedication to a vision
	he didn't even believe in. They never shouted hypocrite. Instead, they kept
	him focused and preoccupied. In the silence, the shame raged, the questions
	begged answers. The answers were worse than the doubt. </I>
	<P>
	<I>A world without "Gods" was impossible. A world with "Gods" was intolerable.
	To kill a God, he needed to become a God. To become a God, he would have
	to loose the last fragments of his sanity. All the seductive whisperings
	of Tiamat buzzed in his ear. Chronepsis was cool and distant. </I>
	<P>
	<I>He was preparing for the changes. The Magnus Regus of the three Laecertus
	and the twin Lords of the Conclave had to be merged. More control and speed
	was necessary in the organization. The emergence of the Children of Io
	demonstrated that. The situation with the riders of the Steppe was still
	tense. Dirge needed their loyalty. He hoped they needed his. They participation
	in the Battle of All Clans had led to the destruction of the most prominent
	Copper, a foothold on Aridia Isle, the recovery of the Conclave loyal clan
	of Cutharn, and the swaying of two Council strongholds on Bloodtide, Fastwing
	and Sunleap. Jagatei, recently returned from Toril, would want to oversea
	the reconstruction of one of the domains. </I>
	<P>
	<I>And then, as if the bronze feared the news would unsettle Dirge even more,
	he mentioned the return of Rianna. Rianna... Dirge had thought to use her
	like he used Great Wyrm and ReKlaive, but she was made of stronger stuff.
	She was his equal, despite their difference in age, and--in many ways--his
	superior. He was the mind of the Conclave, Cz and Val the soul, and she...
	the heart. He had a dream of her in leathers died black, the scarred pommel
	of her broadsword close to her rough hands. It was what woke him, brought
	him back to his desk. </I>
	<P>
	<I>It was his fault Faluzure afflicted her with the wasting. It was his fault
	she had left and Leopard, out of noble commitment, as her escort. It was
	his fault the Conclave thought her dead. Was it worth it? The question coursed
	through his mind as the waves in Io's Bay crashed against the shore of All
	Clans Isle. The Aerie hummed in quiet chorus with his guilt. </I>
	<P>
	<I>He sighed and picked up a Terran book with a curious title--"A Boy's Will."
	He turned to a poem entitled "Wind and Window Flower" and read, relishing
	the author's name like a cool drink. Frost. "How appropriate," he muttered,
	and read until his sight was bleary and the sun spit its warming rays into
	his darkened abode. And then he slept. </I>

	<P>
	<I>The bronze returned to his quarters and slammed the door. "Not even an
	ounce of emotion. Who the hell does he think he is!?" Cz screamed throughout
	his hollow chambers. The dull echo eventually touched everything in the room
	until it subsided into an annoying ring. "Couriers!" he bellowed. Immediately
	there was a scurrying of feet and of doors creaking open and slamming shut.
	'Here my lord!' rang in unison as two of his most trusted couriers entered
	and posted. </I>
	<P>
	<I>Olam never turned around to face them, he knew them to listen careful
	and needed no reassurance they were listening. "I require a message be relayed
	to the Magnus Regus of the Metallics, ag'Saidar . . ." </I>
	<P>
	<I>His pause was unintentional, but he couldn't help thinking of the history
	he shared with the silver. They had known each other since their emergence
	in the Aerie's own hatchery. Their separation had almost cost them their
	friendship. The separation was somewhat involuntary. Saidar had chosen to
	follow the training of the Aerie's wizards. They removed him from the Aerie
	so that he could "concentrate." </I>
	<P>
	<I>Meanwhile Cz had chosen to join the Aerie's warriors. He defended the
	Aerie from many attacks and it wasn't until the day of the quest -- the quest
	in which he eventually met Dirge - that he was to return to the Aerie and
	take claim of his rightful place. They thought they would never see each
	other again, but Saidar had made his own place in the way of the things,
	and his surprisingly quick advancement in the ranks of the dragon magicians
	earned him his current role in the Aerie's history. It was this very background
	that made Cz uncomfortable. He dislike asking friends to go into battle with
	him. It was just something else to worry about. Secretly Cz wished he was
	as uncaring as Dirge appeared to be. "It's to bad I'm not like Shiver, you
	don't see him worried that I may be killed. Bastard probably doesn't even
	realize I'm his friend." Cz caught himself saying the words aloud as he spun
	around. </I>
	<P>
	<I>The servants had heard everything. His look was all they needed to swear
	secrecy. "I require Saidar to know of what has transgressed and that I need
	his assistance in an upcoming campaign. Tell him to mobilize those that he
	trusts and to report to me at once!" They turned around to leave. "Hold!"
	The two almost fell over each other trying to break the stride they had already
	produced. </I>
	<P>
	<I>"I trust that one of you can handle this?" He didn't wait for answer.
	"Lornick, you shall go to Rianna, Queen of the Dragons." The servant look
	perplexed. For good reason, the queen had been thought dead long ago. She
	was but a myth to the younger dragons of the Aerie and Lornick had only himself
	seen her once in his entire service with Cz. The love that Cz and Rianna
	shared was well known and no one had spoken of it since. 'Rianna, my lord?
	You are speaking of the Queen of Dragons?' </I>
	<P>
	<I>Cz let the question fall into silence. He began to instruct Lornick of
	Rianna's location and how to reach her. "I have been to her in my dreams
	already and though it may take you time to reach her, reach her you shall.
	Tell her we require the heart of the Aerie once more. The Conclave requires
	her to return and I can no longer be expected to pretend I am capable of
	replacing her. We have a good many within the Conclave that push towards
	the old ways and it is necessary that she return." Lornick waited for a last
	sign off, a sign that Cz's feelings were still strong for her . . . "your
	Friend," Cz forced out, "cn'Olam Cz." </I>
	<P>
	<I>Lornick memorized the words and unintentionally the pain on his lord's
	face. 'It shall be done, sir.' With that he carefully removed himself from
	the chamber and left Cz to his chosen fate... </I>

	<P>
	<FONT COLOR="#8080ff"><I>Posted by ((Valator)) Crinshinabaum the Radiant
	on February 23, 1998: </I></FONT> <I></I>
	<P>
	<I>Across the frozen wastes they came, the leaders of the exiled Council
	of Wyrms. Drawn from afar by the summons of The Radiant, they braved the
	long trip over open sea to keep far from the sight of Conclave Wyrms and
	their vassal races. The dragons from the southern isles had fared worst of
	all, but once the keep of the frost giant jarl Glitterdome came into sight,
	they felt the warmth of familiar power once again. </I>
	<P>
	<I>The Radiant was enormous, fully twice the length of the largest red from
	Clan Scorch and radiating magic and psionics that was overwhelming to those
	dragons with the power to sense such things naturally. He was all colors
	at once as his pearly scales reflected light into patterns that danced across
	the icey walls of the mammoth caverns. Frost giants sat long the northern
	wall behind the greatest wyrm, watching the entrance of the dragons with
	great interest and more than a little fear. The Chromatics clustered together,
	staying far back against the south walls and as far from The Radiant's piercing
	gaze as possible. The Prismatics stood directly before the Radiant, waiting
	with baited breath for the silent colossus to speak. The Metallics were
	scattered, clustering together in groups of matching scales, they seemed
	the most uncomfortable of all. </I>
	<P>
	<I>Finally, as the last leader of dragons entered the hall, the Frost Giants
	closed the great doors and magical illumination sprung into being from high
	above, bathing the wyrms in a cool white. The great celestial dragon rose
	to sit upon his rear legs, his enormous tail and wings curled around his
	body in a fashion that spoke of total confidence in his own safety. </I>
	<P>
	<I>"The Conclave stole the Aerie from you, they ousted you from the seats
	held by your ancestors and thrust you from glory into a meager life of simply
	existing instead of ruling over Cynnabaris as is your birthright and the
	gift from Io himself. The shattered clans were stripped of even that, their
	homes taken or levelled, their vassals slain or conquered and given to the
	victors as spoils. The Challenge of Wing and Claw was ignored, Shiver Hel
	setting a terrible precedent by declaring each of you to be rogue, and by
	extension your children and followers. Humans and Dwarves rule you now,
	indirectly in most cases, but the Sapphire, Coppers, and Golds face the shame
	of having these mere mortals as direct superiors! Lesser races given the
	titles of draconic nobility and the seat of power of clans that never had
	the choice to accept them into their fold, much less the choice of whether
	or not to have them as leaders!" </I>
	<P>
	<I>The Radiant paused to let the opening words sink in. The Golds and Sapphires
	had lowered their heads and met no gazes while the coppers ground foreclaws
	into the stone floor and gnashed teeth with brewing rage at the thought of
	what had befallen them. The rest of the dragons, especially the Prismatics,
	seemed to be stirring, the words being the hated truth. </I>
	<P>
	<I>"The Council of Wyrms lives again, and I stand as the head of this council!
	We shall begin by raising our forces to allow the shattered refugees from
	the destroyed clans be able to once more occupy those lands stolen by the
	Conclave heretics. Once we succeed there, we shall go to the Aerie and declare
	ourselves the true council and forgive the misguided children of their sins.
	The Council will absorb the Conclave and we will begin actions to pacify
	those wayward vassals that call themselves Sterre Riadaim. Dragon shall rule
	over all other intelligent life once again, as we are Io's favored sons and
	daughters, we are they who the Ninefold created before and above all others!
	We are the masters of all we survey and we will never bow to the heretics
	again! " </I> <I>The dragons were aroused by the passion in The Radiant's
	voice, they understood why quite a few younger Council wyrms could treat
	him as a god or even as a manifestation of Io himself. Every dragon present
	was a leader though, the best of their clan and not given to taking worsds
	lightly. "What makes you think they will accept us back? Do the Conclave
	Loyalists not treat their Sterre Riadaim riders as masters and bend to their
	every whim?" asked Sunray the Gold. "I remember when Valator of the Star
	Riders challenged Niteweaver. Shiver Hel threatened her with death and
	disintegration should she attack the pathetic old Dwarf! The silver that
	Valator rode as if it were a pony also leapt to the Dwarf's defense! A Deep
	and a Silver rose to defend an intruder together! It was a terrible day,
	but made more so when Dirge slew his detractors in cold blood during their
	coup against us! Corum and Arc were murdered by the Deep and the Bronze who
	they trusted! Why, Shining Radiance, should we give them the chance tro repent?
	Should we not destroy that treacherous blood once and for all? Will other
	dragons mimic the aberrant behavior these Conclave wyrms exhibit? </I>
	<P>
	<I>The Radiant cocked his head to the side and examined the gold. Sunray
	was still young, barely mature enough to attempt to hold a clan, her abilities
	untested to this point. Her City of the Sun had been bypassed during the
	All Clans War, her Clan Sunblaze never attempting to support their fellow
	wyrms based upon arguments about freedom and liberty for all. They changed
	their tone soon after, when they saw the fleeing Whites of Clan Glare drop
	from the sky bearing lances of Star Rider steel within their bellys alongside
	terrible wounds inflicted by their own draconian cousins. The Golds of Sunblaze
	rose to the sky but were intercepted by the CLan Exaurdon and told to return
	to tehir homes. The Sunblaze golds complied with those orders out of fear
	and confusion, finally realizing their folly later, when they were exiled
	from the Aerie and Io himself called a fairy tale by the wicked Deep that
	abolished the council and allowed the filth mortals to walk the sacred Council
	halls. </I> <I>"They will receive their chance to repent and ask Io's
	forgiveness, noble Sunray. Think for a moment, milady, should the roles be
	reversed and we were the delusional destroyers. Would you not wish the chance
	to see forgiveness from the Ninefold and live with the knowledge that, when
	you finally pass from the world, Io will accept you by his wing as a true
	child of dragon? I wish this, though I have faltered and worked with mortals
	at times in my past. I would loathe to slay one of my own kind outside of
	the Wing and Claw, and terribly worse it would be for that victim to not
	feel our creator's embrace but instead journey into eternal oblivion like
	the mortals do."</I>

	<I>The words seem to carry less meaning for him each day. His words of
	encouragement, his words of family, honor, and love. His words moved no one,
	not even himself. The days blurred, the days became nights and nights gave
	way to the rising star "Surely you'd planned more for me," Olam cried upward.
	</I>
	<P>
	<I>There was no answer. The dull echo only resounded throughout his quarters.
	The Triad's insignia blazoned across his chest. The reflection from his scales
	played against the golden trinkets strew about his room. He sighed. </I>
	<P>
	<I>There was no glory in the politicking. There was no joy without companionship.
	There was no meaning without battle. </I>
	<P>
	<I>"You're a bronze, you fool, yet you sit up here and feast only on words."
	</I>
	<P>
	<I>His statement felt good. He'd actually admitted something to himself that
	he could only dream of saying outloud. It made him think . . . </I>
	<P>

	<I>Much of his strength had been waining of late. He'd only begun his routine
	workouts a couple months earlier. The energy he felt as his muscles ached
	invigorated him. He knew his days of politicking were coming to a close .
	. . if they didn't he'd die of boredom. He stretched. Again the tighness
	in his muscles assured him he'd been inactive too long. He stretched . .
	. bones cracked. He looked at the quill in his hand. The ink had already
	gone dry during his thoughts. </I>
	<P>
	<I>He dipped the quill into the ink well and watched the ink slowly cover
	the used ink of before and swallow the tip. He laughed. "How amusing that
	you, lifeless quill and ink doth posess the uncanny ability to act like my
	life." He returned the quill to it's resting place and stood up. Stepping
	out onto the balcony he transformed. His wings stretched to their full span
	across the wide outcropping. The midday sun felt good upon his chest, wings
	and legs. "I do believe I have had enough of this office, I do believe it's
	time for a change . . . " </I>

	<P>
	<I>The wind caught effortlessly below Olam's wings. The sheer pleasure of
	flight would never be lost on him, this he vowed. "Never take this for granted,"
	he muttered to himself as the ground rushed below his body. The air rushed
	through his bronzed mane and tufts of bronze hair under his chin whipped
	against his neck. Soon, his mind relaxed and he was able to close his mind
	and practice flying without actually using his physical sight. </I>
	<P>
	<I>The images were no where near the same as his normal eyes. The peripheral
	was clouded yet somehow known. But in front, in front of him the view was
	not that of normal colors and shapes. No, these images were of energy and
	shades changed not how the light played on the image, but more how much energy
	each object contained. A rush of pale blues and pale yellows shot by him
	as he increased his speed. Suddenly a bright red object loomed in front of
	him! He banked left and opened his eyes in time to see a massive tree absorb
	his body effortlessly. </I>
	<P>
	<I>The impact cracked a few of his ribs. The fall did him no better. Dazed
	as he was, he managed to look up at the tree. Chuckling he laid back as the
	pain hurt more when he laughed. "Cosmetic damage? That's all you can give
	me tree?" He laughed some more and winced some more. Quickly muttering some
	ancient tongue, the longterm damage would be halted. The current pain, however,
	would not be disappearing. He laid back again and thought about what just
	happened. The long distance vision he was used to relying on was different
	from this . . . the energy patterns must need some time to play out in his
	mind. He needed to improve this . . . training improved all he often told
	his vassals and friends. This he would do. For now, the first trip out of
	the office was not as pleasurable as he'd hoped. But then again, it beat
	a paper cut! </I>

	<FONT COLOR="#8080ff"><I></I></FONT> <I>The bronze stood up once again. His
	back ached a tad from his impromptu bed of leaves and brush. "Flying,gotta
	love it . . ." he chuckled. Looking about he decided it better to rely on
	his physical sight for awhile until he acquired a better master over this
	new method. Taking to the skies he made his way home. His quarters loomed
	up quickly, but rather than land on the outcropping leading in, he decided
	to walk amongst the gardens and courtyard. </I>
	<P>
	<I>A cloud came up around his feet as he landed. The soft landings he'd come
	to make often impressed him. He took pride in his mastery of the large body
	he'd now come to live in. The aches of growth only pained him once in awhile,
	he'd manage. </I>
	<P>
	<I>Going through some papers he had in a pouch, Olam decided to review past
	reports in some effort to bring him up to speed on recent changes outside
	of the bronze celare and Aerie. The reports were oft bleak and seldom yielded
	good news. Much of the ordered scouting on Ohnslaught had ended up in failure,
	they'd lost one dragon already. The young one . . . his name lost now to
	history. Cz cursed that he couldn't remember his name, but then again, so
	many had fallen already, what was one more? </I>
	<P>
	<I>"Dragons," he said half aloud, "we're meant to be few and elite, why shouldn't
	I be surprised when another falls?" </I>
