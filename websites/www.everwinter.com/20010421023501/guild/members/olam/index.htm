	      <P ALIGN=Center>
	      <I>The eggs the bronze clan of Battlewing donated to the greater good had
	      always been known for their size. This egg was no exception. Its creation
	      was, most assuredly, more fun than it's passing. Its mother was laid out
	      for almost a year after it passed. It was more by her choice than anyone's
	      that the egg be donated to the Aerie's hatchery.</I></TD>

	<I><B>FIRST FRIENDS</B></I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>In the hatchery many dragon's of all the clans were born. Two eggs, for
	one reason or another, lay close to each other. The infantile bond was subtle
	but grew as the two dragons hatched. Out of the shards came a silver and
	a bronze. Both had no idea how, but knew they had conversed with one another,
	albeit simple and short, mentally. The camaraderie grew between them. They
	became inseparable. Battles were fought and arguments settle between them
	constantly; if it wasn't over a female, it was over another -- no less valuable
	-- bauble.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>The two were separated at a young age to continue their trainings with
	their assigned mentors. Cz had followed the ways of his clan, and chose to
	follow the grand battlemaster of the Aerie, White Leopard.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Saidar chose to follow the curiosity of the magiks of the realms.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Cz followed most of White Leopard's training well. Leopard's defensive
	abilities were astounding and his offensive tactics deadly. It amazed Cz
	that one so old could move so quickly. He vowed to impress Leopard. The two
	spent many hours training. Most of their training occurred outside of the
	Aerie's safe walls and in Toril. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Toril was a land of rivvin and other ill-created humanoids. Most of them
	Leopard advised keeping away from . . . Cz didn't. He was sure he knew best
	and was often mistreated and cheated. The experiences were taking to heart
	and soon Cz developed a hardened shell, a shield of sorts. He used it in
	most all situations. A personality he had come to use to protect him, a
	cockiness, as it was described by those who knew him the least.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Leopard watched as Cz matured and grew. As Cz improved his skills, he
	actually began choosing the ways of the ranger . . . just like Leopard. Cz
	loved the forest and its mysteries. It was during this time of</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>bonding that Leopard started to show Cz of the magicks of the realm. During
	Cz's training, it was necessary for him to give up the life of the bow and
	attempt to use only blunted, non-edged weapons. Despite his arguments against
	such folly, Cz agreed. He gave up the fine bow he loved and attempted to
	master this new life of magic.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I><B>MAGIKS EXPLORED</B></I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>The first forays he encountered were horrid. Cz continually rushed into
	the front lines despite his dusty melee skills. Intrigued by Cz's courage,
	Leopard gave Cz a mystical mace. The mace felt good and</I> <I>unusually
	nimble in Cz's hands . . . so much so, he dubbed it the White Mace of Leopard
	kind, to honor the donor. Leopard smiled and noted that if the mace were
	used to combat evil, it would be enough payment. Despite this relinquishment,
	Cz kept the name and actually had it engraved on the mace's handle. During
	this time Cz happened to be introduced to Dirge. Dirge, in Cz's opinion a
	malnurished,physically challenged dragon, was surprisingly friendly to him.
	The two enjoyed many adventures and were known to harass some locals when
	the need arose. Soon their friendship grew strong. But then one day, Dirge
	vanished. His seeming was no longer seen in Toril and rumors surfaced of
	encounters with Falzure. Cz was devastated. The hopes that Dirge would survive
	such an encounter diminished each day and soon Cz gave up any hope. The loss
	of hope was noticed . . .</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I><B>THE CHANGE</B></I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>He apparently didn't notice Cz's gradual change, as it wasn't until the
	adjectives used to describe Cz started to surface: cocky, know-it-all,
	stand-offish. They all tried to describe Cz in one word. Leopard couldn't
	believe it. The dragon's using these words did not know Cz. Leopard assumed
	it was his doing and felt responsible. He told Cz, "I will no longer be around
	. . . you must carry on your training without</I> <I>me." Those words were
	the last Cz heard of Leopard. Occasionally Cz would here rumors of Leopard's
	conquests in another realm, but they were, after all, only rumors.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Cz's days of training grew tiresome and he needed adventure. The Toril
	he knew was too comfortable. Neverwinter became crowded. Even the closer,
	outlying cities became congested. Frustrated at the lack of knowledge and
	commitment to honor he encountered, he crossed the dangerous hills of Berun.
	While at the temple, Cz heard of vast treasures and dangerous giants to the
	south. Excited he headed</I> <I>everywhere the rumors carried him. He placed
	the mace away for safe keeping and picked up his bow once more!</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Westgate amused Cz for a small time. The giants were smaller than normal
	giants, but occasionally a band of fire giants would come through and attempt
	to ravish the land. It was in one of these mammoth battles that Cz heard
	a familar voice. The war cry only preceeded a deafening meteorshower by mere
	seconds, but Cz recognized the cry . . . Saidar! Cz's excitement turned sour
	when he saw the mage in hand-to-hand combat with one of the giants. Confined
	to his rivvin seeming, Saidar was not in a fair fight. It was the sight of
	the token bronze-tipped arrow pointing out of the giant's forehead that made
	Saidar smile.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I><B>THE RENUION</B></I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>The two dragon's ignored the battle that raged on around. Saidar pushed
	the giant's arm off him and arose. He looked Cz up and down and laughed,
	"A warrior are ye, now?" Cz chuckled. He placed his bow on his back and hugged
	his friend, "You've made a fine magician, friend." Come, show me a card trick!"
	Cz laughed out loud as Saidar pulled out some cards and threw them at some
	giants. The two shared a laugh as the giant ducked, thinking them more deadly
	than they were.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>After that battle, the two were inseparable. The frequent habitats of
	the giants were a common place to the find the two. Often times they would
	be found attacking them alone. Many times they would come up</I> <I>empty,
	but it didn't matter. Treasure or not, the boyhood battles were here again!</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>In fact, most of their life was happy until the days that Toril began
	to change . . .</I>
