	      <I>The countryside rushed passed him as he swiftly ran down the road. One
	      of the greatest benefits that Bristlebane has granted him had to have been
	      the ability to go places. Arturiss shot across the plains on his way home
	      to Qeynos. It had been many years since his last visit to his father&#146;s
	      house. He longed for the winding streets of his youth once again.</I></TD>

	<I>Upon reaching the Town Square, a friendly voice sang from the near by
	doorway, &#147;Arturiss? Arturiss d&#146;Hivernuit? I can not believe my
	eyes!&#148; &#147;What be there no greeting for an old friend and daughter
	of your tutor?&#148; Luciana Loresinger beamed a smile at him. The young
	Loresinger stood there glimmering in her form fitting leather showing her
	shape. Beauty personified stood before him, as well as his childhood love.
	</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>&#147;Aye my lady. My tongue be in shock from seeing your beauty once
	again. Please forgive my rudeness and accept this as a gift and my most humble
	apologies.&#148; He bowed low, and, with a quick flick of his wrist, he held
	out a pair of beautiful golden earrings. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>&#147;Ye little devil. You always had a way to make me blush. Come let
	us catch up with what trouble you have been into.&#148; She blushed and wrapped
	her arms around him, catching him offguard. She placed he arm around him
	and led him to the pub. &#147;Tell me of your travels. I want to hear all
	about the places of which you visited.&#148; </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Stories spilled freely for several hours. Tales were told of the cold
	northern climbs and the far off desert of Ro. Luciana&#146;s eyes were wide
	with excitement. She had never ventured farther that Surefall Glade. Knowing
	that his stories were mystifying her Arturiss decided to save the best for
	last. After all the stories of Freeport and Crushbone, he made his way to
	the horror that is the Estate of Unrest. Gripping tightly to his arm Luciana
	face went flush with fear. &#147;How did you ever find the courage to travel
	to such a place? How fowl it must have been.&#148; Time passed as each story
	unfolded to the next.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>&#147;Tis much different from your youth. Ye are still the curious boy
	that ye are now, but I sense a change in ye, a kind of weatherworn quality.
	Ye used to run around singing yer songs, sometimes tripping or playing practical
	jokes on the guards. Occasionally, taking what is nay yours from a distracted
	shopkeeper!&#148; she spat poking an accusatory finger in his chest. &#147;You
	can nay prove a thing.&#148; Answered Arturiss grinning from ear to ear.
	&#147;Aye my youth was fun filled, but I have seen and done much since then
	to over-shadow such wonderful times.&#148; His eyes became distant for just
	a moment. &#147;It has been a pleasure my dear but I must be off. I fear
	my travels must take me away once again.&#148; He noticed a slight mist come
	over her eyes. &#147;I shall return shortly my dear, and you know me to keep
	safe.&#148; </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>&#147;Aye, that I do.&#148; She turned her back on his to cover the tears.
	Wind spun around her, and she turned only to find two empty chairs in an
	empty caf&eacute;. He was gone once more.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>&#147;Love lost, love left<BR>
	Ne&#146;er to be had, ne&#146;er to be kept.<BR>
	A tear shed for those that have gone<BR>
	Into a new horizon I shall sing my song.&#148; </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>The guards only saw a blur and felt the air rush past them as Arturiss
	entered the city. &#145;They really must be used to it since they have one
	of the largest Bard guilds in the world.&#146; Thought Arturiss, as he weaved
	in and out of the day&#146;s traffic. A mischievous grin came to his face
	as he thought of old times and running around in the aqueducts that snaked
	under the city. &#147;For old times.&#148; He whispered right before diving
	into the monk&#146;s pond. Hours he spent running through the twisting
	tunnels.</I>
