<I>It has been less than three days since I&#146;ve returned to Toril. Aneste
and Cade have my house in good order, despite my absence. They arranged a
sizable purchase of Alurlyath from the nearby drow city of Rilauven, courting
the favor of their Valsharess, Nedylene. I have a penchant for good wine,
and the Temple is known for the best. They have likewise saw to my mundane
needs&#133; conversion of our coins, stocking of the pantries, a suitable
wardrobe, and so forth. They&#146;ve been diligent and that speaks highly
of their devotion. It makes my exile so much more tolerable, though I miss
my home&#133; and I miss Vespre.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>It is not right that I should be separated from my wife so soon after
our wedding and yet how can I tolerate existence on Terra? It is a gray world,
devoid of magic. I plan on splitting my time between Toril and my wife&#146;s
abode until I can solve our curse. Shar and Shard, so young, will not miss
the ways of their home. Norrath is behind them, Terra ahead. When the time
comes, they will welcome our estate on Toril and revel in the magic at our
disposal, but I digress.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Since arriving, Aneste made known the appearance of others of my kind.
It appears they were exiled here. I confess that I was surprised at the
Council&#146;s reaction. My sentence was rather barbaric, but predictable.
I posed a serious threat to their way of life. On the other hand, cn&#146;Olam
and zu&#146;Rianna were everything a member of the Council should be&#151;heroic
and self-sacrificing, if somewhat vain. Then again, there are few of my kind
that aren&#146;t arrogant. Given our gifts, can you blame us? That was
rhetorical. Our splendor is obvious, even to the humans I am now surrounded
by. Even those of the metallic bloodlines are more than a human could ever
be&#133;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>And yet folly is not something we&#146;ve evolved past. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>White Leopard, the venerable mentor of Rianna, accompanied her. Others
seem to have been exiled, though I know not why. ag&#146;Saidar, companion
to cn&#146;Olam, is said to have voluntarily followed his friend. I have
heard tell that cr&#146;Melody has also traveled to this land. Was she, too,
exiled? I had little to do with Clan Bloodtide, though they seemed like admirable
allies. Who else might have come to Toril?</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>I shall make the time to meet my brethren and ascertain their intentions.
Are they truly exiled or have they come seeking my head? If they have been
exiled, what do they plan for themselves?</I>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<I><IMG WIDTH="510" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="Middle" BORDER="0" SRC="bar.gif"></I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>As I said, we have not matured beyond folly. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>I have spoken to cn&#146;Olam, the bronze from Clan Battlewing. I
couldn&#146;t help but note how frequently he punctuated his dislike of me
by reaching to the pommel of his blade. I suppose he was banished because
of me, though it was his own audacity to meddle in that which he did not
understand&#151;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Suffice it to say, our discussion was strained, though I learned much.
It seems the Council was moving against another trend. A gold, very young
and idealistic, believed he was touched by Io. He calls himself the "Great
Wyrm", claiming to be an spokesman of Io&#146;s Will. Naturally, Io&#146;s
will conflicted with that of the Council&#146;s and he, along with several
ardent followers, found themselves banished to Neverwinter. Olam and Rianna,
at the request of White Leopard, have supported this mad drake&#146;s labor
to build another Aerie, another Council of Wyrms.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>I know little of Toril, but I know dragons will not be welcomed with open
arms. I have taken great cares to conceal my origin and nature, yet this
youth would place me at risk by naming me a "fellow wyrm." Last night in
the Red Mage&#146;s Inn, I had to assure my drinking companions he was sadly
mistaken, but it was embarrassing. He&#146;ll be a blight on my reputation
soon enough, to be sure&#133; this mad man claiming to be related to the
likes of me&#133;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Still, I must gain the confidence of these other exiles. I need to know
how many there are. The hatchling will be dealt with when I have assumed
my rightful position as their leader. I can easily provide a vision more
enticing than the bloated worm&#146;s. I&#146;ll have to think on this matter
a bit. I&#146;d like to preserve my reputation as a mercenary within the
confines of Neverwinter, but having the assistance of fellow dragons could
also be an asset. </I>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<I><IMG WIDTH="510" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="Middle" BORDER="0" SRC="bar.gif"></I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Again, I am amazed. I began tracking membership among the new Council
in the guild hall district. The organization is so poor I was easily able
to slip into the position of scribe. Olam and Rianna, perhaps the only members
who would readily recognize me, are often out, traveling the land. Wanderlust
is a seductive mistress, but I&#146;m resilient, defiant to such desires.
I have too much to loose to succumb to the embrace of roving, reveling in
my power among these lessers. My kind has a tendency to squander their gifts.
Hoard treasure, spreading our wings, making men cower or bow in awe&#133;
this should not be our way. Power is our way and with this strength, the
ability to enlighten the young races. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Power, however, can manifest in two distinct breeds. It can be the direct
use of force, be it physical or magical, or the indirect use of knowledge,
through the manipulation of events. There is a place and time for both forms.
Now is the time for knowledge and subtle use of our gifts, not the bold
declaration&#133; "We are dragons; hear us roar!" Such can lead to incredulity,
mocking, or enough fear or ego to elicit dragon-hunters. Too many of this
young Council can not defend themselves. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The roaring has already attracted the attention of another House, known
as ITB. Those "in the bond" are power-hungry, rash, and ruthless. They would
have slave dragons, dragon heads in their dens, and the treasure my kind
hoards. Despite their age, I must admit they are powerful adversaries. The
chaotic Council has quickly showed their inability to deal with humans, their
innate sense of greatness. Pride is fine, when justified. Here it has not
been proven. The "great" wyrm runs to other guilds, crying for assistance
against the predators of House ITB. I find myself embarrassed, disappointed,
and&#133; ready to defend the name dragon. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>I see two courses of action must be taken. The first, fight and defeat
a member of the House in single combat. I will not revel in the victory,
but treat it as if I expect to win. I do, frankly. They are formidable, but
so am I. Keep the weak of the Council sheltered and attack any exposed flank
in the House with the strongest. Give them pause. A war becomes futile if
the cost is too high, and the gain too little. They stand nothing to gain
by our defeat. We are new-comers to this land, held in contempt or ignored
by most. Our defeat would be expected and trivial. On the other hand, any
success, however minor, against this House ITB would strain their reputation.
</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Second, I must eliminate the madness at the head of the Council. There
are many within their ranks that have potential. Though the metallics have
never been as strong as my family, they are still dragons and powerful in
their way. Their moral center guides them into what can be weakness&#133;
but so to can they make allies among the young races, in a way a chromatic
couldn&#146;t or wouldn&#146;t. Removing this "great" wyrm will leave room
for a one with more rationale. I have seen several promising dragons&#133;
White Leopard is an obvious choice, though his student Rianna is charismatic
and more passionate. Reklaive, a gold from Toril, could be a good choice
as well.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>I shall endeavor to face the humans of House ITB, at least one of them,
and buy this Council a chance.</I>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<I><IMG WIDTH="510" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="Middle" BORDER="0" SRC="bar.gif"></I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The fight was a silence-slavery match. The terms were simple. Should I
win, ITB would leave the new quarters of the Council alone, ceasing their
frequent harassment. Should I fail, I would declare my servitude to House
ITB. I can tell you, I had no interest in being a servant. As fate would
have it, I was victorious in the duel, though the battle was closer than
I had hoped and my win could be called luck, not the clear-cut victory I
had sought. I played the victory well, though. I won respect by not bragging.
In return, the House honored the terms, and the Council has been quiet of
late.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>I have heard House ITB is constantly at war with self-declared demigods
known as KAAOS. Perhaps my victory would prove ample target for the jeers
of these demigods. I knew two, a woman known as Xylina, and a man known as
War Knight. I had drank with them more than once, and Xylina and I had teamed
up to hunt down a so-called ally of the young Council. Great Wyrm was quick
to challenge my authority. After all, I broke an alliance. And yet, this
was the excuse I had been waiting for. None of the Council members seemed
sure of their leader, nor the alliance he had forged. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>I met the Great Wyrm in the Arena of Triboar, after his many falls on
the way through the Lost Hills. He was escorted by a formidable knight, the
Earl of Daggerford, Johan Graye. He was courting cr&#146;Melody of Bloodtide,
to my amazement, but he was an honorable man. He encouraged the leader of
the Council to fight honorable, to fight with heart and his steel. I could
see the doubt in his eye. He could not help but see the disparity between
the two of us.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Great Wyrm had followed the route of the paladin, serving the human deity
known as Tyr, the Justice-Bringer, as well as Io. We honored the traditions
of the Arena. Many priests of Tyr from the nearby temple were present to
support their young champion. Faurual Blackhammer, Lord of Triboar, made
an unexpected visit, as did my old companion Odinsun. I thought I could see
Olam and Rianna in the crowd, though they remained neutral.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Next to the fluted plate and mail of the young lad, I seemed frail. As
always, I was dressed in my royal purple cloak, breeches and doublet of black
silk, platinum jewelry and Soul-Forge, my favored weapon, in hand. I ran
my long blue fingers through my bone-white hair smiling. Dark elves were
not uncommon, particularly in the area. My midnight blue skin was a bit odd,
but the drow accepted it as an oddity. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>I marveled at how young he was, how na&iuml;ve next to me. Faluzure declares
you should never underestimate an opponent. I did not, though any cause for
planning was moot. The hero does not always win. In fact, it is rarely the
case. My spells cut him down as he tried&#151;pitiably--to fend off the kampfult
of the Arena with an enchanted blade. In the end, he tried to poison me,
drawing on a scroll beyond his power. I saw the Earl drop his face in
disappointment and shame. Naturally, the spell rolled off of me. You can
hide the scales, but they remain.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>I summoned the power for a killing blow, touched him lightly on the his
exposed hand as he struggled within the grasp of the tree-like creatures.
I drew the last breath of life from his body. Priestly healing magic was
powerful when reversed to harm. He learned, but too late. The clergy of Tyr
tried to revive him, but the Gods were kind. They claimed the false dragon.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The Council returned to the Hall. There were decisions to be made in the
next few days. I would steer them down the path of greatness.</I>
