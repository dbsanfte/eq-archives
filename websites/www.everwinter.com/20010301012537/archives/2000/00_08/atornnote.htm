<I>A torn excerpt of a journal written in Tier&#146;Dal dated quit some time
ago*</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>To all those of the House of Winterborne,</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>I Rackin Di&#146;Githyen of past aquaitence of both Conclave of Wyrm and
The House of Winterborne do henceforth renounce any and formal ties to The
House of Winterborne. I will no longer wear this badge of honor for I can
no longer wear its burden. From the start of the Winterborne I have shown
my support and aided when was possible for me to do so. Most of you have
seen me through some troubling times as of late; the reappearance of my daughter
((OOC: she never met any of you but was part of the ongoing story with Rack)),
my dip into the madness which was pure hatred of all things alive, and even
the loss of all memories and the recovery of what I believe to be my humanity.
I have often been in the dark corners in far of lands where it is hard to
reach me or for me to aid you in your journeys. Because of my lack of
participation I renounce the name Winterborne. Because of my lack attempts
to get to know you I renounce the name Winterborne. I do regret my lack of
participation but I know that I will not regret my dispersal from this
group.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>To Peony Furfoot and her ever faithful husband Dolgo, I pray our paths
will cross again and that you will not look &#147;down&#148; on me for my
decision. To Trespare Winterclaw, also known as Rianna the Queen of the House.
Thank you for leading such a fine guild and for showing strength when times
where ill fated. To Erondis, brother, friend, the person I never quite figured
out who or what he truly was. I thank you for teaching me the tongue of the
Dragon and for seeing so many days go by in the dessert of Southern Ro with
Peony and I. To Dirge my your studies take you places and my your road be
easier then my own. Balkin warrior in arms, Train well your weaponry and
see that you fight each battle with a personal code. If no code exists then
what are you truly fighting for. Zsalshun D&#146;Vox, you powers and
understanding of the Tier&#146;Dal are much greater then you understand.
You have seen and experienced what most have died trying or even thinking
of, may you always stay one step ahead of the &#147;game&#148;. To all others
who I fail to call by name it is not because I do not deem you worthy but
it is simply that my actions with you have either been limited or not all.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>I have never been very well at much except fighting, but through my time
here I have learned what it is to be a friend, I thank you for that experience.
For it was somewhat &#147;left out&#148; of my training in my home city of
Hate.</I>
