<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The day was hot and humid. The steam arising from the beautiful falls
of East Karana made it hard to breathe deep. Kimber wiped the sweat from
her smooth brow and looked at Morphite. "Are you ready for my help, wuss?"
she coyly replied, brushing the dangle of red hair from her eye.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Morphite calmly closed his book and struggled to stand upon his frail
legs. A slight smile as he pursed his lips in a short response, "Yes . .
." The response was half sigh, have spoken word. It was in Common, he didn't
want to confuse the lass by using anything more complex he mused.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The pair ran quickly, blessed of the wolf spirit, and came upon the prey
-- a stinky, half decaying reaver of the dead. The beast, no doubt raised
from the dead by the Split Claw necromancer that had slain Morphite only
a day earlier. The dark caster was the first morphite had seen in the area.
Most beasts were of melee capability only. But this one . . . he slew Morphite
with almost no trouble. In fact, Morphite's tale tells of a close battle,
lost only due to the multitudes of other creatures who aided in his defeat
. . . a lion, a spirit wolf, and of course, the dark one's pet. But that's
his redention of it, narely a bit of truth to it, I'm sure.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The two raised arms and books and began weaving colors of lights from
their hands. The shadows they played across the plains and trees was earie
but beautiful. Morphite's animation,carrying shield and axe, was surrounded
by thorns on his invisible body, and sped to a fervor. Morphite raised his
mug and saluted the creature by tearing at his ability to resist magiks.
The enraged beast stormed his way, arms flailing.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Calmly, the enchanter backed up and rooted the beast, it took! The next
magiks slowed the monsters movements and then attempted to choke whatever
air he may be breathing out of him. No doubt due to pure adrennelin, the
beast broke free of the root and attacked Morphite. Instantly the animation
was upon the reaver with a furor. Slash after slash tore into the beast,
but it didn't care . . . no, at the moment it wanted the frail enchanter
lying upon a pool of red on the plain. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The first blow drew blood from his chin and the second knocked Morphite
back. Unable to cast against the onslaught he attempted a feeble block.
Thankfully, slowed and weakened, Morphite was able to bewilder the creature
with a colorful spray and he withdrew from the melee. Quickly he made the
earth grab the creatures feet and while the animation slashed, he sat and
read . . .</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Morphite looked up from his book. The reaver was in sad shape. Unseen
thorns ripped at his hands as he clawed at the animation. He broke the earth
from his feet but didn't care about the enchanter any longer. The animation
had his full attention. Rotten flesh and dirty blood dripped from the animations
weapon and shield. Each piece of flesh hung on the invisible thorns that
Kimber had summoned. And then . . . it was over.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The beast's howl echoed across the plains. Morphite turned to smile at
Kimber, but she was gone. Off to find another victim no doubt . . . off to
continue the hunt for Morphite's sole benefit.</I>
