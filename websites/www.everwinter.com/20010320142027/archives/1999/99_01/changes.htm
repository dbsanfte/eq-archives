<I>As soon as he stepped through the dark portal, the gaping maw closed behind
him, leaving him in his magical home. He knew his face would start decaying
if it was not already starting. His body would soon be nothing but bones
and he couldn't afford to show those in the Conclave that he was a member
of the undead, not yet. Mumbling a single word, he created a black broad-rimmed
hat to cover his head. Pondering about what to cover his face with, he dipped
his hand into the shadows of his longcoat and withdrew a black scarf. After
putting on the scarf and the hat, only his eyes could be seen. Knowing his
eyes would eventually turn into red points, he decided to take off his
spectacles. This way, the others would know his transformation was finally
complete and his foes would think twice before attacking him. Grinning slightly
under the scarf, he walked about into his room, waiting for Megera to tell
him about the current events within the Conclave.</I>

<I>Raaz sat in the darkness, waiting. Waiting for his transformation to take
effect, waiting to see what he must live as. Most of his body had already
changed for he could no longer feel the pain which was surging within his
flesh a few days before. He began to record the events which he had gone
through in the book which he had acquired what seemed like lifetimes ago.
It was a thick tome covered with human skin in order to keep its magical
power. He recorded what had happened since he had found the book, he recorded
very little about himself, but more about his powers and what he could do
with it. He recorded it to remind himself that he wasn't always an undead
creature, but that he was once flesh and blood. <BR>

As he wrote the last part of his past, his vision faded into red. He no longer
had to use his magical spell in order to give him vision, but now his
transformation was complete. Raaz Hevenlaenn was no longer a creature that
was limited by mortality, he was now what most mortals would call a "Death
Knight."</I>
