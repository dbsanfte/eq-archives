	      <I>Balkin watched as the old sage tottered into the inn. Watched as the old
	      man peered around the common room, and settled his gaze on the scared Dwarven
	      warrior. Continued to watch as the man made his way to Balkin's table.</I>
	      <P ALIGN=Left>
	      <I>May ye sit? Aye, old one, sit down before ye fall down. That's quite a
	      sheaf o' paper ye have there, what is it yer after? What's that ye say? Me
	      story? What? Does not the map of scars all over me tell ye me story? I am
	      a warrior! That is my story!</I></TD>

	</TABLE>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Research ye say? Animation? What be that? Me? Bah, what need I of research,
	I need a sharp blade, and some good armor, that's what I need. &nbsp;Alright!
	Alright! Buy me an ale and be quiet. I'll tell the tale if ye'll leave me
	be afterward! I hope your old hands are firm enough to be writin' quick!
	I've nay much time before I must go and my armor still needs tending to!
	From the beginning? Very well, as I said, I've nay much time but here it
	is.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Me father says he had no idea where I came from. He was workin the forge,
	deep inside Kaladim, and suddenly a bitter cold wind blew through the smithy,
	extinguishing the forge! Can ye believe it!?! Hundreds of feet underground!
	In the aftermath, he says he found me on the floor by the anvil. Quiet I
	was, but not for long. Me mother says she's never seen a Dwarf ask so many
	questions. From the moment I could talk, she says she had nary a moments
	rest or quiet! He he he. The more things change the more things stay the
	same! I still talk to much, which is why I'm talkin ta you instead o' cleanin
	me armor. My parents? Nay, they are no my true parents, though I honor them
	as such.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>What's this about a blade? Ye know the way's of the Dwarves I see. Yes
	I was given a weapon before I could walk. Me father said it were like this.
	He handed me a dagger ta see how I might handle it. Firm was my grip, says
	he. But the fun part o' this is that he says it took him ten minutes to get
	the blade away from me! Says I gave him several nasty cuts in the process!
	Is that normal? Nay, now that you mention it, it is not. Most will hold the
	blade, nay many will take a swipe with it. T'was then he says, that he knew
	I would fight. Then it was, that he knew I would become a warrior.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Did I excel at my training? Aye, the best of the lot I was. There's nothing
	like the whistle of a blade through the air, nor the feel of steel crunching
	into the flesh of your enemies. Are you all right old one? Barkeep! Water
	for the sage! He seems a might distraught! My circle? Aye, you do indeed
	know much old one. I have reached my 20th circle. An achievement you say?
	Maybe, but to me it is another step in a long journey, one that only true
	death can complete.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Now where was I. Ah, indeed, me father said I was not for the guards,
	I was for the world. Me first job was assigned by the Warriors guild master
	himself, The mountains surrounding Kaladim are infested with foul goblins,
	bats, and magic'ed skeletons. Twas my duty to clean them away from the main
	gate of Kaladim so that travelers might be safe. Did it go well? Aye, well
	indeed. I'd show ye the scars from those first days, but I can no find them
	amongst the others Ha ha ha. Ye want to see the whole map? Ha ha. Nay? Right,
	probably not a good idea. Barkeep! More water for the old one! Yes, I'll
	buy it!</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>From there I traveled the roads to the Elven lands, escorting travelers
	and helping all as I may. From the Elven lands, I found my way to Crushbone.
	Aey, ye've heard of the place I see. A haven of foul, evil Orcs it be. I
	met many worthy spell casters and warriors there, and together we did our
	best to kill them all! Alas, Orcs breed faster than rabbits it seems, they
	are unending! However, I earned my reputation there. The Orcs of Crushbone
	have declared me a Villain! Har! I can think o' no better compliment! Ha
	ha!</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Then onward I traveled to the Steamfont Mountains. A journey that be,
	yes. The gnome have many strange and wonderous devices. I was mightily impressed,
	though they are a bit strange at times. Some o' those clockworks now.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>How did I get here from there? By me feet and the boat! How else!? Freeport
	be the largest city known to all. Where else does a warrior go for work,
	besides to a city? I've traveled most of the known world. I've been both
	a mercinary, and a personal guard. What? Why do I not stay in any one place?
	Nay, I'm not angry at ye, tis a good question. I can no answer it. I've a
	drive to go. a drive to see. I seek something, yet I know not what. I know
	only that I will know what I seek when I find it.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>What's that? Again with the animations. Aye, ye know much old one, but
	ye know not all. Dhirge say ye? I should speak with him?</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Balkin downed his ale, then another while listening to the old one talk.
	Pictures, diagrams, and text rolled forth from the stack of paperwork the
	old sage possessed. Most of it ancient, much of it spoke of the Winterborne,
	and those who lead them. Dhirge was one of these, and had to be either as
	old as eternity, or a decendant from the first Dark Elf of that name, mentioned
	long ago.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Aye old one, it seems I might be going that way soon anyway, I've a job
	guarding a caravan that is headed that way. Mayhap I'll seek him out. How
	do you know all this old man? Ah, now ye keep secrets! Ye pry my life outta
	me then have no answers to my questions!? Har Har Har! This is to much. get
	ye gone old one, I've armor to tend to and provisions to buy, tis time for
	my journey to continue!</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Aye, Aye I'll seek out this Dhirge. If for no reason than to keep you
	quiet! Go now and let me rest a few moments more. Armor be heavy ye know,
	even for a dwarf!</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>A short while later, clad in his armor, a sword on each hip and a pack
	on his back, Balkin clomped down into the inn commons. None would meet his
	eyes as he glared around. There was something about an armored warrior that
	made people stare at their cups instead of the one in armor. That was fine.
	&nbsp;He would return here someday, remove his armor, and sit in the commons
	listening to and telling stories like all the others. He had no doubt those
	present would remember him. Scarred faces are often remembered, he knew
	that.</I>
