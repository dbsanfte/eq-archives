<I>Stumbling down the pass from High Keep, Lady Trespare wept tears of bitter
shame. The coming darkness mirrored her mood. "Why? By all the Lady's Grace,
Why?" her voice cracked as she quickly limped onward to retrieve her belongings.
The scenes kept running through her mind, blazing themselves deeper into
her soul and blighting her memories. The thought that she could hunt with
Lord Keldore was a welcome change. He was not often about when she was, and
she truly wished to aid him and herself in learning the ways of magic and
power. But from the first, thier pairing was a disasterous one. They set
off to hunt the deadly crags of the plains, only to find themselves outnumbered
by several other creatures while they faced the spider. Lord Keldore was
able to summon his wizardly magic and disappear in a swirling silver cloud.
She had yelled at him to go, and faced the beasts alone, laying down her
sword and life so that he could have time to summon his magic and retreat.
Upon reawakening with her Gods blessing, and finding Lord Keldore again,
they set off for another try, only to be brought low again. Another run of
the foul plains beasts set upon them, and this time her sword and magic was
not enough. Blue-white magic flew from her hands and trailed about him, her
axe and scimitar sung in the air they moved so quickly to strike the crag
down, but it was nae enough. Shivering from poison and weakened by the effort,
he gave a brief cry and fell into his God's arms. Pouring all her rage into
her movements, she soon slew the spider that had felled him and dropped next
to his body with tears running from her eyes." I am sorry Lord, so sorry!
My honor is broken, my shame complete. May Tunare take me in payment for
thy life!" In the midst of her weeping, a dark stalker, hearing prey near,
set upon her. Holding her gaping wounds, she could only sigh in sorrow as
the last life bled from her and she was whisked once again to the nether
realms. </I>
