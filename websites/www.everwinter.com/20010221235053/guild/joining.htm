	  <I>Our House is rather selective about who we accept. Class, race, and level
	  have little bearing, but our mission calls for energetic role-players who
	  can function as mature team-players, keeping the interests of the guild in
	  mind. If you don&#146;t enjoy enacting your character (role-playing), you&#146;d
	  be best&nbsp;off finding another guild more to your liking. </I>

	  <I>An animation is not to be confused with the enchanter creation that bears
	  the same name. The term was applied to Winter&#146;s second generation of
	  artificial life. Following the completion of similaricrum, creatures fashioned
	  in the shape of others by made from snow and ice, Winter managed to mirror
	  life in all important ways.</I>
	  <P ALIGN=Center>
	  <I>Winter&#146;s children, or animations, are not golems or automatons. They
	  have free will, living and dying like any other mortal race. They tend to
	  be superior members of the races they are fashioned after, though they possess
	  no unnatural abilities. Their personalities are their own. &nbsp;Beyond what
	  the rest of the world might think of an animation, they are impossible to
	  detect without magical devices fashioned in Winter&#146;s time. Even these
	  artifacts cannot unerringly detect the presence of one of Winter&#146;s
	  children.</I>

		<I>Over the last few years, both generations of Winter&#146;s creations have
		begun to fail. The cause is unknown. Lady Vox&#146;s similaricrums (ice goblins
		and ice giants) suffer more frequently than the second generation, but all
		can be affected. Malfunctions manifest in a myriad of ways, ranging from
		simple pain mimicking mundane arthritis, to acute headaches, blindness, failing
		organs, paralysis, or death. Madness is not unknown.</I>
		<P ALIGN=Center>
		<I>House Winterborne works to discover the reason for these malfunctions
		and, when they achieve that, a cure.</I></TD>
