<FONT COLOR="#8080ff"><I>ag'Talisman - Sunday January 3, 1999 </I></FONT>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Talisman flew toward Grand Master Jabbuk's lair. As he flew his eyes searched
the ground. High above the rocky hills belonging to the copper celares he
glimpsed a form lying below. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He banked and circled. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>*Fagan?* he thought then plummented down to his friend. Flaring his wings
he halted his fall. Shifting his half-elven seeming as his feet touched the
ground.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He checked her pulse. Cursing silently, Talisman unsheathed Caliburn and
searched the area. *No one, only a few boulders and rocks*. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Bending down he carrassed Fagan's bloody face. *Someone is going pay for
this outrage but first I will do what I can for Fagan.*</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>His other hand drove Caliburn into the ground. It parted stones and sliced
through rocks. Talisman knelt and placed Fagan's head his lap. Stroking her
hair he started the spell.</I>
<P ALIGN=Center>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Serle waited. Talisman's eyes could not see him as long remained part
of the shadows. He left the shadows and watched. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>All of Talisman's concentration was be focused on the spell. He crept
up and slide the collar around Talisman's neck. </I>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<I><IMG SRC="bar.gif" WIDTH="510" HEIGHT="19" BORDER="0" ALIGN="Middle"></I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<FONT COLOR="#8080ff"><I>Serle - Tuesday January 5, 1999: </I></FONT>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Serle slipped the torc around Talisman neck. A brillant silver light flashed
as the spell took effect. Serle's laughter boomed as Talisman's own spell
ruined. He rolled his eyes when Talisman fought the torc's influence. He
knew. Talisman's battle was lost. It was useless to resist. The torc was
created using the same principles and magic as the dragon orbs. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Long ago, Talisman was held under the torc's spell. It would not any different
today. HIS father owned Talisman. It was fitting that Elwin Whitelock's son
inherit his father's belongings. Yes, indeed he would have all of his
inheritance. This miserable creature had stolen his father's love from him.
It was his fate to even the balance.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Toad". Serle said.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Talisman's form blurred. It refocused into a giant toad. Serle laughed.
"Good, my slave. Human, open a portal home".</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Talisman shifted to human form. Dark hair, hazel eyes stared lifelessly
at the world. His hands wove the air. Time and space latered and stretched
until they split apart. A portal stood before them.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Dragon, you will take me home".</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Talisman shifted to his true form. Held out claw and gently raised Serle
to his back. Wings flared out and they lifted. Entering the portal which
abruptly closed. </I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Solon took Fagan advice. He had a cot brought to Aidan's room and was
prepared to sleep on it. Before going to sleep he looked at Aidan. She was
silent, so silent. Bowen and Fagan stated it was a matter of time before
she would wake. Be patient they advised. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He was tired of being patient. He could not help shake the feeling that
something was going to happen. They were balanced on a pinnacle and he could
not tell which way they would fall. Casting his troubles to IO. Solon drifted
to sleep.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>His eyes closed.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"TALISMAN!" Aidan screamed.... </I>
