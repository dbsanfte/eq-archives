<I>The sun gleaming down, warming the scales upon his back; his wings gently
beating a pulse through the air, their tips lifting and brushing the mist
of the clouds; the horror of seeing dragon killing dragon; his heart and
soul shriveling within him as he fled from Pinnacle, the perfect city in
the sky. If not for cz&#146;Olam, he would have gone mad. All of these things
ag&#146;Saidar now remembered, and more&#133;<BR>
<BR>
Many years earlier&#133;<BR>
<BR>
The sun beat down on the fields of the Western Karanas, waves of heat making
the horizon shimmer. The young boy Saidaar shielded his eyes with his hand
as he strode back to his family&#146;s farm. His father had entrusted him
with taking some axes to Ironforge&#146;s for sharpening. He was eager to
prove himself up to the task, and did not even pause at the Miller&#146;s
farm to say hello to Tiny, instead edging around the outskirts of their farm
until he reached his family&#146;s fields.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>As he crested a small rise, the bile rose in his throat as he viewed the
remains of his home. Small tendrils of smoke rose lazily from piles of ashes
here and there. His parents lay where they had fallen, their blood soaking
the dry dirt beneath them. The bandits that haunted the Karanas had once
again taken their toll.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Neclo Rheslar found Saidaar wandering in Qeynos Hills. He took the boy
to Qeynos and handed him over to the care of his friend Lashun Novashine,
a priest of Rodcet Nife. Lashun and his fellow clerics lovingly tended the
incoherent lad.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The years passed. Saidaar&#146;s memories of his previous world were becoming
clearer, sharper, adding more pain to that which he had already suffered.
The clerics at the Temple of Life tried to persuade him to become a cleric
like them. Saidaar refused. Although he knew he was capable of caring greatly,
he could not meet their demands that he care for all mankind, including those
he thought unworthy. And no matter how much he loved Lashun and his brothers
in Rodcet Nife, Saidaar could not forswear the bitterness in his heart. He
took his leave of them and sought out cz&#146;Olam, the one man he considered
his brother. Together they joined the Conclave of the Wyrm, in which there
was several other fellow Dragons.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Saidaar began to study magic in preparation of the revenge he was planning.
His body, already more muscular than the typical mage due to his childhood
of hard farm labor, was honed and made more agile and deft by the hours he
spent in the Karanas spying upon the bandits, emerald grin eyes slitted in
hatred as he studied their habits and weaknesses. His patience grew as he
watched the bandits and awaited his mastery of gatecalling, slowly learning
how to summon and command the forces of the elements.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>One day he felt himself ready. Arming himself with a backpack of summoned
food, water, and bandages, he called forth his most powerful magic and commanded
the earth itself to take form and obey his orders. Saidaar spent the next
several years hunting the bandits, slaying them one by one, taunting them
as he imagined they had taunted his parents. Eventually his bitterness was
purged, leaving his heart nothing more than a lump of sadness lying within
his chest.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>When he thought of what he had once been, disappointment welled up in
his throat, taking away his breath. The insignificant magic of dissolving
and transporting his body through space to a single pre-determined destination
was the closest that he could come to flying again. It was a poor substitute
for the glory that had once been his.<BR>
Upon reaching the Twentieth Circle of magic, ag&#146;Saidar now Saidaar of
Norrath chose the surname of Silverwyrm in honor of his heritage. The seasons
passed and he continued to grow in strength and knowledge. And then he stared
into another pair of emerald green eyes.</I>
