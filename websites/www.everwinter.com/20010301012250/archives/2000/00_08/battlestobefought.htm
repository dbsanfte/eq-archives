<I>Peony glanced over her shoulder and out the window to where her husband,
Dolgo, was making the last minute arrangements for their mounts. She was
frustrated, tired, and more than a little nervous about the upcoming journey
that would change their lives forever. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Her brave and stout Dolgo... dressed as he was for battle, she couldn't
help but wonder if they were making the right decision. It had been but three
days since Rackin had mysteriously disappeared, and only two since the Call
to Arms for all hobbits and their allies to return to Rivervale.. The Tier'Dal
were advancing it seemed, somehow they had come up with majiks that allowed
them to creep through Kithicor undetected.. even by the undead armies that
had been plagueing that blasted wood since time out of mind.. Dolgo and Peony
had spoken long into the night when they first received the missive.. their
first thoughts of course were that Rackin had gone to join the Teir'Dal armies..
that Najena had once again worked her spell on him.. Peony and Dolgo had
so wanted to give Rackin the benefit of the doubt however.. to believe that
he had simply fled from the propaganda that was sure to have reached his
ears.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Whatever the case may have been.. they both firmly felt that they had
to return to the place of their birth and stand alongside their relatives
against the hideous foe. They made plans to tie up their affairs in Kunark
and return to Antonica. It took them just one full day and evening to procur
the needed supplies.. Dolgo had made one last forage out into the mountains..
gathering his poison componants. Peony had wandered, almost in a daze behind,
gathering the few rare herbs that might assist her in her healing. Mostly
she meditated and read her psalms, gathering energy for what was to be a
long and dangerous path. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She watched as Dolgo gave a sharp nod to the stable boy, dropping a healthy
amount of gold into his surprised paw.. with a snort she returned her attention
to paying the lass behind the bar, handing over almost three times what the
beer and board had cost. Knowing that she had caught the ladies attention,
she pulled from her pack one of four identical notes.. The missives were
written on cured hide and then closed from prying eyes with her own personal
wax seal. She waved the rolled leather before the womans nose.. "I'll pay
ye more than this if ye promise tae hand this over tae anyone that bears
the same crest that looks like this..\\v//&#167;\\v//... Specifically a woman
that can identify herself as Rhianna, "Queen" of Winterborne.. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The woman snatched the missive out of Peony's hand and quickly tucked
it up onto a shelf behind the bar with promises to see that it was properly
delivered. Peony, fairly dubious about the womans "good" intentions saw fit
to hand the promised coin over anyway.. She then shouldered her pack and
made her way from the bar out to where the laden beasts and her husband awaited
her. </I>

<I>Along the journey towards home, three more of the same missive were
distributed.. most, thankfully to trusted hands.. Peony and Dolgo both knew
that they could count on the letters making it to the right people.. </I>

<I>Dear Rianna and Winterborne,</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>I trust that this finds you in good health and high spirits. It is with
a saddened heart however that Dolgo and I do not bring the best of news.
War has called us home and after searching our hearts we've realized that
what Winterborne once meant to us.. is no more. Those that we truly called
family, those that we knew and loved have perished, become lost, or simply
faded away from the "Clan". We wish for there to be no hard feelings and
hope that should we survive our battle, a friendship can be maintained..

<I>The note was worn a bit from the deliver's handling, yet still carried
the sad words on it's surface. Rianna had pinned the note to the wall with
a sword, posted with such force, that the sword was near burried to the hilt.
Apparently it had not made her day go any better, he mused.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Noticing a sheet of parchment was nearby, the enchanter decided to make
use of it as a way to bless the couple on their way.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Little one, your gifts and cheer were always welcome and I'm sorry I
did not get to know you better. I know my Lord Olam knew you and cared deeply
for your cause. Should you find need for aid in the defense of your home,
I'm sure the woodelf could be persuaded . . . as for me . . . scrolls of
spells not researched are payment enough for me, count me to your side!
