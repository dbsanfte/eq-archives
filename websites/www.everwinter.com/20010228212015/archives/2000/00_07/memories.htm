<I>So much pain, so much agony&#133; The blistering heat and sticky humidity
of the land seeped into her pores and threatened to bake her insides like
the rabbit meat she had hung on a spit over the fire. It's spitting and popping
resounded in her ears, causing a throbbing headache to form behind her
eyes.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Rianna sat far back from the fire, closer to the lake's edge in the hopes
that the water would cool the slight wind blowing in from the hills and somehow
ease her discomfort as well. The tall mountains on all sides of the lake
seemed to keep in the heat, though each was covered with snow at its peak.
Her sparkling green eyes were red around the edges from the dirt and dust
stirred up as she hunted. Closing them briefly she lay back against the stone
pillar she had chosen to camp near and sighed with pent up tension.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>How many in the Clans knew her? She did not know. Only her Brother, the
dark one was here and much the same it seemed. Yet, even he, so often her
support in the Lands before, could not help her here. Alone. The knowledge
struck her deeply. Outcast and Alone. What must one soul endure for the sake
of Honor? What price would one pay for that un-definable essence? Leaning
forward, Rianna cupped her hands to her head and let her tears cleanse her
eyes of grit.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Lord Knight Amabala, the Fallen One, had helped her earlier in the day.
He came upon her in battle, and forced the Sunark Knight to fall back before
her so that she might call upon the magics within her to char his thin skin.
She had nodded her thanks and proceeded to spend a few moments speaking to
him before finding her way once more. His path often followed hers it seemed.
Rianna knew how hard it must have been for him to watch Trespare transformed.
To see one's love give her body for another is no easy task. The full impact
of her change had not yet registered to him. She walked the lands as a Cleric
now, having taken the body of Mindari in the last battle. It was as difficult
for her as it was for him to accept.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Rianna brushed the tracks of dirt from her cheeks and opened her eyes
to the light of the fading sun. She would survive. The Abyss and the Void
held no mystery for her. She had walked in them for too many years with despair
in her heart and agony in her soul. She was harder now, older now, wiser
now. Reaching into her bear skin backpack, she pulled a small leather bound
book from it and rubbed her thumb absently over the inscribed title. </I>

<I>"Rianna Blisterclaw-Neverwinter Journal"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Sinking back into her memories, Rianna opened the book to the first page
and began to read&#133;.</I>

<I>The Winds..so often have I felt them upon my scales and under my wings,
that they merge with the etting sun and the verdant forest below to make
one seemingly whole vision. What would I be without the winds of the world?
It cradles me as a lover would, supports me as my mate, twines about my form
no matter which I take and drives itself into my lungs, giving me life. As
I breathe the very essence of the land I remember my Clan and the reason
I am here. The knowledge brings some joy to me in these days of harshness.
The Dragon Council is formed and I am one with my kind once more. How long
must each of us wander to find a home? The lands of men fear us, yet allow
us to walk amongst them in form. Some are more curious than most, and some
of course, too respectful to be true to the callings they proclaim. In the
end however, the Halls of the Council call me..my duty calls me...my family
calls at last. What price will we pay for it? I cannot say now. Perhaps in
the blank pages that follow my journal will reveal it at last, and I can
only hope the price is not too high. For now, the wind beckons and I spread
myself upon it, reveling in the freedom of the moment, and the embrace of
life it gives, the promise of eternity...</I>

<I>The long flowing script continued, flowing across the parchment like a
river of ink, filled with all kinds of interesting and strange things below
it's surface&#133;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>WhiteLeopard introduced me to the Council Master, the one who calls himself
the will of Io. This I hardly believe. He is young, upstart, and overblown
in his power. A rival faction of humans in the town of Neverwinter have
challenged him for power in some test of skill, though I know not what it
is. His name is Greatwyrm, though tis hardly fitting of one so obviously
ill suited for power. How did he pull the dragons of this realm together?
I do not know, save that as Dragons, we ourselves, have a need. To belong,
to be aided, to have a home here amongst those who would fear us. Our
preservation is at stake; the lands are filled with all manner of evil. There
are those in the lands, even now, who are as we are. Dragons, all colors,
and they do not even know it. Foul magic was at work here to drive them into
the human form and leave them to fend alone. I sense somehow it is my duty
to find them, to bring them home as I was brought. Only together can we prevail
against this foul deed wrought by&#133;..Who? Perhaps the more of our kind
we find, the more the answer will become clear. Let us hope, against the
odds, that there is more of us to prevail this time. I would not like to
believe I have found my true self once more, only to lose it again.</I>
