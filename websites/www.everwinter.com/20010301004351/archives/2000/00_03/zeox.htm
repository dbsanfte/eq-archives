<I>A storm was brewing over the digging site, soon the entire area would
be engulfed into the darkness of it&#146;s wraith, the dwarven workers could
see it was no ordinary storm, but it only made them work faster. The huge
tent was just over a hill where they could overlook the site and see everything
down below, inside two dark elves were awaiting patiently but it was wearing
quite thin as the minutes pressed on. The smaller of the two was sitting
down at the desk drumming his thin frail fingers on the desk repeatedly in
irritation, the other paced the ground behind him obviously aggravated. A
small gnome poked his head into the tent before he came all the way inside
&#147;Me tinks dey mite &#145;ave found sumtin Massers, lease dat wat dey
tel ol hobblefoot &#145;ere. Me say it jes a &#145;ole in da groun tho.&#148;
For a gnome he spoke rather slow, he remembered the last time he spoke fast
and had to repeat himself 5 times before his masters became irritated,
that&#146;s where he gained the scars upon his chest. <BR>
<BR>
&#147;Very well Hob, I will check on it myself after I gather some things,
but it&#146;s probly yet another false alarm. Xal take hobs with you and
make sure that none of the dwarves enter the site and make sure they don&#146;t
leave either, while I check things out, we might need them yet.&#148; The
pacing dark elf stopped and nodded, he grabbed Hobblefoot by the scruff and
carried towards the door of the tent. <BR>
<BR>
&#147;WAIT! WAIT! MASSER JYNTARI! DEY FOUND BONES!! BONES ME SAYS! BIG OL
BONES BOUT SIZE O DRAGON!&#148; The gnome shouted out as he was carried off
away from the tent.<BR>
Jyntari cracked a grin for a moment then started gathering some things from
his desk and left the tent heading for the site. <BR>
He arrived at the place where the dwarves had been digging it wasn&#146;t
hard to find a huge hole covered in bones, massive bones obviously bones
of dragons one with even a little knowledge of dragons could tell. Seeing
the bones lying there brought a smile to his face, it was a good sign to
him that he was close, very close. He chanted a few words of arcane lore
and in a moment&#146;s time the bones danced through the air as if they had
their own will and moved to the side of the hole, uncovering the stairway
leading down into the caverns below. Cautiously he went down the stairway
looking to the sides, he saw ancient writings upon the walls mostly warnings
of those who dared enter the tome of the ever sleeping dragons. He paid no
mind to them and continued on, he knew his way around and wouldn&#146;t encounter
any mishaps here. It was 2 years ago to this day that he started receiving
the visions of all things known. At first it worried him to hear and see
these visions but soon after he came to realize that without those visions
he wouldn&#146;t have become as strong as he did in the arcane arts. He owed
this entity a great deal of debt and he intended to pay that debt back. He
made his way through the maze with no trouble, other then the rats and a
few insects there wasn&#146;t another living being around and the undead
didn&#146;t seem to bother him at all. He entered into a huge room, in the
center of the room was a very large crypt sealed shut, an orb hovered just
above the crypt lid. The orb was a solid silver color mark with a symbol
that escaped Jyntari&#146;s knowledge. He reached into his pouch and pulled
out a gray filled orb and held it up to the tome. &#147;At last I have found
you my liege, all is well we are prepared to free your spirit from that which
has held you for so long and return you to this world in a new seeming.&#148;
He spoke in a low unemotional tone. <BR>
<BR>
The orb emitted a dim glow as the voice came from it. &#147;I know you have
traveled far to find me and I have followed you in your learning&#146;s,
you have become a very strong and wise student of the arcane arts Jyntari.&#148;
<BR>
<BR>
&#147;Yes, you have taken very good care of me through my training, and I
am forever grateful to you as your loyal servant. Xalbraxus is on his way
with the others whom have pledge their allegiance to you along side of me,
soon you will be among us.&#148; Just as Jyntari finished his sentence Xalbraxus
entered the tome with another mage and two clerics. Xalbraxus stepped forward
&#147;We left the warriors outside fleeing they had no part in this step
of the process.&#148; Jyntari nodded in agreement. &#147;Place the gray orb
near the silver one above my tome, with your strength combined with mine
the seal should give way.&#148; Jyntari did as
instructed&#133;&#133;&#133;<BR>
<BR>
The half elf awoke in his bed he was weak but what would you expect after
being reincarnated. He sat up in the bed and stretched his sore muscles,
the new seeming wasn&#146;t actually that bad to him he rather liked it although
he would miss his old one very much. He got out of bed and walked out into
the main chambers, the guard outside bowed to him, he nodded in
acknowledgement.<BR>
<BR>
&#147;Jyntari is in the council room with the others they have collected
the data you requested.&#148; The guard replied.<BR>
<BR>
In the council chambers everyone rose and bowed slightly to their lord.
&#147;Lord Vega I see you have awaken from your rest everything go well?
It pleases me to see you have recovered, we have the information you requested
for us. It seems that those you have inquired about are alive and well roaming
through the lands known as Norrath.&#148; Jyntari pleased with his findings
grinned at his lord.<BR>
<BR>
&#147;Very well Jyntari, and lady Shar?&#148; he chuckled as his last memory
of the pale lady was crashing into her in mid flight, everything else is
mostly a blur in his mind but of everything and everyone Shar he remembered
clearly. He was anxious to meet up with the pale lady once
again.<BR>
<BR>
&#147;Lady Shar is also traveling in Norrath, Shall we make arrangements
to leave as soon as possible?&#148; <BR>
<BR>
&#147;Yes, once again you havent failed me my loyal servant. I wish for you
and Xalbraxus to join me there in norrath I will need your skills on my side
while we explore a new world and for my own reasons you will know me as Zeox
there&#148; Jyntari nodded in agreement and bowed as Vega left the council
room&#133;</I>

<I>The half-elf stirred in his bed, sweat had formed massively over his brow,
it was the makings of a nightmare. <BR>
<BR>
When he awoke he knew what he needed to do and so he went on to Surefall
Glades, home of the rangers of norrath.<BR>
<BR>
"Is it right to accept him Hager, it isnt like us."<BR>
<BR>
"However that may be, we are not permitted to deny him his rank amogst us,
his beleifs are simular and that is well enough."<BR>
<BR>
"Very well guildmaster."<BR>
<BR>
Hager came out of the log cabin where the meeting had taken place, he looked
over to Vega and nodded.<BR>
<BR>
"You have been accepted, do not get us wrong your beliefs are border ling
to ours, it is only for your reputation as a bard that proceeds you in Black
Burrow, that's what swung the decision in your favor. Now choose a name for
your rebirth into our ranks young ranger."<BR>
<BR>
Vega smiled he knew he wouldnt have been denied...all that hard work in Black
Burrow had payed off. There was only one name that came to him, it had been
in his mind for several days and was the cause of all his
nightmares.<BR>
<BR>
"I shall be known as Vage Darkwinds within these ranks." he said with a
grin.<BR>
<BR>
"Very well Vage, make us proud in these lands."<BR>
<BR>
Vage nodded and walked from surefall glades, he sat down next to the waters.
While being a bard had it's advantages he just couldnt fill the shoes.
<BR>
<BR>
*singing and dancing around like a fairy, shameful to this old Shadow dragon.
I am only grateful that Shar never saw me doing such, I'd never hear the
end of it...never*<BR>
<BR>
"And so I shall be named Vage Darkwinds, newborn ranger of norrath, what
will the old bronze Olam have to say" he chuckled to himself
softly.<BR>
<BR>
*Vage...a name I have been hearing in my head since I escaped that afterdeath
abyss. The nightmares...the incoherent thoughts that ring in my head...the
storms. Ah the storms, the one thing that held me together in that dimension.
They werent made for what they gave me, I'm sure, but they gave me tranquility.
Of course I paid the price, but I got out before any real damage could have
been done. My life has changed...perhaps intensified while I was there, I
gained much from that experience. My only worry is this...this conscience
I have gained, but I'm lucky that's all there is I could have ended up
like...like the Earl!!* <BR>
He winced at the thought of being an Earl clone...he could just see himself
sitting next to Johan in their highly polished armor sipping tea and laughing
at the Earl's boring ongoing stories, yet he missed the old paladin even
though he was on the opposite side of the pendalim as Vega he was still
considered a comrade, a friend, and yes even a brother. <BR>
<BR>
"Well enough reflections on past memories, I must get started on my training
if I am to make it in these lands." <BR>
<BR>
He stood up from his resting place only to be jumped by a skeleton roaming
the lands too close to the newborn ranger....</I>
