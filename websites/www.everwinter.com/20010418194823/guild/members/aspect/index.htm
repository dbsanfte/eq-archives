	      <I>The very heart of goodness in Felwithe, Feldar N&#146;Viathon had ruled
	      his land with an iron fist for nearly four centuries. He was a strict but
	      fair high elven lord, demanding honesty, repaying treachery with death. He
	      had risen to power by war, and his life comprised armies and assassins, taxes
	      and laws. Beneath the grim gray weight of these thousand duties, Feldar was
	      growing old.</I></TD>

	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> Then came Celeste. The nearly dead soul of Feldar was revived; his dusty
	heart began to beat again. Celeste awoke in him hope, the hope of the youth
	and happiness he had so willingly squandered. And she awoke in him desire
	&#150; raised his spirit to empyrean heights so that when he fell, he fell
	like a meteor.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> Feldar led his armies to a new world, one of which none had seen the
	likes of. Within these new lands, Feldar fell victim to the likes of the
	unnatural things that inhabited the new lands&#133; As his armies returned
	home, Celeste was devastated at the news of her beloved. Her heart wept for
	she had not even had the opportunity to let Feldar know that he was to be
	a father&#133;</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> Raised on the caring hands of his mother, and the stories and legends
	of his father, Aspect soon reached adolescence, and had to decide whether
	to follow in his fathers footsteps and become a Holy Warrior as his father
	before him, or follow his desires and heart to further his studies in the
	arcane arts (of which he had kept private and personal up to this point).
	Upon notifying his mother of his decision to further his studies in the arcane
	arts, she was supportive of course, but he knew there was a part of her that
	held disappointment as well. His heart was filled with anxiety, as he knew
	the disappointment she was feeling now was only a small impression of what
	was to come.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> When Aspect renounced his right of heir, the countryside was shocked
	and dismayed at his decision. He had given up what most could only dream
	of ever having. He knew in his heart though, that he could not properly care
	for his country and its people and continue his studies. He arranged for
	his mother to retain her status with the N&#146;Viathon house until she walked
	this realm no more. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>When his studies became hindered, he decided he had no more to learn in
	his own country. At this time, he left his country and home, never to return.
	His mother wept.</I>
