	      <I>A small silver bird, a hybrid created by his father, sat on the sill of
	      one of four windows in his bedroom, chirping lightly to Jaidon. Jaidon smiled
	      at his small friend and dotted the air around the bird in sparkles. "My friend,
	      I must say, your songs become more enchanting everyday. I'm afraid, however,
	      that this is the last time for a good while that I will hear them. I depart
	      with my father this evening." The bird's song became slower and heavier,
	      and it eventually took wing. It did not want to hear of his leaving again.</I></TD>

	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Jaidon then pushed himself from the sill and took a glance around the
	spacious room. He would miss the large villa in the secluded, wooden valley
	near the city of RhyDin. He would miss the view over the glittering lake
	from his window. He would miss the Red Dragon Inn and its sultry barmaids
	and shady patrons. Shaking his head of these thoughts, he ran his hands over
	the smooth oak door. It closed.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>He had released himself of his material possessions in this world. He
	was told that he could not take anything to Norrath with him. Earlier in
	the week, he had bid his very few true friends fond farewells. He had one
	more task to accomplish before he could go. He made his way to the comfortable
	common room. His father sat there, beside his mother.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"Can't you two keep your hands off each other for a second?" Jaidon laughed
	as he jibbed his father. "Do you really want another one?" His mirth hid
	his regret.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"Just you wait, Jaidon. I'm going to feed you to an ogre the second we
	set foot in Norrath. She will not be able to help you there." The two grinned,
	Vahnna did not.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"Old man, if you do anything to harm our son while you two traipse that
	damned realm, I'll make it so you'll never have another one!" She pinched
	his arm, hard. "Get over here, you, and hug me before you slay me with worry."
	</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Jaidon slipped onto the couch at her other side and wrapped his thin--yet
	toned--arms around his mother.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"Well, it's time for us to be going." The elder Silverwand stood, the
	younger following suit. Keldore kissed his wife passionately, as usual, and
	then released her to the couch where she sighed. She did not want either
	of them going off. Jaidon was about to offer another snide remark, when his
	father turned to him. "Your sure about this?"</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>His reply was a mere nod. Jaidon had been preparing himself to follow
	his father to the land of Norrath for a good many months. He had only asked
	this of his parents a week ago, and so he had plenty of time to consider
	the matter and decide. He was sure, and he thought he was ready.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Saying good-bye to Vahnna again, the two left the common room and went
	to Keldore's laboratory in the East wing of the villa. The room was dark,
	save for a tiny globe that illuminated a large mirror on the far wall. The
	mirror itself was unadorned, and seemed to be nothing but a common reflecting
	glass. It was the only artifact in the room that was used on any consistent
	basis. This was where the four feet carried the two Silverwands.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"Remember, Jaidon, Norrath's magic is unlike anywhere else. It is incompatible
	with my own for the most part. This mirror will get you there, but exactly
	where and in what condition is anyone's guess. Where ever you end up, seek
	out the nearest city and enroll in the enchanter's guild if you can. You
	seem to be inclined that that discipline, and at least that should be consistent
	between worlds. Then, seek myself or any one of House Winterborne out. We'll
	get you settled into Qeynos to begin your training." </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Jaidon's reply again was merely a nod. His excitement would allow no
	words.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>The last thing that Jaidon remembered in his former world was a sensation
	of falling into a white mist.</I>
