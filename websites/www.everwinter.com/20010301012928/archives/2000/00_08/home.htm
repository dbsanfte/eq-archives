<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin stood near the front of the ship with his helmet off, enjoying
the brisk breeze flowing off the ocean of tears. He was going home. Not to
his guild home of Qeynos, but to his birth home, Kaladim. The grin on his
face caused several of the sailors manning the ship to shake their heads,
as they went about their business. Though, perhaps they were shaking their
heads at his armored form. What fool wore plate mail armor on board a ship!!!???
The axe alone was enough to sink anyone, no matter how strong they thought
they were.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin ignored them. The breeze was grand, and his heart was lifted, as
the mountainous shore of his homeland came into sight. The Shout from the
docks of "B O A T !!!" brought a chuckle to the scared warriors throat. Such
an event this was, to those waiting for the ship.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>As he jogged down the dock, a blue skinned aqua goblin ran ashore and
started attacking some of the youngsters there! The cold fury that took over
him was shocking! THIS is why warriors wear armor. With narry a thought,
Balkin lept off the end of the dock, and thudded down onto the sand of the
shore. With a Battle Roar, his axe was swinging before he had even had time
to stand up fully. His first strike was the telling blow in this battle.
Obviously, a critical wound, the axe chopped into the neck and shoulder of
the goblin. His second blow was nearly as strong, as the blade bit deep into
the goblin's side. The blue skinned creature tried to stagger away to it's
watery home, but the flurry of blows from the youngsters, and the resounding
"Thunk" of his axe ramming home for the third time ended the goblins run.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>With a deep angry growl, he wrenched his blade from the goblins back,
and tested the edge. It was then he noticed how quiet it was. The group around
him had all dropped to one knee, and then bowed towards him, before running
for the boat. Elves, every one of them, but showing proper respect, when
it is earned. "A good lot", Balkin mumbled to himself, as he checked the
small purse the goblin carried. Bah, only a few coppers...</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The run through the Butcherblock mountains was refreshing. Remembering
each way point, and even the guards as he ran through, Balkin found the smile
coming back to his face. He had been grim, and angry for far to long. It
seemed, over the past month, that he was never happy, and his arugment with
Lady Trespare, after her death at his feet in Najena, had not helped. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>How could he live up to his vows, and protect the leader of the Winterborne?
If she would not be protected? None died while he was there to prevent it!
NONE! If someone died, it was because he was already dead!</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>It was not as if he asked her to stand back from the fight. She was a
fine fighter, and an excellent companion, but her life meant more than his
own. She led the Winterborne, she led the search for a cure, she was the
focal point of the Winterborne. All events in some way revolved around her.
He knew she had lived uncounted Eons, knew she had a stubborness in her that
had grown for unknown ages. Perhaps she just couldn't understand what it
was like to be mortal. She was not a dragon now though. She did not have
the power she once had. She was mortal, though her ties to Vox kept her spirit
from departing this world when her form was slain. He was there to keep her
alive, be that with his blade, or his life mattered not.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The smile left his face as he raced towards Kaladim, reflecting back on
the past month or so. Indeed, it was a grim visage he presented to the outer
guard, as he ran past into his home city. Quietly he muttered to himself
as he entered the great hall... "Bah, if one o' us is gonna die, it's damn
well gonna be me! You hear me girl?" </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The grin that came to his face after saying that aloud was kind of sheepish.
Wouldn't she have a fit if she ever heard him call her girl? and Brell forbid,
he do it in front of others! That would be bad indeed. Whispering in his
mind, he said into the silence "Yer life be MY charge, and I'll nae see you
die at my feet again. Understand?" With a sigh and a rekindled smile, he
let the joy of being home seep into him. First a drink, then the bank to
exchange his coin, and then to the forge. His foster father should still
be there. If not, twas a short trip to the family dwelling. It would be a
fine day indeed. It was good to be home.</I>

<I><FONT COLOR="#8080ff">Posted by Fera on August 11, 2000:</FONT></I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Fera wandered through the woods aimlessly. It was dark, well past her
usual bedtime. She was cold, dirty, and tired. She managed to scrounge up
a bit of edible roots to sustain her. But her stomach rumbled nonetheless.
Her head was sore, the hair still stained with blood. She tried desperately
to recall what happened. Her memory wasn't fuzzy; in fact it was crystal
clear&#133;up until her exploration through Black Burrow&#133;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>But there was no time to think about that now. Fera knew her strength
wouldn't hold out much longer. She needed a safe place to rest. And she needed
it soon. The forest was a little different than that of Greater Faydark,
the surrounding wood of her hometown, Kelethin. The salt water in the air
told her she was near the ocean. That would have to be enough to go on. Once
she got her bearings and was certain of the direction she was heading, she
stayed her course.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>It wasn't long before she found a break in the forest, a clearing of
magnificent green pastures that sprawled out and reached up into the foothills
of two very daunting mountain peaks.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Well, if I'm back in Faydwer, these surely must be part of the Butcherblock
Mountains. I'm too far from Kelethin to try to make it back there." Fera
frowned as she trudged along until she came upon a merchant's small hut.
The sign said 'closed', but she was so dreadfully tired, she had to try.
Her wrap on the door was followed by some shuffling around inside. A grizzled
dwarven woman met her weary gaze and scratched at her bristly beard.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Cantcha read? We're closed! Ya got no business with us that can't wait
till the morn. Be off witcha!" The dwarf scowled at Fera and abruptly slammed
the door in her face.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>By this time, Fera was too exhausted to plead with the peddler. So, off
she stumbled, in search of a more hospitable place to rest her head. She
didn't get much farther before the path started shifting before her eyes.
She tried to blink the fatigue away.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Halt! Who&#133;" a gruff voice floated in the darkness toward Fera. She
barely made out the glint from his sword before slumping into a heap at the
dwarven sentry's feet.</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin turned quickly, Axe raised, when he heard the sentry shout. Weren't
no one gonna get into Kaladim with him blockin the way.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He almost laughed when he saw the slim Wood Elf slump at the sentries
feet, till he remembered the last time Trespare had done that to him. Scowling
now, he walked back to the sentry as they stood there, looking around for
someone in command to tell them what to do.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Looking at these sentries, Balkin had to shake his head. His father had
been right, we was nae for the guards, he was for the world. Though proficient
warriors in the extreme, these guards just didn't have what it took to be
other than guards.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Whacha gonna do wit' her?" Balkin asked the sentry that had issued the
challenge. The guard looked at Balkin's scared face, and scratched his beard
"Dunno". Balkin sighed to himself, so equolent. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Well ye canna' leave her here! </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Dunno, gonna haf ta' get da captain."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Scowling at the guard, Balkin shouldered him out of the way. "Bah, get
yer dumb arse back to yer post". With his 2 Handed Executioners Axe in one
hand, Balkin reached down with the other huge hand, and grasped a fist full
of the front of slim Wood Elves leather tunic, and easily lifted her off
the ground, throwing her over his shoulder. Glaring at the sentry, who was
about to speak, Balkin spun on his heal and began his walk back into the
city.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The guard stammered behind him "But, uh..." Balkin ignored him, and re-entered
the city proper. His mum would care for the elf till he could figure out
what she was doin colapsin at the gates. She had no wounds, and didna look
hurt in anyway, nor starved.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Bah, he scowled to himself. What in the name of Brell was he doing...
Shaking his head, he forwent the smithy and the bank, and instead headed
straight to his family dwelling. The curious look o' his Dwarven kinfolk
just made him scowl harder, and he was one grumpy dwarf when he finally entered
his families hall.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>His mother looked up quickly when she heard his armor clanking, a warhammer
close to hand, as she worked in their home. Balkin grinned at the sight,
never without a weapon close to hand. That described the dwarven race all
by itself. His mother smiled brightly, at the sight of him, but quickly grew
concerned, when she saw what it was he was carrying.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"What did you do to her?" his foster mother asked, as he dumper the wood
elf uncerimoniously on the bear skin rug in front of the hearth. "Nothin"
he grumbled, "she collapsed in front o' the gate guards, an they just stood
there lookin stupid, so I picked her up and brought her here. Ain't no wounds
I can see, and she ain't starved, no idea." She just shook her head, "They're
fine guards, and we have no trouble here within the city." Balkin retorted,
"Don't mean they ain't stupid." </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She laughed, and pushed him off towards the back of the dwelling. "Get
outta that armor and clean up, there's a meal ready soon, and yer father
will be home. I'll tend to her".</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin sighed, as he turned away from the Wood Elf lass. She seemed healthy.
In fact, seemed more asleep than hurt, but his mum would take care of it.
She was a cleric in the temple. If she couldn't heal the elf, there were
many what could. Balkin stood his huge axe up outside the hall to back of
the family hall and went back to his room. It had been some time, but the
place was a neat as if he had never left. Dumping his full packs on the table,
Balkin stripped out of his armor, carefully inspecting and buffing each piece
as he did so, even removing the jewelry he wore, and placed it carefully
on the armor rack. He wouldn't need it for a couple days at least. Filling
a couple water urns, he washed the armor smell and sweat from his body, then
put on a new pair of pants, and the thick Blacksmith's apron that hung there,
then grabbed a sleevless, lace up leather jerkin. He'd probably be at the
forges with his foster father the next day.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Returning to the main room, he saw that his mother had removed the Wood
Elves leather armor, and cleaned her up. She still wore pants and shirt,
but boots were gone. She was partially covered with a fine blanket, and had
another rolled up under her head like a pillow.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The sight that made him smile though, was his foster father, sitting at
the table, with Balkin's Executioners Axe in hand, pulling his beard hairs
out and splitting them on the edge of the blade. Balkin laughed out loud
at the sight, and his father grinned right back. "Glad to see ye can still
keep a blade sharp" his father said through his smile. Balkin embraced his
father, then his mother. Now that he was out of his armor, she would allow
it! "Aye, I get lots 'o practice tryin' ta' keep it sharp, trust me." His
father smiled again, "I bet."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Checking Balkin's chest, since the jerkin was not laced yet, then his
arms, his father said "New ones?" Balkin looked at the angry scars on his
chest and arms before replying, "Yeah." His father just shrugged, "Oh well,
time to eat eh?" </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Shaking his head, Balkin laced up his jerkin, and sat down. "Aye, I be
tired o' travel rations, I need a good meal." "What o' the Elf?" His mother
responded, "She be sleeping, and has been the whole time. I've given her
a little spell to keep her that way, and cleaned her up. She seems more exhausted
than anything. She'll wake tomorrow sometime." Balkin nodded, and dug in
to the huge bowl of stew his mother had placed before him.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The sat at the table for hours, eating, his foster parents proding Balkin
to tell of what he had been doing. Balkin talked of his adventures. Of the
huge complex that the Winterborne were constructing, out on the plains of
Southern Karana. Of his need for some good Dwarven Stone workers to construct
the Inner Keep. Marleck Stonehammer was the best, both father and son agreed.
They would go see him tomorrow. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Throughout the night, before he went to sleep himself, Balkin felt his
eyes drawn to the Wood Elf, as she slept by the low, banked fire. Who was
she? What had happened to her to cause such exhaustion, and colapse at the
Kaladim Gate? And why, for the love of Brell, had he drug her home like some
child who had found a wounded animal? He knew why, but didn't want to admit
it. A female Wood Elf, collapsed at his feet, still struck a nerve. With
a sigh, he settled in for some sleep, it had been FAR to long, since he had
rested in a real bed. Perhaps he would have some answers on the morrow.</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>A light flickered before Fera's closed eyelids, waking her. Slowly she
opened her eyes, one then the other. The room was dark, save a bit of light
coming from the last dying embers in the hearth. Sitting up, she stretched
her arms to the ceiling only to suddenly snatch them back down. She gazed
at her left arm in amazement. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;That&#146;s odd,&#148; she said quietly. Frowning, she looked it
over, turning it this way and that, rubbing her forearm.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>An involuntary shiver came over her and she pulled the soft blanket tighter
around her shoulders. Sitting beside the hearth, she watched and listened
as the last cinders crackled to their end.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"I see ye finally came 'round. Sleep well, did ye?" A low, gruff voice
sounded from the shadows.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Yes, um..I'm sorry if I woke you. I..uh..who are you? And where am I?"
The young wood elf peered into the shadows and was able to make out the outline
of a stout dwarf leaning back in his chair.</I>
<P ALIGN=Center>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin watched the slim woodelf, as she began to wake. She had slept through
the night, the next day, and into the night again. It was near midnight,
near as he could figure, when she finally truely awoke. She sat up smoothly,
and stretched, then snatched her arms down again. "Surprised, at no wearin'
armor" Balkin thought to himself. She spoke, apparently to herself, but Balkin
couldn't hear the words.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He mearly watched, as she pulled her blankets up around her shoulders,
and sat quietly watching the last embers of the fire pop and fade.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Finally, he spoke. "I see ye finally came 'round. Sleep well did ye?"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Yes, um..I'm sorry if I woke you. I..uh..who are you? And where am I?"
</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She peered at him in the darkness as she spoke. He knew she could make
out he was dwarven, but no more in the darkness. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Bah, I ain't been sleepin'. Me thinks I should be askin ye the same
questions, no?" A quiet chuckle rumbled through his chest. "But I'll answer
ye just the same."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"I be Balkin, called "Ironfist", and ye be in me family dwelling deep
inside Kaladim. Ye colapsed in a heap in front o' the outer guard over a
day ago. Me mum has been tending to ye while ye slept. Ye had dried blood
in yer hair, but narry a wound on ye. Me mum says ye was more drained o'
yer life energy, and exhausted, than injured. I says ye slept like the
dead."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She seemed confused, and uncomfortable, as he told her the tale, brief
as it was. "But how? Um, how did I get to Kaladim?"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin frowned into his beard, scowling.... "Bah, How would I know? I
found ye at the guard! Ye no remember?"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She pulled the blanket around her shoulders again, and pulled her knees
up to her chest, hugging them there. Furrowing her own brow, as she thought,
finally she sighed, "No..."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>With a thump, that startled her like a scared rabbit, Balkin let his chair
down on all 4 legs again, and stood at the same time. He strode over to the
embers, threw a few chunks of wood on them, and stirring it up into flame
again. Then he turned to the elf. "Then ye have a problem."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She stared in surprise, at the criss cross of scars she could see covering
his imposibly wide back and thick arms, as he stirred the fire, then shied
back, as he turned and leaned towards her, finally in the light. he wore
only his pants, and the front of him was even more scarred than the back!
His thickly muscled chest and torso had so many, it looked like a crazy
spiderweb. There was one vicious one that ran up through his beard, between
his eyes, and into his hairline at a slant, and it was this that drew her
eyes to his. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The rock hard intensity there riveted her. She was held by his gaze, felt
as if he was studying her soul. Distantly, she heard him speak. "Then ye
have a problem." </I>
