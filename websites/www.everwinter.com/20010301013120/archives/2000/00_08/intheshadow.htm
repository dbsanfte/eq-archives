<I>Rianna trudged past the leaning stones of the Druids in the wind-swept
commonlands and finally made her way towards the tall wizards pyramid that
stood near the edge of the lake. It's throbbing, humming power caused her
halberd to almost vibrate in her grasp as she flopped down on the top that
was used as a power source for most wizards teleporting spells. Morphite,
Kimber, Birik and Zsalshun were there, waiting to lead the way to the groups
chosen hunting spot near the sands of the hills. Feeling tired and cranky,
Rianna finally managed to rearrange her pack and repair the nick in her blade
before following them across the grass. Once they reached thier agreed upon
location beneath the shade of a large tree, Rianna crept slowly towards the
location pointed out by Morphite. The slight shifting of the air in the area
just barely gave her notice of the shadowed creatures floating nearby. Summoning
her mana from the earth, Rianna concentrated a spell towards the nearest
of the creatures, forcing it into an early sleep. Pulling her bow from her
pack, she lined up a shot on the one next to it, and let fly an arrow that
pierced it's shifting form and caused it to rush towards her, dragging an
unfortunate skeletal pet with it. Running backwards, Rianna allowed the creature
to follow her until she backed up to the tree where the party had made it's
ambush. Acting quickly, she grabbed her halberd and swung her bow back into
it's place on her back. Hearing Morphite begin his casting behind her, and
Zsalshun and Birik fall into the chants they needed to funnel power from
thier respective gods. It took only a moment for her to realize then, to
her horror, that there was more than one of the creatures in front of her.
Apparently there were more of the creatures hidden nearby, and they had come
to the call of thier fellow. Gritting her teeth and shouting curses, Rianna
swept her blade in a futile gesture to keep them at bay, and felt herself
pierced with spells and blades. Falling into the blackness of death, with
the dying screams of her companions in her ears, Rianna once again cursed
the bitch Vox who had brought her here, and would raise her yet again in
form. No death...only pain.</I>

<I>OOC- Morphite, Zsalshun, Birik, Krudd at the last, and myself went after
shadowed men in the West commons early in the eve, much to our deaths. Numerous
attempts to pull met with failure on my part to cull some of them out. We
finally abandoned the attempt, and tried to head for Najena. There we were
met by Balkin and spent some time hunting Terrors before Zsal was almost
killed in a rout by the guards, and elementals that run free there. Balkin
departed for Freeport, and after numerous deaths, I made my way towards the
Karana's for an errand I had put off. I beleive we were all dispirited and
angry by that point. My apologies to all for the deaths and mass destruction.
It was one of those days...</I>
