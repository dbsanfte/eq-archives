	      <I>I am Amorsaylnn Frost and as I put this quill to parchment, I am a young
	      magician having just reached by 21st season. My father is Makaz, a retired
	      enchanter and animation, who has sponsored my membership with the Winterborne,
	      to serve in his place in an effort to unravel the mysteries facing this
	      group.</I></TD>

	<I>I was born and raised in Neriak, a beautiful if dangerous city especially
	for one such as I. While my father is of the appropriate heritage, my mother
	was not. Although most of the surface world mistakes me for a pure dark elf,
	my intense green eyes being my only obvious odd trait to the unfamiliar eye,
	to another dark elf it is often evident that my mother was human.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I spent my younger days within Neriak, having only recently seen the surface
	world with my own eyes. My father, a merchant and Enchanter named Makaz,
	provided the necessities of survival while he pursued his own studies and
	adventures, his priorities of profit and power occupying nearly all his waking
	moments. My younger days were spent under the tutelage of skilled sorcerers
	in Neriak; an honor that my father purchased with platinum as my heritage
	would normally not afford me such a privilege. Most of my days were spent
	in the silent camaraderie of various elementals, which fostered my interest
	in magic and summoning. Later I worked in The Blind Fish, my father's bar
	in Neriak, and learned many practical skills from watching the common fights
	and treachery that occurred routinely.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Several months ago, Shivrehel, a member of the Winterborne, approached
	my father with a fanciful story of ancient magic and animations. He explained
	that he sought out these animations, magical "golems" of such complexity
	and ability that they are almost indistinguishable from the living, except
	for a few select methods of detection. My father was not easily convinced,
	but in time both he and I came to believe Shivrehel's story and the fact
	the truth: that my father is an animation. In addition, Shivrehel found that
	I was something of a puzzle, having some but not of the animation traits:
	essentially a mixture of the magical and mundane, the offspring of a hybrid
	union of the magical and natural.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>At the time of this revelation, Makaz suspended his business dealings
	for a time in order to work with Shivrehel in researching the mystery of
	the animations. I began to travel outside of Neriak for the first time, quickly
	gaining an appetite for greater knowledge of the outside world as well as
	increasing my own skills as a magician. I saw other races without the chains
	or branding indicating their status as slaves, and experienced the prejudices
	that are harbored by most against my kind. I began to travel with other
	Winterborne, fortunately discovering that not all of the surface folks share
	those traditional views of my people. I have also begun to learn the harsh
	lessons of my own limitations, including my own lack of control over my temper
	and emotions, perhaps a trait I carry from my father.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>A few days ago, my father was forced to leave Neriak, banished as the
	end result of attacks against him by those enemies he had made over the years.
	The lurid details of his punishment are not worth putting to paper here,
	but suffice to say he is no longer welcome there. His body has begun to betray
	him, not from age but the accumulation of injuries and a difficult youth,
	but he has found welcome refugee on the west coast, in Qeynos. He and I have
	both adopted that city as our home, and Makaz has begun a search for my mother
	on my behalf, while I work with the Winterborne on his behalf. In the meantime,
	I look forward to further exploring the wonders of Norrath, as it is a diverse
	and wondrous land. I am trying to overcome my agoraphobia, my discomfort
	of the open sky that is a common aliment of those from Neriak who live on
	the surface. Most importantly, I am eager to meet with others of the Winterborne
	and work toward our common goals. </I>
