<I>Surprisingly, Olam had loosened his hold on the dark elf. The days of
secretarial work and scrying had been replaced by many moons alone and time
to focus on his on goals. <BR>
<BR>
"My own will be done," he chuckled. The phrase tickled his lips as much as
his fancy. The months had passed by slowly. Much of his time had been spent
learning his limitations, unfortunately.<BR>
Gone was the stead fast blade of Olam. Gone was the reassurance that should
defeat come, Olam would not let Malozc fall unless he, himself had fallen.
The two, despite being Master and servant, were not enemies. Malozc had no
love of evil, only the mere fact that the blind good that so many of Norrath's
citizens had, led them astray. When Vox's call came to him, he merely waited
for Olam's go ahead, and followed. It was quite clear Olam believed the call.
It was only by sheer loyalty to the Conclave that Olam nae left. <BR>
<BR>
But Malozc . . . well, he was free now. Free to learn and
experience.<BR>
<BR>
His first days were met with bigotry -- that trait infamous in other lands,
it was all too evident here. Innkeeps who only noticed the colour of his
skin beat him down. Guards attacked him without provocation. These guards
would soon come to know the power of vengeance. Should Malozc find a way
. . . there would be amends.</I>
