<I>Balkin sighed as he put his fists into his lower back and streched upright.
He'd been at this damnable brewing barrel for so long he was forgetting what
it was like to carry his axe! With a deep sigh, he looked at the packs scattered
around him. All stuffed full of bottles of Vodka and mini casks of Ol' Tujim's
Fierce Brew. Every one of those packs was crammed to the top. Balkin Knew,
he had finally mastered both of these drinks. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>It had been a long journey... Working on his brewing had quite suddenly,
become a matter of pride to Balkin. He was a good brewer, and already considered
a master when this urge had hit, but he wanted more. Seriously, what dwarf
did not master brewing? It was ingrained into his people he thought. Balkin
grinned suddenly. Who cares! It was fun!</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Chuckling to himself, Balkin picked up his heavy packs and headed for
the gate. He'd had a sudden idea, and it seemed a good one. His arrival at
the West gate of Freeport went completely unnoticed. There were so many people,
both experienced, well known figures, and youngsters trying to make a name
for themselves. The press of people was fairly heavy, as Balkin trudged under
his load, and headed outside the gate. Setting down his packs, Balkin surveyed
those around him. Mostly youngsters, but that was going to be part of the
fun.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Grinning silently to himself, Balkin cut forth with a great Bellow, startling
those around him. His voice carried to the streets of the city, it was so
loud!</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"I, a Master Dwarven Brewer wish to share my bounty with the people of
Freeport! Meet Warrior Balkin Ironfist outside the gate for a celebration!
Free drinks for all!"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Grinning, he watched the swarm of youngsters run towards him. The flurry
of shouts, both greetings to himself and to others was nearly deafening!
Balkin began passing out Casks of Ol' Tujim's Fierce Brew in stacks of 5
each. It didn't take long, just as he suspected. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>It wasn't called "Fierce" for nothing!!! He laughed to himself, and then
outloud, as the youngsters got "Falling down drunk!" They staggered around
him, and even the older, more experienced drinkers found his Brew's to be
"Fierce" indeed! </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin passed out cask after cask, his back beginning to hurt again, at
the constant bending, but he had over 400 of those small casks, and he meant
to give out every single one! Many came to him for a second stack, or even
a third, and Balkin obliged them. All in all, he figured he had given drinks
to over 30 different people! He decided, at the last moment, that he would
save his bottles of Vodka. He knew of three different brews that would use
them, and they were indeed, tough to master. It did not matter though. Many
poeople, of several races had enjoyed his brews. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Finally, Balkin slid his empty packs onto his back again. Not a single
cask was left. He looked around, at the people sitting, standing, or even
passed out around him. The youngsters would remember this one for sure!
Especially when they tried to get out of bed in the morning!</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin guffawed at the thought, then, waving to those around him who were
coherent enough to understand he was leaving, he headed back into the city.
As he walked, his thoughts returned to the brewing barrel. Thinking of few
berries he had in his pack, he felt himself drawn back to the barrel. "Just
a few more" he thought, as he bought some more supplies from the Bartender
inside. The human smiled, and just shook his head, as Balkin walked out with
his goods. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Concentrating, the armored dwarf placed his ingredients in the barrel
just so. The drink he was attempting, was quite new to brewers. A strong
halfling drink commonly called a "Stouter". None knew what skill was required
to make it yet. His eyebrows nearly raised into his hair, as he succeeded
in making one after another, using up all six bunches of berries he had in
the process. With a sigh, he realized he could learn nothing from making
the stouters. Oh well, there were harder drinks to make.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>This was where it got difficult. The next brew required a fire beetle
eye. Balkin frowned, then snapped his fingers. The youngsters commonly sold
these to the merchants near the West gate. In fact, that huge ogre was probabaly
bursting with them! </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin jogged over to Boomba, and inquired as to Firebeetle eyes. "Me
got lots" was all the Ogre said. Well, that and grunting, as he counted the
coins Balkin gave him to cover the huge pile of eyes. Back at the barrel,
Balkin started combining his ingredients. The drink was called a "Bleeding
Brain" and was very difficult. It wasn't long, before he had used up all
his vodka making Bleeding Brains. he had two large stacks of them though,
at the end. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>With a big smile, Balkin wondered what his friends in the guild would
think, as he broke out his "Bleeding Brains". A friend came buy, and brough
him more Vegetables to continue his work. Balkin shook his head and laughed,
even his friends kept him at the damnable barrel!</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>And so, Balkin started making Ginesh. As difficult as the Bleeding brains,
balkin made 2 stacks of those as well before he ran out of supplies. Picking
up his packs again, the dwarf headed for the bank to put his enchanted jewelry
back into his vault. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>It was time to go get his axe. He needed to work out the kinks in his
muscles, and his guild mates would be expecting him soon, in Lavastorm. The
shadowmen had been making excursions into Norrath. This was not acceptible.
The rifts had to be closed, but he knew not how that would happen. Instead,
the guild would go to that rift, and kill everything. Perhaps it would slow
down their scouts. Who knew... but as he left the bank, and looked at the
sky, he knew it was time. Starting at a mile's eating jog, Balkin headed
for the commons. The first part of his journey to the Lavastorm mountains.
All thoughts of brewing faded into the back of his mind, as his thoughts
began to focus on killing. Aye, twas time for battle, and his friends would
need his blade.</I>
