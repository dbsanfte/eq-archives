<I>&#147;Note to self: Do not aggravate centaur chargers.&#148; Fallon read
the scrawled handwriting that was on a scrap piece of parchment.
&#147;What&#146;s this? Ye were wrestling with the centaurs again Shar?&#148;
</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;Aye, but do nae ruffle thy feathers. I was accompanied by Balkin,
Zsalshun, Morphite, and even Daddy made an appearance.&#148; Shar answered
through mouthfuls of warm bread dipped in gravy. &#147;We had a great night.
Well, once I learned how to behave. I&#146;m afraid I&#146;m still not used
to working with people.&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;Oh? Tell me what happened.&#148; Fallon wiped her hands on her apron
and took a seat across from the pale lady.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Shar took a long draw from a goblet and began, &#147;If ye&#146;ve ever
been to the southern reaches of the plains, ye know there&#146;s a centaur
village there with a handful of stables. Well, we decided we&#146;d claim
one of the stables for our own, which meant keeping out all the centaurs.
Aye, I know, twas a pretty arrogant notion, but we were intent on proving
ourselves.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;Our first bout with the centaurs was disastrous. No sooner did we
slay a few of them, when Daddy Charger came home. Unprepared to take the
beast, we were forced to flee. However, we came right back. Gluttons we all
are, ye see?&#148; The pale lady laughed and wiped her mouth. &#147;The rest
of the eve went fairly well...once I slowed down and paid attention to
Morphite&#146;s directives.&#148; The pale lady stopped then and looked Fallon
over. &#147;Ye should reconsider thy homely ways and strike out with us some
time. Morphite opened my eyes yester eve to the potential an enchanter has
in combat.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;Ah, but back to my note. I quickly grew impatient. With Zsalshun
there, I was hard put to find my niche. The night before, I used my shamanic
powers to keep Varlik alive while we fought the aviaks in their village.
I knew my place, so to speak. But what happened there is another story. My
point is, my sole purpose in tree town was to keep Varlik and Talamara healed
and prepared for battle. In the stables, Zsalshun was more than able to keep
everyone healed, at least I believe she was. Once everyone was prepped with
my spells, I didn&#146;t have much else to do. It took quite a few poundings
by some grand daddy chargers to convince me that poisoning them was not the
way to contribute. But by the end of the night, I began to relax and even
enjoy our time bashing those hooved brutes!&#148; Shar paused and took another
swig of the Saerloonian Topaz.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Fallon forgot herself in Shar&#146;s story. The anxious look on her face
made Shar laugh. &#147;Do tell, what did ye finally do then, if not poison
them? And what of the rest of the party? How did they fare?&#148; She
didn&#146;t say what Shar knew she was thinking. &#147;What of Morphite.
How did the enchanter make out?&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Shar let out a throaty chuckle and continued. &#147;What did I do? Well,
once I finally figured out that poisoning the larger centaurs aggravated
them into a rage, I decided to stop that and join Balkin and Vaber in the
fight.&#148; The pale lady flexed her arms. &#147;I am shaman, I am
versatile!&#148; Shar roared with laughter.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;I wonder, who is this Vaber fellow? Ye&#146;ve nae mentioned him
until now.&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;Ah, Shiver&#146;s bag of bones! Vaber was the servant he summoned
that eve.&#148; Shar&#146;s face became grave then and she leaned closer,
whispering, &#147;Ye know, he grows more powerful by the day. I don&#146;t
doubt he&#146;ll be wrangling with the gods of Norrath soon.&#148; The lanky
barbarian leaned back in her stool then, stretching and yawning. &#147;Well,
m&#146;dear, there&#146;s more to this story, but I reckon I can&#146;t stay
awake a minute more. Perhaps one of the others will be along and they will
share their version of our horse hunt with ye.&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Fallon rose, smiling. &#147;Aye, ye go right on ahead and gets some rest,
lass. Io knows ye could use it.&#148; Fallon patted Shar on the back.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;Good night Fallon,&#148; mumbled Shar as she headed to her
quarters.</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin stood his blade in the corner out of the way. He would nae need
it here, in Fhallon's presence.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Aye lass, I can tell ye be bursting with questions! Someones already
been here and told ye about our little trip to the Centaur village eh?" Waving
his hands to keep her silent, the scared warrior removed his gauntlets and
helmet as he sat down to her table. Nae lass, a bit o' whatever that is that
smells so good, and I'll give ye what I saw."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"We didn't get there till late, mostly my fault. Seems these short legs
just do nae run fast enough!" Chuckling to himself, the dwarf dug in to the
savory stew Fhallon had made. Speaking between bites, he continued.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"We was a mite disorganized at first, and ended up getting chased outta
the village by a Charger. Big mean brutes, I can tell ye. Ye seen them yet?
Quite a sight to be sure. We regrouped at the bridge to the Northern Plains,
then returned to the village. The damnable charger was still there, and was
our first target.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Now, before I go further, ye know how it is for us who stand on the front
lines eh? I be up in close with me blade, and do nae see what is happening
around me. Only what be in front of me. Tis difficult sometimes, to know
what goes on in a battle. Morphite ended up taking charge, as an Enchanter
should. Twas he who kept the other brutes around us pacified, so we could
concentrate on one at a time eh? Mean as they be, a Charger is nae much,
when confronted with a cohesive, determined group. That we were lass, that
we were. Thier fighting style is different, and we learned much from battleing
them. Shiv kept his bone friend active at me side. Tis odd sometimes, to
be fighting with a summoned creature. The silence, as they attack, and as
they are hit can be unnerving. I've grown used to it eh, but it is odd. Morphites
summoned pet was of assistance as well. Though it must be painful for that
skinny Erudite to step in the way of some blows, just so his magic'd animation
will defend him."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin grinned ear to ear, as he rememeberd the fight. Morphite had nae
been very skinny when he was getting hit. He had taken the form of a Troll,
that it's healing power would aid him. Didn't mean he took the hits better
though! Laughing silently to himself, the dwarf continued.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"We became quite efficient, by the end of our hunt, I assure ye. Zsalshun
actually complained about having nae much to do! Can ye imagine that?! Sharhel
took a beating a couple times to eh? Once she stopped poisoning the big 'uns
and started wading in next to me, she had a much better time of it."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Twas quite a night lass. I picked up enough arrows to keep me in stock
for a while. Yours be better fer sure, but until I can improve me skills,
tis a waste to use them. I'll get through these, then maybe ye can make me
some good ones eh?</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>So, for all, things went well. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Shivrehel, though perhaps a might lower in skill than was safe, did very
well with us. He even landed a couple spells on some o them beasts that I
thought would be beyond his abilities. O' course, that bone friend o' his
put quite a pounding on some o' them Centaurs to"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Sharhel keept us all in fighting trim, keeping her magics strong on us,
not to mention, her direct combat abilities, she landed some heavy blows
too."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Morphite, I'm afraid, spend most o' his time trying to regain his magics.
The spell casting required of him was tremendous, but he bore up well under
the strain." </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Zsalshun kept us healed, though at times, there was nae much o' that
required eh? And she kept some powerful spells o' protection on me. Strong
indeed. Me thinks her skills improve nearly every time I meet her! She also
took some hits as I recall. Chargers don't like anyone healing their "victims".
He took great offense to her healing me during the fight. We took him though,
and every other horse we could entice into the stable we had claimed."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"We were also joined by the Cleric Birik. He be a friend o' Morphites,
and someone I've fought with several times. A boon he was, while he was there.
He could nae stay long, and we continued without him when he left."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"And then there's me. I find myself coated with gore more often than not
these days. The guild has done well of late. Many battles we've fought, and
tis good to be able to stand in front o' me mates. Me Armor helps me greatly,
and me blade bites deep. Once I get somethings attention, it rarely turned
on anyone else. O' course, having a knack for knowing just what it is that
makes 'em angry helps." </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin Winced, remembering the flurry of blows that had followed, when
he had made a remark about one of the charges parents, and his offspring.
*Sigh* Suddenly, he realized he was rubbing the ugly scar that went up through
his beard, across his nose and between his eyes. Jerking his hand away, he
stared hard at Fhallon, who seemed to be busy cleaning up the dishes, once
full, now empty, that the dwarf had used. Sighing again, Balkin glanced at
the backs of his hands, at the crisscrossed scars there. Still, not one had
faded.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Getting up from the table, Balkin bowed to Fhallon. "A fine meal me lady,
now if ye will excuse me, I have needs to tend to me armor, and sleep. Tis
a long run from the Centaur village to Qeynos, and I was tired to begin with.
My thanks. The others are around somewhere. I suspect they will stop by."</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The journey was long and hard, but the enchanter had finally acheived
the experience he needed, to convince the guild leaders he was more than
committed to the ways of alteration, and could, indeed, handle the responsibility
that gold enchantment carrier. The rain was pouring down over the plains
and the quicker he could return to Qeynos, the faster he'd be able to get
to work practicing his new skills. Trading partial clarity of mind for spirit
of wolf, he sped across the plains, chuckling about his new found skeleton
illusion.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Arriving in Qeynos was as mundane as usual. The same guards held their
post, the same drival passed this way and that. "No matter," he said half
to himself, "I'm happy to have a good part of my journey behind me." He touted
his horn to Balkin and Sharhel who offered contributions to speed his way
on the gold craft he was about to partake. After receiving their gifts he
was told by Shar to visit Fallon in the nearby inn. "The lass would like
to know more of our night at the horsees!" she gaffawed, slapping the frail
man on the back. The assault nearly dislodged his neck from his body as he
tried to look unharmed and responded with a weak, "okay."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Quickly he ran about Qeynos trying to find the spell that would allow
him to enchant gold. "Where is that blasted scroll!" The merchant laughed.
'You'll nae be finding that sort of enchantment here, Erudite. The Tier'
dal have stolen all known copies of the scroll and placed it in their library.
Morphite's cursing could be heard far across the plains. He'd have to work
someone into the Nariak home to get that spell for him, it seemed that even
Morphite's illusions and magiks could nae fool some of those guards. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He sighed heavily and entered the inn to wear the small enchanter sat
cleaning away the last of the meal. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Fhallon's eyes sparked when she saw the black robed enchanter come through
the door. She was aflit with all the energy her youth afforded her. "Morphite!"
She squeeled, as she dropped the dishes she was holding. "Come, tell me the
tales! Tell me the stories of our craft!"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>A bit taken back by her zeal, it was welcomed. The erudite had become
accustomed to stuffy converstations regarding tactics and life, and hadn't
really thought about the abstract world of feeling liked! Softening his tone
he looked about to be sure no one else heard him baby talk the young
creature.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Well, where would I begin? I'm sure you've heard tales from Shar? Of
her roles and others?"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She nodded, "Yes! And you just missed Lord Balkin, of Warclaw. He was
doing a fine job telling of the dreary nature of hand to hand combat, but
then he started drifting away . . . you know that look people get when they
start thinking of something else?" Morphite nodded. "He started tracing his
scars, icky!" Morphite laughed.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Well, then, what can I tell you more . . . let's see . . ." he scratched
at an invisible beard and closed his eyes. Leaning back he recounted in his
mind's eye, the events that unfolded.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"There was much to be learned that night. My life, the life you now pursue
is one of great power and great peril. You can control the flow of battle
with the wave of your hand, but just as quickly, can that same tide turn
and engulf you. Only a bright warrior and clever cleric can save you from
certain peril." The conversation was a bit too global for her tastes. He
could she was looking as his garb and jewelry rather than listening to the
conversation. He smiled.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Very well child, let me sum up for you the issues you will face... but
please do, pay attention for just a short time, will you?" She sheepishly
smiled agreement.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Quickly then, you have in your arsenal, or you will, the ability to bewilder
monsters to the state that they will not attack and will just stand there."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"And then Lord Balkin and Lady Shar can bash them and poison em to death!"
Fallon blurted out excitedly.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Morphite glared, "NO!" Fallon fell back in her chair in a chastisized
slump. "THAT, my child, will get you killed!" "Don't you see? A bewildered
creature, we'll call him enthralled, is not frozen or stunned. He's meerly
convinced for a short time, that there are things to ponder, rather than
fight. That said, ANYTHING that causes that creature pain will distract him
from that thought path and thus, fighting becomes paramount once again. This
includes slashes from the mighty Balkin or the sickening wrench of Shar's
poison. These things are best saved until the group has picked their primary
target. The others must be left alone to their thoughts, or even better,
we do what we call debuff!"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Morphite had actually consumed himself in the discussion. Fallon, in the
meantime hadn't wandered, but actually took out note and pen and scribed
notes! He'd reached her, finally, an apt pupil! "Some ale, Fallon, I have
more to speak!"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The ale flowed freely and Morphite continued.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Now dear Fallon, I'm sure you've been told that I was a rather controlling
man that night, yes?"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Fallon paused but then blurted, "Well, Shar said she was not going to
poison, and said Zsalshun was bored and Balkin was .. . " Morphite hushed
her with a wave of his hand. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Please, Fallon. Slowly. Let me address that which you've noted already.
Do you know what Zsalshun's main function is in a party?" </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"To heal?" She half asked, half stated. Mophite nodded a smile in
agreement.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Correct. And what is Shar, the barbarian Shaman's role?"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Fallon looked stumped. "Well, she said she's a healer." </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Is that when she's with Zsalshun?" the enchanter queried.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Well, not so much as you'd notice." Fallon giggled.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Morphite chuckled, "Aye, she's what'd they call backup healer. But that's
not her main function anymore. Do you know what shaman's CAN do, Fallon?"
He didn't wait for an answer, "They debuff! Do you remember that term? Shamans
are trained in all sorts of ways to cause problems for their enemies. When
coupled with an enchanter, they can ease us some of our burden and actually
become a backup enchanter of sorts! That saves our nose from the book as
often!"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Fallon continued to scribe half notes to herself. Most of it, he was sure
she'd bounce off Shar for validity, which is what he wanted... intelligent
conversation always befitted the family.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"You see," he continued, "her job in groups with clerics present and enchanter
in full effect, should be to discover her less utilized spells that do not
cause damage, but can prepare the enthralled for the beating to come. Let's
take a small example to explain this to you." Morphite looked at the table
and made up a mock battle scene for the excited enchanter. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Okay, this salt shaker is you Fallon. This fork is an archer, this knife
a charger, and this spoon another archer. These other condiments are your
party. You survey the situation, and lucky for you, the creatures are not
normally hostile." Fallon looked sad. He quickly answered, "We'll worry about
why you attack them in another lecture." She nodded solomly. "So you know
that your magiks are most likely to fail against the tougher beasts. Knowing
this, you suggest to the group that they focus on the hardest beast WHEN
You're ready. Get their agreement. Next thing you do is haste your melee
members -- the more damage they can deal, the more the enemy hates them,
the faster the enemies dispatchment, the less likely your enthrall spells
(when cast) are to fail at an inopportune time."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He watched her scribbing subside and continued, "Next you go for the next
weakest creature and enthrall him. Easy enough, right? Wrong. This is an
act of agression, any monsters near that target just got very angry with
you. Quickly your party should focus on the originally agreed upon primary
target. As soon as that target is off you, enthrall that second target."
Morphite arranged the utencils to trace to the battle. "Now there are two
creatures enthralled and the last is busily fighting your meleers. Reduce
the magic resistance of that creature and, now is where Shar should step
in and slow him." </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"But I can slow them!" Fallon said energetically. "</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"But you don't have to do it all, my child," Morphite responded. "Shall
I guess and say that Shar felt a bit out of place that night?" Fallon nodded.
"Don't you see then? There was plenty to do and be a part of. She has an
arsenal of debuffs and whatnot that do not cause damage and can considerably
make enemy's lives harder. Following on the footsteps our magic debuff, you
know, the one that makes them look nervous? She should have her drowsy magiks
flowing!"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Fallon smiled. The light was brightening.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Follow that with Shiver's strength drain for example, and you have a
party full of debuffers, that don't have to cause damage and still leave
the creatures enthralled! Now, one note, Fallon. Remember our tanks are fighting
the hard creature, we've attempted slows and some debuffs on him , only to
the point of too many resists. Don't waste too much time when you're resisted
. . . move on. The cleric is there to watch out for him. Let me guess, Zsalshun
was reportedly bored as well?" Fallon again nodded. "Don't you see? There
is a world of work to be done, that when spread out, takes the load off of
that one overbearing enchanter and makes the whole group integral!"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Fallon laughed. "It's a family affair!" </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Morphite sat back with a puzzled look. Seeing the innocence in her eyes
he merely agreed, "Sure. I suppose it is, I suppose it is!"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Morphite sighed and tipped back the last of his mug. "Well, child. I grow
weary and must continue my craft. Please do watch yourself and your friends.
And remember, each of us is important." </I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Zsalshun frowned, trying to decide whether to go back to the Eastern plains
to kill gorge hound or to lite out after the treants and see if the people
there could use the skills of a healer. On one hand, the hounds were tedious
with poor fur that sold for little while the Treants were much more satisfying
to whittle down to size. Unfortunately, she was languishing in the midst
of near uselessness. Anything she could do, a druid or a shaman could mirror
and much brighter. She chafed to wake up one day with the knowledge of greater
healing. Then, only then would she feel like she contributed something worth
while to a party.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She sighed and stretched. She had a few things from the centaur raid to
sell off and she thought, with dark ironic glee, to take them right back
to the same village and sell them to the hoofed merchants there. It appealed
to her dark humor. With the speed of Shar's spell she flew along the plain
towards the stables.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The raid had gone well, after the initial confusion. The priestess was
enjoying working with Morphite more and more and was again impressed with
his battle savvy. The enchanter kept the party from being slaughtered more
than once and kept her flow of mana from draining entirely. That the erudite
called the shots bothered her none the least. Her job was to sit and watch
for leaks as the archers, shelties and chargers sliced and ripped at the
party. She was also able to add to the health and survivability of the group
by blanketing them in the gifts of her god. She knew what to do and she was
ever getting a better sense of knowing when and where to do it.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She frowned again as she checked her supply of agates. Shiver had given
her a sizable amount which forestalled another trip back to Qeynos but several
had been wasted when she wound up overwriting the same spell cast by Birik.
The worshipper of light did not coordinate well and his disregard of mana
efficiency constantly grated at the Tier 'Dal. His mana was his business,
but foolishly jumping in front of an enraged charger and getting his limbs
and organs rearranged soon became the dark priestess' problem. Even Shar
did not take that long to learn what hurt and how not to make the hurt happen.
Birik just kept leaping in with his glowing mace held aloft and limping out
with the last shreds of his life hanging about him. Zsalshun supposed it
might be the bright light given off by the weapon that addled his brain so.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Enough thought on that, he would either learn or perish. The centaur village
lay quiet in the night but there were still lights on in the merchants stalls.
They never asked questions about the obviously horse crafted yew and they
even paid a fair price for their return. The money would help defray the
cost of the spells she would need when Innoruuk decided she was ready to
contribute positively to a group. The formidable healing and stronger protection
magics were almost in her grasp yet so profoundly far away that she fairly
screamed in frustration. Thus the dark god mocked his clergy and thus the
ebony priestess would be on edge until she could prove her worth. </I>

<I>The dazzling crystal smiled patiently as Morphite rose from his seat.
She secretly thanked Io for granting her such a young vessel. Though her
hands ached from the age setting in, and even her eyesight had begun to
deteriorate, it was apparent that no one in Norrath was the wiser of her
heritage. "Morphite, ye've renewed my sense of adventure. I do believe I
will start out on the morrow and begin my training again."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>After saying her farewells to Morphite, she leaned against the closed
door of the inn, rubbing her knuckles and gazing dreamily at nothing in
particular. It would certainly be nice to adventure with her brethren once
again. The Earl's return was a success, though she was loathe to know the
details since Shiver had a hand in his return. Nonetheless, it was good to
have Johan back. There were just a few more of her family that were unaccounted
for. Presumably they enjoyed a healthy life somewhere. And hopefully they
too would find their way home.</I>
