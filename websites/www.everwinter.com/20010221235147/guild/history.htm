	is a work in progress. &nbsp;Frequently, it makes reference to events that
	occured within the Council of Wyrms or Conclave of the Wyrm. &nbsp;The Council
	was a Neverwinter guild that existed between late 1995 and late 1997. &nbsp;Due
	to a potential trademark infringement, the guild changed it's name to the
	Conclave of the Wyrm. &nbsp;The Conclave is still active, a sanctioned guild
	on the Xegony Server of Everquest, but under different leadership.</I></FONT>

	<I> Citizens of Xegony, heed the eldest of heralds--the biting wind of the
	north, the raging storm from the plains of eternal frost. It bears a tangled
	tale from the nadir of the Lair of Lady Vox, a legend of exiled dragons and
	the spawn of an archmagi.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Long ago, an erudite of great magical prowess, a peer of Miragul, formed
	a pact with the rogue white dragon. His experiments led to an immortality
	quite unlike the Lich&#151;fame through his creations. He constructed a race
	of automatons&#151;he termed them animations&#151;using the combined might
	of enchantment, sorcery and necromancy. The first generation was promised
	to Vox, the lesser known as Ice Goblins, and the greatest were veritable
	giants of frost and ice. Her servants forged an empire in the north, outside
	the rule of the Ring of Scale.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>The second generation is the stuff of myth. It is said that this archmagi
	created artificial life. Taking the forms of all the races of Norrath, these
	"animations" were identical to their emulated forms, be they human, elf,
	or troll. When the archmagi died, his vassals hid the second generation within
	many cities. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Twenty four years ago, a dragon from a different land fled a God of undeath
	and the wrath of his own kind. dr&#146;Shivrehel Despana&#151;called Dirge
	among men-- found his way into Neriak, emerging from his world as a
	Teir&#146;dal. During his studies within the Third Gate, he came to be the
	guardian of two of these animations when their "mother" was cursed by the
	clergy of Innoruuk as a Blasphemer. He fled to the land of Neverwinter, and
	his kind survived there, the origin of his charges forgotten.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>After the fall of the city of Neverwinter, he returned to Norrath only
	to find tales of other animations&#133; and their "malfunctions." The
	archmagi&#151;Winter&#151;had not achieved the immortality he dreamed of.
	His children were failing to diverse magical maladies&#133; crippling pain,
	blindness, even insidious madness. His adopted daughter and consort was not
	immune. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>One eve, the Lady Vox came to him in a lucid dream. Her army was failing,
	falling to the same short-comings. Renewing the ancient pact, he drew upon
	the assistance of his old companions from Neverwinter to establish a noble
	House in Qeynos. Mercenaries were hired and the family, friends, and lovers
	of animations mustered to banner. Aided by Vox&#146;s agents, they began
	their search for the other children of Winter&#151;the Winterborne&#151;and
	a cure to their impending doom. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Recently, a momentous change within the House occurred. Queen Rianna
	Blisterclaw, who once led Dirge, Olam, and many other members of the House
	in Neverwinter, was summoned from her ghostly state and bound into the form
	of a wood elven ranger. Pleased to work from behind the scenes and gather
	intelligence without the burden of political maneuvering, Dirge stepped back
	into the more staid role as Assistant House Master. Mistress Trespare Winterclaw,
	as she is known in the land of Norrath, struggles to learn the past struggles
	that have fallen upon her friends, and understand the ways of this new
	world&#133; while Lady Vox continues to exert more influence over the young
	House.</I>

	<I><B>OOC: </B>Interested in a role-playing guild on the Xegony server? House
	Winterborne was formed from several founding members of the Conclave of the
	Wyrm, known as the Coterie of Wings (CW) on Tanarus, and the Council of Wyrms
	in Neverwinter Nights. We have been active, in one form or another since
	1995, and seek to bring our brand of role-playing and camaraderie to EQ.
	We are interested in mature players with the desire, initiative, and patience
	to build a enclave of epic role-playing and adventure. Please visit our site
	if interested. Class / Level / Race are unimportant. We also value interaction
	with other role-playing guilds and individuals. Allies and enemies for RP
	events are welcome.</I>
