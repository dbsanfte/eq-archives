	      <I>Being a gnome, you would suppose that I was born in Ak'Anon. However,
	      my parents were living in a treehouse when I came to be. My father was not
	      in residence at the time. In fact I still seek him. When I was eight, a great
	      tragedy befell me. A gating Erudite Necromancer knocked my mother off of
	      the platform. I ran to the lift and found her near death on the corpse of
	      the Priest of Discord. She had time only to say, "there is something you
	      must know about your father. He..." Unfortunately, that is as far as she
	      got. So, I headed for her bind point. To my amazement, she never appeared.
	      She had died the final death!</I></TD>

	<I>I decided to move to Ak'Anon and take up a trade. After being removed
	from apprenticeship as a tailor, Jewelcrafter, Brewer, and Smith, for my
	ungnomelike ways, I decided to try the test as an enchanter - for they are
	strange enough. Sure enough, I fit in as an enchanter, at least to a point.
	Always, others have looked upon me as strange: for the amount of help I give
	others, for the blinding headaches (not sure why my headaches can blind others),
	and my lack of focus on one aspect of life. I like to learn all that I can.

	<I>One day I met a dwarf named Brombeard, one who also seemed to be seeking
	in life as I was. We have remained close ever since. When he moved off to
	a new association - The Winterborne - he introduced me to other friends,
	most notably to me was Artes. Another who seemed to think as I do! </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I most humbly seek admittance to your noble order and to service to the
	Lady Vox.</I>
