	      <I> Working the wheat fields of West Karana, Artes takes a moment to wipe
	      his brow and rest his aching muscles. His eyes fixate upon the setting sun
	      recalling the lesson taught to him this very morning.</I>
	      <P ALIGN=Left>
	      <I>Master Tisquane, "Artes, today ye shall help with the fall harvest in
	      the Karanas. Think not only of this task as work but as a chance to practice
	      your monk skills. Focus mind and body on the tool as an extension of yourself.
	      This is the lesson ye shall master until the fall harvest is complete."</I></TD>

	<I>Artes picks up the scythe with both hands mumbling, "Tis true I have never
	learned to wield an item which requires both of my hands." He begins to cut
	the wheat with an awkward swing while his mind concentrates on the perfect
	way to wield the device. Remembering the teachings from his master recharges
	his will to complete the work this day. As nightfall descends upon the land,
	Artes prepares his camp falling asleep the moment his head rests on the makeshift
	pillow.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Many moons pass before the next entry is scribed.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>The master has traveled from Qeynos to oversee the final days of the harvest.
	From a hilltop, Master Tisquane observes young Artes handle the scythe with
	confidence. He controls the tool with such grace, his motions form an elaborate
	dance as he harvests the wheat.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Master Tisquane walks down the hill approaching Artes, "Young lad, I am
	most pleased in your skill development. The time has come to send you on
	a journey of self-identity. Many seasons ago you joined the brotherhood after
	your parents' were slain by the foul gnolls of Black Burrow. What you do
	not realize is the parents lost on that dreadful day were not blood, but
	foster parents. You are truly a son of Lady Vox, a Winterborne."</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Pausing a moment, "The time has come for you to travel the land seeking
	out other children of Winter. Learn of your past to master the present and
	future. Only together can all the children of Winter comprehend and dispel
	the maladies which strike many children now."</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"The training I have given to you over the years has prepared you for
	this day. All my wisdom is already bestowed and I can no longer further your
	training of the body. Take this raw silken robe and Wu's gauntlets as a gift
	in celebration of your becoming a man."</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>So this is goodbye, Artes thinks as he wipes his tear filled eyes. "I
	accept this quest and am bound to live by the honor and code of the brotherhood
	as I leave my homeland in search of answers." Compiled by a scribe of the
	Qeynos monk guild.</I>
