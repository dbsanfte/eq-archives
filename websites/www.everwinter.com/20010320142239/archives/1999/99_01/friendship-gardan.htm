<I>I watched the miles roll out behind me, wether walking down a road or
sailing fast on the wings of my dragon, putting distance between me and the
friend I left behind.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The Friend?</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Many times during these long arduous days, in my own little space I came
to wonder about that word "friend" and the responsiblities such a label might
carry. I had left Valator behind in the wilds of the world and had no idea
if he was well, if he was even still alive. Could a true friend so desert
another? Would a true friend allow a man to walk alone along troubled and
dangerous paths?</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Often I ponder the meaning of that word. Friend. It seems such an obvious
thing, friendship, and yet often it becomes so very complicated. Should I
have stopped Valator, even knowing and admitting that he had his own road
to walk? Or should I have gone with him? Or should I have shadowed him, watching
over him?</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>I think not, though I admit that I know not for certain. There is a fine
line between friendship and parenting, and when that line is crossed, the
result is often disastrous. A parent who strives to make a true friend of
his or her child may well sacrifice authority, and though that parent may
be comfortable with surrendering the dominant position, the unintentional
result will be to steal from that child the necessary guidance and, more
importantly, the sense of security the parent is supposed to impart. On the
oppisite side, a friend who takes the role of parent forgets the most important
ingredient of friendship: respect.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>For respect is the guiding principle of friendship, the lighthouse beacon
that directs the course of any true friendship. And respect demands trust.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Thus I pray for Valator and intend that our paths will indeed cross again.
Though I will often look back over my shoulder and wonder, I hold fast to
my understanding of friendship, of trust, and of respect. I accept, grudgingly
but resolutley, our divergent paths.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Surely Valator's trials have become my trials in many ways, but our frienship
is not in flux. From my perspective, I understand that Val alone must decide
his own path and, the depth and course of our bond.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Until the day comes that we once again share mead, or crack the heads
of our enemies, I will watch over my shoulder for that all to familiar gleam
of light bouncing of the bald head of my truest friend: Valator.</I>
