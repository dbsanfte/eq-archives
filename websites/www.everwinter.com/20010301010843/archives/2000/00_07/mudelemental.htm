<I>Tan frowned and rooted around in his bag of stones. He was trying to figure
out the magics of this land and so far, he had not determined what made a
strong pet and what made a weak pet. The stones, for sure had their varying
degrees of flaws but that did not seem to correspond with the ability of
the elementals they summoned. He picked a particularly round bit of malachite
and tossed it on the ground. He uttered the words that would shape the next
Potster and breathed life into the inert rock.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Moments later a hulking lump of earth regarded the small gnome silently.
Tan grinned and greeted the looming elemental.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;Welcome, Potster VI! Let&#146;s see what you can do eh?&#148; The
gnome looked about for a suitable target. In the distance the sail like wings
of an enormous bat crested over the tops of the hills. &#147;That one! Get
him!&#148; The elemental did not move. Tan furrowed his brows and scurried
closer to the immense flying beast. &#147;Here, attack him, that bat
there.&#148; He pointed. &#147;Bat! Potster, get the Ba-no, the BAT&#133;HEY
WAIT!!&#148; Tan bounced about as the lumpy conjuration lit out after a gnoll.
&#147;Where are you-AHHHICH!&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The gnome quickly gathered a spurt of flame and launched it at the gnoll.
Within moments, the dogish creature lay dead and it&#146;s coin in Tan&#146;s
purse. The small magician stalked over to the waiting pet. &#147;We gotta
talk, Potster, sit down.&#148; The elemental did a weird shimmy as it sat
as best as it could and waited for Tan&#146;s instruction. The gnome paused,
startled and amused that the chunk of rock could sit as well as did. Now
if it would only listen to more important matters. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;Well, that&#146;s a start. Now, here&#146;s the way of it. I choose
what we fight, you fight it, I burn the critter when he is thoroughly preoccupied
with your&#133;fists?&#148; Tan shrugged as he tried to find a better term
to describe the arm like projections that hung from the elemental. &#147;The
creature dies, you live, I live, and we reap the profits of a good kill.
Understand?&#148; The rock sat and said nothing. Tan peered at it, hands
on his hips as he tried to figure out how much of his speech, if any, had
sunk in. &#147;OK, from the top. We are hunting mostly bats, so lets find
one and grab it&#146;s wings. They make tasty treats you know.&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The minute magician patted his earthen friend and set out for the hills
to search for more flying rodents. He had his fishing pole and small spit
along and planned to try and make fish rolls for dinner. So far, he had been
rather unsuccessful but he was getting the recipe down a little bit better
each time he messed up. It was going to take a lot of bats and a lot of fish,
he feared, before he had enough rolls to last him a while. In the distance
he sighted the tell tail beat of the wanted wings and sped off to catch up
with the critter. Potster followed dutifully behind.</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Tan grinned from ear to ear. His bag was bulging with batwings and Potster
had preformed admirably. It was time for a well deserved break and he thought
he knew just the spot to lie down and think of this that and whatnot. Somewhere
in the hills there was a lake and Tan intended to get some fishing in that
eve. After a few wrong turns, both magician and pet crested the hill that
overlooked a long lake. A shanty and dock sat at one end and a couple of
northern men sat around talking to each other. Tan bounced up to the
barbarians.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;Hail, friends. How&#146;s the fishing in these parts?&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The merchant barbarian sighed. &#147;Th&#146; fish don&#146;t bite as
well as they used ta. I would suggest fishing somewhere else lad.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;Well, I just wandered out here so I might as well try my luck. Fare
well friend, and may the fish start leaping into your baskets.&#148; Tan
waved good bye and started up the shore towards a fleet of small fishing
boats. He hopped into one and set his gear down. There were no oars or no
visible means of moving the boat that the gnome could see. He scrunched his
face up in concentration and stalked about the craft looking for a way to
make it go. Potster floated obediently behind him. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The frustrated gnome tapped his foot on the prow of the boat. &#147;I
wish this thing would move!&#148; Suddenly, the craft gave a lurching heave
and slid into the glassy waters of the lake. Tan tumbled backwards onto the
floor of the boat, Potster tumbled overboard. The gnome sat up and looked
about, grinning at his success.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;Potster, we&#146;re sailing!&#148; He turned around to the ever
vigilant lump of earth. The back of the boat was vacant. &#147;Potster?&#148;
The magician peered overboard. &#147;Potster, get back in the boat.&#148;
The elemental came dripping up from the bottom of the lake to hover in the
rear seat of the boat. &#147;Very good. Stay here and we will have a bit
of fun!&#148; </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Tan puttered the boat around the lake until he got board. He beached the
boat at one end of the pond and got out his tackle and bait. It looked like
a grand spot to relax and catch dinner and that&#146;s just what he intended
to do for a few hours. That and try to create the perfect fish roll. He sighed
in contentment and cast his line. It was a beautiful day and so far, hadn&#146;t
once rained while he was flitting about in the boat or now that he was parked
on shore. He closed his eyes and hummed a little tune to himself.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Hours and many fish later, the gnome decided to call it a night. He had
not succeeded once in perfecting his recipe and the ground lay littered with
burnt batwings and charred fish. He at least had had fun. He called to Potster
as he packed up his things. There was no answer from the elemental. Tan stopped
his futzing with his fishing gear and looked around. His constant companion
had disappeared while he had been lying about on the shore. The gnome frowned
in worry and looked to the hills for his pet. He had heard of random elementals
wandering off and bringing back a whole slew of nasties at the most inopportune
times. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;Potster?&#148; The gnome glanced nervously about. He shrugged, assuming
that something had eaten his stalwart friend as he quickly dug out another
rock. He cast the spell to bring Potster VII to life. The spell caved in
on itself leaving the bit of malachite unaltered. Tan stared at the stone.
As best as he knew the magic of this world that could only mean that the
former Potster was still lurking around. He called again for his pet.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The gnome frowned and sat down to puzzle out the disappearance of his
pet. If it were to come back, it would have already done so he reasoned.
Therefor, it was either already here and invisible, which he had never heard
of the creatures being able to do, or it was hiding somewhere where he
couldn&#146;t see it. He looked about but other than in the bottom of the
boat, there was no where for the rock to hide. Tan got up quietly and stalked
up to the boat. He stood on tip toes to peer into the bottom, but to no avail.
The boards held no hiding elemental.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Tan grew impatient. He hated to leave the creature all alone in the hills
but this hide and seek was growing tiresome. He grumbled as he stalked up
and down the lake shore. He had specifically told the obliging lump of earth
to stay by him when he got off the boat. Tan looked out over the lake as
he stopped his wandering. Did he tell Potster to stick with him or stick
by him? These creatures sometimes took things too literally and if he had
told the elemental to stay while they were out on the boat, then it was most
probably&#133;.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Tan laughed as a string of bubbles floated to the surface of the water.
In moments, the little gnome had jumped into the lake and swum down to where
the earthy pet was dutifully staying put. It&#146;s poor soggy arms were
waiting for some word from the little magician to attack whatever fearsome
creature happened by as it forlornly looked across the bottom of the lake.
Tan beckoned to the creature but the water had eroded it so that it no longer
recognized the little gnome as its master. He sighed and swam back to the
shore to cast the dismiss spell for Potster. At least he had found the
unfortunate pet and had learned that they don&#146;t swim overly well. Next
time, he would be more careful in saying things to the elemental, least it
park itself somewhere more interesting than the bottom of a lake.</I>
