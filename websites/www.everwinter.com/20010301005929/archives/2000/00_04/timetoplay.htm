<I>The barbarian witch jogged through the outskirts of Qeynos, dodging the
army of unarmored humans scurrying after the rats and fire beetles that plagued
the town. She ran without pause, honing in on the darksong that enveloped
her like a cool breeze.<BR>
<BR>
She spotted him&#133;rather, she spotted his spell effects on one of the
Darkpaws. She watched in awe as the gnoll was surrounded by an eerie glow
and his lifeforce drained away within seconds. "Ah, there ye are, daharil."
Shiver smiled malignantly, his violet eyes glinting in the
moonlight.<BR>
<BR>
Shar eyed the dark elf quizzically. "Incredible! Ye seem very different
tonight&#133;relaxed even. If I didn't know ye, I'd think ye were centuries
younger." The barbarian smiled playfully. "She should've come back sooner!
Yes, I heard about what happened. I stopped by Fallon's as soon as my ship
docked. She prattled on about this and that. Apparently it was quite a spectacle,
Rianna's return. I'm sorry I was away. As ye know, I was investigating the
cleric Eglantyne." The pale lady drew closer to the dark elf. "I can fill
ye in on the way. Fallon said ye are ready to travel the plains. Let's get
ye out of this cesspit then, shall we? Shar smiled mischievously, backing
the dark elf against the wall. " Ye'll find the prey there much more
challenging." <BR>
<BR>
Shiver's lips twitched with a bemused smile, and he let her kiss him.
<BR>
<BR>
"Welcome back, dobluth," she whispered. "Ye aren't feared here yet. But ye
shall be. A pox on that Bertoxolous and his followers! Soon he too will grovel
for mercy at your feet."</I>

<I>The pale lady sat cross-legged on the beach. The sand was still wet from
the recent rain, but the barbarian witch didn&#146;t seem to mind. She&#146;d
just said her farewells to Shiver at the wizard&#146;s pyramid. Aspect assured
him a safe return trip to Neriak. The dark elf&#146;s amethyst eyes had glinted
in the moonlight. He&#146;d seemed elated to get away, anxious to return
to the dark elven homeland. Unlike her, he had the enviable position of having
some place to return to.<BR>
<BR>
She flipped the cover open on the compass-like apparatus she held. She idly
turned it this way and that. On cue, the needle spun whenever the device
was pointed toward her. Shar smacked it on her open palm over and over again.
Still, it only responded when it faced her.<BR>
<BR>
Having given up on making the device &#145;work&#146;, Shar stared out across
the water, absently turning the device over in her hand. A single tear ran
down her cheek. &#147;AHHHHH!&#148; She cried out and hurled the device into
the water. The pale lady gnashed her teeth and tore at her face and pounded
her fists in the dirt. After awhile, she stripped off her clothes, leaving
them in a haphazard pile on the beach. The tears still streamed down her
face as she walked into the water.<BR>
<BR>
**You can beat this. Just accept what you are, Shar. Trust the others. They
are all looking for the same thing&#133;Here, you&#146;ll need
this.**<BR>
<BR>
The seemingly wise selkie nudged the pale lady with her muzzle. The device
was in her mouth. Shar took it back, &#147;Yeah, sure. I suppose that&#146;s
easy enough for ye to say...I know ye, don&#146;t I? Ye belong to that family
of selkies Fallon rescued from the poachers in Butcher&#146;s Bay, aren&#146;t
ye?&#148;<BR>
<BR>
Shar tossed the device onto the shore. It landed with a clang atop Shar&#146;s
banded armor. **Thanks for the advice. But I didn&#146;t ask for it, nor
do I want it** Shar spat the scathing thought back to the selkie. She turned
back to the seal-like creature, snarling and ready to throttle her. But the
selkie was long gone, sensing the rage in the witch&#146;s
thoughts.<BR>
<BR>
Exhausted after her tirade, the pale lady emerged slowly from the water and
donned her armor and equipment. Not having the energy to muster a spell to
send her back to the guard tower, she laid her hand on the sand and rested
her head on it.</I>

<I>The north end of town was still sleeping. The early hours just before
dawn found a stark-skinned girl sneaking back to bed after a long night&#146;s
work.<BR>
<BR>
&#147;Oh, if only I had your nerve, Dahar&#146;i.&#148;<BR>
<BR>
The lanky girl closed the window behind her and felt her way in the dark
to her bunk, smiling at the sound of the alias she chose. Reaching up, she
pressed a finger to her bunkmate&#146;s lips.<BR>
<BR>
&#147;Shh, ye&#146;ll wake the others.&#148;<BR>
<BR>
&#147;Where do ye go, sister? What is out there that ye&#146;d risk getting
expelled?&#148;<BR>
<BR>
Shar laughed softly, &#147;Ye don&#146;t want to know, trust
me.&#148;<BR>
<BR>
The pale lady laid back and closed her eyes. She&#146;d made significant
progress tonight. Soon she&#146;d be on the inside. Once that was accomplished,
she&#146;d send for further instructions.</I>
