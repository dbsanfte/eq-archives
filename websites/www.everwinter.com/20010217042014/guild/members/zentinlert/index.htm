	      <I>Hail! I am Zentinlert, a Dwarven cleric of Brell, in my 19th season.</I>
	      <P ALIGN=Left>
	      <I>I was born in Kaladim to a kind family. My father was a smith who's specialty
	      was making Dwarven platemail armor. My mother, well.... she was o' bit strange.
	      I grew up around Dwarves and hadn't even seen another race until I stepped
	      out of Kaladim for the first time.</I></TD>

	<I>I was stepping outside for o' bit of hunting. "Hunt only bats, son," my
	father had said, for I was only but six years old.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I crawled over a hill an hour later as I drew my trusty mace. The bat
	was hanging from a tree as I sneaked closer. The bat's eyes shot open. It
	let out a screach as it attacked. Well, me and my platemail armor, I thought
	I was invulnerable. So young and stupid I was...</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>The bat attacked with such force, it knocked me to the ground. As I was
	knocked unconscious, I felt a spell of healing race arcoss my body as a Feir'dal
	cleric beat down the bat. " Are you alright lad?" asked the elf.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"I'm fine, now who-and what- are you?" The high elf let out a hearty
	laugh.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"I am Moinester. High elven cleric, at your service." The elf bent at
	the waist, slightly. He walked off.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>That was the day I decided my destiny as a Cleric.</I>
