<I>Once, not long before they entered the Lavastorm Mountains, Balkin and
his companions sat late around their campfire talking of their beliefs. A
question was posed, what does everyone believed about death and dying. What
was the perfect death? The answer Balkin gave after several minutes of thought
was not what his friends expected. It was also the longest speech they had
ever heard from him, or would probably ever hear from him again. <BR>
<BR>
He began his thoughts thus. &#147;Death is an enemy that stalks us all. Many
fear it, some welcome it. For someone of my profession death is also a companion.
He takes our enemies from us during battle, and patiently awaits the time
for us to join him. He expects a warrior to die on the battlefield. Coated
in blood not his own, his weapon striking his enemy, a scream of battle lust
on his lips as he fades away. <BR>
<BR>
Blood and honor earns each warrior a place at the side of his god in the
afterlife. This is a good death. It is what I expect mine to be. It is not
the perfect death. <BR>
<BR>
The perfect death is of old age, in a warm bed, with the generations of your
family surrounding you. Knowing that you have left a legacy. Knowing that
you have passed on your skills, abilities, and your warriors heart to the
generations. Knowing that others will benefit and learn from your teaching
and your experiences in this life. <BR>
<BR>
Death, a warriors enemy, and his friend, will wait for you. He will greet
you as you fade away from this life and approach that which comes after.
Use your life well my friends for death walks with us all. Be what you are,
do what you do, but do not fear him. He will not harm you. That happens in
this world. That is the way death is.&#148; <BR>
<BR>
Silence hung heavy in the air as Balkin stood and walked from the fire to
stand, staring at the mountains ahead of them and at the stars. Memories
of his past may haunt him but he would go forth into the future looking straight
ahead, not fearing, communicating with death in his own way. That was the
way it must be.</I>
