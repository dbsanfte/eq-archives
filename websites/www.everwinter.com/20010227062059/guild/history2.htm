	<FONT COLOR="#000000"> </FONT><I>There is a human saying: &#147;Discretion
	is the better part of valor.&#148; My kind would call that cowardice, but
	survival has always been of paramount importance to a creature with cards
	of defiance and spite. Who am I to argue my nature? I play the hand I&#146;ve
	been dealt and, like any gambler, I prefer to win.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Much has changed since I&#146;ve been able to take up quill and jot down
	my thoughts. I long for the sanctity of my Spire. Would my hand have been
	different, I would have chosen a simpler life--perhaps a fisher. The waters
	have been frosted with white-caps of late. Lord Infernius of Mire is at the
	center of the whirlpool. In his cantankerous pride, he attempted to thwart
	my efforts to unite the Black clans and a rather bloody battle between his
	Clan and those under my control ensued. The shores of Fireshore were red
	with their spent life. Black scales littered the sands like shells, and bones
	washed up like driftwood.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Beauty aside, the Council intervened, summoning me to the Aerie. My control
	of three clans and meddling in numerous others was matched with another charge.
	A rather vain bronze named Olam and a self-righteous brass called Rianna
	followed me to Solon and reported their findings. &nbsp;Mykell, the stubborn
	Custodian and puppet of the status quo, issued a decree that carried the
	punishment of death in a most barbaric manner. They wanted to revive the
	custom of breaking wings, plucking talons and fangs, and exiling me to Forbidden
	Isle. As tempting as that vacation was, I chose to invoke a portal to an
	adjacent plane.</I>

	      <I>I stepped to Norrath into the form of a seasoned dark elf in the underground
	      city of Neriak. Over the last few days, I&#146;ve used my knowledge of the
	      theory of magic--thaumaturgy--to become an acolyte of the Necromancers&#146;
	      guild. The truth is, while I understand a great deal about magic, I do not
	      know the incantations of this land, and remain as weak as a babe. Only my
	      ability to open rifts between worlds remains. I am treading carefully. They
	      seek proof that I am not who I say I am, merely a commoner embracing the
	      will of Innoruuk. I intended to give them no such information, but--</I></TD>

	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Today, I may have cracked the ice. The Teir&#146;dal--the dark elven name
	for their people--were kind enough to teach me an minor incantation of shielding,
	as well as the spell to draw life from opponents. Thus armed, they expect
	me to travel to the Nektulos Forest and prove myself upon the creatures there.
	Such is the will of Innoruuk. I am not suited for combat here and make no
	such pretenses of grandeur. I have no items of magic in my possession, only
	the stained gray robe they hung over my shoulders and a dull dagger. I have
	no intentions of facing a shadow wolf so ill-prepared. Martyrs may make a
	good tale for their clergy, but I fancy a longer game.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>There were merchants offering more spells for gold I did not possess and
	I can&#146;t stomach begging, so I turned to the library. If I could learn
	more about these people and their magic, how difficult would it be for me
	to create my own incantations? I have seen dark elves with less intelligence
	than I summon a skeleton to do their bidding. Surely having someone fight
	for you, whether they be dead or alive, is preferable to facing a black
	bear.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>My research in the library of the necromancers of the Teir&#146;dal has
	resulted in several interesting notes on archmagi, powerful men capable of
	mastery over all the schools of magic of Norrath. I know I should be
	concentrating on blending in, but the people here are so different! I&#146;ve
	always found it natural to study all fields of magic, yet they divide their
	study by school. There are enchanters, mages, and wizards in the Common District
	of Neriak, but the necromancers call them the Scorned, misled. My interest
	in visiting them grew over the first few days and finally, I searched for
	tales of a necromancer that employed other magic.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I found such a man among humans--imagine the surprise--who lived in a
	place called Erudin. His name was Miragul. Even in these libraries, so controlled
	by the guild and so distant from his homeland, he made an impact. This power
	could allow me a comfortable life on Norrath, prevent assassins from the
	Isles from posing a danger, and perhaps my vision could be realized with
	such influence and ability. I have heard of few, if any, of my kind on this
	plane. Who could stop me from bringing about reason... from destroying the
	gods that feed off our faith?</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>When I asked the guild master about him, he treated my interest as heresy,
	and my reputation was blighted already. I intend to conduct any future research
	more covertly. The ghouls guarding my room have pronounced my situation grave--no
	pun intended.</I>

	<I>Again, I owe ye an apology, diary of mine. Times are desperate and I&#146;ve
	been watched carefully. &nbsp;I have tested some minor magic and gathered
	some supplies should a quick egress be called for. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the
	laws of Norrath are very different from the Isles. What I&#146;ve been able
	to do was alter my seeming. Now, that may sound like an impressive feat,
	but it carries with it a high price, as I&#146;ll relate. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I was trying to clothe myself in an illusion, as the enchanters often
	do. As my dark elven visage faded, I found myself in the body of a middle-aged
	human man, perhaps thirty winters old. &nbsp;Humanity has never been one
	of my preferred races. They live quickly and die with alacrity that terrifies
	even the coldest of elves. I would be quick pickings for the Teir&#146;dal,
	save the fact I was no where near Neriak.</I>
	<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="0">

	    <TD><P ALIGN=Center>
	      <I>I learned that the rural town I had manifested in was known as Surefall,
	      and was home to an order of druids and rangers, the Jagged Pine Folk. I listened
	      to the people speak of the will of Tunare and mention a rain Lord known as
	      Karana. I couldn&#146;t even pretend to follow this Tunare, a power of life.
	      But Karana... the demands were sparse. I could feign devotion to such a being.
	      Thus, I undertook a quick study as a druid--perhaps the first godless
	      druid.</I></TD>

	  </TR>
	</TABLE>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I had little time to spare, and in short order, I resumed my dark elven
	being, returning to Neriak. I had, surprisingly, not been missed. Perhaps
	the ritual that moves me from form to form also hides my absence. It is an
	alien magic to the Teir&#146;dal. They understand illusions, but this was
	true form. &nbsp;I could not invoke my shielding spell, nor the ability to
	tap life forces as a human. I did master two short prayers, however. One
	healed wounds and the other fortified my skin with the strength of wood.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Ye may find it odd, my pursuit of the druidic magic. Consider this. They
	tap the anima of life around them. They say it is faith in Tunare or Karana,
	but I assure ye I have no faith. Rather, I have will and understanding of
	their magic. Their prayers carry the same mystic words the incantations of
	necromancers do, though with an emphasis upon the living and natural instead
	of the undead. Most will never see the similarities, but I suspect the clergy
	and the mages of this land have more in common than they&#146;ve guessed.
	They need a guide, as all save a few of the eldest race, have from time to
	time.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>If time and safety permits, I intend to return to Surefall. The fishing
	is superb and it is a quiet, idyllic dell. A man could pass his days in peace
	in such a glade. That lure remains as tempting as a grub is to the trout,
	though I always as though I&#146;m swimming; if I stop, I shall sink forever
	beneath the waves. Though, isn&#146;t that peace, too? That&#146;s a poor
	mindset for the potential savior of the young races, but I can&#146;t help
	the urges within me. A rest would be so refreshing, and yet I know that will
	not happen. My sense of duty to these poor, misled sheep won&#146;t allow
	it. They need me, even if they&#146;d never admit it.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I plan on continuing my investigation. I have found no sign of pursuit
	from the Council. Few of my kind have the ability to travel. Fewer still
	could locate this world. And, of them, who could master the magic of this
	place quickly enough to pose a threat? I rather hope there is no answer to
	that question.</I>
