	      <I>What can I tell thee that ye&#146;ll believe? I was born so long ago,
	      time was meaningless if it even existed. My kind are long-lived and I am
	      exceptional among my kind. As brazen as that sounds, I have ample support
	      for my audacious claims. I was named dr&#146;Shivreheldespaire, and ruled
	      the Under Hel of the first world at the behest of Faluzure, the Night Dragon.
	      Eventually, I tired of his divine posturing and his corruption. Dragons should
	      nae be subject to the spectre of death or parodied in undeath. I fled, eluding
	      the elder power, until I returned to the surface and became lord of Clan
	      Darkmoon.</I></TD>

	    <TD><I>I quickly subjugated two other clans, Lurker and Mire, then set out
	      to settle a score. My kind were always hunted by humanity and when my brother
	      Magdelen fell, I swore to avenge his death. I seduced a young acolyte and
	      brought down justice upon the Covenant of witches that had taken residence
	      in his lair, but the Council of Wyrms did not permit interference in human
	      culture. The library holds an adequate account of this mission in Solon
	      (<A HREF="../../journals/vow.htm">HERE</A>). I was sentenced to death, but
	      escaped to another, much younger world.</I></TD>

	<I>In Norrath did I meet my wife, Vespre. She was born of the Teir&#146;dal
	and recently widowed, a mother of two adopted children. Soon did I learn
	these children were nae what I expected, but rather magical creations wrought
	by an archmagi of the land. Faluzure found me through his persona as Inorruuk.
	He cursed Vespre to a horrible death, a rotting disease, and I fled to Toril,
	a cosmopolitan city known as Neverwinter. I have found several journal entries
	I made from this time. Ye are welcome t&#146; examine my diary
	(<A HREF="../../history2.htm">HERE</A>).</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>In Neverwinter did I find the fate of fellow exiles, notably those who
	were so richly "rewarded" for their role in reporting my interference with
	humanity. They too were exiled from the Isles, from our home land. They banded
	together under the leadership of a gold calling himself the Great Wyrm, of
	all things. He was clearly a deluded hatchling. In a matter of weeks, he
	was dead by my hand and this new Council was well under way. Again, my journal
	has a more detailed account of the event
	(<A HREF="../../journals/newcw.htm">HERE</A>).</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I was called away to Terra, a land in which no magic functions, shortly
	thereafter. Vespre was suffering, the disease wrought upon her by Faluzure
	effective even in that land. Eventually, she succumbed to his dark will,
	though her children were safe. They followed me back to Neverwinter, guided
	by their long forgotten nanny, ry&#146;Fallon. They sided against me, joining
	forces to end my existence, believing me to be the cause of their mother&#146;s
	death. They did nae succeed.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Years passed, and I devised an elaborate ruse to keep Faluzure from my
	life. I saved a rogue topaz known as Lokisun, preparing his nearly vacant
	mind to hold my own personality. It took many months and during it, he was
	reunited with his lover and sister, Eclipse (here). Nonetheless, I completed
	my mission. I fought Faluzure, knowing I would fail, and transferred my mind
	into Lokisun&#146;s body. Unfortunately, my comrades in the exiled Council
	felt obligated to assist. Several perished and my Queen Rianna suffered the
	same disease Vespre had, years earlier. While fleeing the battle ground,
	I was trapped by Chronepsis on the astral plane. She reared up, breathing
	over my new body&#133; and suddenly I was a corpse, though aware. Lokisun
	proceeded to flee as my destroyed, true self, watched.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<FONT COLOR="#8080ff"><I><B>((The history behind&nbsp;Dirge's nature and
	the loss of Rianna&nbsp;can be found
	<A HREF="../../journals/nightdragon.htm">HERE</A>.))</B></I></FONT>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I learned much about myself then. I was truly a child of Io, a force greater
	than the powers. I would not perish. Perhaps I could not. I tapped the power
	of the eternal and branded myself Dirge, the dark song. I returned to
	Neverwinter, though few knew of my identity. In time, Rianna showed signs
	of the disease and stepped down. I ascended to the throne of the exiled Council.
	&nbsp;We recruited a veritable horde of humanoids to assist us, notably the
	venerable Star Riders and a group known as the Sons of the Grey Wolf (Steppe
	Warriors). Together, we laid siege to the Aerie of the Council on the Isles.
	We were victorious, though the price was high. We called the new rule the
	Conclave of the Wyrm and I proceeded to send agents to other lands, to make
	their mark.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>We traveled to Sosaria, a land known as Tanarus, a place called the Realm,
	and to Norrath. Over the years, I found myself suffering from a hollow sensation.
	Those I called friends were few and far between. The crown, so to speak,
	was heavy upon my head. Finally, a creature known as the Radiant united many
	of the Council-loyal clans and they were opposed to my rule, and that of
	my friend, Valator, who had foiled the Radiant long ago. Battles raged, Valator
	was lost, and finally, we settled on a compromise.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>The Radiant was inducted into the leadership in Valator&#146;s place.
	He used his time and my aversion to what the Conclave was becoming. He corrupted
	the artifacts given to my kind by Io himself, or so legend stated. The Dragon
	Orbs the clans communicated with were permeated with a powerful charm of
	servitude to the Radiant. I discovered the plot far too late, but we fought
	valiantly to save our race. Dragons could nae live in slavery. Death was
	a better fate. I destroyed the binding Orb, but the backlash of energy took
	a toll upon us.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Our dragon forms were stripped, our power greatly reduced. I have some
	accounts of the events of this Orb Winter, held in the library still
	(<A HREF="../../journals/orbwinter.htm">HERE</A>). These accounts make me
	weep for lost friends and have displaced the very essence of what we are,
	or so I thought. Months passed, and I grew to loathe the Conclave. My friends
	were few, the price of leadership high. I no longer had my wings, nor much
	of the will that moved me. I journeyed to the land of Norrath again, intent
	on diversion. Shar, my adopted daughter, came with me&#133; and I learned
	of her fate.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>This is how I came to lead Winterborne... and as of a few fortnights past,
	I have come to step down and assume the role I was accustomed to&nbsp;in
	Neverwinter. Rianna, the Queen that I&nbsp;followed in that land--she who
	assisted me against the Night Dragon--has returned&nbsp;from&nbsp;her ghostly
	banishement (<A HREF="../../journals/return.htm">HERE</A>). I&nbsp;feel
	a&nbsp;great weight has lifted from my shoulders, a debt I can now address.
	Again, I seek what I&nbsp;once did... influence, power, respect, even fear.
	But this time, I seek this for reasons benevolent... to&nbsp;cure my fellows
	of House Winterborne.&nbsp; </I>
