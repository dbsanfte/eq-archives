<I>It had only been a day since Keldore had arrived with Raezel, Fera, and
Vijnana to Qeynos. It had been a day since the Silver Dragon trapped in his
seeming of a High Elven Wizard left the solace of the Greater Faydark, with
its lofty branches and sinister orcish hordes, and still he was having trouble
adjusting.<BR>
<BR>
Taking Vijnana's advice, Keldore threw in his lot against the gnolls of
Blackborrow immediately. They reminded him of the Crushbone Orcs from Faydark
in many ways, down to the racial slurs they shouted at him and the comraderie
they shared with one another. This was his problem.<BR>
<BR>
At first, he had found another with which he could practice his skills and
magic to futher advance the cause of the Conclave. Abruptly, his dog-catching
partner had vanished, leaving him outside what he had nick-named the Pound.
It was downhill from there.<BR>
<BR>
In Faydark, everyone was eager to help everyone, and there was a closeness
between those who would combat the scourge of orcs. In the Qeynos Hills,
however, everyone seemed to have a rather selfish attitude. Perhaps it was
the difference between the humans and the other Races of the Sun on Norrath.
Perhaps the humans had higher standards and valued solitude. Whatever the
case, he had found it very difficult to find someone to aid him in his
training.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, this led to death, after death, after death at the hands of the
gnolls, who seemed to enjoy large parties where elf meat was served.</I>
