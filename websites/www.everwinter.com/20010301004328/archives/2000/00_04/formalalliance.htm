<I>The runner knocked softly upon Rianna's door. He wasn't too sure of just
what had occured, but this was his second trip from the Winterborne House
to the Crystalline Dragon's caves. The creatures frightened him in thier
seemings, but he dealt with it for the shiny platinum that seemed to pour
freely from the new Queen's hands. Or was it the old Queen? He shook his
head. Who knew?The strange and new voice came once to him through the door.
&nbsp;"Enter dear boy." </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>How did she do that? He knew she couldn't see through the door. Or could
she? Sighing with dismay and a slight tinge of wonder, the young human opened
the door slowly and entered the rooms that now belonged to the Queen. They
had remained empty since Dhirge had built the House. Had he known she was
returning? He thought so, since the rooms seemed to be built around this
new presence, as if she belonged there. Fine silver and iron mirrors graced
the room, reflecting the light from several wax candles set in sconces on
the wall. Just opposite the door on , about 20 feet away sat a burnished
oakwood desk, covered with etchings of leaves and forest creatures. He could
almost swear he felt the life of the wood warm his blood as he drew closer.
The leaves were so detailed and delicate, that he just knew some magic had
plucked them off of a tree and then transformed them to wood. No human hand
could have carved such a thing. A padded chair sat behind it, empty for now,
but often holding the new Queen's wood elven form. Off to the right, a large
arched opening led the way into a sitting area for guests. Scattered about
in small groupings sat several cut stone chairs from Kaladim, burnished wood
stools from Kelethin and Felwithe, and an assortment of the small 'couches'
the humans preferred. The ones directly from Qeynos were done in soft greens
and browns, reflecting the area's historical closeness to the druid and rangers
that frequented the area. The others, shipped in from Freeport, were done
in an almost garish assembly of red and yellow. There was even two extra
large chairs suitable for a troll or ogre. Shaped like a Fungus creature,
with the arms of it's body outstretched to serve as armrests, it appeared
almost lifelike.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Come small one, stop your looking. I have work to do." The sharp tone
in her voice echoed off to his left from the arch that led into her bedchambers.
A shimmery magic screen kept him from seeing what was inside, but he noti
ced only the small slender form standing just in front. Her etched green
tunic gleamed with small jewels set in strategic locations to hold the magic
it needed to protect it's wearer from harm. The banded silver leggings of
her armor molded itself to her shapely legs, and overlapped her soft leather
boots. Her flowing auburn hair seemed to get more reddish by the day, but
he felt sure it was just a trick of the light. Her almond shaped green eyes
were narrowed in amusement. He handed her the scroll case, bowing repeatedly,
and stammered an apology. REaching into the small belt pouch on her slim
waist, she removed 5 platinum coins and pressed them into his palm. "Thank
you boy, you have done well. Go to the kitchens and get yerself some bread
and cheese from the cook. Tell her I sent ye. You can then await my summons
in the messenger hall." She smiled slighty as she said this and the boy quickly
bowed once more and hurridly left. Walking to her desk, Rianna sat lightly
upon the padded chir and removed the parchment from the bone scroll case.
It's plain case hid the importance of the documents within. Placing two small
stone scroll holders at the top of the scroll, she unrolled the white parchment
to read the contents.<BR>
<BR>
Alliance (Full)<BR>
<BR>
Purpose:<BR>
<BR>
I - To bind House Winterborne and Crystalline Dragons in a bond of friendship,

one another the best of their<BR>
abilities.<BR>
<BR>
Tenets:<BR>
<BR>
I - House Winterborne and Crystalline Dragons are prepared to join forces
should either come under<BR>
attacks of aggression from opposed guilds, clans, houses, or individuals
in the lands of Norrath and<BR>
will defend one another to the best of their abilities.<BR>
<BR>
II - House Winterborne and Crystalline Dragons pledge their members will

needed.<BR>
<BR>
Terms and Conditions:<BR>
<BR>
I - This alliance may be terminated at any time by either House Winterborne

Crystalline Dragons are<BR>

are no longer the active representatives of their respective
guilds.<BR>
<BR>
OOC Notes:<BR>
<BR>
EverQuest&#146;s PvP toggle prevents many acts of aggression; this document
is intended to promote<BR>
role-playing between House Winterborne and Crystalline Dragons through an
in-character alliance<BR>
and spirit of cooperation. In day-to-day occurrences, this equates to offers
of inter-guild grouping,<BR>
invitations to inter-guild events, and assured inter-guild trade, all with
a sense of fairness and honesty.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nodding her head with satisfaction, she placed her own emerald green seal
on the bottom next to Lord Dracone's, sealing the agreement. Leaning back
in her chair, she took a moment to rest before leaning over to summon another
House page. This alliance had the potential to bring 2 powerfull houses together
in common cause. Dhirge had spent much time paving the way for such an event,
but had done little to formalize it. Now that it was complete it was time
to announce it to the House, and send the document to Dhirge for his records
and keeping. Blwing an errant strand of hair from her eyes, Rianna leaned
forward once again and pushed away the dizziness that assaulted her. It was
becoming a common occurence in these last few days, and she hoped that the
trip to Unrest would not prove a mistake. She would hate to let down her
guard there. Ringing the small bell on her des, Rianna handed the scroll
and case to the young human girl that appeared at her door.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Take it to Dhirge's office Leal, he will be expecting it I'm sure." Rianna
then turned and began to pack up her weapons and supplies for the long trip
ahead.</I>
