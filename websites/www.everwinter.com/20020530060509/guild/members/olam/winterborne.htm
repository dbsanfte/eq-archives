	      <I>I wanted to write this, keep things straight in my mind. You deserve what
	      little I know of your past and here it is.</I></TD>

	<I>I was out wandering, looking for gnolls that wandered a bit too far from
	their fellows. It was midwinter&#146;s eve, and I had a hard time resting
	with the threats Lord Elgnub had made. That&#146;s when I found my charge
	swaddled in the rich white furs of northern bears, nestled between the
	snow-covered hills north of Qeynos near the caverns that lead to the Black
	Burrow. The gnolls were watchful, but Tunare protected me and I eluded their
	malicious intent. The Mother knows that the Darkpaw Clan has threatened my
	family before. Suffice it to say, I&#146;m no friend of the gnolls and wresting
	this bundle from their grasp was a small victory for me.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I knew I could not properly care for this parcel, and headed to the Jagged
	Pine Folks. Though we don&#146;t always see eye to eye, they are a good people,
	kind and practical. Corum Finisc, one of their leaders, met me and inspected
	my find. He was delighted and named you&#151;my find&#151;Winterborne. It&#146;s
	a fittin&#146; name, and you seemed down right comfortable, just sitting
	in the snow like that.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I don&#146;t know how you got there, or what the future holds for you,
	but Corum said he&#146;d train you in the ways of his people. No doubt I&#146;ll
	see you more, as you grow and master Tunare&#146;s magic. Maybe, when your
	power has come of age, you can help me seek justice against the gnolls and
	find out about your past.</I>

	<I><B>Shivrehel Despana&#146;s Review of House Membership:</B></I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>It was odd to be approached by the young servant of Tunare. He said he
	had a dream of Vox, and was her child, though he was trained in the ways
	of a druid&#151;much the same as this seeming of mine. He called himself
	Winterborne and was not referring to our house, but rather his given name.
	The coincidence was too much, so I called upon Aulura, whose service has
	been bequeathed to me from the Lady.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Aulura brought confirmation today. Vox&#146;s agents had been researching
	a lost animation that once was entrusted to her Empire. The child had been
	lost during a skirmish between ice goblin representatives of the dragoness
	and the gnolls of the Black Burrow. Twenty two years ago, a merchant of the
	area&#151;Marton Sayor&#151;found a young boy outside the burrow, wrapped
	in furs. He was taken to Surefall, and had been raised as a druid.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Since the night Vox conversed with me in the dream-vision, he had been
	receiving lucid revelations of his past, his future. I can not say for certain
	what she intends for the young man, but he holds much promise and can only
	assist us in our mission. I have inducted him into the House and look forward
	to divining more of his origin and the fate that surrounds him.</I>
