	      <I>A stern-looking silver of mature age instructed his sons and daughters:
	      &nbsp;"We of the Silver Celare are charged with safeguarding the lesser races
	      from those who would seek their destruction, enslavement, or degradation.
	      &nbsp;Through Claw and Wing, Sword and Staff, Magic and Charms, we fight
	      against those who would destroy that which Io laid down to us." &nbsp;The
	      young dragons, one little more than a hatchling, listened with rapt
	      attention.</I></TD>

	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> Then the end came. In a place where dragon's dwelt in relative peace,
	the magnificent creatures grew idle. Few things managed to hold their attentions
	long. A leader among those dragon's saw doom fast approaching. &nbsp;Taking
	a riven guise, he went among the non-dragons and planted seeds of conflict.
	The first Dragon-Slayers began to emerge. &nbsp;</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>A collective of these creatures, composed of humans and dwarves, assaulted
	the peak in the Treebear Mountains near the center of RhyDin's most-heavily
	populated continent. They wielded magical weapons, specifically &nbsp;designed
	to slay Io's brood. They had no qualms about killing the metallic dragons.
	The service to the people that the silver's had performed was long
	forgotten.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> The three eldest children of ag'Dangeant, ag'Melir, ag'Merjus, and ag'Kinir,
	had one idea in their minds, to ensure the safety of the youngest among them,
	myself, ag'Keldore. Melir, with her powerful evocations, hurled ice and lightning
	towards the attackers. Merjus, brandishing her claws, impaled many of the
	beings to the rocky ground. Kinir, taking an Elven seeming, and wielding
	an ancient holy sword, shielded his siblings from the magical onslaughts
	and cut down many foes. I, young but all ready adept in magic, did what I
	could to slow the slayers. We only delayed the inevitable.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> House Silverwand was outnumbered seven to one. The slayers overwhelmed
	&nbsp;our defenses. A hint of red scale in the sky alerted us to the presence
	of another enemy. The retreat and race for survival was on. Exhausted in
	our magic, we silver dragons took to the sky. Magical arrows were unleashed
	to the clouds, striking down a large number of us. Phos, the red who took
	an increasing interest in the battle, slew more than a few fleeing silvers
	himself. It was not long, however, before a well-aimed lance knocked him
	out of the sky as well.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> There was little hope for any of House Silverwand. Dargeant cursed the
	human and dwarven races, until a black iron battle axe severed his larynx.
	&nbsp;The rest of the battle was a blur to me. My sisters used their limited
	spells, waning reserves, and physical strengths to literally throw my brother
	and I away from the mountain. We awakened to find ourselves in a strange
	place, alone.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> Our adventures were many, my brother's and mine. We traveled the width
	&nbsp;and breadth of the continent, taking different seemings--never human
	or dwarf--and learning about the people. We learned as much as we could from
	a place, then moved on. I grew powerful in the magic of that world, and Kinir
	became a master swordsman. We were happy.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> Suffice it to say, I was very close to my brother. I cannot relate the
	tale of his demise, for it would bring back a depression that I fought long
	and hard against. However, I will tell you, that like a true paladin, he
	died in honor. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> At the age of four hundred eighty-seven, I recovered from my brother's
	death, I decided to settle in a place for a while. I happened upon a small
	kingdom called Cavalyn. The queen, Vitesse, and I grew to be friends, and
	I was appointed to construct a tower of magical learning and research. Mages
	came from all over the continent to study and leave tokens of alliance or
	ill-will to be given to the queen. I joined the Order of the Ebon Hand's
	House of Lore, and renewed my studies. Once again, I was happy.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> It was during my time in Cavalyn that I met a human woman who captured
	my heart as nothing else had. I found it strange that I should be so enraptured
	by a non-dragon, let alone a human. I did not resist her charm, though, and
	after a brief courting period, I was mated to my sweet young Vahnna. We have
	two brilliant and strong children, Kirsha and Jaidon. You might see the latter
	adventuring here with me in Norrath.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> It was also during my time in that peaceful land that I happened to meet
	a very spirited individual, an electrum dragon by the name of Starallon.
	It was he who renewed my interest in other worlds that held so many undiscovered
	wonders. I followed him to Elanthia, but after attempting to utilize that
	world's magic, and falling short, left. I then struck out to Krynn, where
	I found little more success in that war-torn land, and returned to RhyDin.
	&nbsp; </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Starallon then introduced me to the Conclave of the Wyrm on Io's Blood
	Isles. I had heard of this place before, but consigned it to myth. I never
	imagined that I would ever see it, let alone live there. I was disillusioned,
	however. The Conclave was in a state of turmoil, and I left.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> A few years later, I returned, more mature and more advanced in magic,
	and opened myself to the Conclave more fully. I entered the silver city of
	Pinnacle and served under ag'Talisman. I fought in four major conflicts:
	the battle for Starlight Citadel, the Challenge of Claw and Wing, a sea battle
	against a pair of dragon slayers and their fire giant allies, and the Orb
	Winter. I was successful in the first three, but the last was disastrous.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> The Orb Winter followed on the Challenge's heels. The circumstances and
	results of that battle can be read up on in our library, and I will not retell
	that story here today. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> My stay on the continent of Solon was brief. Following the steps of other
	Conclave refugees, I came to the world of Norrath. It seemed an exciting
	new place, and I was attracted by its magic. I was disappointed when I was
	forced into a particular school, and limited in spell choice, but I am making
	due. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> Dirge then formed the House Winterborne to work with Lady Vox to solve
	the problems afflicting Winter's creations. Soon after, I was summoned...</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> <IMG BORDER="0" ALIGN="Middle" WIDTH="510" HEIGHT="19" SRC="bar.gif"></I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>The elf on the docks of Qeynos groaned and stretched after rising. Blinking
	and licking his salted lips, Keldore vaguely remebered how he got here. It
	had something to do with the fishing pole lying on the ground beside him,
	and the empty mead bottles next to it. No use dwelling on the past, he decided.
	Gathering his things, headed for the bank. He didn't like carrying this pole
	around with him.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> Depositing his things, Keldore began planning his day. While scarfing
	down a few nutritious but un-delicious rations, and gulping down an entire
	flask of water, he decided to prey on the gnolls of Blackburrow. They seemed
	to be launching many more frequent and powerful attacks as of late. It was
	probably due to all the so-called adventurers slaughtering them. They deserved
	it though.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> One, two, three, four corpses lie at the entrance to the tunnel joining
	Blackburrow to the Qeynos Hills. A strange site it used to be, but becoming
	all too usual. One, two, three, four corpses pilled up around the wizard,
	felled by his moderately powerful spells and inadequate combat abilities.
	It was a bit exhausting, and Keldore decided to take a break and regather
	his energies, both physical and magical.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> He found a nice corner in the gnoll home, and sat down. His inviting
	spellbook was opened in his lap and he began studying once again. The pages
	began to swirl, but he dismissed it as the lingering effects of last night's
	party. They began to flip wildly, before coming to rest upon those dealing
	with cold and ice. These rose from the pages, nipping at him with their chill.
	While this weak body felt pain, the silver dragon soul within reveled. The
	mind wondered just what was happening.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> The answer came in a voice that was inviting, yet domineering. The rocky
	scape around him faded to a cavern of snow and ice. His feet danced to the
	voice, bringing him to his feet. "Welcome to my home."</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> Keldore found himself staring up at one of the most beautiful sites he
	had yet to see on Norrath. It nearly shattered his heart to see the great
	dragon that loomed over him, the pain of losing his draconic abilities and
	shape still fresh. At once he knew her name, from rumors across the land,
	from annals in the library of Erudin, and from the presence he had felt since
	coming to this world. "Thank you, My Lady Vox."</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> Studying ones spells requires the opening of the mind. Just about anyone
	with the inclination and power to do so could follow the streaming magical
	words, gestures, and patterns into Keldore's brain. He had already been studied
	and accepted, but like the others she had already contacted, he needed to
	be shown the vision and be Winterborne.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> The carnage soon to be wrought in the world was like a hammer blow to
	the wizard, who thought the world was streaming along nicely. The vision
	was not doubted, however. Once the signs were pointed out for him, he could
	see the picture. He accepted the position offered to him by the Lady, happily
	once he learned that some of his friends had done so already.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I> Snapping shut the spellbook and rising, he once again began battling
	the gnolls, this time with a different purpose.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I><IMG BORDER="0" ALIGN="Middle" WIDTH="510" HEIGHT="19" SRC="bar.gif"></I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I continue to gain power in Norrath with the others who have joined the
	House. We are making thorough searches of all locales in the world for any
	information that could lead us to cure the malfunctions in Winter's creations.
	Aside from the problems we face, I am happy.</I>
