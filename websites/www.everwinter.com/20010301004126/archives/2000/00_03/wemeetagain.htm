<I>The pale lady&#146;s brow furrowed and she motioned for Vage to be quiet.
&#147;I know that voice&#133;&#148; Her eyes glazed over in fury when she
saw the Erudite. Shar smacked Vage in the chest, her eyes wide with amazement.
&#147;That&#146;s the meddling woman that was bothering us the other
day!&#148;<BR>
<BR>
In one fluid move, Shar reached down and unsheathed a knife from its place
in her boot and proceeded to close the distance between her and the cleric.
She grabbed the woman by the shoulder, spinning her around, pressing the
knife dangerously close to her eye.<BR>
<BR>
&#147;It&#146;s a bold move, for ye to show your face here, missy,&#148;
Shar sneered. &#147;Who do ye work for? And don&#146;t give me any of that
cryptic mumbo jumbo ye were spewing the other night. It&#146;s time ye came
clean. Ye ain&#146;t among friends here.&#148;</I>

<I>Vage stumbled a bit taken by suprise from the blow..he didnt remember
Shar being that strong...hmm or maybe it was because he was weaker now. Or
perhaps he just wasnt used to this form, it was a big change from what he
had been before and ontop of other things his emotions and mind was all jumbled
up from the inferno hell he has been ressurected from.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He shook his head gathering his bearings, he caught a glimpse of Shar
just in time to see the knife glimmering in the air towards the dark woman.
He sighed nothing he could do...it was too late for a reaction. <BR>
*If I had been as I was before it wouldnt have gotten past me at all* he
thought to himself, but instead he just gave a grin to hide his own shame.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He dropped to one knee the pain in his chest had increased he was out
of breath...he gasped his chest. Seems his new seeming was battered and bruise
from the Dervish Cutthroats last eve and that last hit from Shar didnt make
matters any better. Slowly he got closer and closer to the ground until finally
he couldnt fight anymore and just layed there unconscience....</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin sat deep in the shadows, in a corner behind Sharhel and Vage, watching.
Lady Sharhel was more than a little insensed. And now Vage lay unconcious
on the floor. He was still breathing, so Balkin wasn't all that worried,
he'd get there in a minute.<BR>
<BR>
He had been watching Eglantyne all evening, wondering if he would have to
ask her some rather direct questions, possibly applied with a blade. When
Sharhel and Vage had arrived, Balkin had merely sunk deeper into the shadows,
nursing his ale and watching. He'd removed his armor in his room, in hopes
of being less noticeable, and was now glad for that fact. <BR>
<BR>
He wasn't surprised when Sharhel reacted the way she did. The tall barbarian
woman was very agressive, and did no like to be played with. The flash of
her blade brought a slow smile to his face. Direct, and to the point, as
usual.<BR>
<BR>
Though Balkin was fairly sure that Eglantyne was alone, he thought Sharhel
might like to know someone was guarding her back. He may be without his armor,
but never without his blades. The slow rasp of steel sliding out of leather,
followed by a heavy thump as he slammed one of his Langseax's flat on the
table in front of him, drew the eyes of most of the now quiet
crowd.<BR>
<BR>
Balkin leaned forward, letting his scarred visage come into the light. An
intense stare, and a vicious grin, greeted the crowd as he became visible
to all. In his hard, deep voice he said, "Ye may continue with yer questions
me lady, nae fear for your back. I am here fer ye."</I>

<I>Mhica smiled at Fhallon as she dusted herself off redfaced. No harm, save
perhaps a small bruising of the crystal's ego, had come of her misstep however
Mhica often shadowed the enchanter to be certain her next step did not land
her into trouble she could not handle. He was not sure how the lovely moonskinned
lady viewed his services but then again, he did not much care either: It
was his duty to protect her and he was sworn to that duty.<BR>
<BR>
The dark cleric sneered at the crowd gathered, but got no further as the
tall barbarian woman leapt catlike at the priestess. Mhica watched as the
knife appeared from nowhere to press against the cheek of the
Erudite.<BR>
<BR>
"It's a bold move, for ye to show your face here, missy," Shar sneered. "Who
do ye work for? And don't give me any of that cryptic mumbo jumbo ye were
spewing the other night. It's time ye came clean. Ye ain't among friends
here."<BR>
<BR>
A thumping and scraping of weapons drew the monk's attention to the shadows.
The new dwarven warrior stood solidly behind Shar, ready to lend his blade
should the newcomer try anything. Mhica shot a worried glance towards Fhallon
and was relieved that she was more or less off to the side and not in the
thick of things. The air was beginning to brew with unpleasantness. The monk
hoped to dissuade the coming storm or perhaps redirect it for the house did
not need this kind of attention in their chosen home city.<BR>
<BR>
He moved slowly and with a relaxed air towards the priest and barbarian lady,
his steps light and soundless among the thick tension of the moment. The
few guests near the two ladies had grown quiet as they realized what was
happening and their lack of chatter caught the attention of their neighbors.
The room was settling into an uneasy silence. Mhica gently and slowly laid
an open hand on Shar's knife wrist while placing his body between the cleric
and barbarian. His shoulder brushed up against the erudite as he grounded
his feet firmly on the inn's floor. The trill of anticipated battle hummed
under the white lady's skin.<BR>
<BR>
"Lady Shar, I know not this one's crime but this is not the place or the
way to deal with it. Put down your blade for the moment and perhaps we can
resolve this in a more suitable fashion." <BR>
<BR>
He spoke low and kept his gaze locked with Shar's. He could feel the Cleric
through the thin fabric of his gi and kept his awareness on both women should
one or the other make an unexpected move. He only hoped that the guards were
busy elsewhere for as long as this altercation was going to take. It would
be a black mark indeed upon the house if Winterborne was thrown out of town
on the eve of Saidar and Flutrose's engagement announcement.</I>

<I><FONT COLOR="#8080ff">Posted by Eglantyne on March 31, 2000:</FONT></I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Eglantyne felt the cold steel of Sharhel's blade against her cheek, its
tip a mere fraction from her eye. Inwardly she laughed. Such a typically
female reaction! And so if she lost an eye, what did it matter? A male would
have had the good sense to apply his blade to her throat, where it could
do some real damage.<BR>
<BR>
She searched within the Barbarian, and only rage was present. That did not
surprise Eglantyne. She doubted the barbarian had the capacity to feel more
than a single emotion at one time. Extending her search to the others in
the room, she felt anger, hostility, curiosity, and even a little fear -
but to the monk's credit, he hid it well. <BR>
<BR>
"I already answered those questions, wench. I am Eglantyne. I serve no man,
no god, no winged beasts. Only myself."<BR>
<BR>
Eglantyne's gaze landed upon Vage - he who was cursed with losing his dragon
seeming and forced to wander Norrath in guises that were more or less of
humanoid form. Her mind opened, and she felt pain. Intense pain.<BR>
<BR>
The cleric smiled to herself. She had wanted to draw the attention of the
Winterborne, and it appeared that she had admirably succeeded. <BR>
<BR>
She was not concerned with her present predicament. Her safety was already
assured, though they knew it not.<BR>
<BR>
Eglantyne spoke again to Sharhel, the armor of the wench digging into her
back and slightly scratching her skin. Her voice rang loud and clear, with
no inflections of fear contained within. "Sharhel, look upon your old esteemed
Vage. He lays upon the floor near you, near dead from pain, and yet you waste
your time concerning yourself with me."<BR>
<BR>
Every pair of eyes in the room swung to the corner where Vage lay writhing
in pain, obvlivious to his surroundings. A collective gasp arose and Eglantyne
felt the barbarian's hold upon her loosen. Sharhel and her companions made
one step towards Vage, and Eglantyne took advantage of the opportunity. She
quickly slipped from her grasp and fled the room while everyone's attention
was diverted elsewhere.<BR>
<BR>
Speeding quickly to the snake and rat-infested land surrounding the city,
she collapsed against the wall, laughing with joy and a little relief. Aye,
her plans were progressing even better than she had hoped.</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The voice came from high above, rolling down the height of the wall with
a gruff laugh. "Nice company ya keep." At the peak of the ten feet high rough
stone wall Eglantyne leaned against, a bronze-clad barbarian perched. With
one smooth motion, he leapt down holding a bone-bladed claymore effortlessly
in one large hand. Dropping down, he drove the point of the blade into a
sewer rat that scurried away from the man&#146;s over-sized sabatons. It
squealed, snapping at the blade, and expired. All the time, he kept his one
good eye focused on the Erudite.<BR>
<BR>
"Rats will fight when there cornered, lass. It&#146;s easy enough to arrange
for ya ta find yerself in a corner." He grinned slightly, hefting the blade
over his shoulder. "Not everyone at the guild-house was distracted by
Vage&#146;s frail constitution." He rubbed the stubble on his face with his
free-hand.<BR>
<BR>
"Now lets chat." He narrowed his eye. "And don&#146;t bother running. If
ya can dodge my sword, ye&#146;ll still get an arrow or a spell. I don&#146;t
ever travel alone."</I>

<I>Mhica had seen the half elf crumple to the ground and had spared enough
awareness to find that he was neither getting up nor posing a threat. The
monk moved this knowledge to a lower priority in his mind; not forgetting
it entirely but suppressing it in favor of concentrating on the two women
on either side of him. Shar he watched as well as felt through the contact
on her wrist. She was by far the more formidable opponent and the monk knew
that if push came to shove she would probably best him. Still, he had to
try to maintain a peace until this dispute could be settled accordingly and
in observation of the town rules. The cleric he had little fear of, even
to the point of turning his back to her. Not the most secure position nor
the wisest one he could think of but he could feel her tenseness through
his shoulder and knew by that contact where she was and what she was doing.
If she moved he would know and respond faster than one would
think.<BR>
<BR>
The cleric sneered and attempted a diversion by drawing attention to the
crumpled man. Some people looked and were startled to find the ranger collapsed
on the floor but then those people were not in the immediate thick of things
and did not possess warrior instincts. A few took a step towards the stricken
halfelf and the cleric took the opportunity to escape. Mhica felt the shift
in weight as she turned and he smoothly turned with her, stepping back almost
into Shar to give himself some distance and switching the hand covering the
shaman so he was not completely crossed up. He faced the cleric, left hand
held loosely in front of him while his right hand stayed with Shar. It meant
turning his back now to the barbarian; but the Erudite had upped the anti
by initiating the first offence. To his amazement, she skittered out of the
inn laughing. He watched her go with a perplexed stare, then shrugged as
he relaxed his stance. <BR>
<BR>
"Lady Shar, should you need any company in escorting that woman to the arena
I would gladly offer my services. She might need to learn a thing or two
about Winterborne and the training grounds are an excellent place to explain
such things to youngsters." He turned back to the tall northern woman and
gave her a half bow. <BR>
<BR>
The monk scanned the crowd for Fhallon and found her more or less where he
had last seen her. He moved to join her as the people now turned to the downed
ranger.</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Eglantyne whirled and faced one of the ugliest men she had ever seen.
A barbarian, covered with scars, an eye patch covering the puckered hole
where an eye used to reside. How appropriate, she thought. This is what Sharhel
would have me look like.<BR>
<BR>
"Now lets chat." He narrowed his eye. "And don't bother running. If ya can
dodge my sword, ye'll still get an arrow or a spell. I don't ever travel
alone."<BR>
<BR>
Although Tanner gave the impression of studied casualness, Eglantyne knew
that he watched her tiniest movement like a griffon eyes its prey. He had
no wish to harm her, else he would have already done so; of this she was
certain.<BR>
<BR>
Tanner lowered his claymore from his shoulder to his side, the muscles holding
it in a relaxed fashion, yet ready to pounce in an instant. "Quit playin'
games,lass. Why do ya pester everyone about how they're feelin'? Ya tryin'
to start trouble?" <BR>
<BR>
Eglantyne looked at him intently. "Because I sense what they feel. And it
amuses me to see how many of them lie to me, even try to lie to themselves."
The barbarian's eye gleamed. "Bah" he said. "Ye weren't born when half this
crap they're fussin' over happened."<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
"That is quite true. But the bonds of time do not erase feelings. They erase
the current events, the physical happenings, that is true, but the feelings
remain. They may be deep, they may have many stone layers around them, but
they still exist." <BR>
<BR>
Tanner rubbed the stubble on his chin while he considered this answer. His
voice became hard, insistent. "How do ya feel these things?" Eglantyne shrugged.
"I do not know 'how.' You might as well ask me how I know my name or that
I am female. It simply 'is.' And once I sense a feeling, often I can also
'sense' the incident or circumstance that caused the feeling. Not always,
but sometimes. It just happens."<BR>
<BR>
The barbarian snorted, perhaps in disbelief. "Why do ya toy with people?"
Eglantyne shrugged again. "Because it amuses me to do so."<BR>
<BR>
Eglantyne felt a miasma begin to interfere with her body and mind. Everything
seemed to dip, to swirl, to become slightly out of focus. She tried to move,
but was unable to force even her eyelids to do her bidding. A voice from
behind her spoke.<BR>
<BR>
"Eglantyne. Ye are hereby charged with the murder of Kenials, Cleric of
Quellious. Ye will be taken before the High Council of Erudin and there stand
judgement for your crime." A cloud of silver smoke swirled around her, and
she disappeared.</I>

<I>Shar looked on as Jyntari carried Vega away. She shook her head in disgust
and turned in time to see the robes of the Erudite disappear around the corner.
Turning to Mhica, the pale lady sneered, "I should've run her through when
I had the chance, asked questions later."<BR>
<BR>
Fallon brushed the dust from her skirts, "Shar, dearest, I believe she is
possibly Winterborne. Like ye, she also asked a lot of questions of me. When
I asked her how she fared, she was taken aback, I think. For all of her
discussions with other members were quite offensive, I think. I was the first
to show concern for her welfare."<BR>
<BR>
Shar snorted. "Well, I can be polite enough when a situation calls for it.
I assure ye. But this lout was mocking who we were, speaking ambiguously
about things I'm sure she only knows a part of. Scare tactics don't sit well
with me. Ye know that. And if she's toying with me for amusement's sake&#133;"
The barbarian witch laughed bitterly. "Well, I'm always up for a good game."
Shar smiled snidely toward Fallon and turned to follow the
Erudite.<BR>
<BR>
"Eglantyne. Ye are hereby charged with the murder of Kenials, Cleric of
Quellious. Ye will be taken before the High Council of Erudin and there stand
judgement for your crime." A cloud of silver smoke swirled around her, and
she disappeared.<BR>
<BR>
"Well, well. It looks like I'm not the only one that wants to see her head
on a platter. Murder?" The pale lady put an unadorned hand to her lips,
mockingly. "Why, would ye have ever suspected such a thing?"<BR>
<BR>
Fallon put a hand on Shar's arm. "But wait. If she is Winterborne, no harm
must come to her."<BR>
<BR>
Shar looked steadily into the crystal's pleading eyes. "Oh, I'm not so sure
about that. Maybe your reaction is just what she was hoping for. Who knows
what she's up to? Maybe she set this whole thing up so we'd follow her back
to Erudin to rescue her from certain death. We don't owe her
anything."<BR>
<BR>
"Ummm&#133;" Fallon hesitated, "I don't think so. I think she came to us
for a reason. It's a cry for help, one we should answer. The poor dear was
merely looking for kin. Did anyone check to see if she was an animation?"
Fallon looked to everyone with imploring, doleful eyes, all the while wringing
her hands together.</I>

<I>Tanner sneered as the power of the clerics stole Eglantyne away from his
questions. "Yeah, always leaving the party when it gets interestin&#146;&#133;
that&#146;s the rule o&#146; Norrath." He turned towards Shar, who apparently
had followed the erudite, Fallon in tow. He motioned towards his concealed
reinforcement, then strutted over to the two women.<BR>
<BR>
Shar towered over the mousy Fallon&#151;the lass who was a fine cook, but
perpetually reminded the warrior of a nurse maid. He had teased her ruthlessly
when she studied with Saphrael in Saerloon. A wizard? She would rather be
sowing than mastering a spell! The pale lady, his "sister" if the rumors
were true, didn&#146;t sit well with him either; she was an unpredictable
dilettante, a bit touched in the brain&#151;not a warrior.<BR>
<BR>
He caught Fallon&#146;s question, and picked up the conversation. "Nah, I
didn&#146;t get a read on her, but that&#146;s a damn piss-poor way t&#146;
get someone&#146;s attention. Ya don&#146;t crap where ya want t&#146; roost,
ya know? Just makes sense, right?"</I>
