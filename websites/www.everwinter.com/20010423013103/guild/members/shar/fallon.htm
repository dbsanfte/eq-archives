	    <TD><I>The dazzling crystal rapped on Windheavin&#146;s door. Her clothes
	      were torn and dirty. Her normally pale blue skin was taking on an odd copper
	      hue and was rather weathered looking from the wind and sun. The trek from
	      Lake Kiij to the new Aerie was a long and frightful one, but with Orgrum&#146;s
	      assistance, she knew it had been much easier going than it could have been.</I></TD>

	<I>"Fallon, ye&#146;ve returned!" Maddie, the young selkie, opened the door
	and threw her arms around Fallon, squeezing her sparkling green eyes shut
	tight, fearing Fallon might dissipate before her eyes&#133;again. Fallon
	hugged Maddie back and smoothed her gray-blonde hair. She smelled faintly
	of peppermint and gardenia. "Maddie, darling, I am returned. Have no fear
	of that, child." Fallon struggled to be attentive to the young girl, but
	so many things had changed. Normally, she&#146;d fret over every little thing
	about the selkie, from whether she was eating enough to who was mending her
	clothes while she was away. This time though, she was too weary to dwell
	on anything beyond the girl&#146;s safety. She&#146;d made it safely to the
	Aerie and was under Windheavin&#146;s care. That was enough for Fallon. She
	cradled Maddie&#146;s face in her hands, "Is Windheavin in, child?" </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"Yes, ma&#146;am. Last I spoke with him, he was in his study, researching
	some new maps of Norrath he came across." Maddie saw Fallon look around and
	realized this was her first time at the new Aerie. "I can show ye to the
	study, m&#146;lady." The young selkie&#146;s eyes lit up. She held hands
	with Fallon and walked her through a series of adjoining receiving rooms
	and corridors until she finally reached an etched crystal door that almost
	reached the top of the vaulted ceiling. The designs on the door were beautiful,
	visions of Windheavin&#146;s no doubt. Whether or not he was actually the
	one to fashion the door, Fallon was certain he&#146;d had some input on the
	design. She smiled approvingly and followed Maddie into the study. A study
	wasn&#146;t what Fallon would&#146;ve called it though. On a much grander
	scale, this study was a full-fledged library. There were aisles and aisles
	of books, neatly organized. Fallon mused over who had the delightful task
	of organizing them. She walked down the main aisle, scanning the titles on
	the shelves and running a finger over the bindings. As she moved down the
	aisle, she noticed a halfling stooped precariously on a table looking over
	a pile of papers. She nodded to Maddie, who quietly returned the way they
	had come. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Fallon walked down the aisle to where the halfling was sitting. "Brother,
	it has been ages upon ages that I&#146;ve seen ye take on thy seeming. Nae,
	would I say it doth not become thee. For it does. Tis just a bit surprising."
	Fallon&#146;s eyes welled over with tears and she knelt over and hugged
	Windheavin. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"Fallon, aren&#146;tcha a sight fer sore eyes! Heh, even in rags, you&#146;re
	still the pinnacle of beauty. Welcome home, lass! Been keepin&#146; an eye
	on the search parties that&#146;re out lookin&#146; fer ya and some other
	folks who missed the Spire. I knew ya&#146;d make it back safe and sound
	though." Windheavin beamed. "Care for some tea?" </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>The dazzling crystal choked back the tears, "That would be divine,
	m&#146;lord." </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Over hot cups of tea, Windheavin, the Lord of Clan Starlight, shared the
	news of all that had happened within the Conclave while Fallon was away.
	Fallon&#146;s normally cheerful visage was clouded with worry. She&#146;d
	heard a few rumors upon her arrival at the Aerie, which was why she came
	to see Windheavin straight away. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"It&#146;s been pretty peaceful here on Solon, things remaining quiet,
	as most of the rabble rousers of the Conclave have left to seek adventure
	in the land of Norrath." Windheavin chortled to himself and sipped his tea.
	"That&#146;s the reason I came back here. I don&#146;t get a moment&#146;s
	peace in Norrath! Mind ye, I don&#146;t mind, I rather like all the company.
	There&#146;s never a dull moment with our guild brethren. But sometimes,
	sometimes, even I need a moment&#146;s rest from the daily rigmarole of the
	guild." </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"Aye, I was told ye were in charge of the guild there. I also heard thou
	art a fine leader there. Everyone has taken a shine to thee. Not to say there
	would be any doubt, m&#146;lord. Ye&#146;ve been with the Conclave since
	long before myself. Ye&#146;ve come to know what it means to be a part of
	this family. It is pleasing to see that ye&#146;ve found kindred spirits
	in the new realm of Norrath to take under our wing." </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Windheavin sighed heavily then. Fallon noted earlier that the Crystal
	Lord seemed rather pensive. His sigh confirmed it. "What else is there,
	m&#146;lord? I have heard things. Tis the real reason I&#146;ve come. I fear
	ye carry a heavy burden, more so than mere leadership duties of our fine
	guild. Do tell, m&#146;lord, that I may ease that burden in some way." </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"Oh, Fallon, ya always were the doting one." Windheavin patted Fallon&#146;s
	hand warmly and looked into her eyes. The sadness she found in his was
	overwhelming. "I got this note here from Dirge the other day." He pulled
	a wrinkled piece of parchment from his coat. "Seems him and a few others
	realized their calling and it doesn&#146;t involve the Conclave. And after
	a lot of thought, they&#146;ve decided to part with the Conclave and apply
	themselves to their new goals in Norrath. Ole Dirge has handed me the torch,
	if ya will. I gotta tell ya, Fallon, we were all quite surprised by this
	whole turn of events." </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Fallon grasped absently at the pendant around her neck and stared at the
	scattered maps on the table, not seeing any of them. "As am I,
	m&#146;lord&#133;as am I." After a moment of silence, she lifted her head
	and frowned questioningly at Windheavin. "Did he name those that would be
	leaving with him?" </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Fallon&#146;s anxious look pained Windheavin. He knew how close she was
	to Shar. Would she also leave to be near her charge? He sighed again, "Aye,
	and Shar was counted among them, o&#146;course. I am sure ya would be welcome
	to join their ranks if ya wish to be near her. I know how much she means
	to ya." </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>For a moment, Fallon sat in a stupor. My, how things could be turned inside
	out in such little time, she thought. Had she been gone so long? What brought
	this about? Who else was leaving? Were they now the Conclave&#146;s ally
	or enemy? If their goals had changed so much, perhaps they would be enemies.
	There were so many strange things to this she simply could not reconcile.
	</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Finally, Fallon smiled softly at Windheavin. A frown clouded her coppery
	blue face. "That is most gracious of thee, brother. I wish there was but
	another choice. I care not to leave ye, though I am torn&#133;" </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>She turned her head then and watched the sunlight play upon the beautiful
	stained glass panels that surrounded the top of the walls of the library.
	Windheavin understood and sat in silence until she was ready to speak again.
	After a cleansing sigh, she looked at Windheavin, her beloved brother.
	"Windheavin&#133;I&#133;I am exhausted from my journey from Guntu, a tale
	I&#146;ve yet to share with thee. But I must not tarry until I speak with
	Shar and the others. I really must know the reasons behind this faction."
	</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>The dazzling crystal bowed before the halfling lord, kissing the back
	of his hand lightly. Her silent tears did not go unnoticed. "I understand,
	dear Fallon. I understand."</I>
