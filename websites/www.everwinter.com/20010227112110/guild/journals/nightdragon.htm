	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>How many ages have past since I first began running? I can no longer count
	the years, fled as I flee. The Night Dragon pursues me as death pursues the
	lesser races, infecting all I hold dear. I am the living refutation of his
	faith. My existence is an anathema to him, a role I chose over eternal slavery.
	Our race is beyond such toil, though the Elders of our kind would have ye
	believe otherwise. His worship rises among the clans I have nae
	influenced&#151;Blackwater, Boghold, Nighthunt, and Nightshriek. Lurker wavers
	and Mire survives only because I drove off Inferius, already a servant of
	the Night Dragon, no doubt intent on the title I abandoned. Only Blackmoon
	remembers his treachery, understands the corruption of what he offers.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>But that is far away, back in the Isles. In Neverwinter, his claws rend
	me in a differently, though more deeply. Vespre has succumbed to his foul
	rot, though she died believing it was the punishment for any
	Teir&#146;Dal&#151;the name for the dark elves in her land of Norrath&#151;who
	went against the will of Innoruuk. I know the truth, heard the shout of his
	clergy. Call him the Despoiler, the Father of Hate and Undeath&#133; whatever
	the case, Faluzure the Night Dragon and Innoruuk are the same. He stole my
	love, tortured her for supporting me. And for that must I find a way to elude
	him, defeat him.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>On the wake of her death, I feel desperate. Who would follow? I shall
	brave his rotting lair and play my hand against his bloated, degenerate might.
	I have warned my brethren in this exiled Council, but many show their metallic
	natures&#151;brave past the call of bravery. And I ask, who am I to wave
	them away from the battle? The Night Dragon is as wrong to their senses as
	it is to mine, though the matter is personal. How can they hope to distract
	him long enough?</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>And what of this young body, this op&#146;Lokisun, brother of Eclipsed
	and exile from the land of the dark elves? Their love, though wrought malignant
	incest, is as true as any I&#146;ve seen&#133; but he would have perished
	were it not for my will. His life is mine to borrow, a life that bares part
	of my essence and would die without it. She will hate me more than any other
	is capable of, and yet if I should perish, what future would await her, Loki,
	or any of our kind? Surely death would be a release from the alternative
	I have lived&#133; hopeless servitude in an order of oppressive decay.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>And still, the doubt nags at me. Am I truly important or is my defiance
	merely a reflection of my nature. As a red must be the bully, am I defined
	by my spite? I have tried to enlighten my race, and yet I am heralded as
	doom-incarnate, a bad omen to scare vassals and hatchlings, a reviled villain
	among the grown. They call me the Dark Song, a lament of what even the most
	morbid of my scaled race can spawn. And so, I embrace this dirge that I have
	become. I hear it striving against the cacophony of the chaotic urges of
	the Night Dragon, ever hungry, ever eating. My power is born of will, nae
	the bondage of faith. If this makes me singer of the elegy that ends the
	Elders&#146; deception, than so be it. I will bare the weight.</I>

	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>Amid the rot, the darkness, the rancid abominations Faluzure does surround
	himself with, a wing of the most true wyrms did wing. I cannot speak of the
	powers unleashed, save cn&#146;Olam Cz possesses a strength he is nae aware
	of. I felt it emanating from him, the essence of life beholden to no
	would-be-god. The mithral revealed, au&#146;Johan Graye, still bearing his
	human name and heritage, swung a blade imbued with the incarnation of justice.
	He was gleaming in a light of weal and, though he be my friend, I had to
	avert my gaze in the brightness. And amid the nobility of these two, I watched
	ru&#146;Rianna Blisterclaw, the one I willingly called Queen.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>What can I say of her the legends won&#146;t prey upon? She is grace,
	wisdom, fervor, and soul given scales. She faced the Night Dragon as I did,
	allowing me time to wound him. It was as I had told them, thought the pestilence
	that surged from his damage body consumed the last of my form and tainted
	her. I shall touch upon what I fear later. For now, suffice it to say,
	dr&#146;Shivreheldespaire, once servant of Faluzure and Lord of the Under
	Hel, is dead to the world.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>I fled into op&#146;Lokisun&#146;s body, eluding the undead servants,
	the foul dracoliches, of the Night Dragon. The topaz was nothing if nae a
	nimble and evasive rogue. Into the astral we shifted, my personality dominating
	what survived his soul-leeching in the Gray Wastes. I tracked the color pool
	that would take me to Toril, free at long last from Faluzure&#133; and there
	she was.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>Chronepsis, goddess of our time upon the planes, speechless since her
	rape by her brother&#133; she who amid the screech of despair gave birth
	to the First Borne&#133; my mother. She gazed upon Loki&#146;s form, but
	into my eyes, the child that had claimed his Hour Glass before his time,
	the child who had stole his immortality. I cannot give words to the feeling,
	but my soul, whatever it&#146;s fate, was torn from the body I inhabited,
	destroyed in a swell of purging fire that left Loki alive and free of me&#133;
	and the skeletal form of me floating in the waves of the color pools, a hollow
	husk.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>Then, ye ask, how is it my pen still moves, still labors to move thought
	from mind to parchment? I claim a miracle, by Io&#146;s will. Beyond the
	Elder powers, the ancient among our race, even more ancient than me, there
	is a force&#133; perhaps a God, though more likely the very will behind the
	universe&#133; and that force has chosen me establish the Order that shall
	be the last buttress against the slavery of life. I claim I am the Dirge,
	the song that speaks of lament for resolution. I have be slain by the most
	powerful of those who claim to be divine&#133; and I survive, arisen without
	soul to be sold to these mocking powers.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>So this is the my self-birth, the emergence of a stronger dragon. Let
	the world dance to my song. Every land the slavery oppresses&#133; I shall
	infiltrate, quietly at first, then building volume as the tempo increases.
	Against the chaos, I shall stand.</I>

	    <TD><I>His quarters in the Aerie were dark, as befit his nature. He kept
	      the candles burning, refusing to use glow gems, even those that flickered
	      with the dullness of muted faerie fire. He preferred the simplicity of the
	      candles, the erratic games between the flickering light and evasive shadow.
	      His walls were a mural of woven silhouettes, a quilt work of shade and the
	      yellowed offspring of fire and wax.</I></TD>

	<I>Dirge tugged on his slender finger, twisting a phantom ring. He looked
	down and frowned. Violet eyes regarded the bare finger with a coldness rivven
	would have found terrifying in its depth. He leaned back, tilting his head
	and closing those purpled irises. He sighed to himself. Exhalations were
	a delight to a wracked, aged seeming.</I>
	<P>
	<I>The dark elf thought back on the past few days, questioning himself, and
	following the dream-path to the inevitable conclusion, staring at a crude
	painting he brushed.</I>

	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>Turning from the lights of the tree, Rianna pulled her cloak about her
	form and motioned with her head for Dirge to follow. Striding quickly to
	the slightly open door of the hall she stepped out and stood for a moment
	in the light of the moon. Taking a deep breath to brace herself, she swept
	her hands open and allowed her true form to take it's proper place.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>Dirge noticed the brass scales, the firm length of wing, and yet there
	was also a noticeable absence of the power that used to surround her. Her
	scales did not gleam with the shine that they used to, her golden eyes seemed
	almost sunken in her massive head. The movement of her wings was almost too
	fast to watch, and yet to his eyes, they were slow, lethargic. Saying nothing,
	keeping his thoughts to himself as he was prone to do, he took his own form
	beside her.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>The wind that whipped through the hall at their leaving swirled the faerie
	lights about the tree and brought another twinkle of bells to those in the
	hall..</I>.

	<I>The night had dropped the temperature and Rose was beginning to shiver.
	The fire had died down a bit. Returning with more kindling wood, Mel got
	the fire roaring once again. Johan was in a fitful rest. Rose slept quietly.
	She knew she was strong enough today to fly Johan back to the castle, but
	she could not carry both and leaving her daughter for even a moment scared
	her to death. She had to wait. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>She could feel Dirge and Rianna as they searched. There presence grew
	stronger and Mel reached for them. Linking minds she told them of her location.
	Before long she was hugging her brother and sister. Even the coolness of
	Dirge felt warm to her. "What can we do to help?" Rianna whispered. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>"We can mend them better at Castle Graye. Johan is stable enough to carry
	now," Mel replied. Dirge bent over the sleeping Rose and softly cradled her
	into his arms. His white hair surrounding her slight form as he bent over
	her. "We shall not fly" he smiled and in a wave of magic and the rush of
	displaced air, he was gone.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>"Show off." Mel looked at Rianna. "Sister I am too weak for such a use
	of magic. Can you take Johan? I will simply fly back." </I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>Rianna hesitated. "We can fly together" " </I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>"No, Johan can use the aid quickly and I will be fine from here."</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>Red knew there was no use. She nodded and gathered Johan in her arms.
	"But Mel, How did you get her in this shape?" </I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>"I shall tell you at the castle" Red nodded and was gone.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>With her family cared for, the worry slipped away from her mind as she
	shifted and soared above the tree line... to the castle she headed...</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<IMG WIDTH="510" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="Middle" BORDER="0" SRC="bar.gif">
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>The dark elf set little Rose in her quarters. His cock-eyed smile was
	a contrast to his sharp features. Dirge winked at Rose, putting the tip of
	his black nailed finger into her little fist. She squeezed and sent him a
	thought-scene. **Your cold!**</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>He chuckled. His replied with a gentle thought. **And thou art sweet,
	little one. Thy mother and father are well. They wilst be with thee soon,
	Rose.**</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>**Daddy!**</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>Dirge grinned despite himself. He thought of the burly warrior known as
	Earl Graye being called "Daddy". It was&#133; immeasurably&#133; warm. **Thy
	daddy misses thee, too, little one, but he&#146;ll be tickling thee soon
	enough.**</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>He pulled the homespun up, tucking the child in her crib of solid gold.
	Stepping away from the crib, he noticed a tiny insect perched on one bar.
	He smiled to himself. **Take good care of her, Calmire**</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>The dark elf stepped from the room and pulled the anima tightly around
	him, like he had the blanket around Rose. He stepped into the rift, reappearing
	hundreds of miles to the north, deep in the Moondark Mountains, in the Aerie.
	He strode through the draconian-sized halls, fragile among their towering
	pillars and the ancient throne.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>His caverns were rather spartan compared to the lush lairs some of the
	wyrms maintained. They were simple and sized for a rivven, not a dragon.
	The oaken door opened inward&#133;</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>Compared to his stable-adjacent quarters at Castle Graye, his suite in
	the Aerie was an improvement, but that was simply due to the grand scale
	of the home of the dragons. As in the Castle, a desk was the focus of the
	room, and like the Terran Greeks had kept their focus burning, at all costs,
	his desk was the altar devoted to a single, ever-burning candle. Two spirals
	of an unknown mineral floated about the candle, like Moebius-strip Ioun stones.
	In truth, the two stones were gifts from a three-millennium dead mage, Congenio
	Ioun. They were a reward to Dirge, who had served to aid the faern. He kept
	their powers hidden, never knowing when they might aid him.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>He walled around the room, looking intently over the many cases of books.
	The titles were diverse and obscure: Nadul Daroni&#146;s Sketches of High
	Horn. Briel&#146;s Book of Shadows. The Pages of Pain. Alphon&#146;s Eyes,
	Visions, and Arcane Sight. The Fiendomicon of Iggwilv. The Lost History of
	V&#146;elddrinnshar. Libram of Twelve Seals.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>Instead of choosing one of the tomes, he regarded the bottles stored above
	the shelves. His selections of wines were as vast and baffling as his books.
	Finally he paused, remembering the recent delivery made by a certain elf
	from the Sword Sheath Clan. He turned, and squinted at the note on the keg,
	grinning. "Ah, this will do quite nicely." His voice was a whisper, deep
	and as dark as the unnatural shadows in the room.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<IMG WIDTH="510" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="Middle" BORDER="0" SRC="bar.gif">
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>His door almost burst from the frame as burly Olam plunged into his quarters.
	"Dirge&#133; you better come to the Grand Hall. This is&#133; important."
	His face was tight with pain. The dark elf was accustomed to the Elder&#146;s
	outbursts, but the great bronze was rarely so urgent. He dealt with problems
	in his own brash manner. He followed the armored man out, into the gargantuan
	great room. It took him a moment to take in the situation&#133;</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>The dragons were assembled in their various seemings, a collective look
	of profound sadness on their faces. Rianna sat in her throne. The dark elf
	could see the length of her hair, the nape of her neck. He looked to Olam,
	but his friend was silent. Rianna stood, her voice softer than he could
	remember.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>"My kin, I have kept much from ye these last few months, and ye are deserving
	of an answer..."</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>Sighing deeply, she whispered a word of magic and dropped the illusion
	she had maintained for the last few months. Her sunken eyes and brass scales
	were spotted with large black areas of decay&#133; the true nature of her
	sickness.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>No one could see the narrowing of Dirge&#146;s eyes, the extent of his
	pain.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>"I am dying. I have been dying. It has been a long and hard winter for
	me. I have led this Council for many months and now find myself weak with
	age, worry, and frustration, as well as afflicted with this illness. I have
	searched long and hard for a cure, and as yet I have not found one. I have
	hope that I will find one somewhere on Faerun, but it will require a very
	long journey for me. During that time I will be unable to maintain even the
	limited contact I have had with the Council.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>"It is therefore in the best interest of this council that I step down
	from my position. I have great faith in the leader that shall take my
	place."</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>She motioned to Dirge. His expression was hidden under the mass of unruly
	white hair. Olam could see, though, though he had no need of looking. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>"Dirge shall take over the mantle of leadership and all that it entails.
	It is my hope that this transition will be easy for all of you. Olam will
	also aid in this transition. It is my belief that the Council can move forward
	in the manner that we have wished it to, and with the advent of all the new
	dragons this shall open up more possibilities for everyone. I shall begin
	my journey as soon as the changes seem stable. May you all have great adventures
	and profitable travels. Perhaps someday when I have found a cure for that
	which is ailing me I will return."</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>The great bronze hugged his queen and kissed her cheek. He'd seen the
	things she'd hidden from the others and fought back the tears that swelled
	forward.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>"My queen, I know this is Io's will and I hope he shall guide you in all
	you do. I hope you find your cure and your return is swift."</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>He looked to Dirge, and continued, but the pain was evident. "My loyalty
	is to the Council, you have my concurrence." Was it blame in his words? If
	it was Dirge could not hold that ill will against him. He had earned it.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>The dark elf looked down, his eyes brimming with tears of blood. "Sister,
	it is with a grave heart I accept this post. I hold if for thee and long
	for thy cure. Ye know I will do all I can for the Council, whilst thou art
	gone. Not for my fellow dragons. Not for myself. Not for the Will of Io.
	For thee, thee, thee..." He turned, and walked back to his simple quarters
	in the Aerie, his skeletal shoulders swaying to the dirge that only he
	heard.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>Nodding to each dragon as she passed, Rianna walked slowly through the
	halls and to her quarters, to begin the packing for the long travels that
	lay ahead. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>A soft knock was heard upon the Queen's door. At the soft greeting, Johan
	and the pale figure of her mentor, he who was called White Leopard by the
	brass clans, entered the chamber of their Queen. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>The Earl spoke, trying to console her. "Rianna, thou doth know Melody
	and I shalt sorely miss thee. Remember lass all things art possible in this
	land if thou doth have enough faith. Thou wilt be in me prayers." He kissed
	her brow lightly, looked to White, and left, closing the door behind him.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>Leopard had never been a talkative one, but the tension brought words
	to his reticent lips. "My queen? I am saddened by what has happened, but
	I am even more saddened that you did not confide in me. We have been through
	much together in the past and so I ask a humble favor from you before you
	leave. Allow me to go with you as your guard. There are many out there who
	would take advantage of you present condition and I could not live with myself
	if I just watched you leave without a companion and friend whom to share
	your long and difficult journey. Will you grant me this one favor, my
	queen?"</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>She nodded, and they packed in silence.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<IMG WIDTH="510" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="Middle" BORDER="0" SRC="bar.gif">
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>Sighing deeply as she stood before the final gates to leave, Rianna addressed
	all of those who had come with their wishes. Many stood and fought the tears,
	some showing anger, and some shock. "My kin, it was with great sadness that
	I made the decision to leave. I have no wish to do so, and yet I cannot risk
	any getting the illness that I have. It is for the good of all dragons, the
	truth I have stood behind in these many years, that I do this. When I have
	gained the cure I shall return. I shall keep in touch as I am able. I will
	retain the link granted me by the will of Io and will truly miss you all."</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>She looked to White, standing to the side. "My brother, long have we fought
	together, I can still recall the day you found and brought me here. I will
	not deny thy request, for surely I shall need you in the days that come.
	As my illness brings me down I shall need thy strength. I humbly accept thy
	request, and know that we shall return together, strong once again, on some
	future day."</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>She motioned to all the new dragons. "There are many that will come forward
	in the days ahead to take up the mantles we are leaving behind. The council
	shall ever remain strong with the blood of these new ones. I wish each of
	you safe journeys...."</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>A final tear cut its way down her cheek and Rianna stepped next to Leopard,
	beginning her long journey. Olam clenched his fists and bit back a howl of
	anger against the sense of futility. In the shadows not so far from the archer,
	Dirge&#146;s malevolent violet eyes were shut tightly, but he saw it all&#133;
	and felt the heart slip from the Council.</I>

	<I>Here I am, alone and left with a mantle of leadership. My dearest, this
	is the fate I have brought upon your head. What can come of this but the
	death of the Conclave? I have faith in Olam, in my own resilience, but what
	of these young ones? I am no parent, no King to her Queen. I can nae nurture
	them, urge them to grow. I am know of deception, diligence, surveillance,
	and the enforcement of edict, nae the art of motivation. I am nae a mother!
	Look at the mess I&#146;ve wrought with my children&#133;</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>So what has come of our conflict with the Night Dragon? My sister is gone,
	infected and self-exiled from the very Council she gave life to. Olam and
	I are left, a pair of warriors without a visible enemy to fight. I know combat,
	the very heart of conflict, how to find the flaw and exploit it, be it in
	armor, a spell, a person, or a guild that opposes us, but this&#133;</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>Will the Council break under my hand? Will it be a case of many spoiled,

	<I>I sat among the shadows in the Great Hall today and all I heard was noise,
	meaningless noise. They speak of other lands, and I find myself looking to
	the future. The signs are here. The chaos is sweeping over Neverwinter, undoing
	that which her residents have so carefully wrought. Perhaps its time has
	past. Surely, another land such as this awaits us&#133; and yet here I want
	to remain, a ruin amid ruins&#133; forgotten.</I>

	<I>Would that be selfish, allowing myself such a rest? Honor dictates I do
	what Rianna would have done, so I shall lead them to these lands of Khanduras
	and Sosaria, though neither particularly appeals to me. Ah, dearest sister,
	this is what my desperation breeds&#133; I have cursed you as surely as if
	I had continued the flight from the Night Dragon and brought ruin upon that
	which I cared for.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>I find myself growing aloof, estranged from the exiles that gave breath
	to this Council. They did not toil at our side, see Santee bleeding on the
	docks and the emergence of Eclipse. The did not travel to the islands with
	Boarak and Olam, giving battle to those who would stop us. They did not take
	up mace and invoke lightning against the Empire of MECH as it attempted to
	purify our kind into servants of their patron, Gond. How am I to lead that
	which I don&#146;t understand? I am no trail-blazer. What merry band of fools
	would follow the course I&#146;ve led? </I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>Doom awaits, and I am the herald, the Dirge of another lament, but I shall
	endeavor to turn this wrath upon the enemies of our kind. I will try and
	do as ye had, earn their respect and their support. It is with duty and my
	love for thee I do this. I know this, too, is the case with my true friend,
	Olam. Wherever ye be, know that like the Earl, we pray for thee. When an
	atheist, one of the Athar, sits in prayer, ye have surely moved he called
	souless.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>I miss thee.</I>

	<I>Does it all follow suit? No sooner than I declared the formation of House
	Winterborne, Vox discovers the presence of two who are a familiar enigma.
	</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>Trespare, a ranger that bares a strikingly similar appearance to
	zu&#146;Rianna, has appeared in the company of Erondis, my right hand in
	this place. I have nae spoken to her, but rumor has it she is Rianna incarnated.
	Is this true? I have tried to retain my cool demeanor, but my mind aches
	for an answer. Did my Queen perish, only to reborn in much the manner I was?
	Did she take this guise to travel Norrath and rejoin what few of us remain?
	How will she critique the damage I wrought with her trust?</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>And with this ray of hope or damnation, a Teir&#146;dal rogue emerges&#133;
	a name that I still am beholden to. Eclipsed, dark sister of Lokisun has
	joined the House, though we have nae spoken. What can I say to her? I have
	nae seen Lokisun since he fought me and tried to assist the Radiant in the
	domination of our kind. Instead, I have stripped our race, damned us to living
	as the vassals we once humored.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>Olam and Saidar remain servants of the Conclave, and I cannot critique
	their choice. They have been far more loyal to Rianna&#146;s vision than
	I, and yet what is the Conclave now? These waela rivven know nothing of their
	past, nae the name Rianna nor Dirge, simple lust for a hoard is all that
	remains&#133; and friendship, though nae one I share.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>I cannot tolerate such ignorance. They are so like the cattle I culled
	in the guild district of Neverwinter, it hurts me to admit the honor of this
	group I helped give birth to has fallen so low. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>I must concentrate on the immediate needs of the House, the gathering
	of power and information regarding the malfunctions plaguing our kind&#133;
	and yet these questions and memories haunt me. Ah, Vox&#133; ye must relish
	my struggle. Is it good to see thy peer diminished so, an agent at thy call,
	tormented by weak emotions of the very rivven whose form he takes? Laugh
	then. I am still the dark song, and the music shall echo in thy lair before
	I am done with Norrath.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>He faced one of the few items he&#146;d managed to bring to the land&#133;
	the portrait of zu&#146;Rianna Blisterclaw, his lost Queen.</I></TD>
