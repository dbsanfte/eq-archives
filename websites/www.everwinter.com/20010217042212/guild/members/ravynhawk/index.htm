	      <I>The Dark Wanderer sat down in the common room of the inn, one of many
	      across the continent of Antonica. He chuckled to himself, finding it amusing
	      that one outcast from the elven societies finds comfort in human surroundings,
	      if only briefly. Lighting his pipe, the wood elf arced a brow at the high
	      elf across from him, a young, idealistic elf to be sure. "Yes, youngling,
	      I am Ravynhawk Shadowfyre."</I></TD>

	<I>"The....the d-Dark Wanderer," the young elf stammered, clearly uncomfortable
	with being so close to one cast out from elven society. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Waving a hand dismissively, Ravynhawk nods slightly. "Yes, I am known
	as the Dark Wanderer, young elf, though once, once I was part of Kelethin,
	a druid serving Tunare." </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"I studied those trees, those beings under the mighty boughs of the forest.
	I learned of the faerie, the innocent fae drakes, their mighty monarchs,
	even the orcs of Crushbone itself. But, you asked me not of my studies, but
	of the reason I was cast out, didn't you," the Dark Wanderer puffs on his
	pipe thoughtfully for a moment, almost hesitant to continue. "The reason,
	quite honestly, is because I helped a dark elven woman, youngling," Ravynhawk
	stated casually, pausing for a moment for the young high elf to compose himself.
	"I found a young dark elf, barely into adulthood, trying to fend off a orcish
	war party. Without thought, I rushed in, calling upon the power of the storms
	above, sending lightning into the orcs, saving the woman." </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Sending a smoke ring above the head of the high elf, Ravynhawk's eyes
	seem to flash for a moment. "A patrol of guards from Felwithe came upon us,
	both of us exhausted. They took us both to their capital, though I know not
	of what became the young lady. I, though, was tried before the guild of noble
	paladins, found guilty of treason of the combined elven peoples of Faydwer,
	and was thus declared an outcast, a dark druid - a dark wanderer." </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"You ask me what my history is, young elf," the Dark Wanderer Ravynhawk
	Shadowfyre asked wryly, almost amused. "I did only what I thought was right,
	knowing the penalty, and accepted it. They thought to break me by declaring
	me an outcast, but I have embraced their title, Dark Wanderer." Ravynhawk
	stands, tamping his pipe out before replacing it in a pouch hanging from
	his belt. "I am indeed the Dark Wanderer, traveling the lands of Norrath,
	seeking both knowledge and power. Be warned, elfling, that one day, I shall
	return to my homeland from my travels, and the Dark Wanderer shall have justice."
	</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Ravynhawk Shadowfyre, the Dark Wanderer, raises his arms above him, calling
	upon the powers of Tunare, summoning a mystic gate, teleporting himself from
	the inn and continuing his travels. </I>
