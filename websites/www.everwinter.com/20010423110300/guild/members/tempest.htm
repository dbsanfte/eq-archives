	<I><B>History:</B> Clan Tempest, though named for a group of heroic dragons
	of the Bronze Cliffs, is an amalgamation of several similar outlooks, and
	the heroics of several individuals. Among these are the valiant human warrior
	Verro, who shed his blood for what became the House in Neverwinter and Sosaria,
	as well as the canny tactician and organizer White Leopard, who tutored our
	Queen Rianna, now known as Trespare, back in Neverwinter. &nbsp;While the
	legend Olam must split his time between commitments to the House and the
	Conclave, Aspect N'Viathon--a powerful high elven wizard--leads the Clan.</I>

	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I><B>Dogma:</B> Dogma: Ah, of course you're drawn to Clan Tempest! When
	given the choice, who else would you join? That's rhetorical! Just look at
	all we've done, the wars we've won, and the beauty we've wrought. It's no
	wonder you envy us. What a lucky person you are, to be sitting there, listening
	to me! </I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>What can I tell you of our Clan that is not blatantly obvious to those
	with eyes? We love beauty, both in form and function. Our cousins in Justice
	often shine in a field of bloodshed, but on the lapping waves of the sea,
	when peace reigns, they are like statues.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>We relish the resplendent nature around us. And, when time permits, we
	love the sea best. We know the songs of the whales and dolphins; they sing
	to us of things they see and treasures they have found. They are able to
	report on the activities of pirates, the hyenas and jackals of the trade
	currents, whom we stop whenever they cross us. Preying upon the weak or ganging
	up on the strong is typical of these bottom feeders. If killing is the only
	way to stop them from preying upon the innocent, then so be it. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>Ah, the ocean. Water is beautiful, in all it's forms, salt, fresh, and
	mist. Even the storms show the beauty of the water in the crashing of thunder
	and roaring of waves. There is purpose and power in that, and balance, for
	the tides come and go in regular cycles, the rivers swell and freeze and
	ebb with the seasons, and the calm of a lake surface brings peace and
	contemplation. Still, we are often called past the shores. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>When we travel the land, we do so in harmony with nature. The forests
	are green seas to us. While we have few true druids among us, we are warriors
	who appreciate the outside world. Yes, we are warriors, almost all of us&#133;
	though we fight with flair and stealth, when need be. The magnificence of
	a muscled and graceful body is a virtue among us. Our senses, acute from
	the time spent observing that around us, make us fine trackers, hunters,
	and archers. There is a time for arrow, but also a time for axe and sword,
	too, or perhaps a spell of obvious power and elemental mastery&#133; we are
	accustomed to battle.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>We of Clan Tempest prefer to think of ourselves as friendly. We find it
	amusing to watch others, perhaps even joining in their adventures-fighting
	for the right side is not only helpful to your friends but promotes peace
	and quiet! Perhaps you think our way placid, dull. Not true! We are the storms
	of the House. Our temper erupts from time to time. Despoilers earn most of
	our wrath-vandals, pirates, thieves, and worse. How could they possibly compete
	with us? </I>

	    <I>Betrayal is base. Give your word and stick to it, but don't be stupid

	  <LI>
	    <P ALIGN=Left>
	    <I>Lying? Well, exaggeration is perfectly fine. Beauty is rarely clear to
	    those outside the Clan.</I>
	  <LI>
	    <P ALIGN=Left>
	    <I>Bend or break the laws if necessary. Laws should promote happiness and

	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    <P ALIGN=Left>
	    <I>Maintain a stature when in the company of others.</I> &nbsp;<I>You are
	    not expected to get along with all the people, all the time.</I> &nbsp;<I>If
	    you strongly feel you are in the right, rather than going public, try to
	    resolve it within /tells with the party in question, if this becomes apparently
	    not an option, please do not hesitate in contacting a Guide to mediate in
	    a private environment.</I> &nbsp;<I>NEVER lose your composure in public as
	    this reflects poorly upon House Winterborne and the Clans within it.</I>
	  <LI>
	    <P ALIGN=Left>
	    <I>Always make every effort to adapt to your group, and not only make your
	    experience enjoyable for yourself, but for those around you as well.</I>
	  <LI>
	    <P ALIGN=Left>
	    <I>Kill Stealing is strictly forbidden. &nbsp;Never intentionally take a
	    creature or mob that another is camping or fighting.</I> &nbsp;<I>If an
	    occurrence does take place that was unintentional, do everything in power
	    to rectify the situation and demonstrate that House Winterborne and Clan
	    Tempest does not practice in this type of play. Some examples of rectification
	    are, but not limited to: &nbsp;Let the other player loot the mob in
	    question</I> <I>OR if possible, utilizing magic, increase that players stats,
	    or advantages within the game (otherwise known as buffing).</I>
	  <LI>
	    <P ALIGN=Left>
	    <I>Vulgar or offensive language will not be tolerated (either in groupsay,
	    shout, ooc, guild, or otherwise). &nbsp;Vulgar and offensive language only
	    demonstrates a lack of maturity and posture within a RPG game. &nbsp;This
	    is also a violation of the Sony/Verant policy for playing as well.</I>

		<I>2. Banded armor and a fine steel weapon, enchanter-bought jewelry, these
