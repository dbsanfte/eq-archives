<I>They met at the entrance, the large and small warriors, the green ranger,
and the pale wizard. With swords, spells, and claws, the four prepared to
deal heavy damage to the undead and their animators in the lost elven city
of Befallen.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>It was not long before numerous bones had been cracked, ghoulish fleshed
had been ripped to shreads, and necromancers had been left writhing in agony
on the chilling stones. Many fine items had been found as well, and Balkin
managed to collect a bundle of bone chips for Shivre. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>All was going well, there was little threat to the health of the small
group. Suddenly, however, there was an slight decrease in temperature, barely
noticable in the place where death walked. Balkin, Trespare, and Krudd had
left the open cavern to do battle, and so escaped the spell cast by an unseen
warlock.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Paralysis took over Keldore's senses and a deep chill set on his bones.
He was held in place, unable to move, unable to speak. For nearly ten minutes
he was nothing more the a statue. The others could not fathom his location,
the spell was coupled with invisibility. This was powerful magic at work.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Fortuately, someone or something broke the warlock's concentration and
Keldore was realized, shivering with fury and chill. He decided he had better
leave the dungeon and get some rest, departing from the others, who were
more than capable of handling themselves.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>((everything was going great, if not a bit slow. We really had no risk
in there, and spent most of the time just running back and forth. then i
locked up about 5 minutes before I was leaving anyway, so, no biggie.))</I>
