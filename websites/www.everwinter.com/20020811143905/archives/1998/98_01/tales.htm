<P>
<I>I nay profess to know as much about our history as dirge. After all he
was there. I wasn't. Yet as thou art about to discover I am nearly as old.
I have relatives as old as he, or older. I allow for some personal observation,
opinion, and belief in the tales they have related to me. None the less this
my tale as witnessed by me and related by those who came before me.</I>
<P>
<I>In the beginning were five, five and chaos, five and chaos and nothing
more. From this arose all we know, all this is, all that will be. Of the
five little is known. In fact until what humans call the Time of Troubles
none knew of their existence. None save dragon kind that is. AO hinted at
his supremacy over the so-called human gods by facilitation the end of their
god-war. Was IO's supremacy ever questioned? The question should be "When
wasn't it?" How did we get to this point? To answer that we must look from
whence we came. dirge has given us a great breakdown of the events prior.
This is my story. What is thine?</I>
<P>
<I>A funny thing about chaos.... most seek to give it order. Sure, some claim
to be chaotic but what is their true motive? What wouldst they do if they
accomplished their goal? Reveille in their victory? No, they would set about
putting order to what they had created in hopes of ruling over it. Any order
they created would be far stricter than what we tolerate now due to their
paranoia that another might take power from them.</I>
<P>
<I>While the others contemplated one acted. IO nay spent centuries studying
the chaos. He readily saw it for what it was, without purpose, without pattern,
without meaning. There was nothing to study, only organize. IO gave pattern,
meaning, and reason to part of the chaos. As each pattern emerged it drew
more of the chaos into itself until those known as our ancestors came into
being. One of each calera or in some cases one of several calera. Among these
was likely dirge and certainly my own parents. Some set out creating others
of their own likeness from the chaos. Some chose to call themselves gods.
But I ask thee this, if my parents nay claimed such, if dirge adamantly denies
it now, why should we believe the claims of these others?</I>
<P>
<I>I have yet to learn the true name of my father. For countless centuries
I thought him but a bonded kindred of IO. I doubt I shall ever know his name
as he created so few to form a calera that seems but extinct now. I have
seen but one other Mithril in my many years of wandering, a young lass named
Glimmer who was, like myself, an orphan. Her parents had been murdered on
Toril by fire giants and she too perished in Clan Barrister's attempt to
reclaim our ancestral home. Why did our parents not reemerge from the source?
Why did they chose to remain part of the chaos? I believe it was a desire
for a closer bond that they did not. Perhaps, even in chaos, they maintained
enough control that they could gather themselves together so that their
reorganization would lend to the creation of a single being. I am sure this
is the case of my parents as both were of the First Borne.</I>
<P>
<I>My mother initially emerged as a first borne similar to Tiamut. A multi-headed
creation of the metallic clans whose name I nay know. I do know they chose
to separate each to her own body spawning the original mothers of the lesser
metallic clans Gold, Silver, Brass, Bronze, Copper, and Electrum. It seems
the number of their decedents parallels the amount of the raw material found
of each type throughout the planes, hence Platinum, Mithril, and Adamantitium
First Borne emerged perhaps as separate entities or maybe Bahamut, my father,
and the Adamantitium First Borne separate as the other metallic did? I have
never found evidence of the existence of an Adamantium First Borne or any
decedents yet I believe in her existence as much as in my own.</I>
<P>
<I>My mother, Silveria, created but one in her image. The grand lady Belatrix
whom I call aunt. Such was my mother's way. She was praised for the perfection
of her creations making one and moving on to another. Many of her designs
are legendary artifacts of great renown. So perfect was her creation Belatrix
that Aunty Bell has all the powers of an original First Borne and is considered
the mother of the silver clans for it was she that created my cousins.</I>
<P>
<I>From all accounts I have found throughout the centuries, and according
to Aunty Bell, I am the first dragon to be conceived rather than created.
In fact, other than the children of dirge I find no evidence of any conceived
of First Borne. It came to pass that conception was the only means by which
creations could reproduce, again with the exception of Belatrix, so apparently
my parents were ahead of their time. :)</I>
<P>
<I>dirge mentions in the history the arrival of Greatwyrm on Toril and his
formation of a Council of Wyrms there. This was nay the first arrival of
our kind there. Toril was a favored retreat of what few Mithril my father
created and I myself was there long before Greatwyrm. In fact, I witnessed
the arrival of the hatchling there myself. I was standing in the square of
Neverwinter conversing with a group of humans who called themselves "The
Jedi" when he arrived. I often hunted with these men whom Greatwyrm fell
in with quickly becoming a full member of their organization. After much
help from myself and these Jedi Greatwyrm reached his potential in Neverwinter
and left the group to form the council. I always considered him a mouthy
runt, despite my wife's admiration of his efforts concerning the formation
of the council. I credit him with but one accomplishment; he recruited Melody
with whom I fell in love with at first glance. Were it nay for her spirit
and our intriguing courtship the idea of a Council of Wyrms on Toril would
have died due to lack of interest and discouragement over the harassment
from ITB and MECH. So firm was her resolve in seeing this thing through that
not even Greatwyrm's reappearance as an avatar of one of the First Borne
could destroy the guild.</I>
<P>
<I>Though dirge and I share similar views of the Jedi I can credit them with
one thing. They were enlightened for humans. This "force" in which they believed
led me to investigate and come to know of "The Source". With this knowledge
I was able to reveal Greatwyrm as an imposter of IO and in fact come to do
something most of us shall never do; meet IO himself.</I>
<P>
<I>So where was I during the great and glorious happenings and struggles
related by dirge in our history? Among humans I fear. As I said I was an
orphan but worse still an orphan unaware of his entire heritage. Even Aunty
Bell knew not of my father's true nature. She was unsure even if he was an
elven or human consort of my mother's human seeming. Throughout my childhood
I studied my Silver cousins and attempted to take my draconian form without
success. Finally I entered into human paladinhood in service of an ungrateful
knight who took credit for this squires accomplishments. Despite the fact
that I had won every swordsmanship tournament over the past twelve years
within leagues no one could believe I alone survived when my arrogant patron
chose to single handedly rush an encamp of orcs in worship of Grimash. And
I knew better than to reveal that the Orc First Borne himself had been in
attendance. So I became Johan Graye, wandering paladin. I had taken the name
Graye as I considered it a tarnished silver and I was unable to achieve my
true Silver form.<BR>
I knew I had powers unlike any human I had ever met but attributed most of
it to the sword I wielded. An artifact of tremendous power, constructed for
the protection of a son she would never know, this was easy for me to do.
But as I began to study magic I began to wonder how much was the sword and
how much my own abilities to manipulate the energies around me. I wondered
the planes in service of Athena as was so successful at foiling the plots
of her brother Aries that he sought vengeance upon her directly. I am still
unsure of the means he used, or the aid he received, but he was able to
incapacitate the patron of wisdom. I was quite alarmed to receive the summons
to Olympus and even more surprised to find Aries torturing Athena. But even
this was nay as shocking as my victory over the patron of war! The scars
I bear upon each shoulder are a result of Athena personally knighting me.
Even the wounds I received from Aries healed without a trace.</I>
<P>
<I>Some years later I came to Faerun and learned it had been the place of
my birth. Athena was concerned with the growing power of a group there known
as the Zhentarim. They controlled, and still do, three stronghold in the
heartlands and Mystra had asked Athena to send what aid she could. I still
have yet to figure out the connection there but it was nay mine to question.
A local duke had had his daughter kidnaped near a small town known as Daggerford.
I suspected him of being a member of the Zhentarim black network and that
the kidnaping was merely a ruse to steal the tax monies of his own people
for their dark end and rescued the lass. The grateful? duke offered me a
boon. I think the lad expected me to ask for the daughter's hand. He was
nearly grief stricken when Instead I asked for the Misty Forest. He held
unrightful claim to the forest calling it "Daggerford Wood". Not only did
it belong to the elven people it was the burial place of my parents. I excepted
the Earldom and built a fortress on the eastern edge upon the land bridge
crossing Treachery Gorge. Treachery Gorge had been created when my mother's
scream of pain at my father's death ripped open the heart of Abeirtoril.
The land bridge was centered by a large area upon which she had been standing.
This was the site of their burial as well.</I>
<P>
<I>Castle Graye protected Misty Forest from invaders off the High Moors and
became my own stronghold in thwarting the schemes of the Zhentarim. The land
bridge was the only access to the heart of the forest for 100 miles in either
direction due to the gorge. Yet I left rule of the forest to the elves to
whom it rightfully belonged holding the title of Earl only to keep the Zhentarim
and other human rulers eager for land and power at bay. As my influence grew,
particulary and surprisingly to the north, I helped reform a company known
as the Border Legion. Their aim was the protection of Neverwinter in service
of Lord Nasher. Though the group had great success against the raiders of
Luskan to the north my presence to the southeast was seen as vital in keeping
the Zhentarim from joining in the effort to pull Neverwinter from Lord Nasher's
grasp. The merchants of Neverwinter played a vital part in my own plans so
the group benefitted my aims as well. When I established a residence in the
area I soon became known as the richest man in Neverwinter. Whether or not
this was true I know not. Perhaps it was my endless generosity that led to
the moniker.</I>

<P>
<I>It was after I married Melody and the birth of our daughter Rose that
I finally learned the rest of my heritage. We were spending more of our time
at Castle Graye and I was frequenting Candlekeep doing research when near
disaster struck. I was away assisting a group of old friends known as OGS
when the hoards from the High Moors attacked the castle. Frustrated by years
of being kept out of Misty Forest and led by an agent of the Zhentarim they
not only amassed at the eastern end of the land bridge but had coordinated
their attack with forces which had circled the gorge from either end. The
fortress guards were well versed in attacks from the east and were handling
the situation brilliantly but we were less prepared for assault from the
forest itself. Perhaps it was only the joint effort but the forest side of
the stronghold was meant to be more inviting and appealing to visitors.</I>
<P>
<I>Melody and I wear matching pendants around our necks. The jewels are made
of large rubies and cut into heart shapes. They had been a wedding gift of
a long departed friend and comrade in the Border Legion. Thou his magic wasn't
on the order of allowing communication they could communicate a warning that
the other was in danger. Even as the pendant began burning it's warning against
my chest, Melody was summoning aid from the Council Aerie. Being within a
wild magic area I had several days hard riding just to reach a spot from
which I could teleport home. The borders of such areas were as yet ill defined
and although I was anxious to get home I wished to get there in one piece.
Castle Graye had often served as a refuge to the Council leaders Reklaive,
and now Rianna, for the past few years. I only hoped they would offer her
the defense she had them. Melody was still recovering from a very trying
childbirth. A healthy red dragon might make short work of an invasion from
the moors but I had been hearing rumors of Zhentarim agents, beholders among
them, working with the usually disorganized bands of giants, trolls, ettin,
ogre, orc, and hobgoblin. You can imagine my relief when I was to finally
able to communicate with Melody and learn the Council was fully engaged in
protecting the western access and the forest. Like most organizations human
the Border Legion had lived its course and past, yet again, into history.
The family Graye's other allies were involved in struggles of their own.
Thank IO for the Council of Wyrms.</I>
<P>
<I>When the Lady related that the elven warriors of Misty Forest had been
lured into the stronghold to defend the eastern escarpment I knew the beholders
and Zhentarim were involved. Somehow the forces that had came around the
gorge had to have been hidden. There was simply no way they could have gone
undetected by the elves and stormed the western preface otherwise. This threat
had to be eliminated. Taking out the command and control of my enemy was
paramount. I dared not draw from the Council presence. Number one I knew
not the exact strength of the forces they faced and number two I had fought
holders with most of them. The metallic in particular held a deep dread of
the creatures at that point. True, I often traveled the sewers linking
Neverwinter and Triboar alone without fear. I could easily handle the golems
and beholders single-handed but my reconnaissance was excellent. I could
plan and strategize before hand. But this was an unknown situation against
an unknown foe of unknown strength. I needed information, I needed a tactical
approach. And above all I needed some assistance. I knew of but one I could
turn to for all three.</I>
<P>
<I>I had heard of a dwarf named Valator. I nay knew him directly but I had
an advantage. His mount, Frank, was one of my cousins. Surely if Aunty Bell
were to mediate I could count on their aid. Besides, rumor had it this lad
was always eager for a fight and the slimmer the odds the better. It was
also said he often island hopped and could actually defeat the holders there
without having someone play "sacrificial lamb", a strategy used by most to
overcome that battle. But I needed Val for more than his battle prowess and
tactical ability. Neither of us could form a plan without information. Mounted
on an aerial steed Valator could locate, gauge strength, and formulate the
beginnings of a plan even before he met me.</I>
<P>
<I>The three of us met behind a rim of hills in the moors as close as we
dared to the battlefield. Going over his tentative plan we decided a split
offensive with Frank both flying CAP and making detracting strafing runs
would be our best approach. "Here'd tell ye took less damage then 'neone
while win'n at that millie turnment at Winnerfeast? Ever solo the wuds dracs
an' win?", asked the dwarf. "Once," I replied. "Hmph, outta how many tries?
Don't madder dis is werse. Lots werse! Good thang ya's got me and Frank 'ere
ain't it?" I'd gotten use to a certain formality upon meeting others for
the first time. Even among the dwarves. In fact I half expected it due to
the reputation I had established both in the area of Neverwinter and Faerun
itself. Apparently this wasn't to be a problem with Val and due to the
desperation of the situation I was relieved.</I>
<P>
<I>I will nay banter on about how the three of us annihilated the giants,
mages, and beholders Val and Frank had located. It would nay be true for
one thing. What we were able to accomplish was to slay a few, cripple a few
more, but most importantly disrupt the organizing force behind Castle Graye's
assailants. My last victory against the Zhentarim, and it came at a price.
Frank was grievously wounded and Val was taking it hard. "Look ya' gots thangs
ta do. Leave us be an get to 'um."</I>
<P>
<I>Val was right. Frank was too far gone. Had I the aid of the Council or
my resources at Castle Graye I might save him. But one was tied up defending
the other. "Oh I near fergot", the dwarf interrrupted my thoughts, "that
aunt of yers, tha talkin pegasus, she said she had fetched that stuff ya'd
been lookin fer from Candlekeep. Seems yer fadder was a Mithril Dragun. Who
ever hered of such a thang?"</I>
<P>
<I>Apparently Belatrix had nay revealed her true nature to the dwarf. Yet
Frank had recognized her as the First Borne mother, and creator, of the silver
clans. Val had obviously gone on Franks's word that this mission was one
they should have taken. But more importantly the Star Rider had just saved
his mount. I would have liked to have seen the look on his face when the
Grand Lady of Silver arrived to save the life of one of her own upon my summons.
But like he had said I had things to do and could only assure him it would
be alright.</I>
<P>
<I>The battle that ensued at Castle Graye is a matter of historical record.
We fared far better there. A new member of the Council, one Olan Cz, fought
shoulder to shoulder with Rianna and Limitor. They handled the brunt of the
assault and took a beating for it. Even Bloodeyes fought valiantly and despite
his suggestion at ulterior motives I suspect it was his love little Rose
Graye that compelled him to act. But the turning point came as I arrived
to see Melody falling to the ground from a dangerous height. I hadn't given
much thought to what Valator had told me of my father. The mention of Bel
had only intensified my concern for Frank. Yet this knowledge must have been
in the back of my mind. I think for the first time in my long life I was
enraged. Always the careful planner, the tactician who gave forethought to
his every action, I never rushed into anything. But the rage, the fear, and
the concern at seeing my beloved in such peril was more than I could bear.
I reacted to the feelings inside me on instinct and gave into them. I could
feel myself entering the weave and emerged as the first Mithril dragon of
the Council, a being of such power and unexpectedness that the hoard pitted
against us fled in dismay. Yes after many months of coaxing on the parts
of my adopted father-in-law ReKlaive and Rianna I officially became a member
of the Council of Wyrms. Most believe me to be one of the original members
but until this point I had been only an integral player not associated with
the guild except in the capacity as Ambassador from another guild, suitor
and later husband of the Red High Lord. For months I had been considering
the move but I had sworn allegiance to the Border Legion. I nay give my word
and break it. Only after the legion disbanded did I feel free to make other
commitments. I had been considering creating a band of Paladins sworn to
follow a more precise code than what I had seen in Neverwinter. But the way
the Council came through for me and my family in our darkest hour led me
home.</I>
<P>
<I>Some ask "why the Gold clan? Thine own cousins are Silver". To them I
refer to the acceptance of ReKlaive who long suspected my true heritage and
referred to me as "Dragonheart" and the near constant companionship and counsel
of Limitor, both of the gold. To ReKlaive's adoption of Melody as his own
daughter which also answers the question of why a metallic would marry a
chromatic. Melody was nay born of our creed. She was born human and sacrificed
to a Red that terrorized the small village in which she grew up. Instead
of devouring her he chose to make her his daughter and, perhaps one of the
First Born, managed to recreated her as such. She learned the ability to
shape change in order to return to her old self but all she had known had
ceased to exist. Only after joining the Council did she learn of her brother
Meenman's long life. Twas he whom introduced us and set my feet upon my own
fated path.</I>
<P>
<I>Within the next few years dirge rose to lead the Council. He foresaw the
end of our stay upon Toril as did I. Matters with the Zhentarim had only
grown worse. With the Legion gone and the growing number of guilds aligned
against those supporting him, Lord Nasher's reign over Neverwinter seemed
to be near an end. The guild of thieves known as Spirit Lurkers robbed the
good merchants and adventurer blind. Even Neverwinter's vaults were nay safe
against them. Dark times lay ahead. The Council became the Coterie of Wings
and left Neverwinter. In search of a new home myself I joined in the fight
to regain our ancestral home and upon it being secured used an ancient scroll
to teleport Castle Graye and the secreted catacombs beneath to this new home
of the Gold Clan Barrister.</I>
