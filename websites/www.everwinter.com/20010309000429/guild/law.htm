	well.</B></I></FONT>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>All guild members are required to enact their characters in an in-character,
	role-playing fashion when speaking aloud (/say) or on the guild channel.
	Out-of-character comments must be designated as OOC, either through
	&#147;OOC:&#148; or double parenthesis surrounding the comment.
	&nbsp;Roleplaying is central to House Winterborne. We are willing to teach
	those with an interest, but we seek skilled role-players as recruits.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><I><B>II. &nbsp;Thou shalt nae create discord among
	thy fellows.</B></I></FONT>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>All guild members are expected to behave in a mature fashion. The EverQuest
	terms-of-service will be strictly enforced. No harrassment, profanity, or
	vulgarity will be tolerated. No hacking will be accepted. Dynamic role-playing
	is acceptable, but consider the interests and welfare of your guild-mates.
	Arguments are good sources of character development, but petty bickering
	adds nothing positive to the gaming experience.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I><B>III. &nbsp;Thou shalt attend to the House regularly.</B></I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>House Winterborne has a few activity requirements, stressing both role-playing
	on the message board and in-game outing/event participation.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<B><I>--Posting Policy--</I></B><BR>
	&nbsp; 
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    <P ALIGN=Left>
	    <I><B>Weekly Journal ~ </B>Each primary character should be required to post
	    a short journal of their week's adventures <B>IF</B> they aren't involved
	    in a bigger event that week (see below).</I>
	  <LI>
	    <P ALIGN=Left>
	    <I><B>Guild Outings ~ </B>Any guild hunting of three or more guild members
	    should have a designated "scribe" that writes up a journal. &nbsp;For example,
	    Amorsaylnn, Sharhel, and Willmina were hunting EK yesterday. &nbsp;Shar might
	    voluneteer to write the journal. &nbsp;If no volunteers step forward, the
	    low number on a random roll will scribe.</I>
	  <LI>
	    <P ALIGN=Left>
	    <I><B>Guild Events ~ </B>Any guild event (Runnyeye, Solusek A, etc.) should
	    have a designated scribe, as above.</I>
	  <LI>
	    <P ALIGN=Left>
	    <I><B>Ongoing Story-Lines ~ </B>Any week in which a character is involved
	    in outing or event <B>OR</B> an ongoing story-line evolving on the message
	    boards makes them exempt from a required journal, whether or not they are
	    the designated scribe.</I>
	</UL>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><I><B>IV. &nbsp;Thou shalt reply the wishes of House
	officers promptly and to the best of thy abilities.</B></I></FONT>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Electronic mail from guild officers (indicated on the roster) should be
	answered promptly and with as much detail as needed. Administration functions
	should be secondary to the role-playing; officers who donate their time to
	these tasks should be treated with respect. If a player is going on a leave
	of absence of more than one week, we request notification.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><I><B>V. &nbsp;Thou shalt nae steal the victory of
	another warrior. Should an accident befall thee, have the dignity t&#146;
	make amends.</B></I></FONT>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>House Winterborne tolerates no kill stealing. We define kill-stealing
	as follows: Taking a kill that somebody has already engaged or taking a spawn
	that somebody has been camping. If accidental kill-stealing occurs, we recommend
	you compensate by a buff spell or allowing the other character to loot. If
	you are a victim of kill-stealing, we have trust in a member&#146;s ability
	to gauge whether engaging in kill-stealing in compensation is acceptable.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><I><B>VI. &nbsp;Thou shalt be permitted inheritance
	and assistance from the wealth of t&#146; House.</B></I></FONT>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>House Winterborne allows what is commonly referred to as
	&#147;twinking&#148;, giving items to other characters that are beyond their
	means. We prefer these cases of gifting aren&#146;t exorbitant. In other
	words, banded armor and a fine steel weapon, enchanter-bought jewelry, these
	are acceptable, with perhaps an item of real-value or two. On the other hand,
	full totemic for a first level shaman is excessive. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<B><I>VII. &nbsp;</I></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><I><B>Treasure ye gain shall
	be offered first t&#146; the benefit of thy House mates.</B></I></FONT>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>When items are found, before auctioning them through the general channels,
	make certain the guild members have a five (5) day period to purchase them
	for a fair price. For example, a savant&#146;s cap might fetch 25 PP to 40
	PP on the open market, depending on auction location. &nbsp;Offering this
	item to another guild member for 25 PP would be acceptable. Gifts are always
	welcome, but we understand characters earn their &#147;living&#148; on their
	finds.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<B><I>VIII. &nbsp;</I></B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B><I>Combat with other
	power-groups is permitted, as well as duels and Arena
	battles.</I></B></FONT>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>PvP+ characters are welcome and dueling is acceptable. Since the PvP system
	of EverQuest entails consent, duels between guild members are also acceptable,
	providing both are in agreement.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><I><B>NOTE:</B></I></FONT>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Our guild is not &#147;aligned&#148; and not exclusive. This means characters
	of all moral and ethical stances can be found within the group. Likewise,
	players are free to have other characters in other guilds. Our guild exists
	to add to EverQuest gaming experience, providing a dynamic story-line for
	role-playing, as well as traditional guild benefits. Maturity among our members
	is expected and exceptions are quickly dealt with.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><I><B>Alternate/Secondary Characters:</B></I></FONT>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Once a player is accepted into House Winterborne, they may add up to two
	alternate characters to the roster provided they have submitted a seperate
	character history and said character has reached the 10th level of experience.
	Exceptions to this rule may be granted by guild officers.</I>
