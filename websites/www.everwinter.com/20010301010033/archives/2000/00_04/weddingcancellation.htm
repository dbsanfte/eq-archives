<I>Flutrose drummed her fingers on the table as she considered the message
she was about to write. The candle flickered very slightly now and again
as she would reach out and sip of her honey mead, then set it aside and once
again stare at the blank piece of parchment before her.<BR>
<BR>
She sighed and muttered an oath to herself at the perfidy of men. Placing
quill to scroll, she hastily scribbled a message, sprinkled sand upon the
ink to rapidly dry it, and then tinkled the bell which summoned a
page.<BR>
<BR>
"Boy, do ye know the location of the guildhouse of House Winterborne? Tis
verra far from here." The lad eagerly bobbed his head up and down. "Good.
Take this scroll, and deliver it unto the House Scribe ye shall find there.
Tell him that Lady Flutrose wishes this message sent to all people of the
House. This money is for thy efforts. Ye will receive the same amount again
once I am told ye have completed delivery." She handed the boy five platinum
pieces, and summoned food and drink for him that he not have an excuse to
tarry along the way.<BR>
<BR>
One day later......<BR>
<BR>
The halfling bobbed from side to side, grinning at the Scribe. "You be da
scribe fer Winterborne?" The scribe looked up impatiently from his sheaf
of papers. "Aye lad, that I am. What business hae ye with me? Make it quick,
I am a busy man."<BR>
<BR>
The halfling cleared his throat and grinned to himself. He handed the Scribe
a rather tattered scroll, and began to speak. "The Lady Flutrose wants ya
to send this to all da peoples in Winterborne. She also wants ya ta give
me ten plat, and she will pay ya back later." The scribe reached for a purse
and handed the halfing ten platinum. Dismissing the boy, he broke the seal
on the missive and began to read....<BR>
<BR>
"I have been asked by Lady Trespare to inform all that, due to unforeseen
circumstances, her proposed marriage to Lord Amabala has been
cancelled."<BR>
<BR>
The scribe then began hiring the necessary couriers and transcribing the
message into the Records. His opinion of the message mattered not; he had
a job to do.</I>
