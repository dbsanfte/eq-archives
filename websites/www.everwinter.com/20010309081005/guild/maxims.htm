	<I> EverQuest doesn&#146;t provide a great deal of structure for some serious
	role-playing issues. The guild has agreed to some ideas to provide a bit
	of continuity and depth to our role-playing. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I><IMG SRC="bar.gif" WIDTH="510" HEIGHT="19" BORDER="0" ALIGN="Middle"></I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I><B>Maxim</B>: A character&#146;s true class, and even gender or race,
	may differ greatly from the game mechanics. A human might be "part" Iksar
	and exhibit traits such as claws, hissing, and the like. A druid might consider
	himself a conjurer, or even a ranger. Accept the role-playing and ignore
	the game mechanics. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I><B>Maxim</B>: A character&#146;s religion&#151;if any&#151;does not
	necessarily reflect their class and race. For example, a dark elf cleric
	or necromancer is confined to worshipping Innoruuk within the game, but the
	player may choose another power, or none at all, entirely. As a guild, we
	do not assume religion based on game mechanics. A dark elf cleric *could*
	be a priestess of Tunare, for our RP purposes.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I><B>Maxim</B>: A character&#146;s level doesn&#146;t indicate their power
	or strength. Surname&#146;s indicate an acknowledgment of the citizens of
	Norrath or the character&#146;s guild. As a guild, we may role-play a fourth
	level necromancer as a powerful character (the equivalent of a 50th level
	character) or a 30th level enchanter, as a young and unworldly prodigy. This
	is left up to the player, though we encourage some realism.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I><B>Maxim</B>: Not all characters are natives of Norrath. Characters from
	other worlds may well find themselves on Norrath. Some characters within
	the guild hail from other online games, such as Neverwinter Nights, Ultima
	Online, or the Realm. Such histories are encouraged and can be worked into
	the history of Norrath; said characters are plane-travelers; they may have
	a much weaker form in Norrath, perhaps taking time (experience) to master
	magic, or the laws of the world.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I><B>Maxim</B>: Real life time limitations do not equate to a character
	being absent from Norrath. Characters can be assumed to have an existence
	beyond the time their player enacts them. If the player is absent for three
	weeks, perhaps the character has been at work learning a language, a trade
	skill, visiting a relative, spying on an enemy, or even on another plane.
	Character absence, particularly when a player has an extended leave, *can*
	be explained by the player, but it isn&#146;t required.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I><B>Maxim</B>: A character does not die when they loose a battle. Instead,
	we assume that a character that falls in battle is saved at the last moment
	by a "death pact" with Lady Vox; this Winterborne character is teleported
	away to a safe spot, sans equipment. Other characters outside of the guild
	might be saved by the magic of their guilds, their own contingencies, or
	their guardian power (god or goddess). A cleric resurrection spell allows
	character&#146;s to be brought back to life, however, if the player of the
	deceased character so desires; otherwise, they are simply drawn from their
	bind spot.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I><B>Maxim</B>: House Winterborne is a "noble" house of Norrath, specifically
	the city of Qeynos, on the western shore of Antonica. We role-play that the
	House has a guild hall within the walls of North Qeynos even though the game
	mechanics don&#146;t permit player/guild-owned property.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Other Maxims will be added to this list if they are needed to further
	our pursuit of role-playing.</I>
