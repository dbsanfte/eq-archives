<I>Little Peony groaned softly in her sleep, one arm tossed carelessly across
her brow, the other hanging to the ground. The dream had returned to her..
</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I> She was just a novice healer when she had met Erondis, that arrogant,
foppish, young enchanter.. Something about him though had attracted her,
attracted her like even Dolgo couldn't. Maybe it was the hidden smile that
played at the corners of his mouth, or the all knowing quirk of his brow.
As time passed, and they grew stronger, so did their friendship.. it blossomed
into something that siblings can only be jealous of.. When the day came that
he formally invited her to be one of his clan.. one of the Wyrm.. her heart
swelled with joy. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I> Peony entered the Wyrm's home with much trepidation that first day, fearing
that she would not be able to live up to the standard that the group demanded.
Soon however she found her niche and grew to understand the rules that governed
them. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I> Time passed quickly, Peony grew rich in coin, and made only a few true
friends within the clan.. she was disappointed at the lack of communication
between the group.. they seemed only to rely on one another as a means to
gain more wealth for themselves.. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She found them silly, as she would gladly have given every last platinum
piece if only they would have stopped to look around and see the power that
the very land had to offer them. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I> In the end it was the friendship of Erondis and Rackin that saw her
through..she loved them both dearly and would have gladly given her lifesblood
to see them survive the battles before them. It was then that the dreams
began to haunt her.. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I> Cold, cold blinding snow, hailing down around her.. she was lost and
couldn't see her own feet as she wandered aimlessly..Her head was bent against
the wind, her shoulders hunched against the frigid air. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I> Sounds came out of the whiteness around her, driving her forever onwards..
her mind was devoid of the friendly voices that had kept her company and
given the much needed advice all these years.. After a time, even the chittering
noises vanished and she felt truly alone for the first time in ages.. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I> It was then that she would notice the red splashes across the snow and
she would begin to follow them to their source.. The trail led her to an
immense cave of ice, shrouded with a haunted light. Peony's knees would buckle
as she gazed inside, for there before her lay an immense beast, its innards
seeping into the snow around it. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I> She fell into herself and awoke with a start, the sweat beading up on
her brow.. Quickly she looked around and found herself to be in the rented
room she had found.. The sounds from the bar below were familiar enough and
slowly she relaxed.. Peony wondered what the dream meant, and why it dogged
her footsteps every night. She sighed softly and slid from the blankets..
it would be another long day if she were to reach her destination before
it was too late.. </I>
