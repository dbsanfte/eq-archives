	    <TD><I>The old man looked up into the sky, his cloudy eyes no longer able
	      to distinguish clearly the snow capped peaks of the mountains from the winter
	      blue sky. He knew that they were a sight to behold though: He had spent his
	      entire life living in these mountains and hoping, like the young man beside
	      him, that each day would be THE day. His day had not come, and with regret
	      he looked back onto his younger years.</I></TD>

	<I> "Revered Master, Sir? For what purpose do we contemplate the wind?" The
	young one was full of energy and drive, so sure that this generation was
	to be THE generation. He fretted at the stillness of the training, as many
	had before, and yearned to fulfil the purpose set onto them by the generous
	and wise Azure, now six generations gone. The old man shook his head. In
	fifty years, this youth would be at the top of the mountain, looking with
	nearly blind eyes at the only home he had known and he too would endure the
	impatient questions set to him by the next generation.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"We neither contemplate the wind, nor ignore it. It just is."</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"Why are we here then? What am I supposed to learn?" The boy tossed his
	raven dark hair away from his eyes impatiently. His eyes were a deep sapphire
	blue, as the old man&#146;s had once been, and they darted about the canyon
	walls looking for something to catch his attention. The old man sighed and
	took one last sightless gaze at the desolate peaks before turning around
	to go back into the cave. He walked with confidence though he no longer could
	see the path well at all but the confidence was tinged with a slow weary
	sadness. He often came to the ledge to ponder things gone by and was always
	loathe to leave it to the winds and return to the underground complex. The
	boy came with him, his feet awkward on the stone floor as he tried to adjust
	his pace to the crawl of the old man. A smile pulled on the withered lips,
	age hath some privilege.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"Well?" The boy was waiting for an answer to his question. There was no
	answer, the wind mattered not but the boy was too young to understand.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"Maybe tomorrow." The old man spoke quietly, perhaps to himself, his words
	holding more meaning than just the answer to the youth. He walked on, oblivious
	to the prodding of the boy until the youth ran out of patience and walked
	sullenly behind him.</I>

	<I>Mica lay awake long after the torches had been doused. Why had they gone
	to the surface? There was no point in it, it wasted his valuable training
	time. He wanted to roll over and go to sleep; tomorrow he would be learning
	advanced horsemanship but he just kept wondering at the abrupt change in
	training. Why? What purpose did it serve. Did he miss something essential?
	</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>He got up and paced back and forth in the pitch black. Even in the inky
	stillness of the cave night he knew the confines of his room. He had been
	trained to navigate without sight, relying on his other senses to tell him
	where things were. By now he could be placed anywhere within the large complex
	and find his way to anywhere else and through anyone. He had been one of
	the chosen of Azure for as far back as he could remember and had lived in
	the huge underground community surrounded by the other chosen, living and
	learning along side of them. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>There was a purpose to their existence. The Son&#146;s of Azure trained
	for the day when they might be called on to fulfil the prophecy of their
	now dead guardian. There would be a need for the chosen and until they were
	called, they trained diligently and honed their skills to perfection. The
	trip outside bothered Mica because he felt he had failed somehow, but he
	couldn&#146;t see where. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>He sat down on the edge of his bed, tired of his thoughts swimming around,
	tired of thinking through the exercise from every angle, tired of coming
	up empty. He fell back onto the mattress, imagining the ceiling as he would
	see it in the flickering torchlight. What had he missed? He couldn&#146;t
	get it out of his head. He drifted off to sleep thinking of the trip to the
	surface until a small odd thought popped into his head: Hooves were one of
	the least efficient designs for an underground animal.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Somewhere in his sleep, he dreamed of a pale skinned lady in the moonlight;
	her hair a glittering cascade and her skin the pureness of crystalline
	snow.</I>
