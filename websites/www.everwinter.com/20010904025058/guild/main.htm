  <I>Well, all our computer problems aren't behind us, but Shar and I are back
  in Norrath. &nbsp;Shar's computer still locks up at every zone, but she doesn't
  have problems other than that, so we're going to call that good and probably
  pick up a DirectX 7.0a compatible sound card in February or March. &nbsp;Our
  first hunting trip was focused on the Tesch Mal gnolls outside of Split Paw.
  &nbsp;It was a nice two-hour hunting trip and we'll hit 27th next time we
  play.</I>

  <I>Shar and I are off for the arctic circle as of tomorrow morning (okay,
  Northern Michigan). &nbsp;We'll be gone until the 27th, most likely. &nbsp;We
  received our Voodoo3 video cards yesterday. &nbsp;I'll get them installed
  after I get back and we'll be back to puttering about the Karanas. &nbsp;*Grins
  at Morphite* &nbsp;We've had quite a few suggestions for hunting nights,
  including some of the zones in Velious, Kaesora in Kunark, the Kedge Keep
  enterance and the Permafrost King room. &nbsp;I hope we get a chance to organize
  these in January and early February. &nbsp;Warm wishes and hopefully that
  named MOB "Santa" cons green but drops the "fat l3wt!" :)</I>

  <I>I've completed the archives; June through the end of October is now available
  in the Desolate Muse section. &nbsp;I also added the Black Chancery font
  to the fantasy fonts collection. &nbsp;Shar and I will be working on getting
  back into EQ when our video cards are actually shipped from Amazon's warehouses
  (ordered December 3rd... in stock, and they haven't shipped as of this morning.
  &nbsp;*Sigh*). &nbsp;I have a few ideas for ongoing story lines that I'll
  be introducing and I'll continue work on updating Fallon's favorite... the
  Starlight Tavern. &nbsp;I hope to be done that section after the holidays.

  <B><I>It's Fixed!</I></B> &nbsp;<I>As all of you have figured out from the
  message boards, my computer's been down. &nbsp;I've got my system back online,
  though I'm still waiting on some graphics software. &nbsp;I'll be working
  to catch up on the site over the next few days... updating the roster and
  archiving the message board, among other things. &nbsp;Another quick note.
  &nbsp;I'm still working on getting EQ installed on my machine; attempts at
  accessing the EQ CD lock it up (either through auto-run or explorer). &nbsp;If
  that's not a bad omen, I don't know what is! &nbsp;I'm going to copy it over
  from my home network (Shar's install). &nbsp;On a related note, Balkin and
  Shar are both having problems with the last patch for EQ... Shar's seems
  to be video card problems with DirectX 7.0a, so we'll probably be upgrading
  to a Voodoo3 card. &nbsp;More info. as I find the problems.</I>

  started on 11/20. &nbsp;The roster should be current with one or two exceptions.
  &nbsp;My system is working again, albeit *very* slowly since the DirectX
  7.0a patch. &nbsp;I'm ordering a pair of Voodoo3 cards for my system and
  Shar's system tonight. &nbsp;For those that aren't keeping up on the message
  board, Balkin's system is also down right now due to the change in video
  requirements. &nbsp;~dirge</I>

  <I>I'm proud to annouce that our Gnoll Bounty in Qeynos last night was a
  great success! &nbsp;When we finally turned in, there were many shouts of
  thanks and praise for our efforts in northern Qeynos. &nbsp;It's my hope
  some of the participants will visit our home, here, and come to know us.
  &nbsp;</I>
  <P ALIGN=Center>
  <I>It was also a great pleasure to meet our newest member, Artes, a noble
  monk of the 19th order. &nbsp;Welcome to the House and may your journey with
  us exciting. &nbsp;His profile has been added
  (<A HREF="guild/members/artes/index.htm">HERE</A>), a member of Clan Warclaw
  for his early days in the House.</I>

  <I>Congratulations to the following: &nbsp;Brombeard on 22nd, Morphite on
  31st, Trespare on 31st, and Keldore hit 26th, then lost it to the fiends
  of Dalnir. &nbsp;I'm sure it'll only be a few days before you regain your
  new circle. &nbsp;Balkin also was instrumental in assisting Shar in attaining
  her Totemic Vambraces. &nbsp;Soon after, Amorsaylnn and Shar had the fortune
  of finding Grizzleknot in South Karana, and laid low the evil treant. &nbsp;They
  recoved a Cloak of Leaves and bark used in the Totemic Breast Plate quest.

the archives, the new Starlight Tavern, and adding some computer games /
videos to the online store. &nbsp;I believe I'll begin updating the AD&amp;D
sections (still 2nd Edition) and the EQ Lore area, as time permits.</I>
