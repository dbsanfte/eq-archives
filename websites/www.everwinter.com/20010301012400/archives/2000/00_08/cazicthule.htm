<I>The lizard men had been fight back all day. Much of the air was filled
with their dull, gutteral chants. Each chant, they hoped would bring the
blessings of thier lord, and, of course, their champion, the Avatar of
Fear.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Many of the lesser lords in the temple had been winning thier battles
against the mobs that attempted to vanquish them. Though more for their hoards,
"loot" as the Rivvin called it, then for any real moral victory. Still, it
was nice to be able to reap the benefits of the hooligans every now and
then.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>This day brought forth Morphite and Balkin to do battle within the Silvered
Temple. A prescouting forray by Morphite found the silver temple burned and
in shambles. A strong party of adventurers claimed ownership of the entire
area. Morphite and Balkin discussed their options amid the shouts for others
to join the fight against the hoards, elsewhere in the temple. Finally the
pair decided upon the Archon Temple, a larger, more fortified temple past
the maze of the defenders. The temple had some large open areas and seemed
to be available.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Soon after arriving at the hunt spot the pair were again asked to join
a solid group and agreed. The hunting was fast and furious and all seemed
well. A monk went to go bring the group more and whilst drinking and talking
the group did nae see her die. A quick death, nonetheless, but a sad one.
She never returned except to reclaim her items. In the midst, Rianna did
arrive and lend a hand as well. In fact, played healer she did, till the
lovely Miss Kimber showed to lend her magiks of healing. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>It was about that time that the overhunting of the area took its toll
and soon the group hungered for more. Into the upper reaches of the temple
is where they would hunt . . . and die. </I>
