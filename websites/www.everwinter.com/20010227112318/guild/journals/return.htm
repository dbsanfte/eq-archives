<I>The dark elf smashed his staff down into the skull of the small gnoll,
bored beyond words with the experience. Claiming a life normally held a thrill
for Shiver, but the hunting of the pups near the northern walls of Qeynos
had become so routine, it was little better than the mundane tasks Fallon
toiled at. He bent down, pulling four silver coins and a sprinkling of copper
from the creatures purse, quickly pocketing it. He rose again, peering through
the mist while slipping into the shadows for concealment. And he waited.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The gnolls didn&#146;t come out at night, and it was getting darker.
Fortunately, poorly animated skeletons did venture forth from their graves
and Shiver had use for them, too. He needed the gnoll kills to establish
his reputation within the human lands. The decaying skeletons, no doubt risen
by the temple deep beneath the city, provided fragments of bone he could
use to draw forth a servant undead for his own purposes. Innoruuk&#146;s
lesson had not been lost, though he denied any association with the foul
creature. In truth, Shiver despised the undead&#133; dirty, mindless things
possessed only by the will of their creator and a hatred of life. However,
they were apt vassals in a land where loyalty was hard to find, and even
more difficult to assure.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The last few weeks tore at his thoughts. Erondis was recovering bits of
his sanity, but he was not the sage Shiver would have preferred. Aulura was
quite the slut, but an effective assassin and bait, should he need such an
agent. He didn&#146;t completely trust her, though it would have been logical
to join forces; Vox pulled both their strings. In all his years, he was still
amazed by the folly the younger races&#151;even the First Borne&#151;wrought.
It wasn&#146;t precisely surprise, but rather an incredible disappointment.
The potential, all squandered&#133; squandered like the Conclave and House
Winterborne was teetering on the scales of judgment.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Like it or not, Shiver had long decided he was not a visionary, nor a
leader of such groups. He understood some of the goals and ideals held by
the guilds, noble houses, and clans of Norrath, though their objectives did
not align with his own. He desperately missed the freedom he had once felt
during his "alliance" with the exiled Council of Wyrms in Neverwinter. There
he was an enforcer, admired and feared for his battle prowess, as well as
his political savvy. It was a game, albeit one played with lives, but
weren&#146;t those the greatest of stakes? The higher the stakes, the more
exiting the sport, or so he had felt.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>But the ante continued to increase and his friends suffered. Valator had
fallen to Crinshinabaum and his plans, then the Earl disappeared shortly
thereafter. He felt some blame for their fates, though he had never found
proof of their death. He suspected Johan had simply chosen another life,
far from the Isles; Shiver envied him that luxury. Even the result of the
Orb Winter and the Radiant&#146;s ploy&#133; the loss of their true
forms&#151;there were worse fates, and some would consider it a victory despite
the cost.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Shiver slumped against the wall, his gossamer brilliant in the darkness,
but still lost among the mist and shadow.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Sister, do ye seek to return t&#146; the world of the living?" His voice
was low and pained. He didn&#146;t expect an answer beyond the wave of guilt
and longing he felt.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"I&#133; I miss thy spirit. It has been difficult without thee. Olam is
bitter and jaded, no longer the brilliant hero. I am defiant, but the purpose
of my days seem to lord over a people that do nae know me. How can I mete
out justice without concern? The House&#151;what we have become&#151;falters,
the need for soul blatantly apparent t&#146; all those with even a fragment
of feeling left&#133;"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The mists swirled, but nothing moved.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"A sign&#133; anything, even an omen of spite and blame. Damn me, but
I need t&#146; hear thy voice. I have grown very old in thy absence, even
more ancient than I once seemed&#133; a creature ready to embrace the earth
and sleep. Yet&#133; there is no one t&#146; carry on my work as I would
have them, to revive that which we fought so hard for. Do ye need t&#146;
hear me beg?"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He sighed in the darkness. "Please, dearest sister. Answer the call. Did
I truly feel thy soul within Trespare? Do ye live in that na&iuml;ve girl?"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The silence answered him. "Ye can&#146;t be dead. I still suffer."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>*And you think I don&#146;t?* The voice bloomed in his head, carrying
with it the indescribable medley of nobility, passion, will, and impish delight.
</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He focused, feeling as giddy as he once did when driving Soul-Chill through
the ranks of New Outriders daring to pass the shack in the Lost Hills. **Sister,
do nae tease me! Am I mad, or do ye still survive?**</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>*Seek out Trespare. She holds a portion of the answer, dark one. I can
better commune with ye when ye are near her.*</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He stood, narrowed his eyes, and smiled. It wasn&#146;t a friendly grin,
but a malicious, powerful expression of drive and purpose behind the defiance
that fueled the dark elf. **Rest, sister. I&#146;ll seek her&#151;you&#151;out.
We have much t&#146; do.**</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He concentrated on shifting to his human guise, that of the dutiful druid
of Karana, friend of the Jagged Pine Folk and beloved of the Karana residents.
The fear of a ploy from Vox, his own madness, and a myriad of other concerns
swirled about him, but the elation&#133; the aspiration welled up within
his cold heart. He heard her faint laugh and a quiet reply, just as he shifted
realities. *I&#146;ve waited this long&#133; I can wait a bit more.*</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Out on the northern reaches of the Plains of Karana, the druid manifested,
determined to seek out Trespare and the mysteries she held within her.</I>
<P ALIGN=Center>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Trespare knelt down and laid her cheek against the soft and cool grass
of the earth. Closing her eyes in contentment, she allowed the earthy smells
to invade her spirit and the tiny sparkling vitality of the loam to cleanse
her of fatigue. Her slender fingers stroked each blade of grass they settled
upon, rolling the beads of moisture up to the ends and letting it fall into
the soil.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Standing once more and brushing the bits of dirt, seeds, and decaying
leaves from her armor, she surveyed the northern plains of Karana. A steady
wind blew in from the river, causing the wooden bridge behind her to creak
and groan. The giant links that acted as tension chains were cut and magically
welded from the wood of Karra trees. As such, they tended to swell or shrink
depending on the weather, providing the area around the bridge with a chorus
of noise from the movement. Rangers often found it grating upon their nerves.
They know well the necessity of wood for such uses, but to hear it wail and
shriek in high winds caused no end of suffering upon their souls. The grassy
plain before her stretched in a rolling fashion, allowing the twisting dirt
path to follow the natural hollows for protection. Small bunches of wildflowers
bloomed here and there in a colorful profusion of varieties. Spring was always
glorious here. Such natural simplicity and balance did not live on many places
in Norrath.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Striding forward slowly, Trespare edged her way off the path and followed
a barely discernable bunch of tracks. Her sensitive eyes picked up the tell-tail
trace of a Highland Lion's passage, and she knew she could use the meat later
in the eve for trade or dinner. If she was lucky, she could get both out
of it. Running a thumb over the notched pole of her Shiny Brass Halberd,
she topped a gentle rise and pulled it from the simple leather straps that
held it to her pack. The wind picked up here on the open top of the hill,
and she had to take a moment to brush the clinging strands of auburn hair
away from her eyes. It was just this one moment, this one second of inattention,
which caused her to fall. Blinded by her own whipping hair, she teetered
forward and lost her grip on the halberd. It rolled off to the side, held
by the dew soaked grass. Her hands came forward in a feeble attempt to stall
her descent, but to no avail. Too quickly for her to get them fully in place,
she pitched down face first. A sudden sharp pain stabbed at her temples and
startlingly deep darkness rushed to up to fold her soul in its embrace. Just
before succumbing to it, Trespare could have sworn she heard a voice, much
like her own, sighing into the winds. The soft and pleading tone of it pulled
at her soul as it slipped beneath the black velvet covers.</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Mindari wandered along the meandering path towards the docks in the Dwarven
region of Butcherblock. She had traveled here to trade with the Dwarven merchants
for valuable weapons and stones. The Master of Tunare, high cleric of the
temple she was an initiate at had bid her to trade the spell scrolls she
carried for the highly prized maces and Dwarven ringmail tunics they could
provide.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>It being her first foray out this far, she had packed with much care the
night before and prayed before the temple's sacred alter for guidance. Usually
her prayers were answered in a rush of peace and tingling power, but this
time they were not. She knew something was wrong, but was reluctant to bring
it to her Master's attention. They may well have cancelled her trip for a
ritual cleansing, letting another initiate go on this much sought after duty.
Besides, didn't the church teachings tell her to be independent in her own
faith?</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>A small voice issued from in front of her as she neared the door to the
first merchant's shop.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>" Hail lass, are ye needing a bit O'brew fer yer trip?" the small halfling
grinned at her, thrusting his right hand forward with a bottle, while at
the same time reaching for her belt pouch.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"NO!" Crying out, Mindari stepped swiftly backwards, tripping over her
long white robe and sprawling herself out in the dusty street. Her whole
body arched backwards from the pain of her landing. An evil twisting pain
crawled up her legs and shot up her spine as she tensed her muscles in
preparation to struggle back to her feet. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>" Oh lassie..ye be a bit clumsy no?" chuckling at her, the halfling took
advantage of her twisting confusion to reach out and relieve her of her belt
pouch. Deftly tucking it into one of the many small pockets sewn in his jerkin,
he swatted her dirty rump and scuttled off, losing himself quickly in the
crowd.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Tears of pain and shame burst from her eyes, and she struggled up, intending
to chase the little man down and demand the return of her goods. It was then
that she realized with a sudden insight, that her legs would not work, and
a strange lassitude was working its way over her.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"What?" the words had barely escaped her pale lips when her eyes closed
and she crumpled to the dust unconscious. A pale golden light flared about
her form, causing all the passerby who had stopped to help to raise a hand
and shield their eyes. Moments later, she was gone. Only the freshly disturbed
dirt in the street and the tiny imprints from her sandals remained.</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The druid known as Dhirge covered the land quickly, the spirit of the
wolf filling him with a fleetness of foot denied the vast majority. He skirted
around the low-flying griffons, the hill giants that stomped over the plains,
the occasional Highland lion seeking a meal, searching for the ranger called
Trespare. He desperately wished he had mastered what Olam had tried teaching
him in Sosaria&#133; the skill of tracking. He had learned a bit, but not
enough. His guildmaster in Surefall swore he would instruct him soon, but
it seemed a lifetime away, and he needed the prowess now.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Where are thee?" he whispered, cresting a small hill and stopping by
the smooth bark of a young Karra tree. He gazed across the land before him,
the tranquil waves of grass and gentle sloops of hills, and inhaled the spring
air. It held the promise of a storm to come, or seasonal rains just past.
The Lord of Thunder loved the omen of lightning, the pounding of rains upon
the plains that honored his name, but Shiver had enough tumult. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>It was only hours before he had asked his daharil if she had seen Trespare,
since the pale lady also hunted the plains. After her usual disregard for
his responsibilities, the petty jealousy and contempt for anything else that
breathed, she inquired if he should need anything from the plains, and he
had dutifully requested the head of Karana. What the Jagged Pine Folk did
not know&#133; wouldn&#146;t hurt them. Yet.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>What he wanted was the truth. Did she live on, somehow, in the body of
the wood elf, Trespare? He sighed, frustrated at being so close to the answer,
and leaned against the tree. He closed his eyes, reeling against a sudden
ache that raced within him. The crescendo of sadness rose to a gale and he
heard the voice breathe out--"Brother&#133;"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Despite the distance, it was as loud as a booming vernal thunder.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>His eyes snapped open, scanning the horizon. In the distance, he caught
a glimpse of the brilliant green of an ivy-etched tunic. Shiver hastened
towards the falling figure, his bear-hide boots crushing the grasses, spraying
the dew of Karana in open defiance of his so-called patron god. His narrowed
eyes, distressed expression, revealed what he hadn&#146;t dared to hope
for&#133; she survived the curse of the Night Dragon. A wry, unbound thought
bloomed like the wild flowers in his mind&#133; trust the resiliency of a
dragon.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He approached the fallen flesh and blood form that held the spirit of
his Queen.</I>

<I>The bloody fire drake carcass lay across the gray and barren rocks of
Lavastorm The light from the lava pits caused its scales to flicker and glimmer
in a red-hued dance of mystery and shadow. The small blue-skinned female
rummaged inside the gaping wound left from her dagger and pulled out the
quivering stomach. It glistened in her palm, coating her hand with body fluids
and stomach contents as she sliced it open and withdrew several sticky gold
coins and a polished fire drake scale. Throwing the fleshy sac down on the
rock, she ignored the sickening plop of its landing, and rubbed her thumb
over the small ruby scale in her palm. It would bring a good price in Neriak
at the vendor stalls.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>One of the sharp edges cut into her palm as she admired it. Ignoring the
brief burst of pain and the itchy stinging as the drake's blood found its
way inside, she smiled and placed her lips over the cut, using her tongue
to cleanse the clots from around it. Smearing the bitter bloody fluid over
her lips so she could savor it later, she turned and looked off into the
steamy mist. Billowing clouds of sulfur and numerous other gases forced her
eyes to strain, giving her a headache. Deciding she was going to return to
the cool darkness of the forest today, she trotted down the rocky shelf towards
the pass and ran quickly past the elementals and dervishes that sought to
block the unwary ones path.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>By the time she reached the cool shadows of the deep gorge that led to
the final pass, she was panting and weary. Sweat streamed down her dark skin,
running in rivulets over her blackened armor. The salty fluid burned inside
the numerous cuts and an abrasion on her skin, setting parts of her breasts
and legs on fire. Quivering in pain, yet smiling still, she savored each
twisting stabbing pain. Her voice, taut with tension, melted softly away
into the darkening air. "yes&#133;Always it is like this&#133;Always do you
seek to free yourself!" Cackling suddenly, she threw her head back in laughter,
causing her white hair to spill out in a long coiling mass and brush the
pebbles on the trail. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>" You are up to something - I can feel it. How long now? I feel your pitiful
struggling! What is it you are doing?" Turning suddenly, Eclipse wrenched
her pack off her back and rummaged through it. Grasping a small glass vial
in her hand, she plucked it from the nest of spider silk it had lain in and
held it up to the dim light cast from the lava fires. A small globule of
blood floated in the clear liquid, floating and twirling in an endless
dance.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Eclipsed's deep green eyes narrowed thoughtfully. Running a nail down
the outside of the vial, she watched the blood quiver away from the sharp
presence on the outside. The vibrations caused by her nail could not be
pleasant.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>" I see it now." Nodding, Eclipse grasped the vial tightly in her hand
and picked up her pack once more. " I will have the rest of you, and then
your torment will truly begin! I will have to take some of my soul for this
journey, but it will be worth it." Ever since she had found herself cast
here on this God forsaken mudball of a planet, she had not been able to work
any of her godly magic. The only way she could access any of it was to suck
a portion of her own soul away, forever diminishing her power and her knowledge.
The soft and guttural words from her lips brought the magic of the air to
her call and allowed it to feed from her soul. Taking a sharply drawn breath,
she finished the incantation and quickly cut the tie before the magic consumed
her utterly. A heavy darkening mist formed before her, building in size until
it fully engulfed her and hid her from view. Within moments, it was gone,
dissipating quickly back into the muggy air. There was no trace of the drow
it had covered.</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Eclipsed stepped from the fading mist into full daylight. The magical
portal had brought her halfway around the realms in a fraction of a second.
The unsteadiness she felt was more related to the sudden shift of reality
and the blinding light than the cost of the spell, so when she abruptly realized
she was standing over a prone elven form, she took full advantage of it.
Darting her eyes side to side, making sure no one was near, she laughed at
her good fortune and stooped to grasp some of the long pale hair of her newest
acquisition. Apparently, she was deep in some thrall or trance, since the
sudden yank didn't stir her at all. Chuckling softly to herself, Eclipse
quickly retrieved some leather thongs from her pack and bound the small
high-elven form tightly. Small red marks appeared near the bonds, marking
the beginning stages of blood loss in the extremities.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Heaving the limp form up on her shoulder with surprising strength, Eclipsed
set about making the most of this unexpected boon. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Who cares why my spell failed to take me nearer her. This should do to
at least bring out the wasted one. I am sure that her spirit, or what's left
of it will be near him&#133;"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The violent shaking of the glass vial in her pack went unnoticed as Eclipse
trudged towards the city last known to hold the Master of House
Winterborne.</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Walking stiffly away from the revelers outside Qeynos, Rianna blended
in with the crowds going into the city and made her way slowly to the far
end of town. Her thoughts whirled in a mixed maelstrom of confusion. Her
soul fairly shivered in this new form, only now starting to understand and
learn what it was capable of. Leaning back against the cool stones of a half
wall near the fountains, She slipped a hand across her eyes to hide the sudden
tears that threatened to make thier way down her face. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"They do not know...I did not know...Please, Celestial One, guide me here."
Her voice emerged from these new lips, strange and yet the same, filled with
the power of her prayer. Leaning her head back, Rianna peered out at this
strange new darkening sky, and placed her hand over Trespare's unknowing
gift. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Why?" She cried into the winds, "Her honor knows no limits, her sacrifice
no bounds, must she also suffer this loss?" </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The quivering of her stomach and the queazy rush of heat to her head did
not give her an answer or an absolution. </I>
