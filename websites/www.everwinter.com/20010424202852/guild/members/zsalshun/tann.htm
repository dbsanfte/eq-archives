	    <TD><I>The little gnome bounced into the room. He always bounced, more or
	      less, having about three times the energy that his tiny body could really
	      hold. In fact, it was a dire day indeed when there wasn&#146;t some sort
	      of spring to the steps of the overactive deep gnome. Today was no exception.

	<I>"Hey Saph! Hey Tanner! How&#146;s things? Just been to..well, I&#146;m
	not quite sure where, but Meg and the clan have left Solon. Not sure why
	either, they were up in arms about er&#133;fading or disintegrating or being
	spit out or something of that nature. Or was that their magic?" He paused
	in the narrative to scratch his bald pate. For one momentous moment the small
	deep gnome was lost in thought and quiet. However, the moment passed as briefly
	as it came and he punctuated his next sentence with a crinkled ear to ear
	smile. "I didn&#146;t have any trouble&#133;see? Still intact, even my magic,
	but I got sucked into the backwash of some spell or the other and BLAM I
	blew up a large portion of this new place. Well, that wasn&#146;t my intention
	really but I&#146;m glad cause otherwise I think I would have blown up the
	Arie again. Don&#146;t tell Shiv OK?"</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>The genuine look of guilt and concern on the minute gray face caused Saphrael
	to burst out laughing. Tanner just shook his head, catching about one in
	eight words of what the infernal gnome was talking about. As usual, his graceful
	wife took the situation in hand and welcomed Tan back from his travels. The
	little gnome prattled on, perfectly oblivious to Tanner&#146;s bemused expression
	as Saphrael listened intently to the narrative. The stately elven woman had
	worked more closely with Tan on Faerun and was able to follow the rapid speech
	with little loss of content.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"&#133;AND I am more or less mostly a gnome now. At least I have been
	so on the last handful of lands I have visited." Again, the deep gnome grinned
	a wide toothy grin and accented it with a short bow to no one in particular.
	"Although, I wouldn&#146;t mind finding myself in my true form every so often."
	The grin faded for a split second as his fingers absently fiddled with the
	odd dark speckled choker around his neck. The piece locked away his birthright
	and most of the powers associated with it and probably would even after the
	day the little gnome was laid to rest.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Tan shrugged as his face brightened once more. "Course, it&#146;s much
	safer to be a gnome in most of these places eh? Well, if I want my wings
	and tail I suppose I could always step into Faerun and hope. Nuff of that,
	where&#146;d everyone wind up?"</I>
