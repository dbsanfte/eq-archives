	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>All guild members are required to enact their characters in an in-character,
	role-playing fashion when speaking aloud (shout or&nbsp;speaking).
	Out-of-character comments must be designated as OOC, either through
	&#147;OOC:&#148; or double parenthesis surrounding the comment.
	&nbsp;Roleplaying is central to House Winterborne. We are willing to teach
	those with an interest, but we seek skilled role-players as recruits.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><I><B>II. &nbsp;Thou shalt nae create discord among
	thy fellows.</B></I></FONT>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>All guild members are expected to behave in a mature fashion. No harrassment,
	profanity, or vulgarity will be tolerated. No hacking will be accepted. Dynamic
	role-playing is acceptable, but consider the interests and welfare of your
	guild-mates. Arguments are good sources of character development, but petty
	bickering adds nothing positive to the gaming experience.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><I><B>III. &nbsp;Thou shalt reply the wishes of House
	officers promptly and to the best of thy abilities.</B></I></FONT>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Electronic mail from guild officers (indicated on the roster) should be
	answered promptly and with as much detail as needed. Administration functions
	should be secondary to the role-playing; officers who donate their time to
	these tasks should be treated with respect. If a player is going on a leave
	of absence of more than two weeks, we request notification.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><I><B>IV. &nbsp;Thou shalt be permitted inheritance
	and assistance from the wealth of t&#146; House.</B></I></FONT>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>House Winterborne allows what is commonly referred to as
	&#147;twinking&#148;, giving items to other characters that are beyond their
	means. We prefer these cases of gifting aren&#146;t exorbitant. Use your
	best judgement.</I>

	be offered first t&#146; the benefit of thy House mates.</B></I></FONT>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>When items are found, before auctioning them through the general channels,
	make certain the guild members have a five (5) day period to purchase them
	for a fair price. Gifts are always welcome, but we understand characters
	earn their &#147;living&#148; on their finds.</I>

	<I>PvP is
	supported&nbsp;by&nbsp;the&nbsp;House&nbsp;within&nbsp;the&nbsp;boundaries
	of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Neverwinter&nbsp;Consortium servers.</I>

	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><I><B>NOTE:</B></I></FONT>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Our guild is not &#147;aligned&#148; and not exclusive. This means characters
	of all moral and ethical stances can be found within the group. Likewise,
	players are free to have other characters in other guilds. Our guild exists
	to add to Neverwinter&nbsp;gaming experience, providing a dynamic story-line
	for role-playing, as well as traditional guild benefits. Maturity among our
	members is expected and exceptions are quickly dealt with.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><I><B>Alternate/Secondary Characters:</B></I></FONT>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Once a player is accepted into House Winterborne, they may add up to two
	alternate characters to the roster provided they have submitted a seperate
	character history. Exceptions to this rule may be granted by guild
	officers.</I>

	<I> Neverwinter doesn&#146;t provide a great deal of structure for some serious
	role-playing issues. The guild has agreed to some ideas to provide a bit
	of continuity and depth to our role-playing. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I><IMG SRC="bar.gif" WIDTH="510" HEIGHT="19" BORDER="0" ALIGN="Middle"></I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I><B>Maxim</B>: A character&#146;s true class, and even gender or race,
	may differ greatly from the game mechanics. A human might be "part" Tanar'ri
	and exhibit traits such as claws, hissing, and the like. A druid might consider
	himself a conjurer, or even a ranger. Accept the role-playing and ignore
	the game mechanics. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I><B>Maxim</B>: A character&#146;s level doesn&#146;t indicate their power
	or strength. Surname&#146;s indicate an acknowledgment of the citizens of
	Norrath or the character&#146;s guild. As a guild, we may role-play a fourth
	level necromancer as a powerful character (the equivalent of a 20th level
	character) or a 18th level enchanter, as a young and unworldly prodigy. This
	is left up to the player, though we encourage some realism.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I><B>Maxim</B>: Not all characters are natives of the Forgotten Realms (Toril).
	Characters from other worlds may well find themselves in Neverwinter. Some
	characters within the guild hail from other online games, such as Ultima
	Online, the Realm, Norrath (EQ), or the Dark Ages of Camelot setting. Such
	histories are encouraged and can be worked into the history of Neverwinter;
	said characters are plane-travelers; they may have a much weaker form in
	Neveriwnter, perhaps taking time (experience) to master magic, or the laws
	of the world.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I><B>Maxim</B>: Real life time limitations do not equate to a character
	being absent from Neverwinter. Characters can be assumed to have an existence
	beyond the time their player enacts them. If the player is absent for three
	weeks, perhaps the character has been at work learning a language, a trade
	skill, visiting a relative, spying on an enemy, or even on another plane.
	Character absence, particularly when a player has an extended leave, *can*
	be explained by the player, but it isn&#146;t required.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I><B>Maxim</B>: A character does not die when they loose a battle. Instead,
	we assume that a character that falls in battle is saved at the last moment
	by a "death pact" within the House; this Winterborne character is teleported
	away to a safe spot. Other characters outside of the guild might be saved
	by the magic of their guilds, their own contingencies, or their guardian
	power (god or goddess). A cleric resurrection spell allows character&#146;s
	to be brought back to life, however, if the player of the deceased character
	so desires; otherwise, they are simply drawn from their bind spot.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Other Maxims will be added to this list if they are needed to further
	our pursuit of role-playing.</I>
