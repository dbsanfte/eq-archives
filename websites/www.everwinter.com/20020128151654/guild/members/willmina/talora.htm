	<I>So, 'ere I be, sittin' on the ramp t' Black Burrah, waitn' fer this nasta
	storm ta pass, wit' a bit o' time to kill. The pass ta Halas be blocked onna
	count o' the storm, so I'm campin' 'ere this eve. &nbsp;Me lantern's ful
	o' oil, and me bear skins er nice 'n warm, so I'll take this time ta give
	ye a recount o' me self.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Me father Bannin McTavish was a rouge barbarian, who lived th'life o'
	a hunter. Many a night he would be gone, checking his traps, er trackin'
	a bear. My mum Taralenne, would take the skins and sew 'em up inta belts
	'n cloaks 'n boots n' other such clothin'.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Me, I took on a likeness to me father, and grew strong earlah. Some times
	e'd take me wi' 'im on 'is short huntin' trips, and 'e'd lemme take a cubb'er
	two. He was always verra proud o' me on' th'day I'd taken a full bear, and
	he rewarded me givin' me by makin' th' finest bear skinned hat evva tae keep
	me warm.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I ha'e nare a clue ta the ways of the autermations, until me father one
	day, e' foun' the wee baby tucked inna save spot o' the ol' abandon'd tower
	ou' inna frozen Everfrost plain whilst out huntin'. I was but a wee lass,
	only a fist o' years old a' th'time. But I kin still remembah the look in
	'is eyes, and the vision 'e saw. Sumthin' aboot this child gave 'im quite
	a stirr! Well, for sure he broot the little lass back tae Halas wi' 'im,
	and me mother took 'er in and fed her n' kept 'er till she was able ta stand
	the trip to Qeynos, for the litta lass was a human babe, and far too frail
	fer the harsh life 'ere in Halas. Me father was kinna wurried 'bout goin'
	thru Black Burrah, an' all the nasta dogs that nested there. I swore then
	I'd clean those pups from the face er Norrather, ifn' they hurt me pops,
	or th' littl lass.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Father began 'is trip to the human citta earla that spring, an' made it
	thru Black Burrah easy 'nuff, since all the dogs were interested in was makin'
	more dogs. Father returned 3days hence, wi' a grieved look onna 'is face,
	but 'e looked ta be relieved as well. We sent note 'tae the orphaner fella
	that kept the young lass, toe see hae she be farin'. We soon got word that
	litta Willminer was doin' jes fine. As we'd aged, she an' I kept a passin'
	notes as best we could, and consider er'selves tae be cuzins.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I soon grew wearah of huntin' the frozen lands of Everfrost, ever fearfull
	'o the Mammoths, an' Ice Giants tha' roamed the land there. I tol' me mum
	and father tha' I be needin' to see me cuzin anna ways, so me Father spake
	w'th' Fighters circle, and I was allowed 'tae join in w' their trainin'.
	I advanced thru th'ranks quicklah, an' was givin' a nice sword by a generus
	clan member for enterin' me 5th season o' practice.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>W' me new weapon in han', an a chest full o' pride, I began th' journee
	ta' Qeynos. I made good time thru the Everfrost mountains, an' arrived soon
	enuf tae the entrance tae Black Burrah. I drew me sword, and crept up behin'
	a rock, and saw the pair o' dogs guardin' the entrance. I waited 'till one
	'ad his fill o' meade, an' th' sun hae gone. I sprang fro' me hidin' place
	and cut 'is gizzard cleanly, and turned tae the other. By then e' had grabbed
	'is piece, an' we wen' at it for a good spell. Victorah was mine! The weak
	guard was soft, and was lackin' disapline. I wiped me sword clean an' follered
	th' cave thru the mountian. Ween I cae' acrost the few gnolls in me path,
	they fell quicklah and silentlah. I neer' wanted tae meet a troop o'guards
	w' armor an' big axes, an' 'ave 'em chasin' me back tae Everfrost!</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Finallah I mae it tae the innah village. Tae me relief, many fighters
	of all creed 'n cullah were givin' th' dogs what for! I gave me help tae
	a few tha' be strugglin' but most were verrah impressive, takin' on several
	dogs atta time! At las' I foun' the exit tae the hills, and made a hastah
	retreat. A days hike took mae to the citah. It wood 'ah takin' me long enough
	tae find 'er, but the guard fellah at the gate wuz kind 'nuff tae show me
	th'way t'th' mage guild.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>What a joyus reunion we 'ad! I'll ne'er fergit th' look on me cuzin's
	face when I tol' her who I be! She then cried 'n carried on so! Then pulled
	me thru th' city an' she promptlah mae me stan' neer the gate o' the city
	and did one o' her majikin's on me. It was quite a queer feelin' lemmah tell
	ye! Now I kin stay in Qeynos fer a while, an' nae have ta worrah aboot travellin'
	thru Black Burrah tae git back tae th'city. She all-sah showed me the way
	tae th' Karanas, an' Now I be huntin' lions an' grizzlies fer meat n' skins
	tae paye fer lodgin'. I be still fresh tae this lan', an' I figger it'll
	tae me a bit o' time beferr I get tae unnastand this lan'. I'm not as quick
	mindin' as me cuzin, but she ne'er be able tae hold me sword neither! Har
	Har!</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>She alsa intraduzzed mah tae th' friends she'd made, 'an I foun' een'
	more folk I took a likin' tah as well. They alsa gave me a chance tae be
	in tha Guild! What a happah day! I gladlah took Dirge's offa, an' I've been
	a part o' the house for menna a season now.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>'Tween roustin' the dogs in Black Burrah and vistin' mae folks, ye kin'
	see me on th'plains in Karanas. But heed th'warnin'! They be bandits about
	at night, an' ye can ne'er be sure if in they be alone! So hold ye purses
	tight! Me next trip tae Halas will be includin' a few roun' o' trainin' a'
	th' warrior camp. Ye kin then be sure th' bandits will soon be runnin' from
	yers truly, Talora of the clan McTavish, membah of the 'Ouse o' Wintaborne!</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Well, me lamps neer to outta oil, an' the sun be sunkin' behin' th' mountian.
	Me ink is beginnin' tae freeze! Time fer some shut eye. Mae yer sword be
	evva sharp, and yer wits sharpa still!</I>
