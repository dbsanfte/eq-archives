<I>Flutrose read the missive from Dirge, and tossed it aside while uttering
a mild oath under her breath. Dirge had no understanding, no understanding
at all of how his actions were affecting her life. He thought he dabbled
in politics, whereas her own heart and soul were at stake. If only he would
not tarry so as he went about his business! Flutrose hugged herself, and
tried to quell her growing unease. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She had first heard of Veeshan, the Wyrm Queen, the night she met Erondis.
Twas he who educated her in the wisdom and lore of the dragons. Ever since
that night, she had felt whispers of beckoning in the back of her mind,
steadfastly trying to draw her attention; each time she became aware of the
intruder into her thoughts, she resolutely blocked them into a tiny, dark
chamber locked deep within her mind. For she felt that to ackowledge this
presence, for it was indeed a presence, would be an affront to Quellious.
Therefore she strove mightily to ignore the voice, which seemed to increase
in volume as well as persistence each day. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>But it was not a true voice, in the sense that it was vocal&#133;it was
rather like a feeling that gave rise to utterances, without a corporeal voice.
Flutrose staunched the emotions that sought to overwhelm her, and allowed
her mind to drift to thoughts of her friends. For as much as she cherished
knowledge and learning, she loved her friends more. Erondis, who Peony so
aptly described as &#147;foppish&#148; and &#147;arrogant.&#148; She smiled
at the thought. Aye, he is indeed those things; but he has such casual elegance,
and such incredible knowledge! And Zepheris, the man of so many deep thoughts
and feelings, the silent one who worked so hard to build a shell betweenst
himself and the world. He was a confidant as well as a hunting companion.
Peony she had met but once, on Erud&#146;s Isle. That day Flutrose had been
hunting zombie sailors with Erondis and another, a dwarf named Aahira. She
had seen the disappointment that Peony struggled to hide when Erondis told
her that she could not hunt with him. Upon departing the hunting group that
day, Flutrose had whispered to Erondis suggesting that he invite Peony to
join the group in her stead. She smiled, hoping that one day had done even
just a small amount to advance the friendship between Erondis and Peony.

<I>And Sharhel, the great hulking Barbarian wench who towered over Flutrose!
The sun glinting from her armor had almost blinded Flutrose when first they
met, in the West Karanas. Shar had offered aid in transferring ownership
of a nasty, rotting rib bone to the monk Mica. Flutrose grimaced slightly
at the memory. After cajoling Shar to leave her hunting and travel to a meeting
spot, Flutrose had made the disconcerting discovery that she had left the
wretched bone in her bank vault! Flutrose imagined that Sharhel still laughed
at her for such a foolish lapse of brainpower. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Flutrose giggled as she thought of Mott, the monk who had so brazenly
informed her that he had taken no foolish vow of chastity. Becoming lost
in her memories, Flutrose laid down upon her bed and closed her eyes. She
thought of Kazzander, the Dark Elf who had earned himself a lifetime supply
of summoned bandages, and of Olam, who had so graciously offered to supply
her with a Halas Heater if she could but give him the recipe and ingredients.
Flutrose felt truly blessed in being allowed to care for all of these people;
tendrils of the feelings of loneliness she had once suffered crept into being,
but were diffused with a slight smile, as she remembered the antics of two
amusing Trolls she had once met, named Chudd and Krudd. How anyone could
constantly pick at their bottomsides, and in public too, was beyond her!
</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Flutrose let out a sigh, as weariness overcame her. The memories drifted
into the distance, and the wings of sleep overtook her mind. Then the dream
began to take hold, shaping itself and unfurling until it sapped at the core
of her being. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>In the dream, Flutrose was praying at the Temple of Quellious, the Tranquil
One, in Erudin. As she prayed a voice engulfed her, invisible currents of
power that swirled around her body and confused her mind. &#147;There is
more to peace than knowledge. Knowledge without intellect is for naught.
Unfold thy wings, and use your knowledge to seek intellect, strength, and
wisdom. For ye too have wings, if ye but allow yourself to see them.&#148;
A feeling of weightlessness overcame Flutrose, and she felt her body float
atop little puffs of breeze, ever going higher and higher. She looked down,
to gaze upon the land, and saw that she was sitting atop a mythical creature,
which looked greatly like a flying serpent with wings. She instinctively
knew that this was a dragon, one of the ancient children of Veeshan. She
cried out in fear and gripped the beast as tightly as she could, her fingernails
torn and bleeding as she grasped at the scales that were both smooth and
rough, her inner thighs chafing as she clung tightly with her legs. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The dragon did not speak, but Flutrose felt reassurance flow into herself
from its body, and was comforted. &#147;I am where I truly belong&#148; she
thought. She then leaned forward slightly, to see the land over the front
of the beast&#146;s wings. What she saw turned her heart cold. The land appeared
as a vast, frozen tundra of nothingness. The cities were gone, leaving nothing
more than shards of ice gleaming in a sea of stark white emptiness. Here
and there she viewed tiny spots of darkness that appeared to be bodies struggling
against blasts of frigid gales, the ignorance of the snow piling up about
them as they flailed their arms and struggled against the encroaching darkness,
blood seeping in frozen circles about them as they sought to extricate themselves
from the tyranny of the unknowing and uncaring land. She screamed as her
mind closed in on the figures, and she viewed Erondis and Zepheris and all
her other friends below her, and knew that they were lost to her. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Flutrose awoke, the sound of her scream still fresh in her ears. &#147;I
am going mad&#148; she thought. &#147;Tis the only explanation, my faculties
are leaving me. What if I lose my mind, and can no longer remember my friends,
and am once again alone in the world?&#148; She curled herself into a miserable
ball in the middle of the bed, sobbing with fright and misery until exhaustion
overcame her, easig her back to sleep. Once again, the nightmare began&#133;.
