	      <I> Strangely, as Malozc tried to fit in, he only seemed to make new enemies.
	      The time spent in Highhold in particular confused him. He helped fight the
	      hoards of orcs and gnolls that punished the citizens and guards of this place,
	      yet, something seemed unclear. The thoughts would continually come back that
	      something was not right. IT was then, after a night of mastering brewing,
	      and falling asleep on the Inn's dock that he found out why.</I></TD>

	<I>The morning was bright and the sun stung his sensitive eyes. As he rolled
	over to block the light, he fell off the dock and into the cold water of
	the pass.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Screaming aloud in the water's medium he was suddenly lost of which way
	was up, excitedly he swam for an opening that promised air. As he found that
	air he realized this was not the same view he'd left.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>The walls rose and created echoes as the water dripped from his robes.
	He spied someone coming and tried to hail him but found himself stopping.
	The man had a dusty appearance, a sinister look that Malozc instantly took
	for aggressive. Quickly he summoned the shadows and hid himself. He looked
	down at the water pool beneath his feet and cursed silently. Slowly he crouched
	down and held his breath. The man came to the waters edge and reached to
	ground as if to listen. The man waited and listened. Just as if he might
	discover Malozc, another man, much like himself smacked him back, "What's
	the matter? Life of the smuggler gotcha jumpy!" His cohort laughed. "Nae,
	just a feeling." Quit worrying. Ye know we've got the guards in our pockets,
	now come back to camp, we've just gotten a pottery wheel in, a complete set
	of equipment so that we can master any skill we wish!"</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>'Aye, I suppose you're right. Let's go"</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Malozc let go a painfully held breath. "Baaasssstards! I help you by fighting
	the scourge of orcs and gnolls and ye are simply a front! His voice carried
	more than he had intended and the echo brought foot steps from the pass.
	Quickly he dove into the pool and retired to the inn. The thoughts of being
	played for a fool were too much. There would be revenge. There would be
	restitution and oh yes... there would be death. </I>

	<I>Malozc is a servant of Olam and was sent to assist House Winterborne as
	a favor to Dirge. &nbsp;The two dark elves have much in common and a penchant
	for acts of violence.</I>
