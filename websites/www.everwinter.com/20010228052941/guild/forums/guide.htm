  <I>One of the most interesting activities to participate in within the realms
  is the process of shared fiction. Every day new stories are posted on message
  boards, and many of these stories are shared efforts. One story line may
  have two, three, or even a dozen different authors, all contributing their
  own particular style and characters. The plot is usually not planned in advance.
  Instead, each author posts whenever he or she sees fit, and makes whatever
  plot advances or twists seem appropriate at the time. The end result is a
  living, breathing story and no one can really predict the outcome.</I>
  <P>
  <I> The process itself is quite simple. An author starts a story and leaves
  it incomplete. &nbsp;Another member then adds to it, advancing the plot.
  This process continues until the story is complete. Sometimes, there never
  is a true completion to the story! Subplots can live on for months, or even
  years.</I>
  <P>
  <I> Most authors use their character as the center of their own particular
  portions of the story, though this is not mandatory. Many authors make use
  of NPC's (characters that do not have any player counterpart) to advance
  the plot. Some examples have included a dwarven farmer, a goblin shaman,
  and a drow captain. Some NPC's have even become major players in a story
  line, sometimes more active than the author's own character.</I>
  <P>
  <I> Of course, any attempt at shared fiction which involves several authors
  has its pitfalls. &nbsp;Since the stories are not planned out in advance,
  often one author's contribution will drastically alter the plans of another.
  Sometimes an author will have to discard several pages that were written
  offline after reading the latest additions. While this is all part of the
  fun of shared fiction, a certain amount of discretion is advised when writing
  additions. To this end, the following guidelines have been devised to help
  new authors enjoy this facet of online roleplay. Please keep in mind they
  are only guidelines, not hard and fast rules. Still, any author should consider
  carefully before discarding them.</I>

  <I>This is the most sacred guideline of shared fiction. Most players are
  very fond of their characters, and it simply is not acceptable to kill them
  off in a story without their permission. Keep in mind this permission is
  not likely to be given, unless the player plans to retire that particular
  character permanently. This is the one rule that should never be broken for
  any reason.</I>

  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <I>Most players who involve their characters in a story line wish to keep
  that character active within the story. Hence, any maiming, dismemberment,
  feebing, etc. is usually an unwelcome turn of events if it happens without
  their permission. However, if you take certain steps, this can still be an
  acceptable plot twist. For example, should you decide that a certain character
  should get "feebed" in the story (hit with a Feeblemind spell), you might
  mention in passing that he or she was near a temple at the time of the atrocity.
  Therefor, a quick trip to the priest could cure the character handily, allowing
  that individual to continue in the story unimpaired. Note that cuts, bruises
  and other wounds are quite acceptable to hand out, even rather nasty ones.</I>

  <I>Don't make another players' character, guild, etc. look foolish or inept
  in your story telling. This, of course, is not relevant if the other player
  is intentionally PLAYING a foolish or inept character. In that case, have
  a ball.</I>

  <I>NPC's, while usually not as important as players' characters, are still
  to be treated carefully by those authors who did not introduce them into
  the story line. When an author introduces an NPC, it's usually for a good
  reason that may not become clear for some time. Any major changes to that
  NPC (like death) could drastically alter the course of the story, possibly
  ruining that author's plans. Some extra leeway may be taken in this area,
  however, as ruining an author's plan is not nescessarily a bad thing, and
  most authors are fully aware that once an NPC is introduced he or she becomes
  fair game for other authors. In other words, you are free to make alterations
  to another author's NPC's, but do so with discretion.</I>

  <I>While we all like to play the hero, remember your character is a mortal
  being with limitations. Don't try to solve every problem yourself. Your
  character's strengths are all the more dramatic after his or her weaknesses
  have been examined as well. If your character tends to solve every situation
  single handed, this means other characters will be stuck as second stringers
  most of the time. There's plenty of glory to go around, so let others share
  in it. Also, failures can be just as interesting to read about as
  victories.</I>

  <I>When writing about an event that is large in scope, such as a major battle,
  let it evolve slowly. Shared fiction is a slow process, and should be treated
  as such. Allow every author a chance to get involved, and leave them openings
  to take advantage of. A single battle could take dozens of posts to resolve
  if there are many characters involved in it. If you end it too abrubptly,
  some characters may not get to see any action at all.</I>

  <P ALIGN=Center>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <I>This is more of a general writing guideline than a guideline about shared
  fiction, but it doesn't hurt to mention it. When a situation is finally resolved,
  resolve it in a believable fashion. Don't rely on divine intervention, magical
  items that had not been mentioned previously, or the like. Everything should
  be clearly plausable within the laws of the AD&amp;D universe. If you can't
  find a believable way out of a tough situation, take it like a dwarf. The
  other authors won't allow anything too terrible happen to your character.</I>

  <I>Once again, all of the above (except for #1) are guidelines. There may
  indeed be times when it is appropriate to ignore one or more of them, but
  do so carefully.</I> &nbsp; <I> Also, <FONT COLOR="#8080ff">DON'T HESITATE
  TO E-MAIL OTHER AUTHORS </FONT>with questions, possible plot twists, etc.
  etc. Some storylines work best with some some rough planning in advance,
  however vague.</I>
  <P>
  <I> Most importantly, have fun and don't be afraid to get involved! Most
  authors like nothing more than having new writers jump into their storylines
  and muddy the waters a bit. If you're feeling a bit uncertain, E-mail them
  and ask beforehand. Odds are you'll get nothing but encouragement.</I>
