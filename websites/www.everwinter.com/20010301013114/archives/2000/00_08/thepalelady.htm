<I>The midday sun beat down on the witch's coif, making her uncomfortable.
She pulled it off and shook loose a thick mane of auburn hair. Turning to
Balkin and the others, she called out, "it isn't much farther now." She eyed
the motley entourage while running backwards. Some old friends, some new.
Some not friends at all, but kindred nonetheless, in that they all had a
common goal, unraveling the mysteries of Winter.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin glanced up, as he ran along side the barbarian. She was awfully
excited, and unless she was killing something, that was unusual. He had no
idea what she was up to, but running across these damnable plains was annoying
him. He sighed, as she declared "not much farther now" and kept on running.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Finally, they reached the crest of a hill and she paused. Before them
stood the beginnings of a huge complex. The outer walls of the vast stronghold
were complete, outlining an enormous parcel of the southwestern corner of
South Karana. Unmanned parapets dotted the fortified walls.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin immediately started judging the stone work. Even from a distance,
his critical dwarven eye was drawn to several points along the wall and around
the gate. He frowned suddenly&#133; Human work, he thought to himself.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"What do ye think? Ye can't see it from here, but the area inside is parceled
off. There is a market square, an arena, and a sizeable spot that's been
set aside just for us. I was hoping we'd make this our home away from home.
The guards in Qeynos are lazy. Here, we'll be amply protected. The guards
will be paid well but beaten severely, should they slack off." The pale lady
smirked as she watched Fallon's mouth gape open. "Well, they aren't the reliable
constructs Daddy was capable of creating on Toril, but I think we can keep
them in line. I'm kidding! I'm kidding! I have no intention of using untrained
civilians. I'm hoping we can entice a few of the Brokenblades in joining
us here."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"What do I think? I think ye hired humans to do the walls didn't ye? Bah,
dwarves woulda been better. We've got the best stone mason's on Norrath.
Still, I guess they be adequate."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The pale lady rumbled with laughter at the thought. "I think your eyes
are tired, ye crotchety ole dwarf! That IS the work of your kin! Come, let's
give ye a closer look. Have ye met m'brother yet, Balkin? Like ye, Tanner
would ne'er let me do such a fool thing. Besides, I've been around long enough
to know who knows what about building something that'll stand the test of
time."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin scowled and scrutinized the stonework. "Hmmph. Human guards I take
it? Might better get yerself some elves, and dwarves as well. Ye'll need
someone that can see through the dark. Better yet, if ye know some mercenary
company we can trust, might be better to bring an established group in. Won't
need to beat em often if they be established, and well paid besides. Ye
understand, I'll be wantin' to test anyone hired to guard me new guild home
yes?" Looking way up at Sharhel's face, he spoke again, cutting her off,
"Don't even argue girl, ye heard me."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Shar smirked at Zsalshun, "I'm counting on it, Balkin. I think ye'll find
your match among most of the BrokenBlades." </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>As his Spirit of the wolf faded, Balkin joined the group, walking through
the gate. "Broken Blades? These be some o yer friends from yer past yes?
I guess, if ye trust them, that would be acceptable. I'll be meeting with
their captain before any final decision is made though. Warclaw's job be
to protect the clans, and I'll nae shirk the responsibility."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Indeed! And I believe ye may have already met their captain, Tanner.
If he agrees to work with us on this, I think the two of ye would make an
excellent team for devising and constructing the compound." The pale lady
beamed enthusiastically. She didn't share the dwarf's sense of responsibility,
but appreciated his zeal nonetheless. "And this here will be the market area.
Those two connecting buildings there are mine, another reason I wanted to
move out here. I doubt the folks in Qeynos would agree with the business.
On the left will be the Tin Man, a gambling casino named as a tribute to
Blood Eyes, a legend among wyrms. And next to that will be Auril's Delight,
an ice cream parlor/brothel." </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Bah, I donna think I want to know what will be goin on in there either,
just don't get yerself killed girl." Shaking his head, Balkin grinned. "And
a casino as well, eh? Bah, games of chance always favor the house. But, since
we be the house, it can't all be that bad. And ice cream. Tried that once
in Qeynos. Too damnable sweet fer me. Might be fine fer ye tall folk, but
not fer me". Glancing at Fhallon, he replied slyly, "a brothel though, now
that might be a fine addition!"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>With a smirk, Shar continued reassuringly, "Oh now, don't be too concerned.
I know ye are all wondering how we'll make ice cream without milk. I've already
chatted with vendors in Qeynos and they've agreed to sell a few of their
most coveted milk cows. Well, they don't look like any cow I've ever seen,
but that's what they call them." </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin removed his helm, and shook out his deep auburn hair. "Bah, Cows
be fer eatin! Far more useful that way if ye ask me."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Shar gave Balkin a queer look and continued, "As for the brothel, I wouldn't
fret over that too much either. I'm merely doing my civic duty to bring a
much needed service to Norrath!" Shar laughed, ignoring Fallon's look of
shocked disapproval.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin roared his laughter, at the scandalized look Fhallon had on her
face. She really needed to get out more.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"So ye see, there is plenty of room for other trades vendors. I plan on
having a forge built and whatever else we need. Winterborne members will
get first dibs on a store front, should ye be interested in selling your
wares." </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>With a calculating look, Balkin watched Fhallon's face light up, at the
thought of a store. Then again, maybe she shouldn't get out much. She was
a gentle soul to her core, and though she had skills, in combat, she much
preferred the home guard. He thought maybe she had found a home to guard
indeed. And he was equally sure that she would sell anything he made for
a small commission. Perhaps he needed to sit down with her, and give her
a bit of help with her tailoring. She was coming along well, but still had
a long way to go.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"We'll need a forge lass, that be true. And it should be one of us that
mans it. Makaz be more than capable, and a master smith as well. Ye should
approach him, and see if he wishes to take over permanent operations. He'll
let us novices use it on occasion, perhaps even tutor us a bit, till we be
masters as well. It can only be good for the Winterborne."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Excellent idea, Balkin."</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The pale lady led the group through what was to be the market square and
to another open area. "And this, if ye wish it, will be the new, or alternate,
base of operations for Winterborne. As ye see, I've nae begun the construction.
I wanted to get your input first. If ye are nae interested, I have other
uses in mind for it. If ye agree, I will send for Tanner. I'm interested
in getting help from him on how to fortify the place. Hopefully, he'll find
this location agreeable. If not, nothing is set in stone, pardon the pun.
We could just as easily move to a different location. I chose this spot because
it is out of they way, yet very near one of the main trade routes between
northern and southern Norrath. It's also partially surrounded by those pretty
daunting looking mountains there."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin paced through the area that was soon to be Winterborne Keep. He
walked over near her and the others, and leapt up onto one of the giant blocks
of stone near by. He shaded his eyes from the setting sun, and scanned the
whole area again. Finally, he looked at Sharhel. With in internal smile,
Balkin crouched down, and motioned her to come to him. With the haft of his
Executioners Axe over his knees, he spun the vicious double blade via the
haft, and watched as her eyes were drawn to the spinning blade. She walked
over nonchalantly, till there was less than 5 feet between them. Crouched
as he was on the block of stone, they were now eye to eye. He continued spinning
the double bladed axe, and with a hard glare, finally spoke.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"The inner keep be the seat o' the Winterborne. It also be our final defense,
if the outer walls ever be breached. I will nae trust the lives o' the house
on inferior work. If'n yer friend Tanner be an expert on fortification and
defense, then send fer him. Him an me friend can work out the specifics,
but I'll brook no nonsense from you on this. Ye have one chance; one evening
to change me mind. If ye can't do it, I leave in the morning. If I come back,
and construction has been started, me mates will take down what's up and
start over. Understand me?"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Shar let the disgruntled dwarf vent and reasoned that she probably should've
included him on her project sooner. "In for a copper, in for a platinum,
aye, Balkin?" The pale lady laughed and raised her hands to the others. "What
say the rest of ye?"</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The dark cleric smiled at the drifting clouds as she lay on the grassy
hill. In the background was the low lazy buzz of cicadas punctuated by the
frequent sounds of workers. The outer walls of the new fortress were all
laid in and hordes of laborers bustled about to shore up their formidable
heights. The inner walls and buildings were a little behind in completion
compared to the immense first defense. Zsalshun had accompanied Shar and
Balkin to the fortress a while back but had decided to keep out of the way.
The barbarian woman&#146;s skill in prodding workers to their best efforts
made the Tier&#146;Dal think of the merchants of her homeland. The white
woman took a dark glee in reprimanding those who slacked in her presence.
No further behind, although with entirely different methods for encouraging
the workers, Balkin hovered over the dwarven laborers checking their every
move. The priestess could offer nothing that the two weren&#146;t already
doing, so she opted to range the plains.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She had just come back from killing the treants that lived in the northwest
boundary of the land. Her dark god had finally granted her the right to spells
of the 24th level of accomplishment but the ones she hunted with were a waste
for her new talents. They were competent enough to stay mostly out of harms
way but they squibbled pettily amongst themselves and continually got into
trouble that they expected her to bail them out of. The priestess used them
to gain her spells then left them to their own devices. She cared not what
became of them, their names already fading from her memory.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Now she found herself lying on the gentle slope of the hills overlooking
the fortress in the distance. Even from here she could hear the cranky old
dwarf yelling at the stone workers for whatever flaw he had found now. Zsalshun
smiled and headed towards the source of the tirade. The workers were going
to kill Balkin before long and the grumpy warrior was probably not even that
upset with them. The priestess thought that both the workers and the warrior
would benefit if Balkin could work some of his pent up energy out on something
else.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Approaching from behind the dwarf she insolently leaned up against the
smoothed surface of stone. &#147;You want to spend the rest of the eve yelling
at the workers, dwarf, or would you rather let them do what they do and practice
doing what you do? It&#146;s about time to head up to Runneye if you are
still up to it.&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;BAH! We ain&#146;t got enough people to assault the temple
there!&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The warrior bristled as he critically eyed one of the masons. Zsalshun
could see that his presence had been tolerated up to this point but even
the most stoic of people can be pushed only so far, large 2 handed
Battleaxe&#146;s non-withstanding.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;So then, what shall we hunt? There has to be something here worth
while.&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The dwarf paused, a crinkle of distaste washing over his face as he thought
about hunting in the southern plains. &#147;Aye. IF we could find some gnolls
outside the entrance to Split Paw, that might work.&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Zsalshun nodded. &#147;I need to get some things from the fort. Shall
I meet you there then?&#148; Without waiting she walked into the gap that
would be the main gate.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin Eyed her back as she walked away. She had a way o&#146; getting
him riled up that wasn&#146;t even explainable. It wasn&#146;t dislike at
all, but she sure could rub him the wrong way. Or maybe it was that she knew
him to well eh? Shaking his head, he watched the dwarven stone workers placing
another perfectly hewn block of stone in place. They didn&#146;t need his
help, that was certain, but he was so antsy to get this done, he had been
riding them pretty hard. The outer walls of the Inner keep were coming along
fine, and he was tired o&#146; the inactivity anyway. With a twirl of his
axe, and a &#147;Harumph&#148; he spun on his heel and stalked off. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Grabbing his packs, he headed towards the gate. Another contingent of
dwarves was working on finalizing that as well. The huge iron banded doors
were complete, and would be hung in place in the next week. As he walked,
he could feel Sharhel&#146;s eyes on him. Looking up on the outer wall where
she stood, hands on hips, he pointed his axe up at her, then back at the
masons working on the inner keep. She knew what he wanted. No words were
necessary. With a burst energy, he ran full tilt out the gate and didn&#146;t
look back.</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Zsalshun jogged up to the place Balkin said he and some others were waiting.
She had to laugh when she discovered he had found another warrior with similar
prowess as his own, a ranger and a paladin not too far behind the two warriors.
The dwarf was in a blood letting mood and had assembled a formidable team
for just that purpose. Swords would flash and limbs would fly and Zsalshun
was there to ensure that only gnoll limbs were the ones that remained unattached
and leaking on the sun soaked ground.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The warriors waded in and easily dispatched gnoll after gnoll. The ground
turned red from their victories and still they clamored for more. The ranger
ran the width of the southern plains, bringing in all sorts of creatures
for the group to wet their blades on. At one point in time Zsalshun looked
up startled from her studies as the ground shook and a monstrous Cyclopes
lumbered up to the bevy of warriors. With little help from her god the four
whittled at the giant until it collapsed. Balkin let out a triumphant war
whoop and urged the ranger to find another.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The night went on merrily as foe after foe fell to the blood lust of the
fighters. Eventually the paladin declared that he had things to attend to
in his temple and bid farewell to the group. Zsalshun sat down to reclaim
the mana that greater heal depleted so quickly and was startled to hear the
ranger talking to a wandering druid named Xantherax. The priestess looked
up from her book at the fuzzy muzzle of a wolf.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;Would that be you, old friend?&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The dog grinned and lolled his tongue. Somewhere in her mind she heard
the greeting thoughts of the druid she had not seen in months. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;You might ask Balkin to join if you want. A druid would be a
boon.&#148; The priestess smiled wickedly, &#147;Besides, then you could
take over half of the buffing spells.&#148; Her new healing spell plus the
standard buffs were straining her mana. The druid would ease the outward
flow of the precious energy.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin roared a greeting and invited the wayward druid into the foray.
</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin&#146;s grin could only be called vicious, as he landed another
critical blow, Axe biting deeply into the side of his latest victim. The
addition of Xantherax to their ranks merely heightened the intense rush of
emotion, both pleasure and pain that he felt at the time. It had been many
months since the druid had been seen in the lands. Feeling the healing magic
of Zsalshun wash over him again, Balkin finished off his current victim,
and looked around quickly for another. To late, the other Gnoll was falling
to the blades of his current companions. Turning back to the body of the
Gnoll at his feet, Balkin took what little coin it had, kicked it once to
make sure it was dead, and left the body to rot. The damnable gnolls deserved
nothing else.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Taking a moment to rest, no enemies being in sight, Balkin removed his
armored mask and helm, used one hand to wipe the blood off them. Even with
that protection, he could still feel where the blood had worked it&#146;s
way down under his armor, drying there, mixing with his sweat. Nothing like
the smell of armored, sweaty, bloody dwarf. He replaced his armor, and prepared
for the next round. The gnolls were nothing, if not persistent. Another 2
or threesome of scouts would be leaving the lair soon. Just in time to die.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He had to admit, as he spotted the next scouting party leaving the lair,
that Zsalshun had been right. He needed this more than he needed to oversee
those masons. THIS was what he lived for. THIS was who and what he was. Leaning
his axe against his side, he pulled his bow off his shoulder and quickly
knocked an arrow. Someone needed to get the attention of this group eh? Might
as well be him. The arrow sank into the thigh of the lead gnoll, who turned,
and charged the dwarf, and his companions. Slinging his bow, Balkin grabbed
his axe, and backed up to the middle of the skirmish line. He would bear
the brunt of the assault, but that was nothing new. Wish a vicious swipe
of his axe, battle was joined again.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Zsalshun watched, as the mighty dwarf unleashing his full fury on the
hapless gnolls. His growl turned into a battle roar, as he let loose his
control, allowing the rage within to boil outward. These foul gnolls were
already dead, they just didn&#146;t know it yet. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He had been holding back, not letting himself go for some time, though
he knew he had to. She would let him rage for a time, then heal him, and
cast her soothing magics on him, bringing him back from the brink of rage
and madness. A good fight was one thing, but he had to release his rage,
or it would consume him. Though they had never talked about it, she understood
that he placed his mind and sanity in her hands at times like this. Very
few warriors were blessed, or cursed, depending on how you looked at it,
with true battle rage. For better or worse, Balkin had it.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She watched, as the battle raged, almost continually. Timing her healing
spells so that she would not anger the gnolls any more than necessary. The
others stayed a step or two away from Balkin, even between battles. He was
in his own world now, not even acknowledging her healing, or Xantherax&#146;s
buffing spells. Just stood there, growling and breathing hard, waiting for
the next kill. Finally, after countless battles, it was enough. His body
was growing weary and he might fall unconscious soon.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She stood from her meditations, and nodded to the other fighters nearby.
They understood, backing away a few paces. Concentrating, she healed the
bloody dwarf again, and immediately followed that spell with a mind lulling,
gentle spell, trying to force a calm upon his raging heart. What happened
next always unnerved the dark priestess and made her cringe back on the inside
despite standing her ground. Balkin&#146;s head whipped around, and he took
several steps towards her, axe raised as if he would attack. What she could
see of his eyes past the Grotesque Mask he wore seemed to drain of rage and
pain. He halted, and lowered his axe, breathing like a bellows, and obviously
near exhaustion. Zsalshun nodded slightly, whether to the dwarf, herself
or her Dark god she wasn&#146;t sure but once again the warrior had come
back from his rage without impaling her upon his axe.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin looked around, planting the blades of his axe on the ground, and
leaning on the haft. He was so tired he could hardly focus on the events
at hand. Unhinging the mask from his face with one hand, he stared hard at
the dark elf, just a few steps away. She nodded, and glanced at the others
behind him. With a sigh, he turned, and looked up at the others, at the same
time, noting the bodies around him. The carnage was actually rather shocking.
Xantherax was still there, so were the Ranger and Warrior he had started
the night with. The paladin was gone, to his temple Zsalshun whispered into
his mind. &#147;I must go my friends&#148; He removed his gauntlets, and
grasped forearms with the ranger, and then with the tall human warrior, who
nodded seriously, recognizing what had occurred this day and night. Then
he turned to Xantherax. &#147;It&#146;s been some time my friend, next time,
don&#146;t be gone so long.&#148; The druid nodded and smiled, as he to grasped
hand and forearm with the dwarf. &#147;It won&#146;t be so long again my
friend,&#148; said the druid, as he blessed all with spirit of the wolf.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;Zsalshun, run with me?&#148; asked the dwarf. She nodded, as the
group split up, each heading their own way. Though he was far to weary to
run, he would manage for a time, she knew. Perhaps he would even be stubborn
enough to make it back to the keep. With a mental shrug, she ran along side
his armored form. Glancing out of the corner of her eye, she saw his forehead
beetle down into an intense frown. Yes, he would be stubborn enough. He would
sleep when they got to the keep, probably through the next day and night
as well, and she would watch over him until she knew he was out of danger.
</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The waif of battle stench drifted over to her as they ran and she briefly
wondered how difficult it was going to be to coax the warrior to bathe before
he slept into oblivion for the next couple of days. The priestess knew full
well it would be a monumental task but one the workers, herself and anyone
who passed within a stone&#146;s throw of his quarters would greatly appreciate.
Shaking her head, she settled into an easy lope, pacing the dwarf, and ran
into the night.</I>
