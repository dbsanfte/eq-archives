<I>Strangely, as Malozc tried to fit in, he only seemed to make new enemies.
The time spent in Highhold in particular confused him. He helped fight the
hoards of orcs and gnolls that punished the citizens and guards of this place,
yet, something seemed unclear. The thoughts would continually come back that
something was not right. IT was then, after a night of mastering brewing,
and falling asleep on the Inn's dock that he found out why.<BR>
<BR>
The morning was bright and the sun stung his sensitive eyes. As he rolled
over to block the light, he fell off the dock and into the cold water of
the pass.<BR>
<BR>
Screaming aloud in the water's medium he was suddenly lost of which way was
up, excitedly he swam for an opening that promised air. As he found that
air he realized this was not the same view he'd left.<BR>
<BR>
The walls rose and created echoes as the water dripped from his robes. He
spied someone coming and tried to hail him but found himself stopping. The
man had a dusty appearance, a sinister look that Malozc instantly took for
aggressive. Quickly he summoned the shadows and hid himself. He looked down
at the water pool beneath his feet and cursed silently. Slowly he crouched
down and held his breath. The man came to the waters edge and reached to
ground as if to listen. The man waited and listened. Just as if he might
discover Malozc, another man, much like himself smacked him back, "What's
the matter? Life of the smuggler gotcha jumpy!" His cohort laughed. "Nae,
just a feeling." Quit worrying. Ye know we've got the guards in our pockets,
now come back to camp, we've just gotten a pottery wheel in, a complete set
of equipment so that we can master any skill we wish!"<BR>
<BR>
'Aye, I suppose you're right. Let's go"<BR>
<BR>
Malozc let go a painfully held breath. "Baaasssstards! I help you by fighting
the scourge of orcs and gnolls and ye are simply a front! His voice carried
more than he had intended and the echo brought foot steps from the pass.
Quickly he dove into the pool and retired to the inn. The thoughts of being
played for a fool were too much. There would be revenge. There would be
restitution and oh yes . . . there would be death. </I>

<I>"Perched upon the rock, I could see the guards going about their daily
chores. Protecting the innocents, I presumed was their guise. The water trickled
by me innocently, as I gathered what little bit of it I could, to keep myself
provisioned. The druid Kimber had provided me with foraged goods for a small
time and the water from here should keep me for some time. What am I to do?
Perhaps I could glean from Shiver, the mentor of my dark powers, what he
would do? Perhaps I should involve even Olam's power at this juncture? No.
Not Olam. He would think I have stooped to the lows of blanket evil. He would
nae understand the meaning of murder for a cause. No, just Shiver at this
point.<BR>
[He withdraw a blank parchment and quill and began]<BR>
<BR>
"Shiver Hel Despana,<BR>
<BR>
The discoveries I pen to you this day are of mine own observations and not
words retold. <BR>
<BR>
The smugglers of High Hold are an outright extension of the guards' corruption.
The organization that "protects" Highhold pass has nothing but ill planned
for those of honor and, as I understand Vox's missive to me, a direct catalyst
of the coming plague. <BR>
<BR>
It is, then, with heavy heart and tired hand, that I send this letter to
you. I plan murder, under the guise of justice. For the corruption that I
see here, I can no longer idly watch. No . . . I must take action. Already
I have dispatched half a score of the smugglers. Sure to my belief, as I
brought their heads to the guards of Highhold, they attacked me. It was only
by sure will power that I was able to rejoin my body and start my mission
once again. Please . . . please send help.<BR>
<BR>
Child of the darkness,<BR>
<BR>
Malozc"<BR>
<BR>
[The letter rolled up crisply and summoning a servant from the bones he had
stored, he bid him deliver the message to Shiver].<BR>
<BR>
"Surely there is something that Winterborne could do? So many had already
sold out to the corruption, surely one, perhaps two would stand up to it?
This is our missive from Vox, is it not? I cannot stand by . . . I will not.
No, this shall either be my lonely crusade or the fight of life for Winterborne
as a whole! </I>

<I>The hate welled up inside and sent a tremor of anger through the
Teir&#146;dal. "This is what it is to be a dark elf," he thought, then corrected
himself; "This is what it is to be a dragon denied his true form, his birthright
of power." And yet, it was more. The shaking in his hands, the rage that
surged through his frail form&#133; it came from a place so deep, the necromancer
couldn&#146;t begin to fathom the extent of the sensation. He crouched within
the secret entrance to the aqueducts outside the gates of Qeynos, unseen
and safe from the human guards, but his mind seethed with visions of vengeance.
He had long forgotten the extent of the crimes committed against him. He
was consumed with the urge to steal the life from the sheep that swarmed
the lands around him, oblivious.<BR>
<BR>
The citizens of Qeynos would not let him enter the room he had rented in
his dark elven guise. He would be stripped of his valuables and thrown from
the gates if caught within the walls of the city. Such was the gratitude
he had earned? How many gnolls had been dispatched with a swift strike from
his staff? How many bandits had been consumed in a wave of flame, a swarm
of stinging insects? They didn&#146;t understand the magic of form change,
only illusions. Shivrehel Despana, Teir&#146;dal Necromancer, was branded
a Heretic in Neriak, and an outcast in the lands of light. He had to forge
a new reputation, his accomplishments as the servant of Karana limited to
his life as a human. <BR>
<BR>
Amorsaylnn, at the request of her father, had offered to assist Shiver. She
was capable of destroying entire camps of the bandits in the Karanas. She
would weave an enchantment of invisibility over him and announce to the residents
of Qeynos that the two Teir&#146;dal were off to deal with the brigand menace.
The guards scoffed, though not loudly. She had brought proof of forty-one
dead bandits in one evening alone. They scoffed because Shivrehel was clearly
new to the world, though his equipment and company spoke otherwise. How they
could sense his weakness, Shiver did not know. He knew that it would be remedied
in time&#133; and they would come to fear his name.<BR>
<BR>
"And this too, shall pass." The words bloomed in his mind, surfing the white-caps
of his rancor. Revenge! He longed for the day Lady Vox would bow to him and
Innoruuk&#133; the Lord of Hate would bleed at Shiver&#146;s feet, broken
by the power he had given all Teir&#146;dal.<BR>
<BR>
He rose, clenching the Staff of Writhing tightly in gloves infused with the
power of darkness. He knew his appearance impressed the young warriors venturing
near the eastern walls of the Qeynos region. The brilliant white gossamer
robe, dark cloak imbued with the power of necromancy, silver rings set with
jade, and bracers forged in electrum and set with matching jade, a bat-fang
headband, and the skull of a gnoll shaman held in his other hand&#133; he
was adorned in equipment far beyond his minimal training, gained over twenty
years ago. They were gifts&#133; from Erondis, Olam, Morphite, and his own
work as a human. He would not begin his adventures with a training robe and
dagger this time.<BR>
<BR>
He heard gutteral shouts near his hiding spot, the foul tongue of a gnoll.
Stepping forth, he turned to face the squat dog-like creature, focused the
anima about him, and pulled the very life from the gnoll into his body. It
raced towards him, the swirls of malevolent magic trailing. He swung the
skull-topped staff&#151;a gift from Olam&#151;and the gnoll fell, silent
at his feet. <BR>
<BR>
"Citzens of Qeynos&#133;" he whispered. "Soon ye will welcome dr&#146;Shivrehel
Despana into thy fair city. Soon ye will embrace a name that will change
thy precious Norrath forever."</I>

<I>Most of what occurred in the world occurred while he was away. The skies
turned bright, the skies turned dark. It didn't matter if he was present
or not . . . time continued pass and events occurred. Young warriors became
skilled in the way of the land and surpassed his present prowess. How sad.
The world didn't revolve around him. He chuckled. A half-hearted chuckle
that only mildly disguised his distaste for the situation. Often he moved
from one land to the next . . . surveying, watching, slaying. This was Olam
Wyrmsoul, he'd wanted a reputation for power, but to get that power he needed
to accept this world for what it was, not fight it . . . not hide from it
. . . oh, he so wanted to hide from the deceit and foolishness that ran rampant.
But he couldn't. It was present, and it was time to stand. "So be it," he
mumbled and arose from his perch overlooking the lava soaked plains of the
land known as Lavastorm.<BR>
<BR>
A bird of fire flew close to his head but did not pay attention to him, just
merely floated by on the waves of heat rising from the ground. Olam sipped
from his nearly depleated reserves -- water had become scarce and his days
of foraging in Kelethin had not taught him enough to find water in this
environment. The caves of Solusek lay below him now. Their openings almost
clouded by the steam whisps that arose from the lake of fire below. "Tempting
. . ." Olam mused, as he imagined a martyr's leap into the pool, "but no."
He made his way to the upper cavern's opening. "Here . . . this will do for
now."<BR>
<BR>
He leaned hard against the hot granite of the hill side. The heat made travel
difficult and his chain itched, despite his cloth undershirt. His eyes rolled
back into his head and he sighed. He focused on his life before . . . the
times in the Aerie and the times that he used to enjoy with his vassals.
It was then, in the reflection of his past, that he felt the power that was
familiar to him. "Shiver?" he half-whispered aloud. Again, the wave went
through him. He could feel it's power but it was faint . . . barely
distinguishable from the myriad of cross-talk he'd received from this plane.
Each time the familar feeling passed through him and he smiled a faint smile,
"Ah then, old friend . . . you've arrived and are already using my gift.
It is well!" <BR>
<BR>
Olam arose to his feet. He looked at the cave's opening and smiled as he
entered it's depths . . .</I>

<I>To Malozc:<BR>
<BR>
"Brother in Darkness,<BR>
<BR>
It is good to see ye moving against that which is an abomination t&#146;
our kind. Ye would have made a fitting dragon of my order on the Isles. I
shall alert the others o&#146; the House of the danger and request they move
t&#146; assist thee. I am slowly adapting t&#146; this plane and my powers
are quite meager, but I shall endeavor to gather the strength need t&#146;
oppose this disease in High Pass. I understand the virtue of compassion and
justice, but nae this petty greed. They are the vermin of Norrath and should
be gifted with the darkness by our will."</I>

<I>Days had gone by slowly for Malozc. The incestuous power of the smugglers
he had underestimated. They were entrenched more than he imagined and it
was too much for he and his incantation alone. Even the power Innoruuk provided
through his pets were no match . . . indeed, something that Vox had told
him he was being set up for . . . that is, the eventual realization that
Innoruuk was not a God to be worshiped so much as used.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, the dark caster had relegated himself to the plains of Karana to watch
the peoples and learn their ways. He slew that which others slew, he fought
and sold himself to their ways. All was good? "This disgusts me. I grow tired
of the norm. I seek that which was bid me to do!" His words called out more
loudly then he intended. The water that ran under the wooden bridge seemed
to stops its incessant wailing at his call. Just then he heard a pebble roll
by him. Quickly he swung his flail, the mighty Harvester, at the attacker's
head . . . unfortunately it was only by mere balance that he didn't fall
on his ass. The would-be melee'r missed the target . . . a small boy with
parchment, by many feet. The boy stood there, pale, and sweating. He mumbled
something akin to "I've GOT to get another line of work" as he offered Malozc
the scroll he held. "Please sir, I mean no harm and I bring nothing more
than a message from Dirge."<BR>
<BR>
Malozc snickered. "Ye bring no harm, but yet you bring a missive from Dirge?"
The boy looked confused. Malozc shook his head, "I nae expect you to understand
that.<BR>
<BR>
Malozc took the scroll and read it over. A brief look of despair crossed
his face and he nodded. Quickly he scribed a letter in
response.<BR>
<BR>
Here," he hands the boy a scroll. "be a good lad and take this to the man."
The boy smiled. Malozc looked at him and knelt down. Leaning on his scythe
he whispered in the boy's ear, "Should you fail, your head will be a rotting
nest for maggots, and your body my newest pet!" The boy's smile quickly faded
as he backed away so quickly he fell. Scrambling up the hillside, the dust
of his departure hiding his feet, the boy ran West towards Qeynos.</I>
