<I>Erondis felt this odd tingling and itching feeling as he walked through
the woods new to him. He had little time to start to adjust to the world
of Solon before this very distracting tingle started. Then it grew into an
itch, an itch that seemed to be inside of him. It lasted for nearly thirty
seconds, then a great life came to Erondis&#146;s eyes and he
vanished.<BR>
<BR>
Erondis awoke to find himself lying near a fountain of a well done marble
temple. He arose slowly, brushing off his robes. It seemed as if the few
people around didn&#146;t take any note of him at all. Quickly it dawned
on him that the first time of hi being unstuck between Norrath and Solon
must of occurred. This must be Norrath.<BR>
<BR>
Erondis looked about, trying to get his bearings and remember what he had
learned of the cities in his past. &#147;Grand structures, large amount of
stone, everyone in robes&#133;. This would most likely be Erudin. I could
not have ended up within a better place I think.&#148; He quickly decided
on his guise in this world to be that of an enchanter. He had skills with
enchanting of gems and scrolls back within the tower of scrying, they would
come in very useful to this new world. He also knew the conclave existed
here and was devoid of an enchanter in their midst, so he would be able to
cover their needs. <BR>
<BR>
The enchanter quickly tried one of his old spells to shift himself but found
it beyond his abilities. &#147;It would seem the magic is different here.
I shall need to learn again.&#148; He said aloud, getting a few odd glances
from people passing by. <BR>
<BR>
Next Erondis decided he would do best to choose a deity or two from this
world to follow in order that he might be more accepted by the locals and
easier to fit in. Past studies had revealed to him that Quellious would be
the best choice for him, as their ideals of peace, balance, and seeking inner
knowledge nearly paralleled his own. Then he also chose to follow Veeshan.
His natural ability to understand and speak the tongue of dragons of all
worlds was the deciding factor of this. Should he ever meet one of this world,
he wished to be prepared. Also he was sure it would rub better with the Conclave
of the Wyrm. <BR>
<BR>
Erondis, having made his choice ascended the stairs from the fountain to
a sparkling gem above. He slowly stepped upon it to find his way to the palace
of Erudin, and his teachers for enchantment. </I>

<I>Realizing some of the most important enchantments needed for jewelry were
found only in his native town of Neriak, Kazzander began to question the
vendors as to where he could find spells that would enchant silver and electrum
for use in making magical jewelry... He searched thru the foreign quarter
high and low but it was not to be found.. Rumors were around that they were
to be found in the infamous third gate where no invasion had ever reached.
In in one of the guild halls, Kazzander found what he was looking for and
prceeded to contact Erondis to arrange a meet in a neutral locale. Settling
upon Highpass in the center of the world, the time of the meeting was agreed
upon. The trip was long and arduous... Kodiak bears, Cutthroat bandits and
orcs all tried to impede his progress. On the brink of starvation, he found
Erondis waiting at the entrance to Highpass. Exchanging food and water for
the scrolls, a look of glee crossed Erondis' face as Kazzander quickly ran
off into the dark before one of his kin would question him for giving away
the secrets of the dark elf enchanters...</I>
