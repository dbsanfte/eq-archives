<I>The huge, curved talon came out of nowhere to pierce her flesh, leaving
her dangling from its tip like a tidbit of skewered meat, plucked from a
plate for a snack. The blood haze of pain that raced through her body denied
movement, thinking, or any scream that could pass her suddenly cold and bloodless
lips. In an instant however, it was gone, leaving her shaking, trembling,
crying, and knowing, beyond doubt, beyond hope that she was somewhere she
did not want to be. Blood dripped from her face and body in a slow but steady
cadence, freezing into tiny, glittering gems on the snow-covered ground she
now found herself kneeling on. Face down, hunched and bleeding, she struggled
to rise, to speak, to scream again and again, to use some of the power she
felt within her to save herself from this cold and lifeless place. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>There was a presence here, a massive, oppressive thing, filled with amusement
at her plight and yet a sadness that this must be done. No word, no sound
proceeded it, but the magic gripped her with sudden force and held her, frozen
and chilled of skin, immobile as the blocks of ice she could sense close
by. She could do nothing as the presence swelled within her mind, rummaging
within her thoughts, seeking something there. It found what it was looking
for&#133;. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I> In an endless instant it tore through the haze in her mind, crashed through
the walls that hid her soul, and laid it bare before its solemn gaze. The
holding magic broke with the voice that suddenly spoke in a soft and yet
weighty tone. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I> "You will do&#133;yes, oh yes my lost child&#133;you will do." </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Raising eyes still blurred with tears and blood, she looked up and around,
seeking the speaker. Instead she found a small, barren cavern of ice. A soft
cascade of snow blew inside; whirling in an endless dance with the moonlight
that shone inside. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I> "I am Vox. I have sought you for many years now child. The end of this
world is coming just as sure as the end of your other lives. I need you here
to save it. Only those that have lost before are worthy to lose again. The
purity of your will is all that will save us now. You are bound here, in
the magic's of this world and the hopelessness of its forms to save it."
</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Her voice cracked as she questioned her fate." I do not want this! I do
not even know who I am!" Her voice raised in volume as she continued "Who
are you to bring me here! To save this world I want no part of and don't
even know? I only crave peace for my soul, such as it is and I cannot even
know that!" Raising her head in defiance she struggled to lift herself off
the floor and stand. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I> "You are one of the few and you shall not deny it! Behold that which
you are and were and will be again!" </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I> The sudden shifting of the earth caused her to fall. Shapes began to
form in the snow before her. Things and people long gone, that she did not
even know she had missed, flashed before her startled eyes. They twisted
and flickered in ever increasing speed as she began to weep and finally,
after so many years understand&#133;."Oh Gods! No more!" her plaintive cry
was swallowed in the twisting storm of images. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I> "You are what you are, and you will be one of them again, Lost One. I
demand this of you as you demand it of yourself. You are now winterborne.
You will find the others in time and know them by my mark, just as they will
know you. Though their faces have changed, the souls remain the same, and
you will know&#133;" </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I> "You shall be known henceforth as Trespare, the lost one, for the
thrice-damned soul that has made you what you are. Go forth lost one, and
start anew." </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I> In the eternity of an instant she found herself, whole and warm and
wondering, underneath a bustling town held aloft in the trees. Reaching up
to soothe back her hair and wipe the tears from her eyes, she sighed. So
much lost and so little gained&#133;.what price for her soul this time? </I>
