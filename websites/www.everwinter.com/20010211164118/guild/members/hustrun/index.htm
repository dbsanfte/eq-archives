	      <I> After over two years, I've finally made it back to Kaladim.</I>
	      <P ALIGN=Left>
	      <I>After exchanging pleasantries with the guards at the enterance to the
	      city, I venture forth into the caves. Familiar faces of city guards and royal
	      bodyguards greet me in Southern Kaladim. Ah, there it is...Kal's Pub...I
	      remember spending many a late night in that place. Outside Kal's, I notice
	      my friend Kilam, the bard, trying to talk some young dwarf warrior into
	      delivering a package half way across Norrath for him. I listen with a smirk
	      on my face, as I hear him deliver the same pitch he hooked me with many years
	      ago. As the youngster carries the package off, I whisper, "Got another one
	      on the list, heh Kilam?" We laugh about the private joke that the bards have
	      been pulling on young adventurers for years, the joke that Kilam let slip
	      one night after having an ale too many. The important letters that need to
	      be delivered all around Norrath are simply a list of the names of all the
	      people that the bards could sucker into carrying them!</I></TD>

	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Bards with a sense of humor, who knew!</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Kilam offers to buy the first round at Kal's, and says he'd like to hear
	about my journeys. I know that I should really report in to Gunlok Jure about
	my travels, but it's been a long trip from the docks, my shield arm is acting
	up again and a Dwarven ale would go down real smooth right about now. I also
	recall the words of my good friend Brombeard Brewmeister, that an ale or
	two, purely for medicinal purposes, mind you, is the best tonic of all. And
	Kilam is buying...</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Five hours, and many ales later... "Hustrun Vallahir, reporting in sir,"
	I say after standing at attention and saluting Master Jure. I struggle to
	stay awake, let alone at attention, as Gunlok Jure takes his time acknowledging
	me, half-heartedly shuffling through the piles of paperwork on his desk.
	After what seems an eternity, during which I have repeatedly cursed Brombeard
	and his cure all tonics, Master Jure looks up at me and says, "At ease."</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I reach down to my backpack and fumble through it, looking for the log
	of my adventures. "There's time enough for that, Hustrun. Follow me." Master
	Jure says, as he walks out of his office. I follow, expecting the
	enevitable...</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Whenever I had erred in an assignment or misson in my youth, Master Jure
	would escourt me to the warriors arena in South Kaladim and "teach" me some
	advanced fighting techniques to improve my chances of surviving in the wilds
	of Norrath. I'd always end up bruised and battered, eating the arena dirt,
	after every one of those "lessons".</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Expecting more of the same, I was surprised when he turned towards the
	temple of Brell, instead of towards the bank, and South Kaladim. He stopped
	at the door and simply ordered me, "Enter." </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>The two brass door opened before me. Two robed acolytes stood before me,
	looked at me as I walked through the doorway, then turned and slowly walked
	towards the main temple hall. As I followed, the smell of incense was overwhelmed
	my sences. That, coupled with the dim light radiating from the dozen or so
	candles in the hall and my earlier consumption of "Brell's finest" at Kal's,
	I battled to remain awake and on my feet. Before me, upon the dias, was the
	High Priestess of Brell, Ghalea. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>She commanded me. "Kneel." </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>And upon my doing so, the priestess presented me with a silver goblet,
	saying,"Drink from this, the Chalace of Conquest, given to us by Brell's
	own hand. Know now what holy mission he demands of you!"</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Slowly, with great reverance, I accepted the chalace and drank of it's
	contents. Ale!</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>It was difficult to surpress a smile. Never before had I drank it's like,
	and I probably never would again...at least not in this lifetime. As I savoured
	the holy drink, the High Priestess again spoke, softly this time, "Meditate
	now, young Paladin. And learn..."</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I remained kneeling and closed my eyes.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Pictures of people flashed before my eyes...</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Brombeard, Artes, Meer, Jerhan, Balkan, Zsalshun,...dozens of others that
	I have never met. These faces fade...</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I see the sky...an overcast sky.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>From behind a cloud appears a majestic creature...a dragon!With scales
	of ivory, circling overhead.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>She suddenly disappears into the clouds from which she came. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>The clouds then move, violently, through the sky...</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>A form takes shape from the very clouds themselves...</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>A Dwarf...</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>BRELL!!</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"These are your allies, your friends and they shall protect and aid you,
	as you shall protect and aid them. Together you shall discover the means
	to rid this land of the evil that infests, corrupts and destroys. This is
	your quest. This is my will."</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I feel the cold stone of the temple floor as I awake.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I look around me, there are no priests or acolytes, no candles lit, no
	incense burning...</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I lift myself from the stone floor and walk towards the closed temple
	doors. Before them, I see my weapons, armor, backpack...I understand.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Walking through South Kaladim, I turn to see Kal's pub, and spy Kilam
	entering. "No, not today...," I say to myself aloud, continuing towards the
	city gates, "I have work to do."</I>
