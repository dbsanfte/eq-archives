<I>Rianna bent down to re-adjust one of her legging ties and felt the soft
thud as her pack swung forward and pressed her down, overbalancing her yet
again and causing her to fall forward, with her forehead in the grass.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"God Damn IT! Can't I do a thing without coming across as an ungraceful
ingrate?" The last few months had been difficult. Rianna found herself more
and more depressed as the days wore on.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Bad enough to have to get used to this body, have to take it from someone
else, then I have to deal with it's damn imperfections," She thought. "Not
that I'm not 'grateful' mind ye, but I'll have the last say in this ye bitch
Vox!"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Sighing deeply, Rianna sat down to contemplate the last few chaotic days,
and to find the source of her deepening sorrow.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>It all started out with that damn Knight Amabala. He had been chasing
her for months now it seemed. She could see that look in his eyes every time
he looked at her. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"But I'm not HER!" she muttered. "I may look like her, but I'm not, and
I know ye know the difference." All the travel in the last few months, and
the constant working at her desk had finally given way to her need to be
out, and she had ventured beyond the lands she normally frequented. The last
rays of summer were rolling by and it was a good time to get out and get
clear air before the days shortened and the nights became cold enough to
chill bones.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Sure enough, Knight Ama had rushed to her yet again, and had then shocked
her with his question.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Will you marry me Queen Rianna? Please?" he had said in her mind that
night she ventured out.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>What do ye say to that? Sighing deeply, she had told him to come meet
with her so they could talk. Twould be nice if she could actually not be
alone for once. After their meeting however, it seemed she would be. They
had argued about duty and learning. Philosophical discussions were always
one of her strong points, but sadly, the Knight was not up to the
challenge.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"He is human, I suppose, and too easily led astray by his peers and the
needs of his body. They grow old too fast, and fear they must amass as much
power as they can before they die. When ye are as old as I am, ye realize
that ye don't need to do that. Ye enjoy the traveling simply for the landscape,
not just for the learning or profit it may give ye." She muttered to
herself.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Bowing her head before the rising sun, Rianna sent forth a silent prayer
to the Celestial one who ruled her heart.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Lord, Most Traveled One, Blessed of the Stars, I pray for Knight Amabala's
peace, and I pray too that I will not be alone for all of my days. I pray
that ye ease my own loneliness and forgive my questioning soul. Tis a hard
path ye lay out before me. I shall walk it as yer servant, and keep my faith
until the end of thy path for me. I pray ye give me the strength to learn
and grow in myself and to take pleasure from others doing so. I pray also
that ye bless Winterborne and all those who make this journey with me. Give
me thy blessings Most Traveled One."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Rianna placed her pack back in its proper place and picked up her weapons.
Turning to face the brilliant setting sun, she started down the beaten path,
once more alone.</I>
