<I>The dark elf sneered, dropped to one knee, and removed the bottle of Kalish
the small gnoll had been carrying. It was an easy kill and he had grown used
to expecting nothing beyond their scalps. His natural inclination would be
to sell the bottle to Sneed, but the merchant had conveniently forgotten
Shiver&#146;s alternate identity, despite immutable proof. It didn&#146;t
really matter. The guards would never allow him to slip through the gates
of North Qeynos, anyway. Given his options and his already stuffed backpacks,
he uncorked the bottle with his teeth, spit the cork into the long grass
outside the city, and drank the fruit-wine in entirety.<BR>
<BR>
His tolerance to spirits had been lost with the Orb Winter. His mind clouded
immediately, but staying away from the guards was all he had to concern himself
with. The gnolls were no threat. Only the Queen Klicknik would pose an issue,
and she was easily eluded. Queen indeed&#151;<BR>
<BR>
The image burst into his mind, an uninvited visitor: the hardened, noble
eyes and a slight smile. Mischief incarnate, he thought. He knew the face
of that impish lady intimately, and imagined her each day&#151;often when
he chose to enter his reverie. They say the elven people need no sleep, because
they meditate and dream of their lives, becoming innately confident of their
own identity. The drow had no such practice. They didn&#146;t care to know
the depths of their own depravity, the shallow and hopeless sum of their
days. Shiver, on the other hand, had learned from House Neirdre, and found
the reflection addictive.<BR>
<BR>
No fond recall of days past danced in his mind. He remembered pain, reliving
the agony of each broken vow and betrayed comrade. Then again, he knew it
didn&#146;t matter in the end. He was defiance given form. He would choose
the hardest path, no matter what opposed him and how lucrative the outcome
of the alternative. Some believed him wise, having seen so much, but the
dark elf knew himself better than that. He had the instinct for survival,
memory and reason that facilitated his long years&#133; but every day was
suffering. Today was no exception, as he tried to steady his feet and concentrate
on the objective. <BR>
<BR>
Two hundred dead gnolls would force them to tolerate his life within the
walls of Qeynos, at least most of them. The bounty for three hundred of their
slain foes would see the merchants opening their stores to him. Others were
not so kind, and no guard&#151;corrupt or not&#151;would cite them with a
violation. The mages&#146; guilds, the bards who claimed to follow Veeshan,
and most obviously the temples of Karana and Tunare&#133; all were sworn
foes of the power of necromancy, though Shiver would have been the last to
drawn his power from Innorruk.<BR>
<BR>
Such was the tedium of his life as a dark elf, but he was conformable in
the form. Unlike his dragon brethren, he actually preferred the seeming,
though by no means had he wanted to give up his true nature. No doubt Olam,
Saidar, and perhaps some of the others suffered more than the deep. He
didn&#146;t wish the discomfort upon them, but dragon&#146;s had grown very
arrogant and relied far too heavily on the gift of claw, fang, wing, and
breath. Shiver had never taken that for granted, and his many duels in the
arena of Triboar, or the Lost Hills and Neverwinter Woods were also done
in his dark elven guise. <BR>
<BR>
But Norrath was different. Frail and seething, he had the grace of the
Teir&#146;dal, as they called the dark elves of the land, but so too was
he weak and easily winded. That was something he missed about the human form,
but it was difficult for him to tolerate it for long periods of time. He
doubted even his fellows within Winterborne understood how deeply his hatred
for servitude ran. Like it or not, being called druid required many sacrifices.
It was easier to move about, but he did so with a shackle about his neck.
Slavery to the discrimination of humanity&#133; slavery to the Lord of
Thunder&#133; even if the end result would be his victory, it was too easy
a path.<BR>
<BR>
He made his way through the darkness with the ease dark elven sight allowed.
His human form was nearly blind in similar conditions, though the mists affected
all. He proceeded dangerously close to the gates, then found the illusionary
wall, the entrance to the aqueducts of Qeynos. He slipped through the vines,
ignoring the illusion.<BR>
<BR>
The place was empty aside from a well. He knew that a short swim would lead
to the underworld of this land, but he wasn&#146;t ready. They didn&#146;t
like him there, either, and a defeat would be too costly at this juncture.
A week in the future, perhaps, things would be different, and he would begin
to explore. He knew of a temple dedicated to the Plague Bringer where he
hoped he would be welcome to train. They saw him as a dark elf, and that
was supposedly enough. But that was a plan, not the moment.<BR>
<BR>
He sat down, leaning the skull-topped Staff of Writhing against the wall,
over his shoulder. The fire of vengeance within him had waned for the eve.
He closed his eyes, allowing the reverie to fully claim him.</I>

<I>The gaunt Erudite he knew as Erondis sat before him, cloaked in intricate
black robes and mage&#146;s mail, immaculate in the rented office. The air
of nobility died as Shiver looked to the man&#146;s eyes, open wide with
distress and fear. Shiver stepped towards him, and he jerked abruptly backwards
like an trapped animal. A feral screech erupted between bared teeth. "Little
Erondi wants his auntttteeeeee!" and Erondis&#151;sage and
enchanter&#151;dissolved into the form of a panicked infant. He shrieked
as the tears streamed down his face, clenched his tiny fists, and began to
turn purple under the strain.<BR>
<BR>
Shiver narrowed his eyes, contemplating the situation. He needed the
man&#151;boy&#151;alive, yet he was certain he could not care for the changed
Erondis. "Daharil, come!"<BR>
<BR>
The door to his private suite opened and out stepped the lanky form of his
daughter, Shar, clad in bloodstained mail. There was a mad gleam in her eyes,
the look a drunk has when he&#146;s thwarted from drink. It was not unlike
the glare of bantam Erondis, but feral and twisted. She grinned, showing
pointed teeth and pulled a wide-bladed dagger from her belt. "Yah want me
shut up the little thing?"<BR>
<BR>
Shiver was never one to let surprise slow his actions, but there was a thick
fog upon his mind, slowing his reflexes. He reached for the short, skull-topped
stave that hung at his belt, but the Pale Lady closed the distance between
his desk and the door, pouncing on screaming Erondis. He reached out, but
the steel flashed across the dark skin of the juvenile erudite&#146;s throat.
A spray of hot, acrid blood fountained across his desk, the tomes he had
been reading, and dripped from his daharil. She turned to face him, her mad
smile broader.<BR>
<BR>
The dark elf clenched the staff tightly, stepping back. Erondi&#146;s head
tilted back on a ravaged neck, and the blood steamed against the coldness
of the room. His eyes were open and vacant, his mouth contorted into a weird
smirk. Shar leaned over her prey like an animal feasting, her ice-blue eyes
meeting his puzzled violet gaze. "Awwww," she cooed, "is that better, daddy?"
<BR>
<BR>
She brought up the knife, slick with gore, and drew it across her tongue,
then pouted with stained lips. Her eyes closed in delight. "Mmmmmm&#133;"
she almost purred. "Winter certainly had good taste!"<BR>
<BR>
He hummed against the unreal, calling on the dirge within him. The word of
power was simple. "Enough." And the vision continued, matching the tempo
of his lament, the dissonance rising against his melody.<BR>
<BR>
Shar leapt, cat like, onto the perch of his desk, driving the dagger into
the wood, through the parchment records of House finances. "I think I&#146;m
still hungry, daddy? What else do yah think I should eat?" She bit down lightly
on her own lip, her azure tattoo&#146;s seemed to twist and flow into a symbol,
a rune that was on the edge of Shiver&#146;s mind.<BR>
<BR>
He pulled on the hate welling inside him, bringing the hoar-frost in a wave
around him. Their breath froze between them, jagged crystals of ice coating
their skin. "I have given thee a taste of death before, daharil. There is
a cure for all things, even madness. I have thy medicine."<BR>
<BR>
Laughter burst forth from the barbarian lass, her insanity given sound in
the jarring cacophony. "Yeah! Yah need to do it right this time, old man!
Finish me or I shut that bone-box of yours fer good!" She shot forward, blurring
into the shape of a pale leopard, a snow cat, but the dark elf had stepped
through the shadows, vanishing to the landing outside the
apartment.<BR>
<BR>
Shiver screamed out in defiance to the vision. "End this torment. I know
thee, Lady Vox. Do nae play games with me." The rushing sounds of the chaos
abruptly ended, leaving only his identity, floating in a void and the soft
sound of the dirge, ever-present despair.</I>

<I>The voice echoed around him, company in the still and darkness. "Greetings,
Lord Dirge, once-dragon. Have I earned your attention?"<BR>
<BR>
His answer was dead-calm. "Ye have earned only my contempt. Ye know I&#146;m
nae capable of pity, dragoness."<BR>
<BR>
Her laugh boomed. "I am disappointed in you. My servants continue to fail.
It will not be long before I must call upon your House to search out the
mad goblins in my own lair. They have delusions of divinity."<BR>
<BR>
"So ye hinder my efforts? A brilliant notion from she that defies her mother.
As ye well know, the House has pain enough without your meddling."
<BR>
<BR>
"Meddling? I send you news of other animations, and one of my greatest vassals,
and you relegate her to weaving songs in taverns instead of assisting you,
as the malfunctioning Erondis was meant to."<BR>
<BR>
"I know little of this Aulura, save that ye have thy claws sunk deeply into
her, and she grows in power. Perhaps this play thing of yours should be closer
t&#146; me. I would be very amused should she surprise thy arrogance and
impale thy grasp."<BR>
<BR>
Again, the Lady Vox laughed, but their was a tension this time, apparent
even in the disjointed dream. "Think what you like, once-dragon. Many servants
have tried to defy me and none have succeeded. Aulura is no exception. Sit
her in little Erondi&#146;s place. With his keepers pursuing love instead
of a solution, he will fail faster. Aulura is strong enough for the tasks
you have in mind."<BR>
<BR>
He understood the vision clearly. Erondis was not fit as his Assistant, though
the enchanter certainly had been the best when his mind was whole. Shar was
the implied future should Shiver fail to find a cure to the afflictions,
personalized. His mind seethed and recoiled at the shackles forming. "I will
appoint Aulura in his place, but listen to me closely. These mind games will
stop. Even golden shackles chaff me, and my discomfort can lead to ready
betrayal. Think ye not that Lord Nagafen and even the Lord Mistmoore approach
me? There are many that would seek this knowledge I hold, and I react to
threats very poorly."<BR>
<BR>
"You would betray the only one who has a mutual interest in your
success?"<BR>
<BR>
Shiver smiled, his teeth brilliantly white against the midnight-blue of his
Teir&#146;dal skin. "I lost my honor long ago, lady. I hold the tattered
threads of a once great tapestry. They are not whole enough to strangle
me."<BR>
<BR>
"Very well. Appoint Aulura and I shall loosen my grip upon her. I need to
see progress, and soon. The Tribunal grows restless and a crusade could destroy
my home, readily. If I die, what do you think your chances for success are?
The barbarians have no love for the servants of Miragul, nor one of their
own who has gone feral in the face of the Tribunal."<BR>
<BR>
He nodded. "I have eluded a harder taskmaster than all the powers of Norrath
could ever hope to rival, but Aulura shall be seated as my Assistant. She
is a worthy successor for Erondis and I her hate for thee is far greater
than mine. Now leave me. My time is precious."<BR>
<BR>
"Go serve the people of Qeynos and impress them with your tails of valor
against the mere children of Black Burrow. We both know the truth."</I>

<I>His eyes snapped open and he was alone in the damp passage to the Aqueducts.
"And that&#146;s my ally," he thought to himself. A small hand stretched
tentatively through the illusion and the dark elf grabbed his staff.
<BR>
<BR>
"Lord Dirge?" It was a young child, a page. He mustered his courage. "Are
you the Master of House Winterborne?" <BR>
<BR>
Shiver smiled, nodding. "That is a duty I bear, young page." He held up his
left hand, the ring finger encircled with a signet-ring adorned with a black
sapphire inlaid with a platinum snow-flake. "What have ye for
me?"<BR>
<BR>
"Two scrolls and one verbal message, m&#146;lord." The boy produces two sealed
scrolls from a pouch hanging at his side.<BR>
<BR>
Shiver reviewed the documents.<BR>
<BR>
(Repost from Malozc)<BR>
"The discoveries I pen to you this day are of mine own observations and not
words retold. The smugglers of High Hold are an outright extension of the
guards' corruption. The organization that &#145;protects&#146; Highhold pass
has nothing but ill planned for those of honor and, as I understand Vox's
missive to me, a direct catalyst of the coming plague. <BR>
<BR>
It is, then, with heavy heart and tired hand, that I send this letter to
you. I plan murder, under the guise of justice. For the corruption that I
see here, I can no longer idly watch. No . . . I must take action. Already
I have dispatched half a score of the smugglers. Sure to my belief, as I
brought their heads to the guards of Highhold, they attacked me. It was only
by sure will power that I was able to rejoin my body and start my mission
once again. Please . . . please send help."<BR>
<BR>
((Repost from Trespare))<BR>
"Let it be known by all of House Winterborne that Lord Amabala Amles of Knights
Valorous has asked for the hand of Lady Trespare of Winterborne in companionship
and Holy marriage. May all take note and consider themselves invited to the
grand proceedings. A date shall be set shortly."<BR>
<BR>
The dark elf nodded, pocketing the notes into the inside pocket of his gossamer
robes. "Ye have an oration for me, lad? If so, then out with it."<BR>
<BR>
He cleared his throat and spoke from memory. "Ladies and genteleman of
Winterborne, I would like to formally announce the engagement of lady Flutrose
Dreamchaser and Saidaar Silverwyrm. The good lady accepted his proposal to
marriage and made him a very happy man. At this time there is no set date
for the ceremony itself but you are all cordially invited to attend when
they do. Saidar wants to thank you for the good wishes they have received
so far, as well."<BR>
<BR>
The dark elf smiled slightly. "The old silver found his match in the Dreamchaser.
And here I thought those of argent weren&#146;t prone to flights of fancy
and hope. And Trespare, has met this Amabala Amles. Do ye know of this House,
lad?"<BR>
<BR>
He nodded slightly, answering the direct question and trying to ignore the
statements he didn&#146;t understand. "I have heard a bit of the Knights
Virtuous and only good, m&#146;lord." <BR>
<BR>
Shiver dipped his eyes slightly, acknowledging the answer. "I have little
in the way of wealth, lad, though ye deserve a reward for delivering these
messages intact t&#146; me. I do have a present ye might value as ye get
a bit older, though." He withdrew a short blade of fine steel from his backpack.
"A little bird gave it to me. Would ye like this token of my
thanks?"<BR>
<BR>
The page smiled broadly. "Yes, sir. I would treasure it." <BR>
<BR>
"I do hope ye don&#146;t keep it as close to thee as it&#146;s former owner
did." He handed it to the page. "Continue thy good service to the House&#133;"
Shiver paused. "What did ye say thy name was?"<BR>
<BR>
"Guesser, sir. My mother said she had to guess who my father was." He looked
a bit red in the face.<BR>
<BR>
Shiver smiled. "Guesser, then. There is no shame in thy birth. Serve my House
well and ye will be welcome by our kind as our power grows. When ye are old
enough t&#146; wield that blade, good service will earn thee a place of honor
within our ranks."<BR>
<BR>
The boy beamed a smile at the dark elf. "Thank you, m&#146;lord. I shall
do my best."<BR>
<BR>
The dark elf nodded. "Isn&#146;t that all we can ask for, Guesser? Have ye
seen the Lady Aulura?" The boy shook his head in affirmation. "Excellent.
If ye would fetch her, I have need of her."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He paused in the writing. It was difficult to separate Trespare from the
fate of Rianna, but he wasn&#146;t convinced the voice he heard was more
than a trick of Vox or his own madness taunting him. Still&#133; he remembered
the marriage of Kaylen to Ariakas, and a surge of hatred drove the bile into
his tightened throat. He closed his eyes, and waited for Lady Aulura to arrive.
They had much to discuss and he could not entrust these missives with the
boy&#133; not yet.</I>

<I>Aulura was lying out enjoying the sunny weather of the Qeynos hills. She
occasionally would pick up her lute and play a soft, ancient sounding melody
she had heard from a vision of the ancient wyrms of Veeshan. <BR>
<BR>
Aulura laid back to rest, her eyes closed to the sun above, relishing the
feeling of the warmth of it on both her skin and scales. She felt she was
truly blessed by her &#147;curse&#148; as she used to garner so much sympathy
from others.<BR>
<BR>
A shadow cut off the sun to her face, letting her feel the coolness and knew
something or someone was above her. She expected it to move off after the
male had finished examining her naked form, but the shadow stayed. Perhaps
it was a bear though the smell was not proper to her nose or tongue, as she
hissed softly to taste the air and see the reaction of the shadow. She was
afraid of nothing that might find her here in the hills. The shadow remained
there. Quickly Aulura reached up and grabbed the boy by the front of his
tunic with her claws and held the other hand at the ready. &#147;Do ye have
a wisssssssssssh to die boy?&#148; She hissed out and scowled at the boy
above her. <BR>
<BR>
&#147;No.. no!&#148; He stuttered out a bit &#147; I bring a mess.. message
from Dirge. He wants you to meet him in the Qeynos aqueducts.&#148;
<BR>
<BR>
&#147;What doesss he want of me boy?&#148; She scowled at him, rising to
her feet and releasing her grip on his neck, leaving tiny marks where her
claws had pressed down.<BR>
<BR>
&#147;I do not know M&#146;lady, he simply wants you there.&#148; The boy
backed up a few steps and looked to Aulura. She nodded and smiled softly,
revealing serpentine fangs. <BR>
<BR>
&#147;Thankee good boy for the messsssssage, I ssshall ssseek him out at
oncssse, I know the way well. Jussst do give me warning nexssst time before
ye play gamesss with me.&#148; She picked up her armor and donned it quickly
and with the singing of a song she was off towards Qeynos nearby. The boy
watched her run off, slowly making his own way back to Qeynos after delivering
the message.<BR>
<BR>
Aulura glanced around to make sure no one saw her entering the illusionary
wall into the Qeynos aqueducts. Her attempts to convince the Bloodsabers
she enjoyed their company so far had been unsuccessful, but she need not
tell the rest of Qeynos she desired it. She nodded to Dirge who stood there
awaiting her. &#147;Greetingsss massster Dirge. What bringsss you to call
upon me? Perhapsss sssome pleasssuresss ye have been missssssing? Or sssomeone
ye need ssslain? Or jussst a drink and a dissscusssion with thisss well hearing
and ssseeing bardessssss?&#148; She grined softly, flashing her fangs at
Dirge as she leaned with her back against the wall.</I>

<I>The dark elf let a slight smile slip as Aulura arrived. As always, she
was somewhere between feral and seductive, though she was not Shiver&#146;s
type. He already had one dangerous play thing; Two would be begging for a
swift betrayal.<BR>
<BR>
"I need neither pleasure nor an assassin, my dear. I have need of someone
t&#146; run the day-to-day affairs of the House in my absences, which seem
to be increasing in duration and frequency. The House needs constant attention
to increase in strength, to hone ourselves into a formidable group. I can
nae provide that, at the moment. Perhaps in a month or two, my forays into
this world will be more frequent, but I fear for the safety of the animations.
Erondis is suffering badly, and I suspect others will continue to malfunction.
The erudite scholar once was an able assistant, capable of leadership in
my stead, but that is no longer the case."<BR>
<BR>
"Thou art my choice for his replacement. Ye have reason to assist stronger
than most. The Lady Vox drives you to servitude. Her Empire will fall without
the cure. And yet, it is blatantly clear ye are not happy with this slavery.
Stand as my second, building our House and working towards the knowledge
of Winter&#146;s animations, and when the solution is in our hands, I will
commit myself t&#146; thy liberation. What say thee?"</I>

<I>Aulura put on a fake pouty face at Dirge&#146;s calling of her not for
pleasure or killing, though the words he continued to speak perked her interest.

Aulura taped the tip of her claw against her chin in thought over the proposition
to her. A chance to ally with a man of much strength, a position of power,
and the promise to be helped to be freed from her servitude. The idea was
desirable to her though she still worried over her forced servitude on all
the Winterborne of Vox. &#147;At leassst none of the Winterborne ever make
commandsss of me, for I mussst follow them asss the lady Voxsss wissshesss,

I&#146;ll gladly acsssept the posssissstion to help thee and houssse Winterborne.
It would be better than sssimply being a ssservant for my life. Thank ye
much for choosssing me massster Dirge.&#148; Aulura kneeled before Dirge
and then rose, giving the drow a small kiss on his cheek. &#147;Are ye sssure
ye don&#146;t have more mundane tasssksss for me?&#148; She grinned and chuckled,
a raspy, hissing chuckle. </I>
