<I>Laish and Zita. It was dusk, that strange, almost mystical interlude when
light and darkness are perfectly balanced. Springing to life in the shadows
of Paineel, they opened their eyes at the same instant, ebony and emerald
peering into each other, searching and finding the answer. They instantly
knew the truth of their existences: they were who halves, split asunder,
and whole only when together. Two beings in perfect accord and harmony, created
for each other.<BR>
<BR>
The two shadow knights had their differences. Laish was worldlier, seeming
to effortlessly soak up knowledge of the land and beasts, whereas Zita was
more introspective and curious about people. They were fiercely protective
of each other, Laish perhaps a bit more so than Zita. The two were haughty
and inconsiderate of other people; but with each other they were gentle,
generous, and kind. Their devotion was total and without reservation. Some
might disbelieve that followers of Cazic-Thule could feel love; others would
say it was unnatural, and that they were flawed. But Zita and Laish never
doubted, nor did they even question it, for they knew that each one was half
of the other.<BR>
<BR>
They wandered throughout Paineel and began to interact with other people.
Zita would laugh when Laish flirted with other women, his fluid voice charming
and seductive, only to crush their burgeoning feelings as soon as Zita sauntered
to his side. Zita often gave Laish the same amusement, smiling suggestively
at other men, purposefully giving them hope of conquest, until Laish would
stride to her side and slip his arms around her. Together they would mock
and laugh at the expressions that crossed the faces of those with whom they
toyed. Such little cruelties amused them.<BR>
<BR>
But the two Erudites were not stupid. They quickly learned how to manipulate
others in order to attain their goals. They learned how to mask their feelings
and intentions, how to act in ways that would mislead others. Laish excelled
in giving the impression of courtliness and gallantry, whereas Zita would
act sweetly and innocently, using her beauty to blind others to her true
personality. These talents stood them in good stead, and they honed them
to perfection.<BR>
<BR>
Laish was ever an opportunist. Talk sprang up in Paineel of two mages who
were seeking snake eggs in great quantities. These mages were soon to be
married, and the bride was determined to serve only the finest cuisine at
their reception; hence her need for eggs. The groom would go to any lengths
to satisfy his future wife. Laish hired a courier and sent a bold proposition
to the mages: he and Zita would give them two hundred snake eggs, in exchange
for the mages&#146; supplying them with full sets of banded armor as well
as fine weapons. His offer was accepted without hesitation. Within a few
hours he and Zita had collected the eggs. They celebrated by swimming in
a secluded pool of water in Paineel, giggling and smirking at how they had
swindled the mages.<BR>
<BR>
Preening in their new armor and experimentally swinging their new weapons,
the shadow knights started to hunt in Toxxulia Forest. They delighted in
watching their prey crumple before them, especially when one of them would
lay hands upon their foe, the power of Cazic-Thule flowing through their
fingertips and sucking out the life of their victim. At other times they
would simply hack and slash, enjoying the spurting of blood and broken bodies
falling to the ground. They began to grow in hunting prowess, and felt the
inklings of impatience at the limited opportunities that Odus
offered.<BR>
<BR>
One day as they hunted a stranger appeared: a male in armor, also of Erudite
blood. He introduced himself as Olamm and suggested they hunt together. They
agreed, and the three began conversing. Olamm laughed and said something
in regards to it being his luck to meet two evil warriors. &#147;Laish? Why
does he call us &#147;evil&#148;? Zita had no concept of good and evil; to
her, things were simply as they were. &#147;Evil is a word that people apply
to those who do not believe as they do, my dear.&#148; Laish softly spoke
his reply, making certain that Olamm overheard.<BR>
<BR>
The next day Olamm arranged transportation for the trio to another city called
Qeynos, on the far away continent of Antonica. This he did by enlisting the
aid of two people he called &#147;friends&#148;: a female of gigantic proportions
and odd blue markings on her skin named Sharhel, and a male who appeared
to be garbed in various types of leather named Dhirge. Sharhel and Dhirge
practiced magic far stronger than Laish and Zita had ever seen. The seeming
benefits of friendship as well as their own need for such aid were quickly
impressed upon the two. They decided to search for others who would be willing
to help them, become their companions. Then Olamm told them of a family he
belonged to, called a &#147;guild.&#148; This group was known as
&#147;Winterborne.&#148; Dhirge and Sharhel also belonged to this guild,
as did many other people. It seemed to be the type of haven that Zita and
Laish sought, and they determined to further investigate the Winterborne.</I>
