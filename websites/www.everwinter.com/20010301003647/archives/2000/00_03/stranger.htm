<I>The pale lady's sleep was a restless one that night. His song was there,
but distant. The haunting dirge was forever on the edge of her consciousness.
It did little to comfort her, however. Who was this Eglantyne, this nuisance
that insisted on questioning what she was? Her conversation with him was
troubling. His interest in Winterborne was fanatical; his knowledge of the
guild and its members seemingly exhaustive.<BR>
<BR>
Shar tried to wave off the edgy feeling she got from the stranger. Afterall,
Winterborne wasn't hiding their plight from anyone. Still&#133;everyone had
motives. And she was certain this Eglantyne was no exception. "Tomorrow is
a new day, mystery man. I will find ye and know ye as well as ye assume to
know Winterborne." Shar spoke under her breath as she finally nodded off
to a fitful sleep of broken dreams.</I>

<I>Eglantyne casually tossed aside the branch of wood, droplets of blood
clinging to it. Several of them splashed upon the face of the cleric who
lay dead at her feet. She bent over his body and plucked the magical mace
from his side. She hefted it, and thought with satisfaction that it would
serve her needs until a better weapon came along. Her mind had felt the pain
of the cleric as he died, but it meant nothing to her.<BR>
<BR>
It had been a simple matter to lie in wait for the man. He had paid her not
the slightest bit of attention as he piously knelt in prayer before the Temple
of Divine Light, she obviously being nothing more than a poor student of
no importance. The glint of the mace dangling from his belt had attracted
her attention. All she had to do was hide herself in Toxxulia forest and
wait for him to stop and rest during his travels. It had been so deceptively
easy, smashing in the back of his head with the tree branch that the priests
had given her for a weapon.<BR>
<BR>
The priests at the Temple were fools, every one of them. Her earliest memories
consisted of hearing their incessant chanting to Quellious, constant voices
which flooded her ears even as she tried to sleep. They had sought to form
her into one of themselves. What idiots they were! She had once been beaten
nigh unto death during a training session when she'd had the common sense
to tend to herself before healing a companion. Since that time she had been
careful to give every outward appearance of conforming to their standards.
But no more. She no longer had any use for the priests and gladly set aside
all pretensions of agreeing with their beliefs. She would serve no man or
god. The only thing that mattered was herself.<BR>
<BR>
Bah, did they think her as stupid as themselves? Apparently they did, for
they had blessed her many times over, then gave her a meager garment and
supposed "weapon," which was nothing more than a branch cut from a tree.
They had then sent her into the world, exhorting her to bring pride upon
their names. She spat contemptuously on the ground at the memory. They were
like all the other blind people in Norrath who saw only what lay before their
eyes, never having the intelligence to seek out the feelings that lay within
people.<BR>
<BR>
Eglantyne began making her way to the dock of Erudin, attracting the eye
of an enchanter wearing a bright yellow robe. A gleam of interest shone in
his eyes as they roamed up and down her figure. She sensed a blackness in
him which he sought to cover with the guise of kindness. He introduced himself
and gave her a magical breastplate, as well as other items. He then wished
her well and departed. Eglantyne made careful note to herself to remember
his name. It was Morphite. She also noted the badge he wore, which identified
him as belonging to a group called "Winterborne."<BR>
<BR>
Eglantyne enjoyed the fresh sea air blowing across her face as the ship carried
her to Qeynos. Upon arriving, she sauntered through the streets, chancing
upon a tavern with a nearby pond. Nearby walked a female dark elf who was
holding the hand of a high elf child. Obviously just an orphan or another
child of inconvenience to its parents. She did not feel sorry for the child.
Parents were nothing more than two people who copulated and deposited the
resulting offspring with others to raise. She briefly wondered how many platinum
her parents had donated to bribe the priests of Quellious to raise her. This
question she quickly put from her mind; it did not matter, in fact it had
never mattered.<BR>
<BR>
She spent much time wandering the alleys and pubs, and often relaxed outside
the city gates, listening to mundane chatter and, when someone seemed
particularly interesting, allowing her mind to probe into their feelings.
One day she felt a darkness that seemed familiar. She turned and saw Morphite.
He was speaking to several other people who apparently belonged to his clan,
for they all wore the "Winterborne" insignia. Though young, the group had
the appearance of wealth and the self-assurance of people who knew they had
others they could depend upon. A spark of interest gleamed in Eglantyne's
mind. Such a group could be useful to her until she grew strong enough to
need no protection or aid.</I>
