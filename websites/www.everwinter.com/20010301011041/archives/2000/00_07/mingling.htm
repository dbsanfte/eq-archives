<I>Zsalshun stretched and watched a group slaughter a treant. She smiled;
she did not think she would ever tire of watching the menacing trees fall.
She thought to tarry a bit longer but she had a long trip ahead of her. With
the blessings of the wolf still fresh from Shar&#146;s last casting, the
priestess headed out to Lake Rathatier and the dark swamps beyond that lay
between here and her homeland. Tonight she was going to meet a new menace;
hopefully one that had more clues to the Winter ailment.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The priestess frowned at the thought. Again, she was returning to her
roots but this time it was not to hide but to seek. She had come to terms
with the fact that her research was quicker and easier within the confines
of the guild but she still felt uneasy dealing with many of the members.
Her thoughts were cut short by a perfunctory whisper in her mind **Get to
the Druid Rings in Northern Karana, Priestess** Morphite&#146;s dark tones
of impatience cut through her musings and the Priestess turned back on her
trail. The enchanter had arranged for a teleport and the Tier&#146; Dal could
almost see him foaming with impatience. It did save her the unpleasantness
of wading through miles of swamp life to get to the far side of the world.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>After being dropped off in the midst of a coven of druids and their servant
trees, Zsalshun ran invisible to the borders of her homeland. Here there
were no giant trees hell bent on destroying her. A quick run through the
forests of her child hood brought her to the land of lava and the new menace
to conquer; Shadowed men.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Keldore, Amorsaylnn, Morphite, Trespare and Birik were already scouting
out the shadowed men when the priestess arrived. She nodded to each and began
casting the customary shielding spells. The group had cordoned off a section
below the shadow&#146;s camp and used the calming magics of Trespare to lure
one at a time to their battlefield. It worked well and many of the invisible
men fell to the blades and spells of the group. Nothing, save a few words,
were found on the bodies.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Later that eve, a familiar &#147;Hello&#148; bellowed out of the night
and the priestess smiled as she recognized Balkin&#146;s stout visage. There
were too many Winterborne to fight effectively so it was decided to split
into two groups and step up the slaughter. With so many available, both groups
made short work of the shadowed men and a call was made to take their camp
directly.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The shadowed men were no match for the lightening blades of the stout
dwarf and lithe ranger and soon, as at the base of the camp, the Winterborne
frightened the enemy into being more cautious. Fewer shadows came to try
to retake their land so that the dark priestess even got to help with melee
and cast her limiting damage spell. All was going smoothly, albeit with little
progress as to why the shadowed menace chose to take arms against the lady
Vox, until Balkin excused himself. Amorsaylnn, Keldore and Zsalshun sat down
to med and mend, leaving the few scouts to the other team. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Moments later, a cry of alarm rose up as the other team realized Trespare
also had excused herself to attend to other matters quickly. Suddenly, the
hill top was alive with Wizards meleeing and priests attempting to out damage
the shadow scouts and all hoping vainly the warriors returned soon. The casters
held for a brief time, then the shadows became bold in the face of those
not trained to wield a blade and pushed hard. Morphite called a retreat and
everyone narrowly escaped.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>At the bottom of the hill Amorsaylnn and Keldore said their farewells
and went about their business. Nothing was learned as to the reason for the
shadow men&#146;s aggression towards the Winter cursed and the remainder
of the group faded away to continue on with their own musings. The dark Priestess
took one last look at the hilltop camp and nodded to her adversaries. She
would be back to discover what they knew, but now she had business to attend
to in Nerriak.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>((OOC: It was a good time and we held well against the respawn despite
the uncoordinated leaving of our tanks. Only Birik died, which is better
than I had counted. I think Keldore gated with 4 HP left. Ouch.))</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The groups power, indeed had impressed Morphite. The enchanter had fallen
not once, but twice, during each of their previous engagements. It seemed
a ritual Vox had organized for him. He could almost hear her say to her minions,
"follow Morphite, see to it that he perishes each day . . . no, twice each
day!" 'Bitch,' he uttered. He hated her. He hated her mysterious way of making
him learn everything in the most difficult way. It wasn't until she had allowed
Shar, the barbarian to find a mysterious parchment of tactics for his kind,
that everything started to make sense. He was indeed ready to set up that
inn in South Karana, and retire from adventure. Perhaps Vox sensed that and
decided to test Winterborne's cohesiveness by giving the knowledge to Shar
and not him. No matter. The group passed the test and grew more powerful
each day.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>No, this day Morphite would not fall. It was amazing to him that this
rag-tag group of Vox's gathering was indeed measuring up to what she wanted.
What that was, who knew. But he was caught smiling and even exclaiming his
joy once or twice, at the group's prowess.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>And so it was, with that confidence and excitement, that he called to
take the rift site of the shadow men. Indeed, why not? They had succeeded
in keeping the site clean. Why not continue the fight to the very site of
their entrance to Norrath?</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Well, there are many reasons not to do this. It's difficult to coordinate
the splitting of the beasts. As they were brought down in pairs, they tended
to return in pairs. The distance that Trespare and Balkin had run before
allowed them to split them up. Now, however, wizards and clerics were forced
into melee until the melee-types were available to engage. No, that decision
would not be made again. Indeed, even with the nasty terrain Lavastorm, they
groups did well until the call to engage the rift directly. No, that call
would not be made again.</I>
