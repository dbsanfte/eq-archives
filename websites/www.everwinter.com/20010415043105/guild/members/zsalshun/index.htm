	      I do not know. I have my doubts that I am even one of these so called
	      "animations" although the odd device held in Flutrose&#146;s hand attested
	      to my being one. Any gnome worth their salt can fashion such a device to
	      dupe the unwary and guile the gullible. So why do I come at all? My answer

	<I>My earliest memories were of my father and the church. He was not a priest,
	nor was he a magic wielder of any sort that I could divine. He did not fight
	well either, although he served as a guard in Neriak. What he did do was
	hang about the Blind Fish drinking and pushing me to become better than my
	peers. He hung about me when I came home from the temple and grilled me on
	what I had learned. He was quick to see that I was not brainwashed by the
	brotherhood of Innurak but told me that I should never voice these thoughts
	to anyone but himself. I lived my young years this way, spending time between
	the temple and the Blind Fish, which I grew to call home. Of my mother, I
	never knew.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>My father would often ask if anything peculiar happened and I would always
	answer nothing out of the ordinary. Which was the truth as I saw it. Every
	few months I would have a "vision", but that too was not particularly odd.
	I had been having these visions since I was a very young child and I had
	always assumed they were gifts from Innurak. My father asked with such intensity
	and scrutiny and was vastly relieved when I answered "no" that I continued
	to do so. I rationalized that these messages from my god would only upset
	someone who had very little faith in them. That and I was uneasy by the
	calculating look he always gave me.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>My first accomplishment as a young adult was to acquire the deed to the
	inn I called home. It was a simple means to dupe and kill the current owner
	and I did it well enough to not get caught. The hired help was suspicious
	of my sudden ownership but I am a fair master and soon eased their fears.
	I took pride in the Blind Fish, perhaps to my detriment, but it earned me
	the coin I needed to buy weapons and spells. That and the underground windows
	were the best remedy I had found to relieve stress. There is nothing quite
	so amusing as a swimming leatherfoot deputy viewed as a fish would see him.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>My ownership progressed well as did my studies. I was almost ready to
	join the ranks of the defenders of our forest. The temple will give it&#146;s
	apprentice clergy a small badly balanced club for beating heads in and 2
	spells and send them out with the blessings of our god to certainly die at
	the feet of the guards or guardians. The Fish enabled me to purchase a fine
	quality weapon, my first ranking of spells and a piece or two of cheap armor
	to protect myself. And thus I adventured, considerably ahead of the other
	novices who were tossed out naked and weak.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I learned much. I learned that I had a penchant for undead and spent weeks
	at the obelisk that they called home. I met an enchanting young rogue with
	a sharp wit and tongue that made the hunting more bearable and of course,
	the enchanter Makaz. Makaz made the Fish as much a home as my father and
	I did. He was much older than I and at first was not entirely certain of
	my talents. I proved to him that the clergy of Innurak were not to be scorned
	and we adventured well together. He became one of the few people I could
	"trust" if there is such a word in my language. At least, he became one of
	the few people I knew who would consider selling any information he had gleaned
	from me at a higher price. That is considerable trust in the underdark world
	of my home.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>And so I learned. I gained in power and wealth, sharing much with Makaz
	in hopes to sway him into friendship. He was a remarkable smith and aspired
	to become a jeweler. Both of which I needed access to but did not quite have
	the coin to spend on the open market. Shamelessly, I chipped at his capitalistic
	nature and bargained a suit of armor from him at a very good price. The proceeds
	from the fish adequately compensated my spending. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I was still quite young when the elf and his wife were brought in. I never
	saw the male, he was dispatched before I entered the third gate, however
	the female I had the distinct displeasure of seeing. She was a pathetic thing.
	She cried and whimpered in her hauntingly familiar tongue and looked about
	with large, frightened and uncomprehending eyes. We laughed and the guards
	took turns abusing her in many different and exotic ways. She just lay there,
	confused and shivering like a small pup or kitten as the guards taunted and
	beat her. Not once did she fight back. It became a spectacle of the guards
	having their way in such an easy fashion that I grew disgusted. What is the
	challenge of torturing a bear cubling? Or even a ratling? For that is what
	it was like to watch. My respect for my fellow Tier&#146;Dal was lessened
	that day as they prolonged her misery for their own fun without a hint of
	challenge or danger. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I said as much to the gallivanting warriors, putting all the scorn and
	disgust I felt into my words. I made no friends as I pointed that this one
	was hardly worthy of their skills, yet they dallied over her as if she were
	the most deserving of foes. I wondered out loud at their prowess that they
	enjoyed such an easy fight. The arena was still, save the quiet sobs of the
	woman. I shook my head at them and offered to kill her so that the next prisoner
	could be brought forth. The head guardsman smiled wickedly at me and said
	her life was for sale only and after I bought her I could do with her what
	I pleased. I agreed to his outrageous sum and left to gather my coin.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>It was far more than I had ever earned, but I had one recourse left to
	me. The deed to the Fish would cover the sum with just a little left over
	for me to continue to live off of, plus, I had a ready buyer in my father.
	He had always been surprised of my acquisition and jealous of the income
	it earned for me. He would pay the money and gloat over how he had won the
	deed. It did not matter much to me anymore, my faith in my god was always
	week and now my pride in my race was tarnished. He bought the deed, I bought
	the slave and considered adventuring out of the city never to return.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Unfortunately, I was still not wise enough to brave the far off lands
	at that time and the Slave woman was now my charge. I did not expect her
	to live through the night, but I made her comfortable and tended her wounds
	as best as I could. She surprised me by living. She surprised me again by
	showing that she knew something about gems and how to fashion them into jewelry.
	I smiled, aware that with her I had another source of income to replace that
	of the Fish. Who my customers would be was another problem. My fellow
	Tier&#146;Dal did not take kindly to my pointing out their episode in such
	a bad light and I found that doors that were always open began to close.
	My father even decided to charge rent, which I paid off by working at the
	bar. I spent even more time out in the wilds practicing my skill. I never
	understood why Innurak stayed with me even as my own temple turned their
	backs.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>It was on one of these trips just after that first night that I found
	the babe. It had been in the woods for perhaps a day, maybe two and had survived.
	She was a tiny thing, quiet as a grave but alert to her surroundings. She
	was also dressed in the same house pattern as the slave woman. I never knew
	what possessed a high elven couple to cross the forests of my people with
	an infant child but it appears as if they had tried. I sighed and picked
	up the babe. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>The mother was horrified to see her child. I suspect she thought the babe
	was safely away with the father, and seeing the small bundle hidden in my
	cloak told her that the male did not make it. She cried for days afterwards
	and clung to the child like it was her lifeline. My father did not know about
	the child, and as the child was flawed and could not utter a single sound,
	there were no cries to give it&#146;s presence away. I did not trust this
	to last very long, as my father had a habit of bursting into my room for
	whatever reason, so I pried the child from the mother&#146;s arms and quietly
	went to see Makaz. I needed him to help me hide the babe away from my father
	who would probably kill it on site. Only my diligence and a stipend of my
	earned money to Makaz kept the child and the slave woman safe.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Both measures were not quite enough. Upon returning from a hunt of the
	desert with Makaz, I found the slave woman dead in my room, her eyes bulged
	out and her black tongue swollen and falling out of her mouth. Makaz also
	lost the servant who was watching over her. The child remained undiscovered,
	as did her mother&#146;s killer for quite some time. Only after I stumbled
	upon the diary kept by my father did I begin to understand what had happened.
	He kept volumes of books which he wrote his thoughts and deeds down on in
	a secret room in the older recesses of the Fish. He also kept books of magic
	and various powerful items and scrolls. I sat for hours uncovering the secret
	truths about him, myself and the life I had been brought up in.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>In his earliest books, well before even my mother&#146;s mother was born
	he talked about a winter device. Much of the writing was in a tongue I could
	not read, but I have always been a quick study and an apt pupil and I copied
	down the few diagrams I found along with the words they contained to research
	later. I also discovered that this man was not my true father, but a necromancer
	of great power who had decided to create the ultimate undead fighter. He
	talked about his experiments, always named Zsalshun, who worked well until
	they started to loose their minds. I never found the book that told what
	he did to us to make us this way, only a reference to finding another suitable
	babe for his experiment. This time, a dark elf. I also found the entry that
	told of how he had eradicated the distraction to his newest Zsalshun and
	that I should return to my studies shortly now that that was over.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I left his small study as I had found it, save I had gained a determination
	to kill the man who posed as my father. I harbored this for years as I grew
	in power. My "father" was a drinker and a fine gambler, something which supported
	him more than the Fish did. However, Makaz was slightly better at cards and
	fit well into my plan. I told the enchanter nothing but watched for an
	opportunity when he and my "father" would be at the same table with the stakes
	fairly high. It came to pass that both were involved in a game of cards that
	lasted well into the small hours of the night. Both were drinking and with
	help from me, Makaz was feeling the liquor less and my "father" more. I served,
	they played. I kept my presence on the fringes of my "father&#146;s" conscience
	as he began to loose more and more frequently. I reminded him by my very
	person of the bar he had bought. As the last hand came into play, he had
	run out of finances save that one wrinkled piece of paper that made the
	establishment his. His hand was good, but I wagered that Makaz&#146;s was
	better. The enchanter played his cards close but I had a feeling that my
	"father&#146;s" luck was about to run out for good. The deed went up, Makaz
	laid down and my stunned "father" watched as his establishment was swept
	off of the table into the arms of the enchanter.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>It took not more than a few seconds for him to react and when he did,
	it was with the drunken lunge of a desperate man. Makaz wasn&#146;t quite
	fast enough to retreat unharmed, but quick enough to leave with his life.
	He will always have the scar where my "father&#146;s" knife bit into him
	and I will always have the satisfaction of seeing my "father" bested and
	having a small hand in it. If Makaz&#146;s own knife hadn&#146;t ended my
	"father&#146;s" ambitions, the slow poison I had been feeding him all night
	would have. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I had nothing left for me in the underground city and a small child
	who&#146;s life remained in danger every minute she stayed in this town.
	I finally decided that I had gained what knowledge I needed to know in order
	to leave. I had no idea where to go, but I knew that Neriak was not the place
	to raise the child elf. Makaz suggested to me to try and find a group known
	as Winterborne. The name made me uneasy, as it was very close to the
	Winter&#146;s Device that I had sketched and translated from my "father&#146;s"
	books, but whether Makaz knew about this or not, he never said. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I and the child set out the next day with Makaz&#146;s help and the three
	of us journeyed across the land to the city of Qeynos. Amber, for that is
	as best as I could come to pronouncing the name her mother called her, and
	I stayed while Makaz journeyed back home. And so it is for the child as well
	as some questions I have of my own that I joined this house. I wonder if
	my visions are what the man whom I called father was looking for as signs
	of me loosing my mind or if these are truly gifts of an interestingly patient
	god. Perhaps these questions can be answered, perhaps not. Time will tell.</I>
