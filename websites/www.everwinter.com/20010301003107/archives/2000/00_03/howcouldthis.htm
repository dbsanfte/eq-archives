<I>Aye, me head... What was I thinking?<BR>
<BR>
Balkin lay in bed, wondering how this could have happened. He'd nae had a
hangover like this one since his acceptance into the warrior ranks in
Kaladim!<BR>
<BR>
He had journeyed long, and found the Winterborne, as the old Sage in Freeport
had suggested. After several adventures with them, he had asked for admittance
into the guild. It did appear that they had a common goal, a common need.
A common desire to know, to find, to seek. <BR>
<BR>
His actual induction into the guild took place, ironically, back in Freeport.
Lady Flutrose met him there, and formally invited him into the guild. They
retired to the Jade in North Freeport for a celebration. A call was put out
to the Winterborne, and friends of the guild, to meet in North Freeport to
celebrate his induction.<BR>
<BR>
Balkin shook his head slightly trying to clear it, the pain intensified,
eliciting a groan of pain from the scarred Dwarven warrior. T&#146;was impossible
to concentrate, let alone remember all who attended. He knew for sure he
would suffer from this one for awhile. Carefully, he sat up on the bunk,
wondering briefly which establishment he was in. They had visited more than
one.<BR>
<BR>
As he sat there, head in hands, staring at the floor, a memory arose from
the nether regions of his brain. He shot to his feet in alarm! NO! Did I
really do that? <BR>
<BR>
The pain in his head forced him to sit again, after splashing water from
the basin on his face and letting it run through his beard. How could that
have happened?! A strip tease on the bar? Balkin groaned his pain and horror
into his hands. They'll never let me forget it!<BR>
<BR>
Balkin lay back down, the memory returning, despite his wish for it to disappear
forever. He remembered slugging down eight Elven wines in a row, becoming
so intoxicated that he could nae even see straight. Vaguely he remembered
struggling his way onto the bar and standing there.<BR>
<BR>
What happened next brought both a moan of pain to the addled dwarf, and a
sheepish grin. He had nae sang those dwarven drinking songs in years! The
racket must have been nie unbearable for those with more sensitive ears.
He laughed at his own foolishness, followed by another wash of pain through
his head. "Aye, a fool ye be Balkin", he muttered to himself. The clatter
of his Bronze armor hitting the floor must have been deafening! The vague
memory took shape in his mind, as he relived the night before. He'd jumped
up on the bar, and started roaring a dwarvish drinking song, then he'd begun
a striptease on the bar! Stripping off his bronze armor piece by piece, and
letting it drop to the floor. Several of those in attendance cheered him
on, some laughing and throwing coins at his feet, some in the audience even
following suit by taking off their armor and robes!<BR>
<BR>
Balkin looked down at his body, scars covering him nearly everywhere. How
someone could have thrown coins at him was a mystery indeed. He knew he was
nae much to look at, and frequently paid higher prices for goods because
the Merchant or Innkeeper did nae like his looks, sometimes refusing to deal
with him entirely! He was a warrior, battle was his profession, scars came
with the territory. <BR>
<BR>
Yet for some reason, they did nae fade on him... All, even those taken when
he first left Kaladim, still had a purplish, red cast to them. None had faded,
not in all the time he had been in this world. A mystery indeed, and he found
himself suddenly embarrassed. He had nae worried about his scars before,
he was a warrior, and the scars he bore gave testament to that fact, but
with his new friends, suddenly it was different.<BR>
<BR>
Balkin forced himself to stand, and carefully made his way back to the pitcher
on the table. He poured the water there over his head, and gasped at the
coldness of it, shocking him into a more normal awareness. He then picked
up his armor, it needed tending.<BR>
<BR>
Nearly an hour later, Balkin clomped down the stairs to the common room to
break his fast. The Innkeeper grinned at him and was about to comment, but
the glare in Balkins eye, and the hands on the swords sheathed at his hips
caused the Innkeeper to step back, gulp audibly, then turn to the kitchens
for some bread and water. This inn would probably be closed to him now as
well. Balkin Sighed, running his fingers over the scars on the back of his
right hand. His helm and gauntlets sat on the table in front of him. It was
nearly time, and he had work to do. That is, if he ever intended to master
Blacksmithing, as his father had done.<BR>
<BR>
Twenty minutes later, helm in place, and pulling his gauntlets on, Balkin
stepped out into the sunlight from the inn. The glare caused his head to
ache fiercely, but Balkin deemed it just punishment for his over indulgence
the night before. There was a Blacksmithing shop around the corner that allowed
aspiring smiths to use their forge, when time permitted. He turned towards
the shop, and started off. Perhaps the hard work would burn this foul headache
away, and perhaps brighten his mood.<BR>
<BR>
As he approached the Blacksmithing shop Balkin stopped briefly, and looked
at his armor, glowing in the sun. He vowed then, that never again would be
unclothed before the others. The bandaging and stiching of wounds could nae
be avoided, but he would nae be embarrassed before them again.<BR>
<BR>
He stepped into the dark shop from the street and looked around. The forge
was available, and the Smith was there. The human grinned at Balkin from
behind the counter. "Heard you had a good time last night over at the Jade"!
<BR>
<BR>
Grrrrr....</I>

<I>It was with a glad heart that Flutrose handed the scroll to Balkin, formally
inviting him to become a member of House Winterborne. Though most of his
body was covered with glorius bronze armor, what little she could see was
criss-crossed with angry-looking scars. That was noted, and immediately dismissed
from her mind. His face looked gruff, and his expression gave the impression
that he would brook no nonsense from anyone; but searching deeper, she saw
the kindness in his heart, his concern for others. Aye, she was welll pleased
with Balkin.<BR>
<BR>
After handing him the scroll, Flutrose invited Balkin to the Jade Tiger for
a glass of wine. What she really had in mind was to put him at ease and get
him in a frame of mind for talking, that she might learn more about his
background and goals in life.<BR>
<BR>
On the way to the Jade Tiger, Balkin and Flutrose encountered Kerilar. The
mage was also eager to introduce Balkin to the Winterborne he had not yet
met, so of course she invited Kerilar to accompany them for a drink. The
three were then accosted by a begging bard of the 4th String. Kerilar and
Balkin convinced the begger to go elsewhere, and the trio continued on their
way.<BR>
<BR>
They settled down in the common room of the Jade Tiger, and the drinks began
to flow. Kerilar seemed somewhat tense and out of sorts. Thinking back to
their most recent conversation, Flutrose thought she knew the reason why;
she sighed to herself and mentally returned to the party. She was shocked
when Kerilar quickly became thoroughly intoxicated and began shouting for
dancing girls. This was a Kerilar she had never seen before! Balkin of course
roared his approval of this idea. Now what am I going to do? she thought
to herself. I'm with a drunken wolf and drunken dwarf who want dancing girls!
She decided it was time to call in reinforcements. To be honest, Flutrose
herself wasn't completely steady on her feet by that time.<BR>
<BR>
Matters rapidly worsened. The acccursed begging bard found their little party,
and began once again to ply his trade (that of begging, not singing). The
men became upset, and then the bard said something that angered Kerilar.
Kerilar dragged the bard into the street, and Balkin ran behind, yelling
at Kerilar to wait, so that he too could help teach the begger some manners.
Flutrose ran behind, quite helpless to do anything; neither of her friends
paid her a bit of mind anyways as they were so incensed with the
begger.<BR>
<BR>
Kerilar angrily but politely told Flutrose to be quiet. A minute later, he
removed himself from their party, cast a spell, and both his wolf form and
the begger vanished. Upon his return, Kerilar seemed pleased with himself.
He quickly reassured Flutrose that everything was fine, he had merely taken
the begger to North Karanas. A moment of doubt flashed through Flutrose's
mind, but she quickly ignored it. Kerilar was the most honest and honorable
of men; she was certain that the bard was completely healthy when the two
parted company. Though she did have doubts about the youngster's ability
to make it alive back to Freeport. Oh well, that was his concern, not
hers.<BR>
<BR>
Morphite, the enchanter Erudite, was not about to be left out of the fun,
and donated his stock of Ogre Swill to the group. Flutrose covered her distate
with a mask of politeness, and sipped the Swill, inwardly grimacing as the
horrible drink made its way down into her stomach. Morphite was soon the
drunkest one in the party.<BR>
<BR>
Rhyianna also wanted to come, but was on another continent, in Butcherblock.
Kerilar swayed as he cast the spell, and soon the entire party was drinking
in the wilds of Faydwar. Rhy was her normal beautiful self, and the men were
quickly enchanted with her.<BR>
<BR>
All except Morphite, that is. The drunken enchanter held onto Flutrose for
support, though it was likely she wasn't much help due to her own intoxicated
condition. Morphite pulled Flutrose off to the side, and then sank to the
ground and commenced wretching. Half-digested Ogre Swill splattered upon
the grass and all over Flutrose's shoes. She looked at Morphite in horror
and disgust, as he tried to mumble out drunken apologies. She began to back
away from him, but he grabbed the hem of her Robe of the Elements, preventing
her from leaving. With a complete look of disbelief upon her face, she watched
as he raised her robe to his lips and began wiping his mouth upon it. She
was shocked absolutely speechless, and anger flashed through her at Morphite's
lack of decorum. She cared not that he was ill, as she knew he would soon
recover from his self-induced malady. She looked down at her Robe and shoes,
then grimaced.<BR>
<BR>
The group made their way back to the Jade Tiger, laughing and swaying the
entire way. They were joined by Ronne, the monk who was newly betrothed to
Rhyianna. This was merely another reason to celebrate, and soon the wine
and mead was flowing more quickly than the water cascades from the waterfall
in Rivervale. The noise of the duel celebration awakened Saidaar, and he
quickly joined the party.<BR>
<BR>
Flutrose was happy. She was with friends who were laughing and singing. Balkin
tried to crawl on top of the bar, but fell down. After many attempts he finally
made it to the top. He began singing (more like shouting, to be honest) dwarven
drinking songs. Flutrose clapped and whistled as he began to strip off his
armor, the pieces slipping from his drunken hands and landing with loud clangs
upon the floor. Ronne and Rhyianna quickly shed their clothing and danced
in front of Balkin, who continued to sing and gyrate upon the bar. Flutrose
sat on a table watching, holding onto Saidaar for support. The group shouted
encouragement for Flutrose to toss aside her robe and join them. She was
tempted to do so; then she remembered the ghastly maimed appendage that passed
as her left leg, and steadfastly refused to participate.<BR>
<BR>
The floor of the Jade Tiger became slippery with spilled drinks, and the
din of the happy partygoers reached into the streets of Freeport. Flutrose
really wasn't coherent of too much by this point; she thought Saidaar
half-carried, half-dragged her away and deposited her into a room. She soon
passed out, still clutching the soiled Robe in her fingers like an icon.</I>
