<I>Javhyri leapt from the window and landed into the trees down below. He
swiftly climbed down to the ground and looked up into the window one last
time to bid his companion a last farewell. He knew the young monk would triumph
in his quest and would once again restore the pride and honor of this temple.
He turned his back and once again began his journey. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He was about half a day from the temple before his thoughts focused
elsewhere...he had trouble shaking the young monk out of his head. It wasnt
common for one as Javhyri to get hung up on one thought, specially one as
these...and as much as he would hate to admit, he missed the words spoken
to him as they traveled down the paths, even though Javhyri never answered
him, Jun always had something to say about something. Perhaps the noise poluted
his mind...or perhaps it was something else alltogether, nevertheless he
had a long journey ahead of him and these thoughts would only get in the
way of his path. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He made a fist and turn his hand over and back the other way examining
his new seeming. The young half-elven form was quick, cunning, and strong,
it was perfect for him. The way the battle had gone was very much to Javhyri's
liking, this surfaced a grin to his face. The skin that was tan had now became
a dark greyish color looking more elven then human...in fact his entire body
was elven, if it hadnt been for the shape of his eyes and the texture of
his medium grey hair. He didnt look drow but was definitely a look of a dark
elf. Reaching into his bag he pulled out a book covered with ancient runes,
same as his swords and bow, the waved his hand over the top of the book and
enchanted a few words of magic, he then opened the book and began to flip
through the pages. Often when he traveled alone he would dive into his spellbook
and study his spells as he walked. It killed time and allowed him to refresh
his mind with the magical words. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He traveled three nights and three days before stopping for rest, many
times he shifted directions getting a sense of pull from whatever direction
he turned to. He slept a little then continued on...four days had past when
he finally arrived at a small city maybe half a days travel from a mountain
range. He decide it would be best to get a good sleep at an inn and perhaps
a meal and some drink...it also wouldnt be a bad idea for him to get some
more supplies for the road either...maybe see if some work existed in this
city. Satisfied with his decision he traveled off into the city seeking shelter
for the night.</I>

<I>Two weeks the dark stranger had travelled two weeks till he had found
the town his instinct led him to. It was a small city rather, and not too
keen on criminal types. The town made him wince, if he wasnt on a much more
indepth venture at the moment he would have shown the town perhaps a thing
or two about real darkness. It wasnt long before word spread back to him
that the Temple of IO to the north was under new rule and that humanoids
were now able to join the Brotherhood in it's teachings. This brought a grin
to the Elf's lips, he knew the young monk would grab hold of destiny and
make use of his beliefs, though the thought of having such a care for any
one being almost made him choke on his grin. It was a side of him that he
would have to deal with..a flaw he'd say. Thinking back to the monk led him
to the name given to him...many days of travel gave him time to think...oh
no he wouldnt discard the name which was rightful given to him by his
comrade..but more just build on it. In fact his name had already come to
him in his new birth he just saw no need to use it while uncomplete as it
was. It bothered him not...he could tell he was but a few steps away from
his home and nothing would dare bother his gateway there. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He ducked into an alley way and headed to the back his body concealed
in charcole black robe he picked up from a few scavengers along the way.
At the end of the alley was a brick wall standing even with the tavern and
weapon shop of it stood between...he paced his steps in a magical song he
went over in his head, and just before running head first into the wall he
reached forth his arms palms together and spread them open as if walking
through a curtain opening, the wall split and a portal oval in shape and
green in color opened up as he passed through, once through the portal closed
again and disappeared as it was never there. He knew how it was there, why
it was there, and how to open it, but in a way he didnt know, it was no matter
his home was just ahead.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The scene was more then he ever remembered, beautiful and glorious, but
something didnt feel quite right...something was wrong, something felt empty.
He had only a short distance to travel before reaching the primeter of the
Aerie and of course he would be kindly greeted by the local guards, he laughed,
yes kindly greeted that's a way of putting it. No matter he was home those
situations would have to be dealt with as they came. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>As suspected at the entrance to the grand hall stood a few guards...usually,
or he would assume, there would be more but something was amiss from all
this something he couldnt place at the time....</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The guards looked at the stranger then looked again before persuing..."Who
wishes to enter the aerie grandhall, identify yourself for passage beyond
these doors."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Zevinox grinned a half cocked grin as his answer passed through his lips
like his breath..."I am Bistehln Javhyri de' Zevinox, decendant of the Zevinox.
I am home send a message to Shivrehel Despana that I have arrived, he will
sort this matter. In the meantime I shall have a look around unless you think
one man is capable of bringing down the entire aerie by himself." he
laughed...then sighed a moment. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The gaurds looked at one another in confusion thinking this man to be
rather cocky...."We will send word to the lord, you may pass as a guest of
the aerie."</I>
