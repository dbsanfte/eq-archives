	      <I>Ranna was found in&nbsp;the grand city of Qeynos. &nbsp;She was left
	      at&nbsp;the Temple of&nbsp;Life as a&nbsp;baby. &nbsp;With no parents, she
	      was raises as a disciple of Rodcet Nife, listening to the preachings of high
	      ranking members of the church day and night. &nbsp;She knows most of the
	      priests and priestesses rather well, and follows the rules of Rodcet Nife,
	      the prime healer... save for one thing; she's a tad violent.</I></TD>

	<I>Her home is constantly under attack by gnolls, from the scrawny pups to
	the powerful adults. &nbsp;Indeed, even as a child in the temple she had
	problems with these humanoid dogs attacking her. &nbsp;If it wasn't for her
	fellow clerics, she might not have survived to this day. &nbsp;These trials
	have left a mark upon Ranna. &nbsp;She despises gnolls and gladly walks to
	the area of Blackburrow and either slays the gnolls there or heals and assists
	in any way those that attack them.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Also, as a Cleric of Rodcet Nife, she fights the minions of Bertoxxilous--the
	undead and the diseased to the best of her ability. &nbsp;But despite her
	aggressive side, she's a good friend to have. &nbsp;No matter the race (ask
	Amorsaylnn) she will be a friend to all. &nbsp;Amorsaylnn, Tier'dal Magician,
	noted "You're a good sniper!" when Ranna called down the power of Nife to
	smite the gnolls they were chasing.</I>
