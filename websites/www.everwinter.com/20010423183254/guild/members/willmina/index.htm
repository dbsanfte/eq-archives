	      <I>With gentle urgings of Dirge, I've taken time from adventure to put down
	      my beginnings on parchment for the guild's archive. Why he'd want to hear
	      about my meager start still baffles me, but committed I am, so read on, dear
	      reader, and try not to drool on the pages as ye nap, it will smear the ink!</I></TD>

	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>My beginnings are unknown to me. For, you see, I was raised as an orphan
	in the City of Qeynos, daughter of none. Those kind folk who ran the place
	knew nothing of my past, except that I was dropped of in a basket of fine
	woven rush, swaddled in the skin of a bear cub. Some of my elders speculated
	that it was made in the northern city of Halas, but others think it came
	from the eastern forests of Felwithe. Back then in my early days I would
	spend many hours wondering of what my parents were like, and who they were,
	hoping they'd come back for me someday. Alas as the years ticked by my mind
	was distracted by other matters, hope turned to despair, despair to grief.
	I do not spend idle time thinking of such things any longer.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Early life for an orphan was hard, but it gave me insight into the ways
	of the world. It was a cruel place, and one rarely came across a kind soul
	in the bustling city. It was so full of corruption and deceit! &nbsp;</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Even now it remains on the verge of chaos. With hair of flame, and attitude
	to match, the elders decided upon a name to fit my nature, Willmina. "Will"
	for willfull of spirit, and "mina" meaning everyone (from some ancient tounge
	it still know not it name), since I was always trying to get those around
	me to listen to my dreams and desires! &nbsp;During these early days, my
	propensity for controlling magic became quite apparent! Once while trying
	to explain my ideas to an elder, I grew angry and had slammed my fist upon
	his desk in spite. The wild magic and anger combined into a ball of fire
	that promptly made a pile of ashes of his poor desk! My belly went empty
	that night for punishment, not to mention sitting was quite painful as well.
	The very next day I found myself being dragged kicking and screaming all
	the way to the guild of mages and wizzards on the south side of town. I had
	been by there before, whilst running errands and had seen them casting their
	spells, and reading old musty books, but paid it no mind at the time.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>The elders sat me in a room alone, and spoke with the casters quitely
	in the room next door. After a litlle while, one the most lovely ladies I've
	ever met came and spoke with me. Yestura was her name, and she asked if I'd
	like to stay with them a while. I was shy at first, leery of the new
	surroundings, but an insatiable curiosity of the magical power they wielded
	made me speak and give my affirmation. The thought of going back to the orphanage
	was unpleasant at best. Besides, I had shown some of this power myself, and
	I began to hope that I too could be like the Lady Yestura someday, and be
	a master of magic!</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Thus began my days as a junior apprentice for the magician's guild.
	&nbsp;Long days of memorizing spells, learning to channel my magic and begin
	to harness its power. I also took up cooking the daily meals for the mages,
	an a part of me today still enjoys the occasional bout of culinary dabbling.
	While still an apprentice, I was out hunting some rats outside of town for
	their whiskers for Lady Yestura, I happened across a wily monk fellow name
	Mott. He was jovial and kind, but fierce when the Vile Darkpaws would attack.
	Never before had I seen such punishment given without blade nor spell! I
	took a liking to him, and him to me, and we made fast friends. As our skills
	increased we began to hunt the hills of Qeynos, coming ever closer to the
	dreaded Black Burrow. He was part of an adventurous guild call the "Conclave
	of the Wyrm". He introduced me to several junior officers, and I was invited
	to join as well. Since Mott seemed happy with them, I decided to follow along
	and adventure with them as well.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>My masters at the magician's guild were pleased with my progress, and
	were happy that I was doing well. By my 10th circle, I had begun to notice
	that Mott was becoming displeased more often for some reason. &nbsp;When
	pressed for further details, he had finally given me the news of the leaders
	of guild we were in was having a separation of ideals, and that a change
	would be coming soon. I had noticed that the upper ranks of the guild were
	unavailable most of the time, and I had little interaction with them up till
	that point. When the news of the splinter faction reached me, I knew that
	I too would follow the new guild. How ironic that I would be travelling through
	Black Burrow to the icy halls of Everfrost, home of our new guild Winterborne,
	at the time of the split to see my good friend Talora. As I sat on an icy
	rock meditating, the snowy white landscape made me feel at peace. Our new
	group was alive, and full of energy. The words of our leader Dirge rang loud
	to my ears as they were the whispers of the Lady Vox herself.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Let me tell you kind reader, that finding out that one is a creation can
	be quite unnerving, especially one that is so easily detected by the device
	in Flutroses' care. Once I had come to peace with the idea, my whole existence
	had suddenly become clear. The orphaning, and the basket from Halas-- all
	pointed to the very fact that I was indeed destined to be part of Winterborne.
	The breath of the dragons live on in my hands of flame.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Now I enter into my 16th circle, and I have mastered yet another level
	of magic. I aspire to be like my friend and mentor Flutrose, a mage of
	extraordinary caliber that ranks high within our guild. She aides me when
	I have questions, and comforts me when I'm down. I look forward to her future
	teachings. Back home in Qeynos, the mages who raised me from a girl, are
	now less eager to sell me their scrolls, since they are busy with other young
	mages. So I must seek out and learn the source of their power on my own.
	From here on I travel across the land, researching magic from all over the
	world. I have traveled the width of Antonica. I have been to the Deserts
	of Ro, sailed to the Ocean of Tears, and tramped through the treaturous Kithicore
	Forrest. Even though it holds many dangers, I am eager to see the rest of
	Norrath, and continue my persuit to become a master magician!</I>
