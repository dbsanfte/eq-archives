<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>A light rain fell on Qeynos, a very light rain. One could sit in the rain
all day and not get wet. It was eerie.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>ShiverHel sat in the rain, meditating, remembering, recovering from his
recent adventures and efforts to bring some organization to the guild.
Reinstating the clan system was a necessary move but having done so brought
back questions. His thoughts returned again to the paladin as they had so
many times in the recent weeks. &#147;Where are you, Johan&#148;, his soul
cried out!</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>~dirge? Canst thee hear me dirge? </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The past ascended Shiver&#146;s consciousness controlling it&#146;s present.
He could see the battle as clearly as he ever had but he had to have missed
something. It always ended the same. Johan defeating the Council&#146;s leading
red, saving her life by preventing her fall to the menacing rocks below.
Then the blinding flash and nothing.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He had to be quick. There must be some unseen presence there!
Searching&#133;. Searching&#133;&#133;There! A figure hidden in the rocks!
It was Manshoon, leader of the Zhentarim. What was he saying?</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;I have you now Graye. I&#146;ve traveled the planes but I have you
now. Your days of interfering are over.&#148; The wizard was holding an ancient
crystal. Shiver had seen it before but thought it long ago destroyed or hidden
away. The Zhent held the &#147;Heart of Dragonkind&#148;, an artifact capable
of capturing the essence of even a first-borne. Again the flash of blinding
light he&#146;d seen each time this visage had played in his mind but this
time&#133; this time knowing the source he was able to keep his focus, able
to see what occurred.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Johan&#146;s sprit was sucked from him. All that was left was the human
shell, the seeming he used almost unendingly, left without means of flight
or defense. Now instead of saving the red the Earl was riding her. Riding
her to their deaths. The red inverted and still the paladin hung on. His
face was expressionless, his eyes vacant and void. The impact was colossal.
As the red landed upon the knight his body was shattered against the coastal
rocks and carried to sea by the stale inland breezes. But how was it Shiver
was hearing the mithril&#146;s voice?</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>~the crystal dirge&#133;. the crystal. Twill nay be enough to merely draw
me soul from it. Unlike most of our kind I was nay hatched. I was born into
that body. My being is so intertwined with it I canst nay be stolen away
from this prison. I must have another body or here I shall remain
forever&#133;&#133;&#133;..</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The voice was gone.</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The dark elf knocked the papers from his desk, furious over the overt
acts of aggression Manshoon had shown. Even worlds away, in the heart of
Qeynos, there was no love lost between dragon-kind and the Zhentarim. But
for the Black Network to make it personal, to take the soul of one of the
Firstborne, to take a friend from him&#151;he would not tolerate it. There
would be a reckoning. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The rush of anger and joy mingled in his designing mind. Find me a body?
A soulless shell, then, like Erondis had become, he thought. But Erondis
would not do. Johan deserved a stronger form. The erudites were not known
for their physical prowess, nor any particular affinity for the gods of weal.
He&#146;d want access to the churches that would sponsor a paladin. Training
was a necessity, even for the most cunning. Rodcet Nife&#146;s Temple of
Life or Karana&#146;s House of Thunder would suit him well enough, providing
the necessities for training, spells and such. Even Zsalshun had managed
to find the good graces of the Prime Healer, but not without undue effort.
He&#146;d need a human body, or perhaps a half-elf. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>There was something to be said about those who possessed elven blood.
They weren&#146;t quite as strong, but nor were they notably weaker than
humans. They were agile and dexterous, and possessed the gift of night-sight.
Any strange behavior would be written off as the differences between human
and Feir&#146;dal upbringing. Yes&#133; a half-elf body would work well,
but it would have to be Winterborne&#133; and then, Shiver would have to
find a way to mimic the mental decline Erondis suffered. The others would
not be comfortable knowing he possessed such knowledge. Controlling Erondis
was one thing, and even that made others uneasy, but to actually inflict
a malfunction on one of Winter&#146;s children&#151;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>But it was worth it, just as the sacrifice Trespare had made to bring
Rianna back to the fold. Shiver hadn&#146;t spent much time with his Queen
since her return, and he regretted it, but it was difficult on him. He really
was a creature meant to be miserable. He had grown accustomed to the weight
of guilt and he still had not answered for it. Eclipse was dead, but the
fact remained&#133; she had been correct. Shiver betrayed his closest friends
for his own gain when he eluded Faluzure. He whispered aloud, "Old habits
die hard, sister."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>And now he risked the patronage of Lady Vox as well as the good graces
of his peers in the House, but he had to settle the debt. He did not understand
happiness beyond the flush of success, nor friendship beyond the advantages
of trust, but he did understand duty&#133; </I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He reached into his dimensional pouch. It was unlike the temporary summoning
of a magician, though if functioned in a similar manner. This device had
been a gift from Amorsaylnn&#146;s father, Makaz. It was a Teir&#146;dal
relic, of sorts. The wards had been re-attuned to him, so he kept his most
valuable possessions tucked away in the null-space. He withdrew a compass,
a Winter compass, but the craftsmanship was much finer than the versions
the rest of the House had access to. It was crafted of mithril, diamond,
and held hands cut of a fist-sized sliver of black sapphire. It wasn&#146;t
just a richly adorned compass&#133; it was *THE* compass, Winter&#146;s
compass.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>How the Lady had come by it, he hand no idea, but she had entrusted it
to him, to use in emergencies when the House&#146;s numbers had dipped. They
had. Melicoras was becoming overwhelmed by the power of Cazic-Thule himself.
Pella chose to part paths from the House, to pursue goals closer to her heart.
More of the same, he thought. There were far too few Winterborne left. Using
the compass was appropriate. He focused, pulling up a mental image of a
half-elf.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>His vision left him momentarily. It readjusted, miles away, on the plains
of Karana. A small group of bandits huddled in an abandoned farm&#151;two
human men, a human woman, a barbarian woman, and a sturdy half-elven man.
Yes, he would do. They spoke of a daring run against a small group that had
fled back to the guard tower, but the guards had been paid well to look the
other way. It was a good slaughter, and they were dining on a veritable feast
bought with their illicit gains. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He hummed softly, drawing on the latent power that slumbered within his
frail Teir&#146;dal body. The Dirge emerged, long quiet, and spread it&#146;s
awful wings, taking flight and soaring across the plains in moments. It came
to perch over the barn, gloom encompassing the bandits&#146; afternoon decadence.
He watched them rise, startled. The cold seeped in, ignoring the season and
Karana&#146;s blessings.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He let his voice sing, deep and sonorous. "Thou brigands, thou ruffian
villains, ye have been called t&#146; serve a higher purpose. Embrace the
darkness, for I shall give thee the freedom ye have always dreamed of&#133;"
As they scattered, looking for the source of the hoary tone, he focused on
the half-elf. "I have special plans for thee, lad&#133; glory ye would never
see with such a limited aspiration. When the Pale Lady comes for thy friends,
do nae fight. It will only prolong their deaths&#133; and thy promotion to
nobility."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He let the Dirge fade, but the frost coated the walls of the barn and
the bandits went about striking up a roaring fire, sharpening their weapons.
The half-elven man shuddered, though the warmth returned. Deep under Qeynos,
Shiver put away the compass. They needed others to call to their ranks, to
be sure, but the most important thing was bring the Earl of Daggerford, the
richest man in Neverwinter, Johan Graye back to the realm of the living&#133;
It was the least he could do.</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The pale lady had been stalking centaurs, the largest of elephants, and
the bird-folk of the southern reaches of Karana. It had been slow progress,
but steady. Sometimes it was quite nice to be alone, the wind in her hair
and her staff clenched tightly. Her daddy-dearest hadn&#146;t been himself
lately, brooding after a few defeats to GrimFeather. He didn&#146;t take
to Norrath well, that much was certain, but she liked the land well enough.
True, the people were as dumb as always, but that was little bother. The
killing was good and the wide-open areas suited her well.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She was working for her 24th order of achievement. The Tribunal in Halas
would reward her with the boon of new spells and that meant more power.
Regeneration, mastery over the spirits of the cheetah, monkey, and ox&#133;
and the power of the frost strike, envenomed breath, and poison storm&#133;
yes, it would be good to have such abilities at her disposal.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She stood, finished with her meditations. In her mind, a voice bloomed.
"Daharil, I have need of thee. A simple task for one of thy skills&#133;
on the western reaches of the plains of Karana."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She smiled. Not very populated, but an adventurous place for a tryst,
nonetheless. "Mmmm&#133; so this means I should wear a little less mail?
I really hate to take off these beautiful bracers, though. Did you see what
Keldore helped me buy?"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"I&#146;m serious, little one. This is important. The fate of Johan Graye
relies upon thy success. There is a barn, not to far from the guard tower
near the second obelisk from the Qeynos Hills&#133; in it are a band of five
raiders, three human, one barbarian, and one half-elf. I need the half-elf
alive and as unwounded as possible. Eliminate the others and dispose of their
bodies."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"They&#146;ll be dead as fast as the spirit of the wolf can carry me.
I&#146;ll let the lions feast on their corpses and burn the bones. Will you
come for the half-elf?"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Aye, I shall come for his soul. I need a clean slate for the Earl&#146;s
consciousness."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She ran towards the stone bridge that crossed the river than marked the
border between the southern and northern reaches of the plains. North and
west she ran, fleet of foot, the wind in her hair. She bit her lip as she
ran. This business about claiming souls wasn&#146;t something she understood.
Killing, yes&#133; that was simple and fun. Whatever her lover had in store
for the half-elf, it would be a thousand times worse than the punishment
she could inflict upon his friends before they died. She almost felt sorry
for him. Almost.</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The fire was still burning when the dark elf slipped from the shadows.
Against the barn, the half-elf was bound, not even struggling. His eyes were
wide with fear. The pale lady was standing next to the flames. Shar kicked
a charred skull back into the pyre, then turned towards the Teir&#146;dal.
"They were a piece of cake, daddy." She held a staff topped by an eye-like
gem easily in one hand. It was a recent gift, one the gnomes of distant Faydark
had provided, through the merchant skills of Keldore. It served her quite
well.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The midnight-blue skin of the dark elf seemed to be an eerie purple in
the glow of the fire. "Excellent, love. This one will do nicely." He poked
the prone half-elf with the skull-topped head of his own staff. "Are thee
ready for liberation, lad?"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>A muffled moan emerged. Shar had bound him well, though Shiver wasn&#146;t
convinced that was a skill she learned on Toril. "I&#146;ll take that as
a yes. Ye have earned the great privilege of serving as the host body for
the finest paladin t&#146; grace my home. Soon, ye will walk through the
Temple of Life as if ye are the very savior of Qeynos. Perhaps ye will be.
This much I know&#133; ye haven&#146;t a choice in the matter." A dull green
haze rose around the hands of the Teir&#146;dal, snaking towards the
half-elf.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>His eyes went wide and he put up a fight, trying desperately to worm away
from the malevolent power of necromancy. Shiver drew upon the feelings Erondis
suffered, the insidious assault upon his identity, and channeled through
the ability to tap life. It wasn&#146;t simple, to be sure, but his power
was growing and he would be able to do things no necromancer on Norrath ever
dreamed of. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The green wrath enveloped the half-elf and he spasmed under the awful
energy. Slowly, his expression of panic slipped to a blank, unseeing gaze.
Shiver let the spell abate. "He&#146;s ready. Would ye mind carrying him
t&#146; the outskirts of Qeynos? If ye hug the hill side, the guards won&#146;t
see thee. Enter the aqueducts through the secret entrance. I&#146;ll help
ye from there and we shall prepare for the return o&#146; the Earl."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The pale lady hoisted the half-elf&#146;s body upon her shoulder. "Should
I leave him bound?"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Nae," Shiver shook his head. "He will put up no more fight. Unbound,
ye can always say ye are bringing him to the Temple of Life for help if a
guard should intercept thee."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She nodded. "Race ya?"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He smiled slightly. "I suspect, even with that dead-weight, ye would win,
but I can use the exercise. Let me know when ye are ready."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She began to cut the ropes with her boot knife. "About ready&#151;" The
Teir&#146;dal was gone. "Damn you!" She heaved the body back upon her broad
shoulders and raced across the plains towards Qeynos. "Cheating your own
daughter!"</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Two days had passed and Shiver was certain the ritual would work. Everything
was set. It was all up to the Earl&#146;s will to free himself. The conduit
between Manshoon&#146;s crystal trap and the mindless body was established.
In the distant Citadel of the Raven, the mage would find his precious network
of black-hearts under a surprise attack by a canny squad of heavily armed
duergar and drow. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Tanner knew every back door to the Citadel from many years ago, almost
a century. Manshoon would have to focus his attention at routing the sudden
vicious attack. The Zhent&#146;s had tangled with the Brokenblades before&#133;
but never with the Brokenblades using the equipment of the Hel Riadaim. Shiver
had brought much to their ranks. They had the talent, he the magic and wealth.
It was a good combination. It was a pity it did not carry over to Norrath,
but he spent a fair amount of time in Toril, too&#133; and on other planes.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>His little abode under Qeynos was guarded by Aulura and Shar. Amorsaylnn
was not far away, and could be called to assist. His own skeletal pet paced
in front of tunnel that led to the depths of the aqueducts. He was on good
terms with the Temple of the Plague-Bringer. He had little to fear from them,
or the guards, for that matter. It was time.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Johan&#133; all is ready. Come join us in Norrath, among the living.
Come to our new House, when we need ye most."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>And he waited.</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Many months had passed since the essence of what had been Johan Graye
had been stolen away. Manshoon had long ago tired of taunting his once most
prized possession. So unlike his usual cold, calculating self, the head of
Toril&#146;s Black Network had rushed madly forward in his quest to destroy
the persistent paladin who so easily thwarted his plans of controlling the
rich trade out of Neverwinter&#146;s highly skilled merchant district. Johan
laughed despite himself. Manshoon had acted more like the brother Asmuth
he slew for such behavior. Oh, it wasn&#146;t only for his rash behavior
that Manshoon had slain his older brother. The power of controlling the Zhentarim
was bait enough. Graye just found it ironic that Asmuth&#146;s grave mistakes
were, for the most part, a frustration response to the mithril&#146;s efforts
against the earlier Zhent leader. Now the little brother, the one without
so much of a callous on his hands, had made a similar mistake.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Manshoon had used the sweat of others to rise to his current station.
Lord Chess, Fzoul Chembryl, Manxam and his beholder brethren, and the dark
nagas had all served as powerful allies, keeping the heat off the younger
Zhent noble, until he had acquired the knowledge and power he needed to take
control. It was during his manipulation of the Cult of the Dragon that he
had learned of the artifact known as &#145;Heart of Dragonkind&#146; and
it&#146;s ability to trap the essence. Without researching it&#146;s full
potential he sought it for the sole purpose of stopping the Earl once and
for all. Once the deed was done he&#146;d spent a few weeks taunting that
he knew to be within, but soon bored of the routine, and placed the crystal
upon a shelf in his office for all to see. The plaque was nice though&#133;
&#147;Here rests the venerable Paladin Johan Graye, Earl of Daggerford, Champion
of Winterfest, Richest Man in Neverwinter, and Last Survivor of the Border
Legion. Let his presence here serve as a reminder to all who would think
of challenging the Zhentarim or their leader Manshoon. &#147;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>What be the secret to controlling a dragon? The creator of the crystal
had known it to be first, attacking the intended in a weakened state, and
second, keeping the intended in that weakened state. Certainly the magics
of the artifact could restrain even an adult but any wyrm of old age or greater
would have to be repeatedly hampered. In his rushed quest to conquer his
nemesis the dark wizard hadn&#146;t taken the time to learn the intricacies
of his new toy. By drawing upon the essence trapped within Manshoon could
have gained powers to rival those of Maskar Wands, the &#145;Blackstaff&#146;,
or perhaps even those of Elminster himself. Instead he had let his prize
sit dormant and unhindered; yet not as dormant as he&#146;d expected.</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Each passing day added to the strengths of Johan. A few months ago the
paladin found he could slip part of his spirit from its trap and travel Toril.
He&#146;d searched for those he&#146;d once called friend to no avail. He&#146;d
combed the expanse of Candlekeep until he&#146;d learned all there was to
know of his prison. And then he&#146;d attempted his escape; an escape that
was beyond him. The Earl pondered his plight. Why was it he couldn&#146;t
achieve what all sources reported he should be able to. He had to consider
his own origins and existence before he he could form a theory. Having been
born into human form separated Johan from the norm of what was dragonkind.
His persistent use of that same form, despite having any available to him,
bound him closer to it. Perhaps with it&#146;s destruction the Earl could
not even call upon the splendid mithril being of his heritage to reunite
his essence with the world outside his cell.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Plane travel still beyond him the paladin retreated within his confine
and drew. He drew upon the dim light that danced off the crystal&#146;s surface,
he drew upon the hatred that inhabited the Citadel of the Raven, and he drew
upon the very life forces of those that passed his way. Power! It all boilded
down to power and he needed more to overcome the hopelessness he felt. Aye,
there had been times in his life that he&#146;d had to depend upon others
but never for his own sake. His brethren had defended his home, his wife,
and his newborn daughter, but his own personal safety had been his own
responsibility. He prided himself in the fact that his faith, his determination,
his courage, and his passion for justice had not only saw him through every
trial but lent him the means to positively affect the lives of those not
only under his charge, but anyone around him. For the first time, since the
dawn of time, he was in need.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>It took little effort with his growing presence to find the powerful dark
song, to ride its wake to the plane of Norrath. &#147;dirge? Canst thee hear
me dirge?&#148; He&#146;d made his plea and somehow felt it had been heard.
He sensed Shiver&#146;s puzzlement, was he dreaming, was he concocting some
fantasy to still his own grief over the paladin&#146;s loss, or was this
place called Norrath he was still growing accustomed to playing a sick trick
on him? &#147;the crystal dirge&#133;. the crystal. Twill nay be enough to
merely draw me soul from it. Unlike most of our kind I was nay hatched. I
was born into that body. My being is so intertwined with it I canst nay be
stolen away from this prison. I must have another body or here I shall remain
forever&#148;</I>

<I><FONT COLOR="#8080ff">Posted by Johan Graye on July 6, 2000:</FONT></I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Again, the paladin began to draw from any source around him but now with
greater urgency. Yet his soul was troubled. What had he asked of his old
friend? Surely nothing that would turn dirge&#146;s stomach but what of his
own? The deep was capable of nearly anything. Could Graye live with the
result.</I>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<I><IMG WIDTH="510" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="Middle" BORDER="0" SRC="bar.gif"></I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Lost in his schemes, the heartless Manshoon sat at his desk. The gold
runes sewn into the long black cape that draped his body began to fade. His
brow sank low over his eyes and the mage felt exhausted. He was growing edgy,
a bit nervous, and more that a little jumpy when the heavy oaken door to
his office burst open. &#147;It&#146;s the Brokenblades&#148;, screamed the
messenger! The thin, stringy haired, half-orc was pale from fright.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>So startled was the Black Network&#146;s head by the intrusion that he
tipped his chair backward depositing himself squarely upon his back into
the floor. The messenger nervously stared at the slick leather soles of his
master&#146;s boots which peered over the desk at him. Manshoon was furious
as he unceremoniously made his way to his weary feet. &#147;How dare you&#148;,
he bellowed at the intruder. The messenger attempted to interject a feeble
&#147;but sir&#148; to no avail. &#147;We&#146;ve dispatched them before.
Most of their tunnels should be blocked. They are certainly bottled up in
what few we&#146;ve missed.&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>~ &#147;Johan&#133; all is ready. Come join us in Norrath, among the living.
Come to our new House, when we need ye most&#148;. The voice was that of
dirge, full of longing, pain, and a bit of apprehension? Graye began to draw
with all his might. Now was the time. If he were to escape, to ever see his
friends and comrades again, he had to make his attempt now.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;No sire, they are coming from everywhere&#148;, responded the frightened
voice, already feeling drained as something pulled at his life energy. &#147;And
all reports indicate that they&#146;ve weapons of great power. Those dark
marauders are slicing through our guards like a Frostbrand through

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The Zhent&#146;s anger boiled from his very depths as he lashed out at
the man before him. &#147;Incompetent fools&#148;, he raged! Thumb to thumb
he directed the narrow jet of searing flame toward this bearer of bad tidings.
&#147;I&#146;ll take care of the Brokenblades, but not before I take care
of you!&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The flames sprang forth with steely accuracy only to arc, turn, and be
absorbed into the crystal shelved on the office&#146;s western wall. The
Earl&#146;s prison glowed from within, drenching the room with the force
light of the essence held inside, and causing both Manshoon and the spared
messenger to feel weaker in it&#146;s presence. &#147;What was that?&#148;,
inquired the frazzled orc as his leader reached for a greasy mail pouch.
&#147;I&#146;ll deal with this later&#148;, came the answer as Asmuth&#146;s
usurper covered the crystal. &#147;First we must stop this raid.&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>As he departed for the battle ahead Manshoon noted neither that the runes
which once proudly graced his cloak were vanished or that the mailbag was
smoldering near flame.</I>

<I>In a secret passage inside the Citadel of the Raven, moments before the
attack --</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He didn&#146;t look it, but Tanner was happy to be back near the Moonsea.
Yeah, Halas was nice enough to visit, but he spent what little time he had
on Norrath in the western reaches of the Karanas. Ultimately, he was a lot
better suited for Toril&#133; and for this little job. He&#146;d been itching
to take on the Citadel for some time, though this was more of a diversion
from what Dirge had said&#133; a bit of hit and run to keep Manshoon away
from something or another.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The huge mutant duergar knew the Citadel well, better than the denizens.
He had been there in 1276 Dale Reckoning when the combined forces of the
north rebuilt the crumbling Citadel. He was granted a leave from the Black
Daggers to oversee the undertunnels. He had his doubts about Manshoon even
then&#133; and elected to keep knowledge of certain secret passages to himself.
He warded them with various glyphs attuned to his own passage. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>When Dirge told him about the needed distraction, he sent Parne and one
of Dirge&#146;s recruits, Equelle, some sort of planar assassin. They found
the glyphs intact. The passages had remained undiscovered for almost a hundred
years, but that didn&#146;t surprise Tanner. It took a very keen dwarf to
find those routes. There weren&#146;t many dwarves in the Black Network,
and he didn&#146;t know of a single duergar.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He assembled his team quickly, choosing a small but exceedingly talented
group. Now that his Broken Blades had moved to Dirge&#146;s tower, their
numbers were smaller, but they were nothing less than amazing in what they
could do, particularly backed by the magical gear the dark elf had gathered
over the years and a few of his own vassals.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>As always, he wanted his wife at his side. Saphrael wasn&#146;t a gnome
on Toril, or any of the other planes they had traveled to, save Norrath.
On Toril, she was a fine figure of an elven woman, strong, fast, and exceedingly
talented in the art of lighting and chromatic magics. To be honest, he had
no wish to tangle with the war wizard. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He chose from among his most trusted and accomplished followers&#133;
one of his own charges&#151;Iceblood, a bladeling follower of Hriste. Llister
the archer and Hornet a pixie archer in his training were easy choices. Jasper
wouldn&#146;t have taken no for an answer and having the cold-blooded sword
maiden with him was always reassuring, plus she chose the twin duergar Kalos
and Kalorra to accompany her. Tarka was itching for action and the hobgoblin
was no slouch in a fight, plus he chose Ghaela the dwarven skald to deflect
hostile magic, as well as Borandor the arctic dwarf warrior. Parne the ogre-magi
would be their scout and two of his charges&#133; Equelle and Frostclaw a
bladeling assassin, were being sent by Dirge. Helcaraxe the priest of fire
decided to come along to lend his smoldering touch to the fray.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Dirge had requested Cade and Threnody accompany the Blades. Cade chose
two of the shape-shifting dark elven guards of Dirge&#146;s to accompany
him and Threnody, the new servant of Dirge, could summon five of her "thorns"
at will. Tanner didn&#146;t much care for the Thorns. They looked like dark
elves, but he was told they were the shape-shifted forms of some sort of
bat-like creature from the Abyss. It didn&#146;t much matter, though.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>All in all, only twenty-four would make the attack on the Citadel, but
there was a reason. Tanner wasn&#146;t planning on taking the Citadel, only
drawing Manshoon away from the crystal that held Dirge&#146;s friend. The
Zhent warriors stood little chance against the veteran group. Any one of
his men could take three or four of the opponents without magic. With the
Hel Riadaim armor, a plethora of scrolls and potions, and such, it would
be a slaughter. He hoped to destroy no less that two hundred of the Black
Network before he retreated. More would die in the passage. Esteven, servant
of the Red Knight, had seen to layering the two passages with a plethora
of glyphs, runes, wards and such. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Crouching in the lead, the seven feet tall gray-skinned brute called on
his Dark Birds and the ice. Two massive cleaver-like blades appeared, manifesting
as black, ice-like substance, one in each hand. His heavily tattooed skin
sprouted spikes, some a foot long, formed of the same arcane ice. He smiled
slightly, leaning against the false wall that would open into a supply depot.
"Okay, folks, lets have a bit o&#146; fun at the Zhents expense. Saphrael
hovered behind him and Jasper and Tarka took up position on either side.
Cade was a few steps behind, followed by the rest of the motley group. "Into
the breech on the count of ten."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He counted, pushed the wall from it&#146;s concealed hinges, then brought
Hel to the Black Network.</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>A few hours later &#150; in the Dark Song Spire &#150;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Esteven Khenistar was a student of tactics, but he hated to see anyone
suffer. The thin, human man wore a suit of half-plate, gleaming mithril and
wore an under-cote of crimson. His hair was cropped short and his head topped
by a mithril skull-cap. He carried an ornate mace before him as if it was
a relic&#133; and it nearly was. The raid had gone well and there were no
casualties among the Blades, but many bore serious wounds. He touched the
mace to each, in turn, and their flesh knitted itself back together. Such
was the power Essa possessed.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She whispered to him and, as always, only he could hear. "Some of those
souls are foul, Esteven. I even sense the corruption of the Abyss on some."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He sighed and willed a thought to her. "True, some hail from dark places
and even still dream of evil, but they are steered to order, that order guided
by Tanner and the Dirge. I hope to temper their hearts in time."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He felt a warmth about him as he proceeded to the conference room. "I
know you do, my dearest love. You are the reason I am here and helping the
Dark Song make his way."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Esteven knew all too well. Essa, now trapped in the form of a holy mace,
had been a celestial in service of the Platinum Dragon, Bahumut. They met
on battle-scarred cubes of Acheron. She was banished for her burgeoning love
for the human and while she could once change her shape at whim, she was
forever a weapon&#133; but in good hands, she believed.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Esteven felt the guilt heavily. He didn&#146;t understand her banishment.
He could forgive an orc it&#146;s lust for battle or a dwarf his greed, but
how could he forgive the elder dragon that called himself a god? Essa was
the purest woman he had ever met, the only one he could love. Her curse was
beyond even the considerable powers of the dark elf visionary. He held the
mace tightly, sitting down between the cloaked form of Angarakk and the venerable
dwarven sharp-shooter, Gustavus. The other officers filled the room&#133;
Llister, Jasper, Tarka, Parne, Blue the pirate, and Tanner at the head of
the table, flanked by Troken&#146;ther the dark elven priestess that assisted
Dirge directly and the lady, Saphrael,</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He spoke and Esteven, his adopted half-brother, listened. "Okay, people.
Everything went well. Hornet did a body count during our retreat. Looks like
we racked up nearly two-hundred kills, which was what we were shootin&#146;
for. We got one of them priests o&#146; Cyric, plus two magelings thanks
to a well timed fireball from &#145;Elcar. Best news&#133; we didn&#146;t
have t&#146; use the other passage I left behind. Yeah, they might find it&#133;
but at the moment, it&#146;s another backdoor we can use."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He turned to face Troken&#146;ther. "Any news from Dirge, yet?"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She shook her white tresses in negation. "Not yet, m&#146;lord, though
I hope to hear from him soon. I have sent Threnody off to meet him in Norrath
to exchange information."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The big dwarf nodded, cracking a huge grin. "Well, &#145;til then, we
all deserve some relaxation. We&#146;ll be shiftin&#146; to the Outlands
for some trade with the Tuatha soon, unless we have t&#146; go back to the
Citadel. Should be routine for the next month or so. Enjoy it while it
lasts&#133; the road gets way too rocky more often than not. Dismissed."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Esteven rose and made his way back to his quarters. Essa was quiet for
a few moments, uncomfortable in the godless Spire, but began talking when
they returned to his suite. "My love, would you ask when we next plan on
seeing the nether lands? Though it might sound blood-thirsty, I crave the
feeling of ridding the planes of corruption. Many of those warriors that
were slain today... they were simply soldiers, performing their duty, though
I do take comfort in the death of a servant of Cyric."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Esteven sat at his desk, propping Essa on a stand he had the smiths design
for her. "Of course. I will talk to Tanner at dinner. I&#146;m certain it
won&#146;t be long before we face tanar&#146;ri again. Such is the price
of being a mercenary, at least part of the time."</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The magical conduit was in place. Johan had felt it for several days now.
As the fire burned in Manshoon&#146;s office it continued to fuel the growing
power of the mithral&#146;s essence. Graye was ready for the journey. At
least as ready as he&#146;d ever be. Many moral and ethical questions still
plagued him but he had to push those thoughts from his mind. He had to focus
on traversing the conduit, center his thoughts on rejoining his friends,
and deal with the consequences later.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>So it began. The battle within the citadel raging, the master of the keep
distracted, this could be his only opportunity. The Earl cleared his mind
and concentrated on the window Shiver had provided. He imagined the conduit
as a road and simply stepped upon it. He imagined himself with wheels and
sails and captured the winds of change which would carry him to the next
step in his existence. It was the sudden stop at the end of the road which
caught him by surprise.</I>
<P ALIGN=Center>
<I><IMG SRC="bar.gif" WIDTH="510" HEIGHT="19" BORDER="0" ALIGN="Middle"></I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The dark elf watched and waited. Like the others he&#146;d seen the vacant
body of their half-elven victim shudder but there had been no indication
of cognitive process since. He looked at the tall barbarian shaman that had
helped make this all possible. Shar was obviously growing impatient. The
perspiration was collecting in the links of her mail coif and her staff had
taken on an unconscious rhythmic tapping against the cold stone floor of
the hidden chamber beneath Qeynos. The noise was getting to the hidden Aulura
but Shiver seemed unaffected by it. He simply stood waiting, motionless save
the occasional rise and fall of the black robe in unison with his breathing.
The respirations came so infrequently and were so shallow that even that
wouldn&#146;t have been detectible had it not been for the ornate coloring
across the robe&#146;s front. No perspiration graced his midnight blue skin.
Nor did any emotion banish the usual serious sternness of his expression.
He just waited confident in his own preparations and in the will of his old
friend.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Suddenly the bound figure before them gasped and let out an agonizing
scream. It&#146;s eyes opened and began to look about. &#147;Why hath thee
bound me so Shiver?&#148; Finally, some sign of life. And not just from the
Earl but Shiver as well. Had Shar not been pulling a dagger to cut the ropes
holding the half-elf down she might have seen the slightest crease of a smile
briefly cross the lips of her father.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The captive struggled in the grasp of the red-tunic wearing assailant.
She couldn&#146;t help but laugh. &#147;It&#146;s me, Earl. Shar!&#148; He
stopped repelling the advance and returned the barbarian&#146;s embrace.
He was about to speak when Shiver interrupted. &#147;A moment little one,
please. Who are you that caresses my daughter&#148;, he directed toward the
Earl.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Graye was shocked and for several reasons. Shiver never seemed to concern
himself much with Shar&#146;s personal life but more startling was that he
knew who it was. &#147;Calm thyself old friend. Thou doth know it to be me
and that no harm be meant by greeting a sister after so long an
absence.&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;I asked you a question&#148;, scowled the dark elf. &#147;What is
your name?&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;This is becoming a bit trying Shiv. Thou doth know it to be me,
Jerhan. I mean Jerhan. No Jeeerrrrhan.&#148; The paladin gave up his attempt
with a look of both puzzlement and disguist. Yet Shiver seemed not surprised.
&#147;I feared this. Part of the former inhabitant of thy shell tenaciously
holds on. Perhaps nothing. But at the least it clings to it&#146;s identity
by interjecting an &#145;er&#146; over the &#145;o&#146; of thy own
name.&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;What hast thou done ShiverHel! What hast thou done to me! What hast
thou done to he to which this body belongs?&#148; Graye was more grieved
by what could have befallen Shiver&#146;s victim as he was angered.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;Nothing to concern yourself with Lord Graye. I WOULD have done anything,
and I DO mean anything. Regardless of the price I was determined to have
you back among us.&#148; The nasty scowl returned to Shiver&#146;s face.
&#147;Would you prefer to be a trapped toy for the Zhentarim? Besides, someone
would have killed that bandit for bounty before long anyway.&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Shiver was right thought the paladin. He was elated to be free of
Manshoon&#146;s trap. Graye began to inspect himself. The hands were more
unfamiliar than he thought they would be. Somehow human and somehow not.
The scent of stale ale and soiled straw reached his nostrils as he searched
the room for a mirror. Wait a minute! &#147;Didst thee say &#145;Bandit&#146;?
Bandit? Thou didst place me within a bandit deep one?&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>A laugh erupted from the dark elf. &#147;My dear Johan. I could have chosen
a troll&#148;, he smirked handing a mirror to his friend. &#147;I chose a
half-elf for several reasons. For starters your old eyes often failed ye
on starless nights. Then this is also a human town in which we reside. Half
elves are seldom missed. Their human parent frequently a rapist and their
elven disgraced if word of her child becomes known to her people. I made
a reasonable choice.&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>&#147;I suppose it nay matters&#148;, shrugged the paladin. &#147;I shall
simply shift into a form that suits me more.&#148; Graye seemed to be straining
upon the last few words. He turned to face Shiver. The strain still upon
his brow he pleaded, &#147;What goes on here old friend? Why might I nay
enter the weave? What hast become of us in me absence?&#148;</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The dark elf smiled ever so slightly. "Funny ye should ask that, but first
things first. There have been many changes and the Conclave is no more-least
as ye know it. To tell thee more, I&#146;ll need proof that ye are who ye
say ye are." He motioned to the bardess and Shar. He handed his staff to
Aulura, who smiled slightly, her eyes looking very much reptilian for a moment.
"Daharil, a test is in order&#133; one of faith. Ye do trust me, don&#146;t
ye?"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She smirked, shrugging her shoulders. "Do I have a choice?" </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"We all have choices, little one, but I&#146;d rather nae discuss depth
of those options." His expression hardened a bit. "Trust is very important,
particularly for such a small group as our House. If this is the Earl,
he&#146;ll be a tremendous boon&#133; one that is worthy of trust. I can
probe his thoughts in this weakened form, but I can nae be certain they
haven&#146;t been planted. What I can be certain of is a paladin&#146;s unique
abilities. If this is the Earl, he possesses the ability to lay on hands,
heal without uttering a spell. And if it isn&#146;t, he is still a paladin,
and no such knight is capable of deception. Do ye agree?"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Jerhan-the name the mithril had been forced to adapt to-smiled. Despite
the paranoia, it was obvious the dark elf had spoken the truth. Only paladins
possessed the ability to lay on hands. And any paladin was honest and good.
Though most clergies would be opposed to the acts the deep carried out in
the name of order, they would not stoop to deception. Doing so would quickly
strip them of their divine abilities.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Shar nodded. "I get it. So you want him to do his thing? Prove he&#146;s
a paladin? Who&#146;s the guinea pig?" Terran phrases were still part of
her memory, though her life there was distant and vague-nearly a dream.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Ye are, of course. After all. There are questions of trust all of us
must answer." He removed his dragoon dirk from a sheath at his belt and brought
the blade towards her face. "Careful now&#133; I&#146;d hate to strike an
eye in the name of a test."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>There was a moment of silence as Shiver brought the blade closer to
Shar&#146;s face. &#147;Wait! Let&#146;s think about this first! What if
he isn&#146;t completely the Earl. Ye heard the way he stumbled over his
own name. Shesh, even if he is all there, who&#146;s saying he&#146;s been
granted his paladin powers in Norrath? Have ye seen Saphrael lately? She
ain&#146;t exactly the knock-out elf she used to be. Not to mention she&#146;s
never been able to cast a single spell here. Oh...I don&#146;t like this.
What about Aulura? Can&#146;t ye test this theory out on her?&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Shiver&#146;s hard gaze confirmed that there was more being tested than
the Earl and his healing abilities. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Fine. Make it quick." She bit her lip, defiant. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The pale lady let out a deep sigh and kept her eyes on the Earl as the
knife pierced her cheek. &#147;Let&#146;s hope those magic hands of yours
aren&#146;t too rusty, eh?&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>With an apt slash, her cheek was slit open from near the corner of her
mouth to the bone under her eye. The blood began to flow, trickling down
through her mail and onto her stained mantle and tunic. "Does that make you
happy?"</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Shiver didn&#146;t smile. "Nae, this man proving his ability will." He
turned towards the half-elf. "&#146;Tis thy turn, and then we all sip some
wine I&#146;ve been saving and I tell ye a tale or ten."</I>

<I>Jerhan reached toward Shar&#146;s face and dabbed his finger in the vicious
slash inflected by Shiver&#146;s dagger. He put the blood to his lips and
smiled wickedly. Ah the sweet taste of barbarian blood. Suddenly, in disbelief,
he yanked it away and wiped the finger on the tattered pants he couldn&#146;t
believe he was wearing. A single tear welled up as Graye placed his hand
upon the pale lady&#146;s face. Had Shiver noticed his unexplained pleasure
in the lass&#146;s pain? How would the deep react? Convincing his old friend
that he really was Johan Graye wasn&#146;t going to be an easy task if he
couldn&#146;t control the vile preoccupations of his host. &#147;This is
my body now&#148;, he thought. &#147;I am in control.&#148; But the paladin
had his doubts. He felt powerless on this Norrath and knew the only way he
could truly return to his old self would be to explore this place, learn
of the origins of this bandit he&#146;d replaced, and build his power upon
this land to a point to where his essense replaced that of the rogue.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The blood flow ceased and the laceration began to mend. Glancing at Shiver
Graye knew that the dark elf hadn&#146;t detected any magic. There had been
any. The laying on of hands is a divine gift to paladins regardless of where
they roam. But when the Earl saw the result more tears joined the one trickling
down his cheek. A terrible scar remained shaped as if to form a grin mocking
him. &#147;Ah lass I am sorry. I fear this place nay holds me a prized child
as our last home did.&#148;</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The paladin turned to Shiver, &#147;Doth that satisfy thee deep? I believe

<I>The pale lady touched her cheek absently. The pain subsided, but he was
right, his healing wasn't exact. That didn't precisely bother her. None of
them were as well endowed as they were on the other planes. She was more
intrigued by his actions. "What's this," she thought. "I think he actually
enjoyed watching me bleed."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Without taking her eyes from the Earl, she chimed in, "Yes, a tale..."</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>**Daddy, let's keep a close eye on him. I can tell it's him, but his host
seems to be troubling him. Should he be able to take over completely? Or

<I>"Johan, we should've expected as much. None of us have found this plane
very giving. We don't have the power we once had on Toril and the Blood

should be following up with some words of encouragement. But she couldn't
find any. Lately, she'd been troubled by her own inadequacies and was in
no mood to be placating.</I>
