	    <TD><I>Aneste stepped from the Mists near Usk. Usk was a small village, serving
	      the people of Winter Wold with the necessities of their lives... weapons,
	      armor, food, and even a small chapel. Shar had immediately taken a liking
	      to the place, according to Fallon. It was relatively quiet and the country-side
	      was desolate of all save a few wandering ogres and fenris&#151;a feral breed
	      of large wolves. While Aneste hadn't mastered many magics of the world, she
	      was capable of protecting herself from the few challenges on the path to
	      the Eastern Ogre Caverns, Shar's favorite place to hunt.</I></TD>

	<I>She made good time despite the fresh layer of snow over the path, encountering
	only two ogres. She had quietly avoided them and made her way to the cavern
	mouth. There she waited, protected by a potion of invisibility. It wouldn't
	be long before His daughter would emerge, cheeks blue from exertion and pelts
	slung over her shoulder. </I>

	<I>The pale lady hefted the two-handed sword with ease. The Wrath was perfectly
	weighted, unbeknownst to her. It didn't matter how perfect the blade was.
	By the gods, she never understood those dwarves and their fascination with
	weapons crafting and metals. Bah! All she needed was a good spear, preferably
	the one collecting dust on a shelf in Wen. Now, that was a weapon! There
	was no staunching a wound inflicted by Khelek. Unfortunately, Nature's rules
	in the Realm dictated that the 'Wrath' was the mightiest weapon on the plane,
	especially when it was imbued with certain enchantments, such as the one
	she currently used. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"Thank you, Fallon," Shar said coolly under her breath as she let the
	blade slide across the ogre&#146;s mid-section. Fallon was responsible for
	making Shar&#146;s weapon the ferocious blade that it was. She&#146;d imbued
	it with magic that would inflict additional damage from the elements. Shar
	looked upon the ogre with a satisfied grin. His hide still smoked from the
	reaction to the enchanted sword.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"That makes thirty...not bad for a few hours' work," she chuckled and
	kneeled beside the ogre, drawing a smaller blade, a skinning knife, and set
	to work. It was a shame to leave the heads behind, but since Tanner was the
	only berk she knew who would part with coin for such a prize, she decided
	against the extra effort. Maybe next time, she thought&#133;Unlikely though.
	Shar couldn't see Tanner and Saphrael abandoning their band of groupies on
	Toril for anything. It was strange, the loyalty big brother expressed for
	his mercenary company, it was almost familial. Indeed, Tanner's motley followers
	were more of a family than the Conclave dragons would ever be. The hollow
	feeling the pale lady felt was only momentary and passed quickly. It was
	easier not to dwell on things out of one&#146;s control. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Her melancholy mood quickly dissipated once she emerged from the dank
	caverns. The bright sunlight and brisk air was refreshing. Standing lithely
	next to a tree was a slight figure she recognized immediately. Not unlike
	Dirge, her seeming was deceptively frail. She was the essence of tragic beauty.
	The pale lady knew little about Aneste and cared even less. She was certain
	though, had the creature not endured whatever hardships lay in her past,
	she surely would not be the exquisite beauty that stood before her. There
	was something about pain and loss...but what did she know about that? </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"Aneste! What a lovely surprise. What tears you from Daddy's side on this
	day?" The pale lady shifted the weight on her shoulder. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"It is He that asked me to find you. He wishes you, Jabbuk, and Megera
	to meet him at the Dark Song Spire." </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>The pale lady frowned. It was always business. How completely unthinkable
	it would be to have Aneste fetch her for a romantic rendezvous. Shar sighed
	and offered Aneste her empty arm. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"I think I know the way, but I'd love the company. If ye don't mind, I
	just need to drop these things off at my quarters in Wen and clean up a bit."
	</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>The pale lady winked at Aneste who reluctantly laid her hand lightly on
	Shar's proffered arm.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"Aye, I will escort you back to the tower, m'lady." </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Shar let out a throaty chuckle. "Always the charmer, dark one. Tis no
	wonder he keeps ye around." She spoke a few words of incantation and the
	air around them stirred. In seconds, they were both standing near the hearth
	in the front room of Shar's apartments. "Make yourself at home. Pardon the
	lack of furniture. I've had a hard time finding decent help to move my things.
	What one really needs is some hardy constructs that don't mope about and
	can withstand a beating!" </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>The pale lady turned on her heel and flung open the front door. She stepped
	outside and shrugged the hides off her back and onto the ground. She yelled
	to someone and spoke a few harsh words in some ugly, guttural language. Aneste
	stood, waiting patiently, her arms crossed loosely in front of her. Momentarily,
	Shar returned, slamming the door behind her. Her eyes flashed smiling. Normally,
	her temper would flair at the insolent imps working for her. But today, nothing
	but promises sweetened the air. Aneste could fill her in on the details,
	but it was obvious that something was brewing. The pale lady was itching
	for battle. The ogres were becoming a tried way to pass the time. She was
	anxious for something that lent a little more excitement. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"One more moment, sweet Aneste." She unfastened the breast plate she had
	so begrudgingly donned this morning. Oh, how she hated the necessity of armor
	on this Io forsaken plane! She tossed the rest of her armor in a heap on
	the floor-something else for those useless imps to tend to while she was
	away. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>The gambezon was the next thing to go. One would've thought she'd been
	living with those stinking ogres for months rather than hunting them for
	a mere morning. It wasn&#146;t any wonder Aneste was reticent to get any
	closer. The pale lady shrugged out of the gambezon and tossed that into the
	pile too. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>"You know, there is one saving grace regarding civilization, Aneste? That's
	running water." Shar flashed a smile, teeth as white as her recently bared
	flesh. "Care to scrub my back?" Without waiting for a reply, the pale lady
	walked into the other room. </I>
