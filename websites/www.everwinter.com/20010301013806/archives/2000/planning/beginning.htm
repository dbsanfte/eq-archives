<I>Things had gone quite well for the ranger of Norrath. The start, albeit
rocky, was no unlike the start others had made when they were placed upon
this world. Why curse himself for stupid mistakes that no one told him not
to make? He would always have regrets . . . let it go. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>So he had, for some time. Those of Norrath he had fought with counted
him a brave and noble friend. He'd already made numerous friends, though
none but a few close. No matter. He wasn't here to win popularity, only increase
his knowledge and power. Tunare had guided him, albeit poorly, but he was
sure she was with him. She'd led him down painful roads, but he was sure
she was there . . . she had to be. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>So it had come, Olam had reached the 24th nock of Rangerhood. He'd felt
alive, powerful. The time in the oceans had taught him some things. He'd
kept a watchful eye upon the druid Kimber. Her powerful teleportation magiks
and feral magic had done wonders to keep him alive . . . surely a gift from
Tunare! His friend, Saidaar. Finally settling on the magics of summoning,
stood next to him. All was well. The goblins bled, he bled, they bled. No
matter, it was Tunare's will. So it was when they decided to head for the
haunt of Unrest. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Saidaar, Kimber, and Olam boarded the boat. They chided Kimber for taking
the boat with them. Much to their enjoyment, she continually asked, "Are
we there yet?" The might druid of teleportation, taking a boat trip just
to ease their trip, how amusing, how kind. The oceans were kind, and no storms
washed them from deck. It was fortunate. Olam was about to crack from too
much time in the oceans. Already Saidaar had showed signs of insanity. Without
his stability, it wouldn't be long until Olam succumbed as well. Thus they'd
voted to leave. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The trio entered Unrest quickly, unprepared for the trials that faced
them. Why not? Tunare had protected them before, right? Thus, it was, within
five minutes of entering the keep, that two of the members were cut down.
Olam fought until the sound of Kimber's death cry cut through him. Saidaar
and he sounded the retreat and began the run. Saidaar fell shortly thereafter,
not even making the stairs. The ghouls had rooted him where he stood and
Olam was no match for the mob. Olam was rooted next. It was a miracle then,
that he survived. Oh yes, he survived! He ran with all his might. The root
had removed the feral spirit from him, and he found he was no longer able
to move with the quickness he once had. But Tunare was with him, right? </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>It was then, while resting that the voice entered his head. "I have saved
you once more, Olam, ranger of Norrath." He replied, "Thank you, my goddess,
Tunare." The chuckle was crisp and all too clear, "Ah, you have much to learn,
Olam . . . much to learn. Tunare is no closer to you than you are to the
gods." Olam was startled. He quickly stood up and looked around . . . nothing.
No one was near, save a group of half dead warriors and their healers, making
the cavern look like a triage unit. He thought about asking them "did you
hear that?" but knew better. They were moaning and did not look like they
were in the mood for his ravings. The voice came again, "Vox has saved you
Olam, I know your wyrmsoul is true, do not ignore your true calling." Olam
laughed aloud, breaking the silence of the cavern. His laughter was more
manical then he intended and several looked at him out of the corner of their
eyes. He talked within his mind, careful of any words whispered aloud. **"Vox,
the lady of Winter? Please, Tunare would nae let you out of your cave, yet
alone take credit for my safety, begone!** </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Olam rushed out of the cavern and back to the haunt. He nae needed the
help of a half-forgotton dragon of the North! Please! </I>
