<I>Gods but it had been years since she had been warm or seen any life in
this mist-shrouded realm. Too long, too many whispers of evil, and too damn
many drinks from the skin of old, stale wine on her hip. A shiver shook her
form once again, and she paused in her questing magic to perceive herself
again. Small of stature, but graceful of form, her limbs were still deeply
tanned from a sun too long gone. The leather armor she wore was worn and
patched in places, certainly no suitable cover for who she was. But then
again, who was she? </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I> An elf certainly, that much was apparent from the lilting ears and slightly
slanted eyes that she could feel with her fingers. There was something else,
however, a past and a history she knew was hers, but that did not seem to
come to her calling mind. Great magics were there, sliding and writhing in
a glorious, roiling cascade through her mind. What to use them for? Who knew?
Where was she? </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I> Damn that Black Death that had taken her! Oh yes, she knew what it was
that caused her to be here, in this infernal shadow realm of mists and ghosts
and slavering beasts of evil. The real question was why? And why did she
know only that and nothing else? Sighing softly, she trudged on, in no direction
at all&#133;. </I>
