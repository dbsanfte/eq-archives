	<I>I was born two miles under the Galenas &#145;tween the surface lands of
	Thar and Vaasa. This was way back when the ogre Tharkul ruled the Gray Lands
	and long before the Witch-King. I was the only child of Wulfgrim, the Iron
	Lord of the Red Handed Slayers. Ya heard of &#145;em? No? Well, I guess
	they&#146;re far away from here, so that ain&#146;t yer fault. The Slayers
	are one of the most feared clan o&#146; duergar, or gray dwarves. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>I don&#146;t look like a dwarf? Well, that&#146;s sorta&#146; true. I&#146;m
	only half dwarf, as far as I can tell. I&#146;ve always been big, but mah
	dad&#151;mah real dad&#151;says that&#146;s a common trait among half-dragons.
	Eh? Oh, well I ain&#146;t half-dragon here, mind ya. When I came to Norrath,
	I found myself in this barbarian body&#133; and it ain&#146;t half bad, really.
	Mah wife was an elfie on Toril, and she&#146;s a gnome, here! Imagine our
	surprise! When we go back to Toril or to Sigil, we&#146;re back t&#146; being
	half-dragon and elf lass, respectively, so it must be something about Norrath.
	Ya see Dirge? Half the time he&#146;s a human, half he looks like his usual
	drow&#151;ah, dark elven&#151;self. It&#146;ll take me a bit t&#146; get
	used to this place.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Anyhow, I&#146;m working for Dirge and the House. I&#146;ve been a mercenary
	mah whole life, and I&#146;ll be a tough cutter soon enough here, too. Olam
	gave me this fine blade, and the armor came from Saidar and some from Makaz,
	this dark elven armorer Dirge knows. Back on Toril I was the leader of the
	Broken Blade company, though now we be travelin&#146; with Dirge in his Spire.
	Amazin&#146; thing, that&#133; hops from plane t&#146; plane. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Well, that&#146;s neither here nor there, eh! When I&#146;m on Norrath,
	ye&#146;ll find me helpin&#146; the House, most often in the company of mah
	wife, Saphrael. A few more weeks o&#146; training, and I think our names&#146;ll
	be common knowledge. We&#146;re good at what we do, and quick students. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Hey, know! &nbsp;Get yer coin together... ya owe me a few more rounds.</I>

	<I>Tanner (Tannar in EQ) has a long and detailed history from the Forgotten
	Realms setting. &nbsp;He is the leader of a well established mercenary band
	and information regarding this group and their recent plane-hopping adventures
	can be found online in the Edge of&nbsp;Winter project (scheduled to go online
	in the next few months).</I>
