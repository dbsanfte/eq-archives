	      <I>The day of rebirth arrived, and Weab was scarcely able to contain his
	      joy - while the rebirth signifies a great road of pain for the future, with
	      it comes promise of grand adventures and great fame.</I>
	      <P ALIGN=Center>
	      <I>Admittedly, Weab is not your ordinary Iksar - while most Iksar have contempt
	      for the so-called 'soft skins,' Weab has some strange fascination with them.
	      Their culture intrigues him greatly, and he longs to one day convince the
	      other races that he is not like the ordinary Iksar, that he might be able
	      to walk among them to better study them and understand their way of life.</I></TD>

	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Not only the way of life of the softskins, but also their fighting techniques,
	the nature of their magicks, and the values and intricacies of their trade
	skills. &nbsp;The other 'evil' races especially interested him - he wanted
	to know why the trolls and ogres were unaccepted like him. Another special
	interest of Weab's was the fighting styles of the Iksar monks' human
	counterparts, the monks of Qeynos and Freeport.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>It was then that Weab fully understood what the rebirth meant to him and
	what the Shackle signified. The Shackle stood for determination, and while
	most Iksar thought of determination to continue in a Monk's training, in
	Weab's mind it was a reminder that someday, no matter how far in the future,
	he would be strong enough to do deeds the 'soft skins' would accept him
	for.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>With newfound courage and energy, Weab moved to the Field of Bone. He
	saw before him limitless opportunities.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>After experiencing the basics of combat hunting scaled wolf pups and other
	small game, Weab felt prepared to move to the pit. All was well, when he
	encountered a strange softskin, one half his size. He spent a good deal of
	time studying the small creature, trying to decide how and why it could possibly
	be here. With such small arms and (apparently) weak muscles, there was no
	way it could face even a skeleton, let alone one of the feared scaled wolf
	hunters.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Yet Weab was soon to be given an important lesson. The creature ran into
	the battlefield, and provoked about six deadly creatures into attacking him
	all at once. Being an abnormally sensitive Iksar, Weab shielded his eyes
	from what was sure to be a slaughter. After a few seconds, however, Weab's
	curiosity got the better of him. He peaked through his scaley fingers to
	see the softskin not only alive, but decimating the creatures before him.
	Four were already dead, and the other two were severely wounded.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Later he learned the creature was called a 'halfling,' and that although
	they are naturally small, they can become as powerful as some of the most
	legendary Iksar.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>This knowledge only strengthened Weab's interest in pursuing his goal
	- becoming accepted on the distant continent of Norrath.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>As he peered into the night sky, he knew a long path lay before him, one
	he was most eager to walk down. As dawn arrived, he walked to the Field of
	Bone once more, to resume his training and reach his goal.</I>
