	      <I>Sir Johan found his way to the city of Neverwinter ((on AOL, in 1993)).
	      After a few days in the city he joined the guild known as the Border Legion,
	      was granted the title of Earl and promoted to the position of Ambassador.
	      Few who visited Neverwinter would not recall the Earl. He could always be
	      found in the square assisting newcomers or leading them on quests. His courtship
	      of Melody brought much attention to her newly formed guild and their wedding
	      ceremony is remembered by many to this day. ((I can't recall ever attending
	      a wedding in NW that was so crowded or caused so much headache with traffic
	      control. But the reception was well orchestrated and went off without a hitch
	      unless you count Melody punting while receiving her wedding gifts and loosing
	      a Pearl Item!))</I></TD>

	<I>((In 1996)) After the Guild Master of Border Legion went missing, Graye
	helped to reform the Fighting First with another veteran Neverwinter presence
	and served as the Assistant Guild Master (AGM). But the First soon faltered
	as well, due to a guild master who had more ambition than time. Several members
	had encouraged the Earl to take over the leadership, just as they had the
	Legion, but he again declined. He just never could see himself as leading
	any group not strictly paladin in makeup and even considered starting such
	a guild. However, his strong ties to the Council of Wyrms, Melody's guild,
	led him to join them instead.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Johan had met the first the Council&#146;s Guild Master when the wyrm
	first arrived in Neverwinter. The fledgling had joined the Jedi Clan, allies
	of the Border, so too was an alliance formed with CW when it was formed.
	An instant attraction grew between Melody and Johan. The paladin assisted
	the guild and it's young members, participated in their events, and visited
	their guild hall often.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>One trait that Johan has always exhibited is that of loyalty. Loyalty
	prevented him from usurping control of the Border Legion. And loyalty has
	held him to serve his guild, despite a radical change in leadership. When
	Neverwinter faltered and the Council of Wyrms left for the web, Graye followed.
	He followed to the Realm&#153;. He followed to UO&#153; and was instrumental
	in helping the guild establish a tower, blacksmith shop and training huts
	there. Strong friend-ships have formed along this journey. Even un-paladin-like
	friendships with those of lesser reputations such as Shiver Hel. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Shiver was concerned about the goals of CW and chose to form a new group,
	a more tight-knit and group dedicated to the welfare of each other. This
	new guild is named Winterborne, in tribute to Neverwinter where the founding
	members came together. The Earl is of the opinion that Shiver was CW. Despite
	their characters differing outlooks on life the players share the same underlying
	principles about gaming and roleplay. So, after an unavoidable, extended
	absence from gaming, Johan will follow his friends to Norrath ie.
	Everquest.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I>Johan can be found in a half-elven form, still persuing the life of a
	paladin. &nbsp;He is known as Jerhan Graye in Norrath, and has recently achieved
	the 22nd order of the Knights of Thunder.</I>
