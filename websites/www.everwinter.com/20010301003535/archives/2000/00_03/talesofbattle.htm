<I>Shiver smiled softly to himself, a malicious grin full of spite and hatred
for that which he was sworn to protect. The lion was a big specimen of his
kind, one of the highland breeds. It was suitable for his training, and that
was all that mattered to the false druid. He drew the anima about while crouching
down in the high weeds. The flora around the lion wrapped itself around the
creature&#146;s paws. The snaring enchantment did not stop the creature from
bounding forward, but it slowed it and the advantage of speed was all Shiver
needed.<BR>
<BR>
He quickly summoned a swarm of insects that manifested around the beast,
a whir of wings and snapping mandibles. Individually, they weren&#146;t much
more than a nuisance&#133; but in number they could tear flesh from bone
at a terrifying rate. The lion lunged forward, enraged at the human, though
Shiver wasn&#146;t certain how the creature had known the enchantments originated
from his direction. He turned, using the spirit of the wolf that was instilled
in him to quickly leave the snared lion a fair pace behind.<BR>
<BR>
When the margin had widened, Shiver turned and concentrated. The anima swelled
up within him quickly and he called in the name of fire. The lion&#146;s
skin ignited in a burst, but still it came, albeit slowly. Another blast
of fire followed, but the lion was nearing the false druid and he disdained
combat when magic was to be employed. He focused and a dense array of thorns
sprouted from his skin. The effect wasn&#146;t precisely pleasing to the
eye, but the lion would soon find his bites came at a fierce cost. Shiver
tightened his grip on the Runed Totem staff he held and waited.<BR>
<BR>
The lion, though wounded from the fire and insects was still a powerful creature.
Several exchanges made it clear to Shiver such a pursuit was best left for
warriors. He waited until the creature lunged, then began summoning the anima
to him. A loud clap of thunder boomed around him, the Will of Karana, and
the lion turned and ran across the plains, though slowly. The snare still
held. <BR>
<BR>
Following at his heels, Shiver snapped his staff down into the lion&#146;s
back. The strength of earth that imbued him with a power beyond the grasp
of many humans had good effect. He heard the lion&#146;s ribs snap and smiled
at the roar of pain and fear. Finally, the creature turned back, but it was
a bloody mess, the skin torn horribly, burnt in great patches. It struck
fiercely, fangs penetrating Shiver&#146;s leather greaves, damaging his
skin&#151;skin he had enchanted to have the resiliency of rock. Irritated,
he invoked a final blast of fire. The lion, pride of the highlands, dropped
to the ground, smoldering.<BR>
<BR>
Shiver grinned. Dhirge, humble servant of Karana, was a means to an end.
That end was the ability to move from druid circle to druid circle at whim.
He shifted into the form of a tree, ignored the griffon-spawn and giants
that wandered the northern reaches of the plains named in his misled God&#146;s
honor. He concentrated, regaining the magical energy the natives of the plane
called mana, and allowing his wounds to mesh. <BR>
<BR>
OOC: Just a description of a druid&#146;s battle against a Highland lion
using rather standard tactics and a bit of kiting. Spells used were Snare,
Stinging Swarm, Ignite, Shield of Thistles, and Panic Animal, more or less
in that order. Buffs mentioned were Spirit of the Wolf, Strength of Earth,
and Skin Like Rock. </I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Keldore laughed at his son Jaidon, who was grumbling about a recent death
in the Qeynos Hills as they ate a dinner of lion steak and steamed vegetables
in the Lion's Mane Inn. "That isn't death. I've got a story for you about
death."<BR>
<BR>
After taking a long sip of an unnamed red wine, Keldore began telling the
tale of his latest hunting trip. "Fire erupted from my hands and over the
minotaur. The fur covering its head and back blackened. Following the scorching,
two powerful blades, wielded by two powerful troll brothers, began hacking
away at the bullman." <BR>
<BR>
"That would be Chudd and Krudd, I suspect?" Jaidon interrupted, the dark
elf shrouded in a half-elven illusion.<BR>
<BR>
"Aye. Very powerful allies to have. Anyway..."<BR>
<BR>
He continued, "Shar flung her own magic and muscle at the beast as well,
and the spear wielding water elemental of Amorsaylnn only quicked death."
He took a bite of the tender meat and continued as he chewed. "Zsalshun was
also close at hand to offer clerical aid to the hunting party in the deep
gorge through the Runny Eye Mountains."<BR>
<BR>
"In short order, the minotaur was dead and another valuable axe was ours.
We were enjoying ourselves greatly--that sequence continuing until the Temple
in the Gorge was filled with dead bullmen."<BR>
<BR>
"I thought you said this story was about your own death?" Jaidon eyed up
his father.<BR>
<BR>
"I'm getting there, I'm getting there. By the way, *I* didn't die, I escaped
of course...just let me continue."<BR>
<BR>
"The Temple is also home to a few evil eyes and their lords. They gave us
little trouble, aside from the occasional charming of one of the trolls who
was then easily dispelled. They were a welcome variety to the minotaurs.
One of the lords also kept attacking us, but he was quickly dispatched
repeatedly."<BR>
<BR>
"A few hours into the hunting, an evil eye appeared on the monolith in the
temple. I cannot recall his name at the present, but he looked far more powerful
than the other eyes. We didn't think anything of that, however, and so we
launched an attack. It was a disaster. Krudd died very quickly, and Chudd
followed, I ran and the others were forced to teleport themselves out of
the gorge. Unfortunately, Shar was beset upon my muddites and slain as
well."<BR>
<BR>
"Why didn't you destroy the evil eye with your magic, O Great Wizard?" Jaidon
grinned, tossing back the last of his wine and refilling the glass with the
bottle on the table.<BR>
<BR>
"He had a powerful resistence to most of my spells, and Amorsaylnn's," Keldore
explained.<BR>
<BR>
"Bah! That's why you should always have an enchanter with you. You know we
have ways to get around those obstacles. Mother is right, you are getting
old!"<BR>
<BR>
Keldore muttered to himself about such an insolent child, but before getting
into an argument over why he did not have an enchanter with them, he eventually
just laughed at his son, "At least I can kill a puppy without dying!" It
was after this that Keldore got a full glass of wine poured over his
head.<BR>
<BR>
OOC: It was a great time in the gorge, even though once Krudd left an evil
eye fell on top of me and saw through my invis and killed me, and I summarily
lost half the morning's exp. oh well, I'll get to 20th eventually, heh. Oh,
and the primary spell that I used was Flame Shock.</I>

<I>The night was bright with stars and the moon was well on its way to set.
The moon cast a light blue glow that was barely noticeable amidst the soft
reddish glow of heat Aulura saw as she raced across the plains towards the
hill. She had been hunting for many hours with the troll, Chudd, and the
dark elven priestess, Zsalshun. Many gnoll reavers had fallen before their
might and even the undead reavers of the night were proving to not be much
of a challenge. Truly they needed some sort of challenge. <BR>
<BR>
Aulura sped along, weaving a mystical melody to make her faster than the
wolves that crossed the plains. Then she saw her prey, three undead gnolls
that waited atop a hill by a stone marker. &#147;Easssily dealt with for
usss.&#148; She said to herself as she ran forward and bellowed out a loud,
dissonant sound that caused one of the gnolls to growl in agony before running
after her, the other two in tow. Suddenly from around the hill two spirit
wolves came bounding, or rather flying, after her, a vicious look in their
undead eyes. She raced for Chudd and Zsalshun, knowing that without proper
working together the battle would easily overcome them. She took a turn and
continued to bellow, causing damage now to one of the spirit wolves that
followed her as she started circles around Chudd and Zsalshun. The two of
them were attacked by some and after suffering many blows defeated several
reavers, but Aulura now had four chasing her, plus a spirit wolf. Things
looked bleak but she feared little as she could sing forever, not fearing
that the enemies would ever overtake her unless she made her circle to tight.
She continued weaving her song of speed with bellows against the creatures
following her, weakening them and letting her keep her distance.<BR>
<BR>
Zsalshun called for a retreat, much to the relief of the ever-tiring Aulura
and she sped to the group, giving her gift of speed to both Zsalshun and
Chudd. Aulura took off, followed quickly by Zsalshun&#133; but where was
Chudd? Chudd had remained behind and was killing a single, lone reaver, which
he did, till the others got to him. Aulura turned around and raced back for
Chudd, Zsalshun near the wooden bridge, now beating out a rhythm on her drum
to speed her along even quicker. She raced down the bank and saw the troll
engaged to three reavers and a spirit wolf. With a quick jump she was there,
strumming a soft lullaby on her lute that caused all the creatures to fall
asleep. She then motioned Chudd to run and she sang her song for speed once
again, beating on the drum to speed the troll along as a single reaver followed
him, trying to hit him from behind. Soon though he outdistanced the reaver
and the two made it safely to the wooden bridge and crossed it to the north
Karanas, the gnolls still in rabid pursuit. <BR>
<BR>
The three sat down as they arrived to the other side, very thankful to be
alive. Aulura played a soft, healing melody to help them and celebrate that
they all made it out alive.<BR>
<BR>
~ Aulura<BR>
<BR>
OOC: Used Selo&#146;s Accelerondo for the speed, Busco&#146;s Boastful Bellow
to damage from a distance with Direct Damage. Weaved those two to keep creatures
occupied as I ran in a circle and bellow as I return from draws to soften
creatures up. Used the Lucid Lullaby to Mesmerize all the creatures around
Chudd so he could escape. Used healing Hymn to add some extra healing to
the group. </I>

<I>Overcoming the Scythe<BR>
<BR>
One of the greatest and most satisfying victories a person can do is the
first day you single handedly take on a scythe beetle. These vicious creatures
exist upon the northern Karana plains and prove difficult for even seasoned
warriors. Their bodies are huge and their mandibles able to piece the strongest
plate armor as if it was leather. They chop down men like a farmer chops
down an arrogant tree. Yet one day a person should finally overcome them.
At the twelfth string in the bard Aulura&#146;s life, she did what would
seem impossible to some, overcame a scythe beetle by
herself.<BR>
<BR>
---<BR>
The day in the Karanas had been a shining one and the sun shone bright and
clear. There were few clouds in the sky and rain seemed far off, which is
unusual for that time of year. Aulura looked about, this was back in the
days before her claws were dawned, and made sure to stay clear of wandering
griffawns. Then she spotted the site, a beetle so huge, walking down a hill
side and she knew just what to do. She raced for the creature and tried her
new song, a bellow so loud that it outdid a gong. She then took to flight
and brought it to a hill, and here it is the battle raged still. She ran
in circles, looped about with great ease, not once did the beetle come close
save when she did sneeze. She&#146;d keep up her bellow and her song for
her speed, and she kept right on moving not stopping to avoid the weeds.
Half a day did go by and then the deed it was done, the beetle lay there
dead, Aulura she had won. <BR>
<BR>
While some might say a bards tactics can be cowardly, they are able to overcome
odds that few others can. A bard can be dangerous and a bard can be strong,
why even this day she kills many a griffawn.</I>

<I>The rain soaked Aulura to the bone though Aulura always enjoyed the warm
rain of the Karanas upon her scaled arms and head. She always thought the
rain helped her to feel more alive, not that she needed to feel anymore alive
than she usually did. She raced around the plains, the clouds slowly starting
to break up and reveal sunlight to shine down to the ground below. Few creatures
save some large lions prowled the plains in the rain. Aulura was rather
displeased at not being able to find much successful blood in the fields
and casually killed one of the cats passing by her, whistling a small tune
as she worked.<BR>
<BR>
Aulura licked her claws clean with her serpentine tongue after claiming a
useable chunk of meat for a meal, though the pelt was too slashed to be of
any use. She told herself she should learn not to frenzy so much on weaker
creatures, but she always relished the fresh meat and warm blood that poured
forth so easily. <BR>
<BR>
A familiar and potentially dangerous scent was brought to her tongue as she
tasted the air looking for more prey. The smell of gnolls nearby, and gnolls
meant both blood and some money. It was a good day indeed and she scampered
off from her spot, leaving the rest of the lion to rot in the grasses and
be a meal for further scavengers. <BR>
<BR>
Aulura snuck up behind two gnolls, watching them carefully as they seemed
to be admiring something that one of them had found. It sparkled as they
passed it between their paws. She smiled, guessing they had probably looted
the gem from some poor, unprepared traveler or hunter. She then stepped out
from her place and bellowed loudly to get their attention, adding a wicked
sounding snarl that knocked one of the gnolls off his feet. The two chased
for Aulura as she ran forward to meet the two, her claws at the ready and
her other hand wielding a magical whip from some evil tentacle creature.
<BR>
<BR>
The two gnolls tried to bash Aulura with their bodies but she lithely stepped
out of the way and struck back as she wove a mystical melody. The tune made
both gnolls wince as their ears started to bleed from the dissonant sound
that they heard. Then she wove in a song that made her feel better as the
first of their blows landed upon her. Finally she started to whistle, making
her slash away with glee at the two gnolls, fear showing in their eyes at
the over zealous bardess.<BR>
<BR>
The blows from the gnolls fell upon Aulura, but she withstood them and struck
back, finally bringing one of the gnolls down into a bloody heap. She then
turned and snarled upon the other gnoll, weakened from her melodies, and
dove upon him.<BR>
<BR>
The battle was over within a few minutes, both gnolls lay dead on the ground,
appearing to have been mauled to death by some animal. Aulura was bleeding,
but the melody she wove about her helped her feel better shortly and she
smiled as she plucked an agate stone from the troll gnolls and several coins.
She licked clean her claws, relishing the taste of gnollish blood, and put
up her whip as she traveled on to seek what other prey might be about.</I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Balkin knelt in the tall grass below the hill, several pieces of his armor
lay around him. He kept a close watch, as he carefully bandaging his wounds.
The gnolls here gathered at the top of the hill continuously, making it easy
for him to draw out one or two at a time. They were decent fighters, but
no match for his enchanted blades. He had already killed several, claiming
what coin they carried, and even finding a small agate and, oddly enough,
a bronze 2 handed sword. "The stinking gnolls must have killed another traveler"
he thought grimly to himself.<BR>
<BR>
He looked into the sky and grinned evilly, "Aye, darkness falls, and the
Undead will be out soon", he chuckled to himself. He would rest for a few
moments, allowing his wounds to heal, before seeking out the first of what
he hoped would be many a undead gnolls to remove from the face of
Norrath.<BR>
<BR>
He watched the top of the hill carefully, as he continued to bandage his
wounds. The last gnoll, the one with the sword, had done considerable damage
unto Balkins body. Suddenly, he heard a melodius female voice yell for help!
He grabbed up his armor and weapons and donned them hurriedly. To his right,
ran a beautiful elven Paladin in armor similar to Balkins own, a fine burnished
bronze. She had two of the Undead Reavers in persuit and as she continued
to run in a weaving circle, a Spirit Stalker joined in the chase.<BR>
<BR>
He could nae let her die this way. Balkin took off, after them, eventually
chasing down one of the Undead Reavers and slammin one of his Langseax's
into its lower back. The Undead quickly turned and laid a brutal blow against
Balkin's helm, stunning him briefly, causing him to stagger backwards several
steps. When his vision cleared, Balkin was shocked to see both Undead Reavers
before him, trying to pierce his armor, and bash through his defenses. The
Spirit wolf had also stopped to throw itself against the armored dwarf. The
Elven Paladin however, was no where to be seen! He heard her shouting for
help as she ran towards the tremendous bridge leading to the Northern Plains
of Karana. As he attacked one of the undead before him, Balkor shouted into
the gathering darkness that he had removed them from her back, and she should
return to aid him!<BR>
<BR>
The blows from the Undead Reavers caused severe racking pain throughout the
Dwarves already damaged body. As he fended off another blow, he heard the
paladin run up behind him, heard her begin to chant, felt the wonderous healing
power she possessed flow over his flesh, closing some of his most recent
wounds. She then joined the fray, attacking the same Reaver that Balkin was
focusing his attacks on. Eventually the Undead Reaver dropped to the ground,
taking one last feeble swipe at the dwarf before what life it possesed fled
its body. Balkin turned slightly to more effectivly engage the other Undead.
He was growing dizzy and weak from the loss of blood he was sustaining, and
the brutal blows and bites being inflicted upon him by the undead, and the
Spirit wolf. The woman, seeing his plight, backed away, and once again, he
felt her healing powers flow over his much abused body. Shaking his head
to clear it, he saw her step forward, and once again join the fray agains
the Undead Reaver. It to, finally found its way to the grass, truely dead
now. The spirit stalker though, it knew the Dwarfs plight, the damage he
had received was nearly enough to kill him already, it would only take a
few more blows.<BR>
<BR>
Balkin turned again, nearly stumbling in his exhaustion, to face the wolf,
"No quarter" he thought to himself as he parried, and dodged several bites,
hacking his magical blades into the Spirit wolf. He knew he was near death,
and was ready to order the paladin away, since from the beginning, her magic
and body had been depleted of strength. Just as he began to yell for her
to run, she backed away again, and once again, Balkin felt the cool, wonderful
touch of her healing magic. The spirit wolf, sensing somehow that this was
its last chance, threw itself against the armored dwarf in a frenzy of brutal
assalts. A precise slam of both Langseax's into it's head and chest, ended
it's nubile existance in Norrath. <BR>
<BR>
Nearly passed out from blood loss, and shakey on his feet, Balkin took the
few coins the undead had in their rotting pouches and turned to the Tall
High Elven Paladin. She knelt before him. Thanking him for his sacrifice,
and honoring his name. He stumbled into her, as he started for the river...
"Come lass, tis no place to be holding a conversation, to the waters edge,
that I might bandage my wounds."<BR>
<BR>
She eagerly followed the dwarf to the waters edge, and watched in both
fascination and horror, as the dwarf, slowly and painfully, removed his armor,
displaying the brutal cris cros of ugly purplish red scars that covered him
from nearly head to toe... She sat, thanking him over and over. Finally,
Balkin growled at her... "yer welcome lass, now let it go... tis my path
in life ta be in the thick of battle, ta be taking wounds, and tis my personal
choice ta nae let anyone die if I can help them. <BR>
<BR>
She blushed, then pulled forth from her pack a prayer book. She focused on
the matra's and words contained within it and began her meditaions, trying
to regain her depleted magical powers. She found it difficult to concentrate
however, and constantly watched over the top of her prayer book, as the grizzled
dwarf calmly and with a blank face, began stiching his own wounds closed,
and firmly bandaging them when the sewing was complete. The deep intense
pain in his eyes, belied his calm demeanor, and she knew he had suffered
greatly in his rescuing of her life. <BR>
<BR>
She focused on her prayer book with determination, she could not let him
leave her side in the condition he was in. Before she was done with her
meditations, she felt his hand upon her shoulder. She looked up, straight
into that grizzled, scarred face, and deeply into his eyes. "Remove yer armor
lass, I've extra bandages for the binding of yer wounds." She blushed again,
but did as he said with no protest, then sat and tried to meditate as he
cleaned and bandaged her wounds to the best of his ability. "Ye nae can let
these stay open lass", he explained, as he sewed closed a gash in her thigh.
"and nae let them go without a cleaning. The Undead are dirty, and ye may
be further infected from their rotting flesh." She shuddered at the thought.
Quietly, she looked at him as he worked. The scars were everywhere, angry
red and purple, even on his back and head... She could see the tracery through
his auburn hair. She looked down, and watched him hold his hand against her
leg. The redish scars there, displayed agains the faint healed scars from
her previous battles. She wondered then, why his scars had not
faded.<BR>
<BR>
Balkin looked at his strong wide hand, as it lay agains her leg. She also
had many scars, though nae even close to as many as he, but hers were all
faided into a pale white, accept for her most recent wounds. He again, felt
shame at his scars. Slowly, Balkin looked up at the beautiful elven woman,
his thoughts distant, it was not so long ago that he had bandaged Lady Amorsaylnn
dark skin in the same manor, after a battle against the undead. She to had
scars, though faint and faded against her dark skin. When he came back to
the present, he saw the paladins prayer book on the ground by her side. She
was looking at him... Balkin quickly stood and strode off to don his armor,
blushing, he could not make himself look at her face again.<BR>
<BR>
"There ye go lass, tis the best I can do. Ye'll need yer healing magics to
fix the rest of the damage ye have received."<BR>
<BR>
"Yes", she responded quietly.<BR>
<BR>
Balkin heard her stand, as he donned the last of his armor, and buckled his
sword belt around his waist. Her faint chanting came to his ears, just as
he felt, once again, her soothing healing magic race through his damaged
body. Over and over she chanted her prayers to her god, a constant blue light
washing over the awed dwarf, his wounds healing, his strength returning,
full vitality returning to his body.<BR>
<BR>
He stood watching, as she finished her chanting, fully restored by her magic.
Quickly, he looked again, at himself. More scars than ever. Sighing deeply,
he looked up just as she again, knelt before him. "It would please me if
you should call upon me, be you ever in need My Lord Balkin. You have saved
my life this night, and know that I am grateful". He glanced down again,
at her graceful body, then looked into her eyes. "Aye lass, I shall do so,
be I ever in need of aid again." She nodded as she stood. Balkin bowed before
her. " I thank ye for yer healing magic my lady, you will be well here?"
<BR>
<BR>
"Yes friend, I will meditate awhile longer, then heal myself of the last
of these wounds."<BR>
<BR>
"Then I must be off lass. Good journey to you..."<BR>
<BR>
He turned on his heel, and strode into the night, heading towards High hold.
He needed a drink and a bed for the night. The coins he had gathered from
the Reavers would cover his expenses adequately, and he knew a merchant who
would purchase both the gem, and the 2 handed sword from him for additional
coin. Quickly, he strode off, not looking back.<BR>
<BR>
She watched him with her sad elven eyes, as he strode purposfully away from
her... into the darkness. Never had she seen one like him. There was something
besides those scars that made him stand out. She would
remember.<BR>
<BR>
((/OOC I was soloing reavers and down under 2 bubbles health. Bandaged up
to 2 bubbles when I heard the cry for help. Elven paladin (16th, I was 20th)
running in an eratic patern that somewhat resembled a circle. Two Undead
reavers, and just before I caught her, a Spirit Stalker. I taunted and slashed
one, it turned and stunned me bad! Started me spinning in a cirlce. when
I finally turned around... all three were on me! ARGH!!! She shouted about
reavers to the bridge, so I shouted back that I had them, and for her to
come back and help me. She came back, but was at 2 bubbles herself and almost
OOM. she got one heal in, then not enough mana for another. This continued,
her fighting until enough mana, then casting a heal on me. By the time the
fight was over, I had exactly 17 HP left. 17 out of 569 or so. My health
was so low, that she couldn't taunt anything off me, and they all attacked
me through the whole fight. Frenzied on me I guess. I looted, then we ran
for the water! I bandaged while she meditated, then bandaged her as well,
then she healed me to full, and herself some. The story is of course, just
that, but is fairly accurate... she "Kneels before you in blah blah blah
and reverance" before me so many times I was getting embarrased! Anyway,
not much magic involved, till the end that is, but that's the best a dwarven
warrior can come up with here! =) Good hunting everyone!)) </I>

With the gesture, some distance away an orcish medic erupted into flame,
all the while being hacked away by the powerful blades of Keldore's
comrades-in-arms.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Orcish warriors, soldiers, fanatics, shamans, and medics came at the group
of six in wave after wave. Numerous times were the brave souls forced to
retreat to the superficial safety of the Kithicor Woods. However, it was
the most invigorating hunting that the wizard of House Winterborne had done
in quite some time.<BR>
As with every advancement in the world of Norrath, Keldore could feel in
his draconic soul that he had indeed mastered the 19th Level within the Wizard's
guild and was ready to gain access to two new areas of Norrathian magic,
Force and True Teleportation.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Trouble-makers then dampened the spirit of the group, driving Keldore,
and his two new friends, Mykky and Eggman, from Highpass for a less frustrating
hunt. It had been such a great day until then.<BR>

(I was basically confined to Flame Shock and Shock of Lightning all day,
but it was still a great time. There was definately no shortage of monsters,
and at only very rare intervals was my group challenged for the spot against
the orcs. Then, of course, people came and began abusing our adherence to
the Play Nice policy, whining first that we were stealing their kills, and
then in retalliation did the same, claiming that Highpass is now, always
was, and ever shall be, Free for All. Whatever, we stuck around for about
15 more minutes and then let the babies have the stupid spot and went to
hunt the inkie guards, heh. I DID make it to 20th, but then I died just before
we left Highpass. One more kill should get me back...perhaps for a bit of
twisted fate I'll go kill a beetle in NK!) </I>

<I>The rumors the beast had pervaded Olam's mind even when he was a mere
teen. The thoughts that creation ever spewed forthsuch a beast haunted him.
The idea that this was the same creature he was about to face . . . the Avatar
of Fear . . . sent a chill down his spine. Surely the name itself was an
advantage to the creature.<BR>
<BR>
So it was, with skin shining and glowing, that Olam approach the beast.
Carefully, he worked his calming magiks on the lizards that had gathered
to worship the abomination. The firey shielding provided him by a magician
in his group acted to embolden his courage. Then, of course, the cleric's
magik gave him a whole new sense of courage and valor . . . probably what
led to his fool hearty decision in the end.<BR>
<BR>
With the surrounding lizards in a trance, Olam approached the beast -- a
lumbering hulk, that had a barely distinguishable head atop a massively muscular
body. The hairs and muck on the beast had distracted the ranger long enough
for his group members to ask what the hold up was . . . he shook his head
and took a deep breath. <BR>
<BR>
With a wave of his hand, Olam brought forth the worst of the insect swarms
he could manage. The beast hurled around and called forth the surrounding
lizards to his aid as he charged Olam. Olam turned and ran up the narrow
ramp to the waiting crowd. As he opened the door a wave of pain racked his
body. The Avatar smiled as he sapped Olam's life and continued up the ramp
after him. Quickly the group's cleric repaired what he could of the
attack.<BR>
<BR>
As the ranger turned around the oaken door flung open to reveal the hideous
beast. Thankfully, it was only the beast and the calming magiks had prevented
any help. The warriors in the group swung great blue axes upon the beasts
arms and chest. Olam's Ebony blade shone with the blood of the beast and
the Obsidian dagger pierced the great beast several times over. Then Olam
saw the shine of the claws he once held . . . the Thulian bladed claws ripped
through the warrior standing next to him. His crafted breastplate folded
under the onslaught and he staggered, despite the cleric's healing powers.
The beast continued his attacks, flailing arms rapidly cutting and clawing
through their targets. The beast let forth stomach wrenching cries of torment
with each hit, that to this day, the ranger can nae describe similarity to.
Just then, a lizard justicar had appeared to his Avatar's aid. The beast
was healed of all damage. The group continued the attack while the enchanter
attempted to stop the aid . . . success!<BR>
<BR>
The time had to come to step up his efforts. The ranger was fully healed,
and fully protected. All the years of training led to this; the ranger taunted
the beast with obscenities. The beast knocked the second warrior back and
almost had him slain when Olam finally said the right words describing the
god of the Avatar. The beast whirled around and beared down on the ranger's
body. Blow after blow rained down on him. The ranger&#146;s bones cracked,
his ivy ring curled and shattered at the attacks. The cleric healed him once,
twice . . . the warriors continued their assault on the beast from behind
as Olam was knocked back and forth between the beasts arms. First the left
then then the right, the mighty Thullian blades cut through him quickly .
. . and then it was quiet.<BR>
<BR>
Olam saw the years of training, the friends, the fights, the enemies and
allies . . . they all whirled past him. Then there was a dull light. Olam
heard the battle cries of Ogres and the yapping of hurt dogs. "Ogguk" he
weakly sighed. His broken body lie under the weight of a slain Avatar. His
group was nerely decimated. His sacrifice allowed a quick retreat to North
Karana. The group, in disgust, disbanded, leaving Olam to his task . . .
a rejoining of body and mind. <BR>
<BR>
Upon taking secretive measures, Olam returned and found his broken body.
A master rogue handed Olam the claws from the beast. Fitting, it had his
blood on them. "These I believe should go to you, ranger" Olam accepted the
offering with a weak thanks and casted what beneficial magiks he could upon
the kind soul. "I know a ranger who could use these very blades," Olam said,
as he made a mental note to Trespare.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
OOC: Dismally ready for such a beast, I had symbols, shields and buffs for
the Avatar. The group was a low 30s group with two high 50s watching the
display. Probably should have had mid 30s group for the AOF grouping in CT.
I was at 1100 hp when I began taunting and within 30s was decimated by the
60 to 90 point attacks. I hear it's rough when he has the claws as it's a
quick attack, but actually does more damage than then claws should do ; )
The two 50s would have saved us, but I didn't yell for help like an idiot.
And actually, I guess we could have won, but when the liz healer helaed the
AOF up to pre fight status, with us all at 2bubs of health...it was pretty
much over. </I>
