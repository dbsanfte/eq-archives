<I>Mica woke up disoriented, cold, hungry and vaguely uneasy. He remembered
running into Qeynos after thinking he had mastered the tiger strike SiFu
LuSun had shown him several orders ago. He had jogged up the ramp to the
guild house. Always on the move and always impatient, the young monk burst
through the door and found SiHing Phin. The elder deemed Young Mica worthy
to continue on and had given the monk a blocking drill to practice and use.
Mica spent time going through the drill and memorizing each move until he
could do it in his sleep. He wanted badly to run back to the planes and put
this technique to actual application in hopes of mastering it and moving
onto the next. Mica had always been first and best in his training. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Unfortunately there were errands he had to run in town and it made no
sense to run back to the planes loaded down and heavy with coin and odd weapons
he had picked up. He gritted his teeth at the delays and finally realized
that it was too late to run back. He grudgingly walked back to his room at
the Lion's Mane Inn and lay down on the bed. He would rest for just a moment
to gather energy for the run back. Somehow he had fallen asleep. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Now he woke up somewhere strange in a land covered in snow and ice. The
wind howled through his thin silk clothes and his feet crunched through the
thin ice cap of the tundra snow. He shivered as the heat was ripped away
from his body to be dispersed uncaringly on the long flat horizon. Mica picked
a direction and started walking. Anywhere else was better than standing in
the middle of nowhere. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>After a time the featureless tundra became a blur in his mind. He was
shaking so violently that his steps were starting to become erratic and his
mind slipped over visions and conversations of his past in no particular
order. He could no longer feel his feet as his frozen sandles picked themselves
up endlessly one after another and moved him onward. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Something tugged at his mind and he became aware of the fact that he had
stopped . Before him the snow began to ripple and the monk stared at it in
fascinated stupification. The unease he had first felt grew and a part of
his mind analyzed it. The rippling snow exploded in a draconian image and
the unease intensified. He recognized it as dragon fear as his conditioning
kicked in. The Ancient had taught him to control the human desire to cower
from these magnificent beasts. The Ancient had also taught Mica to revere
them above all else and the frozen knight reflexively bent to one knee to
offer homage to the creature. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>**This is what you have offer me?** </I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The voice that filled his mind echoed with scorn and disgust. He felt
the repulsion of the creature who invaded his thoughts. It was looking for
something and Mica cringed as the presence rifled through his experiences
as if they were a stack of child's drawings and discarded them as inconsequential
and useless. Mica was ashamed. He was nothing compared to this mighty creature.
</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>**You disgust me, child of Azure. Your pathetic clinging and groveling
at my feet sickens me. Mighty knight.** A derisive snort of laughter roared
through his thoughts. **Your whole order is a waste of time. What do you
possibly think you can do for the likes of me?** An expectant pause filled
Mica's head. The creature was still in his mind but waiting. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Mica was confused. He had tried to follow the creature's thoughts as they
plowed through his memories but all he wound up doing was trailing behind
the beast as it tore through his head. Now there was a calm in the draconic
storm and Mica pulled back into his own mind. The young monk sought the peace
and quiet of his inner core in hopes of regaining his balance. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>**There is nowhere you can hide.** The presence followed his thoughts,
moving through Mica's weak mental shields as if they were shadows thrown
across a pathway. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"This is not the way it works-" He threw the thought at the beast. Laughter
bellowed in his mind as the dragon lowered it's head to Mica's level. The
huge eyes glinted iridescently at the monk and arctic cold breath puffed
his silk tunic flat against his chest. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>**And who says so?** </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The Ancient had taught Mica all there was to know about the order of Azure.
Dragons were supposed to be noble and the sons of Azure were to be their
protectors in their time of trouble. So it was envisioned, so it was meant
to be. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Again scornful laughter interrupted his thoughts. **You misguided idiot.
Do you really think my children can not handle something as trivial as a
small setback in power? Do you even have any idea how long my children have
been overcoming adversity? ** </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The visions though, the Ancient had taught him about- </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>**Azure was a fool prone to flights of fancy. Sadly you are a product
of his delusions, that is all.** </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>That wasn't right. Azure was wise and chose to train the Sons for the
day when his brethen would need their help. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>**Your purpose has no foundation. A dragon needs no help from the likes
of you to overcome such a trivial matter of a home destroyed and some magics
lost.** </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>But they had trained for generations against- </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>**Against nothing. You never had a time, you never will.** </I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Mica blinked. He had been told as far back as he could remember about
Azure and the visions. He couldn't shake the conviction that there was truth
in the words. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>**So like the infant races to cling to their uninformed ideals.** The
beast narrowed it's eyes and lifted it's frost adorned head up off of the
tundra. The snow under the massive jaws had been crushed flat in a wagon
sized divot but not melted. The chill of the beast wrapped it's icy fingers
around Mica's heart even as the last puff of breath whipped his wild hair
about his head. He felt compelled to follow the beast's gaze as it drew back
to it's full height and towered over the small human. Years of conditioning
ignored the beasts words and comforted the knight against the thoughts the
dragon provoked in his mind. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The beast did not know what it spoke of. It could not know because it
was not a son of Azure. Mica stopped as the automatic response filled his
head. It had become like blocking a blow with his shield, so often he had
been told how he and the others were different. Now he no longer thought
about the incoming attack he just moved his shield into place and the blow
glanced off of it. It never occurred to him to look beyond and question what
was thrown at him. Now he did. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The small human stood ankle deep in the biting snow with his head craned
uncomfortably back while his eyes remained locked in the misty swirl of the
giant beast's gaze. The empty tundra tugged at his body, pulling at the cured
silk cape draped around his shoulders. The fabric offered him no protection
as it snapped and danced to the soulless whine of the northern winds. They
whispered to him a haunting tune that mocked his teachings and belittled
the foundation of his being. He questioned his purpose. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>His order, trained for generations in the spine of the mountains, believed
in&#133;a cause. It was said the noble Sapphire turned his back on his kin
to one day save them. The brotherhood was his legacy, they were the tool
of the winged one's salvation. Or so he had been taught. So had generations
before been taught. So had generations before trained, taught and died believing.
If the beast was right and the dragons did not need the brotherhood then
what was there to fight for? What was his purpose? Mica heard the whisper
of the Ancient in the bitter wind: Stand tall and remember the teachings.
</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"This is a test. You seek to undermine my faith and shake me from my cause-"
</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>**SILENCE!** </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Mica dropped to his knees and cradled his head as the shout exploded through
his mind. The world went silent as he stared unseeing into the dazzling snow.
Vaguely he was aware of moisture rolling down his face drop by drop as splashes
of crimson added color to the tundra snow. He put a hand to his face. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>**Faith is a tool for warping the weak of mind.** </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Mica pulled his hand away. The palm was slick with blood. He could feel
the warm trickle running down his neck as he sat back on his heels. He noticed
that his thoughts were still now and wondered at the calm in his mind. He
wondered if it had anything to do with the growing stain on the snow. He
wondered if he were dying. He wondered if anyone would really notice the
absence of one young knight. He wondered why the knight was a knight at all.
He wondered what he believed in. He wondered if it was anything different
than what he had been told he believed in. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He closed his eyes. Why did he exist at all? Why would something as powerful
and noble as a dragon need a human such as himself? It was like training
a mouse to be the salvation of his own race. He saw that now; the flaw in
the brotherhood. They had gone on for generation after generation; so sure
that the next one was the cumulation of all their efforts, going on another
cycle when it wasn't. An entire community of trained mice waiting for their
chance at a delusioned glory. He had never stopped to question why, but the
question had always been there buried under years of training and lessons.
It was a question who's answer left him as empty as the frozen waste he knelt
on. Without the cause he had no meaning. He opened his eyes to the vast unending
horizon and felt the emptiness wrap itself around his heart. It offered mocking
comfort for his fallen messiah. </I>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Mica breathed in a long silent breath and then puffed it out into the
frozen air. He was a fighter. Stripped of his brotherhood, equipment and
ideals he was still a fighter. It was the one constant that he could count
on. It was the one thing he was good at, it was the one thing he would do.
That would have to be his meaning and purpose now that the beast in front
of him had yanked the truth from his mind and laid it bare for him to discover.
He hated the creature for its cruelty. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Instantly he felt ashamed as his programmed reverence for the creatures
of scale balked at his thoughts. He savagely pushed aside his shame and let
the anger take seed. He glared up into the eyes of the beast. He would know
this creature's name so that when the day came where he had grown strong
enough, he could shout the creature's legacy mockingly to the winds as he
stood atop it's severed head. The tundra winds would take his words and spread
them over the planes to die in echoing whispers alongside the vestiges of
his faith. It gave him a purpose and something to look forward to. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The creature looked back down at him and the young knight felt a shift
in it's thoughts. It was like a mental nod as if something it had been waiting
for had come to pass. Before he could even start to puzzle the shift out
a myriad of images jumbled through his thoughts. He saw a smoke red horizon.
The crumbling ruins of a city wall. The burnt out remains of a building.
A battlefield strewn with mangled corpses. A low angry sun glaring across
a beach of bones. The twisted corpse of a violet eyed drow. The lifeless
face of his arctic consort. Faces of those he knew lying sightless as the
sun sank into the earth. In the last dusky glow he noticed the first movement
he had seen in all these visions. A solitary earth pet moved slowly back
and forth over the body of it's master. Her clear brown eyes looked into
his own for a moment before the spark of her being wavered and died. The
pet rippled once and soundlessly disappeared. The moon never rose. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Mica reeled from the onslaught. He didn't understand. He tried to sort
out the visions and isolate them into some sort of order but there were too
many too fast. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>**That was Azure's dream. What did you see?** </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Mica frowned. He remembered vividly some of the vignettes while others
were a blur. He shook his head. Death, destruction but most of all it was
the overwhelming sense of futileness that griped the man's mind. He was disturbed
by the lack of sense in all of it. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>**This is the reason for your existence.** </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>A frown creased the young man's mind. These visions had lead to the creation
of the brotherhood and the beguiling of generations of his people but no
where did he see any clue as to how the brotherhood could even begin to prevent
such a catastrophe. He wondered how Azure had come to the conclusion he had.
</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>**My children have their flaws too. Azure recognized some of the bodies
as his own brethren and concluded that it was a premonition to the downfall
of his kind. Typical of my children he assumed the vision was meant for him
and him alone. He decided to create a legion of fighters that were trained
well enough to protect his race from this fate. He missed the point.** </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Mica quirked his head to one side. If the point wasn't what Azure had
thought then what was the point? He went through the visions he could remember
detail by gruesome detail until he saw something he had missed. In the vision
of the ruined wall was a corner of a shield. It was green and yellow with
a city emblazoned on it. The standard of Qeynos. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>**You are beginning to understand. These are the last moments of this
land. Few believe what will come to pass. Fewer understand how it will happen.
I alone believe it can be stopped. I call you to stand against the force
that will see this world ruined.** </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Mica furrowed his eyebrows. Wasn't this creature asking for him to place
faith in what it said? He hesitated. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>**Not faith. Conviction. Look around and tell me you can not already see
the signs.** </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Mica thought about the new land he had come to. There was a strange tension
that one noticed at first but then quickly got used to. Races walked cat's
feet about each other as they went on their business. Factions formed, fought
and dispersed as the people of Norrath went through their lives, oblivious
to the growing unease that crept across the land. The monk nodded. He understood
in his heart that something was wrong. Not because this creature had told
him, but because the sense of wrongness grated against his soul. He could
feel it's black claws picking delicately at the fabric of the land as it
unraveled it slowly bit by bit. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>**Join me.** </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Mica hesitated again. He was leery of placing his devotion in another
cause so quickly after his first one had been stripped from him. He felt
the presence in his mind do another one of those strange mental nods. The
human felt that his hesitation was expected and even approved of. He wondered
who this creature was. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>**You have the answer to both questions. You will know what to do when
the time comes.** </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The dragon turned translucent and faded slowly away. Mica shivered as
he was once again left alone on the open waste. </I>
<P ALIGN=Center>

<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He sat bolt upright in bed, his heart pounding. The window showed the
faint light of the setting moon and Mica realized he had slept longer than
he had planned. He shook his head, the soft crackle of the merchant's distant
fires a sharp report in his ears as the sounds of the night rushed into his
room. After the silence of his dream the hushed murmur of the night's voice
fairly screamed at him. He took a deep breath and swung his legs off of the
bed. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"She comes to you in dreams!" it was whispered. The lady Vox, calling
her chosen by the tendrils of dreaming had paid a visit in the ghosts of
his sleeping. Mica sat a moment longer as a wry smile tugged at his mouth.
He had the answer to his other question as well. He looked at the round moon
as it dipped below the city walls. He would fight to keep that orb in the
sky and this land from being torn asunder. He stood up and stretched, filling
the basin with water to wash the last of the sleep from his eyes. He would
need to practice what LuSun had taught him if he were to be any use to the
lady. The monk splashed water onto his face and stopped as the bowl filled
with a watery crimson. His skewing reflection stared back at him as the rivulets
of dried blood mixed with the water. The arctic winds whispered in his mind.
