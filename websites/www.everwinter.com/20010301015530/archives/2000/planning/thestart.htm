<I>"Damn it! Why must I always have to wait in lines.." Tapping her foot
impatiently the black-skinned elf nearly shivered with pent up energy. Muttering
under her breath she finally shoved her way forwards and grabbed the attention
of the barkeep. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>"Brandy, and lots of it&#133;20 bottles, stoppered and wax sealed for
travel..And be quick about it!" Throwing down a handful gold coins on the
counter, ignoring the boggling eyes of the other patrons, she grabbed her
now full knapsack and trotted out into the dark city. Of course, the city
was always dark, seeing as how it was built into the mountain. The only lights
that brightened it were the glowing neon webs of magic that hung silent in
the air at numerous locations to guild the way of the newly arrived. Perfect
accompaniments to the darkness, small shadows, silent and deadly moved quickly
among the streets. Pressing herself to the gates of the vast city, Eclipsed
looked out into the lush forest. Time to earn my money I suppose. Having
taken a small commission to help rid the city gates and closer forest of
spiderlings and other undesirables, she strapped her pack on and headed out
in the direction the guards pointed. </I>

<I> Not long, it was only a short run to the location. Apparently several
others had gotten there first. Corpses littered the ground; the multitude
of legs and gore that spread across the path was still fresh. Slowing to
a walk, she glanced around, just in time to see one of the queen spiders,
a giant of a specimen, attempt to wrap her up in its web and take her home
for a meal. Plunging her snake-fang dagger into its eyes in a repeated effort
to blind it she hopped about, agile as ever, to avoid being bitten. The small,
quick pain in her arm as the giant spider managed to score a bite didn't
even phase her continued attack. After several minutes, the fight was over,
the spider lay dead and she peeled the webs off its underside to sell in
town. Feeling a bit light-headed, she teetered over to a fallen log and sat
down heavily. It was then that she folded back the sleeve on her tunic and
noticed the swollen, red bite mark. Poison was already coursing in her blood
now, and nothing could be done except to sit and hope it ran its course before
she passed out from thirst or fever. Thankfully she had a full 20 bottles
of Brandy to keep her company. Grinning with wickedness, she pulled her pack
off and began to remove the wax from the first bottle, still chill from the
tavern's lockbox. </I>
