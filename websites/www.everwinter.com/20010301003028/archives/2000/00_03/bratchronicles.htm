<I>The salty breeze that wafted over the city walls was refreshing. Too many
pent up animals and bodies made for a rank smelling afternoon in the marketplace.
Qeynos was unnaturally busy. The crowded streets teemed with folks anxious
to sell or trade their wares to the highest bidder. &#147;Great,&#148; the
pale lady noted sourly from her perch atop a broken-down cart, &#147;a bazaar.
Of all the days, it had to be the day I decide to come back to town. I
should&#146;ve stayed on the plains&#133;&#148; Just then, Shar spied a high
elf gawking at her. &#147;What are ye looking at, ye sniveling trollop? Why
don&#146;t ye get some clothes on before I tan that scrawny hide of
yours?&#148;<BR>
<BR>
The scantily clad elf didn&#146;t realize she&#146;d been gaping at the
barbarian. When she realized Shar&#146;s barb was directed toward her, she
gasped, covering her mouth with one jeweled hand, each finger bedecked in
gaudy rings. She tugged on her beau&#146;s sleeve and they managed to lose
themselves in the crowd.<BR>
<BR>
Shar watched them move along until something else caught her eye. A young
boy was earning his keep as well as any of the merchants in the market square.
Shar&#146;s eyes glinted with amusement as the boy deftly lifted a few coins
from a fat old man leaning over a display table. And then again, he lightened
the load of another tourist, and then another. He was good, but Shar could
tell he was getting reckless. Finally, he paused at a food cart and helped
himself to a plump loaf of sweetbread. He paid for it, grinning
proudly.<BR>
<BR>
**Taking a break, are ye lad? That was an impressive day&#146;s work.** The
pale lady stared evenly at the boy, who looked around frantically. When he
finally saw her, she chuckled. **Oh, don&#146;t worry about me. I enjoyed
the show. You have an eye for your prey. I appreciate that** The pale lady
began to cast a spell, and then another. **Hopefully, these will see ye through
the rest of your afternoon. Don&#146;t get too greedy, lad. There&#146;s
always the morrow.**<BR>
<BR>
The boy nodded apprehensively then scurried off down an alley. Shar stood
and made her way to North Qeynos. She had some shopping of her own to do.

<I>Cyrinx left the tavern a bit dazed and very much intrigued after speaking
with the barbarian. The barbarian witch, Sharhel Despana, boldly contended
that the highest form of native intelligent life on Norrath were animations,
creations of an Erudite outcast, Winter. The crux of her argument infuriated
him at first and then made him laugh. But the possibility of uncovering
Winter&#146;s research and confirming his success was enticing. He&#146;d
heard of Winter&#146;s legend, but never thought there was any truth to the
myths.<BR>
<BR>
Now, this self-proclaimed &#145;animation&#146; as she called herself, was
looking for backing to fund the research for her outlandish thesis. If she
came up with the evidence to support her thesis, there was no doubt she&#146;d
be granted honorary status among the alumni of the University of Erudin.
Either that or she&#146;d be wanted for treason of the highest order in that
land.<BR>
<BR>
Either outcome, however, was unlikely. Cyrinx was convinced that her research
would be for naught. It was a hair-brained argument to say the least. But
her research could potentially lead to uncovering the mysteries of Winter&#146;s
work. And that was what Cyrinx was interested in.</I>
