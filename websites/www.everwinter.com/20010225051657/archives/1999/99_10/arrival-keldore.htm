<I>Though slight, the alteration magic used in ag'Keldore's spell interfered
with that in use during the evacuation of Cynnabaris. Briefly, Keldore, Bowen,
and Drakor touched the ground before the Dark Spire. The mixing of the two
similar magics flung the three to a random point. The power of the Spire's
magic was sufficient, however, to ensure their arrival on the world of
Solon.<BR>
<BR>
Linked by luck, the three dazed individuals ended up together in the heart
of the powerful human nation, Pembroke City. Tall hedges and the aroma of
flowers surrounded them. They sat for a long while, not moving or speaking,
gathering their wits and trying to discern where exactly they
were.<BR>
<BR>
Bowen was the first to speak, "Have we made it to Solon?" He stood, brushed
off his pearl colored robes, and gazed upon the magnificant gardens that
lay around him.<BR>
<BR>
Keldore was the next to rise to his feet, likewise brushing off his robes.
"I'm not sure. See anyone around?" He, too, began noticing the flora around
them.<BR>
<BR>
Drakor stood, still wary of the two with him, and there was an immediate
shout from across the gardens.<BR>
<BR>
"Halt in the name of the law!" Three armed and armored figures were approaching.
The three were too stunned to prepare a defense, nessecary or not. They just
stood, awaiting the imminent questioning of the guards.</I>

<I>The guards did not bother asking questions just then. They demanded immediate
surrender instead. Keldore and Bowen complied, Keldore raising his hands,
Bowen setting his sword upon the ground. Drakor was hesitant, however. It
was clear that he was prepared to fight his way through this mess and land
the three of them into a larger one.<BR>
<BR>
"There is no use fighting...cooperate and we will be freed," Bowen whispered
to the dark elf, not taking his eyes off the guards. They seemed noble enough,
but one could never tell by simple appearances. City guards were not known
for being gentle with prisoners who didn't do what they said. Finally, with
just a bit more goading from Bowen, Drakor complied. <BR>
<BR>
One of the three guards stepped forward with manticles, approaching Drakor.
The dark elf seemed likely to strike out at the guard, so Keldore intercepted
the guard, placing himself between him and Drakor. "There is no need to bound
us, good sir. We will cooperate with the law. I am sure you will find us
to be without transgression." The guard muttered something to the others
and they nodded, grunting somewhat. <BR>
<BR>
"Come with us. No funny business either," the guard with the irons barked
as he backed away from the high elf. The guards led them into a small gatehouse
at the entrance to the gardens. Two of the guards flanked them, while one
brought up the rear. Keldore was still wondering what he was going to tell
the guards once they started to ask questions.</I>
