<I>Walking away from the pyramid in the West Commons I turned around and
waved my farewell to Aspect and his lovely wife for the evening. The hunt
had been successful and Aspect had gotten the components he need. &#147;Funny
how the are quick to accept me as a friend rather then an enemy.&#148; I
said as a grinned and walked into befallen where I was to meet an old friend
upon who had recived word of my d\aughter. Soon after I arrived Nazaluck
the Troll wafted in and gave me a bloodsatined letter. He scratched himself
and said he had pried the letter from a body of a guard of the Indigo
Brotherhood. It read&#133;<BR>
<BR>
Lady Seloxia Punox,<BR>
Word of the renegade&#146;s daughter are true. The Di&#146;Githyen bloodline
is note quieted as you once wished. Rackin seems to have had a child born
to him, from whom I do not know. The daughter carries with her the family
sword as once Rackin did in his early age. She currently inhabits the sewers
and underground passages of Freeport. At this time there is nothing to report
on Rackin other then he seems to have regained his sanity thanks to a magician
of some sort or spies have a troubled time keeping up with him. There is
word also of another that may interest you, Dravin friend to the Di&#146;Githyen
house hold has also been sighted around the Freeport area.<BR>
<BR>
Guard X&#146;Onnu<BR>
<BR>
Well it seems my foster mother is keeping an eye out for my blood and me.
Smiling I left Nazaluck with a few platinum and to be on my way. Seeking
a place where I could reflect over the past months actions and counter actions
that had taken place I thought for a moment about my daughter, it seems she
is tracing my footsteps in place to place taking the same path I did when
I was young, maybe there could be hope for her hatred or at least her soul.
Ariving at a thatched hut that seemed to be empty I strolled in bared the
door and rested from my travels. <BR>
<BR>
I sat thinking about Flutrose, Saidaar, Peony, Kerilar, Aspect and his wife,
my daughter, and my very own self. So many take me for granted not realizing
that at any moment they could be laying dead at my feet with their blood
stained on my armor and sword. The only one who really knows anything about
me is Flutrose. She has seen my hatred for myself and everything around me,
the hatred that led me to loose my mind and body to the sprit of my father.
Peony was always glad to see him or here from him. That short furfooted cleric
that had originally showed him what friendship was all those years ago in
the Desert of Ro. Kerilar his wood elf companion, by blood an teaching they
should have killed each other at the first sight of one another, but no,
they still stood in perfect health and together in battle they have fought
many times. Aspect and his wife, Pella, another mystery to why the accepted
him. Rackin the Tier&#146;Dal trained to hate and kill. A walking death pawn.
Some toy in the games that the gods play with. Why do so many people accept
me as one of there own. Why do they &#145;care&#146; so much for one warrior
who is nothing more then that.<BR>
<BR>
Being confused and angered at myself I broke the door done and marched out
into the night in hopes the answers would come to me. But to not dally in
thought I paced my trip that night to home. Neriak.</I>
