	<I> </I><B><I>History: </I></B><I>Like the other clans of Winterborne, Justice
	hails back to the Dragon Isles, specifically a family of benevolent gold
	dragons making their home in the City of Law, on the great Exaurdon Isle.
	For many centuries, Justice was led by Magic Lawgiver. When she stepped down,
	Johan Graye, the platinum paladin, took control of Clan Justice. The Grayes
	disappeared in the wake of the Orb Winter and are believed to be lost, but
	House Winterborne continues their tradition by naming this clan in their
	memory. The Clan has also been strongly influenced by Clan Pinnacle and Talisman
	Silvermane. Though Talisman does not travel Norrath, his student Keldore
	Silverwand does, and has been a cornerstone of what the revived Clan Justice
	stands for.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Center>
	<I><IMG BORDER="0" ALIGN="Middle" SRC="bar.gif" WIDTH="510" HEIGHT="19"></I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I><B>Dogma:</B> I am glad to see you are drawn to our Clan. We of Clan Justice
	welcome all good beings. Good? A vague word for many of the less educated,
	but a respect for life is our cardinal goal. It's that simple. Any lasting
	and just society must be founded upon this principle. To join our Clan is
	to fight darkness with light. We are the legend behind the knighthoods of
	many lands. Chivalry stems from our code. Many possess the literacy to read
	of our codex, but few possess the fortitude to practice it. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>We stand alone when we must, but we do not seek to become a martyr. Such
	aspirations are the sign of unfounded pride and a desire for fame, not what
	is right.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>Unless a burst of pure brightness is the only choice that will route the
	enveloping night, we stay with our Clan and charges. Our lives are more important
	than that of our base foes, but no life is more important than that of our
	charges. Without our word, accomplishments are simply self-serving. Rally
	in the righteousness. Those of the light can join together, yet we do not
	lose our individual hue. The more woe we best, the more weal will welcome
	the innocent. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>Pride is not for us. Our clan metal&#151;silver&#151;is the metal of purity,
	a mirror ready to reflect any flaw back at those who gaze upon it. Those
	who are of the light will strive to overcome these shortcomings. Those who
	cannot resist the darkness will strike out against us, blaming the faults
	on the Mirror, unable to see those flaws in themselves. So our Clan earns
	the fury-born of envy from all who flock to the banner of evil. Pity them
	and, when necessary, eliminate them, but you cannot stop evil by destroying
	evil people alone. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>So you wish to follow the virtues we espouse? Honor your Clan? It is a
	steep hill to climb. Sacrifice is frequent. Compassion is difficult to hold
	dear when those of evil mien exploit any sign of tenderness, but to be
	relentless, uncompromising&#133; this does not serve our goals. We would
	be little more than the mercenary Warclaw or the ruthless Blackmoon. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>We live in a world of great potential, but there are those that do not
	value life. To them, be you a good wife, a child, or a brave warrior matters
	naught. We can teach you how to wield your blade, to cast magic many have
	forgotten&#133; to mend flesh and knit bone. In time, you will learn the
	cost of sacrifice&#133; and the liberation the virtues bring. There is no
	freedom that can rival knowing your actions are just.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>If you wish to be a member of the Clan Justice, your path will be fraught
	with peril and temptation. Follow the light even when the Stygian night obscures
	it. If you falter, you will fall. If you fall, strive to fly again. You have
	the look of nobility about you, a gleam in your eye. Perhaps you will become
	the next legend among our kind.</I>

	<I><B>Code of Conduct</B>:</I>
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    <P ALIGN=Left>
	    <I>Never betray anyone, not even your enemies. Converse with those of the
	    darkness only when the greater good will be served, and even then be wary
	    of the corruption and hate they foster.</I>
	  <LI>
	    <P ALIGN=Left>
	    <I>Always tell the truth. The truth is always better than a lie.</I>
	  <LI>
	    <P ALIGN=Left>
	    <I>Protect everyone. Those whom go against the light should be destroyed.</I>
	  <LI>
	    <P ALIGN=Left>
	    <I>Law is a tool to preserve order and weal. The light flourishes in a lawful
	    society. Follow the laws of the land when they are just, and shun the lands
	    in which they are not. You are the role-model for change in such places.
	    Practice temperance.</I>
	  <LI>
	    <P ALIGN=Left>
	    <I>Take prisoners. There is always hope, but do not risk those who rely upon
	    you needlessly. Those who live by the sword will die by it when they are
	    blinded by wickedness.</I>
	  <LI>
	    <P ALIGN=Left>
	    <I>Never strike an opponent in the back or attack a defenseless opponent.
	    There is no honor in it. </I>
