	<I><B>History</B>: Blackmoon actually has a long and varied history, dating
	back to the prehistory of the Isles. One constant has been the influence
	of dr&#146;Shivrehel Despana, known as Dirge. Clan Blackmoon stems from his
	beliefs and dedication to the House, and it has endured through the Isles,
	Neverwinter, Sosaria, and now faces Norrath.</I>

	<I><B>Dogma</B>: Why are you bothering me? You seek what? Knowledge! Knowledge
	is only as good as the mind that wields it, but I will indulge you. Perhaps
	you can see past your own limitations. The other clans consider us isolationists,
	reclusive and bitter hermits. It is true that we prefer our own company;
	we value our privacy greatly and resent intrusions. When we must deal with
	those in the light, we tend to be quick to anger. Our senses are far more
	acute and this makes us sensitive to what most do not see&#133; the ceaseless
	approach of death; the reign of decay.</I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>How can you be so blind? Our survival is paramount. In the darkness, there
	is solace from the piercing brightness. In the silence, there is opportunity
	to contemplate, plot and dream, freedom from the cacophony of the fools.
	When we emerge, it is to gather power, to hunt and make known the sanctity
	of our dwelling. If safety allows, we prefer to bless our enemies with a
	slow and painful death. Sometimes a tortured man left to live is more useful
	than a field of corpses, but a thousand heads on pikes can also leave a lasting
	impression. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>We are a cunning people. Risks are for fools. We use the shadows to protect
	our secrets and delude our foes. Some of our rank use the arcane magic of
	necromancy to create undead servitors that do not question our will; they
	obey because it is our right to give orders-another sign of our mastery over
	that which others fear. </I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>All is not bleak. What is not to laugh at? All around us, death embraces
	the sightless. There is nothing more entertaining than the dawning recognition
	that there is no hope&#133; only decay. Most crumble under the realization
	they will be rotted flesh and bone one day. We learn to dominate it and make
	the fallen remains of others dance to our whim. Speaking of whim, would you
	care to dance? </I>
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	<I>We are sensual creatures. We see what others do not, the beauty of pleasure
	and pain. Rather than turning away from the rot, we embrace those who see
	the world against a dark moon. We are the enlightened. We are the teachers
	of what is beyond life. Embrace our way now and become more than you ever
	dreamed of; choose a different path, and learn in your passing that more
	than life can be lost. You can sacrifice your soul to our greatness. </I>

	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    <P ALIGN=Left>
	    <I>Betrayal of your Clan and the Clan's ambitions is unthinkable. Never betray
	    a true friend. Acquaintances however, are another matter, and how common
	    are true friends?</I>
	  <LI>
	    <P ALIGN=Left>
	    <I>The truth is a delicate flower. It requires just the right parts of light
	    and water. Too much of either will kill it. By that token, revealing secrets
	    can be your death; use the truth carefully. Your word is important to you
	    only because it might affect how others trust you. Give your word freely
	    to anyone you disrespect - who cares if they will think badly of you? Sooner
	    or later, they'll end up dead.</I>
	  <LI>
	    <P ALIGN=Left>
	    <I>Protect your clan's interests, protect your interests, and manipulate
	    others' to work towards your interests. It doesn't matter if they understand
	    them or not. Anyone who can&#146;t benefit you is meat.</I>
	  <LI>
	    <P ALIGN=Left>
	    <I>Laws are established by those with the strength to enforce them. If they
	    aren't strong, substitute your own laws; otherwise, adhere to them. </I>
	  <LI>
	    <P ALIGN=Left>
	    <I>Killing an innocent, or many, can help spread word of your name. If fear
	    is what you desire, then make their deaths as offensive and public as
	    possible.</I>
	  <LI>
	    <P ALIGN=Left>
	    <I>Torture is a useful and sometimes fun tool. After all, your victims will
	    probably serve you better in death. </I>
