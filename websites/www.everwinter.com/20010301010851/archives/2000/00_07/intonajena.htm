<I>Shiver couldn&#146;t help but thinking how repulsive a lair Najena had
built herself. The decorations were atrocious, tacky to the point of offending
even her ogre guards. He suspected her taste had more to do with her banishment
from Neriak than any real craving for power, but such reflection wasn&#146;t
the purpose of the House the past day.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Amorsaylnn&#146;s visit to Neriak had unearthed a rumor that Najena had
part of Winter&#146;s journal. Prepared or not, the House had to strike,
and so they did, though not to the depths of the magician&#146;s home. Amorsalynn
and Trespare had made some initial forays into the depths. Soon, reinforcements
arrived in the form of the mighty dwarven warrior, Balkin, and Keldore, easily
able to transverse the length and breadth of Norrath via his magic.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Shar and the dark elf had been forced to make the long run from the northern
reaches of the plains of Karana. The necromancer had crept through High Pass,
cloaked in shadows, and was almost happy that the guards hadn&#146;t spotted
him&#151;not that the grim one showed a great deal of emotion. They waited
until day-break in Kithicor having no interest in tangling with the undead
minions that slipped from the entrance to the Plane of Hate, then raced across
the Common lands and into Nektulos forest.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The corrupted lands of the Teir&#146;dal was the first place Shiver felt
relatively safe in a very long time. Cursory glances at him wouldn&#146;t
reveal his blasphemy and the guards&#151;either dragoons or golems&#151;would
actually protect him. His consort-child, Shar, had to use the blessings of
the Wolf to outrun a small detachment of guards on her way to the wastes
of Lavastorm. Najena&#146;s home was carved into the blasted basalt of that
fire-cursed place, and soon Shiver and Shar sat preparing themselves before
the massive doors, one blasted from its hinges. They quickly met with the
others of the House, then made forays deep into the dungeon.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>They faced countless undead servants and many ogre guards, eventually
defeating the likes of ogre officers, an undead froglok necromancer of some
sort, a tentacle terror, and even some ranking servants of the witch. It
was during their siege on the lair of the necromancer known as Trazdon that
Shiver fell, albeit not far. The Lady whisked him away, back to the gates
of the lair when the fell creature turned his attention on the wounded dark
elf. Keldore returned to the entrance, escorting the weakened Teir&#146;dal
to his equipment&#133; and a prize, held by Trespare.</I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>She had smiled, handing him the dark circlet that radiated power. "Enjoy
it, brother." He accepted the prize, removing the batfang headband Amorsaylnn
had given him a season before. He felt the rush of endowment the circlet
held, smiling slightly. They had not faced Najena down, nor confirmed the
presence of Winter&#146;s influence, but the House had fared well, claiming
a barbed leather whip of fearsome ability from the froglok and a pair of
lesser whips from tentacle-terrors, as well. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>It wasn&#146;t a step closer to an answer, but it was a step closer to
real power. And Shiver knew the value of power&#133; it would force the answers
from those who stood in their way.</I>
