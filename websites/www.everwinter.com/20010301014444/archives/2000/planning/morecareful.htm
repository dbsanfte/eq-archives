<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The elf on the docks of Qeynos groaned and stretched after rising. Blinking
and licking his salted lips, Keldore vaguely remebered how he got here. It
had something to do with the fishing pole lying on the ground beside him,
and the empty mead bottles next to it. No use dwelling on the past, he decided.
Gathering his things, headed for the bank. He didn't like carrying this pole
around with him. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Depositing his things, Keldore began planning his day. While scarfing
down a few nutritious but un-delicious rations, and gulping down an entire
flask of water, he decided to prey on the gnolls of Blackburrow. They seemed
to be launching many more frequent and powerful attacks as of late. It was
probably due to all the so-called adventurers slaughtering them. They deserved
it though. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>One, two, three, four corpses lie at the entrance to the tunnel joining
Blackburrow to the Qeynos Hills. A strange site it used to be, but becoming
all too usual. One, two, three, four corpses pilled up around the wizard,
felled by his moderately powerful spells and inadequate combat abilities.
It was a bit exhausting, and Keldore decided to take a break and regather
his energies, both physical and magical. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>He found a nice corner in the gnoll home, and sat down. His inviting spellbook
was opened in his lap and he began studying once again. The pages began to
swirl, but he dismissed it as the lingering effects of last night's party.
They began to flip wildly, before coming to rest upon those dealing with
cold and ice. These rose from the pages, nipping at him with their chill.
While this weak body felt pain, the silver dragon soul within reveled. The
mind wondered just what was happening. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The answer came in a voice that was inviting, yet domineering. The rocky
scape around him faded to a cavern of snow and ice. His feet danced to the
voice, bringing him to his feet. "Welcome to my home." </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Keldore found himself staring up at one of the most beautiful sites he
had yet to see on Norrath. It nearly shattered his heart to see the great
dragon that loomed over him, the pain of losing his draconic abilities and
shape still fresh. At once he knew her name, from rumors across the land,
from annals in the library of Erudin, and from the presence he had felt since
coming to this world. "Thank you, My Lady Vox." </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Studying ones spells requires the opening of the mind. Just about anyone
with the inclination and power to do so could follow the streaming magical
words, gestures, and patterns into Keldore's brain. He had already been studied
and accepted, but like the others she had already contacted, he needed to
be shown the vision and be Winterborne. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>The carnage soon to be wrought in the world was like a hammer blow to
the wizard, who thought the world was streaming along nicely. The vision
was not doubted, however. Once the signs were pointed out for him, he could
see the picture. He accepted the position offered to him by the Lady, happily
once he learned that some of his friends had done so already. </I>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<I>Snapping shut the spellbook and rising, he once again began battling the
gnolls, this time with a different purpose. </I>
