	      The First Borne are semi-draconian powers. Dragons are, from a mythological
	      point of view, "sky gods," but they are also tied in with the old sky god
	      that is replaced by the bull or new sky god. See the "Great Goddess" theory.
	      Essentially, males vie for their place in the fertility cycle, replacing
	      the old with the new. On an interesting side note, the disposed god is cut
	      to pieces with a jagged sickle, and used to fertilize the ground (and that's
	      a conservative summary), and most patriarchal deities derive from this primal
	      myth--Odin, Vulcan, Yehweh, and&#133; Christianity's Jesus Christ. I'm not
	      saying any religion is less valid, but building a mythos around this universal
	      mythology is a pretty solid way to give it depth in a short amount of time.
	      Ultimately, however, we distance ourselves with the "Source" idea as agnostic.
	      The First Born are semi-divine, a mass of demi-powers in TSR terminology,
	      eager to assure their place and dispose the Elder
	      Powers.</BIG></FONT></I></BIG><FONT SIZE=4><BIG> </BIG></FONT>

	      bodies, virtual immunity to weapons and magic, powerful forms of attack,
	      and a control of magic. Current "dragons" that haven't re-established their
	      connection with the "Source" remain somewhat weaker, bound by de-evolution
	      and the control of the Powers, but Conclave wyrms should be more powerful
	      (in a versatile way). While their abilities aren't vastly improved, their
	      control of magic and innate abilities are more powerful. This makes a big
	      boost for the weaker dragon types. My implied assumption is that the "Source"
	      guided the creation of dragons. As for the other races, some of the First

	      There really is no way of knowing. The Conclave draws power from the Source,
	      but their guesses as to the nature and ambition (if any?) of the Source are
	      pure speculation. Conclave Riadaim should pass through stages (just like
	      dragons) to become more "in touch" with the Source, providing them enhanced
	      abilities. What? The two most significant are the "racial" memory/lore and
	      greatly minimized aging. As to whether aging stops, that's unlikely. Dragons
	      age; so do their counterparts. However, a Conclave dwarf living 1200 years
	      or more might not be unlikely. This isn't immortality, mind you. A sharp
	      blade through a kidney can end the life of said dwarf like any other, but
	      the slow mastery of necromantic abilities and the imbuing with energy will
	      eventually make such a sword blow less and less debilitating. Example, stabbing
	      Dirge's seeming with a dragon slayer blade might hurt him, but ultimately
	      even scattering his ashes isn't going to prevent him from reforming and seeking
	      vengeance. This works particularly well in many game settings (like UO) where

	      three Radiant-loyal clans. At the same time, Dirge leads a counter-strike
	      against a half a dozen isolated Radiant clans. ys'Mykell, the Radiant, Dirge
	      and Cz meet to discuss a peace accord. Mykell resumes her functions as Custodian
	      over a united Conclave and Council. The Radiant replaces Valator, but is
	      not content. In the next few months the Radiant subverts many clans by tampering
	      with the Orbs of Io, placing a powerful charm upon them. Dirge discovers
	      and leads the Conclave in a battle against the Radiant, attempting to break
	      the charm. In the battle against the Radiant's charmed dragons, the Orbs
