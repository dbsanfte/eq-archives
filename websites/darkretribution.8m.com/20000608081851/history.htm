      was bright sunny day across the lands of Norrath, a day where the Dark Elves 
      prefer to stay in the shadows waiting for the calmness and stealth of night. 
      This day was the perfect day for the human invading party. The sun hit high 
      noon and the raiders from Qeynos attacked the guards. The Dragoon Guard 
      put up a valiant fight even though the numbers of humans in the siege quickly 
      overwhelmed them. The human invaders swept through Nektulos Forest and into 
      the main city of Neriak, killing many of the residents and merchants of 
      Neriak, and kidnapping carefully selected members of the Neriak Elder Council.</font></td>

      an apprentice Cleric, was hunting around Neriak with three of his long time 
      friends when the attack took place. Dmizzar, an apprentice Necromancer, 
      Xyanthon, an apprentice Shadowknight, and Shimmerdark, an apprentice Wizard. 
      During their hunting trips, Wliab was often outspoken about his ideas on 
      the teachings of their God, told his friends about his philosophy. He told 
      them of his disagreement with the Elder Council, a source of agitation between 
      Wliab and his father, and his hatred of the "false-guilds" currently controlling 
      that Council. He felt that these false guilds were watering down the pure 
      race that Innoruuk called for and their acceptance of non-evil members were 
      leading to the downfall of the Dark-Elven race. Although his hunting partners 
      were sympathetic to Wliab's ideas, they were somewhat skeptical. This philosophy 
      had made him an outcast in Neriak and most viewed him as a radical, or fanatic.</font></td>

        of Qeynos. To compound his misery he found the body of his wife, beaten 
        and broken by the humans, left with an ominous but clear message on her 
        body on the street outside of his house. The humans would be back</font><font size="3" color="#990000">.</font></p>

      <p><font size="3" color="#990000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        four hunters quickly met to plan their attack on the small village outside 
        Qeynos, but the remaining Elders got wind of the plan and paid a visit 
        to Wliab and his team. The acting Lead Elder explained to the group that 
        the Elders were waiting for a sign from Innoruuk, as to whether or not 
        any action should be taken. He went on to forbid any action against Qeynos 
        or humankind until such a time as a sign from Innoruuk was given to them. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" color="#990000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wliab 
        was stunned and incredulous. He pleaded to his hunting partners to help 
        him get his father and baby daughter back from the village. He spoke to 
        them of the dark retribution that they must carry out. He told them that 
        the Council would never proceed and time was of the essence. The time 
        for retribution was now; it was time for the humans to feel the darkness 
        of Innoruuk's wrath.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" color="#990000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, 
        they all agreed and set out on their mission. Under the cover of darkness, 
        the hunters approached the village and attacked the humans. All went well 
        with the attack they were successful in finding Tlaan, Morania, and the 
        others kidnapped by the humans. They were able to kill everyone in the 
        village. Wliab had made it clear before the attack that all must meet 
        the wrath of Innoruuk, but Xyanthon, searching for any survivors, came 
        across a newborn infant and did not have the heart to kill him. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" color="#990000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wliab 
        was furious, and took his evilly blessed Bloodforge Hammer out, ready 
        to sacrifice the squalling and obviously terrified child on the spot. 
        Tlaan quietly walked over and stayed his hand, having his own form of 
        retribution in mind. He named the baby Sarzek and decided that the baby 
        would become a Shadowknight. Tlaan was determined to turn this human into 
        an enemy of humans, raising the pale baby as a Dark Elf would be raised, 
        to hate all humankind. He felt that he would then have his own brand of 
        dark retribution. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" color="#990000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Upon 
        their return to Neriak, the Elder Council admonished the four hunters 
        for their disregard of the laws of the land. Tlaan stepped in and was 
        able to persuade the Council to pardon them. From that point on Wliab 
        knew that he must do what he could to change the path of the Council and 
        Guilds in Neriak. Tlaan was able to convince Wliab to hold his tongue 
        and wait until the time was right. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" color="#990000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Years 
        passed, everyone went their own ways and continued to hone their skills. 
        Tlaan raised Sarzek to hate everything that humanity stood for. Morania 
        became a rogue against Wliab's wishes. He had wanted her to stay within 
        the family's chosen vocation and be a Cleric, as had been many generations 
        of D'sai before. However, as all young people do, her stage of rebellion 
        and bitterness about her mother led her to the path she ended up following. 
        Wliab eventually came to see that Morania, instead of being the healer 
        her father was, had become a deadly weapon in the fight against the pale 
        races. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" color="#990000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
        the interim, it was discovered that the High Elves had been the ones to 
        provide locations and strategic information to the Qeynos City Council, 
        precipitating the attack, and in Wliab and those who were with him, a 
        resounding hatred of those pale cousins grew enormous.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" color="#990000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sarzek 
        grew tall and large, and fell in with a somewhat questionable crowd, which 
        eventually formed a Guild. Morania, seeing the problems that could come 
        from her childhood friend being in this organization, pleaded with her 
        father and grandfather to help convince him to leave this false Guild. 
        After much consideration, Wliab decided that it was time to form the clan 
        he had been born to lead. </font></p>
