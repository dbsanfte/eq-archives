            was bright sunny day across the lands of Norrath, a day where the 
            Dark Elves prefer to stay in the shadows waiting for the calmness 
            and stealth of night. This day was the perfect day for the human invading 
            party. The sun hit high noon and the raiders from Qeynos attacked 
            the guards. The Dragoon Guard put up a valiant fight even though the 
            numbers of humans in the siege quickly overwhelmed them. The human 
            invaders swept through Nektulos Forest and into the main city of Neriak, 
            killing many of the residents and merchants of Neriak, and kidnapping 
            carefully selected members of the Neriak Elder Council. </font></p>

        <div align="left">
          <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">W</font><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">liab, 
            an apprentice Cleric, was hunting around Neriak with three of his 
            long time friends when the attack took place. Dmizzar, an apprentice 
            Necromancer, Xyanthon, an apprentice ShadowKnight, and Shimmerdark, 
            an apprentice Wizard. During their hunting trips, Wliab was often 
            outspoken about his ideas on the teachings of their God, told his 
            friends about his philosophy. He told them of his disagreement with 
            the Elder Council, a source of agitation between Wliab and his father, 
            and his hatred of the "false-guilds" currently controlling that Council. 
            He felt that these false guilds were watering down the pure race that 
            Innoruuk called for and their acceptance of non-evil members were 
            leading to the downfall of the Dark-Elven race. Although his hunting 
            partners were sympathetic to Wliab's ideas, they were somewhat skeptical. 
            This philosophy had made him an outcast in Neriak and most viewed 
            him as a radical, or fanatic. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">Wliab's beliefs 
            were finally put to the test when the hunting party returned to Neriak 
            to see the carnage that remained from the human raiding party. Although 
            all lost family members, Wliab was the most devastated. His father, 
            Tlaan, a Cleric of much power, and standing member of the Elder Council, 
            and his baby daughter, Morania, were kidnapped and taken to a village 
            outside of Qeynos. To compound his misery he found the body of his 
            wife, beaten and broken by the humans, left with an ominous but clear 
            message on her body on the street outside of his house. The humans 
            would be back. </font></p>
        </div>
        <div align="left">
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">The four hunters 
            quickly met to plan their attack on the small village outside Qeynos, 
            but the remaining Elders got wind of the plan and paid a visit to 
            Wliab and his team. The acting Lead Elder explained to the group that 
            the Elders were waiting for a sign from Innoruuk, as to whether or 
            not any action should be taken. He went on to forbid any action against 
            Qeynos or humankind until such a time as a sign from Innoruuk was 
            given to them. Wliab was stunned and incredulous. He pleaded to his 
            hunting partners to help him get his father and baby daughter back 
            from the village. He spoke to them of the dark retribution that they 
            must carry out. He told them that the Council would never proceed 
            and time was of the essence. The time for retribution was now; it 
            was time for the humans to feel the darkness of Innoruuk's wrath. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">Finally, they all 
            agreed and set out on their mission. Under the cover of darkness, 
            the hunters approached the village and attacked the humans. All went 
            well with the attack they were successful in finding Tlaan, Morania, 
            and the others kidnapped by the humans. They were able to kill everyone 
            in the village. Wliab had made it clear before the attack that all 
            must meet the wrath of Innoruuk, but Xyanthon, searching for any survivors, 
            came across a newborn infant and did not have the heart to kill him. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">Wliab was furious, 
            and took his evilly blessed Bloodforge Hammer out, ready to sacrifice 
            the squalling and obviously terrified child on the spot. Tlaan quietly 
            walked over and stayed his hand, having his own form of retribution 
            in mind. He named the baby Sarzek and decided that the baby would 
            become a Shadowknight. Tlaan was determined to turn this human into 
            an enemy of humans, raising the pale baby as a Dark Elf would be raised, 
            to hate all humankind. He felt that he would then have his own brand 
            of dark retribution. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">Upon their return 
            to Neriak, the Elder Council admonished the four hunters for their 
            disregard of the laws of the land. Tlaan stepped in and was able to 
            persuade the Council to pardon them. From that point on Wliab knew 
            that he must do what he could to change the path of the Council and 
            Guilds in Neriak. Tlaan was able to convince Wliab to hold his tongue 
            and wait until the time was right. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">Years passed, everyone 
            went their own ways and continued to hone their skills. Tlaan raised 
            Sarzek to hate everything that humanity stood for. Morania became 
            a rogue against Wliab's wishes. He had wanted her to stay within the 
            family's chosen vocation and be a Cleric, as had been many generations 
            of D'sai before. However, as all young people do, her stage of rebellion 
            and bitterness about her mother led her to the path she ended up following. 
            Wliab eventually came to see that Morania, instead of being the healer 
            her father was, had become a deadly weapon in the fight against the 
            pale races. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">In the interim, 
            it was discovered that the High Elves had been the ones to provide 
            locations and strategic information to the Qeynos City Council, precipitating 
            the attack, and in Wliab and those who were with him, a resounding 
            hatred of those pale cousins grew enormous. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">Sarzek grew tall 
            and large, and fell in with a somewhat questionable crowd, which eventually 
            formed a Guild. Morania, seeing the problems that could come from 
            her childhood friend being in this organization, pleaded with her 
            father and grandfather to help convince him to leave this false Guild. 
            It is time for the darkness to prevail, to feel the wrath of darkness. 
            The night of retribution is now at hand; Dark Retribution shall prevail.</font></p>
