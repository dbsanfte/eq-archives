Breaking any of the following rules will result in a one month probation period. Breaking a rule during a probation period will result in removal. 3rd time offenders will be removed from the guild. Capernicus will be the judge and executioner. If I'm indecisive I will consult with the senators on deciding a course of disciplinary action. A unanimous vote of the Senate is required to create new rules and to ammend the rules in effect. A rule can only be vetoed by Capernicus, a unanimous vote of the senate, or a 75 percent popular vote by the Guild.

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;When attending a DRR raid, a DRR event, or a DRR ally raid, you are require to understand the following: Never complain about experience or loot. If you are not satisfied with the raid or event you are on, before expressing your negativity about the raid to the raid, leave the raid. You are free to leave the raid whenever you decide, provided you have an escort, port, tl, or gate potion. Usually we can get you out of the zone without a problem so when you want to go just let the raid leader know.  Remember, stay until you want to go, but never complain about the raid, just leave if you are not happy.  Complaining at multiple raids will break rule #1.
<br><br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;No disrespect toward any Guildies, Officers, Senators, as well as, Nonguildies. (if you are reported 3 times for camp stealing, bad behavior, KSing, etc., by nonguildies you will be removed from the guild on grounds of bad integerity. Remember if you wear the DRR badge you represent that DRR badge and your actions reflect not only the quality of your integrety but the guilds as well. DRR has great integerity and we wont allow it to be destroyed by allowing guildies to express negativity toward the everquest community. My advice is to express positivity, kindness, love, happiness, and compassion not only to your fellow Raiders but to everyone. Be proud to be a Raider, and represent the guild with a positive perspective is all I ask.
<br><br>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bragging about rank such as Officer or Senator positions will not be tolerated. Although the guild is stratified by our levels it is important to understand that we are all worthy of equal respect. Rubbing your status in another guildies face is completely disrespectful, and thinking that you are better than someone else because of your status in the guild is completely pathetic. Simply said, dont throw your status in anyones face and you wont look like a fool and get disbanded.
<br><br>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Excessive begging is not allowed within or outside the guild.  I, as well as the Raiders, donate old gear and equipment to the Treasury in order to help out younger raiders in their leveling. The Armory displays available free and rentable(free-of-charge) items that can be picked up in bazaar. Free items do not have to be returned but rentable items should be returned to the armory when you outgrow it so that it can be passed on to someone else. Records are kept which show who donated the item and who is using it and it is up to you to return the item when done or if you decide to leave the guild. Of course anyone who abuses the priviledge of the Armory by selling the rented gear will be disbanded. We set the Armory up so that you would not have to beg...so dont.   8).
<br><br>
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Profanity within guild chat and around younger guildies should be minimal. Four letter words they are indeed, and that is all they are, but from certain perspectives they are also percieved as expressions of negativity such as anger, and can be disturbing in that sense. We ask that you keep profanity to yourself and out of guild chat as much as possible, and most certainly, do not express profanity toward anyone while wearing the Raider tag. The Guild as a whole should not be represented by your actions in that manner. Just remember that love spreads happiness where as hate will only stimulate anger and more hate....I think.... /checks his dictionary. 
<br><br>
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dishonesty towards guildies and others will not be tolerated. There will be times when guildies loan and borrow money. If you borrow money from a guildie or someone and they expect to be payed back then pay them back and you wont be at risk of being disbanded. Simply said, thieves are not welcome in DRR.
