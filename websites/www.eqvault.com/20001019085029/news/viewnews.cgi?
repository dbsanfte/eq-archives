Jhared issued the following report to us:<BLOCKQUOTE>Last night in Qeynos Hills, Protector Holly Windstalker notified us of Cros Treewind's death.<br><br>She informed us that a defiled Grizzly Bear (the mate of Mammoth) had in fact killed and eaten Cros.<br><br>She asked for us all to search for the bear.<br><br>Our guild, the House of Irsei, who were traveling through the Hills on our way to Qeynos sprang into action. Our tracker, Surfal Dayspring quickly caught the trail and we followed him through the Hills to a secluded spot near the fishing pond. There we found the Defiled Grizzly. It was a huge bear and we discovered it was no easy prey. After what seemed to be a very long time, we finally overcame the beast.<br><br>It was the mighty hand of our best warrior, Gilthalas Bella which slew the maddened animal and cheers went out across the Hills in Gilthalas' name.<br><br>Inside the beast's belly, our leader Ulandra found a horrifying discovery -- Cros Treewind's staff. This removed any doubt that he had in fact fallen victim to the very thing he had fought so hard to protect.<br><br>Shortly thereafter, Protector Holly held a rememberence service outisde Surefall Glade for the lost Druid, who she said had been the epitome of a Jaggedpine Treeman. Although there was some grumbling amongst those gathered that Cros had been a self-righteous bully, everyone said kind words on his behalf and Gilthalas and his sister Trina Bella approached Holly. They presented her with the staff and she was overcome with emotion.<br><br>After thanking Gilthalas and Trina profusely, she also presented them with a gift -- A Bag of the Tinkerers.<br><br>She thanked each member of our order who were on hand as well, who were as follows:<br><br><i>Arsindrick Tabasheer<br>Mortavious Valorous<br>Trina Bella<br>Gilthalas Bella<br>Ulandra<br>Surfal Dayspring<br>Redwyn<br>Jhared Irsei </i><br> <br>and our dear friends Yora of the Dark Knights of Justice and Valarie Freistvalkyry of the Celestial Keepers. <br>  <br>Jhared Irsei<br><a href="mailto:jhared@longroadjournals.com">jhared@longroadjournals.com</a><uL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/holly1.jpg">Screenshot #1</a><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/holly2.jpg">Screenshot #2</a></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Lefourgue informed me of the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>THE LOST SCROLL<br>A Roleplay event on Mithaniel Marr<br>When: Friday the 20h of October, from 3 PM to 6 PM (EST)<br>Where: East Commons, on Mithaniel Marr<br>Who: Lvl 6-10 characters<br><br>From Lefourgue Beauregard, head of the Lodge of Bayle:<br><br>Our investigation on the rumoured return of Miragul led us to study ancient<br>texts and records, relating the tragic tale of the woman who opened her arms<br>and her books of arcane lore for him. She was a Teir'Dal sorceress, the<br>first of her kind to tread so far on the forbidden path of Necromancy.<br>Her name was Argarwaen. A daughter of Neriak's royal family, she had no lust<br>for secular power, only for the surge of tainted mana and the thrill of<br>playing hide and seek with Death itself. Unwilling to play the political<br>game she was taught as a potential heir to the throne, she left her hometown<br>for newfound Erudin.<br><br>Her true nature disguised by powerful illusions, she learned much from the<br>Human mages. To those who had a dark shard stuck in their hearts, she taught<br>the rudiments of her own art. Thus, she built a court of followers. It is<br>well known how Miragul joined this secret college of outcasts. But few are<br>those who know that he became the lover of the Teir'Dal princess.<br>When the war broke out between the Erudites and the Heretics, Miragul fled<br>north. As for Argarwaen, she left Odus and built herself an underground<br>palace in what is now known as the Commonlands. There, our sources diverge.<br>Some scholars pretend she became mad out of waiting for her lover's return,<br>others hint that she was cursed by Miragul himself because she had failed<br>him in one way of another, and a third school of thought suggests that Death<br>is not without its sick sense of humour, and that the Great Harvester of<br>Souls refused to sever Argarwaen's lifecord, sentencing the Dark Elf to an<br>eternity of torment. However, all agree on their conclusion: Argarwaen's<br>spirit never found peace.<br><br>What is the relevance of this story with our current research you may ask.<br>Well, learn that our Erudite brethren from Paineel have unearthed a long<br>forgotten scroll which could allow us to summon Argarwaen's restless ghost<br>and ask her about Miragul's whereabouts!<br><br>Alas, the scroll has been stolen by a perfidious shadowknight named<br>Filsdebayle. We tracked the traitor, cornered him in East Commons and killed<br>him, but the precious document was nowhere to find. Further investigation<br>led us to believe that it is now in the hands of the Deathfist Orcs, with<br>whom Filsdebayle had contracted an alliance...<br><br>/ooc GameLoft, a French site dedicated to EverQuest, invites all level 6-10<br>characters to attend its third in-game event, which will start in East<br>Commonlands, and culminate in Befallen. We promise you thrill, romance,<br>blood, spectacular lightshow and free beer! More precious gifts will also<br>reward the heroes of the event. Departure will take place at the Nektulos<br>pass in EC, but if you are late, you can join us at Orc 2 (until 4 PM). <br>To join in, please indicate your class, race and level to Radharc<br>[eobert@gameloft.com].

Lady Dae stopped by and responded to a few threads recently on the Arena board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/harpys-head/Forum9/HTML/000071.html"><b>Recent Bard Tournament</b></a><br>Do I expect a level 29 to defeat a level 39? <br><br>No I do not. <br><br>Do I expect a level 29 to enter the event for knowledge, learning, and to have fun, so that in future events he can do better? <br><br>Yes I do. <br><br>We are trying to make things fun for as many players as possible. This means that there needs to be a wide spread of levels. While I would love to keep it +/- 4 levels (Rallos Zek range), we are trying to get the excitement out to everyone. <br><br>We are aware of the level differences involved in the match. This is the best we can do with still having a decent size event, Im sorry. <br><br>We are aware of the twinking, and how they ruin events, but unless the items are obsene for their level, we are leaving them alone. Again, my appologies. <br><br>To give a breakdown on every piece of equipment that a player can and cannot have at level X is impossible. The GMs are allowed to use judgement on items that are way out of range, and ask the player to put those items away. <br><br>The issue that saddens me here is that no where in your wonderful post did you say you had fun. <br><br>We will work on making things better in the future, see you in the arena.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/harpys-head/Forum9/HTML/000074.html"><b>Short Notice on Tallon Zek</b></a><br>I have heard a lot of complaints about the limited warning on Tallon Zek. I have not yet heard any complaints about the Nameless Event that was also run today. <br><br>I will look into this matter and contact the Server Management Team of Tallon Zek and see if there was a breakdown in communication between the events staff and the Tallon Zek population. <br><br>While I would love to hold all events on the weekend, The Events staff at this time is not capable of fullfilling that request. If I had a team of 35 EventMasters, I would run them all on the weekend I assure you. <br><br>If I find out that Tallon Zek had little to no knowledge of the event before it was run, I will consider a second event and sending a second team to the finals. <br><br>This is still based on the results of the investigation that will be run, no promises at this time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/harpys-head/Forum9/HTML/000081.html"><b>Required Levels</b></a><br>There have been just as many, if not more, events given to the less then 50s then the greater then 50s. <br><br>At this time we do not give a lot of advanced warning on minor events, and just enough time on major events, so that the events can actually run. <br><br>If we gave a month warning for a mid level event, 300 people would show up and we would not be able to run it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/harpys-head/Forum9/HTML/000075.html"><b>Test of Tactics - Day One</b></a><br>Tallon Zek Winners : The Patryns<br>Tallon Zek Field Size : 8 Teams (55 Players) <br><br>Lazdal the Tactician (59 BAR SHA) <br><br>Tssunami (56 HUM MONK)<br>Druegan (55 DWA CLE)<br>Cuick the Silent(59 ELF ROG)<br>Lightadam (56 HIE WIZ)<br>Kreepindeath (58 HUM ENC)<br>Dumnezeu (53 HUM CLE) <br><br>The Nameless Winners : Legacy of Steel<br>The Nameless Field Size : 4 Teams (26 Players) <br><br>Tenaj the Tactician (60 DEL WIZ) <br><br>Magosian (59 HUM WIZ)<br>Ariel (60 ELF WAR)<br>Arlos (57 HUM MONK)<br>Vertulias (56 TRO WAR)<br>Barnabuss (60 DWA CLE) <br><br>This team waived the 7th person, which is within the rules. <br><br>Rule Change was made that if players wish to enter without the 5kpp entry fee, they may do so but waive their rights to prizes. <br><br>I will not be announcing the prizes of the event, if players wish to do so, that is their right. <br><br>More to come tomorrow, finalized scheduel will be posted tonight.</UL>

Alan "Absor" VanCouvering spoke briefly concerning his name on the EverQuest Gameplay Board.  Here's the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/024488.html">post from the original thread</a>:<UL><i>I knew this would be a tough crowd. :)<br><br>My last name is Dutch in origin. I was born in California myself. My handle is the name of my second D&D character. I think a created it by shuffling the letters of some of the words printed on the binder that I kept my characters in. Of course that was a long time ago&#8230;<br><br>Alan</I></UL>

CoN has kicked up a <a href="http://con.xrgaming.net/brad.php3">new interview with Verant Vice President Brad McQuaid</a>.  The article features a few snapshots of Verant HQ as well as a few tidbits on Velious.  Here's a clip:<UL><i>Although we&#8217;ll see plenty of these new NPC&#8217;s, we won&#8217;t find any new player classes or races, focusing instead on adding hundreds of new quests. &#8220;The designers will be working up until the last minute and beyond putting as much content as possible,&#8221; assures Brad. &#8220;That&#8217;s usually our goal. How much is enough? There isn&#8217;t.&#8221; <br><br>When Kunark was released, players cheered because of the higher level limits that were added for characters. There&#8217;s no increase to the character level limit in Velious, but Brad hasn&#8217;t put the idea to rest. &#8220;Whether we decide to do one in the future or not, I can&#8217;t say for sure. There are a lot of variables involved. The more powerful creatures are fifty to sixtieth level, and we don&#8217;t want to let it get to the point where one player can just walk around killing dragons. That&#8217;s not immersive or &#8216;realistic&#8217; within the fiction.</i></UL>

Rbecka announces the following event:<BLOCKQUOTE>Name_Of_Submitter: Rbecka<br>Event_name: Nights of the Dying Undead<br>Email: <a href="mailto:rbecka@altavista.net">rbecka@altavista.net</a><br>Guild_Sponsoring_Event: Silver Daggers<br>Date: 11/11/2000<br>Time: 2:00 PM EST<br>Event_Description: Night of the Dying Undead<br><br>What: Raid on Kithicor (Karnan Server)<br>Who: Silver Daggers & all Allies (ammended to include all members of KCOG)<br>Level: 35+ (lower lvl (20-34) will be accepted, but may be posted at one of the zones in Kithicor &#8211; either WC, RV, or HH)<br>When: Saturday, Nov. 11th, 2 p.m. EST <br>Where: Meet in RiverVale<br><br>On Saturday, Nov 11th, at 2PM EST, the Silver Daggers along with all allies will be raiding Kithicor Forest. The raid is being organized by myself, Rbecka.. and Aalya (AKA &#8211; &#8216;The Sisters of Slash&#8217;) <br><br>Cassia, of the Silver Daggers, will be the battle commander for this raid. Watch for a follow-up post from her on how we will meet the raid's objectives.<br><br>Those needing teleports for the raid should contact me to arrange a ride. IMPORTANT: No teleports will be provided after the time listed above, unless it is during daylight hours.. as the primary hunt will be after dark.<br><br><br>The primary objective of the raid is to exact revenge on the massive quantities of undead that roam this zone and have been terrorizing folks for ages. Secondary objective will be, of course, whatever loot we can obtain and whatever experience can be gained. *** Note: it is highly possible due to the way this raid is going to be set up that your group may not gain very much in the way of experience. If this is objectionable to you, please make other arrangements for the day, because once groups are set up, if anyone leaves this could cause a major problem. (Can we say &#8216;don&#8217;t rock the boat&#8217;)?<br><br>Items will be lotto'd among the classes present who can use them using the /random 1 200 command. Ties will roll again. If no one present can use the item, the item will be lotto&#8217;d among the guilds present. When a lotto item is looted, the group leader should /tell me immediately what the item is. I will coordinate with the battle commander to hold the lotto between fights, with the group leader being responsible for handing off the item to the winner. Also &#8211; please note that there is a great deal of &#8216;no-drop&#8217; items in this zone &#8211; do not loot if you can not use it.<br><br>The group leaders will do all looting. (or a person designated by the group leader.) Split will be turned on, with gems & trinkets being donated to clerics & enchanters to help defray the cost of regents<br><br>Late arrivals to the raid should wait at the Rivervale zone and contact me via /tell. I will coordinate with the battle commander to have the person brought in. Under no circumstances should anyone try to reach the raiding party on their own. (Unless it is during daylight hours) Anyone who hears from a late arrival wishing to join the raid should send me a /tell with that information. If I do not respond in a reasonable amount of time, send the /tell again until I do acknowledge it. Late arrivals may have to wait a few minutes, but we will get them in to join the raid. All participants will be eligible for lottos and will receive an equal share of the group loot, butif you are a late arrival, you will not be eligible for the first lotto of an item that can be used by your class. (unless you are the only member of your class present)<br><br>The battle commander will designate a puller.(Hopefully with Kithicor experience.) Anyone wishing to learn from the designated puller should contact me via /tell once we have reached the area of the forest we will hold. I will coordinate with the battle commander and all requests to learn the area will be accommodated if at all possible.<br><br>All communication with me, as the raid organizer, will be via /tell, leaving the public channels open for use by the battle commander. As a reminder, we are attempting to increase our raid success rate by paying more attention to group and raid discipline. Players who repeatedly break discipline may be asked to leave the raid. Warnings, and removal from the raid in the unlikely event that it should become necessary, will be handled by me via /tell. <br><br>Official beverage for this hunt is my own personal favorite: Kalish. Feel free to bring as much as you wish, for there will be plenty of downtime during daylight hours.<br><br><br>Hope to see you all in Kithicor. May the &#8216;undead&#8217; die again <br><br>Signup list is posted at: <a href="http://pub3.ezboard.com/fsilverdaggersevents.showMessage?topicID=213.topic">http://pub3.ezboard.com/fsilverdaggersevents.showMessage?topicID=213.topic</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

A <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/024394.html">big announcement</a> was posted this evening to the Gameplay Board by Verant Interactive's Gordon Wrinn.  In this post he announces his promotion to Associate Producer of EQ Live and the Scars of Velious as well as welcoming Alan &#8220;Absor&#8221; VanCouvering, formly EQX's editor-in-chief, as his replacement.  Here's the complete letter:<UL><i>Hello all, <br><br>We've got a new producer letter going up here in the next few minutes. I thought I'd stop by here and post it special for those camping the boards <br><br>-Gordon<br><br>------<br><br>Hello all,<br><br>It seems like only yesterday that I came to Verant to build our community relations by acting as a two-way conduit of information between the players and the development team. In fact, it&#8217;s been nearly a year since I began representing the company to the players, and in return, the players to the company. <br><br>We&#8217;ve certainly had some bumps in the road, but overall I think that the development team and the community of players have grown much closer over the past year. We&#8217;ve addressed a lot of issues, solved a number of problems, and overall improved the game as a result of our relationship. We now have more development team members posting on the boards than ever before and our response time to issues in game has dropped dramatically. Furthermore, we&#8217;ve become much more flexible in terms of addressing everyone&#8217;s issues. We&#8217;ve seen a number of old bugs addressed, and implemented numerous enhancements, both those related to a particular class, and to the players as a whole. <br><br>Many of you have noticed that I&#8217;ve been around a little less than normal over the past couple of weeks. Some have gotten the impression that we&#8217;d become less resilient in our goal to maintain a strong community. I can now let everyone know that this is not the case, that our commitment to our players is stronger than ever, and that we remain committed to continually improving our relationship with EverQuest players.<br><br>Today I am pleased to announce that Alan &#8220;Absor&#8221; VanCouvering, formerly of EverQuest Express (eqx.simplenet.com), has joined the EverQuest Team. Alan will be taking over my position as Community Relations Manager of EverQuest, and will be responsible for taking our community relations to the next level. Alan has been the editor of EverQuest Express since early beta, and comes to us with nearly 10 years of customer service experience. Please make him feel at home and take it easy on him until he comes up to speed. Alan has posted an introduction below.<br><br>With Alan coming on, I&#8217;ve moved to the development team as Associate Producer of EQLive and the Scars of Velious, under Jeff Butler. I&#8217;ll be concentrating more on the &#8220;Live&#8221; side of things, with coordination of day-to-day operations of EverQuest being among my responsibilities. I&#8217;ll still stop by the boards from time to time, as they remain an excellent resource for information and player feedback, but Alan will be your point-man there. While I&#8217;m proud of the work we&#8217;ve done over the past year, I&#8217;m very excited about this new opportunity, and am equally glad that we were able to bring Alan on.<br><br>Thank you for giving me the opportunity to address your concerns and making me a part of your EverQuest experience. <br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Gordon &#8220;Abashi&#8221; Wrinn<br>Associate Producer, EQLive and the Scars of Velious<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.<br><br>-------<br><br>Hello everyone.<br><br>My name is Alan VanCouvering. As Gordon mentioned, I will be taking over as Community Relations Manager for EverQuest here at Verant Interactive, Inc.<br><br>Let me start by giving you an idea what it is that I will be doing under the auspice of the wordy title &#8220;Community Relations Manager&#8221;. It will be my job to understand the players&#8217; concerns about EverQuest and to get those concerns to the development team. It will also be my job to get responses to those concerns back to the players and to help the development team to speak with the community. There will be other tasks (I imagine there will be loads of other tasks), but that&#8217;s my primary job.<br><br>Until recently, very recently, I&#8217;ve been a player. I have been involved with EverQuest as a tester and a&#8230; commentator about the game since the early beta. Some of you may know me as Absor from EverQuest Express. I&#8217;m not going to claim to know everything that there is to know about the game. I don&#8217;t know where all the problems lie, and I don&#8217;t know all the good things. Of course I will be trying to absorb everything that I can from the designers here and from the players. But let me apologize now if I don&#8217;t know all the answers to your questions.<br><br>I hope that you will bring your concerns to me so that I can understand them. Don&#8217;t be afraid to over-explain something to me. And don&#8217;t be too surprised if I ask for clarifications on a point or two. I haven&#8217;t played all the classes to 60th level, so I may not understand the problems with &#8220;x&#8221; item or &#8220;y&#8221; class from personal experience. I am, however, certain that I can understand them if they are explained to me.<br><br>I&#8217;ve also learned that I have a somewhat conversational style when writing for public consumption. I hope that this doesn&#8217;t make me seem less professional to any of you. I promise you that I take my work seriously. I just find that I communicate better this way, and my job is all about communicating.<br><br>As a fan of EverQuest this job is a wonderful opportunity for me. Not only do I get to continue my involvement with the EverQuest community (and get paid for it), I also now have the chance to affect change.<br><br>Alan VanCouvering<br>Community Relations Manager, EverQuest<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</i></UL>On behalf of the staff here at the Vault I'd like to congratulate Absor on the new job and also wish Gordon the best with his new promotion.  Good luck guys! :)
