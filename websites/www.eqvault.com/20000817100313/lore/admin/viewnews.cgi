I begin this editorial with a quote from Gordon Wrinn:<br><br>"It was a 'big event' as you suggest. Several things happened all over<br>Norrath across all the servers in the days leading up to the opening of the<br>Hole. I am sorry that you missed them."<br><br>This was in response to a player who asked about the Hole and why it was not<br>a world-effecting event.  Verant, of course, ran GM events to publicize this<br>event, but often, these quests are held in such a way that only a few<br>characters (few=30 or less) on a server.  Granted, this quest, and several<br>others - "Rending of the Veil," "Child of Hate," "Al-Kabor," "The Blooding<br>of Kithicor" - were all fantastic quests, sometimes a bit out of hand, that<br>represent the artistry and imagination contained within the Verant<br>community.  However, being that these are historical quests that have a<br>bearing on the entire community of a server, they are woefully inadequate<br>with regard to addressing a server populace as a whole.  Can this situation<br>be rectified?<br><br>Sure it can.  Is it worth the investment?  Maybe.  Most likely, as far as<br>the players at large are concerned.  We crave, as a populace, deeper<br>interaction with the world around us in EQ.  Yet, we are usually faced with<br>NPCs that mirror cardboard stand-ups at movie theaters rather than actual<br>creatures with an AI.  We need more persistent characters who can relate<br>information to us.<br><br>As far as widespread information is concerned, EQ might take a lesson from<br>Asheron's Call's town crier situation in which players can interact with a<br>series of informational NPCs through bribes and speech.  This is a minor<br>touch, but is a great way to disseminate information.  I am not thrilled<br>with these NPCs either, but Verant could easily expand on the idea and<br>develop ways for players to learn important facts (via more quests) about<br>world-changing events.<br><br>As for persistent NPCs, Verant has a massive Guide force at its disposal.<br>Granted, I see a trend wherein Verant is more and more distrustful of it's<br>Guides, but it could offer the chance to play a persistent NPC to Guides as<br>a role in addition to their Guides, much as they tried prior to most of the<br>Guide management quitting.  Perhaps anyone wishing to play a persistent<br>character could Guide for 10 hours and then spend 5-10 hours, whatever seems<br>a legitimate requirement, playing the NPC.  This would bring color,<br>continuity, and advanced interactions to the game.  As far as control, it<br>could be open to any Guide who had worked more than six months, or Verant<br>could even take a chance on players playing the roles, assigning them to<br>servers other than their own.<br><br>It's important that Verant step up this program.  "Sorry you missed it" is a<br>tired phrase for those of us who have been playing since retail and who have<br>seen maybe one, and certainly not historical, GM quest.  Let's see some<br>ingenuity coming out of Verant - the Hack and Slash is covered.<br><br>Oakgrove Fallingleaf

A lot of people get mad when they can't solo anymore. And you can always tell when they realize it won't work anymore. Depending on class and such, they say things like: "Not enough hit points anymore! Warriors got nerfed!" or "Root doesn't work it's too easy to resist!". Same goes for mana.<br><br>What people don't seem to realize is this game is specifically made for group adventure. Now I'm not saying it's impossible to solo: I managed to when I felt like it up to level 23. (By that time I just didn't want to, I have no idea whether you can or not past that.) It is just much more<br>difficult.<br><br>With a team behind/in front of you, particularly a well made one (lots of pets to avoid personal damage or healers and tanks), down time is a lot slower, without as much of a risk as getting ganged up on.<br><br>On the other hand, solo, you use your own health, own mana (if you're a<br>mage) which typically gets exhausted fighting one or two blues/greens, and<br>having another monster sneak up on you is an easy way to die. You have no<br>one watching your back!<br><br>With a quick eye, a good set of tactics, and knowledge of the zone line,<br>soloing can be very fruitful. BUT...You still may as well plan to die twice<br>as often.<br><br>The moral of this story: group up when possible, solo when absolutely<br>necessary.

Top 10 signs you've played a Dark Elf Necromancer too long:<br><br>10.  You wish you could cast "Darkness" on people passing you on the<br>freeway.<br><br>9.  When a colleague asks for your assistance, you respond with "Embrace the<br>hatred of Innoruuk and we shall discuss it,  worthless human!".<br><br>8.  You begin to have a strange appreciation for neon signs.<br><br>7.  You've been caught trying to Lifetap the neighbor's cat for extra<br>energy.<br><br>6.  You start buying all of your meat with the "bone in".<br><br>5.  There isn't a single candle in your house during storm season.<br><br>4.  You start worrying that you don't have good enough faction to enter<br>McDonald's.<br><br>3.  Whenever a policeman pulls in behind you, you seriously consider<br>"Fearing" him.<br><br>2.  You get the terms "Cemetery" and "Candy Store" confused all the time.<br><br>And the number 1 sign you've played a Dark Elf Necromancer for WAY too long<br>is:<br><br>1. You can't walk past your boss without yelling "/PET ATTACK!   /PET<br>ATTACK!"

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Eshkin, son of Drell.  I am not an educated man, although my travels of late have brought me both knowledge and clarity.  For my skills with the pen I thank my Erudite friends, Lanzera and Chiada&#8212;who have taught me the value of words well spoken.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin at the beginning.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in the hills above Surefall Glade, in the summer of 3140.  My father was Drell, the  blacksmith of Surefall.  My mother, a druid, I am told, died bringing me into this world.  My father to this day puts flowers on her grave in the Glade.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father was a hard man, but a fair one.  His rules were few, but strict.   As a boy I worked more than played.  Most of my young days were spent at the forge.   I suppose it was his way of rearing me without a woman at his side.  My earliest memory is of him hammering at the forge and seeing the angry light of the sparks leaping from the steel as he bent it to his will.  He never spoke of my mother.  I believe it must hurt him very much that she is gone.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a pain I know too well.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Druids of the Glade would, for a modest fee, teach the children of the village lessons in reading and arithmetic.  It was a fee that we never had trouble coming up with&#8212;my father was a very successful smith.  However working at the forge, I rarely had the time to attend the lessons.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a rare day in my 13th year that I first laid my hands on a bow.  My father, for the first time, left me with charge of the smithy and the house, to go and visit his sister in West Karana.   He would be gone for sixteen days.  And while I was of ample age to watch the house and minister myself to my reading and writing lessons, I was not able to run the forge.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, my father&#8217;s holiday to West Karana was a holiday for both of us.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was ecstatic.  I would leave the house for a fortnight and not look back!  I could go down to the glade and listen to the Druids teach.  I could fish in the lake with my meager cadre of friends.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walk down to Surefall Glade is not a short one, but it was good to be out of the smithy.  I tucked my wax tablet and stylus under my arm (my father never believed in wasting good coin on parchment) and headed for the Glade.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I arrived to a scene most unexpected.  The Druids of the glade were not at their guild tree, but they and many of the Jaggedpine rangers were gathered by the lake, listening enrapt to a stranger speaking on by the bridge.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a tall man, lanky of build and bare of face.  The lines of his eyes were deep and defined and his gaze set for a great distance.  He was an adventurer&#8212;the first I had seen.  He was a far-traveler, and he wore the dust of the road gladly, almost as a second skin.  As he spoke, his eyes were bright, and his smile quick.  He was speaking of gnolls.  His stories were of danger and intrigue.  Grappling in the dark with gnoll raiders for the lives of the prisoners they had taken from the villages in Karana.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His name was Tamryn Scholl and he had come to hunt the gnolls of Blackburrow, at the behest of Antonius Bayle himself.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were all fine tales, to a boy of thirteen, and tales I would glady tell again.  But it was not his tales that took me.  Leaning against the rail of the bridge, behind him, was his bow.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a thing of mesmerizing beauty.  Its graceful curves and even taper were perfectly symetrical.  It&#8217;s tips were capped in silver, and the material was something I had never seen before.  It was black, with a depth of finish that, it seemed to me, pulled in the light and consumed it.  It&#8217;s grip was polished mother-of-pearl and the silk of it&#8217;s string shone like gold.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So enrapt was I with the bow, that I did not notice that Tamryn&#8217;s stories had ended.  In fact, the only sound was a murmur of muffled laughter&#8212;at some joke I had missed.  My reverie broken, I glanced about to see everyone staring at me.   All the boys of the village and the glade&#8212;and the Druids and Rangers as well.  Tamryn&#8217;s face was lit with bemusement, and I know I flushed red to the gills.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Boy?  Are you still here?  Or did someone steal your soul?&#8221; He said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Sir?&#8221; I replied, suddenly more embarrassed.  I was never social&#8230;in fact I was quite shy.  &#8220;Uhh.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Has that trinket caught your eye?&#8221; asked Tamryn.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Uhhhh&#8230;yes, sir.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, one of the other boys, whom I knew from my studies (perhaps as the only one less present and more tardy than myself) interrupted.  &#8220;Hehe!  Eshkin never looks a girls like that!  Boys sometimes, but never girls!&#8221;  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This boy&#8217;s name was Kartum Trueshot and he was the son of a renowned hunter in far-off Kelethin.  He was here at the behest of his father to study with the Jaggepine Rangers.  He was a half-elf whose mother was the sister of Hager Sureshot&#8212;who moved and married in Kelethin.  He had generations of consummate hunters in his bloodline and he was an excellent archer&#8212;a fact that he allowed no one to forget.  As a ranger, or rather an apprentice ranger, Kartum actually lived in the Glade.  He would frequently bully the other boys&#8212;myself included.  But as I lived in the village, and seldom even attended my lessons in the Glade, I thought little of him.  That would change one day.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gnoll hunter, spoke up, &#8220;Now, boy, don&#8217;t be that way.  I&#8217;m sure...Eshkin, is it?  I&#8217;m sure he likes girls just fine&#8230;&#8221;  There was a pregnant pause where Tamryn glanced at me and then back down the to bow.  He saw something in my eyes I suppose, that caught his interest.  &#8220;Would you like to hold it, boy?&#8221;  he asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those of you unfamiliar with the customs of the woodsmen, a Ranger&#8217;s bow is a sacred item.  Often times, it is passed down, from generation to generation.  I am told that the oldest and finest of bows retain the spirits of their owners&#8230;a little at time, until they attain a life of their own.  I could tell that this was one such bow.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So could everyone else.  So could Kartum.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Uhh&#8230;&#8221;  I was not the most eloquent child.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamryn laughed and pressed the bow into my hands.  It&#8217;s surface was warm&#8230;unnaturally so.  I fancied I felt it throb in my hands.  I fancied, in a strange way&#8230;that it liked me.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bow enchanted me.  At the age of thirteen I lay alone on my bed, thinking of all the stories I had heard told, and dismissed as boasting&#8212;stories of great hunts, and magnificent battles with elusive  quarry.  Tales of tracking and exploration, told to me by others over the years, suddenly held new meaning for me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was going to be a Ranger.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my father returned from West Karana, he nodded quietly at the news of my decision.  Perhaps there was a bit of sadness in his eyes, at my not choosing to master the forge as he had.  He was supportive, however, and sponsored my apprenticeship to Hager Sureshot of Surefall Glade.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, as I suspect, the bow of Tamryn Scholl guided me to the path of the woodsman, it was not wrong in its estimation of my talent.  My newfound passion for archery, swordsmanship and the wilderness erupted.  I excelled in my training.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the years passed, I became a masterful archer, and a passable swordsman (although I still prefer the simple utility of an axe over the flash of a sword).  My I had found my place.  It was magnificent.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At age 20, I was presented with my laurels, as an initaite Ranger of the Glade.  In a gruff, rather unceremonious ceremony, I was given my guild tunic&#8230;and sumarily tossed off the bridge, into the lake, by my friends.  The fishes in that lake are not friendly, but I was able to climb out mostly intact and smiling, despite several bite marks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kartum&#8217;s laurels were presented at the same ceremony, and it was this ceremony that finally opened my eyes to a rivalry that had been brewing since the day, seven years before, when Tamryn Scholl came to Surefall Glade.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing that I noticed was the difference in the way the other rangers and initiates treated Kartum.  There was no cheering and he was not tossed to the fishes&#8212;just a few, mild supporters clapping,  and the ceremony was over.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not because of Kartum&#8217;s lineage as a half-elf.  There were many half-elves in Surefall Glade.  We were all woodsmen, or druids, and we respected each other for that.  It was just because&#8230;of Kartum.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In retrospect, I chide myself for not paying more attention to politics and such around me.  They have never interested me.  However, had I been paying attention, I would have noticed then that Kartum was held with great disdain by his peers. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a braggart and a bully, when he was younger.  But as the years passed, that evolved into something worse.  He turned to wine and womanizing, sometimes vanishing for days, whoremongering in Qeynos, when the rest of the initiates were supposed to be patrolling for gnolls and hunting the hills for game to feed the village.  Rumors were that he had spent such an extended time in Surefall Glade because his father in Kelethin did not want him back.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things took a turn for the worse in the winter of 3169.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snows had been heavy and game was scarce.  Hailstorms from the previous season had damaged much of the crops and so we had little reserves.  All the initaites were called into service to hunt for the Glade and its outlying villages.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hager Sureshot was not a man to give orders he himself would not follow, and so was also hunting.  This particular frozen day the wind pierced through our cloaks like a driven nail, and dry, stinging snow whipped our faces raw.  Our group was five strong; myself, Master Sureshot, Kartum, and two of my fellow initiates.  We had hunted far, tracking a herd of elk over several ranges of the Qeynos Hills.  At length, with the cold aching through our gloves and boots, we descended through hip-deep snow into a sheltered valley.  Our focus had been entirely on the quarry, and the cold and exertion had worn us down.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one suspected exacly how close we were to Blackburrow.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master sureshot was in the lead, pressing through the snow after the now clear tracks of our game.  The arrows came out of nowhere&#8230;hissing hatefully through the air like angry insects.  We were taken totally by surprise.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first volley dropped one of my fellows in his tracks, and Master Sureshot took a shaft through the leg.  I felt the air sing as the feathers of one grazed by my face.  Cries went up and our small party lurched into action.  Master Sureshot staggered back to his feet on his wounded leg and hobbled to the shelter of  large group of overhanging rocks.  Kartum and the other initiate were close on his heels, as I labored to drag the inert body of our fallen comrade through the snow to the shelter of the rocks.  It took me only a few seconds watching his blood pour into the snow to realize that he was dead.  Persued by another volley of arrows, I stumbled through the snow to the others.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time I arrived, Master Sureshot was groggy with loss of blood.  The bladed arrowhead had severed an artery in his leg and the ground around the rock was slippery with blood.  For a moment, I stood in shock, in disbelief that a man could bleed so much.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The howling war-cries of the gnolls on the hill above us woke me from my shock.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Kartum, your belt!&#8221; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kartum was pressed against the rock, his eyes wide with fear.  His bow had dropped useless to the ground. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Kartum!  Pick up your bow and give me your belt!  I need to bind Master Sureshot&#8217;s wounds!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other initiate, a young half-elf named Cheskin, cursed, snatching Kartum&#8217;s bow up off the ground and pressing it into the shivering woodsman&#8217;s hands.  He then whipped off his belt and helped me to bind Master Sureshot&#8217;s leg.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Master  had lost much blood.  My hands, tightening the tourniquet were shaking with fear, but Master Sureshot opened his eyes and looked into mine.  It was not the gaze of a dying man I saw there, but the resolve of a hunter.  His eyes were unafraid.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I thought to myself, We will not die here.  Not here.  Not today.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheskin and I quickly wrapped him in our cloaks, shivering form the cold and the fearful howling of the gnolls.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had all but forgotten about Kartum.  He was huddled in a ball beneath the rock.  The fear had taken his mind.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheskin looked at me and nocked an arrow to his string,  &#8220;How many are there, do you think?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shook my head, &#8220;I saw no tracks, but the arrows&#8230;three, perhaps four.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheskin put his back to the rock and tried to crane his neck around to have a look up the hill.  An arrow sparked off the stone next to his face and he jumped back.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He blew out a breath, &#8220;Have you ever fought a gnoll before?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;No&#8230;I have not.&#8221;  I laughed, the situation was suddenly funny to me.  &#8220;In fact, I have never drawn blade, nor bow in anger against&#8230;.anything.  Have you?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheskin loosened his sword in the scabbard, &#8220;I once got punched in the face by the bouncer at Fish&#8217;s.  He is large and hairy, but that is as close as I have come.  What should we do?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought for a moment, surveying the slope of the hill.  &#8220;We can&#8217;t wait.  Even if we could out-shoot them, they would go and get their friends if the fight went agianst them.  Runing is out.  Master Sureshot will die if we leave him.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Then we fight.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Aye&#8230;&#8221;  I was thinking fast.  They could take us simply by coming down both sides of the rock at the same time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The howling continued, growing closer, and all about me I fancied I heard the snapping of twigs.  We had to act fast.  &#8220;Give me your quiver.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Aye.&#8221;  Cheskin handed the quiver over.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned to Kartum, huddled against the rock, &#8220;Kartum, snap out of it, we need you!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response, he rocked slighly back and forth fetally on his hanuches and shivered, looking up at me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dropping to one knee I grabbed him by the tunic and shook him,&#8220;Dammit, Kartum we need you! You are the best shot among us now!  We need your skill!  If we are to live, we need your skill <b>now</b>!  Cheskin is going to run, and draw their fire&#8230;&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Err&#8230;I am?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;&#8230;while you shoot them.  I will protect your back when they come for you.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was true.  I was the strongest in close combat, being much bigger than either of them.  Kartum was the best shot, and Cheskin was the fleetest of foot.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow, Kartum composed himself, wiped the tears from his eyes and gripped his bow.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I handed Cheskin&#8217;s quiver to Kartum.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheskin unsheathed his blade and glared at Kartum.  &#8220;Shoot straight, please.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I leaned my bow and qiver against the rock and bared my sword. &#8220;Go Ches!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8230;And he was off.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrows began to whistle through the air and the howling echoing through the ice-locked woods increased its frenzy.  Cheskin zigzagged back and forth between the trees, as shafts buried themselves in the trees and raised dusty puffs of snow where they hit the ground.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kartum rose to the challenge and stepped out form around the rock.  In a single, fluid movement he drew back, fired, and snatched another shaft from his quiver.  I heard the piercing squeal of the gnoll as the arrow struck it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expecting what came next, I weighed my sword in my hand and turned my back to Kartum.  Ches had drawn at least some of them out of their cover and I would have to rely on Kartum&#8217;s prowess with the bow to deal with them.  But the others&#8230;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, it was before me, skidding around the rock on the slick snow.  My impresion to this day, though I have since seen much more fearsome monsters, was that it was the biggest thing I had ever seen.  It was fully a foot taller than me and hugely muscled.  In it&#8217;s hand was a rusty mace, still caked with the black blood and hair of previous victims.  The stench of its fur filed my nostrils as the mace whistled down at my head.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sword swept up and around in an arc and the shock of the blow ran down my arm as steel screamed against steel.  It was enough&#8212;instead of caving in my skull, the monster&#8217;s mace grazed harmlessly down my shoulder.  I slashed with all my strengh across its snarling mouth.  The sound of my blade crashing through its teeth and the feel of it slashing through the soft flesh of its mouth twisted in my gut.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a second, the gnoll was blind with pain.  It stumbled back, its strange legs peddling against the slippery ground.  Pain exploded in my side as the wild swing of his mace pounded into my ribs.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the pain, I drove forward, spearing with the point of my sword.  In an instant&#8217;s decision, the gnoll&#8217;s mace thudded to the ground and its paws flailed before it, trying to stop the point of my blade, but too late.  I felt the steel pass effortlesly through fur and flesh of it&#8217;s neck before grinding to a halt against the bone.  As I had been taught, I turned my body, twisting and raising my arm as I yanked the blade back.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot blood erupted from its open throat and its grasped feebly to try and contain the geysering flow.   As it sank to the ground and leaned against me, I looked into its yellow eyes.  Strangely peaceful, it gazed back.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its paw slid down my arm to my limp hand and gripped it strongly, as might a friend.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was my first taste of war.  Inexplicably, I was overcome with a wash of pure sorrow, and for just a moment, I held its hand as it died.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kartum&#8217;s bowstring sang again through the strange and sudden quiet in my mind, and vaugely, I heard his voice calling to me.  I gently lowered the body of my enemy to the snow, feeling the warmth of his blood seeping through my tunic.  It is difficult for me to remember, but I believe I was crying.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Eshkin!&#8221; Kartum called over his shoulder,  &#8220;I have killed two of them!  I see no others!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was only vaguely aware of  his words.  As I looked up, a tall and imposing gnoll stood before me, its yellow eyes gazing evenly down.  He was not black of fur and clad in rags, like the one I knelt beside.  Instead his fur was a light gray, touched with brown.  In its hand, it held a staff of red wood inlaid with runes of silver, and it was clothed in clean, ornate robes of red and black.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hand gripped the haft of my sword and I slowly rose from my knees.  This could only be some kind of gnoll holy man.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long moment, the shaman stared at me, and at the body of its fallen comrade (or more likely, servant).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it suddenly&#8212;silently&#8212;it was gone&#8230;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kartum&#8217;s hand on my shoulder startled me out of my skin.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;We got them!  We kiled them all!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shook my head slowly to clear it, &#8220;..Not all&#8230;&#8221;  I mumbled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Sureshot had recovered a bit during the fight, he was groggy and in pain, but he was awake.  Cheskin&#8217;s voice echoed through the woods from a distance, &#8220;They aren&#8217;t shooting at me anymore!  Did we win?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I managed a laugh, looking down at my clothes.  I was bathed in blood.  Fortunately, other than the dull pain in my side where the mace had hit, I was uninjured.  None of it was mine.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened next lives still as the most revolting display I have seen by a man.  Kartum grabbed the body of the fallen gnoll and flipped it roughtly over onto its back.   &#8220;Thought you could best ME, did you!?&#8221; he laughed, &#8220;Filthy thing!&#8221;  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kartum unclasped his breeches and moved to urinate on the body of the gnoll.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The force of my shove sent him sprawling in the snow.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He struggled to rise, holding his pants up with one hand.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;No.&#8221; I said simply, &#8220;You&#8217;ll not do that.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he rose, his hand fell to the pomel of his knife.  There was rage in his eyes and his face was flushed red.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Sureshot&#8217;s weak voice broke the tension.  &#8220;Boys, we must go.  We will send a crew back to collect the bodies...of ours, and theirs.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had  I the time, I would have thought much of that battle, and of the strange gnoll shaman.  In the days that followed, however the glade was abuzz with the news of our battle.  The druids of the Glade cared for our Master, and through their healing, both magical and herbal, he was on his feet again in no time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kartum again disappeared to Qeynos, which was just as well.  Cheskin&#8217;s account of the battle was not kind to him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had nothing much to say about the incident, save that I was glad we got out of it.  I never spoke of the shaman.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days afterward, Kartum, Cheskin and myself were called to the Glade to attend a memorial for our fallen comrade.  The entire Glade was there, both the Rangers and the Durids, as well as many of the villagers of the outlying areas.   It had been so long since we&#8217;d had a funeral in the Glade that I had forgotten how many people might be around.  The place was simply thronging.  The high druid gave a short, but well-spoken speech and spread our comrade&#8217;s ashes over the water.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterward, Hagar Sureshot stepped up onto the bridge and motioned for silence.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, for those of you unfamiliar with ranger ceremonies, let me state that if you were not familiar with them, you might  simply walk by one  without noticing&#8212;so informal and brief are they.  For Hager Sureshot, this was a pageant&#8230;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Ahem&#8230;&#8221;  he shuffled a bit on his sore leg, &#8220;In the wake of our bidding farewell to one of our own, I would like to take a minute to honor those who saved my life.  Cheskin, Eshkin and my nephew, Kartum.  Please come up here.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was whispering and some quiet clapping as the three of us stepped up onto the bridge.  He bowed before each of us in turn, gripping our arms warmly.  Everyone in the Glade began to clap...filling the air  with clamor. I was embarassed, and I know I was blushing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a wave of his hand, he once again quieted the glade.  &#8220;Please, quiet&#8230;Also, I&#8217;d like to take a bit more of your time to commend one of our initaites for his exceptional valor, and honor, in battle.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Sureshot motioned to the crowd and a druid stepped forth holding a long, narrow box of polished oak.  He took the box and turned to me, opening it toward me, so that I could see its contents.  I glanced back and forth, wondering what he was doing&#8230;or rather, who he was looking at.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Eshkin kept his head in the crisis.  He pulled the party together and hatched the plan that saved us.  He fought with courage and honor--both to his friends and his enemies.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next to me, I heard Kartum slowly exhaling a hissing breath of suppressed malice through his teeth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;&#8230;Eshkin, I would like to present you with this arrow.  Carry it with you always, and it will never fail you.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If  I was thinking about Kartum and his jealous reaction at that moment, it was quickly dispelled at the sight of the arrow.  Its head of forged of steel blades and its vanes were of bone.   The shaft was of darkwood; that same material of the magic bow, I had seen so many years ago.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Uh&#8230;Master,&#8221; I said, &#8220;This really not necessary.  I only did what I could&#8230;&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Nonsense, Eshkin&#8230;&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;No, really sir, anyone would have&#8230;&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;ESHKIN!&#8221; he yelled suddenly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Uh&#8230;yes, sir?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Shut up.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Aye.  Yes, sir.&#8221; I took the arrow and placed it in my quiver.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air of the glade was filed with wild clapping and cheering.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the proudest moment in my life&#8230;back from a day when I could feel pride..<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My trade as a hunter was, from that day, touched with a blessing from Tunare.  My skills solidified and no quarry seemed able to elude me.  When I went into the hills to hunt, I suddenly found myself in need of other intitiates to help me carry the game back to the Glade.  My pelts wre always of the best quality and brought good prices form the merchants of Qeynos.  Even the gnolls of Blackburrow seemed to vanish from sight for a time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father was getting old now, and expressed a desire to leave off the smithing business.  One day, in the sumertime, he called me back to the smithy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Eshkin, I will be straight with you, you have made a good name for yourself as a hunter.  I think that by the next harvests, Hager Sureshot will declare you a Ranger.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I poured my father another mug of coffee and seated myself at the table.  &#8220;Thank you, father.  That is my hope.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;You have done well, and I have raised you right.  I raised you to never lie.  So you must tell me something now, in perfect truth.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Of course, father.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Do you have any desire to keep up the smithy, after I am gone?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was nothing like the question I had been expecting.  I am not certain what I was expecting, but that was not it.  &#8220;Father?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Do you wish to smith here in the village, or hunt with the Jaggedpine Treefolk?&#8217;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not a hard decision, &#8220;I hope I do not offend, father, but I am a hunter now.  I wish to continue with that.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not surprised, &#8220;Very well.  I ask it because I am quitting.  I will travel next spring to the Karanas to live with my sister&#8230;permanently.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I paused for a moment.  He was trying to tell me something, but I was not sure what.  &#8220;What of the smithy, father?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;It is yours, son.  Take it.  Do with it what you wish.  If you do not wish to smith, you can get a very handsome offer on it from the merchants in Qeynos.  It will be good money for you.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;But what about you?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed.  It was a rare and welcome laugh; one I had not heard in a long time.  &#8220;I will be fine, son.  You don&#8217;t think I have been smithing all these years without squirrling some plat away, do you?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that was that.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father left in the spring for the Karanas and the smithy was empty.  He left with me the rolled parchement of title that declared the smithy mine.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was at the harvest festival, in the Glade that spring, that I met my wife.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tables had been set out in the Glade and the kegs sunk in the lake to cool.  The ovens had smoked all night for a week before and the tables were heavy with meat and fish and bread.  There were wines from Qeynos and grapes, imported all the way from Karana.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bards and merchants had come from the city to sing and sell their wares.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole glade was alive with celebration, and free of care.  Kartum was not present.  In the eighteen months since our fight with the gnolls, he had become an incorragble drunk, only showing his face in the Glade when he needed a party to hunt with---so that he might get pelts to sell for more liquor.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was standing with Cheskin, taking a moment of indulgance with a cup of mead.  He was knelt down on one knee, playing at magic tricks with his little daughter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Esh, you really should spend more time in the Glade.  You are hunting all the time.  Or come with me and Tuvar to Qeynos for a few days.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Why would I want to do that, Ches?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Because it&#8217;s social, ya big fool!  Because it&#8217;s fun!  My wife can watch the babes for a few days, as long as I care for the house before I go.  We can see the sights!  I hear there is a place in Qeynos that sells gnoll beer.  You seem to have a fascination with the brutes.  Wouldn&#8217;t you like to try their beer?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I don&#8217;t like beer, Ches.  Besides, isn&#8217;t gnoll beer against the law?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Bah,&#8221; he said, &#8220;The laws of Antonius Bayle.  What harm is there in a little gnoll beer?   I have heard it&#8217;s quite good.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I don&#8217;t like beer, Ches.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;But it&#8217;s <b>gnoll</b> beer, Esh.  It&#8217;s an oddity.  It&#8217;s an experience.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Hmm.  But if I don&#8217;t like beer, wouldn&#8217;t it be a <b>bad</b> experience?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheskin shook his head, &#8220;You are impossible.  What about the girls, then?  There are dancing shows&#8230;and I hear the ladies are like wild animals.  A new quarry for your hunting, eh?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I laughed, &#8220;You would have me chasing dancing girls in Qeynos?  You have me mistaken for Kartum.  The girl for me won&#8217;t be found&#8230;in&#8230;a&#8230;.tavern&#8230;&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Where, then Eshkin of the black arrow?  You spend far too much time in the company of men.  What girl could take your mind off the hunt?  Esh?  Esh?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could barely hear him.  Amid a group of people gathered around a young bard, was a young woman.  Her dress was simple brown cotton and there were flowers in her auburn hair.  She wore no shoes on her feet and about her waist was a simple belt hung with medicine pouches.  She was a Druid, surely, but none I had seen in the Glade.  I would have remembered.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was swaying back and forth to the ballad of the bard and clapping her hands softly.  The smile on her face was luminous and her eyes shone with mirth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Uhh&#8230;.hello.&#8221;  I was instantly embarassed.  Was that the best I could do?  Faced with the vision of her before me, I  suppose I should be happy that I could speak at all.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned and looked at me, and her smile broadened, &#8220;Hail&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok Eshkin, what now?  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Are you from here?&#8221; I asked.  &#8216;IwasonlywonderingbecausehavelivedherealongtimeandIdon&#8217;t remembereverseeingyouhere.Youlooktobeadruid,butIthoughtIknewalltheDruidsoftheGlade&#8230;umm&#8230;&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She laughed and took my hand.  The touch of her soft fingers sent a warm shiver through my entire body.  &#8220;Dance with me,&#8221; she said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We danced.   I barely remember it, and for that I am grateful, because I have always been a terrible dancer.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was it for me.  It was instant and undeniable.  For the rest of the festival we were never apart.  After I composed myself, I was able to speak again and we talked long into the night.  Her name was Layla and she was a Druid of Surefall, an initiate, sent from Qeynos by her family.  Once again I hadn&#8217;t been paying attention&#8212;I should have noticed her the moment she arrived.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got little hunting done that summer, and Cheskin complained that he saw even less of me.  However, I didn&#8217;t care.  I had Layla.  She could tell a tale like a bard and the music of her laughter was beter than the finest lute&#8230;.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will stop this here and move on&#8230;.I do not feel that I can write more on her just now&#8230;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were married in the Glade, by the fall and Cheskin was my best man.  At the druid guild tree, the druids placed wreaths of flowers on our heads and declared their blessings.  I have never had a happier moment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druids and Rangers are people of the land, but when the land is harsh, everyone loves a house.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided that, in short order I would build Layla a house.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title to the smithy was still safely stowed in Qeynos Hold and it did not take long for me to secure a buyer for the place.  A fully outfitted smithy is an expensive affair, and buyers would be rare.  However, my terms were simple and eagerly accepted.  I sealed the deal, with Cheskin at my side, over a Blackburow Stout, in Fish&#8217;s Tavern by the docks in Qeynos.  Ches was delighted that  had finally tried his gnoll beer.  He was right.  It was good.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchant would not take delivery of the smithy or open busines there until I sent word that the house was completed.  Additionally, he would help me find woodcutters and craftsmen to help me build it.  It would be built in total secrecy, as a surprise for her.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheskin was my accomplice in this, claiming to Layla and the rangers of the glade that I had accompanied him on his hunting&#8212;to cover my absence from the hunt.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Layla was a Druid, I decided that the house would be very close to the Glade, perched atop the steep rocky ridge down from the waterfall.  From inside Surefall Glade, it was invisible, the crest of its roof just hidden by the towering rock walls that protectet the home of the Jaggedpine Treefolk.  It could be accessed by a narrow path around the back side of the mountain.  It would be built of treated logs, and I made sure that all the joints were well chinked with daub.  The crowning finish of the place was a window of polished glass panes, imported from Erudin.   This was so that we could sit and look out over the Glade in the winter.  There were two fireplaces for warmth and a clay cistern on the roof  to catch rainwater and snowmelt.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was magnificent.  All false modesty aside, I had outdone myself.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheskin helped me with the work when he could as did the craftsmen sent by the merchant.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had I taken time to stop and reflect, I should have considered myself fortunate to have the hidden wealth to bring such a project to life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All through  the months of building the house, Layla was distraught at my long abscences.  She complained that she wanted to see me more and missed our long talks.  In response I told her that I was hunting hard and saving my pelts to sell&#8212;so that I might surpirse her with something.  Despite her questions I kept my secret safe, and before autumn, the house was complete.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood in the main room and lit my pipe (tobbacco was a habit that the decadent Cheskin had addicted me to). Watching how the late autumn daylight played over edges the amazing glass window.  How the High Men must treasure the secret of changing sand into glass.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened, at last and Cheskin and his wife Maurita carefuly escorted Layla into the room.  She was blindfolded, but smiling.  &#8220;You two had best not keep me much longer in suspense.  My master is teaching me to summon a stinging swarm of pests to put you in your place&#8230;&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;No more suspense, my darling,&#8221; I said, removing the blindfold from her eyes.  That look of wonder on her face is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen&#8230;before&#8230;or since.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We made love that night in our new home.  Perfect, passionate&#8230;love without doubt.  Life was going to be perfect&#8230;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Layla and I had lived in the house for almost four months.  As soon as the secret was out, we were the subject of much gossip in the Glade.  Questions as to where I had gotten the money for such an endeavor were quickly laid to rest by Cheskin, whose wagging tongue could rival any bard.  Everyone paid a visit&#8230;espically to see the wonderful Erudite glass window.  Well&#8230;almost everyone.  Kartum never came.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black arrow that Hager Sureshot had given me that day had treated me well.  While most other arrows splintered and shatterd in the prey, the black arrow never did.  Part of its enchantment, I suppose.  With it, I had dropped grizzly bears in their tracks in a single shot.  Throughout its service it had not so much as scratched or tarnished.  Its shaft was still straight and true and its path never erred.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bottom of the hill I shook hands with my hunting party and bid them good evening, looking forward to a quiet night by the fire with Layla curled up against me in our favorite chair, reading to me from one of her many books.  I was always literate, but only just so.  Layla had made it her personal task to make me, not only the top gamesman in the Glade, but also the most alacrit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The path to the house was slick with snow that day, but the warming weather was sure to melt it away.  I was thinking as I rounded the corner of the house that I should save some more money and build a wooden walkway in its place.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My smile broadened as I stepped up onto the threshhold and opened the door.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Layla darling, I&#8217;m&#8230;back&#8230;.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house was not as it should be.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furniture was overturned, and papers and books&#8212;her precious papers and books&#8212;were strewn wildly about the floor.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hand fell to the hilt of my sword, and the pelts I had ben carrying in my arms fell to the floor.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Layla hung by her wrists, tied to a crossbeam in the ceiling.  Her dress was in tatters and she was covered in blood from the long, deep razor cuts on her arms&#8230;..and her face.  There was a gag in her mouth&#8230;or&#8230;rather&#8230;what was left of her mouth&#8212;to silence her screams.  The flesh of her hands was black where the ropes bound her.  She must have been hanging there all day.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her, swollen, beaten eyes opened slightly, and the light of recognition lit in them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It felt as though the soul had been drained out of me&#8230;all the world was cold and frost.  The bile rose in my throat, and the tears rose in my eyes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A feeling of utter helplessless like I have never felt&#8230;and will never feel again, swept over me.  However long she had been here&#8230;like this&#8230;I had not known&#8230;and could not help. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instanly I was torn between two overpowering urges.  First to get her down from there.  And second&#8212;to destroy whatever monster (for it could be no man) that had done this thing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only piece of furniture left standing in the room was our chair.  The same chair the only a moment before I had imagined Layla and I nested in for the night.  It was a wide, high-backed chair, that we normally kept in front of the glass window.  Now, however, it was facing away from the door&#8212;pulled into the center of the room as a single seat for a madman&#8217;s private show.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure in the chair rose and tunred to face me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Hager Sureshot.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at me for a moment, or perhaps it was a month.  There were spatters of blood on his face and scratch marks over his eyes that must have been made by Layla, in her desperate defense.  In one hand, he held a cup of mead from our kitchen.  In the other, my shaving razor&#8230;covered in Layla&#8217;s blood.  He cocked his head sideways in a curious gaze, and a slight smile touched his mouth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he spoke, his voice was not the gruff, terse tone of Hager Sureshot, but the delicate musical sound of my Layla.  He&#8230;or it&#8230;said my name.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Eshkin&#8230;my love&#8230;where are you?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sword whistled from its scabbard in a blur and my entire being erupted in invincible rage.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had I known the name if Innoruk then, I would have forsaken Surefall, forsaken Tunare, and called on the Prince of Hate, for the power to crush this thing bare-handed&#8212;to dine on its screams and lavish in the feeling of tearing the flesh from its bones.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shock of my own blow ran up my arm as the blade choped into the flesh of  its neck.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it smiled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blow that impacted against the side of my head was mericful.  Blood exploded in my sinuses and warm, white light flashed before my eyes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#8217;t remember much of the fight&#8212;save that it was hopless.  My last recollection of it was that Sureshot&#8217;s arms had changed&#8212;growing into disproportionate claws&#8230;.like the blades of a scythe.    They scissored in on my forearms, cutting deep holding me helpless off the floor, like a bloody marionette.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#8217;s held me up to her; to the tortured, mutilated face of my love.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, it spoke in her vioce, &#8220;Eshkin&#8230;kiss me, my love&#8230;we can&#8217;t be late for dinner&#8230;&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I screamed then, I think&#8230;and it laughed.  Hager&#8217;s body, Layla&#8217;s voice&#8230;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through my tears  I wished for death.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Hmmm&#8230;delicious&#8230;&#8221; it said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as a child might skip a stone over the water, it cast me out the window.  The strength of its throw, as it propelled me, was unearthly.   I remember the shattering of  Erudite glass, and the cuts it dealt me, only vaguely.  I remember the fall, and the feeling of weightlesness, and a dream of pain, of blood erupting up into my mouth&#8230;and of bones splintering like glass.  Was it an hour, or only a moment, I do not recall&#8212;but my blood-blind eyes opened to find me on the roof of the Rangers&#8217; cabin in the Glade. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My body had made a dent in the roof.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broken ribs, legs, fingers&#8230;everything was a dull  haze of pain.  Everything was growing cold&#8230;and my body began to shake.  Death would come soon&#8230;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the roof of the cabin I could see the very top gables of my house above&#8230;.and the creature.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had cast off all pretense, and was now not even vaguely human.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had climbed  to the roof, with my Layla cradled in its claws.  It must have unbound her mouth, because I could hear her screams&#8230;and I remembered it&#8217;s word&#8230;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delicious.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agony&#8230;fear&#8230;sorrow.  It loved these things.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Layla was terribly fearful of heights&#8230;and so it would finish her&#8230;by casting her down into the glade.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though my legs did not work, somehow my arms did.  I managed to roll onto my side and pull my bow from it&#8217;s quiver.  My bloodied hand shakily felt for the one thing I needed&#8230;a last hope.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black arrow.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laying in anguish I fitted it to the nock and drew with all my strength.  I could hear the fiber of the bow splintering from within, from the force, as I drew.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One shot&#8230;one hope&#8230;with the black arrow that had never failed me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I missed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I closed my eyes and relaxed into death as I heard my love&#8217;s screams silenced against the stone.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be with her soon.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Layla&#8230;I come.<br>****************************************************************************<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I woke in the Druid tree, in the Glade.  Their herbs had taken the pain away, and their healing had restored my legs.  I had slept the sleep of death for a fortnight.   It had taken the high druid himself three days of meditiation and casting to save my legs&#8230;but they did it.  Had the incident happened farther from such a powerful healer, I&#8217;d not have my legs now&#8230;had I lived at all.  For their aid, I will always be grateful.  Somehow, I was whole&#8212;save for the eerie scars the creature had left on my forearms from where it grabbed me. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creature&#8230;whatever it was, had been thorough.  It had not forgotten to light the house as it left.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My life was over.  My Layla, and the beautiful home I had built for her&#8230;now all just a pile of ashes.  Now, in the place of her laughter there is only a cold, empty space&#8212;a cold vacum without joy or light.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as I was able, I left the care of the druids and climbed the ridge on shaky legs to see the ruin that was once my life.  The black soot and charred hulks of the logs were thick on the ground.  One could vaguely tell that it was once a house.  Only because the stone chimneys still stood&#8212;cracked from the furnace heat and blackened with the smoke from the blaze.  Too numb to feel anything as I surveyed the destruction, my foot chanced to turn up the soot, with an odd tinkling sound.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Squatting in the coals I gently lifted the ruined frame of the Erudite glass window from the ash.  I slowly shook my head, as I looked at it.  Such a wondrous thing of beauty it had been.  Months to create&#8230;and seconds to destroy. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sliver glint in the ash I had uncovered by moving the window caught my eye.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrow.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dusted it off and looked at it.  Still perfect.  It had missed its mark, but survived the fire.  For a moment I fancied breaking it in my hands, but reason restrained me.  To destroy it would do no good.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would keep it&#8230;for another day.<br>**********************************************************************************<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Druids presented me with Layla&#8217;s ashes for the burial shortly after my recovery.  Again, all the Jaggedpine Treefolk gathered in the Glade.  It was a short, but elegant ceremony, performed by the High druid.  The druid did all the speaking.  I could not.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had never heard of such a creature as the one that lived in my dreams now, but I related the details to Master Sureshot as best I could.  He gave my his condolences and told me he would inquire about what manner of beast this might be.  Other than that, he was supportive.  I could live in the bunkhouse with the other intiaites and eat in the cabin.  He told me there would be no need to hunt, until I felt up to it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was then that Kartum resurfaced.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back on my experiences with Kartum, I can still not understand why he harbored such ill will for me.  Simple jealousy does not explain it all.  It seemed that, whatever troubled him so badly that he needed always hide in the bottle, he had blamed on me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheskin and I were in the cabin for the evening meal.  Tunare bless Cheskin for his staunch support in these times.  He and Maurita always had a place for me at their table.  Some nights though, Ches and I went down to the Glade and ate at the cabin.  He was always at my side.  This was one such night.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kartum&#8217;s stride was straight, but his face was flushed with wine when he entered the dining hall.  He filled his plate and seated himself across from me, glancing to his left and right and mumbling unheard greeting to the initiates beside him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only moments before he started on me.  His anger and courage must have been fueled by the wine.  When he spoke his voice was deliberately loud&#8212;to be certain that everyone at the table could hear.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I have heard that Eshkin has had a tragedy!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at him evenly, my heart growing numb as the subject was braoched that I least wanted to hear about.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was he trying to do here?   I nodded and forced myself to speak, &#8220;Aye, Kartum.  That&#8217;s true.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I have heard that a monster attacked in the night&#8230;killed Layla and burned down his beautiful house!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shook my head and again forced the words to come, &#8220;This is not new news, Kartum.  What is your point?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was here that Cheskin stepped in, rising from the table, &#8220;Kartum, you had best excuse yourself.  You are drunk.&#8217;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;The hell I am!  I can hold my liquor with the best.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Then what is your purose here?&#8221; asked Cheskin, &#8220;Just opening wounds?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kartum took a bite from his plate and laughed, &#8220;Not at all.  I just think it&#8217;s unusual that Fortune should suddenly fail <b>poor</b> Eshkin&#8212;who seemed so favored by her before.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I carefully set down my sliverware and placed my hands on the table, &#8220;Explain that.&#8221;  I stated.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Well,&#8221; Kartum smiled and leaned back in his chair.  He had the attention of the whole room now.  &#8220;A monster&#8230;that killed your woman and <b>then</b> lit your house afire?  Sounds a bit supect to me.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weight of Ches&#8217; hand on my shoulder made me suddenly aware that I was standing.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ches squeezed my shoulder, &#8220;Kartum, you are a fool.  You have been drinking and you are not welcome here.  I don&#8217;t care whose nephew you are, such talk is sheer spite.  We&#8217;ll have none of it here.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Kartum was on a roll.  He knew he was getting to me.  Such blatant flaunting of Layla&#8217;s memory&#8212;to use her to try and hurt me&#8212;he could not have picked a better subject.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;m merely supposing, Cheskin,  that Eshkin had to get the money to build his house from somewhere.  Perhaps someone wanted it back?  Despite her bad taste in men, I&#8217;m certain Layla wasn&#8217;t earning her keep on the streets of Qeynos&#8230;at least I&#8217;m fairly certain&#8230;&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My cup of water was in motion faster than I could stop my arm.  Its contents splashed into Kartum&#8217;s eyes, blinding him for a moment.  In that moment, my fingers laced themselves into his hair and pounded his face into the hard oak of the table.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound was uncertain and the room was a haze.  I am unclear of the reactions of those around me.  All I knew was my rage to exterminate Kartum was not to be denied.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no hesitation, as my arms carried out actions, seemingly on their own.  Perhaps the creature had left the touch of Innoruk upon me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always been a big man.  My time at the forge as a boy had conditioned me with the build of a smith from a young age.  Kartum was off-balance, bent over the table, unable to get the leverage to pull himself away as I pressed his face into the plate of food before me.  With one hand in his hair, I held the half-elf&#8217;s face to the table, and he flailed and gasped for air through the mess of food on my plate.  With the other,  I slid my table knife under his neck and sawed open his throat.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood erupted all over the table, the flood of it carrying away bits of bread and meat as it spread across the wood.  Kartum&#8217;s gargling cry was choked off by the blood and food.  I held his face to the table until his struggles ceased&#8230;and his body relaxed into death.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my rage faded, I became aware of the thick silence that had fallen over the dining hall.  Some two dozen of the Jaggedpine Rangers stood staring at the grizzly spectacle before them.  There was no time to run for the druids&#8212;Kartum was obviously quite dead.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oddly enough, I felt no remorse, as I had on the day I had battled with the gnoll.  The gnoll was, somehow&#8230;well&#8230;somehow the gnoll was just another soldier, innocent at heart, but fighting the fight he was born to fight.  Kartum was an animal.  I felt no more remorse than had I just gutted a kill.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Letting the bloody knife clatter to the tabletop, I straightened and wiped the blood from my hands with my napkin.  A strange numbness had settled on me.   &#8220;I guess I had better go tell Master Sureshot about this.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one spoke as I walked from the room.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was said behind closed doors, I do not know, but it went on for several days.  I was disarmed and escorted to the bear caves, where I was ordered to stay.  Two of my comrades guarded the entrance to ensure I did not escape.  It was a token, really.  Everyone knew I would not try to leave Surefall Glade before judgement had been passed on my deed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not wonder about my fate.  I had ceased to care.  My life had ended a fortnight ago.  It was only now that I would get around to dying.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#8217;t know what was said between Hager Sureshot and the High Druid, but it was apparently not what I was expecting.  The next night, from the entrance to my impromptu prison, I heard whispered voices, and the tread of boots.  Into the meager light of my lantern, where I had expected the armored forms of Antonius Bayle&#8217;s guards, stepped Hager Sureshot.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His skin was pale and there were dark circles under his eyes.  Sleep must have eluded him for some time.  &#8220;Eshkin,&#8221; he said, nodding to me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Master Sureshot.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I have been in long deliberation with the druids and others of the Jaggedpine Rangers.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Yes, sir. I imagined that you would be.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;&#8230;and so  am quite tired of talk right now, so I will come to the point.  The business of the Jaggedpine Treefolk is not the business of Qeynos, or Antonuis Bayle.  We have made our own decisions.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Rangers do not kill rangers.  You must leave Surefall Glade.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Sir?&#8221;  It was not that I did not understand him.  I found the verdict surprising.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Kartum was a disgrace to our kind.  It was inevitable that he one day would meet such an end.  But rangers do not kill rangers.  Do you understand me?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I nodded.  The numbness in my mind and heart was all there was.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Very well.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;This thing shall not be spoken of in Surefall.  Take your things and go.  It makes no difference where.  Just go to your bunk and get your things.  Speak to no one.  Then leave.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Aye.  I will sir.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a long pause.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Eshkin.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Yes sir?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Now, please.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Oh&#8230;.yes sir.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood, taking the lantern in my hand, and walked toward the exit to the cave.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sureshot&#8217;s voice stopped me at the entrance, &#8220;Eshkin, one more thing.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned to look at him, &#8220;Sir?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice was low and he looked intently into my eyes as he spoke.  &#8220;I know do not want to think about&#8230;that night&#8230;or about the creature that took my form.  But I have spoken with the druids on it, and this thing has touched you.  It has marked you.  As you travel&#8230;as you go&#8230;it might be good of you to think on it.  One day you may find it important.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I nodded to him.  Not understanding what he was saying.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not want to understand.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night I looked bitterly back at the torchlit tunnel that was the entrance to Surefall Glade.  I had lived there all my life.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that was over now.  That life was just a bright and painful memory.  It was time for a new life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, I lived in the remote parts of Qeynos hills,  hunting and foraging for my meals and camping against the cold.  The quiet  of the wilderness demanded nothing of my mind.  I could try to forget.  I could live as an animal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This I did for two years.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, during this time, I was not without certain needs.  Clothing wears out, bowstrings break, and arrow points were always a commodity.  For this reason I had to endure the presence of people from time to time and sell my pelts in Qeynos for money to purchase that which I needed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pallor of my mind and the heaviness of my heart must have been fading at last.  On one of these excursions I found myself, on a lark, at Fish&#8217;s Tavern.  After almost two years, Fish Ranamer still recognized me.  We exchanged michevious grins, as he quietly changed my coin for a case of Blackburrow Stout.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stout was a treat for me.  Having finally packed the heavy crate back to my camp in the hills, I nursed the beers, on special occasions:  Layla&#8217;s birthday, my own birthday, and sometimes when Tunare favored me with a quick and easy hunt<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had bought twenty four beers from Fish Ranamer, each of the odd, brown clay bottles sealed in wax.  After each beer I would carefully rinse the bottle and use it later to hold water.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several months later, I was down to eight of them.  I had not been gone from camp long when a yearling buck crossed my path.  With the day&#8217;s hunting done early, I decided to enjoy the last of the autumn warmth and simply lay by the stream with a beer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first I could not decide what was wrong when I opened the wooden case in my tent.  I glanced about, listening and smelling the air.  Someone had been in my tent.  The crate was not latched, as it should have been.  While I was out, someone had been in my camp.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carefully, I unclasped the thong on my scabbard.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sound.  Not even the birds.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever had been in the tent was still nearby.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly, I emerged from the tent, looking about for my uninvited visitor.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was sitting on the log I had felled next to my fire pit, as relaxed as though it were his own camp.  It was a gnoll, the black of his fur was peppered with the white of age and his face was scarred from some long passed battle.  He wore a leather tunic and breeches, and an axe hung from a thong at his belt.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A heavy, leather bag sat on the log beside him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had come silently, and invisibly.   My pulse quickened and my hand fell to my sword.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He addressed me in broken common, &#8220;You&#8230;you like beerrr&#8230;.?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Uh&#8230;I&#8217;m sorry&#8230;&#8221; I said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His  paw gestured toward the crate beside me, &#8220;Beerr! Beerr!  You like?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was somewhat different from the greeting I had heard from other gnolls.  &#8220;Uhh&#8230;yes.  I like beer.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It grinned.  The edges of its mouth turning up and wrinkling its snout&#8212;showing a rake of yellowed, broken canine teeth.  Out of the bag, it produced a bottle.  Deftly, he flipped the cap off of it with one thumb.  &#8220;Good beerrr it is!  Best beerr it is!&#8221;  He took a long, sloppy swig, his tongue lapping it noisily out of the bottle as he poured it all over himself.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was drunk!  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A drunk gnoll in my camp?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Uhh&#8230;.yes, it is good beer.  I really don&#8217;t like beer much but this is good beer.  It&#8217;s uh&#8230;it&#8217;s gnoll beer&#8230;&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnoll slurped and lapped noisily as more beer slopped down the front of his tunic.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;&#8230;but I guess you know that.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gnoll released a humungous belch.  &#8220;Ahh&#8230;good gnoll beerrr!  My beerr it is!  Gnasher I am!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahhh&#8230;So this was Gnasher Furgut, the gnoll brewer!  Somehow I had envisioned him as a bit more, well&#8230;fearsome.  Younger and more sober, perhaps.  Antonius Bayle&#8217;s guards would like to find this one.  Gnasher Furgut was supposedly the brewer and vendor of Blackburrow Stout to Qeynos.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;You like my beerr!&#8221; he beamed proudly,  &#8220; It is therre in yourr little house-of-cloth!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood up  and let my hand fall from my sword.  He certainly didn&#8217;t  seem hostile.  If he&#8217;d wanted to kill me he could have done so without introducing himself.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Yes&#8230;.uh&#8230;your beer is very good.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnasher grinned a cracked-tooth, yellow gnoll grin, &#8220;Then drrrink with me, you must!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drink?  With a gnoll?  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm&#8230;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, he certainly didn&#8217;t seem to be a <b>typical</b> gnoll.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly and warily I seated mself on the log next to him and accepted the bottle from his furry paw.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the age-old relationship between the rangers of Surefall and the gnolls of Blackburrow Gnasher was totally at ease.  He deftly popped the cap on another beer and, very humanly, knocked his bottle against mine in toast.  &#8220;Health!&#8221; he said, slurping his beer sloppily all over himself.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Uhh...yes.  Health,&#8221; I Replied.  &#8220;May I ask you why you have not tried to kill me?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnasher snorted a beer-wet laugh, &#8220;Kill you, why?  You drrink my beerr!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Uhh, well, I am a human and you are gnoll.  I rather thought that was the way things worked.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Ahh&#8230;Blackburrrrow rrrulz, yes.  To hell with them!  That arrre foolz.  You arre customerrr.  Bad business to kill customerr&#8212;even for humanz.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought of that.&#8221;  I admitted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;You a Rrrangerr.  Rrangerrr rulz sayz to kill gnollz.  Why you not kill me?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took a cautious sip of beer, &#8220;Well, you rather surprised me.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnasher growled a chuckle and looked knowingly at me.  &#8220;You a smarrt pup.  You not like to kill.  Killing is forr foolz.  Drinking is for wizdom!  Blackburrow kill, kill, kill.  No one to drink beerr!  No one to play bonz!  No one to tell talez!  Killing is forr foolz!  Warr, warr, warr&#8230;.everrryone likez warr!  Not time for beerr!  Not time for bonz!  Bah.  Foolz they arre.  But I like beerr&#8230;&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Do the commanders and shamans of Blackburrow not like&#8230;.err&#8230;do they not like your beer?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Bah!  No.  Just like to make warr.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I see.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnasher took a long, tonguey slurp from his bottle, tilting his head back to get the last drop.  He contunued tilting back, and back&#8212;until his unconscious form rolled off the log.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm.  Well this was an interesting dilemma.  What if one of the Jaggedpine Treefolk saw this?  A drunk Gnoll passed out in my camp.  I could have killed him, I suppose.  The Qeynos guards would pay well for his head.  But that would not be right&#8212;certainly not honorable, anyway.  In retrospect I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, I draged him into my tent and let him sleep it off.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he awoke, he was only slightly different of temperment than before.  We revisited briefly why we had not tried to kill each other, and talked a bit more.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnasher was an orphan of Blackburrow&#8212;immigrated from Karana for some reason, long ago.  He was tolerated, but not welcomed by his own kind&#8212;who resented both his dealings with humans, and his lack of enthusiasm for killing them.  He too lived apart from his people, in a rather nice cabin far back in the hills behind Blackburrow.  It was there that he kept his brewbarrel and gardened the special hops and berries for his beer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seldom visited him that summer, but regularly he would stagger into my camp drunk and entice me to join him in beers and his favorite dice game.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After awhile I began to welcome the sound of his uncertian steps, crashing through the underbush into my camp. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He taught me how to play Bonz--a gnoll dice game, and we spent long hours at this.  However, I was never convinced I knew all the rules, as he consistently beat me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was one such night&#8230;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;HaHa!  One Bash, Thrree Fangs!  Beatz yourr Fourr Clawz!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at the arrangement of the shiny, carved bits of bone on the log in front of me, &#8220;No it doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;HaHa!  Yez it doez!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shook my head.  I was never going to understand this game.  I had almost given up trying to master all the rules.  The gnolls had seemed to me, always, to be a rather dim race.  Pea-brained, in fact.  But to master a game of such deep complexity as this Bonz game, they must have a well-disguised streak of genius.  Another copper changed hands.  Gnasher beamed a snarl-toothed grin of undisguised pride each time he took a copper from me.  There was no animosity though.  I could say with reasonable certainty, that we were friends.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I think you like this game too much Gnasher.  Have you ever thought of mastering something else.  Something like checkers perhaps?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnasher shrugged and passed me another beer.  &#8220;Bah!  Nothing is good az Bonz!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Now wait a minute.  How do you know that?  There are plently of other games out there.  Chess, Backgammon, King&#8217;s Trio, Bao; All kinds of card games too.  And all you play is Bonz?  That&#8217;s rather limited, don&#8217;t you think?  There is a lot more out there.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time in the months that I had known him, Gnasher scowled.  His yellow eyes were lit with a dim mix of anger and sorrow. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I know thiz.  You tell Gnasherr that the worrld iz biggerr than bonz?  You arre a pup!  Thirrty yearz and you still crringe around yourr Glade&#8212;hiding from people becauze you lost your mate?  Becauze you kill yourr enemy?  Ahh&#8230;.?  Gnasher trrick you, eh?  You don&#8217;t know I know thiz?  I know many thingz!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I waz grreatest Raider of Splitpaw!  I have seen all Karrana and Rrathe-Lake!  I even go to Qeynos morre than you!  Dangerruz!  Have to sneak!  But eat at human tablez with human friendz!  Do not talk to me like I am an old fool!  Old may&#8212;bee but no fool!  You want to play at chezz?  You want to play at bao?  Okay&#8212;but we play forr plat!  I play all thoze gamez!  And I will kick your hairrlezz, human tail!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am old now!  I make beerr.  I play bonz!  Not becauz I not know otherr gamez.  I like bonz.  I like beerr.  Life too shorrt to drrink waterr and play gamez you not like!  Life iz too shorrt to hide frrom it!  You arre the fool, Eshkin!  You arre hiding.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After his rant, Gnasher downed a few more beers and staggered back to his cabin, but his words still made me angry inside, and sad.  I thought much of Layla, and found myself crying most of the night. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the sun rose, however, I was bathed in a calm serenity and clarity of thought.  Gnasher was absolutely right.  Was I going to give up my whole life over that night&#8212;the life that had been spared?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were things to see, things to do.  Important things.  No idea what they were&#8230;but they were important.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to Qeynos that day, loaded heavy with skins.  Lacking sleep, I stayed the night at Fish&#8217;s and set out the next morning to sell my skins.  For the first time in a long time, the press and the sound of the streets of Qeynos felt good to me.  There was something happening to me.  I felt very alive.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having reprovisioned mysef, I set out at dusk for my camp again, but not without first stopping by Voleen&#8217;s Bakery and purchasing a few fresh pies for Gnasher, as well as some coffee and tobbacco.  It felt good to do.  I knew from talking with him that Gnasher had a taste for sweets, and I had never done my strange gnoll friend the honor of a gift before.  Considering the change that his words seem to have wrought in me over the last days, I concluded that it was appropriate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a forced march back to my camp and a quick nap, I struck out with my pack for Gnasher&#8217;s cabin.  I shortly found him out back, futzing with the brewbarrel.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stoked the fire in the hearth and boiled water for coffee.  I rolled us both some cigarettes (I had not had the money to afford the new, pre-rolled tobbacco sticks that were becoming high fashion for the Qeynos elite)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cut the pie and drank the coffee (Gnasher scalded his tongue, but enjoyed the novelty of fresh coffee immensely). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over breakfast  I told him the story of that night over two years ago, of the monster that took the form of Hager Sureshot.  I told him of its last word to me&#8230;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8230;Delicious&#8230;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat for a long moment, the smoke from his cigarette rising in lazy circles to the ceiling, staring his yellow-eyed stare at some invisible point in the distance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Dangerrouz thing this monsterr iz.  Change shape, change voice&#8230;and lovez pain and fearr, it doez.  Strong too&#8212;to thrrow you off that high place.  You arre big for a human.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took a drag off my cigarette, letting the buzz from the tobbacco calm the edginess that had suddenly risen in me.  &#8220;Have you ever heard of such a monster?&#8221; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnasher stared through the smoke into the distance, as though thinking far back into his past.  &#8220;Only in bad dreamz&#8230;&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We drank our coffee in silence for a moment, Gnasher lapping especially quietly from his cup, and making only a minimal mess.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I have to kill it.&#8221;  I announced.  &#8220;I even kept the arrow.  Although, at the time I didn&#8217;t know why.  I have to kill it or I can never be truly at peace.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;You, kill it, pup?  How will you find it?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;How you kill it?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8230;my bow, or my sword.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnasher laughed, &#8220;You die like a fool then.  Everr rraid Blackburrow?  Everr fight gnollz?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I have fought a gnoll.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;NO.  Have you fought <b>in</b> Blackburrow!?  Not one-gnoll hunting.  Twenty gnollz! Fourty gnollz!  You are a pup!  You must trravel.  To fight thiz thing you must be a <b>Grreat Rraiderr!</b>&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This last bit he almost shouted&#8230;err&#8230;howled.  Gnasher certainly got emotional when he talked about raiders and raiding.  It was a gnoll thing, I suppose.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I nodded.  He was right.  I had felt it back in Qeynos.  I needed to travel.  I knew nothing of the world beyond Qeynos.  I had heard of the Barbarians of the Everfrost Peaks and even seen them in Qeynos.  And the Erudites I had also seen, but only from a great distance.  It was time to expand my hunting grounds.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I was thinking of going to hunt in the Peaks.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gnasher leaned back and smiled his snarling smile, &#8220;Bewarre, Eshkin.  The rroad is the best of beerr!  Once you set yourr pawz in motion&#8230;.might be harrd to stop!  And it will be harrderr life sometimez than you think.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I smiled, &#8220;It&#8217;s just up to the Peaks, Gnasher.  How hard could it be?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tunare punishes arrogance.  At least my father always told me so.  Perhaps it was my jaunty remark at Gnasher&#8217;s table that had done it&#8212;or perhaps I simply left Tunare&#8217;s blessings back in Qeynos Hills, but Everfrost was not kind to me.  It was stark and beautiful&#8230;but not kind.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first attempt at hunting one of the exotic white bears of the plains almost cost me my life.  The hide and fur of these bears was tougher than anything I had ever encountered.  My first arrow, instead of crippling the beast, only enraged it, and it came barreling at me over the frozen ground.  My second arrow stuck in its hide unnoticed.  There was not time for a third arrow.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I valiantly reached for my sword, only to find it stuck solidly in the scabbard&#8212;frozen there from the cold.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, polar bears do not climb trees.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result was a bit humiliating.  The bear growled and roared for most of the day, beneath me.  Until a cadre&#8217; of Barbarian warriors happened by, attracted by the sound of the animal&#8217;s cries.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They spoke to each other in their native tongue for  bit, examinaing the situation, and laughing vigorously.  Finally their leader stepped forward a bit, &#8220;Ho there, Halfling!&#8221; he called, &#8220;What are ye seekin&#8217; up there?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They apparently found this pretty amusing.  &#8220;Nothing, really.  Just relaxing, and having a smoke.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again they conferred and laughed, &#8220;Very well, then!  We&#8217;ll be on our way!  Good huntin&#8217;, to ya, Halfling!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Alright, Alright!&#8221;  I cleared my throat. &#8220;I am not from here.  Can you tell me how to kill this bear?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Hmm&#8230;have ya been shooting him with arrows?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Well, don&#8217; do  that, it does na work!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Yes, I discovered that!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Well, have ya skewered &#8216;m on yer sword?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;No.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Why not?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Because it&#8217;s frozen into the scabbard!&#8221; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the leader turned to translate my words, several of the hunting party actually fell the ground and rolled in the snow in mirth.  For the better part of a half hour, each one of them in turn would speak in Barbarian and all the others would roll on the ground laughing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bear was the only one not laughing.  It looked very serious.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last the leader of the warriors wiped the tears from his eyes and spoke again in common, &#8220;Alright, Halfling!  We&#8217;ll help ya out.  But in the the future ya ought na hunt up here.  G&#8217;back ta the hills and the vales.  This is hard land up here.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, the warriors abruptly produced, seemingly from nowhere, a forest of heavy swords, axes and spears and simply hacked the bear to death. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they strolled off into the tundra laughing to themselves in Barbarian.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat up in the tree for some time and rolled myself a cigarette with the last of the tobbacco that I had bought in Qeynos.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that is how you do it.  You just hack it apart.  Just like that&#8230;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Barbarians were the toughest men I had ever seen.  Was I a little out of my depth here?  Surefall and Qeynos Hills were so tame compared to Everfrost.  I started to wonder if I could make it here or not.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things didn&#8217;t get much better form there.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just outside Halas, I used the last of my copper to buy some blade oil&#8212;in hopes that I would not suffer the frozen sword problem again.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjusting my expectations, I discovered quickly that I could kill the white wolves of Everfrost&#8230;and the very small polar bear cubs.  Unfortunately, barbarians are huge people and the small pelts of the wolves brought me next to nothing from the merchants of Halas.  Even when I was able to bring down a polar bear cub, the disdain of the Barbarians was evident in the prices that they gave me on my skins.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everfrost was a hard land, as the warrior had told me that day.  My bow was no longer sufficient to bring down game and I would frequently have to engage it in melee.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My meager savings was dwindling.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was out of arrow points and blade oil.  But worse still, my boots were wearing thin.   Everfrost&#8217;s bitter cold I could not last without good boots.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I needed money.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this point I had not dallied too long in the town of Halas.  The stares and hushed voices of the tall, fur-clad barbarians were warning enough.  I was not welcome here.  However, Halas now had something I needed.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had a public forge.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Located just outside the armorer&#8217;s shop, the elders of the Six Hammers had erected a forge for any and all who wished to use it.  Presumably this was to encourage the skill of smithing among the citizens of Halas.  A town can never have too many smiths.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it happened, Halas had very few.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had not fully stoked the forge before a young barbarian walked up.  His face was painted in blue war paint.  He was obviously a warrior.  He looked quizically at me and then at the forge.  I stared back at him for a moment and continued firing the forge.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Ya a smithy, Halfling?&#8221; he asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I scowled a bit.  &#8220;Acutally, I&#8217;m a human.  Halflings are a bit shorter than me, even.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;But ya are a smithy?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From under the folds of his furs he produced a battle axe.  To this day I am constantly amazed at the menagerie of places that barbarians can hide the largest weapons.  It was in pitiful shape.  The head pitted and cracked and rattling loosely on its haft.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I got this off a gnoll.  Can ye touch it up?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Aye friend.  I can touch it up.  If you have some coin I&#8217;d much appreciate it though.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short order I filed down the edges and finished them hot with stone and hammer.  Then  shimmed the head down tight.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had not fogotten everything from a boyhood at the forge.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I handed it back to him I shoved it into a drift, to cool and wiped it clean with a cloth.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took it from me eagerly and spun it over in his hands.  He was a large man.  He handled the heavy axe as though it were a child&#8217;s toy.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His boyish face beamed as though it were one as well.  &#8220;I canna believe me eyes!  Is like it&#8217;s new!  You really are a smithy, Halfling!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Err&#8230;Human&#8230;&#8221; I protested.  My protest was interrupted as he dropped a platinum piece, thick and heavy, into my hand.  &#8220;Or Halfling&#8230;whichever is easier for you, really&#8230;&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In only a few hours,  a trickle of other warriors and hunters began to flow to the forge.  By nightfall, I had a queue.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it happens, there is almost no smithing interest in Halas--because the nearest ore mines are all the way in Highpass.  Most of the limited weapons and armor available to the Barbarians are either taken from the goblins, orcs or gnolls, or are imported from Qeynos.  Smithing weapons and armor (the highest art of a blacksmith) is just not profitable in Halas, and so, no smith of significant skill ever stays to ply his trade there&#8230;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving no one to sharpen and repair the Barbarians&#8217; weapons&#8230;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until now.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worked into the night, and word of my presence at the long-dead public forge quickly spread through the town.  Some were indifferent to me, most were a bit threatening&#8212;men and women alike&#8212;but they all paid.  Grudgingly, they acepted my work, and filled my purse.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a welcome change.  At least I wasn&#8217;t wading through waist-deep snow or sleeping in trees trying to wait out angry bears.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was down on my knees with the iron door to the coal-catch at the base of the forge open, trying to scrape the excess coke into an already overful bucket when a blur from the side caught my eye.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider myself very fortunate that I got my hands out of the way in time, as a Barbarian boot slammed the coal-catch shut with a resounding clang.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My face flushed with rage as, cursing, I jumped to my feet and faced down the owner of that boot.  Standing with my chest out, at my full height, I was able to look him straight in the sternum.  And his two friends were just as large as he.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;What ye doin&#8217; Halfling?  This is a Barbarian forge&#8230;&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Aye,&#8221; I said, &#8220;And I am using it to repair Barbarian weapons.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Yer no welcome here&#8230;we don&#8217; need ya.  You got good Babarian gold in yer purse from swindling these folks, Halfling.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reputed to be naieve, to this day, but it didn&#8217;t take much to see what was happening here.  &#8220;Yes, you are right, sir.  It is good Barbarian coin.  I have charged a fair fee and my customers are happy.  I can see you are a warrior.  Perhaps you&#8217;d like a weapon touched up&#8230;free of charge&#8230;as a sample of my work&#8230;&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response, a fist pounded into the side of my head&#8212;not his&#8212;one of his friends had grown weary of my trying to diffuse a fight, and elected to get straight to the bashing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were three of them all much larger than me&#8212;and frankly&#8212;all better warriors than me.  I was a &#8220;Halfling&#8221;--a foreigner.  One of the many times I thudded to the ground I blearily noticed the Barbarian guard looking very engaged, pretending to lecture one of the crowd that was gathering to watch the &#8216;Halfling&#8217; take a beating.  No help from the guards.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the record, I did fight back&#8212;not very well though.  When one is a child, brawls are more like a game.  Wild punches are thrown until someone gets a bloody nose and cries &#8220;uncle&#8221;.  Grown men fight more for hate&#8217;s sake&#8230;and consequences are much more serious.  I simply hoped they wouldn&#8217;t beat me to death.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broken ribs, broken nose&#8230;eyes tight shut agianst the blood burning in them.   I was reeling from pain and shock.  I couldn&#8217;t stand under my own power&#8230;so the three of them helped me to my feet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Ye like our forge, d&#8217;ya, Halfling?  Why d&#8217;ya not take a closer look at it.  You&#8217;ll see it&#8217;s a Barbarian forge&#8230;&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One huge hand twined itself into my hair and pressd my head forward, into the forge.   I could feel the rising heat through the blood and cuts&#8230;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And suddenly my eyes and ears were filled with eerie sond, and a bright blue light&#8230;in a second, my wounds vanished, and I felt the hands holding me relax.  I stumbled away from the heat, wiping the blood from my eyes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd had parted, making way for two newcomers.  From the painted marks on their faces and the staves in their hands, I knew them to be shamans&#8212;holy men of the Six Hammers, and mystics who drew their power from the spirits of their animal totems.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One was much older than the other.  It was he who spoke now.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Moradorf, what are ye doin&#8217;?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brute&#8217;s friends, quickly abandoned him, fading back into the crowd.  Moradorf (apparently his name) glanced back and forth quickly, realizing that something had changed.  &#8220;Master Khondoran, this halfling was swindlin&#8217; gold fer smithin&#8217; he took me gold and dinna gimme nothin!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old shaman stepped quietly into the ring of the crowd and looked about at the faces.  He paused at me, and his blue eyes looked deeply into mine, curiously.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Kheldan!&#8221; he called to the younger shaman, &#8220;This is a friend of yours, this halfling?&#8221;&#8217;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Aye Master, he is my friend from Qeynos&#8212;he is a blacksmith.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked quizically at the younger mystic.  He was younger than me, perhaps five years.   His beard and hair were a ruddy blonde, touched with white.  I had never seen him before in my life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or had I?  There was something&#8230;familiar about him&#8230;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Khondoran continued, &#8220;&#8230;Is he an honest halfling?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Aye, Master, he is.&#8221; Kheldan replied.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old shaman turned back to Mordorf, &#8220;You ye have anythin&#8217; further, Moradorf?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moradorf bowed his head, &#8220;Nay, sir.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Then I think it&#8217;s time fer ya to go home.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Aye.  Thank ye sir.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a wave of his hand the old shaman dismissed the crowd, who quietly, and respectfully disbursed.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was left to my own to pick up the scattered mess of my things from around the forge.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, almost to myself&#8230;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Are you hurt still?&#8221;  It was Kheldan.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Hmm&#8230;no, not really, just my pride.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Master Kohndoran&#8217;s healing is powerful&#8230;but it can&#8217;t help that, I fear.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I balanced my pack on the edge of the forge and tried tying it all back together.  &#8220;So&#8230;If I may ask&#8230;why did you and your master interfere with that little fight back there.  I thought all <b>halflings</b> were more or less better beaten and burned than not, in this town.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Well, it wasn&#8217;t a fair fight.  There were three of them.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I laughed bitterly.  &#8220;Well, it wouldn&#8217;t have been fair if there were just <b>one</b> of them.  You didn&#8217;t notice that he was a bit <b>bigger</b> than me?&#8221;  I looked the young barbarian up and down.  He was not big for a barbarian, but he still towered above me.  &#8220;Hmph&#8230;no I suppose you didn&#8217;t.  In any event&#8230;I&#8217;m sorry, I don&#8217;t mean to be ungrateful.  Thank you for vouching for me.  You likely saved my life.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stopped packing my pack and looked at him again.  Even through their crude dress of skins and furs the barbarians were a striking people.  The looked rough and noble.  But there was something about this one that struck me.  He looked so familiar&#8230;it was eerie.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kheldan shifted the tip of his staff in the snow and looked about nervously.  When he spoke, his voice was hushed, &#8220;Those scars on your arms, where did you come by them?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;In a drunk wrestling match with a crocodile.&#8221;  I replied.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He scowled, looking puzzled.  I was never any good at humor.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;These scars were given to me in a fight with a monster.  The druids of Surefall Glade tell me they cannot be healed.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded knowingly, &#8220;What kind of monster?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stopped my packing and stared at him.  &#8220;Why does this interest you.  It&#8217;s something I&#8217;d rather not discuss.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response he pulled aside his thick bear-hide cloak and lifted up his jherkin.  On his chest&#8230;from throat to navel was a deep, ragged, greusome scar.  &#8220;Tis true.  The scars the creature leaves can not be healed.  This I have had since I was an infant.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to make one understand what I felt at this moment.  It was sadness, despair&#8230;.yet mixed with hope&#8230;.and excitement.  Suddenly, I was here with this strange mystic&#8212;this barbarian&#8212;and we were participating in some kind of rite.  Some secret brotherhod pact.  For the first time in years I flelt an instant bond form.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kheldan was a gracious host.  I stayed that night in the Shaman&#8217;s guild on a straw mat next to the huge stone hearth.  The following day, I spent a good deal of the money from the night before on resupplying myself.  New fur-lined boots, plenty of arrow points, dried provisions, blade oil and tobbacco were the order of the day.  For all the crude amenities in Halas, their tobbacco shop (a place called Dok&#8217;s) is very well-stocked and turns a thriving business.  The rough-and-tumble warriors of the North may not have the money, day-to-day to care properly for their weapons, but many a goblin and gnoll has met an untimely demise for the sake of a fine cigar.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talked as friends and were instantly comfortable in the presence of each other.  We spoke of our families and our past and our hopes&#8230;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8230;And, for the first time, we spoke of the creature.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kheldan was not only Khondoran&#8217;s aprentice, he was his ward.  Twenty-five years ago, Kheldan&#8217;s family had been attacked by the monster.  Kheldan&#8217;s father, shaman of great renown, battled the creature, while his mother, placed the baby&#8217;s pram on their dog-sled and whipped the dogs away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least that is the theory.  No one who was old enough to remember the battle survived to tell the tale.  Khondoran used all his healing powers to save the wounded infant, and still only just succeeded.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The massive war party assembled by the Wolves of the North was not so fortunate.  Their corpses were found in mass&#8230;dismembered and scattered about the burnt wreckage of Khledan&#8217;s parents&#8217; house.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Khondoran had a name for the beast.  It was the One Without Form&#8230;.it was The Doppleganger.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talked long about it.  For the first time, I recalled the night of Layla&#8217;s death clearly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we drank and ate and talked--long into the next night&#8212;smoking our tobbacco and reflecting.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What could this creature do, if it had mind to do so?  What sorrow could it reap in Quenos?  Or in Halas?  Or in all of Norrath?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night will live in my mind forever&#8230;it is the night my life  had been building to for thirty-one years.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Erudites say that a life without reflection, is a life unlived.  I have found that there is some truth to this&#8212;so I shall reflect now--on this night in Halas.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beleive that going out into Everfrost, to try and earn my keep had empowered me.  I was not relegated to Surefall, or Qeynos.  I was a hunter&#8212;perhaps my technique with polar bears needed some refinement, but I was skilled.  The loss of my Layla had made me stronger than I could have been, even as her love brought me alive while she was with me.  Gnasher Furgut had taught me, also&#8230;the precious value of life and its fleeting nature.  And now my new friend Kheldan&#8230;a brother by blood, somehow&#8230;a brother in the Monster&#8230;a brother in the Doppleganger&#8212;his presence opened up a world of possibilities.  It opened up a future.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we talked together, the way these things fit together began to become clear to me.  I thought back all the way to my thirteeth year, as a boy in Surefall, holding in my hands the enchanted bow of Tamryn Scholl.  My fascintation with the bow was not the fascination with the bow itself&#8212;it was what that bow represented to me.  It was adventure.  It was action.  It was danger in high places for a higher ideal.  It was heroism.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The candles were burning low, and the tavern was empty.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;&#8230;It can take the form of anything it chooses,&#8221; said Kheldan.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;&#8230;and the voice.&#8221; I added.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;And it feeds on sorrow&#8212;on terror.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Aye, it seems to enjoy it immensely.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a long pause.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cleared my throat.  &#8220;Ahem&#8230;that&#8217;s it?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kheldan thought a moment and nodded, &#8220;Aye.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;That is not much to go on.  We need to know more.  Much more.  The monster must have a weakness&#8230;or at least a home.  Does Halas have a place of knowledge&#8230;a hall of records?  Perhaps we could look at records of untimely deaths to learn more?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kheldan shook his head.  &#8220;We are a people of oral tradition, Eshkin.  Khondoran has already told me all he knows.  We learn to write and read your language only so we can deal with outsiders.  We have no need o&#8217; such things in Halas.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm.  No wonder they called them Barbarians.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought for a moment.  Kheldan was feeling the same strange elation I was; I could see it in his eyes.  We were balanced on a moment of decision.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Well,&#8221; I said at length, &#8220;Are you up for a journey?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His slow smile was answer enough.  &#8220;To where?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I carefully rolled and lit my last cigarette on the flame of the ebbing candle, rolling the options over in my mind.  A feeling of peace settled over me as the decision was made.  I knew that Tunare&#8217;s blessing was with me again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I know a place that makes beautiful glass.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Beginning&#8230;<br>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;It&#8217;s a good plan I tell ya!&#8221; hastened Izzi, his shining purple robe shifting color ever so slightly to a soft metallic gray and then back to purple.  &#8220;It has to work.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the party sat around him staring in disbelief.  Izzi Fizzlethorpe, or so he called himself, was possibly the smartest Wizard Dreugh had ever met in his life.  He was a master of just about every skill known to mankind, (where he found the time and money to invest into these skills, the group never knew) and he used them all with good intent.  But mostly he was a Wizard, with enough of the arcane powers to roast many of the wandering nuisances of Norath in a single blast.  He was taller than most normal humans, an Erudite by race.  Most of the Erudites had shunned his abilities, claiming that he was unfocused on his studies and too preoccupied with the life of an adventurer rather than a scholar like the other members of his race.  Dreugh usually turned his nose up at the &#8220;Holier than thou&#8221; attitude of the Erudites, but Izzi was different.  More than once, he had been a formidable friend, and Dreugh was proud to be a member of his group.  He was a brilliant tactician, and everyone always placed their fate in his hands without question, knowing that he had thoroughly researched the situation at hand.  This time, however, Dreugh was quite skeptical&#8230; and judging from the look of his companions, they were not much further off from the same opinion as he.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dreugh surveyed his companions, he reflected the emotions radiating from the very essence of their being.  Goyr Holyblade: Paladin of great strength and virtue.  Dreugh had met Goyr for the first time when he had met Izzi, as they were traveling together when they decided to form their small union.  Goyr was just about the hairiest Dwarf that Dreugh had ever met.  His thick red hair seemed to grow from everywhere, and Dreugh could swear that he could even see hair coming through the Paladin&#8217;s armor sometimes.  Dreugh chuckled to himself over the thought and continued his assessment. Goyr had proven to be a most valuable team member, as well as a good friend. Barely reaching up to Dreugh&#8217;s chest, Goyr had to be the strongest Dwarf he had seen to date.  His melee skills were equaled by few for someone of his experience and his minor magical abilities granted to him from his Paladin gods had come in most useful when Dreugh had found himself spent from magical encounters.  Dreugh had also found a very important quality in the Dwarf: a good drinking companion.  Gods!  The little guy could drink several regular men under the table and go a-blazing into battle without a hindrance.  He really respected the Dwarf, and hoped to have many more encounters side by side with him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreugh looked over to Gwynedd.  She was a dazzling sight to behold.  Possibly the most beautiful Wood Elf Dreugh had ever seen, (and he had seen SO many in those taverns in Kelethin where&#8230; um, that&#8217;s another story) this female Bard had the voice of golden honey.  Dreugh could swear that when she sang certain songs, he could actually fight better, feel stronger, or run faster.  Her face was sharp and fine, much like the Ykesha sword she carried at her hip.  Dreugh had learned all too quick how tough the slight Bard could be, and welcomed her strength as well as her beauty.  She was a recent, but welcome, addition to the party, and she currently stared dreamily into Izzi&#8217;s eyes.  Dreugh had suspected a love affair between the two from the start (not like they were hiding it) and was happy to see that his friend had found someone to share his heart with.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then himself.  Dreugh Deadsbane.  He saw himself as a tall High Elf, taller than most and very lean with a pale white complexion and the albino type features that befit most of the High Elves of Felwithe.  Dreugh had chosen the Cleric&#8217;s path of life, or he should say Tunare had chosen him for the task.  Growing up in Felwithe, Dreugh never saw himself as a holy individual, but a vision of Tunare in a local church brought the all too swift conversion to faith and belief in the Mother of All.  Dreugh was hardly a fighter, even though he was a rather temperate and impetuous youth, and decided to place his energies into the spiritual and religious.  Soon, though, he would discover that like most Clerics, he had developed a distinct disliking for the Undead inhabitants of Norath. He then visited the head priest of his guild and asked to be placed on a pilgrimage to deliver Felwithe, and all of Norath, from the vile clutches of the Undead.  However, what he never realized he would find is that Norath was in need of further deliverance than the evil of Undead creatures.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#8217;s when he met up with the other members of his group, and where he found himself right now, trying to figure out how he had gotten into such a mess.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;You know, Izz,&#8221; he said, &#8220;last time we tried this we nearly met Tunare a little earlier than I had planned to in life.&#8221;  Dreugh remembered all too well when Izzi had brought them to Permafrost and they attempted to do a little Ice Goblin hunting, and found that they were a little over matched for the tribes of goblins that seemed to spew from the mountains of North Antonica.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Izzi shrugged in his ever-so-non-chalant manner and said, &#8220;Hey that wasn&#8217;t my fault.  How did I know there was a goblin breeding ground that close to where we were?&#8221;  As he spoke, his ever-present smirk came through and Dreugh couldn&#8217;t help but chuckle again.  No matter how many crazy schemes Izzi came up with, everything always seemed to go all right in the end.  He was, however, still a little skeptical about this latest scheme.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His concern subsided slightly when Goyr blasted out, &#8220;The gods will grant us strength in our battle, as they always have before, and we will be the righteous victors this day.&#8221;  Then he flashed his big yellow-toothed grin and said, &#8220;Have ye no sense of adventure, Cleric-friend?  Izzi knows what he does, and will make sure we survive, like always.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreugh flashed his own grin in response, and retorted, &#8220;Goyr, I have no doubts of our friends&#8217; tactical and leadership abilities, since they are far better than mine.  But I think this time he has gone a bit far.  Just look at what he has in store for us!&#8221;  Dreugh gestured from the thicket in which they had been hiding and pointed straight at the biggest and ugliest monster he had ever seen.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Izzi had promised him a good adventure this day, but he never said anything about a Cyclops!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beast was huge, almost as tall as a Hill Giant, and his features couldn&#8217;t have been more grotesque if they tried.  The monster&#8217;s teeth were long and spiked, and fit row by row in an oversized mouth.  It had one great big eye in the center of its face, and a forehead that made it look as if it may topple over from its immense size.  The rest of it&#8217;s body could be described as overweight, but with a strength that would uproot a tree, or tear apart a poor passing adventurer with a child&#8217;s ease.  When he was young he could remember the village elders claiming of such a monstrosity, but found it to be too unbelievable then.  He wished he had listened now.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;BAH!&#8221; came the reply from his hairy friend.  &#8220;Ye just watch what I do with me trusty Deepwater Harpoon when I get a hold of this beastie!&#8221;  Dreugh couldn&#8217;t help but smile.  He still remembered the day when he and Goyr had gotten a bit too drunk for their own good and started a fight with another party of adventurers.  Goyr had lifted the biggest member of their party (a barbarian warrior, no  less) off the ground by his, uh, sensitive area, and promised to shove the large harpoon up the warrior&#8217;s arse sideways if they didn&#8217;t depart swiftly and risk making him angry.  He was laughing through the entire ordeal.  Dreugh had though himself a dead man, when the warrior actually shuddered and passed out and the other members of his party actually ran, quickly.  Dreugh never underestimated the strength of a drunken Dwarf thereafter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then, Gwynedd held up her hand in a gesture of silence and placed her finger to her lips to accent the need.  The Cyclops had been inspecting something on the ground, and now bent over to the pile which from where they were looked to be a mass of dirt.  Gwynedd gasped and paled, and Goyr cursed something under his breath in his guttural Dwarven language.  Izzi just stoically looked on and Dreugh edged forward to see what they had seen.  Only his battle-hardened stomach kept him from retching and nearly losing the lunch he consumed earlier.  The Cyclops was standing not over a pile of dirt, but a recently unfortunate adventurer who apparently was not lucky enough to defeat or avoid the beast.  But what made it even worse was what the monster was doing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;He&#8217;s eating him..!&#8221; Dreugh gasped.  He didn&#8217;t realize he had spoke out loud until his companions shot him a quieting glare.  The Cyclops continued his meal undisturbed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Izzi broke from his watch and walked a few paces behind the group.  He then sat in a cross-legged position and removed a long dagger from his robe.  The athamae gleamed a blood red, and Izzi used it to begin drawing a circle on the ground.  Within the circle, he drew archaic symbols of power, while he removed a skin bag from his robe (Dreugh wondered where he found room in that thin robe for all those artifacts) and poured out several runes of bone with similar symbols on them.  As he drew the symbols, he began to chant in an ancient and forgotten language of magic.  He then finished his drawing and after replacing the items in his robe, placed his hands on his knees and continued his chant, eyes rolling back in his head to reveal only the whites.  Dreugh began to notice the nexus of power growing around his friend (something he noticed he could do when he first realized his own magical talent) and new it was time to prepare for the fight.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to see his other companions had gotten the hint as well.  Goyr had stuck his harpoon point down into the dirt and knelt on one knee in front of it, muttering something in an Old Dwarven tongue.  Dreugh&#8217;s Dwarven was poor, but he managed to make out words like &#8220;strength&#8221; and &#8220;victory&#8221;, along with other prayers to the Paladin god he worshiped.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gwynedd was leaning against a tree, quietly tuning her mandolin, almost as much a weapon as her sword.  She compared the notes coming from the stringed instrument to the perfect notes she sang.  Dreugh felt his heart soar and his body relax at the notes she played, and she hadn&#8217;t even started playing a melody yet.  The Bard glanced and noticed him staring.  She offered a grin and a wink, and went back to work on tuning.  Dreugh couldn&#8217;t help but grin like a little boy.  Izzi was a lucky man.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then decided to make some preparations of his own.  He removed the shield he carried at his back.  It gleamed iridescent silver, and had a dull gray cross painted in the center.  Ever since he had acquired the shield, he had noticed that his mana abilities had increased dramatically, giving him the ability to cast longer and more spells.  He then removed the mace hanging from his belt loop.  The mace was a deep enameled black color, unnaturally so.  It was an effective weapon in his adventures, and these days felt almost like an extension of his own arm.  He then knelt down on both knees and spread his arms wide and to his side.  He looked up into the trees and sky, and down to the earth and land.  He said his own silent prayer to Tunare in Elder Elvish, using the more proper syntax to address his deity.  A cascading light from above the trees beamed down on him, gleaming off of his freshly polished armor and created a splendid rainbow that Dreugh felt he could ride into battle on.  He could feel the sudden rush of power in the blessing that soon followed and his eyes opened wide.  He knew that this day Tunare would be by their side in the fight.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Ahem,&#8221; came the beckon from his side.  Dreugh then looked to each of his party members as they stood beside him cross-armed and waiting.  How long had he been there?  He quickly stood and retrieved his weapons.  &#8220;Are you ready now, Sir Cleric?&#8221; came the whimsical question from Izzi.  &#8220;Because we&#8217;ve got a job to do.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreugh smiled and replied, &#8220;Almost.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He placed his hands in front of himself and began to chant.  He wove his hands in a delicate pattern, left and right, up and down, and completed the spell.  He felt the rush of extra energy surge into his body, adding to his strength and vitality.  He then cast a spell of magical armor to protect himself for physical attack.  With his personal protective barriers completed, he repeated the spells for each of his companions and watched their appreciative nods as each received the castings.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Izzi then beckoned the group back to their original spot where the Cyclops was about half way through his adventurer lunch.  Somehow the beast looked bigger than before, as if he had somehow grown in a manner of minutes.  Dreugh then noticed for the first time that the Cyclops had a giant sword at his hip.  The sword looked as if it could easily cleave his body in two, as a kitchen knife would a tomato.  Izzi motioned the group closer and they huddled around him to listen to the plan.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Okay,&#8221; he started.  &#8220;This is what we&#8217;ll do.  Goyr, you run point and take the beast head on, keep his attention from me long enough to cast some spells.  I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll have to take most of the hits in the beginning.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goyr grinned his big yellow-toothed grin and belted, &#8220;Bah!  He won&#8217;t know what hit &#8216;em!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Izzi smiled his own little smile, and replied, &#8220;Good.  Now Dreugh, I need you to stay back a bit and watch our vitality.  You will need to heal us if you can.  If the battle looks to be going well, you&#8217;re more than welcome to throw one of those little Cleric attack spells.  But I prefer you don&#8217;t.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreugh knew this speech pretty well, for Izzi used it just about every time they went into battle.  Dreugh&#8217;s response was a curt nod and a, &#8220;Will do,&#8221; before Izzi turned his attention over to the next party member.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he did, Gwynedd smiled her most disarming smile (Gods!  How he wished she wouldn&#8217;t DO that!).  Izzi then whispered, &#8220;Now, Love.  As much as I would just love to tell you to sit back, sing and look pretty, I cannot.  I am afraid I need your skills at the blade as well.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her smile then became a wicked grin as she punched Izzi in the shoulder.  The blow took him off guard and he fell back, a mildly defeated look on his face that read, &#8220;What was that for?&#8221;  She then retorted, &#8220;Am I not a member of this party also?  I can hack it with the best of you, and have before.  Do not treat me as some weak child or unable woman.&#8221;  And with that she offered hand to Izzi and he grasped it and rose.  He rubbed his shoulder grinning and Dreugh was once again reminded that her small exterior was no reflection of the warrior spirit that dwelled within her.  Just to show that she wasn&#8217;t angry, she reached over and planted a big kiss on Izzi&#8217;s lips.  Dreugh watched the two melt into each other, and envied the relationship that was steadily growing between them.  He glanced at Goyr who seemed to be admiring some rocks in the corner of the forest.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two separated and regained their composure.  Izzi then addressed the group once more.  &#8220;Now, if we&#8217;re ready, let&#8217;s go.&#8221;  He moved to the edge of the open area that the Cyclops inhabited and signaled a halt.  He turned to the group and mouthed, &#8220;On three.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreugh readied himself, mentally checking his equipment and weapons.  This was the part of adventuring that was the least and most fun at the same time.  The thrill of battle and driving back the enemy for the goodness of the land was something he was born to do.  However, getting hurt in the process was something he did not relish at all.  In fact, he down right detested it.  Such was the price to pay to fulfill his destiny.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Izzi held up his index finger to represent the number one.  He currently had his gaze locked on the Cyclops and concentrated on the task at hand.  Dreugh felt the pit of his stomach churn like someone just dropped him from the top of the highest tree in Kelethin and he was watching the floor of the great forest of Greater Faydark plunge towards him.  It was mildly disconcerting, but Dreugh managed to place his fears in the back of his mind long enough to realize that his knuckles were turning white from gripping his mace.  He relaxed his grip, and his body and waited for the next step.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Izzi held up two fingers and Dreugh almost felt a rekindled wave of nausea.  He thought he might pass out from the mental ordeal, but he managed to quell his fears once again and concentrate more at the task at hand.  But before he could realize what was going on, or even before Izzi signaled for three, Dreugh noticed a small, hairy figure in bronzed armor running across the open field screaming a bloodthirsty war cry.  Dreugh looked to his left where the Dwarf was standing at his side a second ago and, sure enough, he was no longer standing there.  &#8220;For the glory of Kaladim!&#8221; Bellowed the Dwarf, and he spat other things in his guttural language before running down on the still unsuspecting Cyclops.  He was waving his Deepwater Harpoon in the air as his little legs ran him towards his target.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreugh and the rest of his group moaned and ran after their companion.  They should have known that their impatient little friend would try something like this.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goyr was almost upon the beast when it looked up from its meal unconcerned (for what stupid creature dare attack a Cyclops alone?) and managed to actually duck out of the intended deathblow aimed at its oversized single eye.  Goyr stumbled from the force of his own momentum and the unfortunate miss and almost fell over.  The Cyclops stood to its full height and roared its challenge at the Paladin, unaware that the rest of the party was behind him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreugh looked to his right and saw that Izzi was already beginning his first spell, a blue-gray nimbus of power surrounded his hands and was growing wider and wider.  Gwynedd was singing a battle chant that Dreugh could already feel grant him strength to his muscles.  Goyr was recovering from his miss, but the Cyclops was already drawing his massive sword from the scabbard.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreugh quickly mouthed the words to a minor stun spell and aimed it at the Cyclops.  He was amazed when he was thrown back a few steps and noticed the creature had some sort of natural magical immunity to his spell.  Dreugh noticed Izzi scowl in disappointment at the failed attempt, even though he was in the middle of his own casting.  He could almost hear the disapproving scold from his friend, &#8220;I said heal, damn you!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what he didn&#8217;t notice is that the Cyclops had stopped his advance slightly on Goyr to glance at Dreugh long enough for him to recover from his stumble and ready for battle.  Dreugh grinned at the not-so-failed attempt at a distraction and saw Gwynedd sneak behind the monster and slice at it&#8217;s Achilles tendon.  The Cyclops threw its hands up in a bellow of pain and anger and turned his attention towards the Bard.  She was already retreating and just barely managed to avoid a crushing deathblow from the beast&#8217;s fist.  It was incredibly fast for a creature so large, but not fast enough to catch the wily Bard.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then, Izzi managed to get off his spell, and what a spell it was!  Dreugh could feel the blast streak by at impossible speed and catch the beast square in the chest.  He was not so lucky to resist the spell this time, and actually toppled back a few steps from the impact.  The beast howled in rage and fury and Dreugh felt his teeth chatter from the hatred it the scream.  It was hurt from the blow, and that only seemed to fuel its desire to kill ever more.  It began an advance on Izzi, its massive sword held over its head meant to cleave the Wizard in twain.  Izzi had already begun his second spell.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then, Goyr took his Harpoon and hefted it like a javelin.  He wound up way back and heaved it at the Cyclops.  It struck the beast square in the back below the neckline on its shoulder blade.  It looked as though a toothpick had hit it, but the shaft sank deep and managed to get another bellow of pain from the monster.  It never stopped its advance on the Wizard.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreugh needed to think fast.  He summoned the forces of his mana store and shaped them into a smiting blast, aimed at the head of the beast.  The blast stuck home, but only managed to do minimal damage to the Cyclops, and never seemed to stop its advance.  The Wizard was done for.  He would never finish that spell before the Cyclops split him down the middle.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;HEY, UGLY!&#8221;  came the sudden taunt from behind the beast.  Dreugh was dumbfounded when the beast actually stopped and he looked around to see where the taunt came from.  &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m talkin&#8217; to you, you overstuffed bag of dragon dung!&#8221;  The beast whirled around and stared at his newest target.  Goyr stood in the center of the clearing with an arrow knocked in his bow, aimed for the upper portion of the beast&#8217;s torso.  &#8220;You know, if I was you, I&#8217;d cut me own ugly head off to spare meself the pain of having to look at such a hideous creature.&#8221;  Dreugh was amazed at the bravery that exuded from the Dwarf.  But he also remembered something else he was once told.  The Cyclops understood Common Tongue, so Goyr&#8217;s taunts were quite effective in distracting the beast.  It set off again, after the Dwarf, its fury renewed and its bloodlust rekindled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goyr let loose the arrow he had knocked and it went straight and true to its intended target: the Cyclops&#8217; eye.  But somehow, the beast once again showed its amazing speed and was able to deflect the arrow with its massive hand as if swatting a fly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goyr threw down his bow and pulled free his Crystalline Sword and shield.  The sword was as clear as the daylight and looked like it was made of glass.  But Dreugh knew that the enchantments laid upon the blade made it stronger than any normal metal.  Goyr threw his hands up and roared his challenge at the mighty beast.  He was actually going to challenge the thing toe to toe!  He couldn&#8217;t even be much larger than the beast&#8217;s foot, and yet he stood fast and awaited his opponent.  A brave fool indeed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his momentary panic, Dreugh lacked the ability to think up a spell that would distract the beast, and watched as it lumbered closer and closer to its intended victim.  Goyr was grinning so big that he could actually see the yellow-toothed grin from where he was standing.  Izzi finally managed to get off his second spell, which was a blazing spiral of fire that connected with the Cyclops&#8217; backside and set him on fire.  Aside from a small flinch, the beast never stopped its advance.  Gwynedd managed to get in close and take another slice at its leg, but this time it bounced off harmlessly as the beast&#8217;s natural skin gave it protection from such things.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreugh shot off another spell of his own, which did surprisingly more damage than the first, but still not enough to slow the beast&#8217;s advance.  Once again, one of his friends looked as though he may be on the brink of death.  The Cyclops heaved its mighty sword in the air and swung down upon Goyr.  He managed to just barely avoid the blow and take a swipe of his own.  The Crystalline Sword sunk deep into the leg of the Cyclops, and Goyr pulled it free just as quickly with a triumphant &#8220;HA!&#8221;, and a black-red blood fountain erupted from the beast&#8217;s leg.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then the Cyclops brought down its other arm and dealt a crushing blow, which caught Goyr across the back and sent him flying across the field.  &#8220;NOOO!!&#8221; screamed all three remaining companions in unison.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Izzi somehow managed to get off another spell with a quickness Dreugh had never seen him do.  A pillar of ice shot towards the Cyclops and caught him in the side.  The monster stammered and managed to somehow stand and make his slow advance on Izzi.  His howling rage was now gone and he advanced slowly on the remaining three members.  Izzi shot a quick but concerned glance at Dreugh and with that look he communicated volumes.  <I>You need to help Goyr, now!</I><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Izzi began to prepare another spell, and Gwynedd was at his side, sword drawn and panting.  &#8220;GO!&#8221; she screamed.  &#8220;I will stay with him.  Go help the Paladin!&#8221;  Her words were urgent, but he knew that she was right.  He could feel Goyr&#8217;s life essence draining from him at this very instant.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow, Dreugh managed to get around the beast and make it to his friends&#8217; side.  He was faced down in a heap of bones, and after careful prodding, Dreugh had found that several bones were broken, including his spine and neck.  That always meant death.  Panic-stricken, Dreugh went against all his medical knowledge and turned his companion over on his back to look into his face.  He called forth the forces of healing that he had used so many times before and poured energy &#8211; a lot of his energy &#8211; into his downed friend.  Goyr convulsed, his body reacting to the healing spell, and many of his visible cuts had healed and most of his broken bones had mended.  He sucked in a ragged breath of air and began breathing, but his strength was very low.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goyr reached up to grab Dreugh&#8217;s tunic in his small, but hairy, fist and he managed to speak.  &#8220;No time&#8230; for that now, Cleric-friend,&#8221; and his eyes fluttered, but he remained conscious.  &#8220;Go help&#8230; Izzi and Gwynedd.&#8221;  His breathing was heavy and labored, and he sounded as if he may not make it still.  Dreugh turned to look at the battle going on.  The other two party members had managed to score many cuts on the legs of the Cyclops, and it was staggering now.  Dreugh saw Izzi&#8217;s hands wave and another blot of energy exploded across the chest of the beast.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one last breath, Goyr stammered, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be&#8230; fine&#8230; go&#8230; help them,&#8221; and he began to cough up some blood.  Dreugh placed his friend&#8217;s head on the ground gently (when did he place it in his hands?) and went to his companions to help finish off the beast.  This would end, now.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreugh picked up his mace and shield and stared up at the now limping Cyclops.  Blood still poured from the open wound on its leg.  It appeared that Goyr might have opened a main artery in the beast&#8217;s leg and he was bleeding to death.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With renewed faith, Dreugh suppressed all of his fears and called upon the forces of Holy Might, a spell known to very few Clerics, but one that would give him enough time to do what he needed.  The spell should stun the Cyclops, as well as do some injury in the process, which should further weaken him.  Dreugh started to draw the power within himself, feel the mana swirl through him, he channeled much more energy into the spell than he normally did, enough to render an Ogre immobile for minutes, and held it with in himself.  He drew upon the power, and focused it at the head of the Cyclops.  It must hit the head, or this will be all for naught.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful blast erupted from him with such fury, he barely contained it, and it struck the Cyclops directly in the head.  The beast shuddered once, and toppled over backwards.  Dreugh managed to stay conscious long enough to see Gwynedd jam her sword deep into the eye of the Cyclops and into its brain.  Dreugh smiled as he felt the life essence drain away from the Cyclops, just before he fell into blackness&#8230;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreugh woke later &#8211; he didn&#8217;t know how much later &#8211; to stare straight up into Gwynedd&#8217;s lovely eyes.  If he didn&#8217;t respect and cherish his friendship with Izzi so much, he may try to steal the lovely Bard from under his nose.  Dreugh smiled as she caressed his cheek and heard her say, &#8220;He&#8217;s awake.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Izzi stood next to her, his face looked sunken in, as if he had been using magic for hours.  His smile said that he was all right, and Dreugh managed to believe that sometimes-deceiving smile.  That&#8217;s when he remembered.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Goyr?&#8221; he managed to choke out.  His throat felt dry like he hadn&#8217;t had a drink in weeks.  Gwynedd handed him a drink, water, to his disappointment, but he still drank all of it greedily and felt his strength returning.  He suddenly noticed he was inside somewhere, but where?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Izzi noticed his puzzled look and said, &#8220;We&#8217;re in Kaladim.  I felt it best for Goyr&#8217;s body to be returned to his family for proper burial.&#8221;  His look was very sad and he noticed a tear forming in his eye.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burial?  Kaladim?  NO!  He was alive.  Dreugh had seen him healed, and he had promised he was okay.  He should have known not to trust the little Dwarf.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;The Healers did all they could, but he did not survive,&#8221; Izzi went on.  &#8220;They&#8217;re a little surprised to see that you did as well.  Said that blast should have killed you.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.  NO!  He can&#8217;t be dead.  He was alive. Dreugh saw it, saw it with his own eyes. And he promised he was all right.  He promised!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Izzi caught the look of confusion in Dreugh&#8217;s face and placed a hand on his shoulder.  &#8220;You did all you could,&#8221; he comforted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did he?  Was there more that he could do?  He had heard the Clerics of higher order speak of the Talent in one to be able to revive the dead, but he never thought it possible.  He had also thought there was no such thing as a Cyclops yesterday, as well.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Take me to him,&#8221; he commanded.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two looked at each other and sighed.  &#8220;Dreugh,&#8221; Izzi started, &#8220;there&#8217;s nothing more you can do.  He is gone from this realm on to the next.  He will be missed by many.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I said take me to him!&#8221;  The snap was a bit more than he expected, but there wasn&#8217;t much time.  He needed to see Goyr fast.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;All right, my friend.  I will take you to him.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They went through a series of corridors in Kaladim.  Dreugh marveled at the inner workings of the Dwarven City.  It looked completely hand carved, intricately designed and fortified.  The Dwarves were reputed stone masons and miners, and the tunnels showed just that.  Izzi and Dreugh had to squat just a little to fit in the tunnels, since they were meant for the height of Dwarves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They came upon an open area where in the middle Dreugh could see many Dwarves huddled around what seemed to be a coffin of sorts.  Goyr was laid out on top, covered in a sheer cloth.  Many of what looked to be family and friends of the Dwarf saw them enter.  Some looked away in shame, others stared straight into his eyes as if to ask, &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you do something?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreugh strode towards the corpse of his friend and was stopped with a stubby, hairy hand in the gut.  &#8220;Who bade ye enter to the sacred ceremony?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreugh looked down into the eyes of what could have been Goyr&#8217;s twin if Goyr were several years older.  A relative perhaps? Maybe his father?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Please,&#8221; he begged with the Dwarf.  &#8220;Please I must help him.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dwarf stared him straight in the face and accused, &#8220;Are ye the one that travels with those who brought me boy back?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father then.  This would be tough.  Dreugh knew Dwarves to be a mostly superstitious lot, feeling no one should tamper with the dead.  They saw it as bordering Necromancy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Please, I must help him.  There isn&#8217;t time for arguing.  Any longer and it could be too late!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Don&#8217;t ya think it is too late enough, Laddie?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Please,&#8221; was all he said in return.  He looked into the eyes of the older Dwarf and tried to convey his true meaning.  He needed to convince him that he was here to help, not to shame or dishonor the family name.  He wanted to help his friend.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Dwarf must have seen something in Dreugh&#8217;s eyes, because his hardened stare softened and looked deep within his soul.  &#8220;All righty, Cleric-friend,&#8221; Dreugh&#8217;s heart tugged at the mention of his familiar name given by Goyr.  &#8220;But be ye warned.  Ye do one thing to defile me boy, and I&#8217;ll tear ya limb from limb meself!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreugh knew he was serious, and his only response was a nod.  The old Dwarf stepped aside and motioned for the others &#8211; who had been watching intently &#8211; to move aside.  They parted and Dreugh stepped through the crowd and up to the pyre that was constructed for his friend.  He barely contained a sob and managed to approach the covered corpse of his friend.  He pulled back the sheer coving and looked at his friend&#8217;s face.  None of that daredevil spirit or the fire of life was anywhere to be found within him, but there was&#8230; something.  He couldn&#8217;t say what, but he had never examined a corpse before, and there was something there that felt as if he could almost see it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Dreugh?&#8221; came the question from Izzi.  The single word spoke countless questions.  But he looked into the face of Wizard he called his friend and gave a look that said, &#8220;I must.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Izzi started to open his mouth, but changed his mind.  Gwynedd was at his side and wrapped her arm around his waist and beckoned him to back away.  A tear dropped from Izzi&#8217;s eye, and just then Dreugh realized what Izzi was so concerned about.  Sometimes he forgot that Goyr and Izzi had known each other from the beginning.  Their adventures had come before Dreugh had joined the group.  Izzi wasn&#8217;t showing concern that he would fail.  He was giving his support to succeed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, Dreugh found himself pushing back his own fears and inhibitions.  He looked deep within the lifeless body of Goyr.  He searched deep within the empty caverns of the Dwarf&#8217;s soul.  He came up on countless dead ends, and seemed as though he would never locate the source of the spark that was slowly fading away.  Panic seeped into his soul again and he closed his eyes.  He breathed in and out, in and out.  He regulated his own heartbeat, slowed it to a more natural pulse from the racing beat it had taken on.  He sought once again into the empty soul that was before him and found that something again, this time it was growing much more faint.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreugh had to act fast.  He wove the colors of life and death in his mind, saw the patterns of the cosmos come to him in his need.  He reached his arms out and threw his head back.  Light cascaded from somewhere above him, he could not tell where.  The heat from the light threatened to burn, and yet protected him from all.  He gathered the power within himself, fed it to the patterns in his mind.  He wove the delicate threads into place and they seemed to fall into place so naturally.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was tired, so very tired.  His ordeal with the Cyclops had left him spent, magically and physically, and he felt the power draining from his body.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Tunare</I>, he thought into the cosmos. <I>Tunare, I beg thee, Mother to All.  Grant me the strength to do what I must! </I><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Dreugh received in response was more than he expected.  The light intensified, and the power rushed into him like a dam being opened.  He had never felt so much power before in his life!  Tunare was with him, granting him the strength and the power as he had asked.  He must not fail now.  He searched with his mind once again deep within the empty shell of his friend and found the almost depleted life spark.  Desperately, he channeled the energy into it.  He focused his entire existence into it. He was the flow, the power.  He needed to save his friend.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After countless moments of time, he felt the spark waver and twitch.  YES!  He thought.  Come on Goyr, you can do it!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was then that he heard the voice in his head.  Whether it was his own, Tunare&#8217;s, or Goyr&#8217;s, he did not know, but the voice responded, No, YOU can do it.  Dreugh continued to feed the power into the web he had woven - continued to feed the now growing spark of energy that was Goyr&#8217;s life force.  He could swear that he felt Goyr twitch in his grasp, (when did he place his head in his hands again?) and opened his eyes to see Goyr&#8217;s fingers twitch, then his leg.  He fed more and more of the power into the spark in his mind, and it glowed so bright that he could barely stand it any more.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreugh fed all the rest of the spell energy into the spark, until it threatened to blind his magical sight, and Goyr sucked in a ragged, but strong gust of air.  He felt, rather than heard the gasps come from the room full of Dwarves watching this display.  He might gasp if he was watching too.  Two, three more breaths, and he started to breath normally.  Goyr&#8217;s eyes opened wide, as if in shock, and he leapt up from the table.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;What in Bloody Hell&#8217;s goin&#8217; on here?&#8221; Goyr questioned wearily, and that was the last thing Dreugh heard before he collapsed into a heap and let the darkness wash over him again.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hours, days, maybe even weeks later - he didn&#8217;t know - he woke again.  It was dark in the room, a small candle lit on the dresser was the only light Dreugh could see, and that was blurry enough.  He tried to wipe the crust from his eyes, and found that his arms were leaden.  He felt as weak as a newborn kitten.  After a few minutes, he managed to wipe away most of the sleep from his eyes, and prop himself up on one arm.  He surveyed the room, and found it to be the same room he was in the first time, only he was alone this time.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere, somehow, he managed to find the strength to sit up and drink from the pitcher on the dresser next to the bed.  More water, (What he wouldn&#8217;t do for good ale right now!) but it helped to subside the massive headache he didn&#8217;t realize he had.  There was also some meat and bread on a plate next to the pitcher, and he managed to eat all of the food before lying back down.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he woke again, (when did he fall asleep?) it was much later.  He could tell because the candle had burned down so low and someone had been in to replace the food and water without rousing him.  He sat up, which was much easier this time, and managed to get dressed and go out of the room.  After stepping out into a well-lit area and being temporarily blinded, he managed to clear his sight and find the room where his friends had been eating dinner.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he entered the room he saw them turn around and bound from the table.  Izzi and Gwynedd reached him first and prodded him with a million questions: Was he all right?  How did he feel?  Will he be able to duplicate the spell?  (That was Izzi.  Always looking to have the impossible.)  And then he heard it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;If you two would kindly step aside and let me Cleric-friend have an ale, we could be over and done with this already!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stepped back to reveal Goyr at the table eating a big plate of some meat and guzzling the biggest tankard of ale he&#8217;d ever seen.  He put the tankard down and let out a satisfying &#8220;aahhhh&#8221; along with a cavern-echoing belch.  &#8220;Well, Dreugh?&#8221; he asked.  &#8220;Ye gonna sit there and gawk, or ye gonna share some of me ale before I finish it all?&#8221;  And then he flashed a yellow-toothed grin so large that Dreugh though he might split his face.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four stood around the table together and toasted to their adventures, and the many more to come.<br>

<P>
	Each day a number of problems found within EverQuest are brought forward in <br>a desperate attempt to catch the eye of Verant's PR people, such as Gordon <br>Wrinn.  And each day, some of these problems are noted and addressed on the <br>various web-boards, /petitioned, or /bugged.  Some times, a misconception is <br>cleared up.  Sometimes, more information is requested.  Sometimes, we, the <br>players, are told that the issue will be fixed shortly.  And sometimes, <br>we're just given the same excuses that we've read so many times; we can <br>recite them from memory.<br><br>	One of the most blatant problems with the excuses I've seen given the <br>players is that Verant lacks the manpower to follow through thoroughly on <br>each change it makes.<br><br>Examples of this:<br><br>1)	Verant has repeatedly asked it's players that if they find a bug, to use <br>the /bug command to report the problem.  Quite often, however, I feel that <br>the bug-logs go unexamined, and are allowed to fill to an overflow such that <br>old items are automatically deleted before they are ever addressed.  I know <br>that a number of issues have been /bugged (as I have done so myself), and <br>rarely have I seen one of these issues that was not addressed through use of <br>web-boards, rather than through examination of the bug-logs.<br><br>2)	Verant has repeatedly asked it's players to use the /feedback command to <br>give their opinion of the game and certain issues that arise.  This would <br>allow Verant to have an inclination how of the players of EverQuest feel.  <br>However, again, I feel that the feedback-logs are allowed to fill to such a <br>capacity that many feedbacks are lost without having ever been examined.<br><br>Indeed, I have often seen GW post about various issues on how he sees the <br>people who post on the web-boards as representing the minority of players.  <br>And yet, he has a very valuable tool in finding the pulse of the majority <br>that he allows to go unused, and wasted.<br><br>3)	Quite often, players have been promised to have an issue looked at either <br>in the immediate future, or by some deadline.  And Verant has quite often, <br>at the last moment, told the players that they have to be more patient, and <br>wait for a further deadline.  Examples of this include Alchemy and Poison.<br><br>4)	Because of the small staff that Verant maintains, they cannot properly <br>play-test things that they put into the game.  This causes repeated changes <br>for something, once it is put in, in order to balance it within the context <br>of the game.  A good example of this is Alchemy, as it has undergone three <br>major forms now (scavenged components, expensive components, and cheap <br>components).<br><br>5)	I have heard, repeatedly stated, that "A number of employees at Verant <br>have characters of level 50 or higher, and thus have an idea and give input <br>for how items go into the game."  I find this very difficult to accept, as I <br>don't think any PC shaman in the game was happy with alchemy not working, <br>nor with either of the first two systems of alchemy that were put into the <br>game.<br><br>Additionally, I saw a post from GW in the previous week where he stated that <br>his level 50+ necromancer has over 40 days played on him.  Now, he's been <br>claiming to have a level 50 necromancer for months now, and if this is true, <br>then he certainly must have had to quit him once he achieved level 50.  My <br>shaman, at level 44, has somewhere in the area of 42 days on him.  <br>Therefore, it is my contention that while many Verant employees may have <br>level 50+ characters&#8230;.they might have not been leveled up in the same manner <br>as the PC's have had to do.<br><br><br>	Another area of great contention and excuse is that of Customer Service.  <br>Here, Verant has brought forth some very flimsy excuses to cover existing <br>problems within their CS program.<br><br>Examples of this:<br><br>1)	Because of the possibility of lying on the part of the Customer, who may <br>indeed have a very legitimate claim, Verant has instructed it's Guides and <br>GM's to automatically assume that the customer is lying UNLESS that customer <br>can prove otherwise.  Their reasoning is that they suspect many people would <br>attempt to get free items or xp-resurrections if they did not take this <br>attitude.  When given the decision between allowing the players to abuse the <br>system (I/e with false claims) or allowing the system to abuse the players <br>(I/e assume they are lying), Verant has chosen the latter course.  And while <br>this may indeed prevent cheating, I am also 100% certain that it will also <br>have the effect of chasing off many more customers than the former route <br>would have caused.<br><br>Also not that many important changes have been put into effect without any <br>attempt made to pole either the players involved, nor the populace in <br>general.  A recent example of this is the changes made to the Antonican <br>Dragons (Vox and Nagafen will teleport anyone of level 53 or greater who <br>engages them<br><br>2)	As noted above, Verant has the perfect way to find how players feel about <br>the game, and yet they don't use it, and simply state that "Only a minority <br>of the players make posts here, and thus are not representative of how the <br>players in general feel about the game."  A major flaw with this is that <br>many players (such as myself) are willing to allow others to speak for us on <br>the web-boards because we feel that we have little to add to their <br>statements.  Quite often, the players posting on the web do represent the <br>feelings of the game.  These are people who have talked to their peers while <br>playing EverQuest, and thus know that they will not offend their compatriots <br>with their postings.<br><br>3)	As noted above, Verant's PR people have made false promises to the <br>players.  In addition to this, there are times when the PR people make <br>strong statements, that the PC's who have wanted the change, assume will go <br>into effect soon.  And thus a promise to examine something with a strong <br>possibility for a change becomes to whichever group is affected, a definite <br>promise of the aforementioned change.<br><br>	What Verant lacks, to me, is communication.  They are in a service where <br>their customer base has wants and needs, and satisfaction is based upon <br>their ability to meet these needs and mitigate the wants in a balanced <br>manner.  By avoided making excuses, looking at a matter in a smart, <br>un-objective manner, and seeing how it would affect their player base as a <br>whole, Verant would have much fewer complaints to deal with, and given <br>enough time, might not even be viewed as the enemy that they are today.<br><br>Graack, Shaman of Xegony<br>"For Halas!  For MacLear!"

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The orcs came just as the rain season began in Faydark.  The blue-skinned creatures had long been residents of the Elven wood, occasionally stirring up trouble around the city of Kelethin, but rarely outside the boundaries of their camp.  The rain, however, drove the orcs to new levels of violence, as if the simplest exploitation of Karana&#8217;s power enflamed Cazic-Thule&#8217;s malice within their twisted souls.  Such outbreaks of violence were quickly stamped out by the Kelethin legionnaires and were rarely much cause for alarm.  This time, however, the rains had come to Faydwer early, just as a legion of the Crushbone Orcs were returning from an excursion along the northern coast.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As usual, the berserk rage poured down upon the orcs as swiftly as the falling rain.  Blinded by this rage, the savage creatures swarmed south in search of their instinctive target &#8211; Kelethin.  But there was a great deal of territory between the coat and the treetop city and the orcs predictably blundered their way into further mischief.  Like a cloud of locusts, the Crushbone Orcs descended into a farmland valley owned by a gentle wood elf named Larwyn Aislein.  <BR><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Daylan Aislein hunkered down low, examining the ground closely where his sharp, sea green eyes had picked out an animal track.  Lowering his face to the spring moss, he took a tentative sniff, causing a lock of auburn hair to fall across his eyes.  Grimacing with annoyance, Daylan flipped the offending lock back, firmly reminding himself that he needed to get it trimmed.  <I>Such things can wait,</I> Daylan conceded, taking another sniff at the minute depression in the moss.  Sure enough, he detected the telltale scent of a wolf.  His father had been right; the packs had returned to take advantage of the hole in the south pasture&#8217;s fence, where they could gain easy access to the chicken pens.  Well, that wouldn&#8217;t last for much longer.  Not only would he patch the fence, but also Daylan intended on making an example of the interloped.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Adjusting his quiver more securely onto his back, Daylan stood and head east in pursuit of the four-legged bandit.  His family had struggled long and hard to establish a foothold in the untamed wilderness of northern Faydwer, and they were not about to let the wilderness take it back.  Not while he was such a skilled archer, at least.  At the thought of his weapon of choice, Daylan raised his right hand to examine the bow his father had presented him two months earlier.  It was only a simple hunting bow, nothing like the elaborate long bow his father had kept from his days as one of Faydark&#8217;s Champions.  Still, it was Daylan&#8217;s most prized possession and he had practiced long and hard with it every day.  Now he could best even his father in an archery match. <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wolf&#8217;s trail was still fresh, indicating that it had only just left the pasture when Daylan had passed on his patrol.  It was also moving in a straight line, so the wolf had no idea it was being tracked.  Daylan wanted it to stay this way, making his job that much easier.  He wetted a finger and raised it to test the wind direction, nodding with satisfaction when he discovered he was downwind from the wolf.  <I>I can smell you, but you won&#8217;t smell me until it&#8217;s too late.  Just the way I like it.</I><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The ground several feet in front of him descended into a shallow chasm were a broad river had once cut across Faydwer from the Ocean of Tears to the Timorous Deep.  The river had long since dried up and the flora had reclaimed its territory, leaving a jagged scar across the eastern coast of Faydwer.  Instinct told Daylan that he should be cautious coming over the rise.  The elevated banks would serve as a blind against the wolf&#8217;s scent and the animal would have the added bonus of being able to see the hunter before he could fire off a shot.  With these thoughts in mind, Daylan lowered himself onto his stomach and slithered up to the crest.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And there it was.  The silver furred wolf was lying in the riverbed, licking its forepaws contentedly.  There was blood on those paws, and Daylan realized that at least one of his father&#8217;s chickens had met its fate at the claws of this savage beast.  He aimed to make certain the wold didn&#8217;t kill again.  Notching an arrow to his bow, Daylan carefully took aim at the beast&#8217;s forehead, aiming slightly above the kill mark between its eyes to compensate for the arrow&#8217;s natural drop.  He breathed a soft prayer to Tunare as he created tension on the string and &#8211; <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wind shifted.  Even as Daylan was muttering an even softer curse, the wolf&#8217;s head shot up.  The young wood elf immediately tensed himself up for the inevitable attack, wondering if he would be able to draw his dagger before the wolf tore out his throat.  Then the smell caressed his nostrils, the foul stench that was overpowering his own scent from the wolf: Smoke.  Something in Faydark was burning, and fire was never a good thing among trees.  The wolf knew it too, and off it pelted, away from the smoke.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the east.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which meant that the fire was in the west.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the direction of Daylan&#8217;s home.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Daylan leapt to his feet and dashed back along the wolf trail, his heart pounding with dread.  The smell of smoke grew stronger as he neared the south pasture, confirming his fears of the worst.  Without slowing, Daylan vaulted over the fence and continued running, his ears detecting the crackle of flames before his eyes saw them.  Daylan came to an abrupt halt, shocked at the sight of his house, consumed in a raging inferno.  The chickens were running amok through the field and from the corner of his eye, Daylan could see the splintered remains of their little house.  But he didn&#8217;t see and sign of the villains who had caused this madness, nor of his family.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;Father!&#8221; Daylan shouted, his gaze darting about the field wildly as he approached the flames apprehensively, afraid he would find his family&#8217;s charred remain near the house.  &#8220;Mother!&#8221;  Thick storm clouds began to fill the mid-afternoon sky, casting a surrealistic pallor over the farm.  A sudden gust of wind blew Daylan&#8217;s rebellious forelock back across his eyes.  The young elf shuddered.  This whole situation seemed bizarre, for Daylan couldn&#8217;t comprehend anyone invoking such a vicious act upon his family.  During his entire life, the only enemies he had encountered had been wolves, who were far from capable of causing this sort of chaos.  His father had not been part of the Champions for over thirty years, and he hadn&#8217;t left any enemies behind in his passing.  He didn&#8217;t think that a complete stranger could so callously destroy all they had struggled to obtain.  &#8220;Father!&#8221; The young elf&#8217;s cries went unanswered, save for a wet snuffling sound, much like that of a pig feeding from a trough.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the perpetrators of this destruction weren&#8217;t harmless pigs.  A hulking creature suddenly materialized aside the burning wreckage, the flames causing its blood red eyes to gleam maliciously.  The creature made its snuffling noise again, which Daylan recognized as its laughter.  The creature was laughing at the outmatched elf that had stumbled into its trap, as blindly as a moth would be drawn into a flame.  Numb with fright, Daylan could only watch the creature&#8217;s advancement, his eyes growing larger as the creature loomed closer, allowing the elf to see the peculiar emblem on the creature&#8217;s gray tunic, the rippling muscles protruding from its blue flesh, and its razor sharp teeth.  It all added up to one possible conclusion : He was going to die, and the creature was going to make his death prolonged and painful.  Daylan squeezed his eyes shut and fervently prayed for Tunare to have mercy on him after the creature ripped him to shreds.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>THWACK!</I><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Daylan&#8217;s eyes sprang open at the familiar sound of an arrow striking home.  The creature stood before him with a barbed arrow jutting from its throat.  Directly behind it stood Daylan&#8217;s father, Larwyn, lowering his longbow to regard his son warmly.  A wicked looking gash dribbled blood into his right eye, but otherwise he seemed to have born the invasion well.  The Elven ranger strode toward his son, giving the slain creature a swift kick in passing, as if to assure himself it was truly dead.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Larwyn strung his bow across his back so he could place both his hands upon Daylan&#8217;s shoulders.  &#8220;Are you all right?&#8221;	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Daylan nodded, his mind whirling with shock. &#8220;I tracked the wolf, but I didn&#8217;t have time to kill it.&#8221;  It seemed like a foolish thing to say in light of the circumstances at hands, but Larwyn nodded with understanding. <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;Another time then,&#8221; he murmured, his quiet voice accentuated by a sudden clap of thunder.  The elf stared up into the overcast sky pensively, then frowned at Daylan.  &#8220;This isn&#8217;t good.  It&#8217;s going to rain.&#8221;	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;Karana is weeping for our tragedy,&#8221; Daylan observed sagely.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;Karana will weep us into our graves!  Run, lad!&#8221;	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Larwyn&#8217;s barked command so startled Daylan that he spun around in confusion.  &#8220;Run?  But to where?&#8221;	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;Anywhere but here!  The orcs will be drawn to this fire like moths once the rain starts to fall!  Hurry, go find your mother!&#8221;	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;Orcs?&#8221; Daylan repeated wonderingly.  His curiosity overrode the urgency of the situation and he gaped down at the corpse.  His father had often entertained him with tales of his deeds as a ranger, back when Faydark&#8217;s Champions had waged war against the twisted spawn of Cazic-Thule, the Lord  of Fear.  It was told that the orcs had a fortress in Faydwer, somewhere along the northern ridge of the Steamfont Mountains.  Twin bonfires, giving it the appearance of an orc awaiting its prey with a gaping maw and burning eyes flanked the entrance to this fortress.  Now that Daylan had finally seen one of the creatures, he was inclined to believe that story, along with all the others that spoke of the orcs&#8217; violent nature.  It was no mystery as to why the orcs would be drawn to the flames; the fire reminded them of the protection offered by their feared stronghold.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;Yes, and from the Crushbone clan as well, though what they&#8217;re doing this far into Faydark is beyond me.  I haven&#8217;t seen their ugly hides since I was a ranger with the Champions.&#8221; <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Daylan inspected the emblem on the orc&#8217;s tunic.  It was a three-clawed hand gripping a femur so tightly that the bone had shattered.  The intricate design bothered Daylan, as it hinted that what he had taken for a mindless creature possessed some disturbing inklings of intelligence.  Then again, perhaps it was only their foul god&#8217;s grip on them that gave the orcs such a manipulative hold on fear. <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;What are you still doing here, Daylan?&#8221; Larwyn suddenly snapped, startling his son.  &#8220;I told you to go find your mother!&#8221;	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Realizing the urgency of the situation, Daylan leapt to his feet.  But before he bolted off, he locked eyes with his father.  &#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221;	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Larwyn readied his bow and regarded his son with a grim expression. &#8220;Take as many of them down as I can.&#8221;  <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Before what?</I> Daylan thought, but he kept silent.  Such a question was not meant to be ventured before a battle, especially one against overwhelming odds.  <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The young elf ran into the north pasture to seek out his mother, notching an arrow to his own bow as he went.  He tried to convince himself that he had done this in order to slay the first orc who crossed his path, but in the end he had to admit his nervousness.  In truth, his small arrows would only serve to annoy the brutes before they ripped his head from his neck.  The entire scene seemed designed to induce paranoia, as well.  The approaching storm had darkened the afternoon sky, leaving the pasture faintly illuminated by the raging inferno of the Aislein home.  This light was marginal, and it was enough to confound Daylan&#8217;s infrared vision, leaving him almost blind as he floundered about the pasture.  The speckles of blood and the crumpled corpse of a lamb gave testament to the orc&#8217;s activity in this sector.  For a moment, Daylan paused and stared into the animal&#8217;s empty eyes, stunned by the savage violence performed upon it.  Its head had been wrenched around to gaze at the elf behind it.  The orcs had even taken the brutal murder a step further, ripping the lamb&#8217;s stomach open and spilling its entrails across the grass.  Pushing his revulsion aside, Daylan stepped over the corpse and continued north.  The firelight elongated his shadow into a surrealistic specter that danced before him in a herky-jerky rhythm. <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His mother&#8217;s vegetable garden seemed more sinister now, though whether that impression was gleaned from his shadow&#8217;s eerie dance across the soil, the oppressive darkness, or the lamb and chicken corpses strewn among the rows of cabbages, Daylan wasn&#8217;t sure.  Vanessa Aislein wasn&#8217;t there, however, though she had left tracks leading away &#8211; <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Daylan paused and squatted to examine the puzzling impressions in the soil, knowing they would reveal the answer to his mother&#8217;s location.  Before a freshly planted row of turnips &#8211; Vanessa&#8217;s current project &#8211; the shallow gouges caused by his mother&#8217;s knees abruptly ended.  Daylan deduced that she had immediately dropped her labor once she had seen the house erupt in flames, just as Daylan had abandoned his hunt when he had smelled the smoke.  Her shallow footprints led towards the house briefly, but then made a sharp turn away, diving into the surrounding forest.  Closely following Vanessa&#8217;s retreat were deeper impressions, a four-clawed mark which Daylan hesitantly identified as an orc print.  Vanessa had been moving fast, her fear giving her flight, but the orc&#8217;s long strides had easily carried him within attacking distance.  There was more blood on the ground just outside the tree line and a peculiar mixture of chicken feathers had fallen amidst the droplets of bright red fluid.  A discarded carcass of the feathers&#8217; owner caused Daylan to form an odd picture in his mind.  Had the malicious Crushbone Orc been hurling <I>chickens</I> at his mother, tearing gashes in her arms?  Daylan considered that to be a pointless exercise and was about to dismiss this absurd possibility &#8211; <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then he saw the other orc tracks, and he realized something new about his enemies : They hunted by the scent of blood and the chicken attacks were driving them into a frenzy.  There were now <I>five</I> sets of orc prints trailing his mother, and the blood was beginning to fall at a more alarming rate.  His heart pounding in his throat, Daylan followed the trail further into Faydark, his infravision slowly returning now that the flames were far behind.  Just as he was began walking beneath the dense foliage, he felt a pitter-patter of rain droplets upon his head.  The onset of the storm caused the young elf to reflect upon his father&#8217;s perplexing words.  He was running out of time.  Once the orcs began to head toward the flames, the trail would become hopelessly muddled, making it impossible for him to track his mother.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just then, a familiar snuffling sound attracted his attention.  Withholding the urge to panic, Daylan dove into a nearby bush, holding perfectly still to camouflage his presence.  As soon as he was settled, the five orcs came lumbering out of the trees, snorting and pounding one another upon the back, congratulating each other on some marvelous deed.  Their blood red eyes were glowing wit a malicious form of energy and Daylan shuddered unconsciously wen an orc glowered in his direction.  He had a new reason to fear these grotesque creatures now.  He had been disgusted by their actions earlier, just as he would have been had he stumbled upon the carnage left by a pack of wolves.  But now that he saw that they were sentient creatures, he was filled with rage.  Not only did they realize they were committing heinous crimes against the peaceful farmers, but they were actually enjoying it!  Yet, even this newest realization didn&#8217;t prepare him for the orc&#8217;s reaction when they emerged from the thick canopy and felt the rain beating down upon them.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The orcs went berserk.  As one, the foul creatures raised their faces to the sky and began to howl.  It was a cry of defiance raised towards Karana for sending the offensive precipitation.  Their battle cry sounded, the pack darted out into the downpour, heading directly towards the still-burning farmhouse.  For a brief instant, Daylan considered unloading his arrow into one of the orcs&#8217; backs to distract them from his father, but he decided it would be unwise to incur the wrath of the Crushbone pack.  He was not particularly proud of his decision since in emphasized his terror of the orcs, but he firmly reminded himself that his father was a ranger.  Larwyn could take care of himself without his son running the risk of getting killed.  Besides, Daylan had his own assignment, though he had a dreadful suspicion as to what he would find in the depths of Faydark.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The rain could not penetrate the thick canopy, but the rhythmic drumming high above enhanced the eerie feeling within Daylan&#8217;s spirit.  He separated himself from the surrounding foliage and cautiously maneuvered over the where the orcs had come from, fearful that the slightest noise would bring a horde of orcs crashing down upon him.  Despite his caution, it only took a few seconds for him to backtrack the orcs&#8217; trail and discoverer the scene of horror they had left behind.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vanessa Aislein was nailed into the bark of a wide oak tree, her arms and legs splayed like a fur hanging on a wall.  Her mouth was gaping open, forever frozen in the scream of terror she had emitted before the orcs had administered their final torture.  They had casually slit her open from navel to throat and emptied her intestines upon the ground.  The organs had then been trampled, possibly while their screaming owner watched helplessly.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Daylan stared at the scene before him in hopeless horror for a long moment.  Then, slowly, steadily, his disbelief gave way to a raw, unharnessed rage.  His vision dulled into a red-tinted landscape and an animal growl emerged from his throat as he whirled around to track his foes.  He had no more fear for the sick, twisted monsters who had done this, only an urge to find them and tear them apart as callously as they had done his mother.  The rage was far beyond anything he had ever felt towards the vermin who had harassed their farm.  There was no animal instinct involved in his mother&#8217;s death, only a lust for cruelty.  Daylan wanted to give them their cruelty back, in full.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;Mother Tunare,&#8221; he snarled devoutly, &#8220;forgive me for this anger, but give me strength to vanquish these murderers!&#8221;	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In response, the sky flashed and rumbled as the storm broke over the farm.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though he knew the orcs had gained a substantial lead on him, Daylan managed to catch up with the monsters.  The five orcs were still charging towards the fire, their eyes intent on Larwyn taking aim before them, heedless of the danger approaching from behind.  Suddenly, one of the orcs grunted and stumbled, an arrow protruding from its shoulder blades.  The arrows were designed to take down small woodland creatures, not thick-boned monsters, so the orc was considerably more surprised than injured.  While the other four continued their relentless charge, the marked orc paused to dislodge the arrow from its back.  As a result, it was standing perfectly still when Daylan delivered a flying kick, driving the arrow deep into the orc&#8217;s spine and shoving the monster onto its face.  Now that injury had been added to insult, the Crushbone Orc clambered to his feet, eager to break the annoying wood elf in two.  <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the burly orc was no match for Daylan&#8217;s fury.  Before the startled monster could launch an attack of its own, Daylan slammed a right cross into its bony jaw, shattering it.  A kick to the stomach doubled the monster over, allowing Daylan to bring his joined hands down upon its neck and, as the orc fell, drive a knee into its face, shoving its snout back into its brain.  The orc flopped to the ground and died with a groan.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By now, the other four had realized that something had gone horribly wrong, but it was far too late to stop their charge now as they were in range of Larwyn&#8217;s longbow.  An arrow in its right eye promptly dropped the lead orc, while the second took the point right in its skull.  The last two seemed hesitant to continue up the hill towards the master archer, but they were just as reluctant to face the raging elf behind them.  But the rain continued to fall, overriding their life-preserving thoughts of surrender.  Of the two left, the bulkier orc whirled around and charged towards Daylan.  Larwyn&#8217;s hastily fired arrow bounced harmlessly off the thick armor concealed beneath the remaining orc&#8217;s tunic and the monster quickly closed the distance between them.  Unimpressed, Larwyn drew his short sword and ran the monster through.  As for the other, once it was in range, Daylan punched it in the throat.  The blow collapsed the orc&#8217;s windpipe, reducing the orc to a whimpering, choking beast.  It writhed on the ground in agony, tears forming at the corners of its red eyes.  Then it lay still, dead.  <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Larwyn&#8217;s orc slid off the steel blade and plopped on the ground, its eyes scowling at the gaping wound in its chest.  Larwyn leveled his sword at the orc&#8217;s throat. &#8220;Why?&#8221; the elf demanded. &#8220;Why did you do this?&#8221;	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The orc&#8217;s eyes rolled back into its head and its skull cracked against the ground.  &#8220;Hail Emperor Crush,&#8221; it muttered in a gravelly voice.  And then it died.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Larwyn shook his head and knelt beside the corpse, wiping his blade on its tunic.  When the sword was clean, he looked up at Daylan, squinting his eyes to see his son through the rain.  &#8220;Vanessa&#8217;s dead, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221;	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The thunder rumbled as Daylan nodded grimly. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a very pretty sight.&#8221; <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;Orc mutilations rarely are,&#8221; the elf murmured, closing his eyes to ward off the pain. &#8220;I tried to spare her this.  That&#8217;s why I resigned from Faydark&#8217;s Champions so long ago.&#8221; <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;This atrocity can not be allowed to pass without retaliation!&#8221; Daylan cried, crossing to where his father knelt.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Larwyn regarded him evenly. &#8220;And what would you suggest we do about the Crushbone Orcs to repay them?&#8221;  <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;Destroy them!&#8221; Daylan snarled vengefully. &#8220;Find this Emperor Crush and slay him for his vile nature!&#8221;	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;That&#8217;s not a wise idea, Daylan.  Not even the entire legion of Faydark&#8217;s Champions were to assault the Crushbone fortress.  I doubt the two of us would stand much of a chance.  Besides. . . I can&#8217;t go with you.&#8221;	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;What?  Why not?&#8221; <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Larwyn shook his head, saddened by Daylan&#8217;s brashness, a tragic circumstance caused by his youthfulness. &#8220;My life is <I>here</I>, Daylan,&#8221; he explained patiently. &#8220;I&#8217;ve passed my fifth century, and I&#8217;m too old to go adventuring through Faydwer again.  I&#8217;m too old to even start my life over.  I&#8217;m far too old to wage war against Crushbone.&#8221;	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;Then I&#8217;ll go alone!&#8221;	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;And get killed without doing any significant damage to the orc population.  You handled those two fairly easily, but you had the element of surprise of your side and that berserk rage of yours can&#8217;t last forever.&#8221;	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Daylan opened his mouth to argue, but he had to admit that he felt weary now that the battle was over.  A grim picture flashed into his mind, one in which he was slumped to the ground, exhausted after an intense battle in the orc camp, only to have twelve more swarm over him and systematically beat him into the ground.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;Then there&#8217;s nothing we can do,&#8221; Daylan concluded glumly.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;Now I didn&#8217;t say that, Daylan.  There&#8217;s always something you can do.&#8221;  Larwyn rose from the ground and walked over to the burning remains of their home.  Though the rain was still falling, the fire was still raging. &#8220;The Crushbone Orcs are like this fire, son.  It has been burning for so long and so hot that a simple rain shower can not put it out.&#8221;  He smiled at Daylan. &#8220;On your own, son, you would only be a light drizzle upon the orcs&#8217; blaze.  You either need to find more water or &#8211;&#8221; Larwyn raised his hand and stretched it towards the flames. &#8220;&#8211; or become a more effective extinguisher.&#8221; <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Daylan felt the hair on the back of his neck rise as a peculiar tingling washed over him.  A soft rumbling began beneath his feet, closely followed by a minute eruption from behind the house.  As Daylan watched in shock, a patch of earth rose up and flopped over the house, extinguishing the flames in a heartbeat.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;How. . ?&#8221; Daylan began, but his voice trailed off when his father pivoted to face him.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;You will journey south, to Kelethin.  You will join Faydark&#8217;s Champions and become a ranger.  You will become one with nature and learn how to employ it in your fight against Crushbone.&#8221;	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;Kelethin?  But I&#8217;ve never &#8211;&#8221;  <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;Seek out Eldin Trueshot.  He is the leader of Faydark&#8217;s Champions and an old friend of mine.  He will welcome you into the guild and train you as if you were his own son.&#8221; <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;Yes, Father,&#8221; Daylan agreed reluctantly, bowing his head in submission. &#8220;I&#8217;m ready to go.&#8221; <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;Then go.  Follow the road to Kelethin, and follow your heart beyond.&#8221; <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This last bit of wisdom imparted, Larwyn sank to the ground to watch the cooling embers.  Daylan stood there a moment longer, searching for something to tell his defeated father.  Discovering nothing but a profound heartache, the young wood elf sighed heavily and set out for Kelethin, in the southern edge of the Greater Faydark.	<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Daylan Aislein was only nineteen years old.

From the responses to the last editorial, I can see that there is a great<br>deal of interest in this particular topic.  I think a couple of points<br>needs to be elaborated, however, so I am taking another stab at this.<br><br>Granted, not having a base of operations on a harsh continent like Kunark<br>must really make some players angry, especially after working through a<br>long dungeon crawl only to return to a city in which you formerly had<br>favored citizen status and end up slaughtered.  It would make me angry.  On<br>the other hand, much of EQ is trial by fire, and it's meant to be that way.<br> <br><br>Faction was put in the game to add an element hard to find in online games<br>- a complex system of cause and effect to take the game to a different<br>level.  In the case of the Kunark factions for evil races, you have to make<br>a choice, and that choice is which of the options appeals most - the fort<br>or the dungeon?  For those who have chosen the dungeon and have no place to<br>sell or rest, that's what wizard teleports are for, so you can get back to<br>the mainland and take care of business.<br><br>I am sure that some will now argue how they should not have to rely on<br>another class to simply buy or sell.  In truth, however, that's part of why<br>we choose classes.  We do have to rely on the other classes in situations<br>where we cannot take care of a specific situation ourselves.<br><br>I believe in the character development facet of of EQ - however, I don't<br>believe you have to have access to every area of the game.  That's why you<br>choose evil or good races, specific classes and make faction decisions. <br>That sets EQ apart from the normal online games.<br><br>Oakgrove Fallingleaf

<P>
Today I received an Email from God.  Yes, the one and only Himself, God.  I<br>would greatly appreciate if you posted this on the main page of your site in<br>order to spread the word to all fellow gamers. With no further delay, I<br>present to you his Email to me.<br><br><BLOCKQUOTE><i>Dear Survivor(tm):<br><br>We here at Eternal Software in partnership with Heaven Productions have<br>brought to you the MMORPG known as Life for the past million years.  Life has developed at a fantastic pace, and the extensive Beta Test has gone incredibly well.  Each Beta Tester has been crucial to the development of Life.  While ups and downs have occurred, we feel that Life would not be where it is today without them.  Make no mistake, we understand that Life still has many bugs, and while they seem to be occurring on a daily basis, we have come to the conclusion that Life is not perfect.<br><br>Recently their have been rumors about Life being closed down due to lack of<br>funding and motivation.  "The Apocalypse" as it's become known by the<br>underground of the gaming community.  We assure you, this is not the case.<br>Life will continue.  On that note, I, God, bring you great news:<br><br>Life will be going Gold!  That's right, the long-awaited Full-Release of<br>Life<br>is upon us!<br><br>Life will go from a free Beta Test to a monthly fee.  While Life has no real<br>competition in its genre, we wanted to continue with the industry trend.  An<br>hourly charge was tossed around, but we've decided that in order to<br>participate in Life, beginning July 1st, each player will need to pay $9.95<br>(US Currency) per month.  This, to us, is more than fair.  We hope all who<br>stuck with us through the Beta Test will continue to participate in Life<br>Gold.<br><br>Life Gold will require NO Software!  It is completely downloadable!<br><br>Life will also open with one server to inhabit all players.  Other servers<br>will be opened depending on population boosts.  Also, as always, exploration<br>onto other Servers will occur.  Earth will remain the main server.  The Moon<br>was explored, but did not seem fitting.  Next we will attempt to open the<br>Mars Server.  (Please note that any characters made on any other server but<br>Mars will be considered to be playing on a Test Server, and may be wiped at<br>any time.)<br><br>Features in Life!<br><br>Full Player-Killing!  (We will leave it to the Morals of our players to<br>define when to and when to not PK.  While PK-Free Zones will exist, they are<br>only located in areas where the tax-bracket is above the 95% percentile.)<br><br>Countless Professions!  (All professions in Life will have a crucial effect<br>on Society! [this is however not guaranteed if you are required to wear your<br>name on your shirt in order to work])<br><br>Multiple Races!  (While some balance issues remain between the races, our<br>Head Race Guru Tiger Woods is hard at work on the issue.)<br><br>Weapons! Weapons! Weapons!  (Life will ship with a nearly unlimited supply<br>of<br>combat-oriented weapon choices!  *UPDATE*  Just Added:  Nuclear Weapons<br>[These may only be bought by those who dedicate enough time to Life to get<br>into positions of power, or by the extremely wealthy who have ties to the<br>Russian Black Market])<br><br>Skill-Based Advancement System!  (Combat is -not- required to advance in<br>Life! [unless your character happens to be born with a redneck.  Then,<br>unfortunately, a bug is apparent in the system that requires you to own a<br>shotgun and enjoy hunting])<br><br>A completely functional herbal subsystem!  (Leisure or Medical uses to be<br>discovered by the players.)<br><br>A fully operational Ecosystem!  (Tornados, Earthquakes, Floods, Natural<br>Disasters, oh my!)<br><br>NO Game Masters!  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, Life will be<br>completely<br>Game Master free.<br><br>NO Customer Support!  We here at Life feel it is up to our players to aid<br>each other.<br><br>NO Downtime Servers!  Life will have absolutely NO down time!<br><br>Eating and Sleeping are required to survive in Life.  (We felt that some<br>sort<br>of realism was crucial to be able to "be" the role, not just "play" the<br>role.<br> However, some players have been known to eventually become immune to<br>sleeping and avoid it all-together.  We do not recommend this practice.)<br><br>Life will be a Rant-Free Game!  That's right, you can rant all you want<br>about<br>Life, for absolutely NO EXTRA CHARGE!<br><br>Life will be UPDATED DAILY!   A new patch will be introduced EVERY SINGLE<br>DAY!  (However, if you live in the Midwest United States, we cannot<br>guarantee<br>much change in Life.)<br><br>The Prison System in Life is still flawed, however, rest assured that Trolls<br>will all be dealt with accordingly.<br><br>We will be releasing a patch BEFORE Life ships in order to BETTER your<br>playing experience.<br><br>Finally, Life will contain NO NERFS!  If you are born with crummy luck, WE<br>WILL NOT MAKE YOUR LIFE WORSE!  The Rich will ALWAYS remain Rich in Life!<br><br>If you have any further questions regarding Life (Or if you'd like to bug us<br>in general, give him a job in the Gaming Industry, or Host a Column/Site for<br>him) please Email SavantKnowsAll@cs.com.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>God</BLOCKQUOTE></I>

Dartain we have <br>the resources to make our own assumptions and conclusions. There is no need <br>to bring outsiders into the matter!

<P>
One very fascinating aspect about writing opinionated editorials such as this one is the amazingly broad spectrum of responses you get from the readership.  One person can read an article about fly fishing and walk away thinking it was about how to tie bait to a hook, while another person can read the same piece and walk away thinking it was about boat and water safety as you fish on a lake.  While both may be essentially correct, neither is accurate.<P>Similarly, some people can read an editorial about customer service at Verant and walk away thinking it was nothing more than a well-phrased justification for poor quality, while other people can read the same editorial and walk away thinking it was a flame on Verant's inability to live up to unreasonable expectations.  I received responses from readers who were convinced I was squarely on "Verant's side," and others who saw my editorial as a blatant attack on Verant.  It just goes to show how true the old axiom is that says people will see what they want to see.  <P>(As evidence of this, I even received one very amusing letter from an individual who accused me of being Abashi himself.  I'm sorry, but the patience of Job is not a virtue I possess.  If I had Abashi's job, I'd probably be fired within a cool 24 hours.)<P>The truth is, I'm not on anybody's side.  The Bottom Line details the situation as I see it, and that's the long and the short of it.  There were some points that cut Verant several yards of slack and other points that left no room for excuses.  Like most things, it's not a black and white issue.<P>As usual, such circumstances inspire some very contemplative individuals to voice their own take on the matter.  Beyond the very positive comments I received in the message board thread (thanks a bunch to everyone who posted!), I did receive two e-mail responses I felt warranted some comment.  Both are well-written and made for enjoyable reading.<P>Our first one is from a gentleman named Fred who thought it proper to defend Verant against some of the more negative points...<P>----------<P><FONT COLOR="0000AA">You have no idea what it's like running a company that has to deal with the public <BR>at large. When 99.5% of your customers are satisfied. Unfortunately, it's the .5% <BR> that are the vocal minority. They are the ones who post on all the boards, whining <BR> because "it's unfair." And as in real life, it's always the outspoken minority who is <BR>heard, and not the satisfied majority.</FONT><P>Of that, I have no doubt.  However, don't presume I have no idea what it's like running such an institution.  I worked as one of six (yes, <U>six</U>) technical support representatives at a multi-national software development company whose latest product release was ungodly at best, and 99.5% of the customers were irate.  Can we say "Class Action Lawsuit?"  I think we can...<P><I>"And thank you so much for bringing up such unpleasant memories.  While <BR>you're at it, why don't you give me a paper cut and pour lemon juice on it?"</I><P>- Miracle Max, The Princess Bride<P><FONT COLOR="0000AA">I laugh when people say that Verant "doesn't care about their customers." To <BR>believe that is foolish and naive. Everything that they do is geared towards making <BR>the MAJORITY of the customers happy. You can't please everyone when there <BR>are 250,000 people involved in the same small universe. <P></FONT>I'm glad you concur with at least one point from the article.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>And no one, no one, I don't care if you run one of the main EQ webpages, has an <BR>ear to even 1% of the customer base. <P>I sympathize with Verant. It's people like yourself and those silly board posters <BR>who bitch and moan and attack the company that are the root of the most of the <BR> dissatisfaction. When you take your visible position and attack something, people <BR>automatically think that you are right, and Verant is completely out to "screw" <BR>people.<P></FONT>Me?   What did I do?  I pointed out several key issues that have been the subject of player ranting of late - leaving many unmentioned, by the way.  I never said that I agreed with them or endorsed player arguments.  In fact, I defended Verant's seemingly callous attitude, citing the very same reasons you mentioned above where you shared with us what makes you laugh.  <FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>Of course, you realize that with 250,000 people subscribewd, they can't just <BR>arbitraily make changes to the fundamental game. They have to carefully weigh <BR>what they do. Fact: every time they adjust something, something else in the game <BR>goes wrong. There is an awful lot that is interdependant. They can't just rush in <BR>and change something without careful planning and testing. And just imagine how <BR>long their list of "fine-tuning is." It must be immense. And every siungle issue <BR>must be addressed in regards to class and game balance, and even how it will <BR>affect the underlying code. <P></FONT>I agree.  Such matters should be addressed with care and foresight.  To do otherwise is reckless and invites no end of trouble.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>And, if someone whines loud enough, and they do respond by saying something <BR>like, "it's on the table," everyone assumes that it will be ready tommorrow, and <BR>when it's not, they holler louder, that "Verant is out to screw them again." I can't <BR>imagine having Gordon or Brad's job. Protected by the anonymity of the internet <BR>makes people truly rotten. If a customer acted liek that in real life to a company <BR>rep, the company would simply stop doing business with them. <P></FONT>It depends on the company.  Such generalizations are rarely true.<P>You're right about one thing, though.  The relative safety of the Internet does open the door to see people at their worst.  I sometimes wonder what would happen if half the things said in my reader response e-mails were spoken to me face-to-face.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>And regarding the test server. It is unfortunate that the characters were wiped. Yes, <BR>it stated that at the OPENING page of the server, but still, these people contributed <BR>their time to test bugs and improvements/patches for everyone else, especially the<BR>whiners. I'd put good money that the majority of the players on the test server were <BR>altrusistic and intelligent. That being said, I agree that it may have been a little <BR>extreme "wiping the characters," but it doesn seem like Verant is retracting that <BR>stance and at least reinstating the players if not the items. Lesson learned, <BR>problem solved.<P></FONT>The Test Server is an island unto itself, both in playing EverQuest and in its administration.  I, too, am ranked among those players who were hit by the item wipe, but at least I knew the score when I created those characters.  There were many players (particularly since the opening of Kunark) who were not entirely aware of the situation on Test, and were consequently caught flat-footed when they discovered the truth of things.  Whether or not it was their own fault, it's still regrettable.  Personally, I think mistakes were made on both sides of this issue.  <FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>In conclusion, no one, not the webpages, nor Verant themselves, makes anyone <BR>play/buy Everquest. It's a product like anything else. If people are dissatisfied, then <BR>they are welcome to stop paying $9.89 a month, and move on. But I personally get<BR>exasperated when I hear or read reactionary, inflammatory material. People never <BR>see the forest for the trees in this case. <P></FONT>What you call inflammatory, many people call constructive criticism.  You seem to resent my latest contribution to the EverQuest community, but going over it, I find nothing that could be seen as anything but forthright and patently honest.  My candor may collide with your own opinion, but like Verant, I'm not out to satisfy the outspoken minority.<P>I'm not even out to satisfy the silent majority, for that matter...<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>&lt;sigh&gt; Anyway, I am a satisfied customer. I play EQ as a light hobby, and <BR>have a very good job, a great life, a wife, and a hopping social life. Maybe that <BR>gives me a different perspective than much of the customer base. Or, perhaps that <BR>is inaccurate. A better perspective than the WHINING customer base, as I in no <BR>way shape or form am privvy to the thoughts and feelings of a quarter million <BR>people. Oh wait- but then how are those handful of professional complainers any <BR>more knowledgable than me?<BR>Hmmm.....  <P></FONT>That's not for me to say, but reducing "much of the customer base" to a group of whining, social recluses is not a good way of getting your point across.  People complain when something contrary to their enlightened self-interest takes place - it has always been that way, and it always will be.  Validity takes a backstage stance to all else under such conditions where people have free reign to speak their minds.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>For the record, Shadoe, please don't see this as ire directed completely at you. You <BR>are just as entitled to your feelings as I am. <BR><P></FONT>Why, thank you.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>Oh yeah, re: "capitalism at iits finest." Capitalism is competition in a free market <BR>place. Verant "not caring" is not "capitalism at its finest." Capitalism at its finest <BR>would be several companies like Verant competing for the same consumer dollar. <BR>The only other kid on the block right now is Ultima Online, which isn't really <BR>competiton in the sense that it's not as active a member in the "MMRPG" <BR>community anymore. You're talking about a "monopoly." <P></FONT>One... I never said Verant didn't care.  On the contrary, I said they <I>do</I> care about their players as a community, <I>questioning</I> whether they cared for them as individuals, or even if they should.<P>Two... When did I say Verant not caring would be capitalism at its finest?  For those like you who missed it, I'll summarize: It's the freedom of the consumer to cancel his (or her) account that is capitalism at its finest.  It's increased competition that will make the bottom line serve the online gamer.  I suggest reading that part again, sir, because I simply can't fathom how any other message could come out of those two paragraphs.<P>And, no, Verant does not hold a monopoly.  The market is just very narrow at the moment.  Besides, this is <I>entertainment</I>.  People will pay for it so long as it serves their purposes to do so.  This being the case, a monopoly in this regard would really be bordering on futility.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>Anyway, I appreciate and respect the fact that you aren't afraid to express your <BR>opinions Shadoe. <P> See you around, <BR>Fred</FONT><P>----------<P>Great Marr in a bottle... If I were shy about expressing my opinions, I'd have no right being a columnist.  Thanks for sharing your point of view, Fred!<P>Moving on to our second reader response, we'll take a closer look at a couple of the more specific issues I mentioned in the article...<P>----------<P><FONT COLOR="0000AA">Shadoe,<P>Excellent article.  I know I haven't been playing as long as you have, but<BR>I've seen the number of complaints increase in the few months that I've been<BR>here.  You can't deny it either; it really affects your opinion of the game.<BR>Even though many of these complaints are unfounded, it really skews your<BR>impression after enough time reading them.  The best thing I've done lately<BR>with regard to EQ is deciding to stop reading the message boards.  Sure, there<BR>are several valid complaints on the boards, but they're buried beneath<BR>thousands of whines and rants and *bump*s.  The sheer amounts of name <BR>calling and personal attacks on the official board makes me sick...but I digress.<P>Everquest has its problems.  It has bugs, and it will always have bugs.  It's<BR>a computer game.  Vampire will have bugs, and so will Neverwinter Nights.<BR><P></FONT>Eh, bugs are bugs.  No matter how we try to disavow such things, computers will always be riddled with them.  The real question is, will the bugs in Vampire and NeverWinter be duly fixed as they arise, or will it follow the same path Origin and Verant have adhered to in the past?... "We don't have time to fix this bug, so anyone found exploiting it will be banned."  Of course, with DMs in charge of their respective worlds, that complicates matters a bit.<P>(Okay, so it's a non-issue.  Sue me!)<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>Now, I'm not saying that that's fine; not by any means.  Verant does seem to<BR>have a nack for creating more problems than they fix.  Everquest's biggest<BR>problem, though, is it's player base.  There are 250,000 people here, and 90%<BR>of them expect preferential treatment.  It's just not goint to happen.<BR>There's no way it /can/ happen.  But people complain anyway.  And complain,<BR>and complain, and complain.<P>One problem that I really have is the complaints about Verant's 'Vision(tm)'.<BR>It rears it's ugly head in every complaint.  But I, for one, am glad that<BR>Verant has a vision of the game.  How is this any different than having a DM<BR>with a set of rules for your pen and paper campaign?  <P></FONT>It's different in the sense that a Dungeon Master's game session is a privatized arena.  I've been playing pencil and paper roleplaying games since childhood, and I've yet to see a DM charge his players admission (though I've heard about the unusual, tournament-style occasions that could technically serve as exceptions).  Quite literally, if a DM laid down a set of ground rules the players didn't like (or worse, <I>changed </I>the rules when they became inconvenient), he'd be playing the game alone.  Though commercially the same rules do apply, it's really an apples-to-oranges comparison when measured against massively multiplayer gaming.  Verant is a multimillion dollar company; Dungeon Masters are a dime a dozen.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>Their vision dictates virtually every aspect of the game, which is /definitely/ a <BR>good thing.  Imagine the complaints if Verant hadn't given thought to their <BR>perception of their game?  Their 'Vision(tm)' is a good thing, as it allows for some<BR>understanding on their stance on many issues.<P></FONT>Allow me to play devil's advocate here, and argue the point that if Verant's Vision(tm) were as you say, then there would be nothing to take issue with.  Normally such a vision is defined in a few simple, definitive sentences.  Yet Verant has as much as admitted that their Vision(tm) is a conglomerate of mixed opinions of their team.  Such a nebulous definition leads into territories that smack to me as being greatly hypothetical in nature.  When you take any kind of foundational meaning out of your vision, what's left but a device that you can dig up every time you make an administrative judgment call?  Basically what such a vision says is "We'll do what we think is best at any and all times, end of story."<P>While that may be a valid statement when it comes to Verant's liberties with their product, it certainly isn't visionary.  I contend that Verant, in fact, has no substantial vision beyond that of their quaintly trademarked title.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>Dont' get me wrong, I don't necessarily like the idea of paying a monthly fee<BR>to have someone tell me how the game is supposed to be played.  But it /is/<BR>their game.  If I don't like that fact, I am free to cancel my account at any<BR>time.  But, quite honestly, I don't mind it.  (And I for one would /hate/ to<BR>go to the Bahamas, but that's another story. :)  I certainly enjoy the<BR>prospect of Neverwinter Nights.  Vampire doesn't appeal to me because of the<BR>setting, but Neverwinter Nights is definitely something that I'm going to look<BR>into.  In fact, I'd love to see what you could do with a NWN server.<BR><P></FONT>As would I.  It has incredible potential.  We'll see if the folks at Bioware have what it takes to pull it off.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>I agree with you about the roleplaying.  I've only been playing for a few<BR>months, but I know I wouldn't be here any more if I hadn't been roleplaying my<BR>characters.  Fighting in Everquest is /boring/ to me, and I don't see how<BR>others could do nothing but fight.  But that's my opinion, and I'm entitled to<BR>think that way.  If you want to do nothing but fight, then you are definitely<BR>free to do so, just as I'm entitled to sit around in a bar with my goblet of<BR>wine.<P>Anyway, this email has become long-winded.  Again, great article.  It's always<BR>good to step back and look at these issues from a broader perspective.  It's<BR>just unfortunate that a large percentage of the player base seems to be unable<BR>to do the same.<P>Tween</FONT><P>----------<P>Though marginal to the topic at large, I have been looking for an excuse to voice my opinions along those lines.  Thanks for giving me the opportunity, Tween!<P>That about sums it up for this edition of Shadoe's Corner.  Thanks again to all who read the article, and my gratitude to those who took the time to comment!<P>- &lt;Shadoe&gt;

<P>
It seems to me that lately there has been so much more angst over EverQuest by the player base at large.  There seems to be a lot more people griping about something-or-other that happens to be wrong with the game who are no longer content with merely threatening to cancel their EQ accounts, but who actually <I>are</I> leaving the game purportedly forever.  Issues such as guide/GM abuse, Verant's elusive and indefinable Vision(tm) that's more a vehicle of convenience for them than anything, the ever-mutating game mechanics that are altered at the drop of a hat in the name of an "evolving world," player/item wipes taking place on the Test Server, sporadic (but no less frustrating) bugs that Verant tends to hold in skepticism until enough players complain that it becomes unavoidable months later, innumerable broken quests that make you spend hours of your time to complete only to be snuffed in the end, patches that seemingly break more things than they repair, uber-guilds who monopolize adventure areas in clear defiance of the loudly touted (but often unenforceable) Play Nice Policies... need I go on?<P>In short, the players are forming the impression that Verant Interactive doesn't care about them.  Rightly or wrongly, and for some unfathomable reason, Verant has allowed themselves to be viewed as "the Enemy" by a great number of players who try so desperately hard to enjoy their product.  And let's not mince words here, even irate players who leave the game in a huff <I>want</I> to enjoy EverQuest.  It's a disappointment for both parties when a player decides that ten dollars per month is too much to pay for the alleged "hassle" of adventuring in Norrath.  Not only is Verant out one more monthly payment, but the player is also bereft of something they were once very enthusiastic about.<P>On one side of the equation, it is something Verant has had to form a necessarily thick skin over.  You can't please all of the people all of the time, and that holds absurdly true when catering to an active player base in excess of 250,000 people.  On the other side of the equation, we have a very disgruntled person who sees Verant Interactive as the collective Anti-Christ of the twenty-first century.<P>The truth of that standpoint is subjective.  It makes no sense that a company whose life's blood flows from its customers (is there any other kind of company?) would so callously hold them in the same regard as sheep.  A spurned customer base is a short-lived customer base, and hence the same can be said for the business.  So, I think it's safe to say that Verant, in fact, <I>does</I> care for its players as a community.  Which begs the residual question: Do they care for their players as individuals?  Should they?<P>At ten dollars a month, is one individual's enjoyment of the game worthy of attention?  The bottom line says that a dissatisfied player has one of two choices - to leave the game or to stay.  If they decide to stay, then so much the better - whether or not they're enjoying themselves to the fullest potential is irrelevant.  If they decide to leave, then it's a loss of ten out of over two-and-a-half million dollars revenue per month.  When faced with those numbers, what would your answer be?<P>Speaking candidly, my answer would be to sell out and take one month's income with me to the Bahamas where I can live the rest of my natural life lying in the sun on a warm beach sipping pina coladas.  No, I'm not proud of that, but there you go.  I also know I wouldn't be lonely on that beach if every other EQ player had the same option.<P>If you can honestly say otherwise, then I invite you to cast the first stone.  My personal opinion is that there is no mortal alive on this planet who could possibly care for a quarter of a million individuals, making sure each and every player is happy and content in the trouble-free, paradisiacal dream world we all wish Norrath could be.  Adding the numbers into the mix, I doubt many would feel motivated to try.<P>So what happens?  Players feel put upon.  Players feel abandoned for the ten dollars they cough up every month.  Players become embittered when told that's all their opinions are worth, and many leave the game because of it, defying the 249,999 people remaining to follow suit.  Capitalism at its finest.<P>But what happens when you're sitting on what is widely considered to be the best massively multiplayer game in town?  (Albeit arguably.)  With slim pickings as to where to go, a great deal of players will choose to remain until something better comes along.  People start to think that, considering their limited options, maybe things aren't so bad after all.  At least, this is what they think until the next game is introduced, making the current game look like an incarnation of massively multiplayer Pong.  Again, capitalism at its finest.<P>People said the same thing about Ultima Online before it had any competition.  I know - I was one of them.  I also think that EverQuest is a far superior game to Ultima Online, cited problems and all.  Has it hurt Origin Systems that every month over 250,000 people pay Verant Interactive ten dollars to agree with me?  <P>I may read their signals wrong, but Origin doesn't seem too worried.  They don't seem even the slightest bit uncomfortable.  The massively multiplayer market has been growing beyond all belief.  Quite simply, there's financial room in the playground for more game companies to play - a <I>lot</I> more.<P>It will take time for the market to veer off and level out, my friends.  The Internet is young, and massively multiplayer gaming is even younger.  Given enough time, the number of people who play massively multiplayer games will begin to stabilize.  By that time there will be more options for online games to play than Hillary Clinton has lobbyists.  Not only will monthly prices drop, but you will be able to pick and choose the game that best suits <I>your</I> play style.  Existing game companies like Verant and Origin will have to start actually competing for your business.  They will be forced to take a serious look at how they treat their individual customers, because if they fail to satisfy their players, there will be a hundred other companies out there who will.  Suddenly the bottom line begins to <I>serve</I> the player's individual liberties - not strike against them.<P>If you don't believe me, then believe this... it's already happening.  Games like <A HREF="http://vampirevault.ign.com/">Vampire: The Masquerade</A> and <A HREF="http://nwvault.ign.com/">NeverWinter Nights</A> are already starting to elbow their way into homes.  Though technically not massively multiplayer games (though if some philanthropist invested in some serious hardware, they could be), I see them as a profound threat to the genre's profitability.<P>Think about it... imagine being able to play EverQuest <I>your</I> way, without being held hostage by Verant's Vision(tm).  Imagine being given the liberty to make Norrath in your image where you make up the rules of how the game should be played, where it makes sense that a bard can use a bow, or a warrior can use a special crystal given to him by a kind dragon to teleport home.  Imagine a world that is tailored to your ideals as a player, where you and the Dungeon Master see eye to eye on 95% of all play issues.  Imagine taking comfort in knowing that if any jerk comes along who openly shuns those ideals, that they can be swept away on a whim because they're not paying customers who claim a right to play it as they see fit.  Imagine being able to choose from <I>thousands</I> of Norraths to play in, making such "abuse" practically meaningless for yourself.<P>Considering all these things, I'm having a tough time mentally justifying ten dollars a month to play in a static world where a conglomerate of employees dictate how I am to advance my characters.  I much prefer the idea that I can form a one-on-one repertoire with the powers that be, so I can essentially find my own path as I go through my adventures.  If things turn sour on that server, I exit and explore elsewhere or even create a world of my own.  <P>Somehow I think I'm not the only one who finds this particular vision far more palatable than any massively multiplayer game could conceive.  Sooner or later, people will realize how much more freedom they can have for <I>no</I> monthly fee.  The only thing missing is thousands of players to interact with.  It's up to you to decide if that's a bad thing or not.<P>Well, contrary to appearances, I didn't mean for this to turn into an anti-EverQuest / anti-Verant / anti-massively multiplayer article.  I'm still an avid fan of the game, even if I do get cheesed off at some of the cavalier things Verant says and does from time to time.  It helps that I've chosen to roleplay characters that remain, for the most part, unconcerned about their level (at least, until it becomes convenient to).  If the rigors of camping and farming in EverQuest start grating on your nerves, I'd recommend giving it a try before canceling your account.  It can open a lot of unexpected doors for finding enjoyment and fulfillment in Norrath.  <P>It did for me.<P>- &lt;Shadoe&gt;

<P>
Greetings!<br><br>For those who do not know, as of this writing (6/21/2000), I am a level 52<br>Shaman with a 134 Alchemy skill. Just so you know my credentials ;)<br><br>I recently started selling gate potions. While this increased quite a bit<br>the number of questions I field everyday, I have always been asked things<br>about Alchemy. Also, on a regular basis, I have had to correct people with<br>misconceptions about Alchemy and the potions Alchemists can make.<br><br>This document is an attempt to address some of these in a public forum, sort<br>of a pre-emptive strike as it were.<br><br>*All player made alchemy potions have a CASTING TIME<br><br>**This means that all player made alchemy potions can be interrupted, just<br>like if you were casting a spell.<br><br>***However, the potion is not used up if interrupted, so you can try again.<br><br>*No Alchemy potions are stackable in Inventory<br><br>*Each potion is ONE dose, meaning that if it is successfully used, it goes<br>away. Just like a beer, you drink the beer, the beer goes away.<br><br>*Any race/class can use any Alchemy potion<br><br>*All potions that raise your Stats (STR, DEX, etc.) STACK with player cast<br>buffs. I call these STAT potions.<br><br>**All STAT potions have side effects, positive and negative. For example:<br>Greater Potion of Purity is +25 STR, +15 DEX and MINUS 20 STAmina (about<br>45hp for a level 50 shaman if remember right) However, if you are the dmg<br>dealer, and not the dmg taker, this is a great buff for warriors and melee<br>types with Proccing weapons. BTW, there are other STR potions with different<br>side effects.<br><br>**There are two types of potions. There are auras and then there are the<br>other physical stat potions. The auras are the potions with resists.<br><br>***Not all Aura potions will stack with the other potions. Of the ones that<br>can, you can only stack one aura potion with one physical stat potion. NOTE:<br>Purity and Power do NOT stack<br><br>*Potions that increase a STAT and/or resistance put up a Buff Icon. If your<br>screen has 15 buff Icons up already, it will not work. You will be given the<br>"This spell did not take hold" message and your potion will be GONE.<br><br>*Invis VS Undead Potion (IVU) works exactly like the player cast spell. So,<br>the duration is random. Also, if a MOB would see through an IVU spell cast<br>by a player, it will also see through the IVU potion. They are the same<br>effect.<br><br>*SoW Potions work in OUTDOOR zones only. If Shaman/Druid can CAST SoW in a<br>zone, then you can drink the potion in that zone. You can however drink the<br>potion while in an OUTDOOR zone and then go into an indoor zone and you will<br>still have SoW speed. Again, works just like the player cast SoW. Have been<br>told by customers that they last a long time tho, longer than a SoW buff<br>from a player.<br><br>*Shrink Potions currently work in DUNGEONS only (Fear and Hate zones are not<br>considered dungeons, although Sky is). Again, if a Shaman can cast the<br>Shrink spell in the zone, then you can use the potion too. It lasts as long<br>you stay in the zone. However, it will go away when you camp, sometimes when<br>you go LD, and if you change your form after drinking the potion (IOW, if<br>you drink shrink potion, then cast wolf form, shrink will go away. If you<br>want to be a teeny tiny wolf, go wolf form first, THEN drink potion) One<br>note on this, Verant has said that they will be making the potion work in<br>all zones "soon", whenever that is.<br><br>*Damage Shield potions are DRINKER dependant. (Level/4)+1 truncated (not<br>exact, but very close). So, no, you can't buy them for your level 4<br>character for twinking, unless you only want a 2 point damage shld. A level<br>48 player gets a 13 point Dmg Shld. Lasts 8 to 9 minutes and STACKS with ALL<br>player cast Damage shields.<br><br>*Potion of Frost goes to Everfrost. Have been told it drops you in the 3<br>Igloo area in Everfrost, near BB. If you can confirm, please do so :)<br><br>*Potion of Swamp goes to Innothule Swamp. You land in the Southern Hand that<br>sticks out of the swamp, where the Shadowmen are. Shadowmen pose me no<br>problems, but probably depends on your class/level. I wouldn't use Swamp<br>potion if you were level 20, that's for sure. The Feerrott zone is West of<br>the Hand<br><br>*The Lizard Blood Potion is NOT made by alchemists, it is dropped by a MoB.<br><br>*Alchemy made gate potions (Frost and Swamp) have about a 25 second casting<br>time (according to a customer report). Obviously not a get-away-quick<br>potion. It is a transportation potion. To help Tanks stuck in fear, or deep<br>inside a dungeon, when no porters are available, or even as a way to get to<br>Everfrost more quickly than porting to NK. I'm sure you can come up with<br>many other situations where it would be handy (Can we say Kunark? I knew you<br>could, hehe).<br><br>*The cost to a shaman to make a Potion is NOT the cost of the herbs that<br>make it. For example, using nice round fictional numbers that do not relate<br>to any potion in particular: Potion of Uberness requires Herb X and Herb Y.<br>Herb X costs 15pp and Herb Y costs 5pp. This means that the total cost per<br>ATTEMPT to make the potion is 20pp. If the Alchemists is 100% successful<br>(yea, right, heh) then it does indeed cost 20pp to make. BUT, if the success<br>rate is 75% instead, it actually costs the alchemist 26.7pp per success. If<br>50%, would cost 40pp per success. If 25%, would cost 80pp per success. That<br>is the cost to the alchemist to make the potion. From there, it is up to the<br>individual Alchemist to decide on a fair profit margin for himself and the<br>customer. But please do not confuse cost per attempt with cost per success.<br>I am constantly running into people who have gone on a website somewhere,<br>jotted down herb component prices, and now think they know how much it costs<br>to make the potion and try to argue with me about my prices.<br><br>*Alchemy skill is Level Capped and is a Shaman Only Skill. (Level-24)*5 For<br>example, a level 50 Shaman would have a cap of 130: (50-24)*5=130 This means<br>you must be at least at level 25 before being able to do any alchemy. Would<br>not suggest trying to make gate potions until skill of 130, although some<br>have started at 120 on other servers. Even if you start at 120 skill, you<br>have to be level 48 to be able to get a skill that high. So, no, you can't<br>create a mule shaman to make gate potions for you unless you are willing to<br>Powerlevel the Shaman to level 48-50 and are willing to spend lots of plat,<br>even with the price redux in herbs, will still take LOTS of plat to raise<br>your skill high enough after you get level 48.<br><br>I would like to thank the people of Bristlebane who frequent The Inn of<br>Bristlebane (<a href="http://www.draedon.com/cgi-bin/inn.pl">http://www.draedon.com/cgi-bin/inn.pl</a>) who helped with various<br>info and questions.<br><br>--Mebe Spiritbringer of Bristlebane (Halo of Fire)

Over the past month or so, I have read an increasing number of<br>complaints regarding the evil race factions on Kunark and how they make<br>it virtually impossible to function on the continent.  I play several<br>evil characters, and I have to say, "Shaddap and quit yer whinin."<br><br>First, I should remind those who are complaining that the game is not<br>meant to be easy - the fact that evil races can pretty much roam every<br>other continent in the game with little to no retribution is a testament<br>to the playability of the game as thought out by the production team. <br>It pleases me greatly, however, that Verant took the time to produce a<br>continent which won't let you race up to level 60 without some<br>forethought.<br><br>Second, the game is meant to be challenging for all levels.  Granted, we<br>all fall out of character from time to time as we spend endless hours<br>camping the same spawn for whatever flavor of magical candy we are after<br>that day.<br><br>In fact, I see the complexity of the factions on Kunark to be colorful<br>obstacles to be overcome by those who are the most ingenious.  Further,<br>I would not characterize Kunark as a region in which high-levels should<br>concentrate on levelling quickly - much of what is there is to provide a<br>variety of challenges rather than the ability to race through levels. <br>Moreso, I was glad to see the experience lowered for monsters of the<br>same caliber elsewhere in order to slow level advancement and<br>concentrate on the environment and thrill of the game.<br><br>Perhaps I am idealistic in this, and I am sure this will draw fire from<br>fellow high-levels who adventure to Kunark and feel they have no<br>stronghold there, but I don't think everything has to be equal between<br>races and classes.  The differences and complexities of faction and race<br>are just one more facet that makes this game truly an outstanding<br>MMORPG.<br><br>Oakgrove Fallingleaf

Here we go - a few words on those seemingly tireless individuals who<br>donate hundreds of hours of time to the game, field our praise and our<br>profanity, and strive to make our playing experience a little better. <br>As a former Senior Guide, I caught both sides of the act and hopefully<br>can offer some insight to dealing with these unusual individuals.<br><br>One of the first mistakes new players make is that they do not<br>distinguish between Guides and GMs.  Guides are NOT employees of Verant<br>or Sony, whereas GMs enjoy that status.  Guides are given special tools,<br>far more than Origin allowed their volunteer customer service reps, to<br>assist players.  Guides cannot, however, create any kind of item,<br>including cash, for a reimbursement; this is the realm of the GM. <br>Guides cannot reset zones or repop monsters - they can only kill stuck<br>monsters.  Guides can do several things - summon your corpse out of<br>lava, handle the initial stages of harassment or kill-stealing<br>incidents, investigate recurring bugs, resurrect you for bug-caused<br>deaths and give you basic instructions about the game.  GMs spend much<br>of their time performing tasks such as resetting zones, investigating<br>bugs, taking care of reimbursements, disciplining characters who abuse<br>the rules, and assisting with GM-run events.<br><br>The best way to reach a guide is through the petition system - it's the<br>easiest way for the Guide to track customer concerns and make sure<br>everyone is serviced.  This does not always happen in a timely manner -<br>just like any other organization, Guides are not always online.  Some<br>guides miss their shifts for real-world reasons.  It's unfortunate, but<br>some petitions can take 3 hour to get answered.  This is not the goal,<br>but staff limitations sometimes warrant this.  I received a number of<br>petitions from people who had petitioned before and received no response<br>- I always tried to make the time to ensure they were taken care of<br>properly.  This is an area in which players simply need to be patient.<br><br>I know that many players make use of the "who all GM" command and then<br>lament that no Gms/Guides are online and thus do not submit a petition. <br>You should keep in mind that about one third of the petitions received<br>are about harassment situations for which guides need to be invisible<br>and anonymous for investigation.  Thus, a Guide or GM may be online but<br>not visible to the player.<br><br>Also, I recall that a number of players have voiced complaints that<br>GMs/Guides favor specific groups on a server.  Initially, Guides have no<br>control over the server to which they are assigned, aside from<br>specifying their main play server.  No Guide may maintain a character on<br>ther server for which they guide to prevent the temptation to cheat. <br>Granted, there may be the occasional dishonest Guide, but these are<br>punished not only by removal from the Guide program but also by having<br>their accounts banned.<br><br>I hope I have addressed a number of areas in which players are unaware<br>of the roles of GMs and Guides.  This is a vast subject and I could go<br>on for much longer, but you would grow tired and might injure yourself<br>when your head smacked the keyboard.  If you have questions about the<br>Guide Program, I will be happy to answer them.  Feel free to e-mail me<br>at <a href="mailto:disneyvillain@home.com">disneyvillain@home.com</a>.<br><br>Oakgrove Fallingleaf

A chill wind blew from the ice covered mountains as the distant thud of giant footfalls echoed through the valley. At the moss covered ruins swirls of light materialized in the air as three adventurers came into view. <br><br>Boladorn still clasped Kahlani&#8217;s hand as the two steadied themselves from their journey. They took stock of themselves and began their journey eastward to the elven outpost in Firiona Vie. The trip was not without peril as both the bard and Paladin were cut down along the way&#8230; the victim of the insidious half dark elf, half spider creatures that infested the dreadlands. <br><br>Once their possessions had been recovered the trio continued their journey and arrived in Firiona Vie with little additional trouble. <br><br>After gathering supplies and catching their breath for a moment, the three continued their journey through the lands, passing through the Lake of Ill Omens then on to The Frontier Mountains. An elven scout brought word to the three that their presence was required in Overthere. They quickly made their way through the pass to Overthere. <br><br>Boladorn found signs of their passing and tracked the members of Cestus Dei to a ruined tower in the eastern portion of the zone. <br><br>"Hail and well met Cestus Dei" greeted the bard. The members present turned and greeted the bard as he arrived. The three new arrivals were greeted with slaps on backs and hugs all around as word had arrived before them of their falling in the dreadlands. "Quite the selfless act bard, our thanks to you for bringing Kahlani to us, we are in your debt kind sir" said Apostate the cleric of Cestus Dei. <br><br>Boladorn looked at the ground and shrugged off the compliment. "I know the lay of the lands well and I was headed this direction anyway, &#8216;twas my pleasure to escort such pleasant company as her" he replied. <br><br>Kahlani cleared her throat and approached Boladorn, a mischievous grin on her face. She drew her sword and came closer to Boladorn "Please kneel a moment if thou wouldst" she asked. Boladorn removed his helm and knelt at her feet. "For your acts of bravery and the selfless act of guiding me through the perils these lands are infested with I knight thee Boladorn, True Knight of Kahlani" she said solemnly. <br><br>Boladorn drew a deep breath and lowered his gaze to hide the blush that was spreading across his cheeks. He accepted the knighting and rose to his feet. For a while the group caught each other up on recent news while trying to clear the ancient ruins of the Sarnaks that infested them. After some time word came of Wurms wandering the burning wood and the decision was made to investigate. The group traveled to the burning wood without incident. <br><br>As the group prepared themselves for the coming hunt Boladorn studied the paladin as she sat in meditation. "What a wondrous woman she be" he thought to himself. "Could it be that there is more here than what I have seen so far, Could it be that I have in some way found a place in her heart?" he asked himself. <br><br>She looked up from her prayers and saw him watching her. She did not want to embarrass him so did not acknowledge his staring eyes. "What luck to find one such as he! One that would act so honorably, so selfless to guide a lost soul across these blasted lands for nothing in return" she thought. "Could all my efforts and faith be being rewarded?" she thought to herself. <br><br>She watched as the bard sped away tracking the spoor of the many Wurms that could be heard bellowing in the distance. He disappeared from view as the smoke swirled around him from the fires that raged this ravaged area. <br><br>She was left with a sense of emptiness and longing that she could not explain. Coupled with that was a hope that he would return safely so she could confirm or explain the feelings she had. <br><br>(To Be Continued)<br><br><b>To contact the author of this tale, please visit our public forum aka. <a href="http://www.lostorder.com/msgboards/conclave/">The Conclave</a>.

I play a Rogue, which happens to be the only class that gets the skill "Pick Pocket." This means that if the player base were equally divided, at most less then 8% of the player base (over level 7) would have ever even used this skill, let alone understands it. Rogues are one of the least played classes, which makes this percentage even smaller. It is my goal to share with you the workings of Pick Pocket.<br><br>Pick Pocket has been an issue nearly since release, and is often the deciding factor on a Rogue getting a group. Despite good, fast damage, unrivaled scouting and excellent corpse recovery, the Rogue class is still looked down upon simply because of this skill. Let me explain a few things about it.<br><br>Rogues acquire "Pick Pocket" at Level 7. It has a 10 second recycle time. First and foremost, nothing can be Pick Pocketed that is marked MAGIC or any items that are equipped; only humanoid creatures can be Pick Pocketed (i.e. no undead or animals). On top of that, no MOBs level 45+ can be Pick Pocketed whatsoever. Also, the Rogue has no control over what is taken items or coins. Even though items can be pick pocketed, it is a rare thing in the life of the Rogue. The majority of the time, coins will be stolen. Even then, it's not guaranteed that very much will be taken. At level 15, it is very rare for me to Pick Pocket Gold, Silver is almost common, but the majority of what I steal is Copper. I have never stolen Platinum. The deciding factor on how much is stolen (and how much can be stolen) is ultimately based on the MOB's loot pool. Although there was previously a bug that allowed a Rogue to endlessly steal small amounts of Copper, this has been corrected and everything stolen is now taken from the loot pool. So if the loot is considerably lower then normal, there has probably been a lot of Pick Pocketing going on (or an avid fan of the skill "Beg" hehe); you can also tell when a Rogue steal because many (mind you, not all) MOB's will yell, "Stop Thief! <Rogue's name>"<br><br>As unfriendly as this skill sounds it can be useful to others besides the Rogue. Although Rogues are a pure melee class, we don't get the skill "Taunt." Many of us would like it, to have even better personal crowd control (in addition to Evade). As Backstab has a taunt factor built into it, so does Pick Pocket. It is possible to taunt a MOB off someone with Pick Pocket.<br><br>One of the main reason we like to Pick Pocket is simply to keep this skill maxed out. Around level 20+, Pick Pocketing becomes more of a hindrance then a help to a Rogue. The constant loot of small change quickly adds to his weight, thus making the coins virtually useless.<br><br>I, and the majority of the Rogues I know, ask before Pick Pocketing in a group. If you are a Rogue reading this, or an aspiring one, I encourage you to do the same. I hope that we can make this skill more understood and less rejected. <br><br>The Safehouse (*THE* Rogue message forum) has many excellent FAQ's and guides about the Rogue class. One of them happens to be about Pick Pocket. If you are interested to know more, I'd advise you to go to this link to learn more: <a href="http://pub2.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselibraryreadonly.showMessage?topicID=20.topic">Tome of Mastery: Picking Pockets</a>.<br><br>Kambic the Rogue<br>Rallos Zek       <br>Of the Safehouse

<P>
There is a few things that you can look at when determining what makes a 'Quality' guild. Most of these views are assuming that the guild has a website from which you can investigate. <br><br>One of the first things to look at is the management of the team. Without exceptional management, a guild will generally be it's worst enemy. Keeping control of any organization can be a difficult and daunting task that requires alot of work and determination. The management of the guild must be able to consistently handle trouble within the guild and eliminate it, or problems will only get worse. Situations often arise which need to be handled and dealt with appropriately. There should be some form of code of conduct that is in-line with what you expect from your fellow guild mates. It is also important that this is enforced. Management that is unwilling or unable to uphold their Mission Statement, or remove problem members will also be a liability. Reviewing the guild policies or charter can generally give a good indication of what kind of guild you are dealing with, assuming that they follow through with what their Charter states. <br><br>Another aspect to consider is community. Many guilds claim to be a 'family', but are they a dysfunctional one? How the members interact with one another is vital. Does the guild provide means to strengthen this community? Whether it be a chat room, message board, mailing list, or other means of communication. If the guild has a message board, browse it and read how their members interact. If the board is filled with hostility and angst, I would expect the guildchat to be similar. Is the message board unused or rarely posted on? This can also be a good indication of the sense of community in a guild. <br><br>Also consider what type of player you are, and whether you fit in with the guild you are looking into. As we all know, every guild has different priorities and objectives. Ask yourself what aspects of the game you consider enjoyable. Are you a role-player? power-gamer? a little of both? When looking, you should make sure that a guild can meet your needs as a player. <br><br>The most important aspect of a successful guild is their recruitment policies. Guilds should make sure that the guild and the player are compatible before allowing membership. I look down on guilds which offer open recruiting via public channels. Considering that you will spend your online time consistently with these people, you want to make sure that there is some kind of filtering process. Although this is somewhat related to the above paragraph in making sure that the guild offers what you need, it puts the responsibility of that determination on the guild management, where it should be. An alternative to this would be if the guilds have an open invite policy, but remove the undesirables quickly. I have found that slow recruitment often prevents members from being removed later. <br><br>A guild's reputation on a server often can give you an indication of what kind of people you are dealing with, and whether they follow through with their intentions. It is common that most players will think that their guild is the best and the greatest, but what do other people on the server think? Of course, your own personal experiences here should hold more weight then anything you have heard. <br><br>I am sure there are other things to consider when determining what makes a 'Quality' guild, but I think these are the most important. <br><br>Jubal Kinseeker<br>Guildmaster of the Sterling Order of Knights

A soft drizzle spattered at his feet making the air hang heavy with the smell of decay as was normal around the docks of Freeport. Boladorn sat patiently awaiting the boat to be loaded for Faydwer and the Butcherblock Mountains. He removed his helm to allow some coolness to circulate his brow.<p>A young bard joined him at the docks and asked for some advice, they spoke about small matters, something to speed the time awaiting the boat's departure. A voice like a songbird came from behind them, startling Boladorn out of his conversation. "Pardon me sires, can either of hide me from the eyes of the corrupt guards here? I am afraid they will kill me on sight" <p>Boladorn turned and was struck by a vision of beauty the likes of which he had never seen before. "Aye lady I can keep ye unseen" he replied. He asked the beautiful Paladin to join him and removed a small pipe from his bag. He quickly looked over his notes and began playing a somber song on the pipes. The music began to move faster and Boladorn began to dance a jig, tendrils of mist began to swirl and writhe around them as if they had entered a bank of fog. Soon they disappeared from view completely. Boladorn looked up from his pipes and noticed the Paladin watching him intently. "That's quite the jig ye dance m'lord" she remarked. He winked and returned to his song.<p>The dockhands finished loading the boat and the call for passengers to board was raised. The two boarded the boat quickly and Boladorn allowed them to return to view so that they might speak to the captain. The hold was quite full and the day's rain had faded and turned into a bright and sunny one. Boladorn found a seat on stacked bails of sailcloth and admired the Paladin from his perch. <p>She turned and caught him staring. Boladorn quickly looked at the ground not wanting to show the crimson his face had turned. The Paladin approached Boladorn and took a seat next to him. "Do ye know the new continent well Bard?" she asked. "Aye, I know it well lady, I am headed that way if'n ye needs a guide" he replied.<p>Their arrival in the Butcherblock Mountains was a somber one. Crowds of people were gathered at the docks, scanning the faces of the passengers hoping to see loved ones or friends among those disembarking. Boladorn stopped one of the guards and asked what all the ruckus was about. "Pirates it seems, now move along there willna be boats from or to Kunark for the time bein." He replied and returned to policing the crowds.<p>Boladorn shrugged off the delay, but he could see the concern for those lost at sea in the Paladin's eyes. "Come with me" he said. "I'll take us to the wood elf forest and see about magical transport to the new lands" he said. As they ran he hummed a tune to make the journey flow faster.<p>They arrived without incident and began the search for an obliging wizard or druid. Several court pages from Felwithe were gathered finishing up their midday meal. Boladorn gave them each a silver and asked them to take messages to the local guild halls with requests for transportation as the boats had been waylaid by pirates.<p>The two sat and enjoyed a small snack as they waited. "Lady I fear that in our travels I have no introduced myself. I am Boladorn Stormsong of the Lost Order of Akalabeth" he said. She looked at him and smiled and replied: "I am Kahlani Lar of Knight of Cestus Vie" she said with a grin. "I must thank you for taking the time to guide me in my travels m'lord, not many would take the time as thou hast done" she said.<p>Boladorn smiled and cleared his throat. "Lady I am headed that way so there is no trouble, and with you along the journey is not so long" he said. Presently a wizard belonging to the same order as Kahlani arrived and greeted the two travelers. "Greetins and well met friends" he said. "Dalzuth my friend!" exclaimed Kahlani as she rushed over to greet the wizard. The situation was explained and Dalzuth agreed to transport the travelers to the new continent. As Dalzuth began his incantations Boladorn looked at Kahlani and saw a small hint of worry in her eye. He reached over and clasped her hand and winked at her. The worry fell from her face, and she returned his smile with a wink.<p>Boladorn knew from that moment that this journey would prove to be more interesting. <p>(To be continued) <P><b>Have a comment to make about this story?

On this topic, I definitely know what I'm talking about. I used to work at AOL's TOS (Terms of Service) department. Some of you might be familiar with them... My primary job was to scan the thousands of room names and screen names and get rid of the ones that were offensive in AOL's sole discretion. Room names like DADEESPANKZLILGRL and EYEKUM4UNOW were verboten and therefore removed from the public eye. It was a never-ceasing job. For 8 hours a day I scanned lists over and over and over, searching the creative and obscure spellings for vulgarity, illegal activity, and unacceptable behavior. Yes, I was the Thought Police. ;) After a few weeks of practice, I could scan a list of a couple of hundred names in a few seconds and pick out the ones that were vulgar. It became reflex. <br><br>One of the more insidious consequences of this work was the eventual ability to spot hidden vulgarity in license plates, internet names, etc. And especially EQ character names, even when the player behind the name hadn&#8217;t intended it. For instance, I came across the seemingly-innocent name Canilea on one of the servers. I started laughing and sent a tell to the unfortunate young lady, letting her know that I thought her character name was funny. When she questioned me about it, having no idea what I meant, I carefully explained to her that the name said &#8220;Can I lay ya?&#8221; She reacted rather violently and pretty much called me a pervert. Rather than explain why I couldn&#8217;t HELP but see something off-color in her name, I just let her think I was a random psycho and vowed not to do that again. Instead, I&#8217;ll merely stick with /petitioning those names that I find that should be removed from the game. <br><br>I rather enjoy seeing all those unique fantasy names, and I admit that names like Dudeone, Raistlin, Gandalf, or Anikan Skiwolker (yes, the name exists on one of the servers) really bother me and for just a few minutes sort of suck some of the fun out of the game. Mind you, I&#8217;m not a die-hard in-game roleplayer, but names like that just bug me. In Greater Faydark, which seems to collect all the psychos of Norrath in one neat little package, I came across the name Filatio. For those of you who don&#8217;t know why that bothered me, I humbly suggest that you look up the word fellatio in a good dictionary. Filatio happens to be a homonym of it. I can&#8217;t imagine that the person who created that name didn&#8217;t know what they were doing. It&#8217;s just too convenient. But then, I was trained to be cynical about that sort of thing. Regardless, homonyms of vulgar words are, according to Verant&#8217;s policy, not allowed. I petitioned the name THREE times on separate days. For some reason, the guides and GM&#8217;s wouldn&#8217;t get rid of this obviously illegal and irritating name. I have no idea if it&#8217;s still in the game or not, but it SHOULD have been removed. Immediately. <br><br>The point? The point is that no matter what Abashi says on the subject, I absolutely, willfully REFUSE TO BELIEVE that there are real, live human beings who check the character names as they are created. If so, there wouldn&#8217;t be all those names like Buttmuncher, Biteme, and Darthmaul. If there are actually people screening those names, I humbly suggest that they be trained a little better. Or at the least, Verant should change their policy and hire specific individuals whose sole job it is to monitor game content instead of letting every on-duty guide and GM serve as a bulwark for inappropriate names. Hire someone with a decent vocabulary who can recognize homonyms and obscure references. And for pity&#8217;s sake, take out the Star Wars names&#8230; They&#8217;re gonna get a WHOLE GAME ALL TO THEMSELVES soon. And man, I just can&#8217;t wait to get rid of &#8216;em. <br><br>Ulalume (That&#8217;s from a Poe poem, y&#8217;all&#8212;guilty as charged) <br>Ranger, The Tribunal

	Cobus and Berglad ran as fast as their legs could carry them. Their boots caught roots and were embedded in the soil as they ran. It was only their resolve that kept them upright. The Faydark was quite its namesake once the sun had fallen. Thankfully, both the elf and the dwarf had excellent vision at night. Unfortunately, though, vampires did not have true blood. Nor did they create any heat. An entire legion of them could be right in front of the pair, and they wouldn&#8217;t know it until they were upon them. <br><br>Lightning, however, causes much heat.<br><br>The sky seemed to be a thunderous storm right over what appeared to be the battlefield. Blast after blast rained down like vengeance from the Gods. Once they came closer, the warmth of fire engulfed them, as many corpses were still afire. Cobus reached the edge of a hill, and his vision portrayed a valiant sight. There moved a single druid, half flying, half running his way through a myriad of undead. In his wake stood burning corpses, blackened bones, and shattered vampires. Cobus was for a moment held admiring the abilities of his long time friend. The next moment he reminded himself that mana has limits. With that he charged in, with Berglad close behind him. <br><br>Cobus dashed into the fray, occupying several new reinforcements coming forth from the Lesser Faydark. His wakizashi parried every attack perfectly, as his angled blade of Morin tore through reanimated tissue. Zombie after zombie, ghoul after ghoul, Cobus continually felled his opponents. Berglad fought along side him, with mighty swings of his Ghoulsbane. A particularity tough zombie parried a blow with its forearm, losing it in the process. Still it fought on, landing two strong bashes at Berglad&#8217;s armor. The Ghoulsbane glowed bright blue, having unleashed heaven&#8217;s fury on the zombie. Flayed flesh was simply thrown from its hide, as the zombie was reduced to ashes. <br><br>A valiant call had risen from his heart. &#8220;For Brell Serilis!!&#8221;, shouted Berglad as his blade divided a ghoul into two.<br><br>Cobus had just dispatched a skeleton when another, armed with dual axes, launched toward him. Cobus was barely able to parry the flying attack as the axes came in for dual strikes. Cobus did what he could, flipping backwards and regaining his balance. Much to his surprise, the skeleton before him stood some 10 feet tall. One expected such a large creature to move lethargically. Unfortunately, this wasn&#8217;t the case, as the skeleton began to attack as quickly as before. For every slash Cobus blocked, he lost ground and stamina. He was losing this battle. His wakizashi and Morin blade rose to block a single, powerful strike, just as the other axe began it&#8217;s decent. Cobus could feel the steel entering his side, even before it happened. He let out a violent shout, as his chainmail absorbed the slash, doing nothing to the concussion. As the skeleton recoiled for another attack, it was bathed in a jet of fire from over Cobus&#8217; shoulder. Cobus quickly prayed for a blessing of short flight, as he arched over the skeleton. His blades came down strong, breaking the weakened bone into a crumble. The skeleton had been reduced to a flaming morass of bone in mere seconds. With this, the other undead became unorganized, and as vampires retreated, the flow of undead into the Faydark had lessened. Cobus surveyed the battleground, seeking stragglers or civilians. When he found nothing, he turned to locate his comrades. Aeril was tending to a wounded child, while Berglad was cleaning his blade of material it had &#8220;collected&#8221; during the fight. Cobus approached Aeril, quickly remembering the massive gash on his side. <br><br>&#8220;You fight as well as ever, Aeril&#8221;<br>&#8220;If not a bit better&#8221; added Berglad<br>Aeril finished tending to the young one, and stood to face Cobus.<br>&#8220;It seems fate is much more on my side than against it. Your timing couldn&#8217;t have been better old friends.&#8221;<br>Berglad grew red &#8220;I am not old!&#8221;<br><br>The elves chuckled. Aeril spoke &#8220;I see nothing has changed. How have you been, Cobus?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Good, to say the least anyway. We were coming to visit you when we heard of this battle. I haven&#8217;t seen anything like this since we tried to breach the castle at Mistmoore itself.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;It was quite a battle, and quite refreshing. Spending months turning a ruined tower into a place of Nature is very taxing on your mind&#8221;. Aeril had been trying to make a home for himself. He had found an old tower in Lesser Faydark that had probably been made by the scum from Mistmoore. It was so dead, so haunting. He had transformed it into a small utopia of life. It was quite a tiring, but rewarding process.<br>&#8220;Aye, ya&#8217;think we could see this tower of yours?&#8221; questioned Berglad.<br>Cobus interjected &#8220;Soon. Right now, Aeril, we need your help&#8221;<br><br>A smile came to Aeril&#8217;s face &#8220;Another crazy plan, Cobus?&#8221;<br>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s a bit risky, but well within reason . .&#8221;<br>	&#8220; . . . Of a crazy wood elf &#8220; finished Berglad<br>&#8220;Well, out with it. What do you have planned?&#8221;<br>Cobus retold the story of Unrest, how the council wanted someone to clear it, and of the mystical boots that could be found there.<br>&#8220;Sounds like a quest worth of completion. Is it to be just us three?&#8221;<br>Cobus smirked &#8220;Oh come now. You know I want the six of us in on it. I figured to get you first so you could provide travel&#8221;<br>Berglad grumbled &#8220;I hate teleporting. It makes me sick.&#8221;<br>&#8220;Almost as much as I hate warriors who don&#8217;t make use of plate mail vambraces. Is the maneuverability that important .  . .&#8221;<br>Aeril and Cobus laughed once more. Good old Berglad was always there to make sense of everything. Cobus coughed again in pain of from his wound. Aeril said a small prayer, and used the last of his mana to mend the broken flesh. The feeling of relief swept over Cobus, like a splash of cool water. It was good to be together once more.<br><br><br>They arrived in Kelethin by sunrise. The first thing they did was rent an inn and catch up on some much needed rest. The city of Kelethin was quite a marvel. Seated high above the ground, it was a city that lived in the air, bound to the massive trees of the Faydark. It was also a literal death trap to newcomers. Many a visitor had fallen to great injury or even death. Even with it&#8217;s subtle danger, Kelethin was gorgeous; a true achievement in elven craftsmanship. It was also well known for its hospitality. Cobus awoke midday, remembering that the day ahead was busy. Aeril would rest all day to be prepared for the teleport, while Cobus and Berglad would gather supplies and call in favors. The residents of Antonica were usually hospitable to elves, but dwarves were a bit harder to accommodate. Cobus walked to the bank, enjoying the rustle of the city. As he came to be bank, he saw none other than his archrival Sirene. As kids they had played together on often. They had both chosen the path of the ranger. Since a small competition in their early teens, they had strived to over-achieve the other. It was usually friendly, though recently it had become sour. They even argued over whom had the better equipment. Now those arguments were the definition of useless. Sure she had the fabled sword of the Ykesha, but his armor was way nicer than her . . <br><br>&#8220;Cobus&#8221;<br>The sneer in that call was like an arrow.<br>&#8220;Long time no see. Not like anything has changed&#8221;, she said, showing her obviously new greaves.<br>&#8220;And I see you have some need to wear stolen plate mail?&#8221;<br>&#8220;These leggings came off the Froglock Crusader himself, deep in the caverns of Guk!&#8221;<br>&#8220;That&#8217;s nice. Did you kill him or take them with other &#8216;methods&#8217; ?&#8221;<br>Her sword was into her hand in the flash of a heartbeat, just in time to collide with a guard&#8217;s shield. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be having none of that&#8221;.<br>Cobus could do nothing but grin. &#8220;Sorry, I couldn&#8217;t imagine what came over to me to think that the great Sirene would actually use manipulation to acquire something. Must be a passing thought.&#8221;<br>For the first time, he had actually left a confrontation with her feeling better than when he entered it. &#8220;On to the bank to get money now!&#8221; a small voice told him.<br><br><br>The three of them stood just out of the visual range of Kelethin. When a druid teleported you, you feel as though you were sent to the clouds. A massive wind made every step you took a giant one. In minutes you could cover ground that took days. A druid had to send each person to this place, one at a time. A wizard&#8217;s portal was quicker, but many preferred the experience of the walking on clouds. Aeril summoned all his energies, and prayed to Tunare to give him the key to open the pathways towards the clouds. A blue aura first enveloped Berglad, and he vanished. Cobus saw the aura around him, and as he blinked, he opened his eyes to a new world, where the sun was very bright and the clouds were surreal. Soft and misty to the touch yet stable to the foot. Aeril suddenly appeared in front of them and he gestured toward the sun. As the three of them walked, the environment amazed them. Aeril had traversed this place time and again, yet the wonders of its beauty still dazzled him. Cobus and Berglad had been before, but like anyone not totally accustomed to it, time passed before they got the feel of walking in the clouds. Just when Cobus finally started to truly enjoy the experience, they plummeted to Norrath. Once again, Cobus blinked, and opened his eyes to the Druid ruins of the Commonlands. Once his companions appeared, they set off toward Freeport.<br><br>&#8220;Damnit I hate that last part&#8221; a grumpy Berglad said.<br>&#8220;Cant ye makit a bit smoothar?&#8221;<br>&#8220;Next time you&#8217;re in a shrine to Tunare&#8221; Aeril chuckled, &#8220;Be sure to make a request&#8221;. Cobus could only hope that Beppe would be as much fun as Berglad was.<br><br><b>Please send all comments to <a href="mailto:spilla@home.com">spilla@home.com</a>.</b>

<P>
The twilight of Unrest always seemed magical. It was like a viscous liquid that rippled as you walked through it. So fitting was this aura though. The Estate of Unrest was surely one of magic. The dwarven spirit that haunted and perverted it had done so for ages. This day, however, it was time for him to rest. Six adventurers, sent by their beloved council, were to probe deep into the depths of Unrest and find this spirit. The Fier&#8217;dal Elders had sent them to either convince the spirit to depart or dispose of it. The reward was grand, though the peace of mind that would accompany Faydwer would be much appreciated. <br><br><center>--------------------------------</center><br>And so stood the six; A ranger, a paladin, a dastardly rogue, a druid, a cleric, and a mighty wizard. They were all of different race, all of different religion. Yet aligned in this righteous task they stood as friends, as companions, and even as brothers. Such had not been so forever, though. <br><br>Cobus Mistwielder walked through the tranquil Faydark. Such a lovely place, so bright under the gracious sun. It was the home of the ranger, the forest was always his home. It never dawned on him that the forest could be a place of danger. There was always a place to run to, a place to hide, even a place to fight. The ranger gleamed in his brilliant green chain mail, a testament to his adventures. His shady blonde hair and dark brown eyes were so rightly elven. What was a wood elf without all those sharp features, anyway? <br><br>He was on his way to Kaladim to meet up with an old friend whom he had not seen for weeks. Such a trek did involve quite a bit of time. As so, he began to invoke himself with the spirit of the wolf. His feet became faster and the forest disappeared into a blur, though he still felt as if he was walking. Tunare treated her servants well. He could be in Kaladim by the next dawn. All was quiet, until he heard the cry of battle. He decided to investigate these cries, finding what he had expected.<br><br>A young high elven couple was being menaced by a band of orcs. The male was doing what he could with this crude sword to slow the advance of the band, but they were already being flanked. &#8220;By Tunare&#8217;s will, the damned orcs ought to stop their petty attacks!&#8221; Cobus thought to himself. He drew his blades and set into battle.<br><br>Cobus unleashed a small lightning bolt at the lead orc, dropping it dead. The others turned to face him, stunned but enraged. Two orcs ran straight toward him, while others continued to attack the couple. Cobus maneuvered beautifully, placing himself between the orcs. His angled blade slashed the weapon-wielding hand of one orc, while his wakizashi sliced the tendons of the other orcs ankles. Both fell to the ground in pain, one unable to move. Cobus finished his assault in a whirlwind of blades, leaving two dead orcs.<br><br>The others, seeing their leaders killed began to back away from the couple. As Cobus started toward them, they ran off in terror. Cobus approached the shaken couple.<br>&#8220;Are you both alright?&#8221;<br>&#8220;Yes thank you!&#8221; The high elf male said, &#8220;Thank Tunare you came when you did! I am Cyrus Highmoon, noble of Felwithe. You shall be greatly rewarded for your courage&#8221; <br>Cobus turned to the female, taking her hand and giving it a light kiss, &#8220;You must be Celliya Highmoon, then. It is a pleasure to meet such a compassionate one to those less fortunate.&#8221; <br>She returned his comment &#8220;I am indeed. I am very grateful of your help. What was your name? I didn&#8217;t catch it earlier&#8221; <br>&#8220;My name is not important. Instead of paying me money, do your best to continue your great work. The community of elves is only greatened by your labour .&#8221;<br>&#8220;As it is, farewell then ranger. And thank you again for your deeds!&#8221; The couple walked off at a steady pace in the direction of Felwithe.<br>Such was the life of a ranger. So much good done, yet never any credit. That was how Tunare wanted it, no? <br>&#8220;Stay on track. Kaladim isn&#8217;t all that far&#8221; he told himself as he once again asked Tunare for the blessing of wolf speed.<br><br><br>In the holy halls of Kaladim, Berglad Stormbane sat studying some of the ancient lore that was kept there. In all his training, he had taken the time to learn to read and write. Such was uncommon amongst the dwarves. It was unfortunate, for the dwarves could tell stories well. Tales of valor, bravery, compassion filled the ancient texts. It made one proud to be of dwarven heritage, even as proud as the paladin. As he reached the end of a particularly impressive story, a knock came to his door. <br><br>&#8220;Stormbane, there is a green wood elf here to see ye. Shall&#8217; I lettimin?&#8221; Berglad knew at once he it was.<br>&#8220;Aye, let him in!&#8221;<br>In stepped his closest friend, the tree-hugging ranger who caused so much trouble in their past.<br>&#8220;Cobus! Ha ha! Where have yo&#8217;been yea tree hugging elf!&#8221;<br>&#8220;Obviously roaming around endlessly bored. Or else why would I be here?&#8221;<br>Berglad snickered &#8220;Come sit down. Would ya have me fetch some ale?&#8221;<br>&#8220;Not now, old friend. It seems I have some business to discuss.&#8221;<br>Berglad recognized the tell-tale expression of Cobus. He was really here for business.<br>&#8220;Alright, out with it.&#8221;<br>&#8220;It seems the council has had enough with Unrest. Innocent fishermen are being injured and even killed by night as they take cover from the rain. They want someone to go in and banish that ghost that haunts the basement. I think we ought to give it a shot&#8221;<br>Berglad contemplated the offer before him.<br>&#8220;So you wan&#8217;us to accomplish what no one else has done? And for what? Are ye rich en&#8217;ff already?&#8221;<br>&#8220;You know the myths as well as I do. Those boots are supposed to carry great magic. What a great prize. Not to mention that I . . we might finally be commended for doing something good.&#8221;<br>&#8220;Have you talked to the others? What do they think?&#8221;<br>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t had a chance to even contact them. I am always coming up with these schemes. With you behind me, it&#8217;ll be much easier to convince them to come along.&#8221; Cobus&#8217; face turned in a silly half grin.<br>&#8220;Would be nice to fight together again, too.&#8221;<br>Berglad couldn&#8217;t agree more. &#8220;It&#8217;as been too long.  .  . Alright alright.  Undead have always been something I enjoy destroying anyway. Plus, these boots are getting old&#8221;, Berglad clanked his plate mail boots to the floor.<br> &#8220;How long has it been since you even wore the old tunic and wielded the sword?&#8221;<br>&#8220;Too long Cobus, too long. I hope I am still in shape enough to carry them. I guess we ought to go out and find Aeril.&#8221;<br>&#8220;Already started looking for him. I heard he was still trying to fix up that tower in the Lesser Faydark. I say it&#8217;s worth a trip. You with me old man?&#8221;<br>Berglad growled. &#8220;I am not that much older than you! Stop callin&#8217; me that before I smash your small head.&#8221;<br>&#8220;Always with the violence,&#8221; chuckled Cobus.<br><br>Berglad always looked funny in his armor. His beard always got messed and just plain clashed. His mithril breastplate shined lavender in the sunlight, while his massive Ghoulbane was like a beacon. Its light could be seen from even the greatest distance. Almost like an invitation to danger, though most beings knew better. The only things that were not stereotypically dwarven about Berglad were his eyes. Bright green, they were a seeming rarity amongst dwarves. He walked alongside Cobus at a steady pace. Although Cobus wanted to enhance their speed, Berglad wanted to enjoy the scenery a bit. He didn&#8217;t get outside of Kaladim all that much. It was nice once and a while. The Butcherblocks were such a magnificent chain of mountains. It was like a natural defense of Kaladim, while at the same time providing a home. Sure, they were plagued with goblins, but what was a couple of goblin tribes against the might of Kaladim? They walked for most of the day and placed a camp near the valley into the Greater Faydark. During the night, they were awakened by a young wood elf male, with blood-ridden clothes. <br><br>Berglad woke first, starring groggily at the wood elf.<br>&#8220;Whattis it youngster?&#8221;<br>&#8220;Vampires. They&#8217;re in the Faydark. Mistmoore sent them to break up a celebration to Tunare. My family . . help please!!<br>The final shout woke Cobus fully.<br>&#8220;What is wrong child?&#8221; he asked.<br>&#8220;Cobus, get your gear. It seems Mistmoore decided to raid in on a grand party.&#8221;<br><br>The young wood elf spoke &#8220;You must hurry please! There is a mighty druid who is holding them off, but he cannot last forever.&#8221;<br>Cobus and Berglad exchanged quick glances and hurried their pace. It seems their meeting with Aeril would come more swiftly that they thought. <br>

<P>
	&#8220;Stay close to me,&#8221; said the Wizard in purple.  &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to get ambushed in here, so be careful and alert.&#8221;<br><br>	The party members looked around and saw nothing that signified any danger, but they knew that if Izzi told them to be wary, then they must be wary.<br><br>	Izzi Fizzlethorpe, Erudite Wizard and High Lord of At Fates Hands, the secret society formed of Norrathian adventurers by Izzi himself.  Izzi was every bit the classic looking Erudite, his dark skin and lean features matched only by the permanent furrow in his brow from continuously trying to perplex some issue.  Izzi was a master tactician and a brilliant man.  He had shown the world that views of the Erudite Elitist Society were not his own, forsaking their snobbery and holier-than-thou attitudes for one closer to brotherhood and kindness.  He was respected in all circles, and a welcome friend and confidant.<br><br>	&#8220;What are we looking for?&#8221; asked the other wizard at Izzi&#8217;s side.  Gobo Brimfire was every bit the spitting image of his teacher and friend, Izzi, except that his robe was a sheen of a forest green rather than the metallic purple that had become Izzi&#8217;s trademark with the rest of the guild.  Gobo was an Erudite of normal proportions: tall and lanky, with a sense of grace that had been overwhelmed by the years of studying books in the Library of Erudin.  Gobo&#8217;s eyes shifted from left to right down each corridor, constantly searching for the trouble that Izzi made reference.  However, nothing stirred within the quiet walls of Guk.<br><br>	&#8220;Same thing we are always looking for,&#8221; replied the older wizard, a smile playing on his lips.<br><br>	Brim looked at his two companions and sighed.  Izzi constantly spoke in riddles and incomplete verse, always preoccupied with planning of some adventure.  Gobo was voicing the same concerns of the other party members, which at the moment was, &#8220;What are we doing here?&#8221;  <br><br>Brim Stonecutter, High Elf Enchanter from Felwithe had heard of the legendary journeys of Izzi from his cousin the Cleric who had in the past fought side by side with the Erudite.  He had spun wondrous tales of trips all over Norrath, battling many creatures that Brim had never imagined.  He had thought these to be mostly fiction until meeting with the wizard and eventually teaming up with him and his companions.  He now believed the impossible.<br><br>	Brim was often timid and shy compared to his wizard companions.  He was well known for his &#8220;sit back and examine&#8221; approach to everything, and it often took him much longer than others to make normal decisions.  His alabaster skin and thin frame also gave him the ability to easily blend in with, if not hide from, other members of his party.  As he studied the two wizards, he felt a hot and acrid wind on his shoulder, along with a slimy drip of something skittle down his blue robe.<br><br>	Brim turned and looked into the yellow-green eyes and black-toothed grin of the next member of their group.  Jarnvid <lastname> had to be the ugliest Ogre Brim had ever seen, not that he had seen many.  Jarnvid&#8217;s oversized nose and pockmarked face blended all too well with the rest of his oversized head atop his massive body.  He was easily three times the width across as Brim, and towered over the Elf like a full grown adult over a child.  <br><br>Jarnvid was a Shaman they had run across some time back and invited into their group without haste.  Despite his hungry, drooling smile and hideous looks, Jarnvid was about the best companion anyone could have.  His loyalty and honor were matched by few, and his ethics &#8211; something Brim didn&#8217;t even believe Ogres knew about &#8211; were of the highest regards for his companions.  The Ogre was a welcome addition to the group, and his simple yet matter-of-fact attitude often kept the group from becoming too serious.<br><br>Brim smiled at his oversized companion and asked, &#8220;Do you mind?  You are drooling on my robe.&#8221;<br><br>Jarnvid&#8217;s grin grew even larger and he emitted a low chuckle as he stood up even taller, nearly hitting his head on the ceiling of the corridor.  Brim smiled back and carefully brushed the drool off of his shoulder.  The Elf had once heard a story about how Ogres loved to eat the Elfin and Fairy creatures of Norrath, and when his big friend looked at him so, he often wondered if such tales were true.  He quickly shook the thought from his head and decided that if he was going to be Ogre food, it would have happened ages ago.<br><br>&#8220;Me Sorry, fren Brim,&#8221; boomed the Ogre, and Brim noticed that when Jarnvid said his name, a line of saliva always seemed to shoot into the air and land on him.  Ye gods, did the Ogre have a drooling problem.<br><br>Izzi waved the enchanter and shaman into silence as a figure crept around the corner at the end of the hall.  Brim couldn&#8217;t tell from his position in the back, but it appeared to be human formed.  Brim could see the figure gesture with a few signs and sensed Izzi sigh in relief.  &#8220;Come, it is safe,&#8221; he breathed and they walked down the corridor to the mystery person there.  As the shadows descended and Brim was able to make out the form, he too smiled and let out a sigh.<br><br>Olwen Brytangel stood crouched up against the wall at the end of the hallway, an ever-present smirk twisting from his lips.  The Half Elf Paladin gesticulated to Izzi as in a form of reverence and both their smiles grew wide.<br><br>&#8220;Sir Olwen,&#8221; dripped the honeyed words from Izzi.  He put an emphasis on the &#8220;Sir&#8221; and Brim grinned at the reference.  Olwen had reluctantly accepted the title as one of the guild officers after faithful service to the guild.  Izzi knighted so few, and even Brim was taken aback from the title given.  &#8220;It is good to see you, and in one piece.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Took you long enough, it did,&#8221; replied the Half Elf.  Brim noticed his words equaled the common dialect of most humans, and knew that Olwen probably spent a more time with humans than Elfin races, more than likely being shunned by the Elfin.  Elves tended to be like Erudites in that respect, and that was something that Brim had often frowned upon from his brothers and sisters.  He would never understand the reasoning behind their callous racial issues.<br><br>Olwen was stocky, even if he would have been full human, with a light olive skin tone that seemed to blend perfectly with the armor and tunic he wore.  His sword was currently sheathed and his shield was slung over his back, but Brim knew from prior experience with the Paladin that both could be out of their harnesses within a second and ready for battle.  Olwen was a pious and righteous individual, as all Paladins tended to be, and sometimes his faith could cloud his judgement of a situation.  However, Olwen&#8217;s war and combat skills rivaled that of the most legendary knights and warriors and Brim was proud to have him fight by his side.<br><br>Suddenly, Gobo&#8217;s head shot up and he began to look around the corridor.  &#8220;Did you hear that?&#8221; he asked and went back to surveying his immediate area.  The others took caution from the young wizard&#8217;s actions and began to ready themselves for whatever may be happening.<br><br>&#8220;Me no hear nuthin&#8217;,&#8221; grumbled Jarnvid.  &#8220;You mus be hearin&#8217; tings.&#8221;  Brim wasn&#8217;t certain if Ogres had a keen sense of hearing, but he knew that as a shaman, Jarnvid often had many abilities above and beyond that of a normal creature.<br><br>Being the only Elf in the party, Brim used his finely tuned senses to see if he could pinpoint what it was that Gobo might have heard.  He thought he could hear&#8230; something, like a scratching, but he couldn&#8217;t be sure.  It may have just been the echoes from the cavern walls off of their own boots.<br><br>Izzi, however, wasted no time.  &#8220;We move, now,&#8221; he commanded, and the party moved on down the hallway to the end.  When they reached the end, the room opened up into a hollowed out cave with something like a monument in the middle, a large torch burning in the center.  Two figures stood hunched near the torch, and Brim couldn&#8217;t make out the forms.  One of them emitted a low gurgle and pop that let Brim knew he was not up against anything he could recognize.<br><br>Izzi waved the group back into the corridor and signaled for them to go wait here.  The wizard cast an invisibility spell on himself and continued into the room towards the two figures.  Brim could see the sparkles of power from the spell fade out as he turned the corner to enter the room.  Moments later, Izzi returned and reappeared before them, his brow furrowed into that permanent thinking position as he reasoned out what he had just seen.<br><br>&#8220;Froglocks,&#8221; he began, &#8220;and lots of them.  Those two near the dais plus three more in the cavern at the other end of the room.  I could not tell for sure, but I one of them radiates the strands of power of a magic user.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Shamun,&#8221; interjected the big Ogre.  Jarnvid&#8217;s big head bobbed up and down in the affirmative to let Izzi know he was correct.  &#8220;Froggies sometime is caster froggies, an&#8217; dey have magics like Jarnvid.&#8221;  The Ogre would know, since the land of Guk was directly bordering his homeland, and Brim was sure that Jarnvid had slain his share of Froglocks.<br><br>Damn, thought Brim to himself.  Froglocks.  Never in his life did he ever think he would encounter such a menace.  He had once seen pictures of the frog-like men in the libraries back home during his studies of far off lands.  Now, not only was he in the far off land, he was about to encounter the beast from his studies first hand.  To think it was only a few short years ago.<br><br>&#8220;We&#8217;ll attack them head on, then,&#8221; Izzi surmised.  &#8220;There may be many, but they are the weaker tads of their race.  There should not be much trouble in defeating them.&#8221;<br><br>If there was one thing Brim had learned from his travels with the wizard - as well as from his cousin &#8211; when Izzi stated something wouldn&#8217;t be trouble, then he better be ready for trouble. (/ooc &#8211; Sorry Izz, but its true!  lol)<br><br>Brim blinked and looked around at his party members.  While in his thoughts, they had already begun to prepare for the battle.  Izzi and Gobo sat across from each other, cross-legged and flecks of power dashing in front of them. Jarnvid was crouched down one of his massive legs chanting something in his guttural Ogre language.  Brim&#8217;s Ogre was horrible, and he couldn&#8217;t make out any of the words used by the shaman.  Olwen had unsheathed his blade and laid it across his forearm.  The mighty blade seemed to shimmer in the half-lit hallway and the Paladin&#8217;s eyes fluttered open, then closed again.<br><br>Brim decided to ready himself and checked his spell book for the right illusion.  He found the one he was looking for and mouthed the words once to make sure he had them right.  He then closed the book and chanted in the arcane language of power and enchantments.  A green nimbus surrounded his hands and crept up his arms.  Slowly, the light flowed over his shoulders and down his chest cavity.  It finished surrounding him and ended off with a bright green pop, and Brim suddenly felt&#8230; different.<br><br>Izzi stood and looked at the form Brim had taken, and nodded at his choice.  Jarnvid swung his big head around and his eyes narrowed slightly, almost as if he could just see through the illusion, but not quite.  Brim surveyed himself and could see the form of the Earth Elemental looked satisfactory.  He also felt the form&#8217;s added strength, and welcomed it for the upcoming battle.<br><br>Brim watched the others prepare with their own magical enchantments and protections.  With all the light emitting from the spectacle, Brim was surprised that the Froglocks didn&#8217;t detect their presence much sooner.<br><br>After the group finished, Izzi signaled for silence.  He then explained that he would attract the attention of the Froglocks first, giving the rest of them time to form up.  &#8220;The two on the dais,&#8221; he began, &#8220;should be rather easy, and if we can avoid attracting the attention of the other three down the other hall, then we will survive with little or no damage.&#8221;<br>The other four nodded in agreement and then headed out, following Izzi to the room.  Olwen followed directly behind him, with Brim and Gobo next and Jarnvid to follow up in the rear.  Izzi motioned for a halt just before they entered into the room and frowned at what he saw next.  Of the three that were down the other corridor on the other side of the open area, two of them came into the room and up to the dais.  The third was no where to be found.<br><br>Izzi swore under his breath and Brim began to worry.  He looked to his other party members and could see the concern on their faces as well.  Izzi&#8217;s brows furrowed into their seemingly constant thinking state and he tried to reason out what to do next.  It became so quiet in the hall that Brim heard Jarnvid scratch at his oversized bottom.  He shook his head, but couldn&#8217;t help grin at the image that came up with the sound.<br><br>Izzi snapped out of his planning and motioned for Brim to come forward.  The enchanter had a feeling this would happen.  &#8220;All right, Brim,&#8221; encouraged Izzi, &#8220;it is all up to you now.  We need you to keep these over grown tadpoles suspended while we take them down one at a time.  Are you up for the challenge, friend?&#8221;<br><br>Brim took a deep breath.  He knew his limitations when it came to spell casting, but never had the Elf encountered a Froglock before.  Now he was faced with four of them and perhaps more coming.  &#8220;I do not know,&#8221; was the only answer Brim could summon.  The rest of the party members shuffled and sighed dejectedly at Brim&#8217;s disconcerting answer.<br><br>Izzi grabbed the enchanter by the shoulders and looked into his eyes.  &#8220;You must try, or we cannot survive otherwise,&#8221; he admitted.  Brim broke eye contact with the wizard and looked down at the floor.  He hated to be the one to lead the force into battle.  Once before, when he was younger and more hotheaded, he had tried a bravado move of attacking a creature head on, only to realize that if his Cleric cousin was not there to instantly heal him, he would have died.  Since then, he had adopted the more reserved and more careful approach to his adventuring, and it had kept him alive long enough to get here.  And now it looked like he was about to jeopardize that which he had been so cautious over.  <br><br>Brim stopped his musing, looked at the wizard and replied, &#8220;All right, if I must, then I will try.&#8221;<br><br>The Elf stepped out of the hallway and into the room, the rest of his party members behind him.  He reached down deep into the source of his magic and began to form the image of the spell in his mind.  He then sought the minds of the four Froglocks before him, each mind as individual as a snowflake, but similar in construction.  He could sense their primitive thoughts and was happy to learn that each of the minds before him could not resist the force of his mesmerize spell.  Brim waved his hands in the air and formed the illusion of mind control.  A purple and blue ball of power appeared at his will and he gathered the necessary energies for the spell.  He was amazed that none of the creatures looked up from whatever they were doing on the dais.<br><br>With a final wave of his hands, the enchanter sent the mind spell reeling towards the targets.  Three of the Froglocks stood frozen in place, but Brim felt his spell crumble like an egg on stone against the fourth.  The creature blinked in surprise, its large amphibious eyes locking on the enchanter.  It was Brim&#8217;s turn to blink in surprise as the Froglock let out a horrific sounding &#8220;Frrroooaaakkk!&#8221; and began to advance on him.<br><br>Impossible!  The creature had no where near the capabilities to resist the force of that spell.  Yet for some reason, the spell crumbled like stale bread.  Next, it whirled around and began to croak and pop in some odd, yet familiar language.  It was spell casting!  The Froglock Shaman!  No wonder his spell had no effect; the creature probably had some magical resistance spell cast upon itself.  A light blue and misted swirl of power crackled from the Froglock Shaman&#8217;s fingertips and began to grow into a powerful blast of energy.  Brim could hear his friends begin their own incantations, but they would not beat the Froglock to the punch.<br><br>The Shaman threw its hands forward and a frost beam erupted forward and slammed against Brim&#8217;s magical shields.  The effect actually knocked him back and he nearly lost his balance from the blast.  The Elf regained his composure and turned in time to see the Froglock Shaman erupt into a shower of sparks and fire.  Brim laughed to himself.  The creature could not withstand the effects of the two wizards and a shaman&#8217;s spells.  The Froglock sagged to the floor, a mass of charred, smoking flesh.<br><br>At the same moment, two of the other mesmerized Froglocks broke the enchantment and went rushing towards the source of that enchantment.  Brim searched his memory for a quick spell and thought of the perfect one.  He held his hands up, palms forward, and rattled off a quick verse.  Colored light erupted from the enchanter&#8217;s palms, blinding and temporarily stunning both of the Froglocks.  In seconds, Olwen was on one of the blinded creatures, effectively slashing and cutting it down in three deft movements.  Jarnvid went to the second and crushed it&#8217;s skull in an over-handed blow with the tremendous maul he had aptly named Gatorsmash.  <br><br>The wizards turned the last Froglock into a charred mess before it even broke the Enchanter&#8217;s first spell.  The battle was over as quick as it had begun.  Jarnvid trudged over to the nearest Froglock and picked it up by the legs.  The limp corpse of the creature hung like a child&#8217;s doll in the massive Ogre&#8217;s hands.  With little effort, he tore off one of its legs and took a bite out of the limb.  The crunch sent shivers through the rest of the party, and Jarnvid let out a satisfied, &#8220;Mmmmm,&#8221; followed by, &#8220;me luv froggy legs.  Dey gud when fresh.&#8221;<br><br>Brim resisted the urge to wretch, and he saw Gobo place his hand over his mouth looking rather pale.  The Ogre finished his meal and let out a thunderous belch.  Flecks of meat flapped from his lips and when he finished, he dropped the now clean leg bone and wiped his mouth on his arm.  &#8220;Ahhhh,&#8221; he sighed contentedly.  The group reformed and assessed their situation.<br><br>&#8220;All right, my friends,&#8221; Izzi began.  &#8220;Very well done.  But remember, these were only young Froglocks, and the older beasts will tear us to shreds if we are not careful.&#8221;  Brim noticed several of the companions nod at the statement, knowing that he was probably the only one who had never encountered the beasts before.  Once again, Brim was reminded of his inexperience around such veterans.<br><br>Gobo was peering down the hallway where the fifth Froglock was before, but he was unable to see anything down the dark corridor.  &#8220;Dark as the inside of a Hill Giant&#8217;s&#8230;&#8221; started the young wizard, but he thought better of his statement and cut himself off.  Brim grinned and rattled off his Ultravision spell that had always come in handy for his human friends when it got dark.  Gobo smiled at Brim and nodded his thanks.  &#8220;It would seem that the fifth creature has left the area, it would be safe to pursue.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Then let us move quickly,&#8221; replied Olwen. &#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t want this little event alerting the rest of the clan.&#8221;  With that Brim definitely agreed, and they moved on down the dark corridor to the next part of the cavern.  Brim was taking grand notice of the intricate carvings on the walls hat depicted great scenes, almost as if they were telling a story.  He stopped in front of one primitive looking scene trying to decipher what it may be.  Several green colored beings &#8211; obviously Froglocks &#8211; were standing around a pillar of fire, apparently in worship.<br><br>&#8220;The Coming of Great Power,&#8221; Izzi read from the picture.<br>Brim stared at the wizard and asked, &#8220;You can read this?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Not really,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;but the general idea is there.  I have studied primitive clan cultures of Norrathian species and they often use these hieroglyphics to tell stories of great happenings in their society.  This looks to be like the telling of a volcano erupting.&#8221;<br><br>Brim puzzled around the idea of a great event happening in the Froglock culture that would cause them to draw pictures on a wall, and a volcano would definitely be one of them.  &#8220;But the closest volcanic activity resides in Lavastorm, a land quite far from here,&#8221; responded Brim.  &#8220;How would they know of such an event?&#8221;<br><br>His response surprisingly came from Olwen.  &#8220;Do not presume, young enchanter, that the Froglocks were not once of the land you refer to as Lavastorm.  They are an old species on Norrath, and have much history within the lands.&#8221;<br><br>Brim crossed one arm over the other and tapped a finger on his chin in thought.  The idea that the Froglocks were that old of a society went against many of the teachings he had back in Felwithe.  Of course, since he had met with his current friends, many of the teachings he had received prior to leaving his homeland were now as silly as children&#8217;s tales, once again proving that no education was as good as a life experience.<br><br>&#8220;Let&#8217;s move,&#8221; interrupted Gobo.  &#8220;I would hate to be caught in this dark space with a horde of Froglocks at my back.&#8221;<br>&#8220;Agreed,&#8221; said Izzi.  &#8220;We must keep moving.&#8221;<br><br>They continued to the end of the hall and came around a corner into another large area.  This time the space was more like a pit, but there were stairs carved into the walls.  On the outer edge of the room on each side was a dark doorway.  At the bottom of the pit were another three Froglocks, dancing and chanting around another one of the daises like the one they encountered earlier.  The creature in the middle held an extended gold colored rod with a jagged top.  It wore a robe-like garment and between each set of chants would bang the rod on the ground for an emphatic effect to the chant.  Brim could swear he saw a blue image waver on top of the icon resting in the middle of the dais, but after shaking his head and blinking a few times saw nothing.<br><br>&#8220;Perfect,&#8221; gasped Izzi in what seemed like delight.  &#8220;That is what we came for.  I had not thought it would be so easy an item to attain, but there it is.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;We do not have it yet,&#8221; corrected the younger mage.<br>&#8220;We shall, my friend, you shall see.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Nuff talk, me hungry!&#8221; bellowed Jarnvid and he rushed into the room and stood at the edge of the open pit hefting his mighty maul into the air and whooping a deadly Ogre war cry.  The Froglocks were surprised only for a second before the one holding the rod gestured to the Ogre and garbled something unintelligible to his acolytes.  Both creatures crouched and then leapt incredibly high into the air and landed on either side of the Shaman.  They turned and started to move in slowly on the Ogre, obviously thinking the two would outnumber his one.<br><br>  The rest of the party poured into the pit area and went to the aid of their friend.  Brim noticed a red and purple nexus of power gather around Izzi.  It looked to Brim like Izzi was about to roast the two advancing on Jarnvid, but noticed that the wizard had another target in mind.<br><br>Gobo also started to wave his hands in a spiraling motion and circular flames appeared in the air in front of him.  Olwen had already reached the side of Jarnvid and now the two were back to back and prepared to take on the advancing Froglocks.  Izzi&#8217;s spell went off and Brim could feel the enormous force behind the magical attack, so much that it actually made a whoosh as it flew towards its intended target.  With blinding speed, the Froglock still in the pit spun the Golden Rod in a wide arc and deflected most of the magical attack.  Izzi blinked in surprise and Brim couldn&#8217;t help but gape.  A low gurgle emitted from the Froglock in the pit and he began to advance forward on the wizard.<br><br>Olwen and Jarnvid were trying to make quick work of the other two beasts, but these were undoubtedly tougher than the last bunch.  Brim saw Olwen misstep and take a blow across the shoulder.  The enchanter gathered some of his own magic and cast protective fire barrier around the Paladin.  The flames harmlessly enveloped him and the Froglock shied away from the increasing heat of the flames. In a movement like a blur, Olwen spun and lopped the creature&#8217;s head right from its shoulders.  He turned and grinned at Brim in the fashion that showed his gratitude.<br><br>Gobo managed to get off his spell and a spiral column of flame shot towards the second Froglock, slamming full force into the side of the beast.  It shook its head and turned on the young wizard.  Jarnvid seized the moment and dealt a crushing blow to its back with the full force of his maul.  Brim could hear the snap of the creature&#8217;s spine and see its eyes glaze over in death even before it crumpled to the ground in a heap.  Jarnvid&#8217;s black and yellow grin was enough to make even Brim smile.  Then he heard the explosion.<br><br>Brim turned to see Izzi standing a few yards from the last Froglock, his arms crossed defensively in front of him.  The creature twirled the Golden Rod and an eerie dark purple bubble of power formed and edged its way slowly towards Izzi.  The wizard somehow seemed to anticipate the attack and brought his crossed arms down in a chopping motion.  The dark bubble split in half twice and disintegrated.  The Froglock let out a rumble of a croak advanced on the Wizard, the Golden Rod held like a spear.  Brim desperately tried to think up a charm that would work on a Froglock, but could not come up with anything.  Instead he rattled of a quick spell designed to hamper the speed of an opponent. The Froglock turned towards Brim, moving like he was pushing through water.  Olwen easily walked up to the creature and plunged his sword into its skull.  It shuddered once and slumped to the group in a useless heap.<br><br>Once again, the battle went smoothly, if not as easy as their first.  Izzi walked directly over to the fallen Froglock holding the Golden Rod and kicked it onto its back.  &#8220;Brim,&#8221; he called, &#8220;come and take this from him.  If what I read about it is true, the Rod is a magical item that cannot pass between the living once possessed.&#8221;<br><br>Brim nodded and walked over to the corpse.  He had heard stories of magic items on Norrath that were enchanted so that they may not be passed from one to another, but rather formed a magical bond with the owner until its death.   Apparently this beast was the former owner of this item, and now it was to become his.<br><br>&#8220;I want you to hang on to that for now, &#8220;said Izzi.  Like I have a choice Brim thought to himself.  &#8220;I read in an ancient tome that it is one half of an ancient weapon designed to bond with the magical properties of an enchanter.  It was known as the Rod of Insidious Glamour, but was destroyed and the pieces were never found.  I learned of this one&#8217;s whereabouts from our big friend Jarnvid over there.&#8221;<br><br>At the mention of his name, Jarnvid gave a toothy grin and said, &#8220;Me watch froggies do dat sing an&#8217; dance an&#8217; me tell Izz &#8216;bout dem.  He say we come gets dem froggies, so me waited ta eat dem.  Now me have lunch.&#8221;  And the big Ogre did just that, eating another pair of Froglock legs while the team planned their next move.<br><br>Izzi filled them in on some of the history of the Caverns of Guk, explaining some of the believed origins of the Froglocks, and how it is believed they came to find these caverns in the first place.  Brim listened intently to the history lesson, the whole time wondering if there was anything the Wizard didn&#8217;t know about.  He seemed to have a vast knowledge of Norrath&#8217;s history and creatures, as well as speculation and factual information on all accounts.  Brim was starting to understand why his cousin liked and respected the Wizard so much and had insisted that he study with the scholar. <br><br>&#8220;Izzi,&#8221; Interrupted Olwen from the other side of the room.  &#8220;I do not mean to be rude and disturb your lesson, but the less time we stay there, the better I will feel.&#8221;  The Paladin&#8217;s eyes shifted from left to right to accentuate his unease.<br><br>Izzi only nodded and walked to the doorway on the left and motioned for the others to follow.  They walked single file down long and dark corridors for what seemed like hours.  Sometime later, when Brim&#8217;s thoughts began to drift off, the nearly crashed into Gobo, who had stopped directly in front of him.  He peered around the young wizard and saw that Izzi had found another room, this one had a more eerie presence about it.  Brim couldn&#8217;t put his finger on it, but something was definitely not right.  Izzi motioned for silence and waved everyone to follow.  Reluctantly, the others complied.<br><br>They entered into a room that resembled other caverns in Guk, but this one was very different.  The walls had a glowing sheen that seemed to ooze rather than radiate light.  There were large web-like structures along the ceiling connecting to long columns of rock that jutted out of the floor like teeth.  Brim noticed quite a few stray bones lying on the floor, some of them seemed quite large.  Jarnvid reached out and pulled on one of the stray webs attached to a stone column.  Izzi saw the Ogre reach for it and yelled &#8220;NO!&#8221; but not before he pulled on the web and gave the wizard a quizzical look.<br><br>Something large and black dropped from the ceiling, knocking into Brim and tossing him aside easily.  He rolled over just in time to see a spider almost as large as Jarnvid advancing on him.  The creature was easily eight feet across its leg span and its menacing glare fixed on the enchanter.  Brim tried to scurry backwards, but the spider was quick and was on him instantly.  The spider sank its fangs deep into the Elf&#8217;s leg, and Brim felt burning sensations shoot up his leg, a fire of unspeakable pain.  His scream echoed throughout the walls of Guk.<br><br>Poison! He thought to himself. Spiders were known to be poisonous arachnids, but hardly enough to do any damage to a full sized Elf.  Except this was no ordinary spider.  Brim managed to roll over and scurry along the floor, trying to claw his way from the beast.  Brim heard the unsheathing of a blade and a large thud, but was having a hard time focusing his vision.  He then felt more than saw a magic blast of power explode only a few feet from him and knew that Izzi had unleashed a full force attack on the beast.  Another burst of power followed right behind his, and this time Brim could sense the power radiate from Gobo.<br><br>A tremendous squeal emitted from the spider and the sound of clashing steel.  Olwen was making his advance on the beast but from his grunting Brim could tell he wasn&#8217;t getting very far.  He tried to shake the blurring vision and stand, but was only just able to sit up.  This monster&#8217;s poison was strong, and it was infecting him fast.<br><br>A guttural sound followed by another wave of magic and Brim knew that the Ogre had just cast one of his own spells on the spider.  Brim could hear the magical buzzing of the insect spell the shaman cast and the spider squealed anew, the sound penetrating Brim&#8217;s head and making him even more lightheaded.  Brim heard a final clang followed by a gurgling squeal and knew that Olwen had scored the final deathblow on the spider.  He grinned, but was beginning to think he did so because the lightheadedness was effecting him.<br><br>Brim heard some talking, but had trouble making out the words.  &#8220;&#8230;help him quickly&#8230;  poisoned.&#8221;  That sounded like it may have been Izzi, or Gobo, but Brim couldn&#8217;t make out the fuzzy sounding voice too clearly.  Two extremely large hands lifted him like a helpless newborn and set him up against a rock.  Brim felt close to blacking out, but convinced himself that he needed to stay awake.  A low guttural chant and an eerie green light exuded in front of him.  Brim could remember hearing something like it once before, but he was uncertain where.<br><br>Suddenly Brim felt a rush of energy surge through him, hot then cold, then hot again.  He started to sweat and then shiver and felt he would shake so hard he may fall apart.  A voice near him said he should be all right, but Brim wasn&#8217;t so sure.  He slumped to the ground, his vision returning slowly.  Another wave of power washed over him, this time warming and comforting.  Brim recognized the healing spell drift over him and his strength returned anew.  His eyes fluttered open, and he jerked up, not even realizing he had them close.  When his eyes came into focus, he was face to face with Jarnvid&#8217;s huge yellow and black toothed grin.<br><br>Resisting his urge to jump in fear, Brim shook his head to clear out the last of the dizziness.  Slowly, he stood up and noticed all of his friends standing around him and looking intently to see if he was all right.  &#8220;Thank you, my big friend,&#8221; he said to the Ogre.  &#8220;I owe you a debt of gratitude.&#8221;<br><br>The big Ogre shook his head and frowned.  &#8220;No, fren Brim.  We is frens an&#8217; frens help each udder.  You no need tank Jarnvid for ting he do frum frenship.&#8221;<br><br>Brim couldn&#8217;t help but smile, and noticed the others smiling as well.  Jarnvid didn&#8217;t have a way with words, but he definitely was honest and got his point across.  Something that too few people did these days, and Brim welcomed the honesty.  He extended his hand and clasped that of the Ogre, only grimacing slightly from the powerful grip and vigorous shake he received in return.<br><br>&#8220;Well, I think our friend Brim will recover,&#8221; said Izzi, &#8220;so let us get moving.  We are almost to our destination.&#8221;<br><br>Brim fixed his robes, now stained with some of his blood and the venom injected by the spider.  He went to a nearby puddle and carefully washed off the excess venom.  He also noticed that he had lost his illusion of the Earth Elemental, but decided not to renew it and conserve his energies.  He then rejoined the others and they continued into the hallway and on to the next oversized cavern.<br><br>They all entered into an open area that was hard to distinguish from many of the other areas they had been in so far, the walls having the same look as many other rooms.  The only difference Brim noted was a painting of dead Froglocks on the far wall to the left next to an opening to another corridor.  Izzi was studying the drawing, his finger rhythmically tapping his chin in thought.<br><br>Izzi turned to his companions and had a worried look on his face.  This concerned Brim since he had never witnessed the wizard in such a state. He noticed his companions with a similar concern and knew it obviously meant some sort of great danger.  The enchanter was about to ask what he had discovered, but Gobo beat him to the punch.<br><br>&#8220;A graveyard of some sort?&#8221; he pondered.  The others looked at Izzi and saw the confirmation in his eyes.  Brim wondered why a graveyard had worried the wizard so.<br><br>As if the wizard had read his mind, he spoke, &#8220;Ordinarily graveyards would not concern me in the slightest.&#8221;  He paced across the floor and his fingers massaged his temples.  Brim could tell he was remembering some long ago studied information.  The wizard went on.  &#8220;However, in this case, I believe we have trouble.  Froglocks are a very superstitious species.  Some of them believe they are meant to be immortal, others believe they are reincarnated and brought back in a new life.  Different clans pose different beliefs.  This symbol,&#8221; he gestured to the drawing to his right, &#8220;is representative of the Zok Clan.  They are known necromancers and are feared greatly by the other clans with much reason.  I have a bad feeling that&#8230;&#8221;<br><br>As if the words had sparked the action, a low and eerie croak came from one of the hallways.  A wind burst through the room bringing the chill and stink of death with it.  Each of the party members backed up a step or two, eyes wide at the noise that emanated from within the corridor.  Something made a hiss and sounded as if it was slithering down the hall.  It let loose another gurgling croak and stepped into the room.  What they witnessed was nothing like what they expected.<br><br>The Froglock&#8217;s skin was a darker green, almost gray, than a normal Froglock.  Parts of its flesh were torn away or missing all together, exposing many bones.  Its skull looked as though it had been caved in at one point, and one of its eyes had a nasty gash in it where it oozed some type of yellow puss.  Each party member stared is disbelief and he even heard Olwen mutter, &#8220;&#8230;Mother of All&#8230;&#8221;<br><br>The Undead creature reared its head back in challenge and let out a mighty &#8220;Frrroooaaakk!&#8221;  It then sprang forward towards its nearest target, namely Gobo.  The young wizard started to bring up a spell, but the Froglock reached him and easily swatted him aside.  Gobo flew into the wall behind him and slumped down unconscious.  Jarnvid threw his hammer up into the air issuing his own challenge and the Froglock stopped in his tracks and turned towards the Ogre.<br><br>Jarnvid waved his arms in a peculiar motion and they ignited with a misty blue light.  The light grew and grew, and soon enveloped his entire body.  He then threw his arms out to the side and then flung both of them forward.  Large pellets of hail scattered across the Froglock, and though they could be seen hitting his body, the beast seemed to hardly notice the fist-sized balls of ice.  Brim could swear that the creature was actually smiling.<br><br>Brim sought the monster&#8217;s mind and wove his hands into the pattern to bring down its magical resistance.  It did little, and the creature started its advance on Jarnvid.  The Ogre began another spell, but the Froglock sprang forward at blurring speed and stuck the Ogre in his huge gut.  He doubled over in pain, clutching his stomach and gasping for air.<br><br>Another burst of power exploded across the Froglock&#8217;s back and sent him sprawling into the nearest wall.  Brim turned and saw the residual fluxes of power emanating from Izzi&#8217;s fingers.  Brim was certain that same blast might have felled a Hill Giant.  Brim looked back over to the Froglock and saw it spring back to its feet.  The creature gave a low croak, obviously angry and preparing to launch itself at the wizard.  Just as it was about to leap into action a bloodthirsty war cry pierced the room as Olwen sprang into action.<br><br>Olwen collided with the Froglock, hacking at it with the ferocity of an animal.  The beast retaliated with a blow of its own which Olwen easily absorbed on his shield.  The paladin swept around and feinted stabbing low at the beasts&#8217; gut, then spun his sword into a massive over-handed swing.  The beast was fooled and Olwen&#8217;s sword struck home, embedding deep in the Froglock&#8217;s shoulder.  He ripped the sword from the creature&#8217;s shoulder and black ooze seeped from the new wound.  The Undead creature only stared at its new slash and turned its gaze back to Olwen, who was beginning to pant with his effort to keep the beast at bay.<br><br>Brim tried to think of something he could do, and then had an idea.  He reached into his pack and pulled out two miniscule little daggers, knives too small for combat.  He held them in his open palm and waved his other hand over them, beginning his incantation.  Yellow sparks flew from his fingertips and the daggers spun out of his hands, landing on the floor.  The daggers were glowing and began to grow.  They then changed shape until a sword and shield were lying on the ground.  Another chant from the Elf, and the weapons lifted from the ground, waiting to spring into action at the enchanter&#8217;s command.  Brim hated the part that came next.<br><br>Olwen was holding his own with the Froglock, but looked to be getting tired (Brim could imagine the sword and shield he was wielding must be heavy).  The Elf pulled out his own dagger and crept up behind the beast, attempting to take a stab at him.  The Undead menace must have seen Brim coming because in one deft motion the beast spun and gave a crushing blow to the enchanter&#8217;s temple.  The punch knocked Brim back, dazed and barely holding on to consciousness.  Brim&#8217;s pet vaulted into action.  In it&#8217;s own hollow voice the pet shouted, &#8220;Taunting attacker, Master,&#8221; and the floating sword and shield became a dizzying flash of steel, hacking and slicing at the Froglock.  The beast&#8217;s surprise quickly turned to anger as it tried to fight off an attacker it could not see.  It swung at the enchanted pet, sometimes landing a blow on the shield, sometimes passing through empty air.  Brim&#8217;s pet was failing fast, but for what happened next, it was worth the distraction.<br><br>Olwen, seeing the distraction, took his opportunity while he had the chance.  He hefted his mighty sword in both hands and it seemed to take on an eerie bluish purple glow.  Brim felt the power of the sword begging to be used.  His eyes widened in surprise at the sudden surge from the blade.  He had felt the same surge of power from his cousin when he was battling with his Cleric cousin against the Undead that occasionally plagued the forests of Faydwer.  Brim suddenly remembered that the sword Olwen used was no ordinary sword.  It was enchanted with powerful spells against Undead creatures.  Brim had heard the paladin refer to it as Ghoulbane, a perfect name for such a powerful weapon.<br><br>Olwen swung his mighty blade overhead and let it fall into the creature&#8217;s neck.  The sword erupted into a fiery blue and purple blast of energy and sliced deeply into its spine.  The Undead Froglock grasped the sword, which had sunken as far in as its chest, shuddered once and fell to its knees.  Olwen placed his boot on its back and ripped his blade free with a clang of metal.  The beast collapsed forward and after a few twitches finally ceased moving.  Olwen sagged and leaned heavily against the nearest wall panting with exertion.<br><br>Brim clung to the growing bruise on his head and closed his eyes to the massive headache forming.  Izzi was helping Gobo, who had just regained consciousness and was sitting up with his hands cradling his head.  Jarnvid climbed to his feet and shook off the remaining effects of the blow to the gut.  &#8220;Dat Froggie hurt Jarnvid!&#8221; he exclaimed.<br><br>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Izzi, &#8220;He was tough, but we defeated him.  Very good word Sir Olwen.&#8221;  The grin flashed to Olwen from the wizard was warm and full of thanks.<br><br>&#8220;&#8217;Twas my pleasure, Sir Wizard,&#8221; replied Olwen, and he bowed graciously.  Brim tried to hide his grin, but felt the need to laugh more than anything.  &#8220;And you, Enchanter,&#8221; and the tone of his voice was full of respect, &#8220;that was quite a trick with that distraction.  It helped keep the beast from me long enough to strike the killing blow.  Good thinking.&#8221;  The paladin walked up to Brim and gave him a good solid pat on the back.  The enchanter nearly fell forward from the force of the blow.  That gave them all a good laugh.  <br><br>Until the heard the grumble.<br>At once, all five companions turned towards the hallway.  More of the scraping and croaking came from the corridor, and the same eerie chill followed.  This time, however, it sounded like a whole group of Froglocks, and most likely more of the Zol clan.  Olwen turned to Izzi and hissed, &#8220;Get us out of here, now!&#8221;<br><br>The wizard had already begun his chanting and that familiar nexus of power began to grow around him.  At the same time four more Undead Froglocks emerged from the hallway and roared a croak of anger at the party.  The five members of At Fates Hands gathered around the wizard and watched as the monsters started to advance on them.  Izzi&#8217;s hands came down and Brim saw the shimmering portal of blazing energy envelope him just before the Froglocks were upon them.<br><br>*****<br><br>The Greater Faydark&#8230;  Brim blinked as he was mystically dropped off in the Forest of the Elves, happy to be home and in a safe place.  He looked up and saw the giant spires built centuries ago by ancient wizards for use as a focal point for teleportation.  Brim looked around at his friends and saw they were all safe and sounds, and he breathed a sigh of relief.  Jarnvid was glancing around nervously, and Brim was reminded that he was in a land where Ogres were seldom seen and almost never welcome.<br><br>Izzi noticed his discomfort and assured him, &#8220;Fear not my large friend, you are safe with us.  No one here in the Faydark will harm you in our company.&#8221;  The Ogre nodded, but he did not seem to be at ease.<br><br>Gobo looked around and asked, &#8220;The Faydark?&#8221; Why are we here Izzi?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;He has come to see us,&#8221; came the reply from the trees.<br><br>The group members turned towards the sound of the voice and saw several figures emerge from the woods, broad swords brandished and at the ready.  From the look of their weapons and armor, these were the mighty High Elf Paladins of Felwithe.  They were an impressive bunch, a mix of males and females all appeared to have their combat gear on.  Brim had remembered encountering them many times, and even having a few friends within their guild.  The leader, however, was none other than General Jyleel himself.<br><br>&#8220;Good to see you again, Sir Wizard,&#8221; boomed the General.  His voice was strangely low for a High Elf, and his muscled frame was nearly twice that of the frail Brim.  On closer examination, the General resembled Olwen in stature.  If Brim hadn&#8217;t known any better, he&#8217;d have though the two were cousins.<br><br>&#8220;And you General,&#8221; responded Izzi.  &#8220;I take it that you await our news?&#8221;<br>&#8220;I do, yes, and I can see from the look of your ragged and shaken adventurers it is not good news that I will here.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;None too good I am afraid.  The Zol Knights are surfacing again.&#8221;<br>At the mention of the name, the General&#8217;s face darkened into apparent rage.  &#8220;Zol Knights,&#8221; he spat, &#8220;are unholy monsters.  They could not possibly have resurfaced.  My men made sure their taint was wiped clean from Norrath years ago.&#8221;<br><br>Izzi gave no reply, only stoically looked the General in the eyes and the High Elf let out a lengthy sigh and said, &#8220;But I know you not to be a liar, Sir Wizard, and you have been a great service to the Elves of Felwithe.  I will take a detachment into the caverns of Guk and route them out once again, for good.  Thank you, again, all of you for your service.&#8221;<br><br>The general bowed to each one of the companions, even Jarnvid, who he only glowered at dubiously.  Jarnvid gave the General a toothy grin, and Brim saw several of the Paladins betray a smile in return.  Even Jyleel&#8217;s mouth twisted into a small grin before he spoke his final words, &#8220;Fare thee well, comrades.  May you live to have many adventures.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;We will General.  Our blessings to you.&#8221;<br><br>As the Elves sprinted off back into the forest, Izzi turned to his companions and asked with a mischievous grin, &#8220;So, what shall we do next, my friends?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Let&#8217;s head to Freeport,&#8221; responded Olwen.  &#8220;I know the best bar just outside the Eastern gate&#8230;&#8221;<br><br><br>fin

<P>
Blair gazed intently at nothingness,  his mind digesting the latest developments at Crushbone.  Blair&#8217;s skill in the art of Necromancy was unparalleled by anyone in Neriak.  As a side effect,  Blair aged much quicker than his fellow Dark Elves.  Although Blair was only twelve years old,  he resembled an elf in his early twenties.   Because Blair found that the power of Necromancy flowed naturally in his veins,  he dedicated more and more time to the art of melee combat.  In the past few months,  Blair&#8217;s skill with a sword rivaled the best of warriors Neriak had to offer.  The capture of young Darien Sleighhill had come earlier than expected.   In Blair&#8217;s opinion,  the defenses of Freeport had not been weakened enough.   The Trolls and Ogres would suffer much heavier casualties than expected during the second phase of Lord Nafagen&#8217;s plan.   <br><br>&#8220;The Trolls and Ogres will be severely weakened.&#8221;  Blair noted to his fellow Dark Elves.  &#8220;It may not be wise to proceed at this point.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Would you like to be the one to inform Lord Nafagen that we have failed to execute his plan,   Lord D&#8217;eewlay?&#8221;  snarled Krast Ka&#8217;Pappan,  a skilled shadow knight.<br><br>&#8220;Mind who you speak to!&#8221;  snapped Tralon D&#8217;eewlay.   Although Tralon and Aerual D&#8217;eewlay were Blair&#8217;s parents and were well respected Necromancers in Neriak,  they knew better than to cross their son.  Fortunately for Krast Ka&#8217;Pappan,   Blair was feeling merciful this day<br><br>&#8220;I never said that we have failed,  Lord Ka&#8217;Pappan.   Lord Nafagen&#8217;s plan simply needs to be adjusted.  I will speak with him alone.   All of you,  leave my presence.&#8221;<br><br>The Dark Elves left single file out of the Lodge of the Dead.   Blair sat alone.   What would he tell Lord Nafagen?   Taking a deep breath,  Blair prepared to contact the Dragon Lord.<br><br>Darien Sleighhill felt the mana flow through his veins as he continued to heal Eralyn.  The cell the orc placed the two elves in was damp and bleak.  It had no windows and little chance of escape.  Escape was not the immediate concern on Darien&#8217;s mind at the moment however.  Slowly but surely,  Eralyn&#8217;s life force continued to strengthen.  Had Eralyn&#8217;s wounds been more severe,  Darien could not have helped her.  Slowly,  Eralyn began to regain consciousness.<br><br>&#8220;Where am I?&#8221;  Eralyn groaned.  &#8220;What is happening?&#8221;<br><br>Eralyn struggled to get on her feet, and instinctively clutched at her ribs and winced in pain.<br><br>&#8220;Do not try to move.  You are badly wounded.&#8221;  Darien said with concern.  &#8220;We are in Crushbone and in a lot of trouble.  Do you remember anything?&#8221;<br><br> Eralyn closed her eyes and tried to think.<br><br>&#8220;I remember being attacked by an orc.  You helped me,  then you were hurt.   No more&#8230;&#8221;   Eralyn gasped through the pain.  &#8220;What do we do now?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;  Darien answered truthfully.<br><br>&#8220;I&#8217;m scared Darien.&#8221;  Eralyn whispered.<br><br>Darien wanted to tell Eralyn that everything would be alright.   That they would be home soon for supper,  or that this was all just a bad dream.   Unfortunately,  it was not a dream.  It was all too real.  Darien would not lie to Eralyn and tell her everything would be okay when he didn&#8217;t know what was in store for them<br><br>&#8220;So am I.&#8221;  Darien finally replied.<br><br>	Lord Nafagen listened with keen ears as Lord D&#8217;eewlay informed him on the latest of news in Faydark.    Lord Nafagen&#8217;s plan to conquer the Eastern portion of Norrath hit its first obstacle in what seemed like a flawless plan.    Lord Nafagen had to exercise all of his self-control to keep from lashing out at the Dark Elf.   Lord D&#8217;eewlay wondered himself if it was so wise for him to travel to the dragon&#8217;s lair in person.  Perhaps he should have used magical communication.<br><br>&#8220;Lord D&#8217;eewlay.  You were a fool to trust those incompetent Crushbone Orcs.&#8221;  Lord Nafagen growled.<br><br>&#8220;They have their uses,  my lord.&#8221;  Blair said in the most humblest of tones.  Even the mighty Necromancer could not stand toe to toe versus the great wyrm Nafagen alone.   <br><br>&#8220;We must attack now then.&#8221;  Lord Nafagen concluded.  &#8220;The trolls and ogres will just have to fight harder to conquer Freeport.  Prepare to ransom off the Sleighhill boy.&#8221;<br><br>Lord D&#8217;eewlay  gazed upon the dragon for a moment, his mind racing.   There had to be a way to keep their army stronger for their invasion of Faydwer.<br><br>&#8220;With all due respect,  mighty Lord Nafagen.  May I suggest an alternative course of action?&#8221;  Blair asked.<br><br>The Dragon lord listened as Blair D&#8217;eewlay outlined his new sinister plan on how to reach Faydark with their forces intact.<br><br>	Jeyna Sleighhill sat by the fire in her chambers alone.   Darien was late for dinner yet again.  Jeyna had decided to give her son an earful when he returned home.  Any minute now,  Darien would come running through the door,  a happy playful mess as he always did.   Any minute now&#8230;  Jeyna had told herself that for the last hour,  and there was no sign of Darien.   Darien&#8217;s dinner was long cold now.  Suddenly,  there was a knock on the Sleighhill door.  It wasn&#8217;t like Darien to knock.  Jeyna rose from her chair and answered the door,  fully expecting Darien to be standing on the other side.<br><br>&#8220;Young elfling,  you better have a good explanation&#8230;&#8221;  Jeyna started.   At the door was an elven messenger.  <br><br>&#8220;Lady Sleighhill.  An emergency session of the council has been called.   You presence is required.&#8221;  The messenger said.  Jeyna&#8217;s heart sank as she somehow felt some terrible misfortune had befallen her son.   She immediately rushed out of her house with speed and made her way to the council room.<br><br>	The mood in the council room was gloomy as Ambassador D&#8217;vinn  listed off his demands in exchange for the release of Darien Sleighhill.   Included in those demands were two million platinum to be forwarded to Neriak,  and the withdrawal of all elven forces in Freeport.   As the telecommunications portal closed,  the council was more silent as it has ever been in a millennium.   The silence was to be broken by the quiet sobs of Jeyna Sleighhill.<br><br>Meanwhile,  back in Crushbone,  D&#8217;vinn was very satisfied with what had just occurred.   He knew very well that the elves would not give into his demands.   He was counting on that.   In fact,  he was hoping more reinforcements would be sent to Freeport.  He sat in his chair and turned to Darien Sleighhill,  who was being restrained by two orc legionnaires.<br><br>&#8220;Soon,  my young friend.  The elven council will fall,  and all your people will die.  If you are fortunate enough,  you will live to see the beginnings of the new order.&#8221;  D&#8217;vinn remarked.<br><br>&#8220;You fiend.   My mother will never give into your demands.  Your plan,  whatever it is will fail.&#8221;  Darien spat back.<br><br>Ambassador D&#8217;vinn rose from his chair,  and swiftly delivered a backhand across the face of Darien.   Darien fell to the ground.   <br><br>&#8220;Stop it!&#8221;  Eralyn screamed.   She too,  was restrained by two orc legionaries.<br><br>D&#8217;vinn went over to Eralyn,  and backhanded her as well.  She fell to the ground and began to cry<br><br>Darien noticed this and the anger grew in him.  It seemed to him in the last few days that Eralyn had given up all hope.  Darien knew that D&#8217;vinn had no intention of releasing them.   He could not wait for his mother to come rescue him.   Darien looked around,  the legionnaires were laughing.  D&#8217;vinn was not paying attention,  now was his chance.  With one quick motion,  he lunged for the sheath of a legionnaire and stole his sword.  He quickly slashed the legionnaire across the midsection,  spilling his intestines.   D&#8217;vinn turned around just in time to see this.<br><br>&#8220;Stop him!&#8221;  D&#8217;vinn screamed.<br><br>The remaining three legionnaires closed in on young Darien,  who maintained a defensive position.   Darien had his back to a wall.  On the wall was the single lantern that provided light to the room they were in.  Darien turned around and struck the lantern with all his might.  The room became pitch black.  The only ones who could now see were the elves in the room.  Darien quickly made his way to Eralyn and grabbed her by the arm<br><br>&#8220;Come on!&#8221;  Darien urged.<br><br>Darien pulled Eralyn to her feet and they bolted for the door.   Only one thing stood in their way,   D'vinn.   Darien slashed at D&#8217;vinn,  who dodged the attack.  D&#8217;vinn countered by attempting to pierce Darien with his dagger,  but Darien saw the counter coming and parried the attack.   Eralyn then intervened by giving D&#8217;vinn a swift kick in the groin,  and D&#8217;vinn dropped like a sack of potatoes to the ground.   Darien and Eralyn bolted out the door and searched for a way out of Crushbone,  leaving D&#8217;vinn and the orcs behind in a pitch black room of total chaos.

IN THE COMPANY OF WOE, Part One<br>by Lane Boyd (boyd@io.com)<br>Copyright April, 2000<P>The bridges of Kelethin vexed Wigglewood. They were arduous in the bright of day -- or rather, the dimness of day, as the sun never saw the floor of the misty northern Faydark woods -- but in the rain, they were slippery and swayed with the wind. Built high up in massive conifer trees, the city was series of platforms, perfect protection for the wood elves against the enemies roaming the land down below. But for a halfling born in a hole in the ground, it was trial of nerves versus will. And today it was raining.</P><P><IMG SRC="/eqshots/Image1.jpg" WIDTH=181 HEIGHT=181 align=right>Nyaleen held her hands over his head, attempting in vain to keep the halfing remotely dry. "Thanks anyway," he said, crossing the last bridge between their sleeping quarters to the nearest tavern. "But I&#8217;m already a river. Lord Karana hates me." </P><P>Entering the small wooden house with the twin, overflowing mugs painted above the door, they welcomed the warmth of the fire burning along one wall, and the shelf of bottled drinks occupying the other. Chattering customers filled a few of the tables and most of the chairs, paying no attention to the pair. "I think it's rained every day since I&#8217;ve been here," Wigglewood said. He shook himself off and let Nyaleen take his backpack. </P><P><IMG SRC="/eqshots/Image2.jpg" WIDTH=181 HEIGHT=181 align=right></P><P>At the counter, he bought a bottle of gnomish spirits from the mug-washing bartender and ordered a plate of cheese and bread. He looked around for signs of other available treats. "Is there any Mulberry pie, today?" </P><P>The bartender flipped the wet towel over his arm. "Sold the last piece not two customers ago," he said, indifferently returning his attention to the mugs, filing them in a space under the bar.</P><P>The halfling shuffled to the fireplace, glum. Mulberry was the only pie he really liked. It seemed to him that someone, an enemy for certain, was always one step ahead, buying up the best of the local delicacies, the lack of which was acerbated by the general wood elf reluctance to open a decent shop at ground level.</P><P>Nyaleen, however, was more glum than he. She was young and fire-hearted, but the onus of habitual battle wasn't an enemy she could slay and be done with. Her olive skin, once youthful, was etched with the weight of accountability. She was not soft; she was fierce. Nature didn't commune with her as it did with her brethren. She was the product of an increasingly militant race, obligated not to the forests and the animals that inhabit them, but to the weapons she could find to defend herself. Wigglewood passed her the cheese and poured her a glass of the drink. He exaggerated a sigh and was about to begin a denunciation of the bartender, when Nyaleen spoke first.</P><P>"I haven't heard from my contact in Neriak for months," she said. "I want you to go to the Common Lands, find him, see what trouble he's making or whatever it is he's gotten into."</P><P>Wigglewood swallowed the entirety of his glass and searched absently for his pipe in his many pockets. Or perhaps something to smoke once he found it. "You hired a Tier'Dal," he said, distracted. "Dark elves likes trouble. What do you care?"</P><P>"I hired him to keep me informed, but with his chronic lapses, I know less now that I did when I worked alone."</P><P>The halfling stopped the searching, fruitless. The pipe was as gone today as it was yesterday and the day before that. He needed to remember to buy a new one, or at least remember that the old one was missing. "I'm not so sure I want to go to the Common Lands,&quot; he said. &quot;I haven't done anything here except be your personal merchant. I want to look around, have a go at these orcs you fight so much. You know battles I've fought? Spiders and bats and other belly-to-the-ground things. Boring. You can't pay me enough to keep me from my own training any longer."</P><P>"I don't pay you at all."</P><P>"Harumph. Certainly you don't. I'm a merchant. I earn my own way." He folded and unfolded his arms, then sat on the stool next to the fire without returning her stare. She sat as she always did, cross-legged on the wooden floor a few feet away, ignoring his wry tone. Wigglewood scratched his forehead. "Sorry, Ny, but being an amateur trader in city full of professionals is more than frustrating. It's ridiculous."</P><P>"I know it is," she said. "You're a priest of Lord Bristlebane and you should be memorizing your devotions. So why not catch the next ship to Freeport? You can make a pilgrimage to Rivervale. I'll handle the sells."</P><P>He snorted and lifted a hunk of cheese from the plate on the eave of the fireplace. "So you say, concerned warrior," he said, biting and chewing and talking at the same time. He paused to swallow and brush crumbs from his fingers. "Here's what I think you mean to say: To hell with Neriak, go find your sister Rendi, make sure she's safe in her woodland retreat, but don't tell her you've asked after her. Don't tell her you're worried that we haven't heard from her since she left. Don't tell her you mope around the woods instead of finishing your training. Your peers have all earned their surname, but not you, not yet. Rendi doesn't need to know that, right?"</P><P>Nyaleen stood at the unexpected scolding, anger abruptly contorting her face. The halfling twitched, not the least reassured that her weapons were sheathed and stored in her bags. He shied away from her when she moved toward him, but it was only the beginning of a fretful pace, trapped between Wigglewood, the fireplace, and the wall of the tavern.</P><P>The halfling leaned forward, bracing his elbows on his knees and chin on the palm of his wide hands. She was troubled, and not by an absent sibling. "Why don't you go to Freeport instead of me?" he offered</P><P>She wrung her hands together uncharacteristically. The firelight shone red over her forehead, drawing sharp shadows over her black hair and into the corners of her eyes. "I can't leave Faydwar right now, friend. As you said, I haven't completed my training, but you're wrong that I'm not working on it. I have been, just slowly."</P><P>"There's no reason you can't finish your training elsewhere. Warriors are needed in every land."</P><P>She shook her head. "I'm an Emerald Warrior. What I started here, I will finish." She gnawed at her bottom lip. "That, and I've been having bad dreams. Not the kind when I'm sleeping, but when I'm fighting, a hit takes me down and I'm out. I wake up in a nightmare, where I'm here, back home, a naked soul, alone and far from my body. I'm compelled to race against a demon, a malicious demon, to find my body before he swipes it away to the hells. I run and I run until I find it." She brushed her hair back from where it fell wetly in her face. "Each time I regain my body, there's a small part of me that's been lost forever, as if it's been wiped away and I have to live that part of my life over again. And each time I fall in battle, the nightmare is worse, the lost part of me even greater."</P><P>Wigglewood nodded. He pointed to her cobolt blue armor. "Is that why you accepted the expensive centaur armor from one of your warrior friends? I was told that it's awarded only to those who have earned it."</P><P>"I'm alive," she snorted. She returned to her seat on the floor with a metallic thud. "I consider it earned."</P><P>The halfling flushed. She was reaching out and he answered with a slap to an open wound. He obviously wasn't the first to question the armor, prized even in the merchant circles. That would have to be an issue resolved on another day. He clapped his hands together. "No sense in sticking around Kelethin if there's no mulberries," he said. He shouldered his worn leather backpack and took a deep breath to get her attention off the floor. When she looked up, he gave her a grin. "And I'll have to get some supplies if I'm going on a trip."</P><P ALIGN="CENTER">***</P><P>Rain continued to fall. The small drops forced a path through the forest's canopy, splattering against the leaves, making it worse for the travelers, the spray of water flicking unexpectedly in their eyes, blurring their vision. Wigglewood held the rope handles tightly and never looked down. He was raised in a hole. Only birds should live so high.</P><P>The platform headquarters of the Emerald Warriors was hidden among the branches of the giant trees. The canopy here was thick and broad, shielding those underneath from the storm god's blessing. In the torchlight, he could see tankards of ale being passed along the rows of gnarled men and lovely women. Weather like this was kind to neither beauty nor beast.</P><P><IMG SRC="/eqshots/Image3.jpg" WIDTH=193 HEIGHT=193 align=right></P><P>Opening the door and shoving themselves in from out of the rain, they found the headquarters filled with soldiers. Most were busy in the back room, where a merchant patiently traded coins for the goods that filled the shelves. The front room contained a single desk, the official residence of the soldiers' high commander. His name was Regren, and if he wasn&#8217;t the most official wood elf Wigglewood had ever seen, he was at least the most silver. His platemail alone was impossible not to respect.</P><P>Nyaleen hailed the commander. He stood as she approached. "Sire, this is my associate, Wigglewood, a cleric of Bristlebane Fizzlethorp."</P><P>The halfling smiled wanly at the man, vaguely uncomfortable at being regarded as a holy man. He bowed slightly. "Really, I'm just here on vacation," he said.</P><P>"This is hardly a place for vacation," the commander replied, returning the bow. "But it's just as well that you&#8217;re here. Warriors rely on the mercy that priests have gained from the gods." He squinted at the halfling. "Of course, Bristlebane is the lord of thieves, is he not?"</P><P>"Bristlebane is the Overseer of the Oppressed, commander. Thieving is a necessity of life, as is a sense of humor." Wigglewood gave him his Happy Look.</P><P>Regren frowned. He addressed his subordinate. "Nyaleen, has your associate witnessed the brutality of the Crushbone clan?"</P><P>"No, sire."</P><P>Regren glowered and turned to the halfling. "You must understand the threat they hold to us, if you&#8217;re going to be a civilian of Norrath. Each person is responsible for survival of the next. Gone are the days of living alone, independent of one another. Even Nyaleen has learned that no one person can survive." He looked at her expectantly and she nodded a reply, her face rigid.</P><P>"Then when you're finished with your business here," the commander continued, "my charge will guide you into Crushbone where you will learn what our enemies are about." He smiled balefully at Nyaleen before resettling his eyes on the Wigglewood. "I know you're not trained as an Emerald Warrior, my friend, but I still take it upon myself to educate you about the local dangers. Use your skills wisely."</P><P>The halfling rocked back and forth on his prodigious toes. "I was about to go on a long trip, but you're right. I should have more experience." He winked over his shoulder at Nyaleen. She wore the fierce face again.</P><P>"Yes sir," she said, saluting her commander, her face tactfully shifting from fierce to dutiful. "I&#8217;ll give him the Crushbone tour immediately." Though she might be Wigglewood's friend and, by common history, a cousin, she was above all a soldier. "I worried for his safety, commander, that's why I haven't shown him the castle earlier."</P><P>Regren was already studying a new scroll. He grunted and nodded, obviously trying to return to the other matters. "Good luck with your training, Nyaleen," he said, dismissing them.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER">***</P><P>Faces of soldiers drifted in and out of the mist on the path leading north out Kelethin. Dour men and women returning home silently passed Wigglewood by; others sat in make-shift camps on hillsides and under trees, watching nothing or eating or wiping their weapons clean. The halfling couldn't take time to stare, pressed as he was to keep up with Nyaleen's quick pace further into the Faydark woods. He wasn't doing so well, hampered by chainmail armor that laid over him like a net. She'd given it to him when he arrived in the elven city, but he never wore it. It was heavy. The tunic was bad enough, the leggings pieces and the coif were plain cruel. He slogged over the mossy ground, trying to keep sight of the warrior one hilltop ahead. She moved surpisingly fast in all that metal. </P><P>A howl of pursuit severed Wigglewood's progress as Nyaleen once again disappeared over a crest. A tattered soldier broke from the trees onto the path in front of him. The halfling veered to give the man room to run, but a second figure, then a third and a fourth pierced the veil of mist, each futilely striking out at their elusive quarry. Scrambling to gain ground, they pushed Wigglewood aside. All the halfing saw was black blue fur, vicious teeth, and monstrous arms, hunched as they trampled him, intent on the soldier ahead. Their wake was filled with the smell of a seasoned bathhouse. </P><P>Wigglewood gagged, falling to his knees. Explosions of white and red light erupted over the horizon behind him, drowned out by the clang of blades and an exchange of curses. Then the sound of running carried the conflict away. </P><P>The halfling stared down the path, listening. His breath caught, overwhelmed by fear that the beasts would quickly return, this time to end the halfling's meddling in their lands. He forced himself quietly to his feet, checking the ground for dropped items.</P><P>A glint of color startled him. He bolted a step to the left and lifted the mace he'd forgotten about in his hand, striking out haphazardly at the movement.</P><P>"Watch that," Nyaleen said, dodging the blow. She stood, unwinded, in the middle of the path, examining the surrounding land intently. She held twin blades at the ready, sharp glimmering extensions of her arms. "Did I lose you?"</P><P>"No, there was a chase involving one soldier and three beasts close behind." Wigglewood held his breath at the memory. "Oy, they smelled. And all four of them mistook me for the path. The soldier nearly ran me over." Wigglewood rubbed his head and looked for a place to put his mace, but didn't find one. "I guess I wouldn't have given me much thought, either, with enemies like those on my heels." Nyaleen was watching him silently. "So those are orcs, all smell and no manners?"</P><P>"Small ones, yep." She turned back in the direction of the rising hills and Crushbone Castle on the other side. "Are you ready? The mist is opening up a bit, we should be able to stay clear of anyone else on the hunt."</P><P>"Hunting? So far everything out here feels like a footrace." He shouldered his pack and started north on the trail behind the warrior, who jogged slightly faster than a quick walk.</P><P>"Yank and spank," she said without turning. "Cull one from the group and ambush it in safer territory. The fellow that ran you over yanked too hard, had to make the run back to the city guards. That's the thing about orcs, once they're in a fight, they love a good chase. They'd run right into a bed full of hornets if you went in first. That's why the yank and spank works so well. And why it goes wrong so quickly. A smart warrior knows where his friends are. Remember that. I've probably lead just as many to their doom as I've killed myself. Still do, when necessary."</P><P>Wigglewood adjusted his backpack, pulling his feet from the moss to keep up with her. "Uh, yeah," he said. "You know, maybe I'm changing my mind about this whole adventure. I'll could explain to Regren that I suffer from back pains, and then make him a deal on some leather whips I haven't been able to move."</P><P>"I don't want him mad at me. Do you want him mad at me, when I'm this close to completing my training?" She displayed two gauntletted fingers held a smidgen apart. "And I thought I said to give those whips away if they didn't sell."</P><P>Wigglewood sighed, exasperated and wet with collecting humidity. The constant woodland mist rolled dramatically over them, a beast of a different flavor. "I'm supposed to give stuff away, Ny? You said I was here to make a profit, not a social conscious. That's your job." </P><P>Forced to watch his feet instead of the path ahead, the halfling bumped into the back of her legs with the top of his head. She stood immobile in the path. "What?" he said. "Are you angry at me again?" </P><P>The warrior pointed into the mist with one of her blades. "See how the path goes up, and ends in where those fires are burning?"</P><P>Wigglewood peered around her armor. He couldn't see more than ten paces ahead. "Yeah, kinda," he lied.</P><P>"That's the entrance to Crushbone, heavily guarded by a gang of orc centurions."</P><P>Wigglewood dropped his mace with a thud. "A gang?" </P><P>"Aye," she nodded, and indicated with her sword for him to crouch as she did. "Listen."</P><P>Under the breath of the forest, he heard the crackling of fire. "Fire, right, I hear that," he whispered hoarsely. When she didn't reply, her tall ears practically bending forward to catch the nuances of tree sounds, the halfling scanned what he could see, anxious. To the left and slightly forward, a simple stone monument rose up indefinitely into the fog like an unmarked headstone in a giant cemetery. He turned his head away, disturbed by the image, only to further surprise. An empty tent stared back at him with its open flap. It was nuzzled up next to another monument identical to the one on his left. The bleeding corpse of an elven soldier lay next to a black heap of decaying orc flesh.</P><P>Wigglewood tapped on Nyaleen's armor. "Ny, I --"</P><P>"Shhhh," she interrupted. "Here they come."</P><P>His skin prickled in alarm. They, a gang of orcs? He swiped up his fallen mace and raised it like a shield, even though the warrior remained in a crouch. "What are you waiting for?" he demanded. Then abruptly, a whooping war cry broke from behind him, and rush of soldiers -- elven and other -- flew past the pair and charged up the path until they were only shadows. They were answered by beasts.</P><P>"Let's go, stay close." Nyaleen jogged forward as quick as possible without losing Wigglewood, which meant half running, half lumbering sideways so she could keep an eye on him. The path ended in an open stretch that fed into the maw of a wide tunnel in a rising mountainside. The soldiers who'd dashed past them had drawn the four orc sentries away from the entrance and engaged them near a massive bonfire to the left, surrounding them with a flurry of blades and maces.</P><P>Wigglewood almost overran Nyaleen as they dodged around the battle and sprinted into the tunnel. He wasn't convinced that other centurions weren't hiding in anticipation of such a maneuver. Once inside, Nyaleen hugged the stone wall, as she led him around a sharp corner. The tunnel continued straight for only a short distance before turning again toward Crushbone. A ring of soldiers sat against the walls in the pocket of space in-between turns, as if holding the tunnel interior as a refuge against the orc camps. </P><P>Now, holes in the ground were among Wigglewood's favorite things. A snug burrow, a mug of warm plum wine and a riddle upon which to chew. A warren he'd call home. Toss in a mulberry pie, and he'd never leave. But as the daydream wrapped cozily around him, the mountain pass made him shiver, wiping away the rumination with a brush of stagnant air. </P><P>"Ugh. Smells worse than orcs in here."</P><P>"That would be the dead ones. We leave their bodies as a warning. The pass is ours," she said. Wigglewood looked around uneasily, more than a little revolted over the conduct of war. "At first I felt sorry for them," she said, watching his reaction, "but I came to understand that Emperor Crush desires nothing more than our utter destruction, and it's only by careful and methodical weeding of their ranks do we keep them from returning to power. Leave them alone for a day, or even a night, and they swell to impossible numbers." </P><P>"That's not reassuring," he said, even more anxious. He looked over the room's contingent. Half were bandaged and staring into nothing while others raptly studied tattered books and half-torn scrolls. Another few stood guard over the rest, swords drawn against imminent attacks.</P><P>Nyaleen put her hand on his shoulder. "We're here all the time, my friend. There's little to worry about. Ready to go on?" </P><P>"No," he said, watching her proceed further into the tunnel. He hefted his backpack and followed. He trudged through the dimness until, around the next turn, he could see the clear sky of Crushbone shining at the end of the pass. Morning had broken. Nyaleen stood in the open area beyond the pass, inspecting the grounds he couldn't quite yet see. When the warrior waved for him to join her, he hefted his mace confidently and started forward at once. Not only was there no clinging mist to weigh on him, but he could see clearly for the first time since arriving in Kelethin. His heart lifted. He even remembered the mulberry pie he was planning to eat for lunch. He could almost taste it.</P><P>Wigglewood stopped before he reached the end of the pass. An alcove that was at one time shaped by a frame of round stones was now filled in with a gray mortar. The result was rough and flaky to the touch, but in the shadow of the pass, the mortar was barely discernable from the rest of the wall. </P><P>Nyaleen hollered at him, "What are you doing?"</P><P>"On my way," he shouted back, but when he turned to wave at her, the mortar burst out from the wall, dropping at his feet. A furry blue hand shot out from the concealed space and grabbed him around the throat.</P><P>&quot;Halflings like you are better left dead than alive,&quot; an orc cursed from inside the hidden recess. It pulled him into the remaining mortar, cutting his forehead on the sharp, dry edge, then ramming his left temple into an actual stone in the wall. The orc let Wigglewood fall to the ground so it could smash away the rest of the mortar. The halfling crawled backward during the few seconds he had, feeling for the mace he had dropped once again.</P><P>&quot;Death to all those who oppose the Crushbone orcs!&quot; the orc cried out, swinging a rusty blade down at him. Wigglewood rolled out of its way and smashed at the hairy knees with the mace. Surprisingly, he hit, but it only enraged the beast. Howling, the orc slashed the mace, almost knocking it from the halfling's hands, then struck again, this time crushing his shoulder with the blunt blade. The ringmail armor prevented it from reaching skin, but that didn't lessen the pain. Wigglewood's upper right arm bristled numb.</P><P>"Help!" he yelled, finding his feet and backing away as the orc pressed its assault. "Nyaleen, help!" Under the onslaught, he couldn't get the mace balanced to attack. He held it like a metal staff, fending off his opponent's continuous blows. The beast knew it had the physical advantage, and Wigglewood imagined that it was daydreaming of halfling stew. Though its only armor was a rag of a shirt and shiny silver belt buckle, the orc was taller, stronger, and had teeth like a mean dog that it liked to gnash and lick with a nasty black tongue. He knew the battle would be lost if the beast breathed directly on his face.</P><P>"Sorry, Wig," Nyaleen said from nearby. She was behind him in the tunnel, evaluating the fight. "The more I think about it, then more I know Regren is right. You've got to learn to fend for yourself. When you go to the Common Lands, I won't be there."</P><P>"What, are you crazy?" He dodged a strike to his head and managed to swing his mace at the orc in return. The orc sidestepped the blow and redoubled its efforts, slashing the halfling's cheek and then crushing his wrist when he tried to protect his face. "I'm going to die here!"</P><P>Nyaleen's answer was soft but adamant. "This might sound cruel, cousin, but you're going to have to kill him yourself. This is the way we learn."</P><P>Bewildered, Wigglewood fled the tunnel for open ground. The orc followed, clubbing him ruthlessly across the back. Only the sight of other soldiers nearby kept him from falling to his knees, for surely one of them would come to his rescue. Get lifted the mace and swung wildly behind him, forcing the orc to take a step back. He saw Nyaleen closely following the beast, but still not coming to his aid.</P><P>"Fight him with your strength," she said, "not with your weakness."</P><P>It was if her advice formed into a hook that breached his heart and drew the heat of wrath across the surface of his skin. He pummeled the orc back with a blow to its neck, pushing it back a step, "Why don't you just tell me what the hells you mean," he said, spitting the words out. &quot;I can't figure it out right now!" </P><P>"Wig, do you know how to use that mace?"</P><P>"No, gods, no! Help me!" </P><P>The orc's next slash didn't reach him. As the centurion lifted the rusty blade to strike down on Wigglewood's head, Nyaleen swatted its sword arm with one blade and cut across its unprotected back with the other. The orc turned to protect itself, leaving the halfling free to gasp for air and unceremoniously collapse to one knee. "Prayer," Nyaleen said. "Pray for the power of your Lord Bristlebane. Don't you remember your own training?" She seemed undisturbed by the orc's swordplay, easily parrying blows while holding a conversation. </P><P>"I can't pray for help with a beast at my throat," he choked. </P><P>"Exactly." She batted the orc's head between her blades, striking quickly with one then the other, but only surface wounds. She wasn't going for the kill. This drove the orc insane, a clever ploy to distract the beast from the fact that it now faced a much greater foe. </P><P>A greater foe, indeed, Wigglewood told himself. Nyaleen attacked with swift calculation, completely unrestricted by her armor's weight or binding fit. Her armor moved with her, not against, enhancing her already formidable skills. The halfling kicked himself for chiding her about accepting the armor. It was like a partner, complementing instead of simply defending. Watching her, his anger turned away from her and into himself. She's been training constantly to hone her skills, while he'd merely run from his.</P><P>She does deserve her surname, he thought. She's a killer fighting for her homeland, and what am I but a prayerful man? A painful man, that's what I am.</P><P>He struggled to his feet, his head throbbing and favoring his left side. A rib felt broken. Worse, a rage built up inside him. The orc's beating reshaped the mercy of Bristlebane into scorn. Nyaleen held the beast between her blades, watching her associates' response.</P><P>"Make the summons," she told him over the orc's howls and shrieks. "Bristlebane is everything for you."</P><P>Imagining himself in a dark room, a single candle lighting his face, he called on his master. <I>O Bristlebane, this orc is not built to last.</I> Immediately, clarity returned to his senses, pushing out the misery and replacing it with relief. His arms took on a life of their own, completing a complicated swirl of forearm and fingers. His fingertips tingled, and a red flash of light crashed around the orc. It crumpled to the ground, accompanied by a rumble of thunder.</P><P>Wigglewood sat heavily. As if on signal, rain started to fall. He looked up into it, letting the cool drops drain away the heat away from his face.</P><P>"Karana blesses you," Nyaleen said. She stood over the centurion&#8217;s body and used her blades to cut away the beast's belt. With a flick of her wrist, she tossed the leather and silver prize into his hands.</P><P>"Loot," he said, feeling at the silver with a thumb. "Bristlebane blesses me, too."</P><P>The warrior guffawed. "There is a man in Kaladim who will reward you well for that buckle."</P><P>Wigglewood touched his side and his forehead. He knew he should feel worse than he did, but there was more to Bristlebane's mercy than a shock to the orc. He felt refreshed. His head no longer throbbed, and the sting had been cleansed from the cut on his cheek. "I don't know," he said. "I might keep this one for myself."</P><P>Nyaleen smiled serenely at him, youthfulness replacing the toughed warrior for an instant. "Ready to get out of here?"</P><P>"I am, yes. Please." He took her proffered hand and let himself be pulled to his feet.</P><P>She slapped him on the shoulder and helped him adjust his backpack. "Nice smite, by the way." </P><P>"I wouldn't call it a smite," he said. "More like a holy pie in the face."</P><P>She laughed, "Mulberry pie, maybe?"</P><P>Wigglewood licked his lips. "Definitely mulberry!" He swung the centurion&#8217;s belt in a circle around his free hand. "Say, Kaladim's on the way to the docks to Freeport, isn't it?"</P><P>She laughed again, walking next to him through the pass, tapping one blade on the stones in the wall, careful against a second ambush. Soldiers ran obliviously around them on their way in and out of Crushbone. One emergency over, another about to begin. </P><B><I><P>End of part 1</P>

Has Verant given up on the PvP servers?<br><br>It seems that it has, as bugs and exploits known for MONTHS have neither <br>been fixed or dealt with in any manner.<br><br>The following short-list of bugs and or exploits off the top of my head that <br>have been ignored by Verant.<br><br>Mez bug.  If an enchanter assumes the race of the person they are attacking <br>and mez's that person it causes that person to remain mez'd even when they <br>are hit until the mez's duration wears off.<br><br>Illusion bug.  Many spells will not work on someone in the same form as the <br>person that is attacking or they have attacked.<br><br>Illusion bug #2. You cannot loot the person even if you kill them if they <br>are in the illusion form of the same race as the person that killed them.<br><br>The Illusion bugs also occur when the person is using the item Mask of the <br>deceiver.<br><br>Rogue pet syndrome.  If you send pet to attack another player, and use egg <br>shaped pumice against them at the same time, the pet goes rogue and becomes <br>an NPC. The pet then hits for full damage, and causes exp loss if it kills <br>the player or the mage himself. People without honor can cause the pet to go <br>rogue on purpose in an attempt to cause exp loss to the other player.<br><br>Permanent invisible Pet.  A not so well known exploit, I would offer <br>information to the designers if they would like it but would rather not post <br>it to keep it from being abused even more. Its affect is to cause a pet to <br>become invis. Permanently. When it attacks mobs or players. While I have <br>never used this against someone, this is a VERY exploitable bug in PvP.<br><br>Now, I'm sure there are more bugs/exploits than this.  And some of these <br>*MIGHT* have been fixed, but I have heard nothing to suggest they have. <br>Please Verant, fix these long standing problems on the PvP servers.

<P>
Well, now I feel the perfect fool.  There I was thinking nobody who read my last article felt it hard-hitting or controversial enough to comment on it.  It was a supreme downer to find my mailbox empty week after week, but I figured that lent me time to work on my fictional story (which is coming along nicely, by the way).  Then, to my shock and horror, I discovered that the web mail service I use had, once again and without telling anyone, changed the interface so that it no longer automatically downloaded mail from external accounts.  Well, isn't that just precious?<P>The next thing I know, I'm looking at page after page of e-mail from people who obviously care about me a great deal.  They took the time to let me know how I too can make an extra ten thousand dollars a month just from working out of my home!<P>Then came the reader response mail - droves of them.  It took me a solid three-and-a-half-hours of reading to get through them all.  I was so overjoyed, I couldn't help but grab one of my co-workers and throttle him until his tongue hung out and his eyes rattled in his skull.  (Simmer down, Dave - I know you have good medical coverage.)<P>After my mistaken assumption, I can't put to words how grateful I am to you all for writing in.  I received mail of support saying "right on," and "I couldn't have said it better myself," by the truckloads.  Every single one brought a smile to my face, and my thanks goes out to each of you, bar none.  Other letters I received told stories of times they had been killed by a player-killer who actually <I>did</I> roleplay the scene out.  All I can say is that your stories were entertaining, inspiring, and I envy each and every one of you with a seething, unending jealousy!  I even received a tempting offer by a concerned player named "Yibno" to kill me in a fully roleplayed scene.  It's a shame I stopped playing on Rallos Zek...<P>As per my usual habits, I'm here now to post and respond to a number of thought-provoking letters.  As with the many kudos I received, the intelligent, well-thought-out e-mails were bountiful to the nines.  I sincerely wish I could post each of them here, or even drop a personal note to all the people who took the time to write in their thoughts and contentions.  Sadly, due to sheer volume, I'm only able to post a handful of them here.  And though it pains me, it's a personal policy for me not to reply via e-mail, as that would make me start thinking about all those other e-mails that were deserving of a response.  Soon, I'm writing nothing but e-mails and not editorials, and that's not the pic-a-nic basket I'm looking to swallow, Boo-Boo.<P>I'll start with the one and only mindless letter I received.  I promised in the article that anyone who started flaming me as anti-PK was going to be made to look all the more hose-brained in the reader responses.  As I am a man of my word, here is the following mail...<P>----------<P><FONT COLOR="0000AA">So I am a stupid player-killer huh...  I pk all the time for fun.<BR>Reguardless if I know the player or not. <BR>The reason:  It is fun. <BR><P></FONT>I'm gratified beyond words.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>In a savage environment like the mid-evil times there were knights of valor <BR>which killed rogue assasins all the time.  Just as there are some Everquest <BR>paladins who feel it is there job as well.  During mid evil times some <BR>Rogues would kill only for money.  Some even rape and pillaged. Now EQ is <BR>set in a mid evil like time.  There wasn't always honor back then.  And if <BR>you are a cleric dressed in your richly churchly clothes and I see you are <BR>hurt.  Yes I would lift my blade to kill you. <BR><P></FONT>Actually, in <I>medieval</I> times, people like that were publicly executed in a rousing, typically gruesome event as an example of what happened to such criminals.  You get away with that role in EverQuest because somehow the local governments don't object to their citizenry being butchered outside their guarded borders.  And it may come as a surprise to you that death in the real world is <I>permanent</I> - even in medieval times.  You're comparing apples to oranges in your justification, bud... never a good idea.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>If I kill all the time because I play my character as a rogue with a metal <BR>problem then DEAL with it. <BR>If you can't and you call my situation inwhich I killed you cheap THEN YES <BR>THERE IS ONLY ONE GOOD ANSWER I CAN GIVE YOU. <BR><P>GO TO THE BLUE SERVERS. <P></FONT>At this point, I laughed out loud.  And here I thought I'd seen the last of the old tired "raving lunatic who runs around killing everyone" rationale for player killing.<P>If your character is stark-raving mad, so be it.  All I ask is that you put some effort into it and actually (gasp) <I>do something</I> that lets people know that's what you are.  If you haven't tried it, I recommend doing so - you might like it.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>Reason why:  You can not change ppl.  They will have to want to change.  All <BR>your letter did was fire up others and I think you are enjoying the <BR>attention and I rarely give that so feel lucky. <BR><P></FONT>Exsqueeze me?  When did I say I wanted to change people's play habits?  If I had to summarize the editorial it would be to say that player-killers should expect certain social consequences to their actions.  How is that changing what they do?<P>I take that back.  There is one thing I would change about people, and that would be for them to actually read an article or message board posting before voicing an ill-informed opinion.  <FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>-Sincerely (Davidn) <---- This is the lowest pk character that is insane. <BR>But my highest characters (43, 50, and 50) which will remain anon feel some <BR>of your pain and advise you that as Verant said nothing and no material <BR>should mean that much in the game that you are afraid to loose it.<BR></FONT><P>----------<P>Congratulations, Sincerely (Davidn).  You just won the cranial enema of honor.  Next time I suggest you think "topical" before you put another thought to the written word.<P>I'll say it again: I - am - not - anti - PK.  To anyone not in favor of open player-versus-player combat, I strongly recommend bugging out of Rallos Zek.  The fact is, I'm not.  I never said I was.  End of discussion.  If that's not good enough for you, sir, then it is you who must "deal with it."<P>The next letter is from another player-killer who tends to express his views in a more clear and concise manner...<P>----------<P><FONT COLOR="0000AA">Yes yes, most of your points are correct, im glad we somewhat understand<BR>each other. I knew about every consequence and reprecusion of my actions<BR>before i started pking, and accepted them.<BR><P>I assume one of these was directed at me "Filthey McNastey"...<BR><P>"I have reformed, i dont pk anymore, blah blah blah i ask your<BR>forgiveness"<P></FONT>The incident I cited in the article was so long ago, I don't recall the name of the character.  I doubt it was you that I saw, but it's not mathematically impossible on a purely cosmic scale.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>I NEVER asked anyone's forgiveness, i DID, however, get murdered<BR>repeatedly, and over the course of 2 months taking each one with no<BR>retaliation. After which i asked the ppl if they were satisfied, and<BR>when they told me yes, i said "then please, get over it".<BR><P>Now, this is not an unreasonable request, as most of the people that<BR>killed me i NEVER touched before. And they refused to leave me alone<BR>citing all this crap about how i sadistically castrated one of their<BR>guildmates or something...<BR><P></FONT>The request <I>is</I> unreasonable.  If I were one of your absent victims, I wouldn't care how many others killed you, or how many times they killed you, or how they weren't even victims if yours.  I wouldn't care that you profess not to PK anymore.  All I would care about is remuneration one way or another, be it that I kill you and retrieve my item and money or you give it back to me voluntarily.  Either way is fine by me, but certainly not the alleged acceptance of a handful of people I don't know whom you somehow see as speaking for me.<P>I agree, what happened to you was unfair - as much or more so than your actions might have merited.  But it doesn't settle matters, nor does it make them equal.  Not by a long shot.  I'm still out my property, and I will still be sorely angry over it, and I will despise you until the end of my days... erm, or I <I>would</I> if I were a victim, that is.<P>That is the reality of player killing, and that is the consequence.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>[...]Anyway, just so we understand each other, i feel that you are one of the<BR>smarter people on rallos, but i dont agree with one aspect of your<BR>attitude towards pks. The part about how all people should deplore that<BR>behavior and how it is an affront to all the senses of everyone. And the<BR>part about how they tend to whine when they get ganged up on.<BR><P></FONT>I never said people should deplore that behavior.  I said that player-killers should expect it when they do.  I said it is an affront to most people's sense of honor and justice.  I don't see how you can equate "most" with "everyone."  Try again.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>Seriously, nobody EVER whines about be ganged up on UNLESS they have hadNO time to prepare. YOU CANNOT say that uve heard whining about gang upswhen someone has been attacked for the first time. Its only AFTER theyare killed and you attack them at/near their corpse.<P></FONT>Do <I>not</I> presume to declare that I cannot say such a thing.  I do say it and I will continue to say it so long as it is the truth.  If you have encountered contrary behavior, fine, but I will not tolerate being labeled a liar, sir, by you or anyone else.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>Just thought id share my views with you...<BR>No, i am not beaten by my parents<BR>No, i am not molested<BR>No, no tragic childhood of any kind<BR>No, i dont eat Belgian children<BR>Yes, i do it to have fun<BR>Yes, i do it for personal gain<BR>Yes, I have a good amount of friends, some of which DO play comp games,<BR>some of which don't<BR>I lift weights, i play Bball<BR>Thats me...<BR><P></FONT>I'm glad to hear it.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>Sadly, this is not the vision i have of most EQ players, the ones that<BR>dont let things go, the ones that think pking is so deplorable. My<BR>vision of those ppl are ones that are somehow and in either a big or<BR>small way ostricized by society. Which psychologically explains why they<BR>do so much to "fit in" in EQ. I may be way off base here, i can admit<BR>that. But thats just what my psychology classes taught me, and the<BR>thoughts travel with each other logically.<BR><P></FONT>All I can say is, don't take everything you're told in psychology class as gospel.  It's not an exact science by any definition of the term, and I can guarantee that making general assumptions based on its principles will burn you.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>Lastly, id like to know who you are on the server. Pardon me if umentioned it somewhere and i just didnt catch it.<P>Matt Sabo</FONT><P>----------<P>Sorry, Matt - no can do.  The last time I gave out one of my character names, I never heard the end of it.  Besides, I'm on a sabbatical of sorts from Rallos Zek.  We'll have to see if I ever return.<P>Next up is a segment from a letter sent to me by a pleasantly articulate reader.  For the sake of brevity, I'll quote the portion of the letter I'll be addressing...<P>----------<P><FONT COLOR="0000AA">[...]  What bothers me the most is,  <BR>is that there is no Pker  that has respect for the fellow player.  Believe me,<BR>in the right role-playing circumstances,  Dueling/Player Killing can be fun!<BR> A good fight is what I'm looking for!  That's what I thought Rallos Zek was<BR>supposed to be about!  Aye, I have yet to find anyone like that on Rallos and<BR>I don't want to imagine what it must be like on the PvP team servers.    I<BR>have thought a lot about the issue of Coin-loot only?  Will this make a<BR>difference?  Will my pride be any less hurt?   My pride probably won't, but<BR>my anger might be subsided a bit.  Most of the anger/resentment I feel<BR>towards a pker is that the only reason they killed me was for my item that I<BR>had worked to get or a precious gift from a friend.  [...]<P>Sincerely,<BR>BuffyAng Whitemajestic</FONT><P>----------<P>What you say about there being no player-killers who respect their fellow player isn't entirely true, though I agree that at times it can certainly seem like it.<P>It's the coin-only issue you bring up that caught my attention.  One thing you must keep in mind when considering the prospect of coin-only looting is that, by default, it comes with a price.  Part of the reason player combat is such an adrenaline rush is the fact that you're putting so much more on the line than life and limb and the time it takes to recover your corpse.  In the face of defeat, you stand to lose the very Shining Breastplate of Misshapen Denting that you so depend on to gain an advantage in the fight.  Without that risk, how much of the excitement is lost?  Will it be as much of a "good fight," as you're looking for?<P>The truth is, nobody's qualified to make that determination for anybody but themselves.  Personally, I don't think I would care to play on Rallos Zek if it's ever switched over, but I can see how it would be the proverbial Holy Grail for others.  You, on the other hand, may feel differently.<P>I'll tell you what.  Head on over to Tallon Zek and try it out.  See what you think.  If you like it, then great!  I say go with it!  If not, at least you gave it a shot.  <P>Moving on, here's someone who lives by their definition of roleplaying in the same way most people live (and die) by the sword...<P>----------<P><FONT COLOR="0000AA">The roleplay non roleplay topic is played to death...<P></FONT>I agree, and it will continue to be played to death until a happy medium is found.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>What happens if your intent is to kill someone, and you stop to type out "Have at thee foul elf for the power of innoruk" well to put it mildy from another game "Kal Ort Por" If I am an ogre, or a DE, or a Troll, and I kill you I may or may not be roleplaying, to roleplay does not mean that I HAVE to talk to you. Seriously being a DE under the guidelines layed out, they are killed by nearly everyone...Do you expect that all DE's will be so kind enough as to tell you just exactly why he is about to kill you,or attempt to? <P></FONT>Oh, I dunno.  It always seemed to work for James Bond movies...<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>No he is not, and I would not consider having a social button to spam as you attack "ALL BUT DARK ELVES SHALL LIVE MY WRATH" asroleplaying, its just spam again. If you kill or if you do not kill isyour choice, but be warned, if someone is a DE out for phat lewt or not,if they kill you, don't complain its just a quake mentality, they areplaying a race which is expected to be killed and expected to be killed.A few choice word's during the attack is not needed or warrented due tothe fact that most people who are attacked will not fight, they will rununless they feel that they cannot possibly die.<P>Osiris TheMercs.org</FONT><P>----------<P>I have news for you, Osiris: They'll run anyway.<P>But your point is well taken.  Shouting insults at your opponent as you hack them to pieces isn't roleplaying in and of itself.  It may state your character as a devout member of his/her own race, but it isn't roleplaying.  Admittedly, it may fit your character's predefined persona to loom up, kill the victim, loot the corpse and vanish without a trace.  That's plenty fine as long as you realize that doing so is also the hallmark of a powergaming PK out for his next batch of "phat loot," and more often than not that is exactly how you will be perceived.  I can't change that, and quite honestly I don't see why it <I>should</I> be changed.<P>If that doesn't sit well with you, be imaginative in your approach.  Be creative in your actions, and more importantly in your <I>reactions</I>.  You'll have the distinction of playing your role better, I promise you that.  If nothing else, you can't be faulted for trying - it's failing to try that people should be faulted for, but never seem to be.<P>Here's someone who feels similarly with your sentiments...<P>----------<P><FONT COLOR="0000AA">do you play many roleplaying games besides eq? well if you fo thenroleplaying is  how you make a character...not how YOU think peopleshouold play them.    So what if someone wants their character to hate DE or Trolls, thatswhat roleplaying really is bud making your char how you see fit theyshould be played ... not by some gay idies of "i slay you in the name oftunare" when killing orcs thats bs,,,,, if you want to get into classspecific roleplaying then a shadow knight would kill anyone he sees andsame with trolls and ogres</FONT><P>----------<P>I do play other roleplaying games besides EverQuest.  Other multiplayer titles include Ultima Online, Asheron's Call, Baldur's Gate and Diablo as well as a dabbling in several MUDs and free-form chat rooms online.  I have played and game-mastered several pencil and paper roleplaying games, including Dungeon's and Dragons (Advanced and Basic), Gamma World, Star Frontiers, Mech Warrior, Star Wars and numerous other games my friends and I made up from scratch.  I have created characters with their own ambitions and drives that are not necessarily my own, both good and evil, male and female, mutant, alien and human alike.  Since the days of elementary school, I have led characters from humble beginnings to powerful and sometimes fearsome figures in the annals of countless worlds, at once playing the gallant hero who saves the day and the sinister villain who conquers with an iron fist.  I am now twenty-eight years old, and I still have not tired of exploring new worlds with my imaginary friends and their individual traits and faults in which I indulge myself.  Norrath is but one, single world among a thousand others I have visited through the eyes of my characters.<P>Don't preach to me what roleplaying is.  Judging by your letter, it's my bet I was roleplaying characters before you were on solid foods.<P>The following is an excerpt from a very long-winded, angry individual.  I love it when I touch a nerve... <P>----------<P><FONT COLOR="0000AA">[...]  "I don't care if it's in the game context or not, expect to be labeled a bad<BR>person"<P>You know, that's a VERY interesting statement, coming from someone who<BR>complains that PKs aren't roleplaying. If even killing other people within<BR>the context of the game is deplorable... then, what *isn't*?<BR><P></FONT>When did I say player-killers never roleplay?  That would be untrue.  I said I've never had a player-killer roleplay while they killed <I>me</I>.  That's factual.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>Do you actually expect me to ask people if I can attack them, first? <P></FONT>Not if you don't want to.  You're free to play like a koala bear, for all the interest I have.  Just be aware of the consequences, and don't be an ass when they come back to bite you in yours.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>Do you actually expect that I'm going to issue a duel-challenge to everyone <BR>I feel like killing? <P></FONT>*shrug*  If you like. In most cases it would be rather pointless to do so on the Rallos Zek server, but I won't complain if you do.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>Seriously... what the heck is a Neutral Evil Dark Elf  Supposed to do, in<BR>order to gain the "Shadoe Seal Of Approval: Acceptable PK" award????<P></FONT>Nothing.  There's no such thing.  But I am gratified that you place so much stock into my opinion about your play style.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>I think that, if you were to take the time to ask RZ players, you'd see that<BR>most of them have no objections to being attacked by someone of an obviously<BR>hostile race. Most people would tell you that the biggest issues on the<BR>server are the loot disparity between melee classes & casters, various<BR>camping exploits (zone, corpse, & bind-point), pet exploits, no ability to<BR>use Fear or Charm in PvP fights, twinking, & EBay farmers.<BR><P></FONT>Those are all valid concerns about EverQuest, but it doesn't negate the fact that I think your original assumption about Rallos Zek players is false.  <P>Even so, I never professed to speak for the majority of the playership.  In fact, as a roleplayer I'm vastly outnumbered when it comes to statistics.  This is my column, and these are my opinions and my thoughts, and I'll still say them even if 99% of my fellow players violently disagree.  To do otherwise would go against the point of having your own column.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>cordially,<BR>Aumvaar Flaye<BR>Ambassador of The Horde</FONT><P>----------<P>(I love how he had the audacity to use the word "cordially.")<P>Let's switch gears for a while, and explore the the kinder, gentler side of Rallos Zek...<P>----------<P><FONT COLOR="0000AA">Dang, your article about PK, its all true.  Preach on, you make me want<BR>to join a PK server.  I'd think that there would be a lot more value on<BR>items and money in pk servers than blue servers.  <P></FONT>There is, but more so for one's level than anything.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>You would probably get more role playing out of it, and less jerks.  <P></FONT>You don't, but what roleplaying I have managed to find was of exceedingly good quality.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>Almost nay quarrel may be resolved by PK'ing.

After switching to Luclin for a while, it took me the longest time not to panic whenever I heard the sound of someone casting a spell nearby.<P>Anyway, I tried playing on Rallos once just to prove to myself that it wasn't for me, and it ended up being my favorite server for a long, long time.  To anyone who hasn't tried it yet, I highly recommend giving it a day or two just to see what happens.  You may surprise yourself.  A few others may surprise you, too.<P>Here's another inquiring letter...<P>----------<P><FONT COLOR="0000AA">I read your article on PKing on Rallos Zek... This piqued my interest, as I <BR>apparently have had the wrong impression of things... I'm assuming you've <BR>played on a PvP server a lot, how often do you get attacked?  <P></FONT>That depends greatly on your play style.  If you're really into grouping, you'll get the occasional greedy soul who will prey on you when the chips are down, but usually not so often that it becomes annoying.  If you like going solo, be prepared for an attempt on your life at the very least daily (real time).  If you hang out in the more populated zones, adjust that figure accordingly.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>If I create a charecter there, will I constantly be dying(moreso than already), <BR>or is it just a side bit? i.e. Do I have to PK to get decent exp, or can I simply <BR>play on that server just as normal and PK only in certain situations[?]<P></FONT>As a newbie, expect to be attacked a <I>lot</I>.  It calms down to a dull roar after a while, but ultimately the danger never ends, even for level 50+.<P>And as far as player killing for experience goes, abandon that idea - you don't gain experience or skill increases for fighting other player characters.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>(despite what you said, I do RP on normal servers sometimes, and the major <BR>appeal to me about PvP servers is the freedom to kill a Teir'Dal when I'm <BR>playing a High Elf... but at the same time I will say "Remove your sorry Teir'Dal <BR>hide from my sight, or I'll remove it for you!")  <BR> <P>I haven't played on a PvP server, and I want to know if it's worth my time to <BR>start doing so... <P> -Erik Tollerud</FONT><P>----------<P>As I said above, it's well worth your time to try it out.  Nothing says you have to stay if it gets to be too tedious.  I wish you the best of luck, Erik!<P>Here is something of an informative letter based on another Rallos Zek player's point-of-view that you and others may find enlightening...<P>----------<P><FONT COLOR="0000AA">Hello Shadoe. <P>I just wanted to let you know that I truly enjoyed reading the article you <BR>wrote for the Vault Network titled The Reality of Player Killing.  I also <BR>play on Rallos Zek, and as you, I have played here for quite some time.  In <BR>fact, I have been a resident of Rallos Zek since the server was first created <BR>in Beta, and have been there ever since, in one life form or another. <P>At times, I have become disenchanted with the server, and I leave to try out <BR>one of the non-PvP server, only to find myself bored, frustrated, and <BR>returning to Rallos Zek.  I have found that the friendly Rallos Zek citizens <BR>are much more friendly then other servers, and I have also found that the <BR>PvP aspect keeps prices a bit more in check. <P>The hard part for me is I'm a warrior, and although I've been playing for <BR>quite some time, I'm still only level 22.  I'm not a power-gamer, and being <BR>a warrior - the smallest item stolen causes a lot of time and money to be <BR>wasted.... and believe me when I tell you have I have had many an item <BR>stolen.. <P>But..  I still remain loyal to Rallos Zek, in fact he is my chosen diety. <BR>The benefits do out weigh the negatives, and I know one day I will truly <BR>find a group of friends I can count on. <P>Anyway, I don't mean to bore you - I'm sure you are getting a lot of email <BR>that I should let you get back to.  Thank you for taking the time to listen, <BR>and perhaps I will see you in the world of Rallos Zek sometime.  Give me a <BR>/tell - I'm always open to making a new friend. <P>Sincerely, <P>- Myani, Fair-haired follower of Rallos Zek <P>:-)</FONT><P>----------<P>Thank you for writing in, Myani.  For a worshipper of Rallos Zek, you sure don't seem the aggressive type.  A pleasant surprise, for more reasons than one.  ; )<P>* Shadoe munches on his Salsa Verde Doritos, pondering the issue at hand.<P>Well... back to the player-killer submissions.  This one makes some excellent points I thought were interesting.  Here's a segment...<P>----------<P><FONT COLOR="0000AA">[...]  Some issues you didn't address that you might want to mention:<P>sold accounts:  should the reputation follow the account even though the<BR>new owner has no intention of being a PK?<P></FONT>As unfair as this sounds for the poor bastard who spent his money, I'd still stand my ground.  We have no guarantee that this account was actually sold to a whole new person, and frankly the thought that the player-killer who took my savant's cap actually made a real-life profit off of it sickens me... and it sickens my dog as well.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>zone camping/portal camping:  you only mentioned having a problem with<BR>being killed while linkdead or bugged, how about being torn apart by ice<BR>comets (or any relevant spell) the instant you appear while zoning?<BR><P></FONT>The ability of one player to defeat another player who is helpless to run away or retaliate due to an otherworldly cause will always be on my S-list.  I just used the linkdead/stuck circumstances as examples of what happened to me in the past.  (And yes, I did cry foul.  One of them was even nice enough to apologize and repay me.)<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>roleplaying attacks in hostile towns:  there are some zones that can be<BR>considered fair game for race based attacks, such as a group of lightskins<BR>killing guards inside Oggok.  By nature of where they are, they are<BR>inviting the defenders of Oggok (Ogres, Dark Elves) to attack them on<BR>sight.  Any opinions on this?<P></FONT>Oh sure, everything is contextual.  If there is a raid taking place, I certainly don't begrudge any of the invaders their right to kill me, and I can't imagine they would take issue with my right to kill them in defense of my homeland and my own life.  If a high elf comes roaming along through Nektulos Forest, you bet I wholeheartedly support a quick and decisive execution in true-blue Teir'Dal fashion.  Nektulos is supposed to be feared and considered dangerous by all light dwellers, in my own humble opinion.  Had I my way, such a thing would exemplify the spirit of PvP combat on Rallos Zek.<FONT COLOR="0000AA"><P>Hope to see more people like you in game.  I've been meeting some of them<BR>but they're hard to come by.<P>Yorloc<BR>50 Necromancer<BR>Member of Fearful Symmetry<BR></FONT><P>----------<P>Thanks, Yorloc.  All this talk is making me pine for my old characters... I may be returning to Rallos sometime soon.  Until then, be strong and don't let anyone tell you you're a hedonistic necrophile! <P>Here is a most disturbing letter I received...<P>----------<P><FONT COLOR="0000AA">I agree with just about everything except the roleplay section.  I'll consider <BR>myself and my friends 'normal' for the next statement.  Normal, non-pk, <BR>players pretty seem to only fight for 2 main reasons.  Fighting a pk or <BR>fighting someone your character isn't supposed to like.   Fighting a pk is <BR>obvious.   The second reason, fighting someone your character would attack<BR>in roleplay, you invalidate as a good reason to attack someone.  What's left <BR>for the 'normal' folks?<BR> <P>So I'm now curious, without pk's and if everyone followed the spirit of your <BR>post, when would you fight another player?  If you say only when dueling and <BR>both parties agree, then i will say "go to a blue server"  ;-)   <P>And while you're at it, tell me honestly, how much fun you've had chasing <BR>some idiot DB member all over Norrath.  I've done it alot.  Nothing my guild <BR>enjoys more than a 'hunt'.  Nice equipment means so much to RZ players <BR>because it CAN be taken.  Would accomplishments feel as good if there was <BR>less standing in your <BR>way? <P>KrayvexWild Hunt</FONT><P>----------<P>The reason this letter disturbs me is because it's obviously written by someone who is used to rational thought, but still didn't quite "get" the gist of my editorial.  That tells me the fault is mine for not putting across my point clearly enough.<P>So, I'll say it again.  There is every reason in the world for PvP combat.  I support it to the very bottom of my shoes to the top of my pointy head.  My objection is when player-killers think it makes sense to reap the advantages of being a senseless, marauding murderer without accepting the de facto social consequences.  If my article was about getting rid of player-killers, believe me it would be titled something very different, and probably something overtly vulgar.  But I don't think that way, so it won't be happening.<P>This next one is from a fellow writer colleague who decided to extend the courtesy of another player-killer viewpoint...<P>----------<P><FONT COLOR="0000AA">Hey Shadoe, I wrote an entire article on newbie pking awhile back. EQstratics <BR>put it up, but the Vault wouldn't. I think you'd like this, if you are going to <BR>write a corollary to your pking article feel free to lambast mine. I think you'll <BR>find I am both conscienceless and humorous in here. Its really quite strange, I <BR>am a National Merit Scholar, 1500 SAT etc., but all I do in EQ is kill newbies <BR>like 10 times in a row until they quite the game forever. Read this, print it up or <BR>portions of it in your column and flame me! It'll be fun! <P>Fearelemental, lvl 5 <BR>GF newbie PK, Rallos Zek<BR></FONT><P>---------<P>While his article is certainly at odds with my own opinions on more than one level, I thought it was well-written, and an excellent resource for anyone who wanted to get into the business of wanton destruction and bloodshed.  Sadly, he sent me the article itself and no address to link to it.<P>Fear... if you see this, please send me the URL where you posted your article, and I'll have our host Aurum place it right &gt;HERE&lt;.<P>Here's another good player-killer counterpoint...<P>----------<P><FONT COLOR="0000AA">I agree with most, if not all of these points made.<P>However, the one I have a slight problem with is the one on Roleplaying.  I<BR>play 2 characters on Tallon Zek, one a Rogue, the other a Warrior. As both, I<BR>have had the annoyance of having someone kill me when I have low HP or are in<BR>a fight with something else.<BR><P>However, how exactly are you supposed to Roleplay as a Rogue then? As my<BR>Warrior, I have had a Rogue come up to me and kill me while I was weak. I<BR>just took it to be roleplaying, and ignored it for the most part.<BR>As my Rogue, I've killed people who were low on life a few times before.<BR>However, I usually don't take anything besides money, as my consience won't<BR>allow it (some Rogue I am). Also, I only kill once, not<BR>stay-at-their-bind-point-and-kill-them-hundreds-of-times. Is this so bad? If<BR>so, then how should I do it? Asking them wouldn't work, not only would i get<BR>killed, it wouldn't make much sense (Can I please Rob you blind? Oh, yes,<BR>please do.)<P>If you have a better way, then by all means, I'm willing to listen, as it's<BR>annoying when you're level 2 & manage to fund a bow & arrows then lose the<BR>bow & arrows.<P>And yes, I realize that I have made quite a few enemies. I've even met a<BR>high-elven wizard who's friend I insulted so much that she killed herself<BR>twice so she would be in my level range. heh.

The subterfuge.  The mystery.  The bane of the unwary.<P>Again, it's all contextual.  However, it's still another pitfall for the way you choose to play.  I'm not making this up - people will hate you as a player-killer, and as their assassinator besides.  Not because I say so, but just <I>because</I>.  If you kill someone and they get all upset, it's certainly not because they read this article, I can assure you.  More likely, they don't have a clue who this obscure "Shadoe" guy is in the first place.<P> "Is this so bad?"  You tell me.  Ask the victim the same question and see what kind of response you get.  If they take it all in stride, then I see absolutely nothing wrong with it.  If they get upset and start shouting warnings about your actions and calling you all manner of uncouth names and you shrug it off, I still see nothing wrong with it.  If, however, you complain about their reaction and their opinion of you and carry on about how nobody in the zone will trade with you, then I very much see a problem - as it's your due as a devious assassin.<P>Anyway, think about it.<P>Well, if you've made it this far in the reader responses, count yourself among the elite.  I don't know that I would have!

The reason<br>for ths post is to bring up the issue of the what I feel, are WAY<br>over-buffed guards now running rampant in Norrath. I can understand the need<br>to buff Guards on the blue servers, where mostly powergamers and powerlvlers<br>seem to congregate. <br><br>However to implement such UBER-guards onto the PVP servers, seriously<br>hinders the PVP experience. Sacking a city was next to impossible in the<br>first place. Now it is simply not possible. I can understand the validity<br>the Verant does not want people to Camp Guards to get to lvl 60. However<br>this can be avoided by just taking away the experience from killing a guard.<br><br>One of the largest glory filled wants in PVP is to have a guild strong<br>enough that can possible raid a city, and take over for a day. Some might<br>complain that this is not fair. And that newbies would be hindered.<br><br>Chances are that newbies will be too low for the invading army to hurt,<br>and secondly.

<b><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?mes=5635761"><center>Discuss & Debate this article on the Boards</center></a></b><br><br>The Mirriam-Webster Dictionary defines 'rule' as:<br>1 a : a prescribed guide for conduct or action b : an accepted procedure, custom, or habit <br>c : (1) : a usually written order or direction made by a court regulating court practice or the action of parties (2) : a legal precept or doctrine d : a regulation or bylaw governing procedure or controlling conduct.  synonym see LAW<br><br>The "Play Nice Rule" has been in effect for a few months now. With the Kunark release, it has effectively distracted the EverQuest public from  it and its generated feedback by giving us a new shiny toy to play with. However, the "Play Nice Rule" has not gone away - and I personally believe that both players and Verant have issues to address.<br><br>First, let's address the player issues:<br><br>The general feedback that I've seen about this Rule has been pretty evenly split. About  the players hate it, and the others think it's a good idea. I will wholeheartedly agree that when it first came out, I was in the "hate" category. Now, amazingly, this really hasn't changed - I still don't like the Rule, per se. However, because I don't like the rule, doesn't mean I will disobey it. Verant has decided it's a policy they've chosen to implement, and I have to abide by that judgement as I'm "in their world now." I have shared spawns, and while not always gladly, my external reaction is a simple: Go ahead. And unfortunately, while there are some players that follow that same doctrine, there are two other types of players.<br><br>The first type of player takes the rule and changes it into something that I call the "Babysitting Rule."  This Rule is the rule that states that although this monster/mob or area is too hard for that player (or their group), they will come in anyway and attempt to share. However, said player (or group) will also expect you (or your group) to "babysit" them - to watch over them and make sure nothing bad happens to them. If something does go bad for them (or their group) you (or your group) will then be verbally assaulted for some minutes for "allowing" them to die. While I'm certainly not advocating NOT helping people when they're in trouble - I always ALWAYS put the needs of my own group before the needs of another. My own people need healing first, buffing first, protecting first. The "Babysitting Rule" is not the "Play Nice Rule" and shouldn't be treated as the same thing. <br><br>The second type of player looks at the "Play Nice Rule" and decides, for whatever reason, that this Rule does not apply to them. They are a high level player. They have been there longer. While monster/mob/area doesn't give experience, they need a certain item (more than you or your group does). They are greedy. There are any number of reasons why the "Play Nice Rule" doesn't apply to them. And sometimes, I can understand. If you've spent agonizing hours clearing an area and separating spawns it would be tough to easily capitulate. The problem is, I have never heard of anyone invoking the Rule in this sort of situation (although I'm sure it must happen occasionally, and I know this was a big worry when it was first implemented). The times I've seen people NOT share is usually on single spawn monsters (such as treants and spectres). Things that took no effort at all, but are "owned" by simply being present. And I've even read editorials that say that "that's ok." It isn't. In fact, that's exactly why Verant implemented the Rule in the first place - because people were not being courteous and sharing. <br><br>So, we're faced with 3 player archetype. Now to Verant's issues:<br><br>I am absolutely positive that Verant implemented this Rule with the best of intentions.  However, it was extremely short sighted of them to imagine that this Rule would 1) be received with no complaints and 2) be obeyed. And this Rule is yet another thing that calls attention to the overwhelming lack of in game customer support. I think very few players will disagree with the fact that there are simply not enough guides and GMs in the game - EVER. When GMs or Guides login, they must be absolutely overwhelmed with /petitions. For some servers, this may not be true - there might be guides and GMs aplenty. But on other servers this is not the case. How many players does EverQuest now support? Let's use a conservative number, just as an example, say, 32,000 people divided amongst the 32 servers, so 1000 people per server, at any given time. How many Guides are actually employed by Verant? I'd be curious to know. How many Guides? Considering that the most I've ever seen on my server (and no, this isn't taking into account that any number of them might be /anon) is 3, I'm guessing that not as many as are needed. On the message boards are constant complaints about the lack of customer service or poor customer service. When the last open call for Guides was made (before Kunark was released) how many applied? How many were accepted? Going back to the original point, this big (and it was big) change to their rules by the implementation of the "Play Nice" rule simply doesn't have the in game support from GM/Guides to make it something that people will constantly obey. After all - how often have you sped on the highway when you didn't see the police? And when they were driving right next to you? <br><br>And we're back to the beginning: What makes a rule? Simply saying "This rule exists" in this case doesn't seem to be enough. There needs to be people around who can enforce it. There shouldn't be negative connotations associated with it - since when did 'sharing' become a bad word?  While I may not think it was a good move by Verant to create it, now that the "Play Nice Rule" is here, it applies to everyone, whether we like it or not. <br><br><b><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?mes=5635761"><center>Discuss & Debate this article on the Boards</center></a></b>

<center><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?mes=5631897"><b>Respond and Discuss this article on the Boards</b></a></center><br><br>My question/rant involves the online Ruins of Kunark Store. Verant has been sand-bagging and quietly patting our cheeks and trying to down play the fact the ordering system is not online after two weeks. <br><br>There are some people (including myself) that actually waited to order RoK. I knew that no matter what Verant promised that with thousands of customers ordering frantically over the Net there would be problems. Heck, it was to be expected. I planned to wait a week or so after release to order my expansion, thereby avoiding the mad rush and insuring that I got a copy of the CD on time with no hang-ups from a billing standpoint. I thought the extra week wait would be a fair trade off for no troubles. For example, my best friend ordered the expansion via the store approximately two weeks ago, and just received his copy on Saturday the 6th. (With an apology from Verant enclosed, and that was it.) <br><br>The point I wanted everyone to think about is this: When there is an in-game problem concerning EQ itself, say if there was a dupe bug found, you can bet that Verant and the support staff will come in with both feet to fix it. They will do an emergency patch, slap up a hasty MOTD and go on with life. In fact if you think back, any issue that seriously impacted game play or might lead to players being able to exploit a bug (Pottery) or hamper other players gaming experience (ninja looting) it's dealt with very quickly. I won't even go into the much talked about "nerf attack" that Verant launches like lightning when anything remotely close to being "too good to be true" or "broken" ingame is noticed. <br><br>Taking that into account I find it odd that Verant has not yet fixed (or at least provided an alternative to) the online order system. I saw a post where Verant claimed, "We would rather have you buying the expansion from us anyway..." If that is the case why is nothing being done? I'm not a conspiracy theory adherent, but at some point if you examine the bigger picture it begins to look suspect. I (and others like me) are almost being punished for not purchasing the CD from a retail store. With all the new loot, new zones, and quests...not counting the experience of playing an Iksar character itself, it's hard not to feel cheated. The loot that is being gained from Iksar newbies is enough of an enticement to try one out for me, even if I had no interest from a role-play stand point. I see posts on message boards of the insane loot drops that are present in the newbie Iksar areas. What advantages are these players that happened to get RoK going to have over me loot or money-wise by the time I can get RoK? (I.E.-after Verant nerfs the loot back to comparable to other newbie zones after they feel that the Iksar race has "ramped up" to their foreign cousins?) <br><br>There is no reason that this problem cannot be handled with the same alacrity that other issues in EQ are solved with. If by chance there are legal issues or problems with Zomax contractually etc, at least post the relevant info to the loyal PAYING EverQuest consumers. Otherwise you (Verant) are doing nothing to enhance your reputation of lukewarm customer service and covert decision making regarding the playerbase. <br><br>I WILL NOT buy the expansion for 40$ retail, it's absurd. Verant should fix this ASAP. Even if I am depriving myself of gaming fun by boycotting, I am not going to give Verant 40$ above and beyond the 10$ monthly + 40$ initial cost to me for EQ because of a Verant SNAFU. <br><br>Stone Leaf -- Druid of Quellious<br><br><center><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?mes=5631897"><b>Respond and Discuss this article on the Boards</b></a></center>

<center><b><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?mes=5620110">Discuss and Debate This Article</a></b></center><br><br>Rare Spawns. <br><br>Those single two words have sparked issues of incredible size. Play-nice rules, E-Bay, and many other problems have cropped up simply because some spawns (Fishbone Earring, JBoots, Erudin Library Book) are far too rare for their own good. Why is this? No one here wants to wait 8 hours before a part of a needless quest pops. No one wants to deal with people who time their kills. So why are some spawns and items so rare? <br><br>Verant, would it really hurt the game SO MUCH if all the 50+ characters were able to collect a pair of JBoots, and a Fishbone Earring? Instead of these headaches (and for those of us that cannot play 36+ hours straight...), why not put these items in another quest, or put the item in another spawn and raise the difficulty? Why not have these wonderful items available on some merchant in a high level of, say, the Plane of Sky? The current quest for the JBoots is good (except for needing SOW to receive it from the guy in the FIRST place...), so just put one in for the other things. <br><br>Items like the Fishbone Earring are supposed to be really valuable, right? That's why you keep them with such a long spawn type, right? Well here's a thought- put 'em on a GOD or a DRAGON! I could easily see someone really high (50+) in Prexus' hierarchy having a Fishbone Earring. <br><br>Some items are just stupid, the way their spawns are. The page in the Erudin Book, for example. With the time this spawn takes, you might as well just have a separate quest to get the one page! Hell, that would be BETTER! <br><br>But still, the main point of my editorial is thus- why do the rare spawns have to be so rare? Is there no alternative?<br><br><center><b><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?mes=5620110">Discuss and Debate This Article</b></a></center>

After<br>setting aside my original annoyances and frustrations, however, I was fascinated<br>by the realization that the game HAS taken on a life of its own, and that<br>even the nasty turns are consistent with the evolution of a fantasy world<br>which the "creators" likely CANNOT truly control any more (although they<br><u>could</u> admittedly nerf or bureaucratize it to death).<br><p><u>Original E-mail sent to cfolz@verant.com on 4/16/2000, cc to eqmail@verant.com</u>:<br><p>Greetings:<br><p>The cfolz email address was reluctantly given to me by a Guide when<br>I stated that I wished to have an address to direct further communication<br>regarding the referenced attachment.

The producer letter description of the<br>need, however, was well articulated, because you only have to browse the<br>editorial and message pages of the various excellent EQ sites to see that<br>self-serving groups and even whole guilds HAVE virtually taken over unique<br>spawn sites to the detriment of non-member players. Individual abuses and<br>harassments have increased without question.<br><p>It was with some interest in your new policy, therefore, that I invoked<br>your "resolution" process on Friday night. Here was the situation:<br><p>-- For some months, I have been checking the Dyllin Starshine spawn<br>in HH, for the Book of Vanear page drop. This is a highly camped spot and<br>is rarely free, with a respawn of about 6-8 hours. At various times, I<br>had waited until boredom or other commitments had taken me elsewhere.<br><p>-- On Friday night, I found the spawn clear at about midnight, and proceeded<br>to wait, not knowing when Dyllin could next be expected.<br><p>-- Approximately one hour later, a halfling druid by the name of Haeen<br>appeared, and insisted that I should leave and that the spawn belonged<br>to him, because he had been there earlier and had "timed" the spawn. I<br>explained, assuming that he had been there earlier, that he had lost his<br>spot by leaving, and that I would not relinquish it back to him. He then<br>implied that his spell-casting would enable him to take the spawn away<br>from me, and he proceeded to try to "inspect" my equipment repeatedly without<br>permission.<br><p>-- Please note that this druid was green to me as a 26 Cleric, and I<br>believe I could have simply waited for the spawn and outblasted and outmeleed<br>him. But NO....he was an irritating and arrogant little smear whose behavior<br>was, I believed, directly and clearly contrary to the newly announced rules.<br>I therefore decided to invoke these rules rather than rely on MY superior<br>position, and rather than get into an odious pvp encounter. I petitioned<br>a GM.<br><p>-- After some time, but before the spawn appeared, GM Seign gated in.<br>I explained that Haeen was claiming the spawn because he had "timed" it,<br>and Seign initially conceded that returning to a "timed" spawn does not<br>give a player priority if someone else is already there. Seign then proceeded<br>to ask "who was here first?" Haeen claimed he was, but admitted that he<br>had left "to kill some blues and run errands." I advised Seign that I had<br>been there for about an hour with no other players present, which Haeen<br>disputed and said had been only "20 minutes." Haeen also admitted to Seign<br>that he had returned at this time because he had "timed" Dyllin to appear,<br>and that he was entitled to the spawn because other players had kill-stolen<br>the spawn from him before. Haeen also was very clear about how he hadn't<br>reported this supposed kill-stealing because didn't like or agree with<br>the "play nice" policy.<br><p>-- So, the indisputable facts were:<br><br>1) I had been at the site for at least 20 minutes(Haeen's admission),<br>and as long as an hour(my recollection), with no other player present;<br><br>2) Haeen might have been at the site earlier, but had left. There was<br>no way of verifying when he had been there or for how long.<br><br>3) Haeen's main claim to priority at the site was that he had "timed"<br>the next spawn.<br><p>-- You must understand my shock, therefore, when Seign the announced<br>that he could not determine who was there "first", and would settle the<br>dispute with having us do a dice roll.<br><p>-- I advised Seign that this was unacceptable and unprincipled, since<br>he had enough evidence to make a ruling, not cop out. When he insisted<br>that this was the only "fair" thing he could do, I told him that I would<br>not participate in the dice roll, and I left. I did not feel that this<br>spawn was so important that I should have to ratify Seign's peculiar solution<br>by participating in it. I have no idea what happened to the spawn, but<br>I assume that the strident little druid got his wish.<br><p>-- In further conversation with Seign, he insisted that the "only fair"<br>thing he could do was to use the dice roll. I eventually asked him to preserve<br>a full copy of the encounter, so that others could review it fresh. It<br>wasn't until after I logged off that I realized I could have saved it myself,<br>as a series of screen shots.<br><p>The problem, as I see it, is this:<br><p>-- You have a policy in which you wish to enhance player satisfaction<br>by encouraging fair play and discouraging intimidating, territorial and<br>possessive behavior. Among other things, exclusive campings and "reservations"<br>are not permissible.<br><br>-- To assist in this policy, you have set up your GMs and guides to<br>apply these rules of fair play and to sanction bad behavior, if warranted.<br><br>-- It is clear that a player may not assert "possession" of a spawn<br>site after he has abandoned it.<br><br>-- It is equally clear that "timing" a spawn does not entitle a player<br>to "possession" of a site after he has abandoned it - this is simply a<br>rational corollary of the rule.<br><br>-- It is clear that I was the only player on site when the other player<br>with his "timing" claim appeared.<br><br>-- Seign chose to ignore the fact that Haeen had abandoned the site,<br>and that I had been waiting alone for the spawn for some time.<br><br>-- IF EQ policy IS to decide ALL of these issues with a dice roll,<br>as suggested by Seign and his guides (who were, by the way, oddly reluctant<br>to give me a name or address to whom I could direct this further communication),<br>then EQ should make that announcement in a new producer letter so that<br>players are not misled into believing that they can expect fair rulings<br>instead of random results.<br><br>-- It seems to me, however, that EQ may actually intend and prefer<br>to provide just and fair resolutions when possible. In that light, please<br>examine what happens when dice rolls always settle disputes:<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "bad guys" don't CARE. They're in it to manipulate<br>the system. "Why can't we all just get along" and "you guys should go out<br>and settle it between yourselves" are the refrains they MOST like to hear.<br>When the judge then leaves, the bad guy smirks...he has won.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) the good guys don't KS or spawn steal. They generally<br>apologize and leave when they realize they have inadvertantly intruded<br>on someone else's kill. The bad guys therefore rarely have their sites<br>disputed when they get there first.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) When there exists enough evidence to make a ruling,<br>but the GM refuses to do so because of inexperience or discomfort with<br>the responsibility, the bad guy wins. Consider: the bad guy's legitimate<br>camps will not be disputed by the good guy...but when the good guy's legitimate<br>camps are disputed by the bad guy, he (or she) get a 50% statistical chance<br>of beating the good guy out of his spot with a dice roll. It doesn't take<br>a mathematics wizard to realize that dice rolls work VERY nicely to the<br>advantage of the bad guy. The bad guy wins again.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) the bad guys generally have no compunction about<br>lying. For this reason, GMs should inquire about testimony fron other players.<br>Nevertheless, many situations will boil down to unresolvable evidence (can't<br>tell who is lying) Those probably only can be resolved with a dice roll.<br>The bad guy wins again, but this is the ONLY scenario that can't be helped<br>at first. However...GM staff should be keeping a player complaint file<br>to see if one or the other of those players is consistently a party to<br>complaints. After a certain threshold, EQ should have a pretty good idea<br>that such a player is manipulating this built-in uncertainty.<br><p>So...what are you going to do? The larger issue is whether EQ intends<br>to do the right thing...or the easy, convenient thing. You have created<br>a wonderful game which is indeed developing into a "society," but there<br>are snakes in this paradise which must be dealt with. The Game is evolving<br>at an amazing rate, and may become something quite surprising and important<br>....if it survives. You people have quite an interesting responsiblity<br>AND opportunity here. Do not discount the importance of your treatment<br>of this issue (which might be defined as the Administration and Application<br>of Justice on EQ). You have only to read the multiple postings at the various<br>sites on the reasons for dissatisfaction, to understand the potential impact.<br>I would presume that your direct "feedback" file also has a plethora of<br>aggravated complaints on these issues.<br><p>On my more personal isuue...what are you going to do? I believe there<br>is really no reasonable question as to what the result should have been<br>-- unless EQ wishes to announce that "timing" spawns bumps waiting players<br>as a priority. I was so frustrated and frankly infuriated by your GM's<br>"solution", after I voluntarily elected to abide by and apply EQ's new<br>rules, that I almost terminated my membership on the spot. There is no<br>correction of the specific spawn problem now possible, since it involved<br>no-drop items, but I believe that I deserve an apology from both Verant<br>and Seign, that Haeen should be advised of what the correct ruling should<br>have been, and that Seign should be admonished to do his job correctly<br>and trained to make that possible.<br><p>Please understand that in addition to my complaint, this letter is intended<br>as a heartfelt plea for EQ to correct a continuing and serious problem<br>which likely will have very bad long-term repercussions for the viability<br>of a game that I dearly love... if not corrected.<br><p>As final constructive criticism, allow me to point out that this is<br>potentially an extremely complex game because of its online player interfaces,<br>and that future expansions, additions, tweakings and interactions will<br>make it more so. The judging of disputes is NOT a casual matter, which<br>everyone is capable of doing competently. Both talent and training in dispute<br>resolution is generally required, especially if you do not wish affected<br>parties to leave these encounters feeling thoroughly cheated, and resentful<br>of EQ. So...wouldn't it be interesting to have some sort of player-ratified<br>court system in EQ? Just a thought. I believe you could tap much player<br>experience to aid in such a venture. I myself, as I pointed out to your<br>GM, have quite a bit of backgound in this subject area.<br><p>The bottom line for me is that much as I love this game, I do not need<br>to participate in a virtual world where the aggravations I face in the<br>Real World are duplicated or exacerbated. I need to know that EQ will resolve<br>this issue. Please provide me with a reply at your earliest opportunity.<br><p>Sincerely,<br><br>"Selvas" on Rodcet Nife<br><p><u>E-mail to cfolz@verant.com on 4/18/2000, cc to eqmail@verant.com:</u><br><p>Mr. Folz--<br><p>I would appreciate receiving an acknowledgement that you received my<br>letter of 4/16/2000, and that a copy has been forwarded to your Mr. Wrinn<br>for his attention.<br><p>Selvas on Rodcet Nife<br><p><u>E-mail to jsmedley@verant.com on 4/19/2000, cc to gwrinn@verant.com</u>:<br><p>Mr. Smedley--<br><p>I have tried since Saturday the 16th to receive at least some acknowledgement<br>of receipt of my letter to Verant...with no response.

Lynn Carrick<br><br>Head Game Master<br><br>Verant Interactive<br><br>lcarrick@verant.com<br><br>&nbsp;<br><p><u>E-mail to lcarrick@verant.com on 4/26/2000:</u><br><p>GM Carrick--<br><p>I have posted e-mails to Mssrs. Smedley and Wrinn about this issue,<br>and yours is the only response I have yet received, of _any_ sort. You<br>are welcome to a copy of my original letter, and it is attached. I make<br>here two observations, not noted by me previously, based upon my surfing<br>of the various EQ websites and e-mail discussions with fellow game players<br>during my absence from game playing these past two weeks:<br><p>1) The new GM Seign does not generally enjoy a good reputation among<br>other game players -- his decisions are by and large considered to be arbitrary<br>and unprincipled, and it is believed that his guides are following his<br>example. My only experience with him, however, is in this one issue, and<br>I obviously was less than impressed. Traikis was held in much higher regard.<br><p>2) It seems to me that Verant staff have ignored comments or complaints<br>that haven't been publicly posted. If true, this is very poor PR. For me,<br>it has been 12 days since my problem occurred and I attempted to bring<br>it to someone's attention for response. In the meantime, there have been<br>dozens of response postings by Mr. Wrinn about issues of much lesser importance.<br>I expect to be posting my letter and questions about Verant's non-responsiveness<br>within the next couple of days, unless I receive a substantive and fair<br>reply very soon.<br><p>Nevertheless, thank you for your inquiry.<br><p>Selvas, on Rodcet Nife<br><br>&nbsp;<br><p><u>E-mail received on 4/27/2000 from lcarrick@verant.com:</u><br><p>Since I received your first email, GM Seign was released from our program.<br>As he is<br><br>no longer on Rodcet Nife, I imagine your problem is fairly well resolved.<br>If not,<br><br>feel free to contact me at your convenience. I'm afraid I did not open<br>your<br><br>attachment - could you please re-send it in the body of your email,<br>if there is more<br><br>that I should address?<br><p>Thank you,<br><br>C. Lynn Carrick<br><br>Head Game Master<br><br>Verant Interactive<br><br>lcarrick@verant.com<br><br>&nbsp;<br><p><u>E-mail to lcarrick@verant.com on 4/27/2000:</u><br><br>&nbsp;<br><p>I am not quite sure why you are having difficulty opening a standard<br>WordPerfect attachment, and I continue to be puzzled as to why Mr. Smedley<br>and Mr. Wrinn have not seen fit to provide me with a reply, but Seign's<br>departure does _nothing_ to answer my concerns, unless you are telling<br>me that he was let go for violation of the rules I cited, and you provide<br>me with a more detailed response regarding the corrections contemplated<br>overall. In any event, here is yet another copy of my letter:<br><br>&nbsp;<br><p><u>E-mail from lcarrick@verant.com on 4/28/2000:</u><br><p>I have no difficulty whatsoever opening attachments, but I choose not<br>to do so for virus protection reasons. Mr. Smedley and Mr. Wrinn receive<br>so much email in a day's time that selected issues are handed to those<br>who are in the most logical position to answer them. Although you have<br>a very good understanding of the rules, it seems there was one slight misconception<br>in the incident you described. Please let me explain. The "Play Nice Policies"<br>were, in fact, intended to prevent any player from claiming title to any<br>spawn, and when there is a contested spawn, the GM is directed to advise<br>all parties to share it in rotation, using a random roll to decide who<br>goes first, if it has been determined that the players can not or will<br>not reach an agreement on their own. The facts that one player arrived<br>first or second, or spent any length of time at a spot are irrelevant.<br>If you have any further questions about the policies, feel free to send<br>them along via email.<br><p>Regarding Seign's release, I do not feel it is appropriate to publicize<br>such matters, and will only say that his qualifications turned out to be<br>mismatched with our needs for the GM position.<br><p>Thank you,<br><br>C. Lynn Carrick<br><br>Head Game Master<br><br>Verant Interactive<br><br>lcarrick@verant.com<br><br>&nbsp;<br><p><u>E-mail to lcarrick@verant.com on 4/29/2000:</u><br><p>GM Carrick:<br><p>Your response has indeed clarified a number of issues with which I was<br>concerned, and has given me a much better understanding of Verant's gameplayer<br>relations. My observations and conclusions are as follows, which I shall<br>pass on to fellow players who have expressed interest in the matter:<br><p>-- Verant, though you, has essentially blown off my detailed assessment<br>of the problems that exist with your "play nice" policy. Saying that I<br>misunderstood, that the involved GM is now gone, and that you will not<br>comment on the reason for his departure is blatant abrogation of responsibility...but<br>IS consistent.<br><p>-- If indeed I have misunderstood Verant<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s<br>policy, then I believe this is because it was unintelligible and confusing<br>to start with. More important, however, is that as "Head GM," with apparent<br>authority to make such statements, you have now clarified "play nice" so<br>that everyone should understand the following--<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -There IS NO first-come, first-served fairness rule,<br>implied or otherwise;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - It DOESN'T MATTER how long a player has been waiting<br>for a difficult spawn in ANY circumstance;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The FIRST player to attack a mob "gets" it, according<br>to "play nice." So if a more powerful player wants <u>any</u> mob, he can<br>simply step in and attack first, regardless of who else is around, or how<br>long they've waited. VERANT THEREFORE SUPPORTS THE PREEMPTIVE STRIKE AND<br>FREE-FOR-ALL APPROACH TO SPAWN OWNERSHIP.<br><p>As I explained in my earlier letter, this means that a player with no<br>interest in fairness issues may simply appear at a spawn site and take<br>a newly spawned mob with no fear of impunity. If he is smart, he won't<br>announce his intentions, and your administrative dice-roller will not be<br>called. Once he HAS the mob, there is no foul, no fault, according to your<br>rules. Too bad for the patient questor who has waited for two hours, or<br>two days.<br><p>It is irritating for me to realize that I have been so naive. I really<br>thought that Verant seriously wanted to fix this problem, when in fact<br>it is apparent that Verant only wanted players to THINK they wanted to<br>do so. My mistake was obviously in paying too much attention to the administrative/bureaucratic<br>noise of Verant's policy-makers, rather than to the game itself...I looked<br>for rational and needed answers in the wrong place.<br><p>I will continue to play according to my principles of fairness ... that<br>is my inclination and the role I choose in the game. I will, however, ignore<br>the "play nice" policy as any meaningful codification of fairness. It is<br>now quite understandable to me why many players and guilds prefer to pursue<br>vigilante "justice," since it would frankly be irrational for any player<br>to do anything but keep his own counsel in these matters.<br><p>It occurs to me that in a larger role-playing context, GMs and Verant<br>administrators should be treated as randomly behaving, unpredictable petty<br>gods of the game...and therefore should largely be ignored and avoided,<br>when possible...and whose actions must be suffered with and tolerated when<br>not.<br><p>As for Mr. Smedley and Mr. Wrinn being too busy to "answer all posts,"<br>I simply observe that there have been literally dozens of posts by them<br>about relatively minor issues, including a number of vanity posts regarding<br>Mr. Wrinn's game playing prowess and preferences, in contrast with the<br>more substantive matters raised by me. I recognize, however, that minor<br>gods have always been known to relish flattery and to dislike having mere<br>mortals try to hold them accountable for their acts. In a peculiar and<br>perhaps predictable way, the unfolding dynamics of the game, even in its<br>irritating aspects, demonstrates that the game has taken on a life of its<br>own. Interesting.<br><p>Thank you again for your courtesy in finally providing me with a response.<br><p>Sincerely,<br><br>Selvas-- Cleric on Rodcet Nife<br><P><br><center><b><a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?mes=5582033">Respond & Debate this Article</b></a></center>

<P>
The far northern reaches of Permafrost pose a challenge to even the hardiest and most experienced travelers. Crevasses and drop holes slick with ice and covered in a thin blanket of snow routinely swallow the unwary before the dreaded dire wolfs and great white arctic bears ever have a chance to pick up a scent of their passing. Snowstorms and straight winds blowing in from the frigid Western Sea freeze exposed skins in moments or can bury entire caravans in just a few short hours. Understandably, few ever brave these dangers. But here in harmony with the snow and ice is where Barbarians prosper. Here is where the Clan of the White Bear makes their home.<br><br>The lodges of the White Bear People stood empty; no fires burned low to warm the people, no sounds were lifted by the gentle breeze blowing in from the north. The people, shrouded in a mood of somber expectation, slowly made their way to the center of their winter base camp. This was the focal point of the community where feasts were held, holy days observed, and when necessary trials were held. Even the camp dogs, vicious and ever alert to danger, sensing the people&#8217;s sobriety, milled quietly around the tents they had claimed as their own with hardly a whimper or growl.<br><br>In the center of the camp, lit by gas lamps fueled with whale oil and seal fat, stood the six Clan Elders, holy shamans hard and serious in this time of judgement. When the people had gathered, Aolis, Garggenstakken of the White Bear Clan [literally translated as He-Who-Leads-In-Plenty-And-Want] opened the gathering with the formal introduction of the Six.<br><br>&#8220;By Hammer and Blood, we meet under open sky. In the name of Truth and Justice, we seek guidance from the Tribunal of Six. Let the claimant come forward.&#8221;<br><br>A huge young man, a solid seven feet tall and pushing 300 lbs., strode forcefully into the lamplight. His face was a study of the rugged northern male &#8211; blue eyes and a strong face wreathed in a thick mane of long golden hair. Although flanked by two older men, whose experience and competence showed in their every move, the large barbarian youth was clearly used to commanding them and many more just like them.<br><br>&#8220;Who come before us seeking Justice from the Six?&#8221; asked Aolis.<br>&#8220;I, Eolric, of the Eagle Claw Clan, seek justice from the Six.&#8221;<br>&#8220;And will you abide by our decision as revealed by the Six and keep peace no matter the decree&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I will,&#8221; answered Eolric.<br>&#8220;State your claim, Eolric.&#8221;<br><br>Eolric straightened his back looming to his full seven feet and paused as if to collect his thoughts. Without doubt, this made him look the consummate heroic warrior: young, brash, and yet controlled under pressure. A canny observer might have also seen it as a means to harness his anger and indignation. Aolis inwardly smiled in understanding.<br><br>&#8220;I have traveled many leagues through the dead of winter risking much to the dangers of the Plains. I came in time for Wintersheight to feast with you and honor the joint rule of Marr and the Six. I came bearing gifts with my wife, Hallywin, and my father, Waol, son of Borgynn and Harvenstakken [He-Who-Leads-In-Strife] of the Eagle Claw People, with a full honor guard of seasoned warriors. I came to honor the alliance between our clans, as agreed during the festival of Wintersrest.<br><br>I came in good faith, and yet I and the Eagle Claw Clan were met with betrayal and dishonor. Jamki, step forward and relate your tale.&#8221;<br>One of the men standing behind Eolric took one step forward to stand at Eolric&#8217;s left shoulder. At close to six and a half feet tall, he would make a formidable opponent and yet beside his young leader he seemed small and uncomfortable with his role in so solemn a proceeding.<br><br>&#8220;I, uh, excuse me,&#8221; he said clearing his throat. &#8220;It was two nights ago, Elders, after the feast and well past the high moon. Me and Kellen were grooming our dogs and drinking up the last of our mead. Everyone else was pretty much asleep or at least in their lodges and tents. I had to, uh, wet the snow so to speak when I saw Hallywin and your man Tamurlane down behind some rocks. They were, uh, otherwise engaged, Elder, and didn&#8217;t notice me.&#8221;<br><br>Eolric&#8217;s face tightened almost imperceptibly, but his knuckles as they gripped the hilt of his sheathed two-hander would have made a white ptarmigan look dirty.<br><br>&#8220;Well, I forgot all about needing to pee, Elder, and I went straightaway to get you.&#8221;<br>&#8220;Why did not you not go to Eolric, Jamkin? Is he not your commander?&#8221; asked Aolis.<br><br>&#8220;Well, uh, we was afraid he might kill your man, sir,&#8221; replied Jamkin. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t think that would do on a holy day. Just thinkin&#8217; of him you see. Thought it&#8217;d be better if you handle things right off.&#8221;<br>&#8220;I see.&#8221;<br><br>The six shamans sat quietly digesting what they were told and <br>revealing nothing in their faces. The crowd had grown impossibly quiet, not even the creaking of boiled leather or the whispering of cloth to indicate any movement at all.<br><br>Jamkin, obviously relieved the questioning was over and so easily done, stepped back to stand behind Eolric. Eolric, pausing for a few moments for the facts to be processed by everyone present, resumed the hearing by stating his charge.<br><br>&#8220;It is commonly held among all our people that adultery deserves death, Elders. Tamurlane slept with my wife. He brought dishonor to me. He flaunted the law of the People. I ask for my due. Give Tamurlane to Marr and let this matter be decided by combat.&#8221;<br>&#8220;No!&#8221; screamed a woman from well behind the assembled people. &#8220;That is not what happened.&#8221;<br><br>The crowd stirred not at all. Aolis, taking pride in their devotion to the Six, gazed for a moment upon the crowd and then he called for the woman to be brought forward.<br><br>Hallywin, despite being haggard and worn from her two days of anxious confinement, boldly strode between two honor guards to stand proudly before the Elders and her husband. She was breathtaking even in her state. Tall and strong, she embodied the stereotypical Northern warrior maiden and then put the stereotype to shame. Without waiting for formal leave, she spoke.<br><br>&#8220;Tamurlane did not dishonor anyone. He did not know who I was or who I was married to.  I guess I could have made it plain, but I really wasn&#8217;t interested in wasting much time in small talk. And since we are on the subject, why don&#8217;t you ask Eolric where he spent that evening. I tell you this, jealousy drives this hearing, not dishonor. And if my husband had shown the least degree of faithfulness in our marr&#8230;&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;That is enough, Hallywin,&#8221; stated Eolric quietly but with a firmness that gave pause to everyone who had heard.<br>Aolis&#8217; eyebrows rose a degree.<br><br>&#8220;In light of the lady&#8217;s statements, do you stand by your charge, Eolric?&#8221; asked Aolis knowing the answer before it was said.<br>&#8220;I do.&#8221;<br><br>Aolis sighed to himself, careful to display nothing of his thoughts. Inwardly, he berated himself. Why hadn&#8217;t he seen this or something like it happening long ago? Tamurlane had been a loose cannon since he came into the Elders&#8217; care 12 years ago. He remembered that day well. Bruised and barely conscious due to a beating by his father, may the Six shower justice upon him, it was doubtful whether the boy would even make it. His father, a violent drunk but an incomparable warrior, had a long history of abusing his family. Ultimately, after almost killing Tamurlane, he lost his life to the Six in sacrifice and penance decided in a hearing much like the one Aolis was now presiding over. His mother left to return to her Clan. She never made it. Rumors of suicide abounded. Publicly, she died in an orc raid.<br>Tamurlane was given to Woodson, now an Elder and standing to his right, to nurse back to health. In the weeks after the beating, as his talent for manipulating the life force of Norrath, manna, became apparent, Woodson took over his training.<br><br>Should they have cut their losses sooner? Tamurlane showed such potential, his gift for working spells and healings was almost savant in its nature. But he was soft inside. Completely unwilling to make even the most minor of decisions and unable to open himself up to guidance from the Six as necessary to pass judgements, he labored in seeming futility without hope of becoming a full-fledged shaman of the people. Furthermore, the boy had taken to drinking excessively just like his father. At least he didn&#8217;t have that tough, old bastard&#8217;s temper. Soft, thought Aolis. Soft and lazy. The only things he seemed to apply himself to at all were sleeping with any woman willing and drinking too much.<br><br>&#8220;Bring Tamurlane forward,&#8221; Aolis said bringing himself back to the task at hand.<br><br>Tamurlane was escorted under guard from one of the small sweat lodges constructed near the site of the hearing to stand before the Elders. He had been alternating between the heat of the sweat lodge and the cold of sleeping on bare snow covered ground for the past two days in an effort by the Elders to purify him for this hearing. Truth told, he felt tired and worn, but not the least bit pure.<br><br>&#8220;You have heard the charges laid against you by Eolric, son of Borgynn, and the statements made by his wife, Hollywin?&#8221; asked Aolis.<br>&#8220;I have.&#8221;<br>&#8220;And what say you to these charges?&#8221;<br>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;<br><br>Aolos almost spluttered in disbelief. Years of training and countless hours spent schooling himself in the disciplines of the Six were the only things that kept him seemingly implacable. Even so, his eyes widened slightly. Tamurlane&#8217;s face broke into a very small smile. He had spent the last two days trying to piece together what had happened to no avail.<br><br>If he knew she was married, she could claim he seduced or even raped her. This would surely get him death, but for her punishment would probably only amount to months of confinement and a loss of her position as a Hunt Leader. <br><br>If she claimed their coupling was consensual, exile or death would occur. The Elders of the Eagle Claw Clan would decide her fate. His would be decided right then, and would probably mean a battle to the death with Eolric. Whose death was not in question. A half-trained shaman wouldn&#8217;t stand the chance of a snowflake in sunlight if pitted against that giant of man. And he could only be a couple of years older than Tamurlane&#8217;s seventeen. <br><br>But for her to say he had no knowledge of her identity at all? Something wasn&#8217;t quite right in her marriage to Eolric or else she was more honest than any person he had ever met. Looking at the distaste in her eyes as she looked up her husband indicated to Tamurlane that it wasn&#8217;t the latter.<br><br>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;The only parts of that night I can remember I don&#8217;t think Eolric wants me to repeat.&#8221;<br>Now Aolis did sigh in spite of his position and duties. Eolric had a vein on his temple that swelled to the size of an elven forearm.<br>&#8220;I want you dead, child,&#8221; Eolric growled at Tamurlane and took a step in his direction.<br><br>&#8220;Hold, &#8220; said Aolis stopping Eolric before he had taken the second. &#8220;Do not despoil this sacred hearing. Show some respect for the Six.<br><br>&#8220;We have heard enough. Stand fast and we will return with our judgement.&#8221;<br><br>With that, Aolis and the other five Elders, holy representatives of the Six on Norrath, retired to a large sweat lodge to decide the facts and pass judgement. The two hours passed slowly, a palpable feeling of anxiety intermingling amongst all present. Still, not a sound was heard and the People of the White Bear stood absolutely still as directed.<br><br>Tamurlane couldn&#8217;t decide if he was worried or not. Even at his age, death was not a stranger. How often had he known his father would not stop a beating before killing him? The worthless piece of dung always did, obviously, but the last one was damn close. How often had he thought of his mother&#8217;s death? How did it happen, or did that really matter? How often had he himself brought himself to the brink of death doing something stupid on the plains or the northern shores? Maybe death would be welcome. He definitely needed a drink.<br><br>Minutes turned into an hour which then turned into two, and finally the Elders emerged. Aolis made it short.<br><br>&#8220;We know three things not revealed during the hearing. One, Tamurlane spent the last fortnight gathering lichens for us on the northern shores. That he still does this nearly two years past what is proper reflects poorly on us, his teachers, and should bring shame upon him. He did return in time for the feast, but it was not until nearly high moon according to the perimeter guards, and so he was not present for formal introductions.<br><br>&#8220;Two, Tamurlane feels little shame for his poor judgement or lack of initiative. Simply put, he has never lied to protect himself or his reputation. Nor did the Six reveal to us any dishonesty on his part. <br>&#8220;This in and of it itself does not exonerate Tamurlane nor implicate Hallywin; however, the third truth we know, as revealed to us by the Six, is that Jamkin&#8217;s testimony is incomplete. Jamkin, do you wish to revise your testimony or shall you face the judgement of the Six?&#8221;<br>Jamkin blanched, and looked upon Eolric with eyes opened wide.<br>&#8220;Jamkin, &#8220; Aolis prodded, &#8220;speak openly and honor Truth. What did you not say?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I, uh, that is, well, sir &#8211;When I came upon your man and Hallywin, they were &#8211; uh, pretty far along in the whole, uh. Anyway, well, you see, sir, Tamurlane was kind of, uh, chanting a woman&#8217;s name over and over. Only it wasn&#8217;t Hallywin&#8217;s name, sir.&#8221;<br><br>Obviously, Eolric knew nothing of this. His man had held back; justifiably afraid, as far as Aolis could tell, of his young commander&#8217;s temper. Even with this truth revealed, though, Eolric just looked angrier.<br><br>&#8220;You mean he dishonored me and my Clan and he did not even know her name?&#8221; growled Eolric between gritted teeth. His grip tightened around the hilt of his great sword and his arm began to shake with barely controlled rage.<br><br>&#8220;Mm-hmm. We suspected something of this nature. In light of this new testimony, would you like to revise your charges, Eolric?&#8221; asked Aolis.<br><br>&#8220;I do not. I honor the Six, but I pray to Marr. I want his head. Do you grant me this?&#8221;<br>&#8220;No, Eolric, not this day.<br><br>&#8220;Let those assembled witness our judgement in silence. We, the Elders of the White Bear Clan, dutiful servants of the Six and the leaders of our people in plenty and want find the following: Tamurlane, while exercising poor judgement and once again comporting himself in a way unbefitting his station, broke no laws in coupling with Hallywin. Tamurlane acted in ignorance of her identity and position as supported by both witnesses, Jamki and Hallywin. <br><br>&#8220;Furthermore, while matters of honor and war can be settled in the blood of Marr, matters of justice, particularly when applied to an initiate shaman must be, decided by a sacred tribunal made up of clan elders. You will abide our decision, Eolric, upon pain of war between our clans and disfavor in the eyes of the Six.<br>&#8220;That said, we further find that Tamurlane has tried our patience and our hospitality long enough. You are exiled Tamurlane. You will be gone by week&#8217;s end. You are not welcome in the White Bear lodges any longer.&#8221;<br><br>They met him nearly 8 miles from the winter lodge of the White Bear Clan: Aolis and another shaman whom Tamurlane had heard of but never met, an adventurer named Stormhawk. Tamurlane had been walking the broken plain for nearly three hours, and was startled to see anyone he knew waiting for him. Besides Eolric, of course. The look on Aolis&#8217; face was grim indeed. Without preamble, Aolis spoke.<br>&#8220;The decision was not unanimous young one. One voted for Eolric and the rule of Marr.&#8221;<br>&#8220;And you came to tell me this why, Elder? You despise me so much as to make the pain of going that much harder, or are you just upset that you didn&#8217;t see Eolric take my head?&#8221;<br>&#8220;Watch your tongue, cub,&#8221; said Stormhawk stepping forward.<br>Aolis just smiled. &#8220;You don&#8217;t feel pain at leaving, young one, and I wasn&#8217;t the one who voted for your death. That was Woodson, your mentor.&#8221;<br><br>The shock of this statement left Tamurlane visibly shaken.<br>&#8220;His vote was marred by emotion obviously and as such was declared invalid, but I think it says much about you, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8220; continued Aolis. &#8220; Actually I came here to make you an offer. The Six need a representative to serve the Temple of Marr in Freeport. It is dangerous, but you can continue your studies and, if you deign to listen to the Six, you might even become a man. Do you wish to go?&#8221;<br>&#8220;Why do you offer me this, old man? No, don&#8217;t tell me. I have much potential, is that it?&#8221; Tamurlane snorted in disbelief. He had heard that his whole life, and hadn&#8217;t seen that it had done him much good.<br>&#8220;Indeed, you do. But potential means nothing if it is never realized. You need to be a man before you will ever become a shaman, or a warrior, or anything besides a rutting drunken animal. If you choose to try, leave with Stormhawk. If you do not, do not. It makes no difference to me. I offer you a chance. As far as I am concerned, it is your last.&#8221;<br><br>With that, Aolis turned to leave, but barely ten feet gone he turned to face Tamurlane once more.<br><br>&#8220;Those who deserve to sit in judgement are often the most reluctant to do so. If you can tell me how this applies to you, come back to see me. Fare well, Tamurlane. May you find what you are seeking.&#8221;

10. You've seriously considered filling out credit card applications with the <br>name of your EQ character, thinking it'd be 'cool'. <br><br>9. You buy foraged veggies, rabbit, meatpies, milk, water, bread, cupcakes, <br>iron rations, and other assorted food because you want to make sure your <br>character has a balanced diet. Yet in real life, you live on McDonalds and <br>Dominos. <br><br>8. After getting some phat loot from the City of Mist, you would think <br>nothing of running all the way to Kelethin just to sell that item. Yet when <br>your spouse, girlfriend or mom asks you to pick something up from the store, <br>you complain about how it's 'out of the way'. <br><br>7. You've actually drawn pictures of your character while at work, school, <br>detention, or whatever. <br><br>6. After fighting with your wife or girlfriend over how much you play EQ, you <br>finally get her calmed down. You wait until she sleeps, then sneak out of <br>room to play more EQ. <br><br>5. You have EQVault, Everlore, EQlizer and AllaKhazam all bookmarked. <br><br>4. The idea of being home alone, ordering pizza, having the Matrix or some <br>WWF stuff running on TV as you EQ-the-night away gives you 'warm fuzzies'. <br><br>3. You've stopped using marijuana, heroin, crack or cocaine because you were <br>afraid it would impair your abilities to play EQ effectively. <br><br>2. You had a great dream about getting that phat god or dragon loot, but when <br>you woke up and realized that it was only a dream, you got annoyed because <br>you didn't really get that loot afterall. <br><br>1. A typical day for you is-You play EQ all night. Go to work, while at work, <br>surf the net for EQ news, stop by the message boards to read more on EQ <br>happenings on your server, go home, have dinner by your PC while playing EQ, <br>tell your group you have to go AFK for 10 minutes, shower, and play EQ the <br>rest of the night.

<P>
An ebon hand moved, disturbing the sand covering it. Her entire form rose then like a zombie of the desert. Sand ran off her in rivulets, exposing blackened armour. Coughing and sputtering, Envy peered through the predawn darkness for anyone who would notice her. Namely, Wind Riders.<br><br>They had treated her relatively well during the time she was captured, considering. The biggest threat came when Sugan herself arrived at the tower. The Teir'Dal had heard the enemy's leader outside, adamantly refusing to enter on the risk that she might run a sword through her rather than look at her. Envy had cackled at that, and was amused at the silence outside afterwards. Other than that, the Lightwalkers were nearly hospitable; allowing Envy visitors even. At dusk, one had brought her a most interesting gift; a plain looking book called the Tome of Shadows. She'd only briefly gotten to read from it at the time.<br><br>Night brought their advantage. The moment the Shadow Striders ambushed the base, Envy had stepped casually into the midst of the chaos outside. She&#8217;d heard the hiss of Shannyn's voice, chanting into what was probably certain death for some unfortunate victim. A large dark wolf howled from the dunes above, and Envy had smiled at the bloodthirsty glow in the wolf's eyes... Mayana. Shadows drifted in and out of the black desert, striking and fading away like the waves of some nightmarish ocean. The dark elf stretched lazily, and pulled hidden daggers she carried in places not often searched. She flipped the blades expertly in her grasp, taking in the battle scene one last time. Blending back into the shadows of night, Envy had disappeared.<br><br>And here she came out of her hiding, cut off from the rest of the guild. Envy didn&#8217;t dare ask herself why she waited so long; that was dangerous thought. Instead she snuck closer to civilization, cringing at the sand in her armour. While peering around a corner in the dark tunnel to the Commonlands, a soft male voice startled her.<br><br>"My Lady Envy," it said. "Finally you've been found."<br><br>Envy bristled and flipped around, guarding with the daggers. Relief flooded her as the figure in black robes pulled back his cloak's hood to reveal Tdaael's face. Envy was about to speak but stopped at the necromancer's expression. Tdaael looked around him, as if expecting someone to have followed.<br><br>"Lord Faileas has been captured." he said quietly, speaking in the Teir'Dal language.<br><br>The shadow knight put her daggers away so Tdaael couldn't see her sudden trembling. Envy's face paled to a cool blue gray, but she tried to draw attention from that by shaking sand out of her hair. <br><br>Envy cursed as she did this, and paced the hall like it was a cage. "And of his amulet? Did the Wind Riders take it?" she growled.<br><br>"Sugan did, and she released the soul trapped inside." Tdaael sighed. The shadow knight cursed once more, and lashed out at the air in anger.<br><br>Landing in a crouch, she gripped her temple and hissed, "How could she have that knowledge...?" <br><br>The necromancer shook his head. "I don't know, Dark Lady, but when it was taken from him, Lord Faileas started spouting insanity&#8217;s, madness... he went catatonic shortly after.<br><br>"His last orders were to find you," Tdaael finished.<br><br>Just then several other Shadow Striders appeared. She stood as Ayna the pale darkness, Phyr the fallen goddess, and Laele the vampire approached. Envy winced, seeing the scores of wounds on the vampire's flesh as Laele knelt gingerly. Noticing the other woman's ashen expression, Laele flashed a bloodstained smile; her delicate yet deadly fangs reassuring. Envy nodded at the group of them and turned back to Tdaael.<br><br>"So." Envy began, "He's his sister's property now?" She leaned on the wall to cover her shock of the news.<br><br>Tdaael nodded. For a moment, Envy's eyes iced over with rage and she gritted her teeth. Then strangely she blinked it off, and offered a disarmingly civil smile.<br><br>"Good." she said to their amazement. After briefly judging each of her companions in turn, Envy drew them closer to speak in whispers.<br><br>She strode away from the group after they'd nodded uneasy agreeance to her words. Looking back with the dawn's first light glinting off her feral smile, Envy said, "Oh yes... And since Faileas has proven himself unworthy, I am now Mistress of the Shadows. Anyone who wishes to challenge that can speak to me."<br><br>The shadow knight laughed and disappeared.<br><br>In Neriak, the first thing Envy did was strip off her sand-filled armour and dive into the cool dark waters that flowed silently through the underground city. She glided along the pool's floor, washing away the rest of the uncomfortable grit. Resurfacing, the Teir'Dal once again noticed the Tome of Shadows peeking from her backpack.<br><br>She went quickly to her house to dress; and took the infamous scythe, Pestilence, from it's place near her altar. Wrapping the Tome in heavy waxed paper, Envy then tucked it into the pocket of a soft leather cloak that covered her face well. She left for Freeport.<br><br>Morning was leaving when she arrived at West Gate. The guards watched her dark figure carefully but made no move to intervene, after being hit with a strong blue-green gaze. Though it wasn't them she was hiding from. The militia patrolling East and West Freeport were loosely controlled by organizations Envy was associated with... it was the Paladins and Mages she had to look out for. North Freeport was the last haven of the city for true and pure hearted Lightwalkers. North Freeport was where Faileas was being held.<br><br>Drifting quietly past the arched doorway to the Academy of Arcane Science's courtyard, Envy joined a crowd and entered North Freeport. She inconspicuously slipped past buildings and shops when suddenly a hand shot forth and pulled back her hood. The shadow knight heard a familiar sliding of metal as the guard drew his sword.<br><br>"Dark elf!!" he shouted triumphantly, "Your foul deeds have..." He paused and glanced around.<br><br>Envy was gone.<br><br>Having dashed inside a convenient inn and up the stairs before the owner could protest, she quickly swung herself out a window to the rooftop. Here, Envy watched the streets below and the guards searching through the throngs of people for her in vain. A sudden gust of wind billowed out her black cloak, drawing her eyes skyward. Black clouds of a coming storm mottled the sunshine, coating the city with eerily sharp areas of brilliant light and dark shadow. The Teir'Dal covered her face again and matched the speed of the clouds&#8217; shadows, leaping with feline ease from roof to roof.<br><br>She stopped on a white wall overlooking the precinct known as the Temple of Marr. Sensing something from a room close to her, Envy waited for the paladin sentry to move on and then dropped quietly to the balcony. She peeked in and gasped, seeing a dark figure standing inside. Faileas' black armour nearly sucked in the very light around it, the cape wisping slightly in a breeze. But there was no Faileas in it. The T'Druis family sword she had given him hung nearby on a rack, partially wrapped in strange cloth. With a smirk, Envy realized the paladins probably wouldn't deign touching it themselves. 'Innoruuk knows how many of their brethren coat that sword,' she thought, laughing.<br><br>A noise startled her from such pleasant thoughts, and she made haste for the wall outside. Frowning, Envy wondered if they were holding him in the Hall of Truth. She turned and crouched to jump, but suddenly a voice came from her left... almost causing her to fall.<br><br>"Envy," it whispered.<br><br>She sniffed the air and searched warily, but found nothing. Eyes narrowed with suspicion, the Teir'Dal slithered in the direction, ready to attack. She found nothing of the whisperer, but gathered around a building in the alley opposing her was a small group of about six onlookers. They appeared to be spying through a small barred window, belonging to a room that was half underground. The basement cell of some guild house?<br><br>The building was at least two stories above ground, so Envy looked for guards before dropping to the street. Joining the group, she listened to their subdued chatter while trying to get a look in the ground-level window. Envy's heartbeat sped up, definitely sensing the presence of Faileas' bloodline nearby.<br><br>"... and good riddance, too, I say." a half elf with hair almost as white as Envy's quietly murmured. "About time they did something. Only wish half the militia and those scoundrels sneaking about underground were executed with him..." <br><br>She spoke hastily and looked behind her as she did it; shifting in her dark blue armour. They were all speaking with utmost care, as if something dangerous would catch them.<br><br>"Are you sure he's down there? That it's really THE Lord Faileas?" asked a human dressed in plain brown robes.<br><br>"Aye," the half elf answered. "Saw him arrested just last night. Wasn't a bit happy about it, either. Threw some sort of fit, and got all quiet. Downright disturbing, it was." <br><br>Another human nodded, his chainmail tinkling slightly. "Course it's him!" he frowned. "Look for yourself! But watch out, I wouldn'a meet 'is eyes if I were you... he knows black magick, an' el prolly take your soul for it."<br><br>The bunch of them looked wide-eyed at each other for a silent uneasy moment. The sound of a door opening in the front of the building sent them scuttling to look busy or as if just passing. Envy ducked behind a large barrel and watched. A patch of sunlight played harbinger to a red headed girl in full steel plate. She walked slowly, reading a letter and shaking her head in gentle exasperation. She stretched in the sunlight, accentuated by a light breeze. The Teir'Dal cringed further behind the barrel and hissed at the sight. Sugan. There was no way she'd stand a chance if Sugan spotted her here&#8230;<br><br>One member of the group from before passed the paladin and bowed reverently. "Good day, Lady Sugan!" he said brightly. "How are you this fine day?"<br><br>Sugan smiled at the man. "I'm doing just fine today, sir. And I appreciate your asking. Busy day in town?"<br><br>"Oh, little more than usual..." he prattled on and on, "... and how would your brother be?" the man asked as a seeming afterthought. Envy smiled at his hypocrisy of friendliness.<br><br>Sugan wasn't thrown at all by the question. "He'll be fine, I think... still won't speak to me, but listens well enough. If you'll excuse me, sir, I need to make an announcement soon at the Theatre. Join me if you like."<br><br>The two of them strolled off. A few people watched and then wandered back to the cell window, chattering gossip still. Envy crept out of her spot warily.<br><br>"Such a pity... lovely girl. I'd be ashamed of my family too, if He was in it," said a short woman, obviously a wood elf.<br><br>"Shh!" waved the half elf, "Don't let her hear you, that would be so rude!"<br><br>"Oh no," said the man in chainmail. "It's not her we have to worry about. There are far worse creatures to deal with when you speak an ill word of the great 'Lord' Faileas." He bowed in mock grandeur at the word Lord, and snorted a laugh.<br><br>"That's right," Envy spoke up. They all turned to her as she pulled her hood back. "Creatures like me."<br><br>"Gods, a dark elf!" the man spat, "A shadow knight!"<br><br>The half elf's violet eyes dilated, finally seeing the size of the scythe. "That's Envy."<br><br>"H-have you come to set your Faileas free, dark one?" stuttered the wood elf. "There's no way you'd succeed. The house is filled with Wind Riders."<br><br>Envy bared her teeth. "Let me be the one to decide that." she snapped. "Now get out of here."<br><br>She swung Pestilence down dangerously close to the wood elf's face, missing only on purpose. The bunch of them disappeared quickly. Envy stood quietly until they had all scuttled away, and knelt down to peer into the darkness behind the barred window. She hesitated before speaking.<br><br>"Faileas," Envy said in a polished tone, "Master. I have come, can you hear me?"<br><br>From the shadows within, a pair of eyes flashed brilliant blood red to acknowledge her presence.<br><br>&#8220;Envy,&#8221; whispered a voice like silk wrapped steel. It was the same voice that had guided her here. The dark elf marveled at this revelation for a moment, but her thoughts were interrupted when Faileas spoke again.<br><br>&#8220;You risked much to come here, my apprentice. How&#8230; unbecoming of such an upstanding Teir&#8217;Dal.&#8221; A soft chuckle came from the shadows; a sound that could have passed for a low growl.<br><br>Narrowing her eyes a bit, Envy tried to hear the context between his words. &#8216;Hopeless human,&#8217; she thought, and shook her head.<br><br>She said, &#8220;No more than what you risked in the attempt to free me. That was foolish, Lord Faileas. I could have taken care of it myself. It is you who are to be protected at all costs, and now look. You&#8217;re in the hands of Lightwalkers-&#8220;<br><br>&#8220;I do as I see fit, Envy. You above all know the most powerful path is also the most difficult.&#8221; Faileas snapped, &#8220;Do not attempt to correct me.&#8221;<br><br>By instinct, as if he were standing before her instead of locked in a dark cage, Envy bowed her head. &#8220;Yes, Lord Faileas.&#8221;<br><br>A long, awkward moment passed before she spoke again. &#8220;I&#8230; can only suppose that you know of my plan so far. The Shadow Striders should give little resistance to my leadership.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I always know your plans. A multifaceted idea, this. Impressive.&#8221; It sounded as if Faileas was smiling.<br><br>Again, Envy felt there was something double edged in his words. She frowned at her inability to catch it. Faileas had the rare talent of being able to infuriate her&#8230; when it suited him.<br><br>Biting her lip to subdue the anger, Envy took the book wrapped in waxpaper from her cloak. &#8220;I brought you a gift, Faileas. Something that, I hope, will at least ease your boredom during this. The Tome of Shadows.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;The Tome of Shadows? That&#8217;s not the easiest book to acquire. Thank you, Dark Lady.&#8221; Faileas said. <br><br>Envy preened slightly at the title, and noticed that he&#8217;d moved closer to the barred window. The blood red metal plates covering Faileas&#8217; arms and all but the palms of his hands were the only parts of his shadow knight armour that he still wore. Those pieces couldn&#8217;t be removed, and were known as the Armour of Souls for a reason. She could see the dim outline of his hair and cheekbone, the glint of teeth, and his dark green eyes. <br><br>&#8216;Handsome,&#8217; The dark elf admitted to herself, &#8216;&#8230;for a human.&#8217;<br><br>She pushed the wrapped tome through the bars, purposefully brushing the skin of Faileas&#8217; hand as she gave it to him. Somewhere deep inside, Envy reveled in the power of this; flirting with something she&#8217;d never dared to before. It was a sort of subtle victory for the most primitive female part of her. An establishment of dominance.<br><br>And as soon as the smile graced her lips, it was wiped off. A steel claw wrapped around her wrist tightly, and she let out a small cry of surprise. Faileas&#8217; eyes flashed red once more.<br><br>&#8220;Curiosity,&#8221; he said with a feral smile, &#8220;won&#8217;t kill the cat as surely as Ambition.&#8221;<br><br>Envy hissed as the points of his sharp gloved fingertips dug into her skin. Faileas gave her hand a gentle and polite kiss.<br><br>&#8220;Thank you again, Dark Lady.&#8221; He laughed, &#8220;Now begone. The guards are coming.&#8221;<br><br>She glanced up at the empty alley and back again at Faileas, tugging free of his grasp. Five beads of violet blood welled up and rolled across her dark indigo skin. The Teir&#8217;Dal cursed in her native tongue as she shimmied up the barrel and onto the roof of the adjacent building. Just then an afternoon shadow rounded the corner of the alley, and as Faileas predicted, a Paladin guard appeared with sword drawn. Shaking her head incredulously, Envy snuck back to West Freeport.<br><br>As she strolled leisurely down the dirty street, Envy mentally debated with herself about the next course of action. The night&#8217;s events were already planned, as she intended to return for the dark armour and sword that the Wind Riders had confiscated. Further than that however&#8230; well, her brief experience with Faileas had given her ideas.<br><br>Suddenly, a familiar voice drifted close and Envy hugged the wall, perking her ears. Sugan was at the Theatre of the Tranquil with a good number of people listening to her. The shadow knight peered into the area cautiously. Sure enough, Faileas&#8217; twin sister was taking center stage in her usual obliviously arrogant way. Envy spit at the way the gods of light seemed to bless her; kept her stupidly untouchable. The human&#8217;s red hair glowed with blinding sunlight, and along with the shining armour Sugan truly played a holy knight for the people. Disgusting.<br><br>Her normal seething at the Wind Riders&#8217; leader satiated, Envy focused on what was being said.<br><br>&#8220;&#8230;a deviously intelligent man, my friends, so don't be fooled by his ploys.&#8221; Sugan preached. &#8220;And do not be fooled into showing sympathy for his minions, either. Many of them are pleading &#8216;innocent&#8217; as it were, claiming it's our arrogance that has decided Faileas can not go free.&#8221;<br><br>&#8216;Innoruuk spare me,&#8217; Envy thought bitterly, &#8216;Whoever told you that was brilliant. Now if you were only capable of learning&#8230;&#8217;<br><br>Just as if she&#8217;d said it out loud, Sugan paused and looked directly at the dark elf. Envy could see the angry flash of lightning in her eyes even with the distance. Unflinching, the shadow knight channeled pure Hatred right back. A reflexive dare.<br><br>Sugan opted to continue her speech but kept her gaze on Envy for a long time, as if she was speaking to only her. &#8220;I will tell you why Faileas can not go free. He is inflicted with a curse of madness, one that allows him to order the deaths of innocents with a wave of the hand. One that tells him he is to murder, manipulate, and enslave the world in the name of the Plaguebringer.&#8221;<br><br>The charismatic paladin shifted back to attending her audience, &#8220;If he ever had a conscience about this, it was defied. Not only has he done these things himself, but he leads others to follow in his footsteps. He is corruption and defilement, and cannot be tolerated.<br><br>&#8220;Faileas can not go free because he murdered countless Knights of Thunder, and Clerics of Life in Qeynos, only a few of which could be resurrected. He orchestrated the deaths of many, many others, including the paladin Koramur. He organized and assisted in attacking Silveril, which resulted in the magical conception of her children, Silverann, Stormangell, and Annaconda; against her will. He assisted in the death and resurrection of Laraden, who was then enslaved as an unholy creature. He kidnapped and tortured Jamier D'Phoenix. He stalked and attempted to kidnap Lillaie, and encouraged her harassment by his minions. He kidnapped Avari, exchanging him for a blood sacrifice by my officer, Sirynn... and even now is condoning Avari's enslavement to his apprentice, Envy&#8230;&#8221;<br><br>The dark elf rolled her eyes and muttered, &#8220;If only she knew the half of it.&#8221;<br><br>Sugan was still yet counting off her brother&#8217;s sins. Her fervor was affecting the people exactly the way it was meant to. &#8220;He purposefully passed on the curse of our family to Sirynn, while resurrecting him here in Freeport. He held Wind Riders Daks and Thryn hostage, forcing them to battle each other to the death for his amusement.&#8221;<br><br>&#8216;Now that&#8217;s not true,&#8217; thought Envy gleefully, &#8216;It amused everyone there.&#8217;<br><br>&#8220;He then resurrected Thryn in much the same manner as Sirynn... again, infecting Thryn with the Imshee'Cro curse. He lead the Shadow Striders in the Dark Alliance's attack on Ak'Anon, resulting in mass death of countless Gnomes, and quite a few High elves. He assisted the daughter of Innoruuk, Lanys T'Vyl, and her followers in murdering innocent Halflings&#8230;&#8221;<br><br>The shadow knight sighed. &#8216;No, Faileas assisted ME in assisting the Lady T&#8217;Vyl,&#8217; she thought.<br><br>Sugan continued, &#8220;He manipulated the servitude of my officer, Sorcere Trueheart, which resulted in the death of our beloved Ralnia. <br><br>&#8220;Faileas murdered Stormangel. He murdered Canelon. He murdered the brother of my officer, Laneni Taciturn. Not only were they killed, but their souls taken for his own gain of power. He kidnapped me, subjected me to the whims of Bertoxxulous in the realm of Disease, and had me betray my own. I was forced to reveal the secrets of the Temple of Thunder and Temple of Marr to the miscreants of the Dismal Rage, and forced to wage battles against my own people. And, he knowingly released the demon Malgorm Azzothoth into our lands.&#8221;<br><br>&#8216;Amen,&#8217; Envy thought, feeling the overwhelming urge to applaud. Sugan took a short step back to contemplate the crowd's stunned silence, and let her eyes rest on many of them to relay her pain.<br><br>Manipulation at it&#8217;s finest, the Teir&#8217;Dal observed.<br><br>The redhead took a slow breath, and continued with gentle insistence. &#8221;Faileas is not only guilty of these crimes, but he's proud of them. Following in the footsteps of our father, he continues to strike our name down with evil. It was my vow long ago, to stop him and restore honour to our name, and now I am closer to that than ever before&#8230;&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Impetuous Lightwalker,&#8221; growled Envy quietly, &#8220;you have no idea what you are close to.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;&#8230;Karana have mercy on his soul,&#8221; Sugan said, &#8220;Those of you who think I am being harsh, remember. The People of Ak'Anon, and of Rivervale... even my own Temple of Thunder would not even have spared him this long. I do so out of love, faith, and respect. Condemn me if you will, but I follow my heart.<br><br>&#8220;May the Rainkeeper bless your lives with prosperity. Good day.&#8221; The paladin stepped down and parted the crowd in her exit. Envy took this as her cue to leave too. Despite her earlier animosity, she knew it was stupid to risk facing Sugan in the human town. <br><br>Outside of West Gate the dark elf was relieved to discover that Sugan wasn&#8217;t pursuing her. She removed her hood again and laughed at the confused sky. As if trying to prove themselves worthy to either paladin or shadow knight, the black clouds finally overtook the sun and low thunder rolled on the horizon.<br><br>&#8216;Ambition indeed, my malevolent Lord Faileas.&#8217; Envy thought. Her plans were decided at that moment. Envy was sick of humans, and she departed to scheme on long overdue vengeance.

With the addition of the Iksar race, there is much debate as to why Iksar are KOS to all other races. This is an attempt to address this issue by looking at historical events in our world to understand why the Iksar are KOS to all of Norrath. <br><br>OK. Look at the discovery of Kunark from this angle. When the Europeans discovered the Americas, they encountered Indians, Aztecs, Incas, Mayans, and more. The natives had established cities, especially the Incas, Aztecs and Mayans. You draw a comparison to Cabilis here. When the Europeans explored the new continent, they found a culture foreign and barbaric to them. They witnessed virgin sacrifices, the killing of a woman every morning to make the sun rise, the drinking of blood, and more. The Europeans did not say, "Hey, go board our ships and check out Europe. It's a neat place." The Europeans slaughtered them. It was very rare for an American Indian to travel to Europe and walk around freely. It was until the late 1500s/early 1600s before American Indians were taken to England under the guise of freedom (Read the factual tale of Pocahontas). What I am getting at here is that, Iksar would naturally be KOS in all foreign lands, at least for a long period. If, the Aztecs got on a ship and traveled to London, they would probably be imprisoned. Or, if a whole bunch of Powhatan Indians ran to Jamestown to try to get on a ship to England, they would have been captured or killed. You can draw a parallel to a bunch of Iksar attempting to get on the boat at Firiona Vie. They are killed. <br><br>We do not have to look only at the "discovery of the New World" to understand why Iksars are KOS. Just look at Feudal Japan. The governments prohibited all contact with Europeans and others. Christians were killed when they came to the docks. It was not until President Millard Filmore sent warships to Japan, demanding they open up, that Europeans were safe to travel there. On the other hand, look at Africa. Not only were tribes KOS to each other, but Whites were KOS to everyone. European outposts for the slave trade were established on the coast, but rarely did Europeans travel into the mainland. <br><br>In addition to this, the fact that one race worships the same religion as the other does not matter. WWI and WWII had nations whose foundations are based in Christianity on both sides. In Mid-evil Europe, Christianity did not keep the British and the French from fighting. <br><br>To carry all this further, just because you are "Good" or "Evil", does not mean you will like other people of the same alignment. Whether Native Americans, Aztecs or Incas were "evil" or not is in the eye of the beholder. Native Americans sure as hell thought the Europeans were evil when they began slaughtering them (Yes, some Indian nations were at times at peace with Europeans, but not for ever). Iksar consider the other races to be "evil" because they seek to invade their homeland. The Ogres, Elves, Humans, ET al. are trying to take what remains of the once great Iksar empire. The Humans, Elves, Ogres, etc. see the Iksar trying to rebuild the Iksar Empire. They fear domination too. I am not saying that Indians, Aztecs, Africans or Japanese are like the Iksars, nor am I saying that they are "evil". I am just using these historical events to illustrate the current situation on Norrath. <br><br>-Taronga Kingfisher

Chapter 2<br><br>&#8220;&#8230; and the violence escalates with each day.   We have sent word to Rivervale for assistance,  but the trek from Freeport to Rivervale grows more dangerous each day.  We have yet to receive any response.&#8221;  Crayth Nalison reported via magic communications portal.<br><br>Lady Jeyna Sleighhill sat among the Council of Elders in Felwithe as they listened to Paladin Crayth Nalison&#8217;s report.    It has been seven years since the death of Jeyna Sleighhill&#8217;s husband, Seron.   In that time,  the Sleighhill family has been honoured by being declared nobility by the Elven Council of Elders out of respect for Seron Sleighhill and his life&#8217;s work against the evils of Norrath.    Seron&#8217;s body was returned to Faydark and buried in the Elven temple of nobles.  During the funeral service,  Jeyna Sleighhill gave new meaning to the name &#8220;Ocean of Tears.&#8221;  However, true to Seron&#8217;s word,  young Darien Sleighhill was growing up strong.  Already at a young age,  Seron Sleighhill possessed an uncanny ability in the arts of Melee combat and some skill in the Clerical arts.  The council predicted Darien Sleighhill would become a fine Paladin,  however,  Jeyna sensed something different in her son that the others could not see. <br><br>&#8220;The news is indeed grim.&#8221; Jonark Crablinyth,  high council leader remarked.   &#8220;Has word been sent to the High Humans in Erudin?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;It has,  my liege.&#8221;  Crayth Nalison reported grimly.  &#8220;However,  the Erudites have informed me that they are having serious problems with the Erudite Heretics.   The Humans in Freeport face a similar problem, as human Necromancers and Shadow Knights continue to assist the Teir&#8217;dal in East Commons.   There has been no luck searching out the Human Necromancer or Shadow Knight guilds here in Freeport.&#8221;<br><br>The council began to talk amongst themselves.   The news was indeed grim in Antonica.  The Teir&#8217;dal gained in strength with each passing day.  Like an unstoppable avalanche in the mountains of Everfrost Peak,  anything in the path of the Teir&#8217;dal was overrun and destroyed.  Finally,  council member Jonas Saradin, high mage responded.<br><br>&#8220;We will send additional Elven warriors and mages to Antonica.   They will arrive in five days.   In the meantime,  maintain your surveillance and report to the Council should anything significant arise.  May Tunare watch over you.&#8221;  Jonas Saradin replied.<br><br>Crayth Nalison gave a slight bow,  as the magical communications portal shimmered then closed.   The Council hall was deathly silent.  The news had not been good over in Antonica.   It seemed as if nothing did any good against the Dark Elves.   It would only be a matter of time before they breached the security of the island of Faydwer.   Finally,  Jeyna Sleighhill broke the silence.<br><br>&#8220;The Emerald Warriors should be informed&#8230;  as should the Magic Guild here in Felwithe&#8230;&#8221;  Jeyna Sleighhill said with a heavy heart.  <br><br>&#8220;I will inform my fellow mages.&#8221;  Jonas Saradin said grimly.  The council hall fell silent again.  The Elven High Council had been stunned silent.  Suddenly,  the council doors burst open, as young Darien Sleighhill ran into the hall with weapon drawn.<br><br>&#8220;Come back here and I will let you taste my blade!  Hee hee hee!&#8221;   Darien Sleighhill exclaimed gleefully.<br><br>&#8220;Young Lord Sleighhill&#8230; what is the meaning of this?&#8221;  Jonark Crablinyth asked.<br><br>&#8220;Darien!  You cannot just barge into the Council hall while a meeting is in session.  How many times have I told you?&#8221;  Jeyna Sleighhill said sternly to her over-energetic son.<br><br>&#8220;But Mother&#8230; I could have sworn that I saw an orc pawn run in here.&#8221; Darien protested.<br><br>&#8220;I assure you,  young Darien.  There are no orcs in this chamber.&#8221;  Jonas Saradin said in the lowest of tones.   This was not the first time that young Darien let his imagination get the better of him.<br><br>&#8220;Darien,  run along and play outside.  Do not wander too far from the city guards.   I expect you home in time for supper though.  Do not be late.&#8221;   Jeyna told her son.<br><br>&#8220;Yes mother.&#8221;  Darien replied reluctantly as he exited the Council hall.   <br><br>&#8220;I am so terribly sorry&#8230;.&#8221;  Jeyna began to apologize.   Jonark Crablinyth dismissed her with his hand.<br><br>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be.  Never before have I seen such fighting spirit in one so young.  Your son is very special.&#8221; Jonark remarked.<br><br>&#8220;He must have gotten it from his father&#8230;.&#8221; Jeyna replied as her thoughts began to drift to Seron.<br><br>	Darien stormed out of Felwithe and kicked the dirt at his feet.  He could have sworn that he saw a Crushbone Orc Pawn running through the halls of Felwithe.   The image had been so clear.   As clear as the crystal blue sky that blanketed Faydwer this sunny day.   This was not the first time that Darien saw things that were not really there,  yet Darien insisted that what he saw was real.  Two months ago,  Darien ran into the council hall claiming that Ogres and Trolls had reached the shores of Butcherblock.  When a scouting party was sent,  no trace of such a force was found.   Half a year ago,  Darien claimed to have saw Lord Nafagen attacking Kelethin and burning the city to the ground.   Of course,  the great wyrm was nowhere near the wood elf city when a scout was sent to investigate.  <br><br>&#8220;Stupid council&#8230;.  Always having meetings&#8230; what good do they do anyway.&#8221;  Darien grumbled as he stomped through the mud.   Suddenly,  Darien heard a cry for help.  He looked around for the city guards,  but they were nowhere in sight.    Darien followed the sound of the cries and came upon a Crushbone Orc Pawn attacking a young elven female,  who was about Darien&#8217;s age,  perhaps slightly younger.  At first,  Darien shook his head and rubbed his eyes,  thinking he was over-imagining again.   However,  the image looked so real.  He had to do something.  Darien drew his sword and his shield.  He had never fought a real orc before.  His mother would not allow it.<br><br>&#8220;Stick to bats and wasps&#8230;.&#8221;  Jeyna had warned him sternly.   But it was time now to test his skills against a stronger opponent.    The orc raised his fist high in the air and prepared to bring it down on the elven female&#8217;s fragile head.   <br><br>&#8220;Me crush you now puny elf.  Muahahahahaha&#8221;  the orc laughed.<br><br>Darien stopped the blow with his shield and kicked the orc squarely in the gut.  The orc doubled over in pain<br><br>&#8220;Argh!  Elves like you have ruined your land!  You&#8217;ll not ruin mine!&#8221;  the orc taunted as he prepared to strike at Darien.<br><br>Darien assumed a defensive posture and parried the orc&#8217;s attacks with relative ease.  As the orc began to tire from swinging with all his might against his elven foe,  Darien went on the offensive.  He brought his sword down hard across the orc&#8217;s torso and sliced it open.  Blood spilled on the soil as the orc screamed in pain and grabbed at his open wound.   Suddenly,  a blast of frost struck the orc and brought him to his knees.   Sensing an opportunity to finish off his enemy,  Darien swung his sword and sliced off the orc&#8217;s head clean off his body.  The orc slumped to the ground lifeless.   Behind Darien,  the young elven female was panting heavily, with one hand raised in front of her.  It was obvious to Darien that the frost bolt had come from her.<br><br>&#8220;Thank you&#8221; Darien said.<br><br>&#8220;No thank you.  My name&#8217;s Eralyn Goldshadow. Apprentice wizard.&#8221;  Replied the elf.<br><br>&#8220;I&#8217;m Darien.  Darien Sleighhill.  What are you doing so far from the city guards?&#8221;  Darien asked.<br><br>&#8220;I wanted to pick some flowers for my mother.   I became kind of lost&#8230;&#8221;  Eralyn said.   &#8220;Do you know where we are?&#8221;<br><br>Darien looked around.  His surroundings were unfamiliar<br><br>&#8220;No,  I don&#8217;t.  I don&#8217;t know how to get back home.&#8221;  Darien said glumly.  Suddenly,  he heard a rustling in the bush.   <br><br>&#8220;Did you hear that?&#8221;  Darien asked?<br><br>&#8220;No,  what?&#8221;  Eralyn said with concern.  &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;<br>&#8220;Ssshh&#8230;&#8221;  Darien hushed.   Suddenly,  a vision came before Darien&#8217;s eyes.  He was several orcs striking down at Eralyn and himself.   When Darien&#8217;s regular vision return,  Eralyn&#8217;s eyes were wide with fear.  <br><br>&#8220;Look out!&#8221;  Eralyn screamed<br><br>The last thing Darien felt was the end of a mace come crashing down on his head.<br><br>	Darien was slowly regaining consciousness.   He struggled to move,  but he found himself tied down to a table.  Surrounding him were three Crushbone Orc Legionnaires.   Eralyn was tied to a table next to him,  a bloody mess.   Darien noticed however that her midsection was rising and falling slowly.  She was still breathing,  she was still alive.   Darien struggled against his restraints and tried to free himself.<br><br>&#8220;Do not move, elf,  or me crush your head again.&#8221;  The Orc Legionnaire warned.  &#8220;You our prisoner in Crushbone now.   You do what we say.&#8221;<br><br>The door to the room opened, as a Teir&#8217;dal in fine ornamental robes entered the room.<br><br>&#8220;Good day children.  My name is Ambassador D&#8217;vinn.   You are in Emperor Crush&#8217;s castle.  You do know who Emperor Crush is,  don&#8217;t you?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I tire of listening to you speak.  My people will come for me, and when they do,  you will all be sorry&#8230;&#8221;  Darien spat at the Dark Elf. <br><br>&#8220;You know what,  my little elven friend?   We are counting on it.&#8221;  Ambassador D&#8217;vinn replied.   D&#8217;vinn then made a gesture with his hand at a mirror on the wall.   An image formed in the mirror.<br><br>&#8220;Yes,  what is it?&#8221;  the Dark Elf in the mirror asked.  Darien turned to look at the mirror.  The elf in the mirror was young,  barely out of his teens.  Darien did not know this elf,  but the elf seemed strangely familiar to him&#8230;<br><br>&#8220;Lord D&#8217;eewlay.

<P>
I, Ezno Eyebiter, High Scholar of the Heroes of the Avatar scribe this account of our initial expeditions to the continent of Kunark so that future Heroes may study this strange new land to help in their exploration of it. <br><br>Impatiently we awaited the building of the outpost.  During this time of construction, we sent our chief scout, Molan Toejam, to do some initial exploration of this land and bring us word of his discoveries.  Many dangerous creatures he faced in bringing us this information, and bravely he fought on this new land as he explored its secrets.  When our faithful druid finally made his way back to us it was with great gain, and with great loss.  <br><br>In a great battle with a mountain giant encountered in the Dreadlands, our scout was suffered a great injury that has left his right leg severely mangled.  We thank the gods in allowing his final spell, a spell of succor, to succeed in bringing him home alive.   Thus far, our clerics have been able to do nothing for the injury and we all fear his days of exploration have ended.  However, many of us do not give up hope that new healing spells may be uncovered that can heal his injury and restore his full health to us.<br><br>I spent weeks with Molan, one of my dearest halfling friends, speaking of his explorations in the new lands.  In these talks I gathered that two important discoveries had been made: <br><br>The first, and most exciting to one of the mystical arts, are the ruins of the Combine Empire.   Though not certain, through descriptions that were given to me, I believe we may have found the ancient seat of power of the largest and greatest civilization that graced the face of Norrath.   <br><br>The second, and most suprising, discovery was of a new race of lizard-like men known as the Iskar.  These creatures seem highly intelligent and yet barbaric at the same time.  Their viciousness and cruelty seems to know no bounds, and yet they seem to be a highly organized and close knit society where traits such as dishonesty and dishonor have no place.   Molan was able to view their city from a distance and even catch glimpse of several in his travels.  Most information, however, has come from the initial elven explorers who first made contact with the Iskar and who first felt their wrath.   <br><br>If all reports are correct, these two discoveries are connected.  Most of the ruins found scattered about the continent point towards one startling conclusion.  The combine empire was once ruled by these very same Iskar.  It is a startling discovery which only leads to more questions.  If these are the descendents of the great rulers of that empire, what happened to bring them to their current state?   These questions would have to wait until we could do more exploration.<br><br>Finally, the day had arrived and our first real excursion unit had departed for the new lands.  After much heated discussion, we decided to send a very small band of adventurers in our initial unit to gather more information.  The barbarians Kardadar and Sarita, a warrior and shaman, were chosen for this.  I was delighted to also be included in this group.   <br><br>We sailed upon a huge elven war galley to the outpost and were greeted by the elven guards at the docks.  We made our way around the outpost, which is still under construction, and found ourselves lodging for the night.  Early in the morning  I was greeted by a very eager Kard who insisted we immediately set out for parts unknown and find glorious battle.  <br><br>Having heard that agents of Mistmoore were spotted in the forests outside of the outpost, we set off through the tunnels to investigate.  We joined up with Cron and Gildon of the Highland Army on the beach and quickly spotted the evil spider-like beings that Mayong had sent.  <br><br>The beasts are an abomination, obviously constructs of a dark and evil magic which has combined the torso of a dark elf with the body of a spider.  The foul beasts were quick to attack and fought with fang and magic.   After a chaotic melee we finally beat back their forces and were able to treat our wounded.  We had slain many of the abominations, but still spotted many more moving under the trees.   <br><br>We decided to send Kardadar on a quick scouting run to survey the area.   A few hours later we were greeted by a great yell and the sight of an injured Kard running from another large force of the spiders.  A  quick prayer of healing from Gildon saved our barbarian friend from certain death.  The rest of us jumped to our feet and engaged the spiders, Cron singing a soothing song to mesmerise a few as Sarita, a newly healed Kard and myself sprang into battle with the rest.   Again, we were successful in beating them back.  <br><br>We set up a guarded camp for the night and Kard informed us of another great evil lying further into the woodlands.  A tribe of evil frogloks had taken up residence in some ruins a few leagues from the outpost.  The next morning, Kard led us to this place.  The trip was beautiful, passing under the great oaks and traveling alongside a trickling stream, but otherwise uneventful as we were masked in a cloak of invisibility for our travels.  Finally, near mid day, we made it to the ruins and engaged the frogloks.  We battled their knights with our sword and their shamans with our magic and, after a grueling melee, had slain over two dozen of the enemy and forced the rest to retreat.   <br><br>It was nearing evening, thus we moved ourselves a safe distance from the ruins and setup another guarded camp.   The next morning, after a heated discussion where Kard demanded to go slay more of the frogloks, Sarita and I were able to calm him enough to follow Cron&#8217;s suggestion of reporting back to the outpost our findings.  Through the use of his bardic powers, we were able to quickly travel back to the outpost and give our reports to an elven captain.  <br><br>I must admit, after the two day excursion, I spent my night drinking much wine and felt myself feeling unwell the following morning.  With great sadness, I was forced to inform my friends that I must rest for the day to meet my cousins as they arrived on the docks.<br><br>Later that evening I was reunited with my cousins, Nizzudin Nosebiter and Ellaar Earbiter, all of the House of Bite.  We sat around the tavern that night as I told them stories of what I had witnessed and we pored over more of the notes Molan had brought back with him.  We decided that, upon the morrow, we would journey into the Dreadlands.  <br><br>We set out through the tunnel early that morning.  We emerged onto the beach to find a barbarian staring down several of the spider creatures I had fought in the days previous.  Jumping to the shaman&#8217;s aid, we threw a volley of spells at the fiends and, aided by the barbarian&#8217;s shaman magic, we were able to quickly dispatch them.   Thus, we met Stinkymaw and, after a brief discussion, he agreed to travel to the Dreadlands with us.  Aided by our spells of invisibility and his granting of the spirit of the wolf, we were able to quickly make our way to this new land.  <br><br>We emerged from the tunnel into the Dreadlands and were immediately jumped by a blue devil born not out of myth or legend, but out of our nightmares.   My air elemental was able to hold the fiend at bay as I struck it with summoned swords, Nizzudin with the heat of flames, Stinky with the cold of Everfrost and Ellaar attacked its mind.   After a great magical battle the beast was slain and we were able to take our first good look at the Dreadlands.<br><br>How can I describe this strange new land?  The trees waver in the distance high atop grassy hills.  The beasts, both fantastic and vicious, roam the land making travel perilous.  As we scouted out the area we met up with two other brave adventurers, Trees Smokem and Vump of the famous House of Ump.   Joining up with these two druids, we made our way towards some ruins we spotted in the distance.   <br><br>As we came upon the ruins, we spotted skeletal lizardmen inside.  This confirmed what our research had suspected, the foul Iskar practiced the heretical art of Necromancy.   Using our newfound friends ability to use nature against them, we lured the skeletal figures outside one by one and struck them down with our magic.   <br><br>As nightfall approached, we decided to set up camp not far from the ruins.  We set up a rotation for guarding the camp and I lay down to sleep as Trees took the first watch.  Just as I had drifted off to sleep I was jolted awake by the cries of battle.  A Mountain Giant had wandered into our camp and attacked Trees.   Vump, being quick on her feet as halflings often are, quickly ensnared the giant allowing us time to gather our forces.  Stinkymaw quickly healed Trees as my cousins and I let loose a volley of magic at the giant.   The battle with this gigantic mountain roamer was fierce and long, but after much mana had been spent the foul giant was finally struck dead.   <br><br>It was difficult to get back to sleep after such an intense melee, and luckily so.  No sooner had we gathered by our campfire than a fierce Yeti was spotted in the distance.   After a brief discussion, we decided to head out and slay this mighty beast.   As we hiked towards the clearing the snow beast stood in we were jumped, yet again, this time by a mythical cockatrice.   <br><br>After a fierce series of magical battles, we were able to destroy the cockatrice, the yeti, and another foul beast that resembled a black widow spider yet stood five feet in height.  The morning sun shown down on our tired band as we surveyed still more foul beasts roaming the land.  We decided to make a quick retreat closer to the tunnel to set up camp.  <br><br>A full day we camped there recovering our strength until we were well rested and, again, full of the adventurous spirit.   As we broke down our tents and prepared to move on, a weary ranger wandered into our camp.  Coraan of Finality had been missing and presumed dead after heading out to scout the new lands many weeks ago.  We were overjoyed to see him in our camp and bade him rest as we discussed his findings.  Many new lands he had been to and many new beasts had he slain on his travels.   Finally, weary from he constant battle, he had made his way back towards the outpost.  <br><br>As excited as I was to explore more of these new lands, I knew my duty as the high scholar of the Avatar.  I parted with my cousins and new friends and traveled with Coraan back to the elven outpost.  There, over a hot meal in the tavern, I began to take notes of his many adventures in the new lands.  <br><br>Thus comes the end of my tale, for now, Heroes.  It is now late in the night and I am still tired from my journeys.  I will send this letter in the next ship leaving for Butcherblock.   Please store it in our library until my return.   <br><br>Ezno Eyebiter<br>High Scholar of the Heroes of the Avatar,<br>Erudite Magician of the 39th circle.

Recently I have been hearing reports of deaths occuring among the populace of Norrath.  Not only do more and more deaths occur each day, but these are being accomplished in an extremely shoddy and amateurish fashion.<br><br>After over a year of effort, constantly polishing my style, I have come up with a point system that I believe may help improve the quality of deaths in Norrath.  The point system is primarily based on style, with higher scores indicating better performance.  It is my aim to edify the general populace and perhaps point out a few style enhancements that may prove worthwhile.<br><br>The point system starts out with a base of Zero (being the basic newbie death) and extends upwards.  It is not a fixed system, so particularly noteworthy style issues may be allotted extra points.  Remember to add or subtract all point scores that apply.<br><br>General (Any class)<br>Inches from zone line: +20<br>Massive train: +10<br>You were helping someone when massive train occurs behind you: +10<br>Trying to solo something completely impossible and (almost) succeeding: +30<br>Causing a massive train, which kills you along with others: -10/person<br>Causing massive train, but dying before the train gets anywhere (thus only YOU die) +10<br>Having your "Train to Zone! message interrupted by death: +10 points.<br>Having your second "Train to Zone! message interrupted, but getting first one out: +20<br>Getting lost while trying to zone: +5<br>Getting lost spectacularly (IE going in the opposite direction from zone): +15<br>Losing camo or invisibility while in an area populated by more than 3 mobs over 3 levels higher than you: +30<br>Smacking into a door that has just closed in front of you in a cartoonish fashion on the way to the zone: +40<br>Falling into Lava: +20<br>Falling into Lava while trying to retrieve the corpse you lost in the lava: +30<br>Falling into Lava while trying to retrieve another person's corpse lost in lava: +50<br>Falling into Lava because you didn't noticed the levitation Icon was blinking: +20<br>Bonus for original witty remark on the way down (Hot time in the old town tonight and other cliches do NOT count, while "Wheeeee!" may, depending on review of death): +40<br>Actually zoning, but dying immediately on the other side: +100<br>Any witty remark ("It's only a flesh wound!" may result in a penalty) just before death: +20<br>Everyone else in your area went LD when the BIG SPAWN occurs: +40 <br>...if you make a witty remark anyway, an additional: +10<br>...if anyone in your party gets back in time to hear it: +50<br>A heal gets off just as the LOADING, PLEASE WAIT message appears: +20<br><br>Healer Types:<br>You were tanking: -30<br>You weren't planning to tank: +20<br>You manage to get a heal off on yourself before dying: +10<br>You manage to get a heal off on someone else before dying: +30<br>The heal you got off is what caused you to die: +10<br>Everyone else survived: +10<br>Got bored and decided to pull: -40<br>(Druids only) Evaccing party and healing the member who's hitpoints suddenly plummet, not reaizing the druids and treeants around are responsible: +50<br>...if rest of party survives: +60<br><br>Caster types:<br>DoT'd self accidentally: -30<br>...if you manage to get an original witty remark off before you die: +10<br>...if the DoT kills you after you zone or the partie's safety is ensured: +30<br>Nuked Self: -20<br>...if you manage to get an original witty remark off before you die ("Oops!" or "D'oh!" may result in a penalty): +10<br>Repeated death due to binding badly: +20 per death<br>Lost level due to binding badly: +5 per level<br>Managing an original witty remark before dying: +30 per successful remark<br>...if each makes sense in relation to the others (ie Ack! <death> This <death> Really isn't<death>helping me<death> level<death>: +20 per completed phrase<br><br>Melee types (may include casters of any type who decide to melee)<br>Forgot to get buffs: -10<br>Tried to get buffs but failed (caster OOM or not available): +15<br>Manage to get a critical hit as you fall: +40<br>Getting trained while pulling: +20<br>Bringing full train to party while dying: -10 per member that dies<br>Bringing full train all the way to the zone, turning to fight, and suddenly realizing there are a LOT more than you started with: +30<br>Managing to bind wounds successfully before dying to the next train: +35<br>Breaking an enchanter's mez against their wishes: -30<br>...if the enchanter is really annoying and they get killed: +10 for each person who's game experience is thus enhanced.<br><br>Enchanting types:<br>Mezmerizing self: -20 points<br>...because someone dragged mob closer than they should have been: +30<br>Saving entire party only to be killed by all the mezzed mobs: +60<br>...if you manage an original witty remark about it: +20<br>...if you nearly make it to safety: +20<br><br>Leader types:<br>Killing new members within 5 minutes of being in guild: +20 per new member<br>...each additional death while recovering corpses: +10<br>...if the person is the bard tracking your corpse: +30<br>...bonus if it's a married couple: +5<br><br>Puller types:<br>getting lost on way back to group: +10<br>...starting huge train in the progress: +15<br>...eventually finding the group, bringing the train: +20<br>...bonus for killing every member of the party: +30<br><br>As you can see, this is still very much a work in progress.

Many do not understand this subtle art yet and seem to see each death as a bad thing, not the opportunity for improvement and character development that it really is.  My personal best score on this scale so far is 185.<br><br>So, print this list out, all, and start working on your form!

<P>
	In this essay I will discuss what I believe are the major pros and cons of the new Everquest Expansion, The Ruins of Kunark. This is all my own opinion, based on first-hand experience in exploring the new zones.<br><br>	On the 'PRO' side;<br><br>+ There are many new zones, 24 I think is the official number, so this helps greatly with the overcrowding I should think.<br><br>+ There is a new character race, the Iksar which gives the player a bit more variety to choose from when creating his character.<br><br>+ Perhaps hundreds of new monster types (only Verant knows the real number at this time but there are a lot).<br><br>+ Getting there. The trip to Kunark from the docks in Butcherblock Mountains is quite an experience, the large ship that the high elves have prepared is awe inspiring. ( It could be argued that the wood elves built it when you see the architecture and style) Also , this king of the sea is FAST! Someone must have 'disarmed' it back in the coding phase =P. The trip from Oasis is ..how can I say it..less outstanding. The main ship from the Timorous ogre island does have an evil theme though so it's worth it to see.<br><br>+ The new clouds look REALLY nice. I know this probably doesn't mean much, but seriously, turn on double sky layer for a minute and take a look, they did a nice job.<br><br>	On the 'CON' side;<br><br>- Problems before the expansion even came out. Yes I know everyone knows about this problem and is probably tired of hearing it, but it IS a problem. I don't know who's fault it was but there were/are some major delays in getting the CD's out to those who ordered them. By the time you read this there are probably some people who still have not recieved it yet.<br><br>- Zones. Some of them are too large for their own good. I know you're thinking, "What is this guy talking about? Too large? What a jerk, always trying to find something to complain about". Well I'll tell you this now, some zones ARE too big for their own good. Many travelers end up following the zone wall to get somewhere, as it is the easiest way not to get lost. This is sad because I'm sure the artists did a nice job on the stuff in the middle of the zones, but it will be a while before most people get the courage to go see it. The Dreadlands for example is approximately 3 or 4 times the size of West Karana, maybe more. Some zones, like The Lake of Ill Omen incorporate 2 or more ENTIRE dungeons within their boundaries ( not as separate branching zones) thereby reducing framerate considerably for players with even top of the line systems. For example, I myself am running a Pentium II 400mhz, 128megs RAM and a TnT2 Video Card. When I was inside the narrow twisting corridors of the ****** dungeon (dont want to spoil too much)  in the Lake of Ill Omen I was getting about 15 fps at 800x600 resolution, med particle density, medium clip plane, level of detail on, 3D sky double layer. Only when I went down to 640x480 resolution and turned off all those goodies did I get a semi smooth framerate. This is terrible considering that I can go through Butcherblock or West Karana with all those goodies on and get 30+ fps. I understand that they did increase the system requirements with the expansion but this is ridiculous. With a system that is somewhere near top of the line, to be forced to play in lowest resolution is an insult to my video card.<br><br>- The partial reason for these horrid framerates is the trees. Yes, the trees. I know its nice and realistic that the trees sway in the wind, but as soon as you get more than 6 or 8 trees on screen at once, be prepared for slowdown. This is even worse in the Warsliks Woods and the Burning Woods where there are trees EVERYWHERE as far as the eye can see. The leaf covered branches are low to the ground so you can't see 10 feet in front of you. While this is good because it creates a real sense of danger, it is too much when you have 15 trees all intersecting each other and all swaying, all around you. If they include a switch to turn off the swaying trees then I think this would help greatly. In fact let my put it in bold for those of you who are just skimping through. INCLUDE A SWITCH TO TURN OFF THE SWAYING OF THE TREES. Needles to say, navigating the woods is not desirable at 15 fps as there are countless moving objects obstructing your view.<br><br>- Several sound bugs. Many creatures emit male human sounds (even female creatures) when attacked. Although Verant has addressed this, it makes no sense why this was not taken care of before the release.<br><br>- Bad pathing in places like Karnor Castle (zone in the middle of Dreadlands). Creatures will run back and forth along an invisible line several times, not 5 feet away from where you stand before finally reaching you and attacking.<br><br>- Zone Lines not defined. There are several places where a player can walk around a lone line and fall though the world. (Tread carefully in The Burning Woods). I know this first-hand as I recently took a 10,000-damage plunge to my death. (Thanks to guide Dranyl The Night Watchman, Xegony for helping me). <br><br>	Now, I should say that not ALL zones are as bad as this at all times, some times if you are not looking around too much then you will be fine, but the majority of the zones that I have seen suffer from these problems. That being said, I'm not saying the new expansion is worthless, but it is not perfect, far from it I'm sad to say. Maybe Ill go back and look around again and try to get back into it. I did pay for this thing...<br><br>Byron Everglade, Xegony

<P>
Smashing the stereotype:  A brief insight in to the mind of an<br>established Player Killer.<br><br>Not all Player Killers fit in to the "kewl d00d" mold so readily<br>attached to them.  This brief essay is not an attempt to change your<br>gaming philosophy.  The following text is intended only to give you some<br>insight in to my own philosophy and perhaps to show that not all Player<br>Killers are the mindless children that most would have you believe them<br>to be.<br><br>Let me first introduce myself,  out of game context.  My name is Daymon<br>and I am a 26-year-old male residing in Vancouver, Canada.  I am<br>gainfully employed as a Project Manager responsible for the computer<br>business systems of a large forestry company.  I have had a computer<br>since 1982 and have been part of the online community since the first<br>300 BPS modem available for a Commodore 64.  I am by no means a social<br>deviant. I have many friends,  family and a girlfriend of nearly 2 years<br>now.  I sincerely love all of these people and would not trade them for<br>anything. I consider myself to be a stand up and trust worthy<br>individual.  I am fascinated with medieval times and many of my software<br>purchases reflect this.  <br><br>My experience with online gaming began with Diku MUDs many years ago.<br>From there I began playing West Coast Creation's Major MUD up until the<br>release of Ultima Online.  I continued to play Ultima Online on and off<br>until the release of EverQuest.  When EverQuest was released I<br>immediately canceled my UO account in favor of the newer,  flashier game<br>of the future!  I'd like to point out here that I never found Ultima<br>Online to be stable enough to provide a solid gaming experience.  Many<br>times after being disconnected I would log back in to find one or more<br>players standing around my ghostly image shouting something to the<br>effect of  "Stupid PK I owned you".   This more than any other one<br>factor made me leave Ultima Online. I have never played Quake and for<br>the most part have no interest in these first person shooter type games.<br><br><br>I have always been a PK,  in every game I have ever played.  I have<br>never played an "anti PK" or played by any other gaming philosophy.<br>Many of my "crimes against humanity",  mostly perpetrated in Ultima<br>Online, have been documented on the Internet (do a search for "WarChild<br>of KoT" if you are interested).  Most of these published experiences,<br>although resulting in the other player's death,  have been positive for<br>all parties involved.  <br><br>I am probably not what most would consider to be a "strong" Role Player.<br>I play for the challenge,  companionship and excitement of the game.<br>This is not to say that role-playing does not encompass these same<br>qualities. I do my very best to not impede others in their role-playing.<br>I do not try and change the way they wish to play the game and<br>appreciate being given the same consideration.  Online games are<br>different things to different people.  So long as one group is not<br>actively trying to stifle the gaming experience of another, I believe<br>there is room for co-existence.  The cooperation of all gaming groups is<br>however required for this and is easier said than done.<br><br>My Primary Character,  Chialde Tal'Dranneth of Rallos Zek is a level 44<br>Dark Elf Wizard.  She can be found quite often in the Karanas.  While<br>Wizard's are probably not the best choice for a PVP character,  I find<br>it suits my play style nicely.  The other two characters I play are<br>Chield Wardancer,  level 20 Ranger of Rallos Zek and Warchialde,  level<br>20 Shaman of Tallon Zek.  All of these characters have a reputation for<br>player killing.  All of these characters will always be Player Killers.<br><br>I have never been accused of exploiting.  I have never been banned or<br>suspended from ANY game.  I have never engaged in PVP for the sole<br>purpose of ruining somebody else's gaming experience.  I live by my own<br>code of conduct that includes,  but is not limited to,  the following<br>ideals:<br><br>* I do not hunt zone boundaries for my prey.  <br>* I will always let my target dispatch any MOB or NPC they may be<br>fighting before engaging them in PVP. <br>* I will accept almost any duel offered to me.<br>* I will not engage in a shouting match nor will I single out any<br>player, or group of players,  for having a different philosophy than my<br>own.  <br>* I will engage you in PVP when the opportunity arises.<br>* If you lose connection while fighting me,  and I notice,  I will<br>disengage combat immediately until you return (I returned a Rubicite<br>Breast Plate just the other day to a player whom I unknowingly killed<br>while he was link dead).<br>* I do not hunt naked.  In fact,  I wear many valuable and highly<br>desired items. <br>* I will not "pull the plug" in a zone to escape a death.  I will<br>try and wait out any victim who does this as I believe it is not in the<br>spirit of the game.  Zone boundaries are part of the game's mechanics,<br>not a "home free" area to run to.  <br>* I will not corpse or bind camp. <br>* I will not bind rush. If I am defeated,  I will retrieve my<br>corpse and leave.  After all,  to the victor go the spoils!  <br>* I do not care if I get any "loot" from a victim.  EverQuest,  to<br>me,  is not about accumulating the most items possible.  Quite often I<br>will sell back any item I take from somebody at a price far below the<br>item's market value. <br>* I will keep my word, once given.<br>* I will endeavor to play fairly at all times.<br>* I have never nor will ever utter the phrase "I owned j00!"<br>* I will treat everybody with the same basic level of respect<br>deserving to all human beings.  Treat me badly and I'll simply ignore<br>you.<br><br>Without re-hashing and old,  tired argument,  I will simply state that<br>in my opinion Player Killing IS a component of PVP.  Anybody who plays<br>on the PVP servers should expect this type of activity to occur.  If a<br>player wants a controlled PVP environment,  there are some 20 odd other<br>servers that cater to this.  You can duel,  chose to activate your PVP<br>switch or fight in an arena on any of the essentially non-PVP based<br>servers.  By playing on Rallos,  Tallon or Vallon Zek,  you are in<br>effect consenting to be involved in unscheduled,  unregulated player vs.<br>player activity.  I very much dislike somebody joining this environment<br>to attempt and change it.  In it's most simple form:  I do not come to<br>Non-PVP servers attempting to make them PVP servers.  Please do not come<br>to my PVP server and attempt to make it anything other than what it is.<br><br>In closing,  I would like to re-iterate that this is not intended to<br>sway anybody's gaming philosophy.  This is not an attempt to justify my<br>actions to myself or anybody else.  I don't feel I need to.  I do not<br>consider myself to be a "kewl d00d",   "power gamer"or exploiter.  The<br>next time somebody takes your life in EverQuest,  before you shout out<br>"stupid power gaming kewl d00d pk!" or spam them with tells of how much<br>they suck and how dead you will make them,  ask yourself this;  "Does<br>this person really fit the stereotype I am attaching them to?".  You<br>might find some people out there that surprises you.  I know I<br>constantly do.<br><br>Please feel free to contact me in game on any of my characters.  I will<br>be pleased to have an intelligent discussion with you on a whole host of<br>interesting topics!  <br><br>Chialde Tal'Dranneth - Officer of Darkenbane,  Player Killer and intelligent human being

<P>
Most of us living within Norrath have known for a LONG time that<br>the /con system is messed up and heavily favors casters. After thinking<br>long and hard about it (and getting madder every time I log on); and<br>after hearing Verant's latest explanation of how it is "supposed" to<br>work, I have come up with the following idea regarding the /con system<br>and it's future.<br><br>First, a little background on the /con system. According to the game<br>manual when EverQuest first opened up to the public and for the last<br>year of our lives, we have been told the following statistics applied to<br>the /con system:<br><br>Green: You should be able to kill it easy. So easy in fact, you get NO<br>experience when you kill it except in rare HIGH GREEN cases.<br><br>Blue: You should be able to kill it if you are full health and mana<br>and though you will take damage, odds are you will emerge the victor<br>easily.<br><br>White: A fair fight. It could go either way, depending on your stats and<br>the mood of the gods at that moment<br><br>Yellow: You, on your own, should NOT be able to kill this NPC, except in<br>rare circumstances, adn if you do, you will be VERY low on HP and<br>probably NO mana left.<br><br>RED: YOU will NOT be able to kill this on your own. In fact, in most<br>cases you are going to die very fast.<br><br>Within each class above there are "low" and "high" cons that affect<br>the class a little. For instance you will be able to kill a "low" blue<br>/con easier than a "high" blue /con.<br><br>The only problem without the /con system above is that it simply does not work<br>at levels above 15 or so....sometimes lower, if you are a melee<br>or (in some cases) a hybrid class. If you have played the game for more<br>than 12 or 13 levels, you begin to notice that the "Blue" /cons can and<br>probably will kick yer butt and "White /cons are almost certain death.<br>However, pure casters and druids have little trouble soloing "White" and<br>even "Yellow" cons all the way up the Level slider.<br>Before I go any further, let me tell you that I play both a Level<br>24 Wizard and a Level 24 Warrior.....exact OPPOSITES in the class range.<br>Both of these characters are VERY well outfitted for their levels, both<br>are maxed out in their skills for the level, and both have VERY good<br>stats. Both characters fight in Mistmoore, mainly in the courtyard. My<br>wizard can SOLO the mob's there all day long, however there is NO WAY my<br>warrior can survive the courtyard solo for any period of time....he<br>simply cannot take the damage. The problem with this is that the mobs<br>there /con THE SAME to both of my characters.<br>Let me say also that I know that casters are designed to be more<br>powerful to some degree than straight melee because of their spells. I<br>HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT. My problem is that the /con system is SOLELY<br>based on level.<br><br>Verant has come out in the past few weeks and tried to further<br>define how the /con system works. It is a pitiful attempt to gloss over<br>what so many melee players have been griping about for so long.<br>According to Verant, the /con system, AS YOU GET HIGHER in level,<br>(supposedly) assumes that you are GROUPED and that the /con you are<br>seeing is meant to reflect it being attacked by a GROUP. Hogwash.<br>Lets take their assumption that the /con reflects a group. The blue<br>initiate familair that /cons low to high blue to my warrior means that<br>my warrior is going to need a group to take it out. It usually does<br>require more than 1 melee person attacking it to kill it effectively.<br>Now, assuming I have 4 people in my party, we have to split a low to<br>high blue con experience 4 ways. That is a lot of killing to level up.<br>However, THAT SAME initiate familair that requires 4 melee class people<br>to kill it effectively, can be DESTROYED EASILY by my level 24<br>Wizzie.....with NO damage done to him. So now, my Wizzie gets the FULL<br>experience value for the kill because he soloed it. My wizzie is going<br>to level A LOT faster than my warrior is, which in fact, he does. Is<br>there any wonder there are so many casters in the realm as compared to<br>melee or hybrid classes? No, it is easy to see that the game caters to<br>the casters.<br><br>Now for my solution to fix the con system? Simple. If a mob<br>/conning blue to a melee class at certain level (say 24, for example)<br>requires several melee class people to kill it effectively, then that<br>same NPC should /con GREEN to the same level caster. Or to reverse the<br>case, a "high" blue /con to a solo caster should /con White or even<br>"low" yellow to the same level melee classes. This would balance out<br>more evenly the experience gained by all in the game. It simply makes NO<br>SENSE why my caster can SOLO yellow /cons while my Warrior gets his<br>brains beaten in by a "high" blue /con. Even if the crap Verant is<br>feeding us is correct about the /con reflecting a group con, then<br>explain WHY my caster is STILL able to solo it.<br><br>Seeing how the /con system is based solely on level, it would seem<br>to me to be easy to implement my suggestion. Simply correct the<br>databases on the NPC's to reflect 1 to 2 levels higher on the /con scale<br>to melee and most hybrid classes (Druids seem to be a hybrid class that<br>can solo practically as good as casters). That way, experience will be<br>more equally shared by all, seeing as that you RARELY find 20+ melee<br>characters soloing, but it is quite a COMMON site to see level 20+<br>Caster characters soloing. Now, you ask, "What if the caster is in a<br>group of melee classes and they NPC is blue to the caster and white to<br>the melee classes? Won't the caster take less experience than the melee<br>guys for the same kill?" Yes, but that could be worked out as well, like<br>taking for instance the AVERAGE level of the group and awarding the<br>experience accordingly. It would have to be worked on yes, but it could<br>be done.<br><br>Finally, for all who would flame me for this opinion, I understand<br>BOTH sides here, Casters wanting the power and Melee classes upset by<br>the /con system because I PLAY both types. However, I understand that<br>there is a problem and would have no qualms about having this happen. I<br>would still be able to solo NPC's with my Caster, but my Warrior, who,<br>having to group to effectively kill the same mob, would get his<br>experience upped to reflect the fact that the NPC is harder to kill by<br>melee classes.<br><br>I have talked to MANY people in game about the /con system and most<br>agree that something should be done. Not surprisingly the majority of<br>people who seem to like the /con system the way it is happens to be<br>either a Druid or a PURE Caster. Hmmmmmmm, I wonder why that is :)<br><br>Jaxsion KneeCrusher<br>24th Season Servant of Rallos ZEK<br>Warrior Champion of Rivervale<br>Dragonfire Guild<br>Veeshan

<P>
Greetings fellow players and ex-players alike.  Today, I wish to speak on the subject of what EverQuest has become, the adulterated form of what the original principle was.  <br><br>	To begin with, EverQuest is meant to be the graphical representation of a fantasy setting, putting images to life where previously, imagination had to be employed.  The idea behind it was a fantasy setting, a role-playing environment, where the real world would be kept to a minimum, and to the respective channels if at all possible. It caters most to those who wish to enjoy the game, and less to those who seeks the instant thrill. If I am wrong about this, then you need read no further.<br><br>	My personal experience extends back only to the 4th phase of the Beta testing.  At that time, there was that certain mystique about it which allowed every new monster, each turn of the corner a new and unexpected thrill which all novices experience (or at least I hope so.) This is nothing new, this is simply the thrill of discovery, but even then, it still seemed in-character, it still seemed as a fantasy.<br><br>	Growing up, however, one <u>must</u> abandon some aspects of role-playing in order to succeed, lest that player never accomplish anything.  What I mean is the people shouting for "Can I get a SOW please?" or perhaps auctioning "WTB: SMR, GBS, and GEB." To understand anything of what goes on in the world, that player must abandon their ignorance.<br><br>	Normally most people consider the banishment of ignorance, of any form, a good thing.  But consider it this way: to take the first steps in learning, one also learns more about the game as it is outside of a role-playing environment.  Now, I'm not so naive as to think that there will never be people around who never break someone's fantasy, nor will everyone respect each other enough to see a role-player and avoid ooc around him/her.  I do, however, believe that there is no other way to progress in EverQuest, neither by levels nor social standing, unless one takes an active part in dismantling the mechanics of how the game works, so that the maximum effect can be wrought.  This inevitably has the effect of reducing a person's fun, which, according to Verant, is the driving factor behind Customer Service: if the majority of customers aren't happy, then something is wrong.<br><br>	As a character matures, the player behind it learns more and more of the world, creating mental maps of the areas, and with this, spawn areas, drops, roamer pathing, and all the other technical information needed to hunt there. There is something very wrong about knowing everything about a zone, knowing every major spawn, the major items contained within, the levels to hunt there.  There is no more factor of the unexpected. There is nothing that Verant can do to help this, and once they realize this inherant flaw, they <i>might</i> be able to work alongside players in a conscious effort to extend EverQuest's lifespan. Until then, they must employ Internet-Relations specialists such as once-Guide Gordon Wrinn to find out what the vocal minority wants in the game, constantly changing the way external mechanics work in an effort to promote "balance" through second or third-hand experience, rather than the designers and development team seeing and experiencing the problems for themselves.<br><br>	Take for instance, the Alter Planes.  In the Planes of Fear and Hate, a tactic known as "breaking" must be used before the plane can be "done," meaning that effective team tactics must be used if that group plans to continue hunting there.  Reasonable enough.  Now take the information that to break the plane, a large majority of the hunting party needs to know the mechanics of the game: pathing problems, damage percentages, agro status, etc.  In fact, this is true among most every place where there is a constant spawn, Unrest, Kedge, both Upper and Lower Guk, Solusek's Eye, and the other dungeons.  This is the corruption of which I speak.  Why should a player be required to know external game calculations when the setting is supposedly in-character? To ruin someone's fantasy with numbers and spawn information is the failure of what I and others originally played EverQuest for.  We wanted to be able to get away from the "real world" and have fun in this fantasy realm.  Now the question is no longer "By Marr...what powers does that nefarious sight hold that it can slay our friends with but a gesture?" but "Omg, how the hell did Sirren just wipe the entire zone pop in less than 2 seconds??" <br><br>	There are some exceptions, but not many.  The Plane of the Sky has not been fully "done" yet, as the monsters it contains are meant for post-expansion players.  When a higher level island has been breached, it is heralded as a great triumph, but I fear that this is the last of its kind.  Even with the impending lands of Kunark about to provide new areas and opportunities, there will no longer be the awed hush as a new monster which is not aggressive walks by, but rather the question to the group, "Got mana for one more?"

Recently I began to ask myself a question. What in the world could make sensible <br>people turn into swearing, babbling, blabbering fools, frothing at the mouth at the drop of <br>a hat. What could possibly ignite the fires of hate in a person so strongly that they post <br>whole newsgroup messages consisting of "F*** YOU VERANT!" After thinking on it <br>for several moments (it honestly didn't take long), I came up with one answer: <br>EverQuest.<br><br>I started playing EverQuest over a year ago, just weeks after it hit the store <br>shelves. At first, no one was this passionate about the game. It was still a game. Unknown <br>to all of us of course was The Addiction&#8482; (this is much like The Vision&#8482;, but is not <br>advertised by Verant). The Addiction&#8482; is blind, much like justice and can afflict anyone <br>who dares put the EverQuest CD in his or her CD-Rom drive. As the title of my article <br>states, I find this Addiction&#8482; to be akin to a religion. The Addiction&#8482; can drive a person <br>into a religious furor if the Addiction&#8482; is not fed.<br><br>Now, I will be the first to admit I have been caught up in the furor myself. <br>Unfortunately for me, I am usually in the defense of Verant (because I feel they have <br>made an excellent product). I always wondered to myself after the matter had blown over, <br>how I could get caught up in the same boiling anger as hundreds of other players. I have <br>always considered myself a reasonable person, intelligent, fair and never quick to jump to <br>conclusions. It seems though that when EverQuest is the topic, my mind goes into a state <br>of panic and all the rationale I have is blown out the window. It is my personal belief that <br>this is the case with over 90% of the "trolls" and "flamers" on the message boards. <br>Behind that keyboard they are a rational, intelligent person who has gone into a fit of <br>anger over an Addiction&#8482;, just like a zealot would over his or her religion.<br><br>I sometimes wonder how a game could inspire this kind of passion in people. I <br>mean, in reality what is EverQuest? A series of binary strings interpreted by your <br>computer to put a nice 3D rendered picture on your screen. It is simply streams of data, <br>nothing more, nothing less. How can intangible streams of data make peoples stomachs <br>churn and their hearts boil to the brim with hate and anger? Simple: Immersion. People <br>get completely immersed in EverQuest and the world of Norrath. The people, the sites, <br>the sounds, the interaction. No matter what you think of Verant or EverQuest you have to <br>admit it is one of the most immersive worlds ever created. It simply draws you in and <br>won't let you go. To illustrate what I mean. Last Saturday I sat down in front of my <br>computer with the intention of playing for two hours then going outside for some fresh <br>air. I logged in as Brambel, summoned some food and headed to Lake Rathetear for some <br>hunting. When I looked up at the clock over eleven hours had passed. I had lost all track <br>of time, it was now dark outside, my stomach was rumbling. I had not eaten, taken a <br>drink or so much as moved from that chair in eleven hours. Some may laugh and call me <br>a junkie, but I know some of you reading this have done the exact same thing.<br>	<br>With the Ruins of Kunark opening up in about three days, we have to ask <br>ourselves: What impact is this game having on my life? How is it affecting me, especially <br>if the affect is adverse? I for one have begun to scare myself with the amount of time I <br>spend in Norrath. I live two separate lives. I get up and go to work everyday, earning my <br>pay, doing my job and putting food on my table. When I go home, I live a separate life. I <br>am a halfling Druid named Brambel  Thistletoe, not a software developer named <br>Matthew. Even as much as the extent of my Addiction&#8482; scares me, I have no intention <br>of cutting back on my play. Perhaps I should, perhaps I should question why I let this <br>game rule parts of my life. Perhaps we all should?<br><br>Brambel Thistletoe

I read with interest the editorial you posted entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid956081020,81624,">EverQuest Ettiquite and Unwritten Rules</a>&#8221; written by Ungoliant SpiderSoul. I read this with interest, mostly because I feel that there certainly is a lack of common courtesy among players in EQ lately. Unfortunately, it is &#8220;common&#8221; courtesy most in that it should be innate among players, not because it exists in abundance. To a lesser extent, I was interested due to the fact that I also play on the Karana server. This server is extremely overcrowded, and when operating in such close quarters it becomes so much more important to show each other the respect that they deserve.<br><br>The article, in and of itself, is inaccurately titled. It should have been titled &#8220;A powergamer&#8217;s perspective on farming items efficiently - and the arguments you need to use to justify your actions&#8221;. For the most part, these &#8220;unwritten rules&#8221; are simply justifications to keep other players from what you feel is yours. I will address one of these specifically.<br><br>&#8220;* If a player or group is at a small spawn or camp, and has obviously been <br>there a while, it is an unwritten rule that they own that spawn. They most <br>likely have spent enourmous efforts (and possibly lives) to set the spawn at <br>the camp, and they deserve to keep it. One may think that they have a fair <br>share there too, but this is not the case. You put no effort in helping <br>split or set the spawn, why should you reap the benefits? Any high level <br>player can tell you this&#8221;<br><br>This is inaccurate. You may feel this is an &#8220;unwritten rule&#8221;, but in actuality, the <b>written rule</b> is that you do not &#8220;own the spawn&#8221;. Any other player has as much right to the spawns in Norrath as you do. Note that this does <b>not</b> necessarily mean that you must yield and allow them to take it immediately. Something as simple as stating that you will advise them when you are vacating within a reasonable amount of time is all that is usually necessary. By your &#8220;unwritten rule&#8221; a large guild could hold popular spawns such as the &#8220;Golden Effreeti Boots&#8221; in Solusek B, or the Yakesha in Lower Guk, for weeks. The result of this kind of attitude is that by controlling the supply of such popular items, the prices would rise exponentially, and people who have a right to such items (and are an appropriate level) are unable to attain them. This is simply unfair. Also, the statement that they put no effort in splitting the spawn equates to no right to benefits is inaccurate. You are excluding them from the spawn, thereby not allowing them to put effort into controlling it. The argument is circular, and excludes people from enjoyment of the game. Most people who play EverQuest <b>want</b> to put <b>lots</b> of effort into acquiring items for their characters. That is what makes the game fun. People who want to sit at a camp and supply the items to lower level guild members (i.e. - power gaming guilds) or their own low level characters (twinks) are trying to sidestep this effort.<br><br>His other &#8220;unwritten rules&#8221; follow from a similar flawed logic, that the right of an individual is more than the rights of the Norrath Society as a whole. It is a question of balance. People need to be respectful of those among them in Norrath. The document written by Ungoliant is a recipe of disrespect and self-importance.<br><br>I offer the following alternate set of &#8220;unwritten rules of Norrath&#8221;. They are short, simple, and easy to remember. Like everything that is really &#8220;common sense&#8221; they are general and applicable to many situations. Unlike the previous set, they are written to allow people unfamiliar with the game to integrate within Norrath and enjoy the experience in utmost.<UL>1.	When dealing with another player, always remember that although you may be interacting in an RP way with another &#8220;person&#8221; in Norrath, there is a real human being with real human feelings behind them. You probably do not know this person, but treat them as though you do. If they ask for something that is unreasonable, explain why (i.e. - out of mana, can&#8217;t afford it, in a hurry). If they ask for help, try to aid them. Yes, some of us have been playing this game for over a year now, many haven&#8217;t, and the world of Norrath is a confusing place.<br><br>2.	Share share share. If you have room in your group, and someone wants to join and is an appropriate level, let them. If you are full, tell them you&#8217;ll let them know when there is room. If you are afraid of &#8220;xp dilution&#8221; you are probably overpowered enough anyway, and another person will not significantly downgrade your experience further.<br><br>3.	Remember that Everquest is a &#8220;Multiplayer&#8221; game and that you are in a simulated society. I found that many of the attitudes presented in the previous document place the person believing these unwritten rules in a position where they feel superior to their fellow players. You are no more or less important than anyone else. If you want to play a game where you do not have to interact with other people, play a single player game for a bit. If you find yourself annoyed with forced interaction with others perhaps Everquest isn&#8217;t the best game for you. Power gamers have as much right to the spoils of Norrath as anyone else, but they do not have any more.<br><br>4.	If you attempt to interact with someone who is rude or unhelpful, simply move on. Realize that you are gaining much more than they are from the game, that the game is not about madly leveling, it is about having a good time.</UL>If you try to remember these simple rules at all times while you move throughout Norrath, you will find your experience significantly more enjoyable.<br><br>Serenedena Caamora<br>50th Shaman<br>Officer of The Silver Blades<br>Karana Server

<P>
Recently, I have started a new character and have come across a disturbing <br>trend amongst new players - They have no respect for unwritten rules. It <br>could be because no one has ever explained them, but nevertheless I feel it <br>is my duty to try to explain them: <br><br>* If a player in anonymous, they most likely have good reason. They do not <br>want to be bothered! Do not hound them for "buffs" or "TPs".<br><br>* When searching for a specific service, it is common curtesy for a player <br>to not /shout aimlessly for "need SOW plz" or "Can someone TP me to NK <br>plzez?". It only takes a few seconds to do a /who search for a player with a <br>specific service. Most people will be more than happy to grant a service if <br>you are more personal. Most people will NOT answer a random /shout.<br><br>* If a player or group is at a small spawn or camp, and has obviously been <br>there a while, it is an unwritten rule that they own that spawn. They most <br>likely have spent enourmous efforts (and possibly lives) to set the spawn at <br>the camp, and they deserve to keep it. One may think that they have a fair <br>share there too, but this is not the case. You put no effort in helping <br>split or set the spawn, why should you reap the benefits? Any high level <br>player can tell you this.<br><br>* It is good practice to read what is /auction'ed or /ooc'ed. It is just <br>troublesome (and downright rude and annoying) to ask "How much?" for <br>something that was clearly stated as being bought. The same holds for /ooc <br>or /shout conversations. If you don't know what you are talking about, don't <br>say anything. Doing so only makes you look bad.<br><br>* If you feel that your class/race/diety/position/faction standing/etc. is <br>not as good as anothers, and you don't like it, do not complain. You chose <br>the position you are/were in, deal with it. If you do not like it, choose <br>another. Whining and complaining only hurts, it doesn't help. If you feel <br>that a class is "better than yours", why are you complaining? Their <br>advantages will help you.<br><br>* The above statement holds true for twinks, too. If a person has better <br>equipment than you, what gives you the right to complain? Most likely they <br>have a higher level character who earned it. Others might have gotten lucky. <br>A twinked player is only a benefit, being able to cast more efficently, take <br>more hits, etc. A self-twinked player most likely knows a lot more tactics <br>than a non-twinked player of the same level, and can put them to use by <br>making a fight go more efficently. More efficent fights = less death and <br>more experience.<br><br>* If a player doesn't want to group, he doesn't want to group! Some players <br>function well solo, others are antisocial and do not like to group. Still <br>others just want some time alone. If they say no, don't complain...just find <br>somebody else.<br><br>* And finally, and most importantly, LIFE ISN'T FAIR! If you think something <br>shouldn't be that way, don't complain, just suck it up, deal with it, and <br>adapt. Complainers cause more problems than solutions, and when a person's <br>abilities are nerfed, who do you think they are going to be mad at? <br>(Exception: If there is harrassment or another extreme case, you shouldn't <br>have to take it.)<br><br>Maybe this seems a little harsh, but people must learn the proverbial ropes <br>=). Thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon.<br><br>Ungoliant SpiderSoul<br>Karana Server

The EQ Staff has not elaborated on the "studies" that have led them to<br>believe that the majority of the players that now play EQ PVP would not go<br>for a PVP XP loss system (contrary to the Risk Poll, posted on the EQ-PvP<br>forum). However, they did open the door for a poll, and if they actually<br>need this information to make a decision, I would like to suggest a way to<br>do a poll ONLY on the PVP servers.<br><br>Insert the poll question only on the PVP servers, AFTER the server selection<br>screen, but before the character enters the world. That way, one would<br>actually have to log onto a PVP server, or have a character on one of the<br>PVP servers, to respond to the poll. Of course, one could create a character<br>on a PVP server just for the purpose of participating in the poll, but at<br>least that person would have some interest in PVP to be willing to do that. <br>The results of this poll would not only show what the majority of PVP<br>players prefer, but would show which servers currently prefer which methods.<br>Then decide to change all servers to the same system, or implement different<br>systems on different servers, depending on the outcome of the poll, and<br>allow character transfers.<br><br>The EQ Staffer (Gordon) mentioned in another post that they felt that xp<br>loss is the best system for EQ PVP. I agree. EQ's game mechanics are already<br>engineered almost exclusively around xp gain/loss. Why should PVP be any<br>different? I have faith in Verants "vision" of EQ, and feel that if EQ<br>believes that xp loss/gain in EQ PVP is the superior system, then EQ should<br>implement their vision of PVP, and not necessarily what the players may feel<br>is most popular.<br><br>I have had many conversations with people regarding the pros and cons of EQ<br>PVP. IF I can get the person to disregard what they have grown accustomed to<br>regarding the current system(s), they usually see the benefits and<br>superiority of an XP based system. I usually argue that xp loss should be a<br>fraction (25%) of the amount lost to an NPC, because the likelihood of being<br>defeated by a PC is much greater than being defeated by an NPC. <br>Most people on PVP servers play casters. This is fact. Many PVP casters have<br>grown accustomed to not wearing their prized gear most of the time (if<br>anything at all), and only wearing what they are comfortable losing when<br>there is even a remote risk of a PVP confrontation. These people have for the<br>most part eliminated risk from themselves, and thus the thought of losing xp<br>to a PK is unsettling. They are accustomed to shouldering little or no risk.<br>It SHOULD NOT be possible to eliminate all risk from yourself in a PVP<br>environment. Many casters' vision of risk is someone else risk, not theirs.<br>Melee's don't have this luxury, and don't know the feeling of never being at<br>risk. However, most meleer's DO know the feeling of risking to those who<br>don't risk anything, and I can say from first hand experience that I DONT<br>LIKE IT! It needs to change. Visit any major PvP confrontation on Valon<br>Zek, and what you see is 99% Naked combatants (or no drop, or inferior<br>equip) participating in battles. It's not a "healthy" PvP environment at<br>all. Naked PvP, combined with Power Bagging pretty much summarize the<br>typical battle.<br><br>Coin only eliminates the majority of the risk from most people, but still<br>allows people to eliminate ALL risk from themselves (What they've implemented<br>on Talon Zek). It is still a flawed system, but marginally superior to item<br>loot. If a server switch occurs, I will leave VZ. But not because I'm<br>endorsing ZERO RISK, but because Item Loot is grossly inherently flawed as<br>it has been implemented on Valon and Ralos Zek.<br><br>It will be very hard to implement an XP based PVP system, considering that<br>for almost a year now many people have been able to play with very minimal risk<br>to themselves. Many have profited greatly from the current system, and have<br>lost very little. Some, particularly those that are used to being able to<br>take without risking, will have a hard time adjusting to being at risk. On<br>the other hand, players that have played "straight up", "non naked" will<br>rejoice at the change. In the long run the PVP servers will be much<br>healthier with an XP based system. <br><br>EQ doesn't really need the information garnered from a poll, nor do they<br>need to go with the system they "feel" to be the most popular. XP gain/loss<br>is the system preferred by EQ Staffer with the power to make a change<br>(Gordon) and is the system that provides equitable fair risk for all and<br>that's issue that should be paramount in pvp game designers minds. Please,<br>relieve us all of the "Naked, No Risk Item Ganking World" we pvp'er endure<br>now, and replace it with one of Equitable Risk and Fairness.<br><br>Brega, 41 Troll SK of Vallon Zek

I am a member of a respectable guild on the Brell Server called Order of Kynigos. My name is Negas or at least used to be. I have never had to deal with a GM or guide before, so this situation both infuriates and confuses me.<br> <br>I was at the wedding of two of our guild members on Saturday 4-16 and during the reception a Senior Guide, Sinanie, asked to talk to me. She said that my name, Negas, was in violation of Verant's naming rules and that I had to change it. She said it was a commonly known name from Star Trek. Now, I don't really care for Star Trek, but I have a guild mate and my best friend are Star Trekie's. My best friend said that the closest reference to Negas in Star Trek was "The Grand Nagus Zek" in less than 10 episodes of Star Trek DS9.<br> <br>First my name isn't the same as "The Grand Nagus Zek" and secondly "The Grand Nagus" part of his name is a title not a name. It's kinda like "President of the United States Bill Clinton". She said it was too close to the spelling of Nagus and she gave me the name Nesg. I have attempted to escalate this wrongful doing with little to no success.<br> <br>The reason I am writing is because it doesn't appear that I will get my name back and that such a vague reference to another genre was picked out of all the ridiculous names that are in the game already (You know who you are). Even you players who thought that you picked a great fantasy role-playing name better watch out. I am sure that Verant could find your name in some other genre, book, movie, TV show, or something or at least a vague variation of your name.<br> <br>So watch out, you could be next!<br> <br>P.S. I just realized that the supposedly well known name Zek from Star Trek's "The Grand Nagus Zek" is used in three of Verant's servers, Rallos Zek, Tallos Zek, and Vallos Zek. Does Verant's policy that they imposed on me mean that they are going to change their server names?<br><br><CENTER><b>Discuss this issue on a special <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?mes=5450634">Player View Board Thread</a></b></CENTER>

<P>
The warm breeze blowing through the Commonlands gave no comfort to Khonshu as he stood watch over the empty Orc camp with his companions. A great peril was at hand & Quellious gave no clue as to the hour that it would arrive. At the urging of Puab Klosk, Grandmaster of the Ashen Order, Khonshu accompanied his friends Pandawen & Halyn, a paladin & cleric respectively & representatives of the Temple of Mithaniel Marr, Sian, a Half-Elvish paladin of Pandawen&#8217;s faith, and Eirik, a Wood Elf ranger acquaintance, to the edges of the Commonlands near Kithicor. From Puab&#8217;s rather disturbed tone, the matter was grave indeed. <br><br>&#8220;Pandawen,&#8221; Khonshu said, &#8220;You&#8217;ve been uncharacteristically tight-lipped throughout this watch. What exactly are we looking out for?&#8221; <br><br>Pandawen smiled. &#8220;No fooling you, my friend. I suppose I&#8217;d better fill you in on why we&#8217;re out her on our little surveillance mission. Three days ago, a caravan bound for Freeport came under attack by a rather heavily armed band of orcs. The merchants & other members of the caravan were slaughtered to the last soul.&#8220; <br><br>&#8220;What makes the matter more frightening,&#8221; Halyn added, &#8221;is that we found this amongst the bodies at the site.&#8221; Halyn reached into her backpack, produced a morning star & handed it to the ranger. &#8220;What say you to that, Eirik?&#8221; <br><br>Eirik studied the weapon & a look of astonishment slowly crept over his face. &#8220;Clearly, this is a weapon of orcish design, but it bears the markings of the clan Crushbone..&#8221; <br><br>The cloud of dread slowly spread to the further reaches of Khonshu&#8217;s heart. &#8220;Are you telling me that there is a possibility that the Deathfist & the Crushbone are forming an alliance?&#8221; <br><br>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; Sian spat out. &#8220;Are you afraid to face them? I&#8217;ve heard that the fists of the Ashen are sturdier than their resolve! You pacifists are no better than the godless Silent Fist&#8230; &#8221; <br><br>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make the mistake of confusing calm with a lack of courage, Sian!&#8221; Pandawen shouted, visibly angered by the enflaming remarks of his fellow paladin. &#8220;I&#8217;ve fought alongside Khonshu in many campaigns against the Deathfist & other enemies of Marr. His grasp of his art meets or exceeds any warrior&#8217;s sword arm. Best not to insult concepts you don&#8217;t understand. To insult the Ashen is to relinquish this mortal coil.&#8221; <br><br>&#8220;That&#8217;s quite enough, my friend,&#8221; Khonshu calmly replied. &#8220;Sian is entitled to his opinion. Should the time for a skirmish arrive, I will prove my prowess. Hopefully to his satisfaction.&#8221; Halyn beamed a smile at her friend, but took a rather icy tone as she turned to face Sian. <br><br>&#8220;At any rate, we don&#8217;t need any dissention in our ranks. We&#8217;ll have enough problems if we&#8217;re forced to fight. The Deathfist & Crushbone tribes hate each other almost as much as they do every other race. Anything that unifies them is a powerful force to be reckoned with.&#8221; <br><br>Day gave way to nightfall & their vigilance was rewarded. <br><br>After what seemed to be an eternity, Eirik noticed torchlight in the valley. The Deathfist were returning from another raid. The camp suddenly filled with the shouts of war cries & screams of victory. Pandawen quickly assessed the situation & formulated a strategy. <br><br>&#8220;We aren&#8217;t here to start a fight, merely gather information. Khonshu, you & Eirik are best suited for a clandestine entry of the camp. Find out what you can. If there is any trouble, we shall provide support.&#8221; <br><br>Eirik smiled. &#8220;Seems fair enough, although I think that we could handle that lot. I only count seven in that war party.&#8221; Like ghosts, the monk & the ranger melted into the dimly lit landscape. <br><br>Khonshu crept closer to the tents on the outskirts of the camp, being careful to avoid being noticed. Below the shouts of the orcs, the monks heard a rather intense exchange of words whispering on the wind. He slowly made his way to one of the larger tents & cut a small eyehole in the fabric with the edge of one of his wolf-stars. There in the tent sat what appeared to be a Deathfist legionnaire conversing in a rather heated tone with another blue-skinned orc. &#8220;Crushbone,&#8221; Khonshu thought to himself & silently thanked Quellious that he decided to pay attention during Ran&#8217;un&#8217;s tutorials on the Orcish language. <br><br>&#8220;Bah!! They may be your masters, Barak Sol, but they are not my own. While Shin Ree is appreciative of the weapons, that doesn&#8217;t mean that we accept their rule. Our offer still stands; safe passage for the Crushbone to Antonica after Freeport falls to the Deathfist in exchange for further weapons shipments.&#8221; <br><br>&#8220;How dare you say that they are our masters! They are merely benefactors with a vested interest in an entrenched Crushbone presence in this region. The Deathfist can either benefit from it or be victims of it!&#8221; <br><br>Khonshu heard the faint crackle of magical energy. Someone was coming to pay the duo a visit. As Khonshu strained to make out the figures, he heard cries of alarm from the outskirts of the camp. Much to his chagrin, he saw his companion, Sian, engaging the advanced guards with Pandawen & Halyn in tow.<br>It was obvious that Sian had taken it upon himself to attack the orcs & settle matters directly. <br><br>&#8220;Reckless Half-Elf,&#8221; the monk muttered to himself. The war cries brought the two orcs from the tent to aid their fellows against the advancing warriors. As Khonshu emerged from the shadows, he heard the familiar hiss of sheaf arrows hurtling through the air. Eirik would support the others while he confronted Barak Sol. <br><br>&#8220;Barak Sol of the Crushbone. I, Khonshu of the Ashen, would ask you to surrender. There is little sense in one of us dying this day.&#8221; The orc snarled, relishing the thought of spilling the young monk&#8217;s blood. <br><br>&#8220;Ashen, eh? I&#8217;ve killed many of your kind, human. The Shadow Wolf won&#8217;t save you from my axe!&#8221; <br><br>Barak Sol lashed out suddenly; his battle-axe cleaving the air dangerously close to Khonshu. The monk shouted & unleashed a swift, staggering blow. If Barak hadn&#8217;t known better, he&#8217;d have sworn that the monk&#8217;s hands were made of iron. The orc spat out a tooth in disgust & pressed his attack. Despite the furious exchange of strikes & feints, the two warriors were locked in an evenly matched battle of skill and ferocity. Around them rung the chime of steel on steel and the cries of the dying orcs. Seizing an advantage, the monk spun & lashed out with a savage kick; staggering his larger foe. Barak replied by swinging his axe in a deadly arc, grazing Khonshu&#8217;s chest & drawing blood. The monk skillfully ducked Barak&#8217;s second swing & hit the hapless orc in the armpit. The sudden burst of pain caused Barak to drop his axe. As Barak reached for his broadsword, Khonshu struck him squarely in the throat; the monk&#8217;s outstretched fingers piercing Barak&#8217;s flesh & sinking deeply into the orc&#8217;s windpipe. <br><br>The Crushbone warrior&#8217;s dying gasp gurgled in his throat as he fell. Khonshu paused to briefly lament the unfortunate loss of life when a mysterious force behind him stirred him into action. Wheeling around to face the new threat, Khonshu caught a brief glimpse of his new foes. There in the entranceway of the tent stood a shadow elf clad in the trappings of a necromancer & an Erudite clad in black armor.. Skeletal warriors armed with swords flanked both figures & the eyes of the undead glowed with hellish red motes of light. Neither of the pair introduced themselves, but the shadow elf smiled briefly & spoke. <br><br>&#8220;You should stay out of matters that aren&#8217;t your concern, monk. You should also keep a better eye on your friends.&#8221; <br><br>With that, the necromancer chanted an invocation. His hands crackled with a sickening greenish glow and a bolt of black lightning streaked from his open palm unerringly towards its target. Khonshu watched in horror as the enervation hit Eirik squarely between the shoulder blades. The ranger uttered a silent scream and slumped to the ground: Eirik had no knowledge of nor did he see the nihilistic force that struck him down. The necromancer cast another spell & the pair vanished as quickly as they had appeared. Pandawen & his faith-mates made short work of the remaining orcs, only to find their Elvish companion&#8217;s lifeless body lying still in the bloodstained grass in the camp. Khonshu&#8217;s eyes blazed with cold fury, but the monk said nothing. <br><br>Sian could sense the animosity rising against him in the aftermath of the terrible battle & quickly rose to his own defense. &#8220;I suppose Eirik&#8217;s death is my fault. We saw that blue skinned murderer entering the tent from our vantage point & that was proof enough of Crushbone&#8217;s alliance with the Deathfist.&#8221; <br><br>&#8220;As you have seen,&#8221; Khonshu sternly replied, &#8221;Eirik was struck down by a shadow elf necromancer accompanied by an Erudite Shadow Knight. Thanks to your reckless action, neither Eirik nor myself could gain enough information to discern whether or not the pair acted as individuals or if Neriak & Paineel are somehow involved in this. Saving you from yourself cost Eirik his life & we are no closer to the truth than we were when we started.&#8221; <br><br>&#8220;By Marr, I don&#8217;t believe I like your tone, Ashen.&#8221; Sian reached for his sword, only to be confronted by Pandawen. <br><br>&#8220;The Ashen is correct, brother. We can&#8217;t assume that their appearance here equates to Paineel & Neriak&#8217;s involvement in this & to accuse them would be to invite war. The orc&#8217;s body more than confirms the temple&#8217;s suspicions, but now we aren&#8217;t sure if the orcs are co-conspirators or merely pawns of a greater threat.&#8221; Halyn wiped the gore from her mace & knelt silently next to the fallen elf, weeping the entire time. Her face was a contorted visage of rage & sorrow. Sian was honestly puzzled by his companion&#8217;s reactions to his deed. How dare they take the side of a monk over a fellow member of the faith! The temple would surely hail him as a true harbinger of Mithaniel Marr&#8217;s greater glory. <br><br>As the rain began to fall, Khonshu slowly averted his eyes from Sian & the Ashen became lost in his own thoughts. Was the orc alliance the true threat or merely an advance for more insidious dark force? Emperor Crush could just as easily be an unwitting Neriak pawn as the Deathfist. The concept of Erudite sorcery aiding the shadow elves didn&#8217;t make matters better, nor did the fact that it was a possibility that neither Neriak nor Paineel were involved. The conspiracy could be a plot of an as of yet unseen foe, waiting for the opportunity to sink its fangs into Freeport&#8217;s throat & drink its lifeblood. <br><br>The only thing the companions could do was bury their dead friend, report the details to their superiors, & pray that they would have a second chance to successfully confront the dire force that slowly stirred in Norrath. Although his exterior was calm, an old shadow elf saying echoed in Khonshu&#8217;s sub-conscious, sending waves of trepidation through his mind: <br><br>&#8220;You cannot see the eyes of Innorruk until he comes for you.&#8221;

<P>
Today, most of the average gamers would look at this game and think to themselves, "Damn, this game blows away any other online game out there!" But the games that lead up to this great game should be the ones getting the respect and thanks that gamers give to those who created EverQuest. We will start off back in the most modern gaming system that had any kind of multi-player ability to the games we play now. <P>Some of the older game players might remember back when the big new thing was Atari. With its joystick like controller and its cartridge games it revolutionized and started the gaming world. One of the most basic games that we play may have started the multi-player world. That game would be Pong. Yes you read that right Pong. You may think that I am joking but this is one of the first games to let two friends duke it out one on one in a video game. Pong may look the worst graphic enhanced game yet the people that had Atari were going crazy for the games. PitFall may be one of the first games to have any kind of adventure and exploring in it. Atari hit it big everywhere it was. After a while though the system became so popular that other companies wanted to get in on the money they were making at Atari. <P>The next big thing was the first 16-bit systems that took the video gaming world into a whole new league. Nintendo and the Sega broke into the average person's homes and made the outside look dim. Kids would sit and play games such as Sonic, Mario Bros., Zelda, and even the many sports games out there. Soon enough Nintendo and Sega were breaking records for sales in a day and week as soon as the record was made. Nintendo started up its own magazine soon which started other groups to make ones. Some magazines reviewed both systems games while others only reviewed one systems game. One game that is still going strong started its legacy off here. Some of you may not know but Ultima Online is the complete combination of all the Ultima games leading back to the original one which first ht stands right after the Nintendo did. Ultima is probably one of the longest on going sagas ever to be created. With Nintendo and Sega keeping up with the demand for more and better games decided to bring out the big boys. <P>With the two big names still fighting and now splitting the game world they introduced Super Nintendo and another Sega. These both were now 32-bit systems. With these games sagas continued in better graphics, better sound, and an easier control. About the same time as this the computer world was beginning to pop up with some big hits. Some of their big games were games such as Wolfenstein 3D, MineSweep, and even the basic card games. With the three systems now competing for the spotlight they started to pump out games that had no meaning to it or were games that had topics that no one wanted. Sega tried to jump the gun and threw out Sega Saturn that ended up being a huge mistake. With the fluke here Sega went straight into hiding and let Sony jump in and introduce its new system Playstation. With its huge new graphics and brand new 3D games it made people go nuts. Nintendo was shoved start down to number 2 as Sony took the people to new worlds with their system. The computer world was now just getting into the Internet world and beginning to make contact with areas never talked with before. <P>Nintendo didn't take long to pull out of its Super Nintendo crazy and shoot for Number 1 again. They jumped bandwagon and produced the new N64. This is the time when EverQuest's ancestors began their long journey to the top. With new computer games now coming out every month and the Internet now becoming one of the biggest things since the invention of the phone or wheel. Most of the games at this time were either over the top or still in a 2D. This may seem like a laugh now but we all started of playing the games like Command and Conquer, Doom, and Diablo. These games help introduce the Internet world to the people. C&C started it off with the modem games where you connect to your friend's computer and the play. This kind of connection is used by many games till. Diablo and its maker Blizzard started off probably the first Internet community game. People would log into the Battle.net and then go straight into joining games. Followers and other groups who started this were groups like M Player, Heat.net, and The Zone. The zone would probably be the biggest multi-player community because of its number of games it has under its belt. Then from the bulging blocks of these Ultima Online was created. The first fully Internet based game.<P>Ultima Online sent gamers into the world of Britannia and let them go wild and let their minds wander on what their character should be. With this game setting the stage for it all EverQuest took the idea but created the fully 3D, fully Internet, first shooter, and largest map area ever done.  <P>EverQuest was created not from scratch but was a building process from the beginning of gaming itself.  The game may be the best damn Internet game ever but it wouldn't be where it is without the creations of the original gaming system and the Internet. In my opinion this game is the icon of everything that has ever been created to make a video game better. This game takes eliminate from the original game Pong to the games we play now and combined them all into one and came up with the world we now play in of Norrath. If there were going to ever be a better game I would have to put my money onto a second EverQuest.

<P>
An update to bring you regarding the <a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid955557279,96791,">article</a> we posted yesterday.  Former Guide Desmo sent me the following letter telling his side of the story and included a log of the events and an email he sent to the GM regarding his account:<UL><P>Here's what happened last Thursday night on Lanys.... <P>First some background information. There had very recently been an influx of new guides into the program, myself being one of them. We had been accepted as Apprentice Guides about two weeks prior, and most of the new Appies had just been promoted to full Guide status on Wednesday. Of the Guides that got banned, me (Desmo) and Valdul were very fresh new recruits. Another effect of all the new Guides (about 5 or 6 new, plus the original group of however many) meant that the petition que was very low every time I logged into Lanys. All of the new Guides were "camping" the que so we could get experience answering petitions and have something to do. <P>At the time of the event, the que was totally empty. There were an abundance of Guides online, I'll guess about eight at all times. Ozzadyen mentioned over the guide channel that he was gonna check out the Arena zone and see if anyone was there. He soon informed us that there were over 30 people in the zone, most high level players of the Solidaire guild. He suggested we should go in hidden and start swinging. Note that this wasn't a preplanned event, and that the normal GM of the server wasn't online at the time. I was the first to join him, he was already fighting when I got there. I jumped in beside him and started beating on people with my Swords of Guidance. My strategy was too not kill anyone, and target people that were "taunting" me or trying to draw my attention. Throughout the first round of melee, I had fun trading jests with the other players and I don't think I killed anyone. <P>After awhile, about 25 minutes, I stopped attacking and said I would go outside the PvP area and answer questions that anyone might have. Sort of an informal Answer Circle. That went on for a little while, everyone was doing a good job RP'ing and the mood was very happy and playful. Somehow me and another Guide were set up for a duel, and players were placing having fun placing bets on who would win (me of course :p ). So Valdul and I headed back into the Arena again and faced off, with many players watching. Of course a fully buffed Guide can not be killed, so the duel was for fun anyway. By now the other Guides had shown up, and a duel between Calais the Gnome Kicker and a certain gnome rogue started up. It actually ended with Calais being slain, since he didn't have his GM buff (shapechange50, which grants a whole bunch of hp's and an incredible regen rate. As a warrior I had around 13,500 hp's, and was recovering them at easily 300-500 per tick, in other words, invincible) and Guide equipment isn't really made for fighting. Everyone got a kick outta seeing a corpse with a green name :). Soon another free for all broke out, and everyone was still having a great time. I think I did slay someone this time. I targeted someone who had low hitpoints and didn't notice it until it was too late. If you are reading this, I'm sorry about that, I didn't mean too :( After awhile I called a stop again and we all met up outside the PvP area again for more talk. <P>Note that during this entire time, the que was still be watched by other Guides who weren't in the Arena, and I was also keeping an eye on it myself during the fights. For those that don't know, the GM interface is a transparent overlay that you can have up and still play normally. At no time did anyone to my knowledge complain about what we were doing, quite the opposite in fact. People really seemed to love it, and us Guides were having a blast as well. I was thanked multiple times by players saying they were having a great time. Then things took a turn for the worse. <P>A GM from another server showed up, although I didn't notice at first. I was still talking to players while this new GM was over talking to Ozz. He was just out of range of /say's so I don't know what was said. I soon figured out something was up when all the players starting showing concern for us. That's when I noticed the other GM. Soon after we were all brought to cshome and told to sit down. I'll paste in the transcript below of what we were told, and only edit out the unnecessary stuff. Quite honestly, I didn't know that what we did was wrong. I had been a full Guide for less than 24 hours, and the idea for the Arena event came from the senior Guide on the server. During the verbal lashing we got, they pointed out where it says in the PnP (Guide rule book) that we can't fight other players. The statement is under a section called No Hunting/ Questing/ Crafting/ Shopping/ Begging/ Etc. The section does not stand out in any way from the rest of the book. The sentence that says we can't fight each other or other players is at the end of the section, and it isn't bold or otherwise called out. Notice the "each other" part. That means Guides can't attack Guides. But yet the Guides on Lanys are all PvP flagged, and there is a PvP area in cshome, and the Guides very often swing at each other in a playful manner. In other words, one part of the sentence is not enforced, but instead encouraged, while the next part of the sentence gets you banned instantly with no chance to explain yourself, and insulted at the same time. <P>After being informed how bad of people we were, we were stripped of our Guide status, disconnected, and our entire account suspended. I haven't been able to log in since then, and worse yet can't order RoK because you have to log in to do that. But the story gets worse. <P>Granted I'm a bit biased. Call me crazy but I still enjoy playing the game. I was upset about being treated the way I was, but I have a guild to run with my primary character, and I was looking forward to RoK just as much as anyone. So I sent an email to the Head GM, as I was told to do, and as is normal in a situation like this. But remember this is the the GM that kicked us out in the first place. Her name is Cailleach in game, I won't give her real name or email address. Here's what I sent: <P>--------------- <P><I>Even though I have many thoughts and comments about your decision and their effect on me, I'll keep them to myself. Please remove the banning from my account so I can continue playing my characters on my home servers. <P>username: ******* <P>Also please inform me whether I should purchase the RoK online. I don't want to waste money if I already have a copy on the way due to my former guide status, however slim the chance. <P>Also let me know if there are any further actions I must take in order to continue playing my normal characters back on my normal server, with people that I respect. <P>Lastly, I urge you to revisit your training procedures and the PnP, so that other potential guides are better informed and won't have to go through the same bullshit ordeal I did because of your lousy documentation. Do you honestly think that five different people would all take part in an activity they knew was illegal, and not even mention that fact? And do you feel that a guide of less than 24 hours would know every detail, and question an order or suggestion by his superior? If my actions were a disgrace to Guiding, then your actions are a disgrace to Verant and GM's. And that is not an insult, merely an observation. <P><P>[Thu Apr 06 21:57:32 2000] Cailleach says, 'You are a disgrace.' <P><P>[Thu Apr 06 21:58:05 2000] Cailleach says, 'That is not an insult, merely an observation.' <P>Jer ******, a.k.a. Desmo the Murdered, former guide of Lanys, RIP <P>--------------- <P>And here is what I got in return: <P><b>Your whole attitude about this justifies my decision to refuse to allow you to return, if you ask me. Your account was not banned. It was suspended. I have no idea if Kunark has been sent to you or not, but I'm not going to be concerned about it if it was. <P>Thanks, <P>-- <P>************ <br>Head Game Master <br>Verant Interactive <br>**********@verant.com </b><br></i>-------------- <P>And that's where it is at now. I've honestly pretty much forgotten about it. Hopefully my account will be back up and running tomorrow. Overall, I agree I screwed up by breaking a rule. But I believe the punishment should suit the crime. I would expect to be reprimanded a little, perhaps a message put up on the Guide forums reminding people of the policy, and finally me being watched a little closer to make sure I wasn't a "bad apple." But what did happen was totally uncalled for. I didn't know I would get to play for free when I signed up to be a guide, I didn't know that we would get RoK for free, and I sure as hell didn't know I would be treated like complete dog crap by Verant. I applied to be a Guide because I enjoy helping others. I volunteered more than the required 10 hours per week because I was having fun doing it. <P>To the other Guides on Lanys, I wish you the best. You were all very friendly people, and helpful to a new guide like myself. To Jhek, Lead GM of Lanys, even though you work for Verant, I know you went to bat for me and did what you could. I think you are the best GM I've ever dealt with, and others share my opinion. To any of the other Guides that were banned with me and feel somewhat guilty, don't sweat it. I have no hard feelings towards you at all. To all the rest of Verant that agrees what happened to me was justified, I return to you my Sword of Guidance. <P>Former Guide Desmo, currently just another player like the rest of you. <P>Log of the Event:</b><P>----------- <P>[Thu Apr 06 21:52:57 2000] You have been summoned by the gods!<P>[Thu Apr 06 21:52:57 2000] LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<P>[Thu Apr 06 21:53:14 2000] You have entered Sunset Home.<P>[Thu Apr 06 21:53:21 2000] You say, 'Hail'<P>[Thu Apr 06 21:53:22 2000] Axgoreth says, 'Have a seat Desmo'<P>[Thu Apr 06 21:53:25 2000] Calais says, 'what section of the Pnp please?'<P>[Thu Apr 06 21:53:41 2000] Cailleach says, 'You are not to be engaging in combat with players or one another while in your guide character.'<P>[Thu Apr 06 21:53:48 2000] Cailleach says, 'Are you unaware of that?'<P>[Thu Apr 06 21:53:52 2000] Ozzadyen says, 'Then why are we all PVP/'<P>[Thu Apr 06 21:53:59 2000] Tanden tells the guild, 'Guys if they kick Ozza, who's for camping right then and letting them run this server until they get him back? :)'<P>[Thu Apr 06 21:54:09 2000] Aidan tells you, 'whats up man you guys didnt get in too much trouble i hope......'<P>[Thu Apr 06 21:54:11 2000] Cailleach says, 'There is really no point discussing this.'<P>[Thu Apr 06 21:54:18 2000] Calais says, 'what section please?'<P>[Thu Apr 06 21:54:21 2000] You say, 'I was unaware, yes.

<P>
A very unusual situation took place on the Lanys T'Vyl server recently.  Five guides were stripped of their rank and status and had all of their EQ accounts, guide and regular, banned.  The first report I've decided to post was sent by an anonymous resident of Lanys V'Tyl:  <BLOCKQUOTE>Ozzadyen, Calais, Desmo, Valdul, and Tygira--five Guides--were apparently stripped of their authority and fully banned from Everquest for participating in PVP action with regular players at the Lake Rathetear Arena on Thursday night of Lany's Tvl.  <P>This experience, prior to the banishment of the Guides, showed to us that Guides were players like us, that they cared about us, and that they like to have as much fun as us!<P>Whatever rule the Guides broke by battling players in the Arena does not justify the punishment handed down by Verant! What harm was done? Are Guides never to interact with players outside of either Customer Service Issues or Verant-sanctioned events? What about weddings? In many cased, GMs or Guides preside over or conduct the ceremonies. Will this now be cause for banishment? <P>All people on Lanys are sad to have lost 5 guides. We want them back! </BLOCKQUOTE>The second is a letter that has been written to the public by former Senior Guide Ozzadyen.  Here's a copy of it:<BLOCKQUOTE>I was once known as Ozzadyen a Senior Guide of Povar for a long time and Lanys T`Vyl for a very short time. I devoted almost a year of my time to helping others and giving them some enjoyment. I was released from the program for Improper behavior for going to the Arena and having fun with players on Lanys T`Vyl. <P>Now that I am no longer a part of the Everquest Guide program I can freely speak and I have every intention of doing so. First off Verant was on a Witch hunt to get me removed from the program anyway, because I was very unhappy with what had happened during the Rending of the Veil Part 4 on Xegony and let them know this. It was brought to my attention that there were 2 Councils on Xegony Councils of Light and Councils of Dark. On each of these councils were 5 players for a total of ten players. The Heads of these two councils were guides. At the end of the Veil 4 Quest a member on the Council of Light Allora was awarded the Title and Veeshan Claw. I found this very disturbing and wrong they have 10 Elite players on Xegony now and 1 was awarded a Title and an Artifact know as the Chyrstalline Claw of Veeshan. <P>Now while for the most part the Guide program is not to blame I will miss everyone there I worked with and knew for the last year. Go easy on those Guides, Apprentices and Seniors they are only doing what Verant directs them if they Deviate at all Like I did last night this is what happens to them. I have absolutely no respect for anyone at all in Verants upper Echelon, they rule with an Iron fist and use those in the Guide program without ever thanking them. Should something go wrong they immediately blame this huge Volunteer force they have. These Volunteer Players provide 85% or better of Verants Customer Service on a daily ongoing basis. I was told I was a disgrace I found this very amusing coming from the Upper Echelon of Verant GM staff. There are some GM's that are genuinely great and care about the players, but they are Temporary staff so even they live under the threat of a Hatchet day in and day out if they do not do what they are told.<P>But we learn, and we go on, perhaps you will hear more from me. There were others with me this night who helped provide great entertainment for several players not just 10 Elite ones like on Xegony. To Calais the Gnome Kicker, Tygira is Stark Raving Mad, Valdul, and Desmo, all these Guides, Verant immediately removed from the program, and Suspended their accounts. To them I give my deepest apologizes.  I was the Senior Guide, and had I not gone to the Arena none of the others would have followed because of me they lost there rights and access to there playing accounts I can in no way tell them how sorry I am and repay them for that. They were the best damn people you would have ever wanted to meet. Every last guide I had the pleasure of meeting and working with on Povar and Lanys T`Vyl in the last year were the greatest. The Senior staff and every last soul in the Guide program devote endless hours of devotion and time to help make EQ what it is today and they do this with Thanks from the players and not a single thank you from Verant. So ends the tail of Ozzadyen Servant to Lanys once Ozzadyen Servant to Povar, those always were my titles and I always lived up to them. <P>Now another thing that really gets to me is players are given warnings. As a guide in the program you are given no such Luxury not only was I immediately suspended but every account I had has been suspended, all of them, not just my guide account but every account I have. This fact alone is pretty interesting as a member in Verants CS program you are treated far worse then even the most stubborn player that refuses to share a spawn and disrupts an entire zone, even they are given the common courtesy of only having there one account suspended.<P>Ozzadyen no More.Safe travels in the Lands of Norrath friends and may thee be Karana's flood and wash over thy enemies.</BLOCKQUOTE>Obviously he broke the rules, but after reading this many EverQuest players are asking if such an extreme action was really necessary.  Guides aren't an abundant source.  They devote hours of their time each week to do service to the community.  Good ones are hard to come by, and harder to keep.  Certainly a program as important and vital to EverQuest must have rules, but because of one insignificant and pointless incident good guides can be banned instantly and without a second thought? <P>To voice your opinion of this issue please leave a news comment or visit a <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?mes=5427887&replies=0">specially created board thread</a> on the Player Views Board.

<P>
"So yer off to see the war are ye?" inquired the man behind the counter.<br>Toadentrop politely smiled and payed the man in gold for the passage slip and made his way back out of the  building. He knew what would be waiting for him. A reception that he was not exactly prepared for.  His comrades of this past year would be just outside ready to make one last bid to talk him out of going.  But this, this was his home in danger, and their homes.  Quickly his eyes adjusted to the bright haze that hangs in the square out side the Freeport customs house, and there they were. <br><br>Though there is a wide variety of peoples in Freeport it certainly was easy to spot his bunch. The first to catch his eye was Zerkernaut, a giant of a troll, clad in the spiky thorny armor that was favored by his kind. Toadentrop had to chuckle to him self as he thought, "he is actually trying to blend into the background and be inconspicuous."  Just to the right of Zerkernaut was Shimmian a tall half elven woodsman from the Qeynos hills. He too was trying to be nonchalant, leaning on his great ash bow as if he weren't terrified of the din that was at the heart of the city. To the left of  Shimmian was Lady Esme. As she stood in the square, all three foot nine inches of her,  she amongst the group seemed the most at ease. All the same it was clear to Toadentrop that Esme would rather not be here. <br>Standing in front of the group with arms crossed, was a wood elf  maid,  the scowl on her face made her usually fawney eyes look hard and sharp. Her chestnut hair and sun-browned cheeks reminded him of a face he'd seen long ago, but that was a far away place and this was after all her sister, Mythrial.<br><br>"I will have words with you, Toadentrop," she said calmly.<br><br>Changing the subject he knew would do him no good, "stand your ground,"he thought, "that what Dwarven warriors do best." Steeling himself he said, "My gear's all packed, I've got my passage, I'm going."<br><br>At that Lady Esme piped up and asked in her strong voice, "Why?"<br><br>Toadentrop fumbled about in his head for an answer, just one answer but he could not. <br><br>Before he could frame a thought in his head Shimmian said, "the Lad Looks thirsty, I'm thirsty. Let's talk this over, over an ale or two, over yonder," pointing to Powel's pub with the end of his bow, "The troll's buying."<br><br>"Huh?" was about all Zerkernaut could say before the ranger started herding the group into the bar.<br>The ranger had chosen well for the place was not crouded and the group quickly found a place to sit, save Zerkernaut who chose not to test the strength of the chair and opted to stand. <br>The whole time Toadentrop could feel Esme's and Mythrials eyes on him, burning holes in his very being.<br>Shimmian motioned to the barmaid, "Dwarven Ale's all around."<br><br>At  this Toadentrop stood apologizing, "I really must board my ship..."<br><br>"Nonsense!" laughed Shimmian, "there is plenty of time before the ship sails. Plenty of time to tell us why you wish to go." <br><br>" Yes, tell me Dear heart, why do you wish to go off and get yourself killed?" asked Mythrial.<br><br>"It's a war!, in my home, Your home Milady, " Toadentrop started to say.<br><br>"You don't know that." interrupted Esme.<br><br>"Milady, I have heard, you yourself  heard Lady Lyrikal's report about The Crushbone..."<br><br>"They don't know it was Emporer Crushbone's Orcs."  interrupted Esme.<br><br>"It was Crush alright, it has the smell of Crush." Said Toadentrop<br>At that moment Toadentrop heard The Troll snort. he got a puzzled look on his face  and then began to speak. "Whut you Do when You gets der.?" asked the troll.<br><br>"I will Join the..." started Toadentrop.<br><br>"Stormguard, and defend Kaladim from the evil marauding Orc legionaries... and get yourself cut to pieces or blown to flinders by some Orc Shaman." Interrupted Mythrial.<br><br>"Milady..." started Toad.<br><br>"That place isn't your home anymore, dear Toadentrop, you have a home here with us now...  Why are you so determined to get ..." interjected Esme.<br><br>"Neither was the Kith Milady, when the dead walked in the Forrest's of Kith, who was the first to rally to your cry?" said Toad proudly. <br><br>"Nay it wasn't and Aye you were, but it I spent 2 seasons nursing you back to health from the wounds you got there, and you still walk with a limp." Said Mythrial. "Why had it not been for Shimmian here you would be wandering the forrest now as a haunted spirit. You Blasted Fool!"ranted Mythrial," You heard Zerkernaut call the retreat, and you stood your ground!" as She continued she began to punctuate each word  by slamming her fist onto the table," Stubbornness Is not heroic! Its Foolish! I know you! You will get into battle and when things start to go badly the Watch captain will call a retreat and you will insist on being the rear guard and hold them while the rest retire. You will be dead, because you are stubborn." <br>By now there was more beer on the table than in the mugs.<br><br>"She's right you know," said Esme. "What good will one more sword do on any account?"<br><br>"Lord Irone went, and don't just say that He's Just another sword." Said the Dwarf.<br>Shimmian got pale and replied, "Aye, and he hasn't been heard from since"<br><br>"Da Stormguard is tough, but iffn da word I herd is, da Tree City is Gone, da whole Wood elf  army gone, fey burnin n black, Ifn dat so, nuttin gonna stop Crush." stated the Troll.<br>As Zerkernaut spoke Toadentrop noticed  tears welling up in Mythrial's eye. It seemed to the dwarf that the She-elven Druidess really did care deeply about her homeland. <br><br>"Don't tell me, err,  us that Lady Lyrikal has put you  up to this." scolded Mythrial. "I'll..."<br><br>"You'll what?" Asked Esme. "Let us all just calm ourselves a moment... this is serious business and serious business is for cool heads. That goes especially for you." Directing her last comment at the dwarf.<br><br>"We all appreciate your Loyalty to your Patron and his Wife, but" started Shimmian<br><br>"No, no 'Buts' and yes,  Some of why I go is for Lady Lyrikal's sake, though she never bid me so, and knowing her, were she to know I was Bound for Kaladim she would be here at this table trying to stop me." pleaded Toadentrop. "Whilst I was Lady Lyrikal's sword theign, and shield, I faced many dangers, but not out of obligation, out of love and respect for my Master,and his charge. Why it was Lady Lyrikal that Introduced me to you Dear  Mythrial , and," Toadentrop paused, "your sister Illiamian."<br><br>"I remember that day, my father despised you, but out of difference to the Song Mistress Lyrikal tolerated you." said Mythrial "Illiamain, LilKitty, was fascinated by you. I was trying to get ready for my first trip across the sea to converse with the treants of  South Karana, and all she did was pester me about you. That day... Twas the last I saw of her."<br><br>"Aye," Said Toadentrop, "and I am sorry."<br> <br>There was a long silence, just enough time for a tear to roll down Toadentrop's face. it was this that caused the Troll to speak."Toad, you naut resp... resp... tu blame fer Lilkitty's death, Orc's Kill her She go in look araound get caught get killd, Shalisar tell me, You tried hard rescue her while she Livin, then almost die yerself gettin her body so's Orc's not disp... disop... desecret... ruin her body. Dat brave, stupid, but brave enough." <br><br>Toadentrop sat  with a glazed expression on his face gazing into Mythrial's eyes. <br><br>Esme touched the dwarf  on his shoulder and asked, "Are you Alright?"He tugged at his braided beard to steel himself. Esme continued, "Good squire, When I found you Lost and hungry in Freeport you told me that you had to find a druidess  in these lands, when I told you, you were fortunate enough to find one, you did not laugh, it was then that I knew that your travels were of  a serious nature, Twas then you told me you bore a message for Mythrial daughter  to Eldwith and Irenith." Esme paused, "The dread news, and important names clouded my mind a bit. but I can see you now as you were then, your beard sir, twas braided as it is now..." All eyes were directed at long black strands dangling from the dwarf's chin. "Tis the way an Elf maid marks her bo,  braids in her love's hair, is it not? Elven Love braids? At the time I had not seen many of your kind and thought nothing of it, but now, Squire, I have never seen any Dwarf with beard braided so."<br><br>Mythrial Raised an eyebrow. <br><br>Esme continued, "Good squire, there is more to this. A tale to tell perhaps, Hmmm?" There was a pause and Esme prodded Toadentrop, "Come Sir, if we are to send you off to your certain death we must know this. Lest the story perish with you, sounds to me to be an epic tale, would be a shame were it to die with ye."<br><br>The first words from Toadentrop's lips were, "Dear lady, I am sorry" It seemed to Toadentrop that those were the words he greeted lady Mythrial every chance they met. Yet he continued, "That day and the days after were the happiest in my life, and the saddest." the dwarf paused to sip his beer. "After we conducted you to the port and put you on that ship, Lady Mythrial,  I thought I would never see The misty woodlands of your home again. but for some reason my mistress had business in the Tree city. It suited me just fine while Lady Lyrikal was in conference or just in the city she would dismiss me for a time. and that left me free to explore. On the very first adventure through the wood, I came upon Illiamian.  Or rather, was ambushed by Illiamian, for she was a master of concealment and sprang upon me unawares. I can still smell the honeysuckle in her hair..."<br><br>The Troll Snorted and snuffed... "Me think Dwarf make that up. All me smell is Beer and Hobbit feets."<br>At that Esme shot an Icy look at the Troll.<br><br>"Please continue" Said Mythrial. her soft brown eyes narrowing on the dwarf.<br><br>Toadentrop explained, "We tumbled about in the moss and fallen leaves, at first I struggled but when I knew <br>what or rather who had pounced on me I relented. At that Illiamian said, 'Huh! Some great dwarven warrior you are!' and then she laughed, twas  a musical laughter that rings in your heart, I knew I was falling in love. She teased me yet again "had I been an Orc You'd have been  dead. I said, ' perhaps lady' it was when i tried to address her in her Elven name  which was hard for me  to pronounce, that she bade me address her as Lilkitty."  Toadentrop continued " I explained that I had slain many orcs and this was true, orc pawns are still orcs, to which she replied 'the mighty Dwarf protector needs a protector' and she smiled. Twas that moment the Orc chose to interrupt our chat. He grabbed and scratched at my Lilkitty, and I leapt. Two short strokes with my blade and the orc was slain. She was shaken but unharmed. I honestly do not know who was more frightened, yet we laughed. I told her that she needed a protector too. she assured me that she was safe the whole time. She giggled and cast a spell, there was a flash and she was gone."<br><br>Mythrial interrupted , "Father would not let us play in the glade until we had learned the spell of escape." <br><br>Toadentrop continued, "In the days that followed, Lady Lyrikal had many more conferences, and so I had free time to spare, and each day I spent with Lilkitty. We would dine on the forrest berries,  frolic and play,  one particular game was our favorite, Hide and seek. Milady was an expert at hiding I truly believe even a scent hound would not have found her had she wished it. I might spend an hour looking only to have her spring from her hiding place and catch me unawares. Twas during such a game  that we encountered Shalisar the Wolf prince. I was routing about through ferns seeking My dear Lilkitty, when I  hear a booming voice, "Stand and be recognized!' I stood slowly so as not to startle my challenger. Must be My quarry too decided to stand, as she emerged beside me, for I heard  a peal of joyous booming laughter. They spoke in a tongue I did not understand. After a few moments Lilkitty started to speak in common and said to <br>the man, 'Lord Shalisar of The Hallas Wastes, please meet and greet  master Toadentrop Sword Theign to Lyrikal Song mistress Of Kethen.' It was then That Shalisar bowed before me. The Great Shalisar! I nearly fell over dead." Toadentrop excitedly continued. "I do not know if I spoke or just stood and shook... he laughed and spoke more to Lilkitty and then turned to me and warned  not to stray too far from the Glade that we were close to The Crush and dare not go any closer as there was trouble brewing. I thanked him and he said some words in parting to Lilkitty, and we were alone again. So we found a Sunny hillock to sit upon and we began one of our long talks, this was an important day,and I had important news that I was reluctant to divulge, but as we talked Lilkitty began to braid my beard. as she did so she sang a soft song... almost in whispers, as she worked I drifted and dreamed, and when she was done she announced that she knew that Lady Lyrikal's business was almost complete and that since we would be apart for a bit she was going to mark me. i knew not what she meant but was relieved that she knew and was not too saddened, that it would be some time before we could meet again. She Laughed and pushed me over and said 'One last Game of Hide  and seek! If you can find me, you can kiss me!'"<br><br>Shimmian asked, "how did you know she had hidden in the Crushbone pass?"<br><br>Tears were welling up in Toadentrop's eyes, "Alas she was not, but I did not know the lands, and I was determined  to find and win my kiss. So as I wandered and sought I had the misfortune upon finding the pass to the Crush. I knew not where I was, yet I had heard Shalisar's warning, but fool that I am I heeded it not. A kiss from an angel was worth any danger to me, and surely Lilkitty would not hide anywhere dangerous, I thought to myself. The whole experience was surreal I knew not of the danger I was in until it was suddenly upon me... As I wandered about seeking Milady I had passed and not noticed two Orc Centurions and an Orc Shaman. They, however knew of me and were setting me up for some vicious trap no doubt, for a thick misty fog started rolling in about me. Just as The centurion was about to grasp me I heard  Lilkitty cry, 'Look Out behind you!'" At that moment she emerged from some thick brush. I turned and pushed the beast into the Orc shaman who was casting some foul spell that was producing more fog. Some how the second centurion  leapt passed me and straight at Lilkitty. As I Drew my blade I knew I would never close the distance before the Orc would be on her and this was no pawn brandishing its's claws this was a full grown centurion armed with a wicked Spear. I was relieved as I saw Milady start to cast. Ahh my love will escape I thought,  She was staring at me, I knew I was doomed, but I would go down fighting  and My love would be safe. The last friendly face I would see would be hers, it was then that she completed her incantation."<br><br>"A Fissel?" Lady Esme Asked excitedly.<br><br>Toadentrop's face was pale and ghastly, "Just as Lilkitty finished her incantation there was A stroke of lightening behind me, and I was awash in orc Blood and cinders. The Orcs behind me must have been back on their feet and after me,  It seemed the whole world stood still  a split second later, I saw...." Toadentrop was shaking now, "The orc stabbed... The spear was buried deeply into her chest, and she grasped the spear tightly as she fell. I could.. her rasping breath... The Orc grinned and turned on me, He had been disarmed but he was determined to kill me too. much of that battle I do not remember after the first blow, but some how I survived. I stood over the broken orc's body and shivered. The mist was thick and now though I could not see them I heard the din and shouts of the denizens of Crush, they were out  to find the source of the commotion. in the midst of this I heard... Milady forgive me, I heard that rasping breath..." I began to feel about in the mist for the my fallen love, when There was a pair of huge hands about me and suddenly I was being hauled upon an immense man's shoulder at a full run."<br><br>Toadentrop buried his face in his hands a moment, "I struggled at first thinking I was Being born into Crush castle, it was then when I noticed the my captor, was wearing not orc armor but a wolf skin cape, and was being shot full of arrows as he ran. Shalisar had heard Lilkitty's lightening stroke and ran in to assist. Only to find me  about to be overwhelmed. He did what he could he grabbed me and effected an escape. I know not how he kept his feet, or what magic kept him alive even but  suddenly I heard the song of lady Lyrikal.<br>Shalisar fell to his knee's and set me down. the great lady asked if I was hurt, I said no. She asked where Mistress Illiamian was, my tear was enough of a reply.  'Dread things happen to those that fall in the Valley of Crush,  We must... recover or destroy the body, lest Illiamian become a banshee, a tourchered spirit doomed to immortal torment.' That was enough for me. I shall go, I told her. I will save her spirit or die trying. <br>"You will need help." she said. and with that she drew the great sword at Shalisar's side and handed it to me."<br><br>There was a gasp throughout the room. <br><br>"I did not know it at the time but in my hands was the sword of souls. In my hands was a weapon that gave me some of the strength from each of the thousands of victims slain by the blade. Had I known I held such a weapon I might not have entered  the Crush valley  to keep the blade from falling into vile hands. Yet I did not know. Again I was in a surreal state. I knew only one thing, find my love. I know not how but when next I saw Lady Lyrikal I was carrying the broken form of my lady over my shoulder much the way Shalisar had done me and I was handing the sword back to the great lady.  I saw Shalisar sleeping quietly  apparently out of deaths grip, Only then did I collapse."<br><br>"When I awoke I was in a house in the trees, there was much sadness at the funeral. the whole city turned out all dressed in black. and under a starry sky Illiamian Druidess Of the Greater Fey, was laid to rest at the base of a Great oak." <br><br>"A sadder tale could not be told." shuddered Esme drying tears  with a kerchief.<br><br>Mythrial sat speechless.<br><br>"I am sorry Milady,  That day your sister, my love, gave her life to save me, rather than escape, and I failed her, I believe though she was dyeing she lived still when I was wisked away. I am sorry...." Toadentrop fell to his knees. "Twas that day that I vowed that I should never retreat until the fallen have been recovered, and the injured are safe. I will not fail, I will not betray milady's gift again... I cannot hide here in safety while the lands  of  my dearest love are imprisoned. ...Oh my, I am so sorry...."<br><br>Mythrial cradled Toadentrop's head in her lap and began to cry. <br><br>"Silly Dwarf," she said between her tears, "you know you should have bought enough passes for the five of us ."<br><br>              *               *               *             *            *          *           *           *           *           *           *<br><br>The bell on the Aria tolled three times as a warning that the ship would soon depart. Five figures  stood on the main deck at the rail each looking at the city of Freeport as if it might be the last time they saw it. Two amongst them were probably the most uneasy about the departure, the tallest, Zerkernaut, and the shortest, lady Esme. Doublely so for they were leaving the land of their birth,  to travel to a place where few or none of their kind dwelt. <br><br>Just as the Aria's bell began to toll again, there was an obvious commotion on the docks. A tall man wearing  a wolf pelt cloak raced to the end of the pier. The ship was already cast off and  more that ten strides from the end of the dock. The man with mad determination leapt arms flailing and landed rolling on the deck. <br><br>"You didn't expect to sneak off and save Fedwer without me?" panted Shalisar.<br><br>A puzzled look appeared on Toadentrop's face.<br><br> "Lady Lyrikal thought you might try some fool's errand and asked me to keep an eye out for you, and aye, before you ask, she asked me to stop you, but I know my heart, and I know yours is no less. I cannot bring myself to do as she bids." said the nomad prince between breaths.<br><br>"How did you know I would be leaving this day, from here?" wondered the dwarf.<br><br>Shalisar chuckled, "Just how many trolls walk about freely in Freeport?" Looking at Zerkernaut, "How are you My good Runt?" Turning back to Toadentrop, "Just how many travel in the company of a dwarf lad? T'was easy enough to ponder out your plan." <br><br>"We are honored to have you in our midst," said Esme with a bow.<br><br>Shimmian nudged Toadentrop and pointed out the ship's steward and master at arms were approaching. "Right. I must ask to show me your boarding pass sir." said the Steward.<br><br>"I have none." said Shalisar.<br><br>The Master at arms bristled, "Then I must ask you to..."<br><br>"It's all right he can stay," the captain called down from the Aft-deck, "he can keep an eye on that troll. Now, back to work! Steward, check the stores  and see to the cargo. Mister Ager, see to the watch, there will be a full moon and that means the furies will be sporting about!"<br>With that the crew set about their work.<br><br>"Aye, Runt, you better stay in line," Shalisar laughed.<br><br>"Me do." laughed Zerkernaut.<br><br>And so he company cast one last silent gaze at the city disappearing into the distance and decided to wander below decks to find accommodations. Normally even though the Aria was a large ship, the passengers were often asked to share cabins. T his was not the case on this voyage. It seemed the crossing's popularity had faded since the outbreak of war. With the exception of Zerkernaut who preferred the open air of the fore-deck, each made them selves at home in their own cabin. The ward room where they were to take their meals was large considering it was aboard a ship. The food was fair if a bit plain, and lacking variety. For they served fish chowder and flat bread for lunch and supper and  breakfast was flat bread with either berry preserves or clover honey.  <br><br>On the second night, over the evening meal,  Esme broke the silence, "I should hope we make good time, my stomach is not..."<br><br>"It's not my stomach objecting," interrupted Mythrial. "Fish chowder... makes one wonder what kind of fish..."<br><br>"Mmm naut bad," slurped the troll, "Taste like toad." with that came the sound of five spoons being dropped into their bowls. "MMmmm you mind if I finish yers?" asked Zerkernaut motioning to Mythrial with is spoon.<br><br>Silently and with visible disgust Mythrial pushed her bowl over for the troll.<br><br>For a time the group sat in silent horror as Zerkernaut ate, and it was Shimmian who broke the din silence by asking, "Well, this seems to be an ideal time for me to quench a curiosity of mine.<br>You see I am student of language, and of culture, yet I must confess your name has been a bit of a puzzle to me, lad." Looking straight at the dwarf, "It means Falling Frog? How did you land yourself a moniker like that?"<br><br>"Frogs falling actually." Esme interjected.<br><br>"Aye, to speak it plainly, tis true, my name means frogs falling." The dwarf  answered.<br><br>Hiding a smile Mythrial prodded, "And...."<br><br>"I was named by those that found me, you see I was born and orphaned on the same day. On the same day... " reflected the dwarf. "I am told that  the day before King Xobe and the vast Runny Eyed goblin tribe were defeated and forced to flee The Butcher Block, there was  a huge storm. A storm the likes of which none has seen before or since. Great winds and thunder roared  through the valley of Kaladim.  In the flat beyond the city gates there once was a small trading villiage. The storm laid waste to it and killed most of those that lived there.<br>The hail and wind and rain was too much for the wood framed huts that most had built there. Oddly, and cruelly it seemed that the gods has played a jest on the peoples there, for along with the hailstones, and inside some were frogs... thousands of frogs. <br> My mother's broken body was found  in the rubble that was the villiage, clinging to her newborn son. I was born before a great bitter-sweet victory for my people. I was born on a day that was unforgettable, and to be sure my foster parents placed the responsibility of commemorating the day on me... I was born on the day It stormed so hard that Frogs fell from the heavens..."<br><br>The table suddenly rumbled, as Zerkernaut belched. When he was finished he smiled and said, "You  alot like me den,  you named troll fashioned. You have good name."<br><br>Coughing and waving his hand before his face, Shimmian asks,"Lord Zerkernaut, your name is a puzzle to me as well."<br><br>Shalisar clears his throat a bit and begins to laugh.<br><br>"I'm not as familiar with the language of trolls as i should be," starts Mythrial, "Zer... small I think" <br><br>"Ker?  Is it pup? Cub?" Esme interrupts, "Smallest Pup... but the last of it is a puzzle."<br><br>Shimmian "RUNT? Thats your name? You have to be the biggest Troll I have ever seen!"<br><br>Shalisar chuckled, "Aye, he is no longer a Runt, but since there is no word in troll for no longer, The Runt became  Runt Not, Zerkernaut... You have to understand our troll  friend here was not raised in Oggok  by his mother.  Mygatz bore three that spring, a large brood for trollkind. Zerkernaut's other two brood-brothers  were big and strong, green and scaley from the start,  Zerker here was tiny, and grey, just clinging to life for the first days. Mygatz faced a tough choice for her littlest one. It is common for Troll runts to be torn to bits and eaten by their broodmates or even their older siblings. Sometimes to save the welp from suffering  the mother of a sickly trolling will eat it on the spot.<br><br>Esme turned very pale at this and  Mythrial looked as if she was about to wretch, "That is horrid!"<br><br>"Aye it may seem that way to you, but troll kind live in a hard place. They live by hard rules. It is as it is. so that they can live in their land. Trolls are not evil by nature, they just have a strong will to live, and will do shocking things to stay alive. Oft times a person will have an ill run in with trolls in their homeland, simply because  to most trolls if it lets you eat it, it's food." explained Shalisar. "I was saying, Mygatz had a tough choice,  I came accross whilst I was wandering the Inthule on an errand for a friend. I had never beheld a weeping troll. I asked why she wept. Mygatz told me of her intention to abandon her welp to save it from her other children. She could not eat her son, and could not protect him from her kind. So I took the welp.  I  told her that he would be safe and that I would find someone to raise him. So it was that I bore our friend here to Ixucha." <br><br>Shimmian's Eyes widened, "The Witch of Inthule?"<br><br>"Aye," replied Shalisar. <br><br>"Tog'tog Ixucha, be outcast like me, she make gud mom for me. Feed me. Make me swim. Make me break wood. She teach, me learn. Onlyiest troll I see for two springs was Tog'tog. Shalisar teached me too. When I ask why I seen no other like me day say cause I'm Zerker," said the troll.<br><br>"Then there came the day that your brother's  Yerpes and Uganh, discovered that your mother had broken troll-law by letting you live, " continued Shalisar. "Mygatz paid for that crime by being eaten."  <br><br>Toadentrop grasped his eathenware mug so tightly that it crumbled spilling the sour ale he was drinking all over the table.<br><br>"Uganh was not satisfied with half justice, so he set out to find the meal  he was denied as a welp. He roamed deep into the Swamp to find Zerker here," continued Shalisar. " Find him he did." <br><br>"I were breakin wood for da fire when I hear dis chunchin splashin roar.  I looked and I see A troll runnin at me. Me start to say hey an da cleaver Uganh was swingin hacked into me. Me think Uganh was suprised when cleaver stuck on my shoulder and not come free. Me slamm da air outta him an he leggo of da cleaver. <br>When he get back up he start claw'n and punchen.  I slamm agin, and he fall, he back up, claw, I slamm he fall agin. Dis time he fall hard I tink he trip on broke up wood. I look an it worse, he fell on broken off tree da stump is sticken true his back an outta his belly. Me never see'd so much blood.  He point at cleaver and ask why I not dead yet. He say It poisoned, I should be dead... I ask him why he kill me an He tell me bout Mother, an Yerpes, and den Uganh cough the black blood, an died. Me not know much o wut happen next. Me feel weak an sick Me wander off to find Tog'tog..."<br><br>"You wandered off? I found you in the desert of North Ro, shivvering and delerious from poison. You mean to tell me you got that Cleaver cut in The Swamp of Inthule? You must have walked for 4 days to get where I found you!" exclaimed Mythrial. <br><br>"Me remember you dat day, me tink me dead and gone to...  Me never see'd a Elfie before..." said Zerkernaut. <br><br>"How ironic, The first Troll he'd ever met tried to kill him, and the first Elf he met saved his life." interjected Esme. "Just one think still, you said you lived with Ixucha for two springs after you were born so... and you have been traveling with Mythrial for a year now... You are three Years old?" <br><br>Shalisar laughs, "Three and a half now. Trolls grow up very fast."<br><br>The group began to laugh, but was cut short by a clamor above deck.<br><br>The Aria's bell rang loudly and the master at arms could be heard barking instructions for the crew to take arms.<br><br>Shimmian, being closest to the door was the first on deck. Springing behind him was Shalisar. Mythrial, Esme and Toadentrop brought up the rear.  The Fury's ship was long sleek and bone grey.  The Aria was a swift ship under full sail but by some cruel twist of fate they were becalmed, The oars of the fury craft were beating the water  like a wasp's wings. The distance closed rapidly. <br><br>"Why do we just sit here?" asked Esme.<br><br>"We are becalmed, there is no wind. No wind in the sails and we go nowhere..." shouted the Captain.<br><br>Mythrial looked at Esme and without words it seemed they knew eachother's thought. They Grasped hands and began the chant.<br><br>Closing now the ships were within bowshot of eachother and so Shimmian began to shoot. and the furies replied. Esme was nearly struck by an arrow as the two continued their labor, chanting and circling with arms intertwined. The wind  started first as a faint gust of a breeze, then grew. As the Sails filled the ship bagan to move. It seemed they would be saved. Still The fury ship closed. Toadentrop looked at Shalisar and the look in his eyes told him that they would be boarded...<br><br><br>The crew of the Aria rushed to arm themselves, but belaying pins and a few cutlasses in the hands of  the crewmen would  not be enough to keep the ship from being taken. As the grappling hooks started <br>flying  Toadentrop  felt   his stomach welling up in is throat.  The Fury's ship was close enough  so that he could see  whom he was about to face.  he had heard about  the horrid  ghoulish mermen  that plain folk  called sea furies, but he never expected to see any. Green slimey skin stretched over a short very muscular frame, dark dead eyes, and snapping jaws filled with needle like fanglets, made thies  creatures as horrid to look at as they were deadly. To add  insult to injury, each was armed with either a stout steel blade and a shield  or an oddly shaped bow and arrows. Zerkernaut stormed accross the deck chopping the entangleing lines  from the enemy ship. For every one he cut  it seemed  three more  would  strike the deck.<br><br>The ships drew together with a crash and there arose a deep warbling warcry from the Furies.  Toadentrop planted his feet on the deck deliberately  between  the Fury ship and the druidesses. Suddenly over the rail of the Aria came a wave of furies. The young dwarf  felt  the moments distill down, as if time  had slowed.<br>Toadentrop watched as Zerkernaut, Shalisar, and Shimmian threw themselves on the first throng. The crew rallied  and pressed the invaders back but at a horrid cost. Again  the Cry  came from the Deck of the Fury ship and again the dark green forms launched themselves  over the rail with steel and Fangs flashing. This time there were fewre defenders to throw them back.  The line seemed to have broken and A pair of furies rushed  right at Lady Mythrial and Esme. Toadentrop buried the point of his sword into the first  and  wheeled  about throwing  the crumpled  form into the rushing second. The acrid smell of the creatures blood stung has he breathed. The other regained it's feet and scrambled  to get  the lady druids. The young dwarf  hurled himself  on the back of the creature  and was surprised to see that it was already dead  slashed nearly in twain by Lady Mythrial's  scimitar.  Looking back  Toadentrop saw that the second wave  had been thrown back. Some of the crewmen that had fallen  and some of the wounded  were dragged  overboard  by retreating furies. Their  cries and a sickening munching sound could be heard  from  the deck of the fury ship.<br> <br>Toadentrop glanced about. he could see Zerkernaut, bleeding from a wound  in is left arm. Shimmian scratched and bleeding horridly, and Shalisar. Shalisar seemed to be un hurt, a blessing at least. But there were  few others standing to meet the inevitable third wave.  As the gurgling roar began on the ship below, Toaden heard a desperate chant from behind him. The flash blinded friend and foe alike for some time. Lady Esme's lightening bolt struck near the bow of the fury ship and lady Mythrial's  near the aft. The Air hung with the stench of ozone, and burnt flesh. Taking advantage of the chaos Zerkernaut who seemed  not to have been blinded  started to cut the lines. The Fury ship was ablaze and drifting off...  To all the battle seemed to have been won. Toadentrop  could see  a curious movement on the deck of the crippled  Raider craft. The furies scrambled to  uncover a large device on the aft deck of the ship. A war engine, like a gigantic crossbow... It was unlimbered and  set. Toaden stood shocked as it was pointed directly at him it seemed. Shalisar lept a mighty leap  as the giant bowstring  sung.  A huge black iron tipped spear pierced  Shalisar in mid leap directly before Toadentrop's eye's.  A fine mist of blood  coated Toadentrop as Shalisar crumpled to the deck.  The blade in the wolf princes hand skiddered from his grasp to a stop at The Dwarf's feet.  Toadentrop rushed to the fallen prince. There in a pool of his own blood  the noble Prince Shalisar breathed his last  breath  in the arms  of the young dwarf.  Already So much death, death of friends and loved ones had visited Toadentrop, his tears left pale streaks on his blood painted face. Lady Mythrial  pulled the Body from Toadentrop's arms. Only then did  he turn his attention to the long silvery blade  on the deck..<br><br>It seemed as if all  eye's on the ship were on him. Toadentrop picked up the sword of souls. Looking up  he caught the proud look on Lady Esme's face. Strangely he felt numb as he strode to the rail and looked out at the Fury ship as it rolled over and sank smouldering into the chruning sea. The look of pride In Esme's eyes turned to shock as it did  in all the eyes  of those watching...  <br>Toadentrop strode right up to The Troll and pressed the hilt of the blade into  Zerkernaut's hand. "with this blade, no Orc or army of Orcs  could stand against you." <br><br>And  so it was that the most powerful weapon in the history of Norrath passed into the hands of a troll, the largest troll ever to stride.

EAST KARANA. Rolling landscape with a few hills, and trees with<br>branches going in only 4 directions. Animals scamper across the screen,<br>vanishing occasionally, only to re-appear a few feet further away moments<br>later. The sun is setting in the distance to the West, and the moon is<br>rising to the South. LOMBARD SETHERIAH, a Paladin, enters from the right.<br>He is clad in shining orange armor of Bronze and wielding a halberd, weapon<br>of the Paladin. Behind him strolls his faithful companion, DOBIN KINKLE,<br>wearing the finest in leather attire and wielding a large magical staff.<br><br>LOMBARD<br>Ahh, looks like a full moon!<br><br>DOBIN<br>Yes, just like last night. And the night before. And the night before.<br><br>LOMBARD<br>This new land is foreign to me, but I have been told it is cursed with<br>vile undead reavers which appear at dusk.

Friend Dobin, your tracking skills will be most useful now.<br><br>DOBIN<br>Very well, I shall attempt to find some.<br><br>Enter HARRYBALZ, a low level warrior decked out in light blue armor and<br>wielding a powerful looking axe.<br><br>HARRYBALZ<br>cn u give me sow?<br><br>LOMBARD looks the warrior up and down.

What beast is this?<br><br>HARRYBALZ suddenly runs past our heroes and down the bridge, behind him runs<br>a large bald CYCLOPS.

<center>Massive Postings from the Offical Gameplay Board</center><br><br><b>Question:</b> Anyway, is the Bard song Kellin's Lucid Lullaby ever intended to be fixed? It currently has a 3 second duration and a roughly 60% resist rate. Even those that are in favor of it the way it is admit that it requires a dedicated healer to keep the Bard alive while using it. One resist causes the monster to go berserk on the bard and instantly interrupt the song, and then the Bard is more or less dead because all the monsters are going to be un-mesmerized in three seconds <br><br>GZ has committed to doing further tests on Kellin's after he gets the expansion spells worked out. They must take priority at present. <br><br><b>Question:</b> Also, is it intended that Bards don't get any magical instruments until mid 30s or higher? If not, please examine the quests that give the unfound/missing instruments, they may be broken. <br><br>The amount that magical instruments can affect the outcome of a spell is limited, therefore the number of different levels of instruments that we can provide is likewise limited. So the answer to your question would be yes. <br><br><b>Question:</b> What use does minor illusion have on a non-pvp server where most mobs see right through it? (don't get me started on how sneaky and useful it is on a pvp server) <br><br>As a level 1 spell, it doesn't have much use on the non-pvp servers. As for PvP, it is indeed quite powerful. <br><br><b>Question:</b> Why doesn't the tree illusion give the same regen effect that tree form gives to druids? <br><br>Because it's not designed to. This one is an illusion of a tree, and the other actually turns the druid into a tree. <br><br><b>Question:</b> Enchanters get the instill mana line fairly recently and it has proven to be useless (with the exception of Wu's gauntlets). Are there any plans to add more items for the skills (in a gradual process) or will everything be added at one time? <br><br>This is more of a tradeskill issue. It's possible that we could see more items using the crystalize mana series when the Live team takes up trade skills again post-expansion. <br><br><b>Question:</b> This might be a question for GZ, but why don't enchanters get a level 49 illusion? Also, will enchanters get any illusions after level 50? <br><br>In order for an illusion to be possible, the character model to be illusioned must be in every zone that the illusion is capable in. Basically, we ran out of cool things to do with illusions. As for post-50, sorry, can't answer that yet. <br><br><b>Question:</b> Is it a bug or a feature that hybrids get less mana per wis/int from wis/int items than they do from their base wis/int? <br><br>Hybrids indeed use different formulae to determine their mana. This is as designed. <br><br><b>Question:</b> Also, why is it that hybrids get less mana than stated from mana items? ( i.e., 0-10 mana from a +25 mana item) <br><br>This shouldn't be the case. +mana is +mana. If anyone else can confirm this I'll be happy to chat with the programmers about it. <br><br><b>Question:</b> Are the mage spells posted on castersrealm and the like really real? Or are they just some joke like the early April fools thing. (I've heard the answer about not believing <br>that stuff but I want to know if its truth. <br><br>Can't answer anything about post-50 spells. Sorry. <br><br><b>Question:</b> Are there any plans to change the mage's phantom armor line so it's useful? <br><br>Actually yes. In order to make this series more useful, we're adding a regen component to the spells. +1 for leather, +2 for chain, and +3 for plate. <br><br><b>Question:</b> A Rogue cannot evade when the only other thing attacking the creature is a pet. Is this intentional? Why isn't the creature considering the pet a valid target to attack if a Rogue evades? <br><br> **I'm not positive, but I think the skill was intended to work in a group situation, and that we assume there are other characters attacking the target. <br>This is indeed true. Evade works by lowering the amount that a creature hates the rogue. If it is successful, it always lowers it to the same amount. When the damage is being done by a pet, it works out a little differently, therefore we assume that there's another valid PC for a target. <br><br><b>Question:</b> Any plans on adding an NPC that can reduce the weight of shadow Knight Quest Armor? It seems that this armor was designed with only Troll and Ogre Sk's in mind. <br><br>I've brought this up. I don't like it and think that we need to take into account the smaller races. I'll bring it up again. <br><br><b>Question:</b> Will there EVER be a "/who guild <guild name>" to list all the members of a guild currently online (and displaying tags)? I think this would be a great tool for guild leaders and officers for organizing events. Heck, you may already have something similar implemented. If this is the case, please excuse this waste of time <br><br>**You can already get the listing for some guilds by using /who all <first word in guildname>. Obviously, this method is sub-optimal and doesn't always work. Adding better who/guild functionality is on the programming list of things to do. <br><br>One additional note on this: For maximum success, enclose the guild name in quotes. <br><br><b>Question:</b> Could you add a /broken command to enhance the current /bug command? This new option would allow people to "report" and EverQuest to "compile" broken quests ...(like the assassin in Qeynos not dropping [black wood chips] broken since beta)... and cosmetic stuff like typos without the information being hidden in bug reports.<br><br> **We have an email address (which escapes me at the moment - doh!) that we'd prefer players use to report problems with quests. Abashi, if you're reading this, please re-post the quest help email addy. <br><br>Actually the questhelp address has been retired. Please refer quest-bugs to eqtesting@verant.com. <br><br><b>Question:</b> Planes armor is all no drop lore, however in Fear the Shaman and Cleric belt are just lore and droppable, why do you allow armor or weapons droppable at all from the planes? <br><br>Shouldn't be. I'm not that familiar with items in fear, are the two belts you are speaking of the Flayed Turmoilskin and the girdle of the diligent? <br><br><b>Question:</b> In all seriousness.. I don't know how specific this question is. but are dark elf clerics ever going to get any race and class specific quests? <br><br>There are a few race/class combos that could use some quests. Druids and Gnomes come to mind as well as DE clerics. We add quests all of the time, so it's possible that a few might show up from time to time, but there's currently no driven effort to add them. Perhaps there should be. <br><br><b>Question:</b> Some time ago, you mentioned that you were going to try to get a "history" put together for player consumption. It would be nice to have that for "fitting into" the world we are supposed to be role-playing in. Any status? <br><br>**Good question. I believe Abashi was supposed to be working on this - I'll ask him about it in the morning. <br><br>We're still working on this project. The guy who does our web sites is working on a layout that would fit the type of information we are planning on releasing. I hope to see the first tidbit released soon.

It has come to my attention that many children have been neglected by their<br>parents since the dawn of the EQ era, so I have taken it upon myself to<br>replace some of the conventional wisdom that may have been causing so many<br>tender minds to be snubbed in the past. Below are a few suggestions that I<br>have chosen to share with those of you who have children, but find that when<br>you are busy camping for your Ykesha or beating down the doors of Nagafen,<br>you just can't find time to aid the child in coming to grasps with the world<br>around them. I have detailed in this document the secrets to discarding the<br>world, and replacing it with the things most important in all our lives... <br><br>Problem: Child is curious why the sky is blue. <br><br>Solution: Inform the child that it isn't actually blue. It is made up of a<br>number of different hues that you have been able to maintain in the sky<br>because of your great video card and you have it set for double layer so<br>that it looks like clouds move independently. <br><br>Problem: Grandmother dies and child is bereaved. <br><br>Solution: Remind child that Grandma will be back. She just returned to her<br>bind point, and is likely to be back to loot her body any minute. Make sure<br>that you ask child if he would like to help Grandma get her exp back before<br>bed time as well; that generally makes the child feel wanted. <br><br>Problem: Child accidentally drops his gerbil off third floor of your house<br>after hearing that they were related to the feline family and watches with<br>dismay as the animal splatters thirty feet below. <br><br>Solution: Congratulate the child and remind it what incredibly good<br>experience gerbils are at that level. Recommend moving up to another mob<br>soon though, because gerbils will be turning green soon. <br><br>Problem: Child is horrified by water and he refuses to go to swimming<br>lessons you have arranged for him. <br><br>Solution: Comfort the child and remind him that many of his best items are<br>underwater. Assure him that there is nothing to be afraid of since he can<br>get a fishbone earring with a little patience, and he will certainly need<br>the swimming speed he can develop with his trainer before he can put that<br>earring to any real use. <br><br>Problem: Child has acted out in class and has been put into detention for<br>his actions. <br><br>Solution: Be assuring to the child and suggest that he practice his little<br>used skills while in detention. 2 hours should be more than enough time to<br>bring those troublesome trade skills into line. Be sure to provide the child<br>with some money to purchase any additional equipment that he may need to<br>pick up while practicing. <br><br>Problem: Child has difficulty in math and appears to be unlikely to pass the<br>class. <br><br>Solution: Start using mob base levels in the child's teachings. When<br>multiplying 2 x 50, refer to it as Fire Beetle x Zazamoukh and when the<br>child replies Excellent as the answer to the question, you have reached your<br>goal. The child has become better at Math (100)! <br>Problem: The child is going to a career day and is curious what path would<br>be best to get information on. <br><br>Solution: Suggest that the child avoid any careers that currently pay well.<br><br>Programmers, lawyers, doctors, network administrators, and politicians are<br>likely to get their salaries nerfed when the next patch comes out, so<br>instead encourage such engagements as brick layer, bus boy, musician, and<br>artist. All of these should be boosted considerably in the future for<br>balance. <br><br>Problem: Child is busted for fighting on school property and you are<br>contacted to pick the child up. <br><br>Solution: Reprimand the child strongly. Remind the child that if mobs are<br>aloud to escape they will come back and cause trains. Instead suggest that<br>next time the child should Snare the mob, kill it, and try to avoid letting<br>it seek help. With those types of tactics the child should be far more<br>likely to level quickly. <br><br>Problem: You discover child has been stealing from you. <br><br>Solution: Do not get angry. Try to push the child into a different center of<br>focus. Rogues are a weak class, but you can't tell a rogue to quit. Have the<br>child try killing a few things. Buff it a few times to see if it likes the<br>augmentation role. After a few short rounds of trying any other class, the<br>child is sure change its behavior immediately. <br><br>Problem: Child has killed its substitute teacher with a pencil. <br>Solution: Hire excellent lawyer to defend child from Juve under the argument<br>that it was a rare spawn and should at least be killed once to see what it<br>carries. <br><br>Problem: Child is found drinking with friends after school in your back<br>yard. <br><br>Solution: Purchase more alcohol and join them. You never know when a high<br>alcohol tolerance is going to be useful. Encourage the child and his friends<br>to drink liberally and quickly so as to see their skills rise quicker. If<br>your child has brought home an attractive teenage girl in his batch of<br>friends, make sure to encourage her to drink more than the rest and begin a<br>private tell conversation as soon as you have aided her in getting to her<br>skill cap. <br><br>Problem: Child has disappeared and you can't find its equipment. <br>Solution: Make a new child that looks just like it. Look back with fond<br>remembrance, but keep in mind, it was just one child and doesn't really<br>matter in the whole scheme of things since you can have up to 8 on your<br>account. Make sure the next one you make is a different class. <br><br>*** DISCLAIMER *** <br><br>I am not a parent currently, but I am however friends with a few parents who<br>have found this advice sound. If you choose to use any of the above methods<br>of child rearing, be wary that it does tend to cause detachment, painful<br>urination, law suits, back aches, sterility, and heavy blood loss in some<br>specimens. Check with your psychiatrist before taking any action described<br>above. If you do however find that these work for you, be sure to tell two<br>friends! <br><br>Carnuss Dire <br>Level 50 49 50 49 50 49 50 49 50 49 50 49 50 49 50 49 50 49 50 49 50 49 50<br>49 50 49 50 49 50 49 50 49 50 49 50 49 50 49 50 49 50 49 50 49 50 49 50 49<br>50 49 50 49 50 49 shaman.

<P>
Most of you EQ players are still in denial on this one topic. Even I have <br>told people that its only game yet I can sit and play it for a day straight <br>and not even have the time and no sleep phase me. I have finally had to have <br>my friends take my game and hid it from me. I have finally come back to <br>reality and now can honestly say that this game is like tobacco, once you <br>start the only way to stop is will power and cold chicken. Friends of mine <br>thought they could take the game and play it for a few minutes and not be <br>hooked but once they got into the game and looked around at the world and <br>people around them they completely freaked and ran to stores to grab this <br>game off the shelf. Within about two hours the friends that just got their <br>first experience in the EQ world were calling me up to know which server I <br>was on and what race I was and where I was.<br><br>Now we all knew that this game was going to be no different then any other <br>competitive multi-player game out there. Even with its down times for <br>servers people are still on all the time. Since its release I have never <br>seen any of the servers ever go below a thousand people on ever! Yes in some <br>areas you may be saying, "Ok, what is he on," but this is true. There are <br>players from all over the world right now as you read this sitting at their <br>house, their work station, a friends house, and even now sitting in their <br>lap as they are flying or driving. With the tons of different players, <br>races, and languages out there players have adapted to the game and have <br>been able to keep in contact with others no matter the difference.<br><br>With players having so much freedom to choose their own race and skills and <br>look some players have transported themselves into the game and have begun <br>to live in a new place that they now call home. With the races now getting <br>some additions players will now be able to start a brand new life as a new <br>personality and new life style as they embark once again into the EQ world. <br>I for one became so addicted that I would begin to say "Hail" and other <br>common words said in the game. My friends started to call me weird because I <br>would start to write Hawkril as my name and would write my class section as <br>Paladin of the Sun! If I hadn't taken about 4 weeks to come back to normal <br>and get my life back on track I think I might have become the game. I would <br>like to stress big time that this is only a game and that people should <br>treat it like one not become it like I did only a few months earlier.<br><br>If you ever feel that you are not an addictive player and that you have <br>control over your will power, the next time you sit down to play time <br>yourself and see how long you have been on. Here is a chart to see what kind <br>of player you are:<br><br>1 to 2 hours-Hidden player, has many other things on their mind. Has control <br>over themselves and their game life.<br>3 to 8 hours-General Player, Is one mostly ever day and usually knows a lot <br>about it. Still has control over themselves but is hanging on.<br>9 to - hours-Addicted! If you don't stop playing so long you may get to into <br>the game and have a break down or heart attack when other start talking <br>about reality and real things instead of EQ items and lore.<br><br>If you fit into the last one you guys better seek some help soon and after <br>that try and take a week off and try some sports like Baseball and Football. <br>If you think that this game is not an addictive game then you better think <br>again. This game is one of the most addictive games out on shelves. If you <br>don't think your addictive or this game isn't then you are probably going to <br>be one of the many people who end up living in the world of EQ longer then <br>you do in reality.<br><br>Hawkril

CHAPTER 1<br><br>	Seron Sleighhill stepped onto the docks in Freeport, followed by his wife, Jeyna.  In Jeyna&#8217;s arms was the couple&#8217;s infant son, Darien.   Seron was a warrior hailing from the Wood Elf City of Kaladim, while Jeyna was a cleric trained in the High Elf City of Felwithe.  Seron gazed at the setting sun and smelled the salty air of Freeport.   Young Darien stirred in his mother&#8217;s arms and showed signs of waking up.   Lovingly,  Jeyna slowly swayed her son back and forth in her arms while humming a comforting tune.   Seron put an arm around his wife&#8217;s shoulders and gazed into the city of Freeport,  a city bustling with activity and alive with action.   Jeyna looked into the brown eyes of her wood elven husband, and saw the fiery spirit of a warrior.  This concerned Jeyna deeply.<br><br>&#8220;Seron,  perhaps this was not such a good idea to bring young Darien here.    I mean,  you know about the dark side of this city.  It is not safe here for a child.  Why not raise him within the safe confines of Felwithe?&#8221;<br><br>Seron turned to face his wife and looked deep into her clear blue eyes.   <br><br>&#8220;Nonsense, my dear.   Darien will have the strength of his father, and the wisdom and intelligence of his mother.  He will be a great warrior someday, and perhaps,  will lead a great assault on the Teir&#8217;dal and finish them once and for all!&#8221;<br><br>Seron turned his focus onto his infant son.   Darien continued to sleep in his mother&#8217;s arms,  his dark brown eyes closed and his brown hair swaying ever so slightly in the wind.   &#8220;This boy is strong&#8221;  he thought.   &#8220;I knew it the instant he was born.  There is something very special about him.&#8221;<br><br>Jeyna knew that somewhere nearby,  the forces are darkness were watching them,  stalking them,  even as they stood on the pier.   She didn&#8217;t really understand why her husband desired to bring her infant son to such a place.   They would be much safer back home in Felwithe,  with the Elven Guards to protect them against any danger.<br><br>&#8220;My dear,  after you deal with the customs paperwork,  take Darien to our new home in North Freeport.   I must go meet with my old friend Barnabus now.    I will be back later tonight.&#8221;  said Seron.<br><br>&#8220;Alright.  Be careful Seron.&#8221;  said a concerned Jeyna<br><br>After giving his wife and son a goodbye kiss,   Seron entered the city of Freeport.<br><br>	Seron walked through the doors of Tassel&#8217;s Tavern and saw Barnabus sitting alone at the bar,  slowly sipping an ale.   Barnabus was a dwarf of incredible strength, with a long brown beard and a scar, which ran along the left eye.   It was not unusual to see Barnabus with a drink in his hand, although the fellow never seemed to be drunk.   That dwarf could hold his alcohol!  Seron approached the dwarf and greeted him with a hearty handshake.<br><br>&#8220;Seron!  M&#8217;boy!   It has been too long!&#8221;  exclaimed Barnabus  &#8220;How are the wife and child?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;They are well,  old friend.&#8221;  answered Seron.  &#8220;And how are you?   Plenty of wine and women,  and usual?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Ah,  my friend.  I am getting much too old for that sort of behaviour&#8230;.  Although I do enjoy a good wine now and then.&#8221;  laughed Barnabus.  &#8220;So,  what brings you to Freeport?  Tis not the safest place for young Darien to be,  my friend.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Alas,  Jeyna has already voiced that concern.  But I believe that training in Freeport will make young Darien stronger in the long run.   When he gets a little older&#8230; I will take him to West Freeport to hunt.&#8221;  said  Seron.<br><br>&#8220;Why not train him over on the Faydwer Continent?   I hear the fight against the Crushbone Orcs is going well.&#8221;  countered Barnabus.<br><br>&#8220;I could do that.  But I want Darien to look into the eyes of the true evil.  I want him to confront the Teir&#8217;dal.   I want him to look into the eyes of the sons and daughters of Innoruuk and know that such evil does exist in Norrath.   He must understand that the Dark Elves really do exist, and are not just evil characters in children&#8217;s stories.&#8221;  <br><br>&#8220;Aye,  I can understand that,  my friend.  Speaking of the Teir&#8217;dal,   there have been reports of them terrorizing the inhabitants of East Commons.&#8221;  said Barnabus.  &#8220;They usually attack at night,  and I was going over to East Commons myself to see if the reports are true.  Would you like to come with me?  It will be just like old times.&#8221;<br><br>Seron looked deep into the eyes of his old friend.    Age did not dim the old dwarven warrior&#8217;s fighting spirit.   That much was evident to Seron.    However,  Seron wondered if Barnabus was still physically able to confront the Dark Elves.<br><br>&#8220;Barnabus,  you should leave the fighting to the next generation,  my friend.  You have done more than your share of fighting in your day.&#8221;  voiced a concerned Seron.<br><br>Barnabus laughed a hearty dwarven laugh.<br><br>&#8220;Nonsense!    I have plenty of fighting days ahead of me!   Any Teir&#8217;dal that dares confront me will taste the steel of my blade!   Just as their fathers before them did.  <br><br>Seron shook his head.  There was no extinguishing Barnabus&#8217; fighting spirit.   <br><br>&#8220;Alright,  I will come with you.   It will be just like old times,  my friend.&#8221;  said Seron.<br><br>Barnabus roared with laughter.  &#8220;That&#8217;s the spirit M&#8217;boy!   Come!  Let us have one more drink, and we will be off!&#8221;  <br><br>Seron opened his backpack as Barnabus drank, and equipped his sword and shield.<br><br>	Jeyna Sleighhill sat in her chair and stared out of her window.   Night had begun to settle on the human city of Freeport,  yet the city continued to bustle with activity.   The house, which the Sleighhills had bought with their hard-earned platinum, was small, but comfortable.     In the distance,   Jeyna could see the Temple of Mithaniel Marr in all of its majesty.    Jeyna began to shiver,  it would be a cold night tonight.   She got up and placed another log on the crackling fire.    Seated near the warm fire was the Sleighhill&#8217;s infant son, Darien.    Darien had just been fed, and was quite content to sit and stare at the fireplace.    Jeyna glanced out the window once more and wondered where her husband was.   Deep down inside,  Jeyna knew exactly where he was.     He was with Barnabus,  off seeking another adventure.    It would not be the first time that Seron&#8217;s fiery warrior spirit overrode his parental and family duties.   Jeyna sighed.<br><br>&#8220;Oh Darien,  why does you father insist on keeping us up all night worrying about him?&#8221;  Jeyna asked her infant son.<br><br>Darien replied merely by staring curiously at his mother.      Jeyna returned to her seat and continued to stare out the window.<br><br>As their glistening armour shined in the pale moonlight,  Seron Sleighhill and Barnabus walked quietly along the path in East Commons towards Nektulos forest and the city of Neriak.  According to the rumours that Barnabus had heard,  the attacks were occurring in the hills region of East Commons,  near the passage to Nektulos.   In the distance,  Seron could hear the chatter of numerous fire beetles and the flapping wings of a large Griffin.    Seron scanned the hills for any type of movement, and saw none.   However,  he could feel an evil presence nearby.   <br><br>&#8220;They are out there somewhere.  I can feel it.&#8221;  commented Seron<br><br>&#8220;Aye.  I know.&#8221;   replied  Barnabus.   &#8220;Keep your eyes and ears open.  It will soon be time.&#8221;<br><br>	They stalked their prey as quietly as possible.    Aided by invisibility magic,   Tralon and Aerual D&#8217;eewlay carefully monitored the dwarf and elf duel that had wandered carelessly into their commonlands.   Along with the couple was their five-year-old son,  Blair.    Tralon and Aerual were extremely pleased with their son.  At five years of age,  young Blair had already mastered several first rank necromancer spells.   For the first time in his life,  Blair saw the enemy.    Tralon and Aerual motioned for their son to keep quiet,  as they organized their bone chips.    Quietly,  under the cover of darkness,  the necromancer couple began to summon a pair of skeletal warriors.<br><br>	Seron Sleighhill thought he saw motion out of the corner of his eye.   He stopped dead in his tracks.<br><br>&#8220;What is it?   Do you see something?&#8221;  asked Barnabus.<br><br>&#8220;Maybe.    I do not know&#8230;.&#8221;  replied Seron.     <br><br>Seron drew his sword and walked slowly in the direction in which he saw something move.   Suddenly,   a pair of skeletal hands grabbed Seron&#8217;s ankles from below.<br><br>&#8220;Seron!  Look out!&#8221;   cried Barnabus.<br><br>Barnabus ran to his friend,   only to be hit by a blast of poison magic.    Barnabus flew fifteen feet in the air and landed in a nearby bush.    From the shadows,  emerged Tralon and Aerual D&#8217;eewlay.    Barnabus slowly rose to his feet and withdrew his sledgehammer.  Seron remained rooted to the ground by the necromancer couple&#8217;s undead minion.   <br><br>&#8220;Look at what we have here,  my dear.   Wood Elf filth and a dwarven D&#8217;raakhatal.&#8221;  said Tralon D&#8217;eewlay.  <br><br>&#8220;Dark Elf slime,   why don&#8217;t you speak common and say that again?&#8221;   challenged Barnabus.   The fact that the dwarf was called a name that he didn&#8217;t understand enraged him.<br><br>&#8220;Oh,  my short, and soon to be deceased friend&#8230;   we will speak common if it makes your inevitable death more comfortable for you,  if you wish.&#8221;  replied Aerual.   <br><br>In the hills,  a safe distance away,   young Blair D&#8217;eewlay watched the encounter.<br><br>&#8220;You two are the ones who will soon die.&#8221;   said Seron,  who was still rooted to the ground.<br><br>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221;  replied Tralon.   Without warning,  a second skeleton emerged from the soil next to Tralon.   Tralon simply pointed to Seron.   With a hideous cackle,  the skeletal warrior began to pummel Seron.   <br><br>&#8220;Seron!&#8221;  cried Barnabus.    Barnabus ran to engage the skeleton.  He brought his sledgehammer down on the skeleton&#8217;s arm and shattered it with one blow.    Aerual raised her hand and the skeleton that had a grasp on Seron&#8217;s ankles released him.   Seron dropped to the ground a bloody mess.   He struggled to get back to his feet.   With one arm remaining,  Tralon&#8217;s skeletal pet returned to him.   The skeleton that had a hold on Seron&#8217;s ankles rose from the soil and took his place next to Aerual.   <br><br>&#8220;As you can see,  my foolish friends.  You cannot defeat the Teir&#8217;dal.  It is foolish to even try to oppose the sons and daughters of Innoruuk.&#8221;  said Aerual.   &#8220;Blair.   Blair.  Come here,  my son.&#8221;<br><br>From the shadows emerged young Blair D&#8217;eewlay,  his red eyes focused directly on his foes.  <br><br>&#8220;Now Blair,  just as we practiced.&#8221;  said Tralon D&#8217;eewlay.<br><br>With a single nod,   Blair began to cast a spell on Seron Sleighhill.   Seron gasped for air,  as he could feel the life being drained from his body.    <br><br>&#8220;Stop it!&#8221;  screamed Barnabus.     Barnabus charged at Blair.   Calmly,  Aerual D&#8217;eewlay began to chant her own mystic words.   Suddenly,  Barnabus felt as if two Sand Giants had wrapped themselves around his ankles.    He could now barely move.<br><br>&#8220;My dwarven friend.   How dare you try to deprive my son of the pleasure of his very first kill.&#8221;   said Tralon.<br><br>Barnabus felt very cold.   He could not move.   There was not much that he could do,  except to watch his friend Seron die,  and to await death himself.     Young Blair continued to cast on Seron,  slowly draining away his life.   Finally,  Seron&#8217;s lifeless body collapsed to the ground.   <br><br>&#8220;No!!!!!!&#8221;   cried Barnabus.<br><br>&#8220;Worry not,  my short friend.  You will be joining your friend shortly.&#8221;   said Aerual.<br><br>Mana pulsed through the veins of Tralon and Aerual D&#8217;eewlay.    Barnabus could see a pale green aura surround the necromancer couple.   Suddenly,  Barnabus felt very hot.   He looked at his hands,  and he could see his skin boiling.   Barnabus broke into a heavy sweat and dropped to his knees.  He could not run,  he could not hide.  All he could do is await death.  <br><br>&#8220;What is going on out there!&#8221;  came a voice from the distance<br><br>Tralon turned in the direction of the voice and saw its source.   It was Innkeep Harold. Tralon cursed in his dark language.<br><br>&#8220;Harold!   Bah!   Blair.  Time to go.&#8221;  said Tralon.<br><br>&#8220;But Father.  He is not dead yet.&#8221;   complained Blair.<br><br>&#8220;Do not argue with your father!&#8221;  said Aerual.    &#8220;It is time to go.  NOW.&#8221;  <br><br>With that,  the three Dark Elves disappeared into the shadows in the direction of Neriak.   Barnabus struggled to his feet and watched them melt away into the shadows.   Barnabus moved slowly to his fallen friend.  He checked his pulse,  there was none.   <br><br>&#8220;Are you all right?&#8221;  asked Innkeep Harold.<br><br>Barnabus did not reply.   Instead,  he picked up the body of his fallen friend and began to make his way back to Freeport.   &#8220;How was he going to explain this to Jeyna Sleighhill?&#8221;  he wondered.   Darien Sleighhill no longer had a father.<br><br>End of Chapter 1<br><br>Send Comments to kma@julian.uwo.ca for any suggestions,  comments, etc.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<P>
Ziff ripped the quiram root from the ground with his knife. He had spent the better part of the day looking for it, and he was pleased with the abundant growth of it here. Quiram was a necessary component for the Charm spell, and if he wanted to practice the new spell, he needed as much quiram as he could find.<br><br>If Ziff&#8217;s three years at the Enchantment College had taught him one thing, it was clearly that spell casting wasn&#8217;t cheap. The College provided a minimum amount of components for student use, but these were only applicable to the more mundane spells; light, enchant iron, minor illusion. While these spells prepared the student for immediate productivity in the market, they failed to push the learner into the higher, more esoteric realms of study. <br><br>Ziff wanted to learn more complex enchantments, and good teachers were readily available. But reagents were expensive and hard to come by. These he would have to find on his own. Most vendors in Erudin had ample supplies of even the most exotic reagents, but they were universally priced beyond his meager means. <br><br>Ziff leaned back on his heels and looked around. The Toxxulia forest was always dark and misty, a dreary collection of moss covered oaks, pine, and birch trees. He never liked it, preferring the clean streets and alleys of his home city, Erudin. There was some element of danger in the forest, for it was well known that kobolds still lived and roamed the area. However, Ziff had only traveled a mile or so from the city gates, and the city guard occasionally patrolled the region, so the risk was very small.<br><br>Ziff stood and stretched. He had gathered nearly a pound of the root, enough for him to test his new Charm spells on some of the student volunteers. He grinned. Maybe he could get the new apprentice to volunteer. By the gods, she was attractive! <br><br>Ziff was just about to stoop to his work again, when a soft rustle made him pause. A small chill shot through him. <br><br>Kobolds! he thought. <br><br>He stood unmoving, waiting. Another rustle, this time closer and louder, accompanied by a strange crackling noise he did not recognize, came from just a few yards to his left. The forest growth here was particularly thick and prevented Ziff from getting a clear view more than four feet in any direction. But as much as it hindered Ziff&#8217;s view, it also protected him from prying eyes. Whoever or whatever was moving around out there was as unlikely to see Ziff as Ziff was to see it.<br><br>Curiosity got the better part of Ziff. <br><br>Probably just a patrol, he thought. Crouching, he eased forward for a better look.<br><br>Ziff crawled forward only a dozen yards and was carefully pulling a branch out of his face when a sharp report like boards cracking exploded in his ears. <br><br>Ziff froze. The last sound had come only inches from his face. Carefully, he pulled the last branch from his face.<br><br>Standing no more that a foot from his position was a skeleton. Ziff&#8217;s blood froze and his heart began to hammer in his chest. <br><br>Undead!  he thought. In Toxxulia! ON ERUD! <br><br>Undead had not wandered freely in the forests since the destruction of the Heretics centuries ago. The very presence of this creature, here, now, had thunderous consequences. <br><br>His masters would have marveled at his insightful analysis if any of these thoughts had entered Ziff&#8217;s mind. Instead, Ziff worked overtime to combat the fear and revulsion coursing through his mind and body while trying not to faint.<br><br>He knew he had to get away and report this to the guards, his elders, anybody. With care, Ziff slowly began retreating the way he had come.<br><br>Oddly, the monster did not seem to have any set purpose. It stood there, mute and motionless, gazing into some unknown past through its empty sockets. Its stillness relaxed Ziff somewhat helping bring his heart under control. It also lowered his awareness. Ziff slipped on a small log in the underbrush, and, with a gasp, flopped backward onto his rump. <br><br>The skeleton reacted instantly. With a soul shrinking scream, all the more ghastly given it absence of lungs, throat and lips, it leapt at Ziff. Screaming himself, Ziff rolled violently to his right, crashing through the underbrush. His robe ripped and branches stabbed his body as he scrambled to his feet. The monster followed, its stickly body snagging on creepers and growth. <br><br>Ziff was no warrior. His dagger was for chopping roots, and his magical studies were geared more for &#8220;practical magic&#8221; such as decorative illusions and enchanting farmer&#8217;s tools. The only dangerous spell he knew was for choking rats. Its value was immeasurable for clearing the warehouse and kitchens of pets. What good it would do him now was anyone&#8217;s guess, but it was all he had.<br><br>&#8220;Allikoch&#8221; he yelled. Ziff felt the magic rise in him as he strove to impose his will over the magic forces in the world. A slight orange nimbus enshrouded the skeleton, and amazingly, it staggered for just a second. How a lifeless being could be choked briefly broke Ziff&#8217;s concentration, but he pushed the thought aside for the more urgent imperative of survival. The creature was nearly free of brambles and already reaching for him. The surrounding vegetation was too thick for a quick escape, so the &#8220;flight&#8221; half of his options was gone.  <br><br>&#8220;Allikoch&#8221; he yelled again, and again the nimbus radiated from the creature. It staggered again, but was still too lively for Ziff&#8217;s tastes. <br><br>The skeleton ripped free of the brush, staggered to its feet, and swiped at him with its rotten hand. <br><br>&#8220;Alli----&#8220; The spell died in his throat as the skeleton followed up with another attack, its left hand raking across Ziff&#8217;s cheek. The sudden pain made him gasp as his face seemed to catch fire. Blindly, he flailed with his right hand and cut off the skeleton&#8217;s left hand.<br><br>A second later, the creature&#8217;s right hand clubbed him in the temple, and Ziff crumpled to the ground. Nausea threatened to overtake him as he fell roughly to his back.<br><br>&#8220;Allikoch&#8221; he mumbled, and the skeleton fell to one knee, this time making an obscene noise that Ziff took to be gagging. Instantly it was up again, and Ziff knew he was going to die. It was all could do to keep from passing out; exhaustion, fear, and pain all fighting to take him down.<br><br>The skeleton loomed over him, a tree branch in its hand. Ziff looked up in detachment as the creature raised the makeshift cudgel. The log came down, and Ziff closed his eyes&#8230;<br><br>CRACK! <br><br>Ziff felt a weight smash into his stomach, and his eyes jerked open. The skeleton&#8217;s club lay on the ground, split neatly in two. Half of the club had settled near his legs, the other half had land squarely on his gut<br><br>His attacker was being sorely pressed by the arrival of a second skeleton. The creatures exchanged splintering blows but the second monster was clearly stronger, pushing, hitting, and head-butting the first one, driving it back and away from where Ziff lay sprawled.<br><br>With a final uppercut, the stronger creature crushed the first skeleton&#8217;s skull. Destroyed, it collapsed in a pile of splintered bones.<br><br>The second skeleton turned and advanced on Ziff. <br><br>&#8220;Out of the frying pan&#8230;&#8221; he mumbled, dizzy and exhausted. The irony of his fate wasn&#8217;t lost on him, and he gave a slight chuckle.<br><br>His laugh stopped as suddenly as it came when the skeleton reached the spot where he lay.  Ziff struggled up to one elbow, holding his dagger up. It was a poor defense, but Ziff was damned if he wasn&#8217;t going to at least try to go down fighting.<br><br>The skeleton just stood there.<br><br>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this where I came in?&#8221; Ziff thought.<br><br>&#8220;Well, what are you waiting for?&#8221; he yelled.<br><br>The creature didn&#8217;t budge. It seemed to have forgotten that Ziff was even there. <br><br>Ziff slowly, stiffly, rose to his feet. Dagger in front of him, he challenged the creature again.<br><br>&#8220;C&#8217;mon, you vile puke!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;Let&#8217;s finish it!&#8221;<br><br>A slight clearing of the throat from behind made Ziff whirl wildly. Standing directly behind him was a man who, but for his filthy brown robe, could have been his twin. Tall and lanky, high of brow like all Erudites, the man gazed casually upon the bruised enchanter, seemingly oblivious to his long dead companion. <br><br>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t call Garavab names, he doesn&#8217;t like it,&#8221; said the man.<br><br>Ziff fainted.<br><br>When Ziff came to, he was resting comfortably on a bed of moss and hides within a primitive hut. His body ached dully, but he was relieved to discover he had not been eaten.<br><br>The hut seemed hastily made, the walls a combination of hides, branches, and mud. The roof was thatch with a small hole in the center for venting the smoke from the small fire that burned in the center of the floor. <br><br>His eyes came to rest on the seated figure at the foot of his bed.<br><br>&#8220;Gorliss?!&#8221; he blurted, rising to a sitting position. Wooziness overcame him and he toppled back over.<br><br>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t do that if I were you,&#8221; said the seated man. &#8220;Besides taking a good beating, you also contracted a disease from your friend in the forest. It took me several hours to drive out the infection, but my methods, while effective, are still a little crude. Your body is bruised inside and out.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Gorliss&#8230;&#8221; Ziff breathed. &#8220;Gorliss&#8230;&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;You keep saying my name,&#8221; said Gorliss. &#8220;Please quit doing that, it&#8217;s annoying.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Where have you been for the last 4 years?&#8221; asked Ziff. &#8220;I came to see you one day, and you were just gone. No one could tell me when or where you had run off to. What are you doing here now? What happened to the skeleton? What&#8230;&#8221; <br><br>Gorliss held up his hand and cut Ziff short. He stared at Ziff as if from another world, but his voice spoke pleasantly. <br><br>&#8220;Do you remember what happened to me five years ago?&#8221; asked Gorliss.<br><br>Ziff looked away. He knew what Gorliss was referring to, and it was if it had only happened yesterday. <br><br>&#8220;Yes. We were returning from the market. You and Irina had gone to buy her a new dress for the wedding.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;What else?&#8221; prompted Gorliss.<br><br>&#8220;A dwarven caravan had arrived from Kalawherever-they-live. One of the drunken fools lost control of his wagon, and the horses bolted. Irina was crushed&#8230;&#8221;<br><br>Ziff could see the tragic scene: the toppled wagon, High Men and dwarves running wildly about, a young enchanter student screaming wildly, and on the ground, a dead, dead body.<br><br>Gorliss&#8217; eyes burned into Ziff. He winced away from the stare.<br><br>&#8220;Three days before our wedding,&#8221; Gorliss spat. &#8220;Three days to go, and there she was, dead. And what for? Because some dwarves got drunk? Because some horses were startled? These things happen everyday, and thousands survive. Irina, my Irina, was killed for no reason at all.&#8221;<br><br>Ziff kept his tongue. The intense emotions coming from Gorliss were nearly sufficating.<br> <br>&#8220;I remember,&#8221; whispered Ziff.<br><br>Ziff thought about the changes that had come over Gorliss following Irina&#8217;s death. Once one of his closest friends, Gorliss had become a walking spectre, haunted by the tragedy of his lost love. For months he had become withdrawn, listless, uninterested in any thing around him. Then suddenly, about 6 months before his had disappearance, he seemed to have reawakened. He still refused to socialize in any meaningful way, but students who studied with him remarked on his new intensity. His eyes were alight with passion, his movements and walk, determined. His masters at the College, relieved to see one of their best students back in form, privately celebrated his &#8220;triumphant&#8221; return. Then suddenly, he was gone.<br><br>Gorliss had lapsed into silence again, watching his old friend on the bed, but not really seeing him at all, lost in memory. Ziff spoke.<br><br>&#8220;Why did you leave? I knew you were depressed, but I thought you had come back to yourself.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t leave,&#8221; Gorliss said. &#8220;I was banished. If I ever return to Erudin, I will be put to death.&#8221;<br><br>Ziff stared wordlessly. He had never heard of such a thing in Erudin. They were a people of laws, of civilization. They were the High Men! Putting people to death was barbaric! And why would they kill Gorliss, once one of the best students in the Enchanter College?<br><br>&#8220;If you value your skin, you will never tell anyone that you saw me, much less spoke to me. No, don&#8217;t look that way at me. I will not kill you. The &#8220;city fathers&#8221; are whom you should fear.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;When Irina was killed, I thought I had lost everything,&#8221; continued Gorliss. &#8220;I only went to the Enchanter College for her. Personally, I always thought of being a magician or a paladin, but she wanted to be an enchanter. I wanted to spend my days close to her, so I followed her into the College. When she died, everything I had tried to be was killed with her. I was nothing. I had no direction, no plans, no future, and no channel for vengeance. I couldn&#8217;t kill the dwarves, we don&#8217;t allow such actions. I was wasted and had no answers. But then, something happened, something special&#8230;a miracle!&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I spent most of my days in the library. I wandered the aisles, half-heartedly keeping to my studies, randomly checking out the works of the &#8220;great masters.&#8221; Then one day, I found it! A book. A wondrous book! THE book! It explained everything! The miracle of life, death, and best of all, living beyond death!&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Knowing what I know now, I can&#8217;t believe that the book was delivered to me by accident. Those stodgy no-nothings in the Enchanter College would never allow this kind of knowledge to lay around untouched. Elitists! Bigots!&#8221;<br><br>Gorliss had worked himself up to a near yell, and Ziff grew a little afraid.<br> <br>&#8220;Regardless,&#8221; continued Gorliss, calming a little, &#8220;I began to learn so much more of life through my new source, I had no choice to experiment.&#8221; He paused, as if unsure what to say. &#8220;Ziff&#8230;I brought Irina back to life.&#8221;<br><br>Ziff gasped. No, he thought, he isn&#8217;t&#8230;he can&#8217;t&#8230;<br><br>&#8220;Not really alive in whole, but animated,&#8221; said Gorliss, wistfully. &#8220;But I had just started. With the book, I could do so much more! The hints, the half written theories, the documented successes! With better equipment and samples&#8230;&#8221;<br><br>Ziff was breathing heavily now&#8230;No! no!no!no!pleaseno!no!<br><br>&#8220;&#8230;not just animation, but actual life! Life after death! Just think&#8230;&#8221;<br><br>Don&#8217;t say it Don&#8217;t say it dontsayitdontsayitdontsayit<br><br>&#8220;&#8230;can defeat Death! I will be that man!&#8221; Gorliss shouted, rising to his feet. &#8220;I will not rest, not ever, until I have found You. Until I have put my hands upon Your throat and squeezed! I am coming for you Death, and I will crush you beneath my feet!&#8221;<br><br>Gorliss was wild now, screaming, his eyes blazing red (red!). A silver nimbus had grown around him, magic tendrils licking out.<br><br>Weak as he was, Ziff lurched to his feet and ran. His friend, mad with grief, banished from his own people, had gone insane. He had become the heretic, blasphemer, criminal, traitor, outcast, necromancer.<br><br>As he bolted from the hut, Ziff failed to notice the skeletal guard standing calmly outside. <br>

<P>
Part 1<br>    <br>    "Ye know, it's a wonder I haven't killed ye yet, ye senseless idiot."  Bulkroth spat the words irritably at his companion, who trudged along wearily ahead of him.  The other dwarf didn't bother to turn around, but the fairly audible grumbling that emanated from his short, stocky figure indicated that he was no more pleased with Bulkroth than Bulkroth was pleased with him.  <br><br>Taking his relative silence as an invitation to press even further, Bulkroth continues his assault.  "Take us straight to Kelethin."  He mocked, using his best imitation of Kragbarth's deep-throated voice.  "Damned elves.  If we ever actually get there, I'm throwing you straight off the edge."  Kragbarth refused to be nettled by the comment.  Reaching out in front of him, he grabbed a thick, springy branch that protruded out into the heavily overgrown "path" the two dwarves were slogging along.  This he held tightly onto for a few feet, until he himself was quite clear of it.  Then, without the <br>slightest twinge of remorse, he released the branch, sending it catapulting straight into Bulkroth's burly, armored chest.   An audible clang reverberated throughout the deep woods as the branch crashed into the dwarf's thick, metal breastplate, followed by an almost as audible thud as the dwarf crashed into the ground.  The resulting torrent of curses sent most of the birds within a half-mile radius soaring out of the trees for safety, and probably both alerted and scared off any enemy that had the misfortune of being in the same vicinity as the two dour dwarves.  Kragbarth didn't even turn his head back towards his unpleasant companion; the fiery, red-bearded <br>dwarf simply trudged on, leaving his muddy cousin sputtering on the forest floor.<br><br>    After several minutes of relative silence, Bulkroth managed to catch up with the leading dwarf, and fell in step with notably less complaint.  "Where do ye suppose we are?"  He asked gruffly, brushing aside some cobwebs from his ruddy forehead with the back of his mailed hand.  After a few seconds, Kragbarth responded.<br><br>    "Ye got me.  It's a big woods.  Not that we really got anything to worry about."  Bulkroth grumbled at this answer.<br><br>    "Aye, so long as we don't starve.  Can't eat these Brell-be-damned leaves."  The dwarf's stomach added it's own grumbling, accentuating his point.<br><br>    "Quit yer whining." Kragbarth responded sharply to the chorus of grumbles emanating from his companion. "I've got a good bag fulla fishcakes in the pack, bought 'em off that elf we saw yesterday."   Bulkroth shot him a filthy glance.<br><br>    "You know full well I hate fishcakes."  He kicked at a root with his thick, iron-shod boot.  "Besides, we saw that elf two days ago, not yesterday.  Fishcakes barely stay fresh fer two hours, let alone two days." Kragbarth still refrained from looking at his companion.<br><br>    "Then eat yer Brell-be-damned leaves, ye Brell-be-damned idiot."  The red-bearded dwarf swept aside a patch of briars, and trudged along a path that was no longer the slightest bit visible.  A few more minutes passed quietly, broken only by the grumbling of Bulkroth's stomach.  Eventually, Kragbarth felt a rough tap on his armored shoulder.  "Aye?"  He tossed the word over his back, not bothering to glance backwards.  Bulkroth spoke softly; his gruff voice was barely audible above the clumping of their heavy boots.<br><br>    "Can I have a fishcake, lad?"  Kragbarth's grim visage split with a slow smile.<br><br>    "Be my guest."  He responded, carefully controlling his voice.  "They're in yer pack.  I didn't wanna carry em, the things smell terrible!"<br><br>    The Mighty Faydark was deep in shadows well before the sun fully set, the great trees shutting out the last warm rays, and chilling those left outdoors to the bone, even though the sky was still tinged with color, and the breath of summer was still in the air.  Bulkroth stared up into that sky, watching the magnificent reds and oranges recede into a fading, deep purple through the leaves of the mighty trees.  Crickets and cicadas were beginning to awaken throughout the wood, filling the darkening Faydark with the chorus of nighttime in the summer.  The dwarf looked over at his companion across the small clearing, catching sight of the warm glow of fireflies flickering in <br>and out of the trees.  Kragbarth was leaning heavily against a thick tree trunk, draining a waterskin that smelled suspiciously like beer.  The red-bearded dwarf met his cousin's glance, and lowered the flask.  "Nice night, eh?"  He asked, the first words the two had spoken for some time.  Bulkroth turned his gaze back up into the sky.<br><br>    "Aye, that it is."  He responded, and paused a moment, pulling in a deep breath of evening air.  "Maybe we should camp right here, tonight.  We've walked a long way already, I think we earned it."  Kragbarth glanced around the clearing, weighing the matter in his mind.<br><br>    "Don't suppose we're likely to find a nicer spot tonight <br>anyways."  He responded.  "I'm good fer camp, so long as yer takin' first watch."  Bulkroth sighed heavily, tossing his pack upon the ground.<br><br>    "Aye, no problem."  He agreed, without removing his gaze from the deep sky.  "Go cook us some dinner."  Kragbarth set about gathering some small firewood.    <br><br>"Warm fishcakes?"  He asked, glancing over at his cousin.  Bulkroth <br>shrugged.  Kragbarth dumped the wood in the center of the clearing and dug into his pack.  Triumphantly, he dragged out a small, wrapped bundle.  Bulkroth looked over at the package with interest.  "Picked up something else off that elf, too."  Kragbarth tore open the carefully folded package with his dagger, and thrust his nose into the contents, sniffing sharply.  "Couple good slabs of wolf meat."  He held the package up for Bulkroth to see.  "The elf salted 'em, they're still good as ever.  I'll cook 'em up real nice for us.  I even got some beer stowed in one of those flasks."  He jerked his <br>thumb in the direction of the waterskins, spilling out of one of the packs.  Bulkroth smiled knowingly at the gesture.  Kragbarth grinned at his weary companion.  "Tonight we feast!"<br><br>    The sky was clear and cold, allowing the light of the pale moon to illuminate the thick treetops of the great forest.  Yet, on the ground, the heavy shadows of those same trees absorbed all celestial light, leaving it's inhabitants in a night as black as pitch, a darkness that they were all too used to.  Bulkroth huddled tighter into the worn blanket draped across his broad shoulders, absently hacking at a chunk of unused firewood with his dagger as he waited out his watch.  It was a cold night, even though September had only just begun to wane, and the dwarf was not the slightest bit surprised to see faint tendrils of his breath condense in the air before him, lightly dispersing in the cool, gentle breeze that wafted through the <br>wood.  <br><br>The night was quiet, although the insects still chirped and Kragbarth occasionally burst forth with an explosive snore.  Bulkroth lifted his dagger from the block of wood and picked at one of his teeth, scraping free a straggling piece of food.  Dinner had been excellent.  Although he hated to admit it to his face, Kragbarth was one hell of a cook.  Few people could turn a slab of wolf meat into a delicacy the way the fiery dwarf could.  In fact, he could cook nearly as well as Bulkroth could brew, given the proper facilities, of course, and that was no small feat.  Kragbarth had long ago <br>given up denying the fact that his cousin easily made the best beer he had ever tasted, realizing at last that by acknowledging his companion's skill, more beer was to be had.  Bulkroth smiled at the thought of his cousin's grudging compliments.  Yeah, when the two of them finally settled down with their own inn, no competition would even stand a chance.<br><br>    Bulkroth's eyes roved over to the still form of his cousin and companion.  Kragbarth's ruddy features were dimly illuminated in the dying light from the glowing embers of their cook fire, the fiery ashes accenting further the flame red beard that grew in a tangled mess from his strong jaw.  His dented breastplate gleamed slightly from beneath his ragged cloak and the equally ragged blanket he was wrapped in.  The shiny, three-horned helm that he wore with such pride rested directly next to his sleeping figure, right alongside <br>the mighty warhammer that was his heirloom, and weapon of choice.  Bulkroth's eyes rested on that hammer, and he subconsciously fingered the heavy battleaxe that lay across his thick knees.  Kragbarth's hammer was one of the most fearsome weapons he had ever seen.  <br><br>Although it seemed unimpressive lying cold and dark next to the sleeping warrior, Bulkroth had seen his cousin wield the mighty weapon in combat countless hundreds of times.  Every single one of those times, Bulkroth had not ceased to be impressed.  The thick steel head of the weapon was unadorned, save for a single, chiseled <br>rune blazoned along its left side.  When Kragbarth traced his finger through that rune, the hammer erupted with life, crackling with internal magics all its own.  It was a fearsome sight to see.  Not that Bulkroth's own axe was any less fearsome.  Certainly it was prettier to look at, the shining silvery steel seeming to glow with the barely visible rays of the white moon, and the soft, carefully laid grip caressing the rough palm that held it.  Yet, in truth, it was the wielder, rather than the weapon, that held the difference <br>in battle, as the two dwarves had found out many times over.  Both dwarves were easily worthy of their weapons, as countless enemies had found out, although often without the chance to do so many times over.  Thinking of this, Bulkroth smiled inwardly, easing his armored bulk back against a tree trunk, and fell to memories of the duo's fiercest battles.<br><br>    So wrapped up in his thoughts was he that Bulkroth missed the first signs of approaching danger almost until it was too late.  With a jerk of his head he pulled himself back to the present, and felt a tense shiver run down his spine.  Clambering to his feet, as silently as an armored dwarf can, he pricked his ears to his surroundings, quickly kicking out the last glowing embers of the campfire.  The insects had stopped chirping, the forest was dead silent, unnaturally silent.  Straining his ears, Bulkroth tried desperately to pick up a recognizable sound.  For several long seconds the dread silence echoed through the mighty Faydark, until finally Bulkroth's ears picked up what they were searching for.  A faint, rapid crunching <br>slithered through the dark trees.  Faint, yet increasing in volume every passing second.  The crunching was unmistakable; footsteps, running footsteps, a sound the dwarf had heard often enough.  Yet, with the rapidly approaching footsteps came a growing, chill sense of dread, a feeling that grew on the dwarf inexplicably, filling him with an uneasy fear that he could not explain.  Without looking down, Bulkroth kicked softly at his companion, arousing the sleeping dwarf, who was on his feet in a matter of seconds, balancing his hammer in one hand, rubbing sleep from his deep-set eyes with the other.  He looked at Bulkroth questioningly.<br><br>    "What is it?" He mouthed silently.  Bulkroth shrugged, both in answer to the inquiry and in an attempt to shake away the discomforting fear.  He glanced over at Kragbarth; by the uneasy look on his cousin's face, he was experiencing the same inexplicable feeling.  Bulkroth tightened is grip on his battleaxe, hoping to grind out the shaking in his hands.  Kragbarth reached down with fingers that trembled ever so slightly, snatched up his helm by one of the horns, and dropped it onto his head.  The footfalls were <br>clearly audible now.  Someone, or something, was crashing through the woods, headed straight in their direction.  The two dwarves crouched down amongst the shadows of the tree trunks, straining their eyes for a glimpse of this newcomer.<br><br>    They did not have to wait long.  Moments later, dark branches began to swing and small limbs cracked off, beaten down by a tall, ragged figure, racing blindly through the foliage at an incredible pace.  Just as the figure would have stepped into the dwarfs tiny clearing, one of its feet became entangled in some sparse underbrush, and the creature crashed to the ground with a groan, rolling into the clearing, in plain view of the hidden dwarves. <br><br> Bulkroth looked over at his cousin.  Kragbarth stood up.  The figure in the clearing was struggling to his feet.  Kragbarth caught sight of pointed ears, saw the flash of large, luminous eyes, set in a thin face.  As bloody and ragged as this figure was, it was unmistakably recognizable.  Kragbarth spoke one word to his concealed cousin.<br>   <br> "Elf."  At the sound of the voice, the elf swung around in the direction of the shadowed warrior.  Kragbarth found an arrow leveled at his throat.  He held up his hand, palm towards the newcomer.  "Hold, elf."  He spoke the elven tongue crudely, but the effect was astonishing.  The elf looked hard at him for a second more, then, turning aside his bow, he crumpled to the ground, panting heavily.  He looked in Kragbarth's direction.<br>    <br>"Run, dwarves."  He spoke the common tongue, and his words encompassed both Kragbarth and Bulkroth.  His sharp eyes had not missed the crouched dwarf.  Kragbarth stepped forward, extending a hand to the prone elf.<br>   <br> "From what, lad?  I'm not prone to running at just anything."  The dwarf hoisted the panting elf to his feet, supporting his slender form on his stocky shoulders.  His words were bold, but his eyes gave away the growing fear the two dwarves continued to experience, a fear that obviously grew upon the elf as well.  The elf looked at him strangely, a wild look in his large eyes.  Then his gaze trailed past the dwarf, staring into the woods, and his <br>eyes widened in terror.<br>   <br> "No!  Too late!"  The elf whispered these last words.  Kragbarth stared at him, not comprehending what was said.  Then he felt the hair rise on the back of his neck.  The elf continued to stare dumbly over his shoulder.  Bulkroth bellowed an earsplitting shout from his place amongst the tree trunks.<br>   <br> "DUCK!"  Kragbarth bowled himself over forwards, dragging the lanky elf down with him.  The air above his head sang as the shimmering, silvery blade sliced through the place where his head had been, only instants before.  He rolled onto his back, leveling his hammer, in an attempt to get a glimpse of his attacker.  What hovered before him froze his heart, and his rough face mirrored the terror-filled visage of the elf at his side.  As dark as the night was, the hellish figure confronting the prostrate dwarf was blacker, its torn, rotting black robes billowing out around it with a numbingly cold <br>wind that seemed to emanate from within.  The smell of rotting flesh filled Kragbarth's nostrils, yet his nose didn't even wrinkle, he simply stared into the ghastly visage of the monster before him.  The creature's face had long since decayed, leaving a dark, hideous skull, grinning like a tortured demon from the plane of fear.  The empty eye sockets glowed with an unholy light, and these endless depths held Kragbarth's eyes, froze him in dumb terror.  In it's bony, rotting hands it held a long, glimmering, vicious scythe, and <br>slowly it raised this weapon, preparing a blow that would slice the dwarf's head clean off his body.  Still, Kragbarth could only stare.  The scythe rose higher and higher, then stopped.  With a blood chilling, moaning laugh, the hellish creature brought down the wicked blade.  <br><br>It never made contact.  With a howl, Bulkroth hurled himself bodily at the unholy apparition, crashing into it with bone-cracking force, and disrupting the swing meant to behead his cousin.  The creature was swept to the ground underneath the armored dwarf, yet as they hit, it was Bulkroth who screamed, not the apparition. <br> <br>Yet, this was not an ordinary scream.  The bellow of agony that poured from Bulkroth's mouth was inhuman, filled with terror and pain, as if the dwarfs very soul were being pierced.  That scream shocked Kragbarth back to life.  Gritting his teeth, he dragged his stubby finger through the groove of the rune on his hammer, and swung the weapon high over his head.  The dark steel begin to glow sullenly, then with a crackle, explosive lightning erupted around it, coursing through the veins of both the metal and it's wielder. <br><br>Snarling, Kragbarth charged the apparition, which was now atop Bulkroth, it's fleshless hands wrapped tightly around the writhing dwarf's neck.  Kragbarth swung his crackling hammer, catching the demonic beast soundly in the torso area, sweeping it off of his companion, and giving Kragbarth the satisfaction of feeling bones splinter beneath the black robes.  Yet, the dwarf watched with a horrid fascination as the creature picked itself up, swinging it's <br>enormous scythe in a wide arc in his direction.  Cursing, Kragbarth fell back, his mind racing.  Bulkroth still lie writhing upon the ground, clutching at his throat.  His skin was all blue.  Kragbarth wiped cold sweat from his forehead, the scythe was huge, far too long to allow him to get close enough to score a hit without first being cut open by the shimmering blade.  The apparition advanced upon him very slowly, swinging the scythe in slow, lethal arcs, making the air sing with the sound of hissing metal.  Kragbarth's mind was blank.  He would have to charge this thing and pray to get a good shot off before the thing tore him apart.  Muttering a quick prayer to Brell under his breath, he cocked his warhammer, facing the hellish visage with the cool calm of a warrior who knows he's going to die.  The <br>rotting creature seemed to smile in anticipation.  Kragbarth swallowed a cold lump in his throat.  Then, at that very moment, a muffled "twang" sounded throughout the small clearing, followed by a soft "thwack."  The apparition reared back its ghastly, hooded head, and in less than a second, flames licked up its robe, swiftly transforming the creature into a demonic inferno.  With a hellish scream, it swung around, whipping the scythe in a murderous assault upon its attacker.  <br><br>The moment the creature turned, Kragbarth charged, and with every once of strength in his compact body, smote the head of the decaying monster with his blazing hammer.  The skull shattered beneath the blow, and energy coursed through the flaming apparitions ghastly body.  <br><br>The robes crumpled into a smoldering heap upon the ground, and the enormous scythe fell to the earth with a clatter.  Panting, Kragbarth looked up from the corpse.  There stood the ragged elf, bow in hand, staring at the guttering mass lying upon the ground at his feet.  From the back of the ungodly apparition protruded the charred shaft of an arrow.  Kragbarth muttered a quick thanks to whatever god was watching over him.  The elf continued to stare at the crumpled corpse with a blank expression on his thin face, although the apparition was obviously incapacitated, and the chill fear had lifted from the clearing with it's relative death.  Kragbarth opened his mouth to speak, but he was cut off by a low groan, feebly drifting from <br>Bulkroth's prone form.  Momentarily forgetting the elf, Kragbarth clumped over to his cousin's side, and dropped to his knees, shaking the unconscious dwarf gently.  Color was slowly returning to Bulkroth's face, and his eyes rolled slowly open.  <br><br>With a weak cough, Bulkroth managed to revive himself, hoisting himself up feebly upon one elbow, and looking at his companion with <br>a sickly triumphant expression.    "Boy lad, do you owe me one now!"  He wheezed the words, but they were clearly audible.  Kragbarth looked down at him, and was silent for a few moments.  Bulkroth waited patiently, a weak smirk upon his pale face.  <br><br>Kragbarth patted him roughly on the shoulder.<br><br>    "Aye, next round's on me."<br>                                    -end, part 1-<br><br>-Hope you enjoyed it!

<P>
<center><i>Massive Postings from the Official Gameplay Board</i></center><br><br>Here's my final bunch of Q&As for the evening. Thanks very much everyone for not only providing me with a TON of questions to answer, but also for keeping the flames to a minimum.<br>I really hope all of this has been helpful to many of you. Also, let us know if we should compile all of this into a gameplay FAQ or some such, thanks.<br><br>Lastly, I apologize to anyone who posed questions today that I missed or was unable to answer, for whatever reason.<br><br>Anyway, here goes:<br><br>---<br><br>Brad, being a longtime RPGer yourself, do you REALLY believe that understanding the basics of stats (not even exact formulas) reduce the appeal and longevity of an RPG? I understand you don't want players to concentrate on the numbers, but this "wall of silence" regarding even general questions is taking things too far.<br><br>**Yes, I really do think that. When I played AD&D the DM tried very hard to keep us from hard numbers and such, opting instead to try to create a more immersive experience. And it worked.<br><br>Thought you were going to OSI. When will that happen and who will carry on the Vision?<br><br>**That was an April Fools joke put on by one of the websites I think. I am extremely happy at Verant and plan on staying here for a very long time.<br><br>Are you ever going to embrace Open GL?<br><br>**We already are with our newer engines (Sovereign, for example). Back when we were working on the EQ engine, though, it just didn't make sense - Glide and D3D covered all the bases. That's still true to an extent, and we don't plan on adding Open GL support to the EQ engine.<br><br>Currently an INT of 200 for a caster is the ceiling for purposes of adding via multiplier to your mana pool. Will this limit of 200 go higher in RoK?<br><br>**Can't say yet, sorry.<br><br>I would like to know what you mean by balance. (I personally think that any class should achieve the same goal by different ways, either as fighter in close combat or as caster with magic)<br><br>**I think what we mean by 'balance' could also be turned into a detailed essay - there's just so much to the topic. In a nutshell, we want all race/class combos to be appealing, but not necessarily exactly appealing. We don't want gross variations in how long it takes a character to advance, or to obtain things. We want decisions on how to play EQ to be as much subjective as objective. <br><br>Are there any plans to enhance the ability of PCs to essentially "take-over" zones or cities to a greater extent than already possible? If not, why? <br><br>**We really don't have the game mechanics or zone makeup in place to handle a 'take-over' as you describe.<br><br>What was the original vision of Warriors, specifically, tanks in general? How well do you feel you've met that vision?<br><br>**You can read the class descriptions on www.everquest.com. Essentially, they're supposed to have the best weapons, the most HP, and be the best tanks. I'm pretty happy with Warriors right now.<br><br>How do you foresee the role a tank (warrior specifically again) will play in the expansion lands/levels?<br><br>**Pretty much the same overall as the rest of the game.<br><br>Can you state your opinion on not allowing binding in cities by NPC's (say the POD who does nothing, but stand around on blue servers) As servers become higher level, one can waste not only minutes, but hours waiting for a bind in small (Rivervale).<br><br>**Waiting that long has not been my experience in-game - I can usually find a bind very quickly. In any case, relying on other classes is part of the interdependence we designed into EQ. Needing an actual character to bind you is important because you have to go out and talk to people, ask them favors, etc. We feel this supports an environment that fosters making friends and alliances with other players.<br><br>Hehehehe, I think you got more than you intended to get, eh?<br><br>**Yes and no. I figured there would be quite a few questions asked, but you guys never cease to amaze me :)<br><br>Anyway, is the Bard song Kellin's Lucid Lullaby ever intended to be fixed? It currently has a 3 second duration and a roughly 60% resist rate. Even those that are in favor of it the way it is admit that it requires a dedicated healer to keep the Bard alive while using it. One resist causes the monster to go berserk on the bard and instantly interrupt the song, and then the Bard is more or less dead because all the monsters are<br>going to be un-mesmerized in three seconds.<br><br>**Don't know, sorry. That's definitely a GZ question.<br><br>Also, is it intended that Bards don't get any magical instruments until mid 30s or higher? If not, please examine the quests that give the unfound/missing instruments, they may be broken.<br><br>**I'll ask GZ.<br><br>Abashi said players don't get indoor sow or selo's or any kind of speed buff because in beta they caused a lot of trains. How about Mobs not getting indoor sow etc? IMO sow'd mobs cause more trains then any sow'd players. If it is just to prevent trains please remove the ability of mobs to cast sow indoors.<br><br>**I agree with Abashi, however that's not the biggest reason we don't allow SOW indoors. The biggest reason is SOW and similar spells were originally intended to only help with travel. They were not meant for kiting and such. Since dungeons, relative to outdoor zones, are much smaller, we designed it such that 'travel' spells wouldn't work there.<br><br>How about adding 3DNow optimization?<br><br>**It's already in - the engine uses 3dNow instructions.<br><br>Is it within the vision to ignore all bard posts/concerns except the least important for two months straight? So far we still don't have any class specific weapons and only two non-planar, non-dragon instruments that have an effect (and one is from Kedge and extremely rare).<br><br>**I'll ask Abashi why he hasn't responded to 'bard posts' if indeed truly he hasn't.<br><br>Will there EVER be a "/who guild <guild name>" to list all the members of a guild currently online (and displaying tags)? I think this would be a great tool for guild leaders and officers for organizing events. Heck, you may already have something similar implemented. If this is the case, please excuse this waste of time <br><br>**You can already get the listing for some guilds by using /who all <first word in guildname>. Obviously, this method is sub-optimal and doesn't always work. Adding better who/guild functionality is on the programming list of things to do.<br><br>Any plans on adding an NPC that can reduce the weight of shadow Knight Quest Armor? It seems that this armor was designed with only Troll and Ogre Sk's in mind.<br><br>**I'll bring the idea up.<br><br>Please comment on Trade skills and what you had in mind when you made them.<br><br>**They're there to offer players an alternative to adventuring, and they're also there to bolster the player-driven economy, create item and money sinks, etc.<br><br>Any plans to make baked food last longer than store bought or even add some stat points?( i.e. str bars , mana crunchies etc.)<br><br>**Unfortunately, probably not, at least not short term. We'd really like to have food with differing strengths and durations, and had planned that to be the case before launch. Some programming directions we went in, however, made it such that implementing varying food durations and strengths a very complex task and so I don't see this happening.<br><br>What good is a high alcohol tolerance?<br><br>**Alcohol Tolerance is a trade skill that's really there purely for RP. There's no practical purpose to increasing it.<br><br>If EverQuest is a grouping game, with a certain soloing ability, why is it the strong pet classes (Necros, magicians) are given the ability to both tank and use powerful magic? I do not understand why meleers have to resort to casters to keep them alive, but the opposite is not true. You must be aware the power of pets at higher level, isn't a pet a last line of protection? A servant? why is it given the power equivalent to some of the principal melee classes? In hp, ac and attack?<br><br>**I have to disagree with your assertion that melee classes cannot solo - some can. That said, some mage classes are just as good at soloing, probably better.<br><br>Has the clip plane slider bug been identified and if not, what information do you need to identify and fix it? Bug: Increasing the slider between the midpoint to the extreme right in outdoor non-forested zone does not increase visibility distance. It used to work.<br><br>**No, internal testing and the programmer involved are still looking into it. I appreciate the information.<br><br>I don't want to get too much into game mechanics, but it just seems odd that the entire FOCUS of the game mechanics (grouping up to take on more powerful critters) impacts some classes so negatively.<br><br>**There are definitely some classes that need to group moreso than others. This is by design.<br><br>When is druid armor being put in and why isn't it in already?<br><br>**I don't think we ever promised druid armor per se. I think it is safe to say, however, that more class specific quests and items are on their way in, especially with the Expansion.<br><br>Any plan to increase the number of spell slots? 8 slots to memorize spells is not enough.<br><br>**The 8 slot limit is there so one has to use tactics depending upon the situation and upcoming battle, deciding which spells to memorize and which spells not to.<br><br>Will you ever shorten the time it takes between starting the EQ.exe file and entering the world of Norrath?<br><br>**We have a few times, and if any additional ways pop up where we can optimize things, we will. At this point, though, I don't know of any ways we haven't thought of. WARNING: the zones in the Expansion are much larger than previous zones and slower machines with less RAM will take a while to load them - zoning time in general will be going up with Kunark, not down.<br><br>Will more items be added to the Smithing skill? Are there items that can be smithed now that PC's are unaware of?<br><br>**Not sure if there are any items players are unaware of, I'll try to ask. As for trade skill upgrades, they're definitely coming.<br><br>Why are mobs not given missile weapons? Seems to me that they way to fix all kinds of problems you guys are having is to make it possible for mobs to attack from a distance if they are not casters. Kiting isn't a problem when a mob stops and crit hits yah from behind with a bow for backstab-like damage (no agi bonus either.) Centaurs have the ability already, there damage just sucks like a Ranger's does...<br><br>**Some mobs DO have missile weapons. Are you suggesting that more should, and that we should increase the damage they can do with ranged weapons? <br><br>What do you think is the most important thing (as a programmer/game designer) you've learned designing and maintaining EverQuest?<br><br>**That a lot more players than I ever thought would follow the path of least resistance and play the game the absolute easiest and most efficient way possible. I would have thought, for example, that players would embrace a slightly harder dungeon with slightly less appealing loot perhaps slightly farther away to avoid crowds. Boy was I wrong.<br><br>If you could change anything about the way things turned out, or the way something happened along the way to where EQ is now, what would that something be?<br><br>**There are quite a few areas where EQ failed in a sense, even though we're extremely pleased with the game overall, are damn proud, and consider it a huge success. I guess the biggest one is that people don't 'do' dungeons as much as they 'camp' single locations within a dungeon. I wish we could go back and radically revise the way dungeon spawning works.<br><br>Some time ago, you mentioned that you were going to try to get a "history" put together for player consumption. It would be nice to have that for "fitting into" the world we are supposed to be role-playing in. Any status?<br><br>**Good question. I believe Abashi was supposed to be working on this - I'll ask him about it in the morning.<br><br>What is the "vision" for each of the character classes - a "sound bite" that advertises the essence of the class? <br><br>**Please see the class descriptions on www.everquest.com -- for the most part they're pretty accurate and sum up the classes fairly well (boy, gonna get flamed for this one &grin)<br><br>Are there any areas of the game, in zones which have been around a while, players have yet to discover?<br>Are there any creatures in the game players have yet to see?<br><br>**Hrm. I doubt it. None spring to my mind, anyway.<br><br>Are there any plans to expand group features in the game? For certain activities, i.e. Planes and Dragon runs, 20+ people are required. This causes issues with communication and looting rights. Maybe maximum group size could be expanded in certain situations?<br><br>**We've tossed around the idea of linking groups together, enabling better communication. No short term plans to do this, but we like the idea.<br><br>Any chance certain items in game will be made rechargeable?<br><br>**Aren't some already? If not, there will be some in the future.<br><br>I know you must hate this one, but: Could a concise definition of all Attributes (str, stam, agi, dex, cha, int, wis) please be given?<br><br>**No, I won't get more precise than we already have, multiple times, sorry.<br><br>Is some attempt made to mathematically quantify the relative usefulness or uselessness of spells or abilities that don't directly affect combat, or are classes balanced more "by feeling"? In other words: Would you call class balancing more of an Art or a Science?<br><br>**Both. We have internal programs we run to test ideas out, weapons, spells, etc. We do a lot of math to make sure certain ideas are balanced. But there are just as many times that we make decisions based on the Vision(TM) of what we think should happen for subjective reasons.<br><br>The vision is frequently cited as the reason for making changes in the game. Do you have a Vision statement for EQ that is a detailed, written statement? No sound-bites, but a "position statement" of sorts that is used as a guiding principle for development? If not, would you consider writing one and publishing it?<br><br>**Yes, we have internal documents that talk about the vision, or mission statement, behind EQ and our other games. I don't think we want to publish internal documents, but if there is really a demand, perhaps I'll write an essay on the Vision(TM) one of these days.<br><br>Could you add a /broken command to enhance the current /bug command? This new option would allow people to "report" and EverQuest to "compile" broken quests ...(like the assassin in Qeynos not dropping [black wood chips] broken since beta)... and cosmetic stuff like typos without the information being hidden in bug reports.<br><br>**We have an email address (which escapes me at the moment - doh!) that we'd prefer players use to report problems with quests. Abashi, if you're reading this, please re-post the quest help email addy.<br><br>Could the language skill be used to enhance the taunt skill? You would, for example, get a bonus to your taunt skill if you use your opponent's language (after achieving a certain skill level). Running with this, could people learn language skills from the creatures they are fighting. <br><br>**Sweet idea - I'd never heard that one before. We'll toss it around.<br><br>It's been said many times that one of the reasons druids don't have quest armor is that we run around in wolf form once we hit 24. What if the armor gave us different tints for our animal form or, better yet, allow us to have different forms. I know that all animal forms are not in each zone, but what if the animal form was a random polygon from the zone's existing animal table.<br><br>**Actually, the reason you don't have quest armor is that the quest armor was supposed to make up for the fact that we removed Rubicite armor from the game, and druids couldn't wear Rubicite in the first place (in other words, we put in quest armor for those classes that COULD wear Rubicite).<br><br>Why doesn't EQ have a quick quit? (not /quit which requires me to click again and again, exit, yes I'm sure, exit, yes I'm sure) I have a time limit on my ISP and like to try and reconnect real fast.<br><br>**Good question. I'll ask the programmers how feasible it would be. Like /quit, though, I don't think it would generally be a good idea to use, in, that you'd remain in the world a bit after using the command, subject to attacks.<br><br>Why do we have to click agree (to the disclaimer) each time when log in?<br><br>**To protect us legally.<br><br>Why are there 4 splash pages to log in? We all know who made the game after all, wouldn't one page suffice?<br><br>**When you have multiple companies involved in the creation of the game, they pretty much all want splash pages shown all the time. Honestly, though, I just click ESC really fast, 3 times, and it doesn't bug me.<br><br>Do you believe that the lack of non-durable items in the game is a key factor in the need for "money sinks"? <br><br>**Yes, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. We want most items to be durable, and now that we've added some quests that consume items, other consumable items (potions and such), as well as other money sinks, we feel the economy is in pretty good shape. I don't think there's any real need to make items wear out in general.<br><br>The Shaman's Alchemy and the Rogue's Poison skills appear to be the only "unbroken" trade skills in the game. The products do not stay around forever and create a supply glut in the long run because the are "consumable."<br><br>**I do agree that as we continue to update Trade Skills in the game they need to involve more and more consumables. We should have made it that way in the beginning, of course, and as you've noted, Alchemy and Poison, both of which have been updated significantly since launch, are based on the consumable principle. I think it's safe to say future revisions of many other trade skills will be handled similarly.<br><br>Why do quests give so little experience? Abashi stated that the reason for this is that Verant doesn't want players repeatedly doing quests for experience. I just do not understand this position. Aside from the name, why is an endless period of "camping a single mob" superior to completing a non-trivial quest?<br><br>**Many quests do give out decent experience (they didn't always, be we updated many of them several months back). The problem is that it's hard to control who is doing the quest and then to award 'proper' experience for the character, depending on his or her level. I guess this is a deficiency in the quest system, but then putting in quest level limits isn't something we're too keen on doing. <br><br>The majority of the players (over 70%) now under the Equipment Loot system (reference the risk poll Gordon initiated on PvP servers) overwhelmingly prefer Exp loss in PvP to Item Loss in PvP, why is Exp loss NOT being considered as a Valid option in the next patch or "ever" for that matter?<br><br>**I think Gordon still has plans for making PvP even more viable, but most of the solutions require quite a bit of coding, and so they have to compete with other enhancements.<br><br>Planes armor is all no drop lore, however in Fear the Shaman and Cleric belt are just lore and droppable, why do you allow armor or weapons droppable at all from the planes?<br><br>**No clue - I'll ask.<br><br>Overcrowding is a huge issue on the older servers even with Kunark many servers will still be overcrowded do you plan on bringing more servers up when the expansion goes online? I'm not talking one server every two months but more servers to help allow more gaming time w/o the pressures of crowding<br><br>**We plan on launching four more servers short term. As soon as we have fairly solid dates, we'll try to announce them.<br><br>Are the mage spells posted on castersrealm and the like really real? Or are they just some joke like the early April fools thing. (I've heard the answer about not believing that stuff but I want to know if its truth.<br><br>**I don't know which post you're referring to, sorry.<br><br>Are there any plans to change the mage's phantom armor line so it's useful? <br><br>**Don't know, sorry.<br><br>Since rogues have crit with thrown weapon and Rangers have crit with bow, can Paladins and ShadowKnights have crit with bash?<br><br>**I'll bring it up at the tuning meetings, but I doubt it - we're fairly happy with where Paladins and SKs are at right now. <br><br>Was wondering why the armor in EQ is not damage absorbing? My reason for asking is that this would help differentiate the weapons (i.e. pierce does the class armor piercing damage). Also would allow you to diversify the classes more.<br><br>**It would be great to have different types of armor that responded differently to different types of weapons. Perhaps one day in the future we could implement something like that.<br><br>Will hybrids ever get unique upgrades/abilities, or just pull off their parent classes? Will we see new spells and skills in Kunark?<br><br>**Being hybrids of other classes, I doubt they'll get unique spells, other than the traditional special abilities some of them already have (lay hands, harm touch).<br><br>Would you consider switching the character development of melee classes to getting more different skills at more levels as opposed to getting new and better gear?<br><br>**Funny you should ask that&#8230; we're doing something very similar to what you're asking for with the Expansion for the pure melee classes.<br><br>How do I go about getting a job on the dev team? <br><br>**Check out www.verant.com for information on how and to whom to send in resumes.<br><br>Will there be anything for players below level 50 in the expansion other than new areas and items? Spells, skills, etc.<br><br>**No, sorry.<br><br>Are there any plans for more of a symbiotic link between the Magician and their pet, (especially control-wise)? It'd be nice if it actually followed me when I used /pet follow me.<br><br>**No plans, but it's a neat idea.<br><br>Do you ever intend to address the spawn in Plane of Fear and the safe spot inside the zone to prevent farming of items?<br><br>**Probably, yes. We'd like to address that issue in some capacity.<br><br>You said: **To preserve a sense of mystery and exploration in the game. Ok, so isn't this sort of a catch 22? I can't know what to put stats into a character creation until I explore the game, but I can't explore the game until I have created my character.<br><br>**Yes, by design. You're supposed to start out with a character and learn and explore both the world and the game mechanics. That may mean at some point you want to start another character to better use the knowledge you have gained playing the game previously.<br><br>Why does Verant think that spending 8 minutes meditation or spending an equal amount of time for health regeneration fun?<br><br>**Downtime between battles is pretty traditional. It allows players to talk, re-group, cast buffs and other related spells, head to the restroom, etc. That said, I wish there was more to do during downtime, more gameplay involved.<br><br>Are you doing this (responding to all these questions) because of the recent deal with Lucasarts and because of other online games coming up soon? OSI wasn't very attentive to its customers until a game called EverQuest started beta. Coincidence?<br><br>**Yes, coincidence. I'm not aware of any other MMORPG coming out in the near future, are you? Is it even remotely possible I'm doing this because I care or must there always be some hidden motive :) (greed, fear, or some other nasty emotion)? I explained why I'm doing this in an earlier batch of answers - take it or leave it.<br><br>Instead of randomizing loot, which doesn't make sense as you've said, the fire giant warlord crown SHOULD drop from the Fire giant warlord, why don't you randomize more spawns?<br>For example instead of the Goblin Knight who drops the BIBS spawning in the same place all the time, have him spawn in a random Dazed Goblin guard spawn point. This would encourage "doing" a dungeon instead of camping the spawn point.<br><br>**Agreed, at least to a point. You'll see more of this experimented with in the Expansion zones.<br><br>One of the great draws of a graphical mud is to see your character evolve and develop graphically as well as statistically. Why is it that most classes have a huge range of robes/armors that change their look, while Monks and Druids must look like "newbies" for a long, long time?<br><br>**There is a limitation of texture memory (which used to be much more restrictive, btw, but recently 3D cards have been shipping with a LOT of memory, thank God), so we were limited as to how many texture sets we could put in the game for player characters. We were able to get around this limitation to a point by using 'tinting' which allowed us to tint a single texture set multiple colors without affecting texture memory. The more uniform the texture, the less 'bad' it looked when tinted. Monks, having lots of skin showing, are the least tintable without things looking bad. Anyway, in the future I hope we have the resources and time to add more texture sets - heck , you can never have enough variation in a game like this, I agree.<br><br>You have said that there are many planned fixes to a lot of this stuff. Would you ever consider posting a list of planned fixes in advance? Not a timetable, people will ***** if you don't do it on time, but a priority list so people know what is being worked on in the future and don't whine so much? <br><br>**We have an 'In Development' section on www.everquest.com that we just haven't been using. That's definitely our bad  :( - sorry about that. Part of the EQ Live team's responsibility post-Expansion will be to keep that page up to date.<br><br>Why did you make the role of the magician and wizard so similar?<br><br>**We did? I have to respectfully disagree on this one. <br><br>With many of the characters 'getting married,' will you ever implement instead of the 'pet' that follows the character around, an offspring?<br><br>**Hrm. Involving 'children' as player characters or even NPCs at this point in MMORPGs&#8230; well, we're afraid to, honestly.<br><br>Enchanters get the instill mana line fairly recently and it has proven to be useless (with the exception of Wu's gauntlets). Are there any plans to add more items for the skills (in a gradual process) or will everything be added at one time?<br><br>**Definitely a GZ question there, sorry.<br><br>This might be a question for GZ, but why don't enchanters get a level 49 illusion? Also, will enchanters get any illusions after level 50?<br><br>**Another GZ question.<br><br>Has the idea of houses in the game completely vanished or is it still planned for the future?<br><br>**It's completely vanished, at least for this incarnation of EverQuest.<br><br>I've noticed that a few of the questions you have answered indicated that the fix or change to the bug and or enhancement would be implemented via the Expansion. For those people who do not buy the Expansion, how will these changes be made or will they not be made?<br><br>**The vast majority of global fixes will be available to everyone. More specifically, many of these fixes will be made in a global file everyone will get when we launch the Expansion.<br><br>Any chance of giving Cleric's a bash skill when they equip a shield?<br><br>**Doubt it - they're supposed to be a limited melee class and primarily casters.<br><br>Why no Halfling Rangers? With warriors and druids in the race.... it would also help with a guild closer to East Antonica...<br><br>**That's a good question. I'm pretty sure we discussed this years back, but it's hard to remember. Essentially we felt (and feel) that the number of races that could be certain hybrid classes needed to be limited. Also, traditionally, we just couldn't come up with an image in our mind of a ranger Halfling :)<br><br>Will Verant ever look at locating some servers overseas in the future? Has the feasibility of this been looked at? Being an Aussie I'm just curious.<br><br>**Very unlikely. The way the EQ infrastructure has turned out it's much easier for us to administrate when servers are local. In any case, with EQ being as latency tolerant as it is, and with ping times not being a big issues in terms of gameplay, we haven't really felt the need to host servers remotely.<br><br>EQ isn't really a role-playing game is it? It's a game based on the principles of addiction outlined in current psychological doctrine. It's based on positive reward and positive punishment. Pavlov's Dog, so to speak. It's designed to keep people addicted for as long as possible. That is the vision, isn't it?<br><br>**Heh, um, no. It's certainly designed to be addictive in the sense that any good game is. EQ has its heritage in all the great text MUDs of the past, many of which were very addictive and a hell of a lot of fun. Perhaps some of the early MUD pioneers were evil, scheming psychologists with a hidden motive , but we just wanted to make a damn fine graphical MUD that was fun to play for months, even years. <br><br>Why were the Jboots made more difficult to obtain in terms of camp time and level range when the reason you changed them to a quest was because of complaints of that nature?<br><br>**Actually, the reason we changed them from a campsite to a quest was because of the complaints of people fighting over a single campsite and the customer service issues that arose because of that.<br><br>Would it be more realistic if someone who has looted a timed-out guard's corpse received the same appointed faction loss as if they were to kill them?<br><br>**Well, we really don't want to tie looting in with faction hits, which is what that would require.<br><br>DO you honestly think gnome newbies should get away scott free with selling their own guards equipment to their own merchants?<br><br>**Heh, probably not, but there's no code in place to make merchants selective as to what they'll buy and what they won't. I wish there were.<br><br>-Brad

<P>
<center><i>Massive Postings from the Official Gameplay Board</i></center><br><br>**NOTE: going to be serveral hours before I can get to the third bunch -- time to rest and take a few tylenol :)<br>---<br><br>What is the high-level view of the current state of the player run economy: specifically trade skills and their usefulness, and the affects of twinking on the economy?<br><br>**Trade skills, by their nature, need to be updated periodically in a deflationary player run economy (and it is our intent to do those updates). Twinking is also part of the economy and it accelerates the deflation, but can still be controlled by adding more to the game (better weapons, harder monsters, etc.). It can also be controlled to a point with no-drop items.<br><br>What are the current efforts to deal with bug reporting? I think a bug tracking system with a web front end would go a long way to easing some tension in the player community. Flaming on the message boards is out of hand because it is perceived that this is the best conduit for feedback. I would suggest a bug tracking system that deals with technical *and* gameplay bugs. (for an example of a similar system see:<br><a href="http://bugreport.apple.com">http://bugreport.apple.com</a>)<br><br>**The combination of the /bug feature as well as in-game player feedback and feedback from message boards has proved to be very effective in terms of us finding out about bugs. It's certainly more of a challenge to isolate and get them all fixed than it is often to identify them.<br><br>If you have been involved in the rogue tuning meetings, can you comment on poison being added as a one time proc per poison vial (or whatever form it is going to take) in DD or DoT form, or something completely different?<br><br>**I cannot yet announce the inner-workings of our poison upgrade because we're not done with it.<br><br>Why do paladins get a quality non planar 1hs weapon (ghoulbane) mid to low level, and sk's do not? Not enough people playing sk's to waste the time creating the item? I have heard that a 1hs is going to be put in for sk's that is of similar quality to gb any eta on that?<br><br>**I'm not going to address that specifically, but rather just say that all sorts of class specific weapons are on their way into the game, especially via the Expansion.<br><br>About EverQuest the game. If you had to do it all over again and start with a clean sheet of paper knowing what you know now, what would you do differently?<br><br>**Wow. No way I could answer that in just a few sentences, sorry. I'll say this - the game is certainly not without its flaws and we plan on making EQ better and better in the future, whether it be in the form of expansions or sequels.<br><br>I've heard a rumor about a dynamic quest team being implemented to only run dynamic quests.<br>Any truth and if so what type of time frame do you see them starting?<br><br>**We already have a team similar to what you describe, and we plan on adding more people to that team. We definitely want to see more dynamic quests and events and know our players do to.<br><br>Why are player concerns on Wizards dismissed out of hand? (too long to go into detail but there are posts 300+ messages long)<br><br>**They're not - we've posted several times in regards to those issues, and even announced that GZ would run some tests after he was done with the Expansion spell implementation and testing.<br><br>How do you expect Rogues to be a viable class in EQ when they come with such a horrible group unfriendly skills like PP? <br><br>**Loaded question. They are already a viable class in our opinion. As for PP, Rogues are Rogues&#8230; they're thieves, they're assassins&#8230; earning trust from other players as a Rogue is supposed to be more challenging.<br><br>Is a "second loot pool" feature for rogue's PP a viable idea in the future?<br><br>**No, no plans to do that.<br><br>Is it a bug or a feature that hybrids get less mana per wis/int from wis/int items than they do from their base wis/int? <br><br>**Don't know - I'll ask Abashi to look into it.<br><br>Also, why is it that hybrids get less mana than stated from mana items? ( i.e., 0-10 mana from a +25 mana item)<br><br>**See Above.<br><br>What do you think of the idea of allowing Shaman to forage for the herbs used in alchemy instead of purchasing them from a vendor? Would be a more realistic idea from a role-play standpoint as I don't think any self respecting Shaman ever bought their herbs at the local quickie mart.......<br><br>**Kind of a neat idea - we'll toss it around.<br><br>Are there any plans to make more "crafted" items from the trade skills needed to complete quests? <br>Much like banded is already required for totemic armor, could there be a quest out there that needs a forged weapon? <br><br>**Yes, but no short term plans.<br><br>Druid quests... can we get more? We kind of get tired of doing class armor quests for the other classes (two edged question there sorry)<br><br>**I think you'll see more and more class specific quests in general in the future.<br><br>Will hate and fear planes ever be changed to something more along the lines of air plane or killing the fire giants to allow high level groups to progress a certain amount based on the time they have available or will new areas in the expansion be structured in a similar fashion? examples: safe zone in points, removing roamers from hate so everything is on the same spawn to allow an even progression through the zone. After all, almost no-one ever really gets to see or enjoy the zone except for pullers or scouts. <br><br>**The planes are supposed to have a different feel and difficulty level relative to most zones. They are also supposed to often require more of a time investment from the players.<br><br>Why is it the stats of the guards throughout Norrath have not changed to either <br>a. more like Paineel guards to stop the High level farming of guard exp.<br>b. guards are made to be casters like clerics and shamans. I would think twice before I would attack something that could heal and cast blindness and/or a dot...<br><br>**We've slowly but surely been upgrading guards for the very reasons you state.<br><br>Why is that a lose of equipment due to a hardware malfunction... i.e. a Crash of the server cause people to wait for weeks to hope to get the item back and be required to /petition at least 3 times a week...<br><br>**It often takes time to verify item loss and to search the logs that we do have. That said, it shouldn't take as long as you describe and I hope we can increase the responsiveness of our customer service team in the future by adding more people.<br><br>Why is it after spending 1 week in hate (7 days) one piece of enchanter gear was dropped yet several pieces for the other classes, yes in the teens. And, how is this fair to even the loot being dropped per class.<br><br>**I'm pretty sure we've made some adjustments to Hate recently and that players on the Test server are reporting things are much better.<br><br>I know that every person wants "enhancements" for their primary class, and this is not regarding any particular class 8o), but why is it that certain spells do not work in the planes for certain classes?<br><br>**Planes are special places, and supposed to offer special challenges as well as some unique tactics to conquer. We reserve the right to have all sorts of spells either not work or do strange things in the alternate planes.<br><br>Have we all driven you mad yet with our inquiries?<br><br>**I'm getting there, thanks J<br><br>Can you speak on the possibility of Rallos Zek adopting the Vallon Zek or Tallon Zek PvP loot rules?<br><br>**No plans at this point to do that, no.<br><br>Why do hybrids get an xp penalty if they are balanced without it?<br><br>**Hybrids are generally more flexible classes, able to melee as well as cast spells. In order to maintain balance, we decided to compensate for their extra flexibility and often power by requiring them more experience points in order to level.<br><br>What are the general pros and cons you have seen with the implemented EverQuest class system?<br><br>**I have been and continue to be a huge believer in class systems for MMORPGs. They encourage interdependence, which leads to a more social environment - people are heavily encouraged to work together and often forge friendships and alliances over time. The only con that comes to mind is that some players appear to be eternally envious of the fact that they can do some things with their class, but not everything. <br><br>It seems like the good majority of complaints fed to Verant are related to player's beliefs of perceived class imbalances. Has it ever made you consider a different way to handle how characters are defined? Perhaps a more complex method that gives the players more control over their character while still maintaining game balance?<br><br>**Perhaps. More flexibility in general is a good thing, but you'll never play an EverQuest that doesn't have some sort of class based system.<br><br>Why are there so many broken quests in a game called EverQuest?<br><br>**Loaded question. I don't think there are that many. There are some, and we try to fix them. But we are also constantly adding new content and quests. With human error, that means we will inevitably add more broken quests as the game evolves.<br><br>Why not run 4 dynamic quests all at the same time in 4 remote locations. They would go a lot smoother =P<br><br>**Great idea. It just requires more manpower (here's hoping that, over time, given such a successful game, we'll get more).<br><br>Good Lord! -- Why are you working on a Sunday?!?<br><br>**Heh, good question. I think that even though I know that the vast majority of players love EQ and that the number of people who bitterly post on these boards is very small, that it still bugs me to hear false claims and allegations about Verant and our game. Some people say we don't care, or that we don't listen, or that we don't respect our customers. I've always been a person that is bothered by people believing things that aren't true about me (or my company, whom I represent). I also know that for every poster there are probably 10 or even 100 'lurkers' who just read boards, and I know that they appreciate when we post. Heck, whenever I do I see new names either post or email me, thanking me for the extra info. So I do what I can, and today it occurred to me to try to answer as many questions about the game as I could.<br><br>Whenever your inventory is full, and you have a stackable item in there, and you go to loot another stackable item of the same type, it says your inventory is full. So you have to manually pick it up and place it there. This is really quite annoying. Any chance of getting it fixed?<br><br>**No short term plans, no, but I'd love to see that addressed one day.<br><br>Why does it take 2 months to patch data? Why is the time interval in-between data patches (whatever that means) take over a month. Why is it when a response like "next patch it will be done" really means "next DATA patch" and not clearly stated "which will happen in over a month"<br><br>**It doesn't always, but it certainly does take some time. Patching data can often be the most dangerous type of patch, because it's so easy to miss bugs, exploits, and other similar problems. So whenever we add a bunch of data to the game, we try to test it for a longer period of time. Also, moving data over from our test environment to the live servers takes more time than just moving code. Sometimes, when we've had a decent amount of downtime, for whatever reason, we are hesitant to move data over and have delayed the process in the past.<br><br>**Can you give wood elves the /lapdance emotes (yes with animation)?<br><br>**Hehe, no comment :)<br><br>A Rogue cannot evade when the only other thing attacking the creature is a pet. Is this intentional? Why isn't the creature considering the pet a valid target to attack if a Rogue evades?<br><br>**I'm not positive, but I think the skill was intended to work in a group situation, and that we assume there are other characters attacking the target.<br><br>Why aren't most items that have charged effects rechargeable?<br><br>**Because having items with charged effects allow us to place items into the game that would be too powerful were the charges infinite and/or rechargeable. That said, it does indeed make sense to have some charged effects items rechargeable and I think you'll see more in the future.<br><br>Are you ever going to reimplement fear and charm back into PVP? If not, why?<br><br>**I sincerely doubt it - the problems both of those spells caused became such a customer service nightmare that we took them out. And when we thought long and hard as to how we could re-implement them without creating additional problems, we couldn't think of a way.<br><br>When will we expect to see new improvements to Tinkering? Right now there are only a handful of marginally useful items to be made with it.<br><br>**Tinkering has a planned upgrade after we get the Poison upgrade in.<br><br>Will the new zones that you are creating post-ROK look like the new and improved graphics or will they have to be compatible with the old graphics engine.<br><br>**They will have the new and improved graphics.<br><br>Will the old areas ever be redrawn to take advantage of better graphics cards.<br><br>**No, we won't be doing this. We'd have to recreate the old zones from scratch in order to do this effectively, and we'd rather allocate those resources (game designers/world builders) to creating new content.<br><br>What is being done to stop showeq users and does Verant/Sony consider using it a violation of copyright laws or any other laws?<br><br>**We are occasionally introducing problems for showeq, breaking it with patches. This typically slows down the distribution of the program, but we've yet to devise a way to eliminate the program. Overall, it's not really that detrimental of an advantage to run the program.<br><br>Heheh... wonder if Brad is regretting this idea yet=)<br><br>**Getting a bit tired, yeah J<br><br>Religion... currently all its good for is getting oneself killed. Are there any plans to ever give people a benefit to having a religion? Say, quests limited to people only of a certain religion, for instance.<br><br>**Not quests, but we're thinking about making it such that certain items may only be wielded/used by characters who follow certain god(s).<br><br>Does EQ Dev team feel that Magician class is fairly well balanced in levels 50 - 60? What's magicians role in EQ?<br><br>**Yes, we feel the Magician is in pretty good shape. For a good description of the class, please see www.everquest.com<br><br>What is the underlying policy behind a nerf or enhancement to a class? Is it the "power" of the class? The desirability of the class (e.g. As expressed by player population)? The dependencies of the class?<br><br>**We nerf when we feel it's the best way to address something that isn't balanced and/or that's not working out the way we'd planned. We don't like doing nerfs, and realize it is upsetting to some of our players.<br><br>My main concern now is with dependencies. Is it Verant's intention to balance classes with respect to dependencies? It's good to have classes that each need each other, but if there are classes that need others that don't need them, would that be cause for tuning?<br><br>**In a sense, yes. Interdependence is key to EverQuest and has always been. Classes should need each other, and some classes should need other classes more than others (i.e. some race/class combos are better for soloing than others). This is all by design.<br><br>What use does minor illusion have on a non-pvp server where most mobs see right through it? (don't get me started on how sneaky and useful it is on a pvp server)<br><br>**This is probably something GZ should answer.<br><br>Why doesn't the tree illusion give the same regen effect that tree form gives to druids?<br><br>**Another GZ question.<br><br>Why is it that monks wearing magic gloves can hit magical creates but a spell caster wearing magical gloves gets the INVULNERABLE message(this may apply to all other classes...just don't know)?<br><br>**Monks, being reliant on their fists, are able to use the magic in the gloves to their advantage.<br><br>Why can't stealthy classes with high enough sneak ability, sneak anywhere? Don't we remember that historical Halfling that burgled a cup from a dragon?<br><br>**Actually, you could get pretty much anywhere in beta with sneaking/hiding/invis. We changed it because it was simply unbalanced - players could map out dangerous areas without risk. I also think the One Ring that allowed Bilbo to recon Smaug's Lair was probably an artifact level item J<br><br>Is there a possibility of Battle-Mage class or Ogre Mages(there is an ogre paladin in East Freeport)?<br><br>**No plans for additional classes, no.<br><br>Any chance that ALL ae spells can be given the NON-PARTY effect like bard songs?<br><br>**Doubt it, but that's probably one for GZ.<br><br>Is Verant trying to find a way to adjust the clipping plane for spells that are suppose to increase sight range? In their current state these spells are rarely used.<br><br>**Turns out we'd rather just let everyone see farther if their machines can handle it.<br><br>**Is Verant considering making Wizards more group friendly. When I am making a group level 20 and above Wizards are my last pick. <br><br>Loaded question. I think Wizards are group friendly.<br><br>Will Enchanters get an Illusion Iksar? I hope so.<br><br>**Can't say, sorry.<br><br>I know you are sick of this one. Any idea how the Iksar will fit in on Tallon or Vallon yet?<br><br>**On the Troll, Ogre, Dark Elf team, those evil bastards! J<br><br>In your vision, what are Bards supposed to be the masters of? <br><br>**Song and dance.<br><br>Will reported broken quests be repaired? (some have been broken for months and have been /bug, petition and email reported)<br><br>**I certainly hope so, eventually. We fix them all the time.<br><br>To whom do I report game bugs (broken programming)?<br><br>**Please use the /bug command.<br><br>Will reported game bugs be repaired? (some have been broken since beta and have been /bug, /petition and email reported)<br><br>**I certainly hope so, eventually. We fix them all the time.<br><br>What will you do to help Melee classes in the expansion? Items are nice but with all the caster classes getting 20 spells or so do you think Maybe they will give some new Combat skills or abilities more than maybe just the 2 that the rumor is. <br><br>**I can't answer specifically yet, sorry, but we've got some pretty cool things planned (and in testing now).<br><br>How much do you plan to have pathing improved for EQ? Will we ever see a situation where mobs take the most direct route between point a and point b in an open area rather than zigzagging? If not, will we see drastically improved pathing in EQ 2.0?<br><br>**We continue to enhance pathing here and there (we've hopefully fixed one of the bugs related to disappearing mobs recently). That said, the way pathing works in general isn't like to change in this incarnation of EQ.<br><br>Is it possible to make a command like /bag head arm chest ect. for pvp servers, this would make it harder of naked pk's to make a profit pk'ing when people can hotekey all their armor.<br><br>**We've heard this idea several times, and like it in general. It would, however, require quite a bit of work to implement and we don't plan on it short term.<br><br>Are there "legendary item" (aka fiery avenger) yet to be found via quest?<br><br>**The Fiery Avenger has been found. There are currently no other FA-type items in the game for the other classes, but it is our intent to add them over time.<br><br>Are some quests only initiated if you hail or talk to a NPC in his native or non-common languages?<br><br>**I don't think so, no, but I certainly think that would be cool.<br><br>Are there plans to put in Player controlled NPC's for quests/storyline enhancement? Perhaps they could be attained through a "guide-like" application system and follow a ongoing script written by Verant's quest/ history developers. Not guides as they are too busy with customer complaints.<br><br>**No plans, sorry.<br><br>Is anything in the works to explain better the history of Norrath other than picking up bits and piece's in quests, both on the God level and within the day-to-day goings-on of Norrath. UO's town criers and GM controlled in game news boards come to mind.<br><br>**Those are great ideas, and we hope to do something like that in the future, time and resources permitting.<br><br>Noticing a lot of people are complaining of lag and Zone disconnects, is it possible this is due to the security elements you have put in place since you are changing things around often to keep programs like ShowEQ from working. Seems a lot of these complaints peaked after you started thwarting programs like ShowEQ and other hack programs.<br><br>**No, no relationship at all. We wouldn't do anything to stop showeq that would jeopardize our playerbase.<br><br>When is the next new non-split server going to come up? <br><br>**We hope before the Expansion launches - that's the plan, anyway.<br><br>Kunark: What are you and the team generally shooting for when you're thinking of moving characters from being able to level from 50 to 60? I.e. comparative power to famous mobs? Would this be considered a "crowning" level with a very powerful new ability for each, or just an upgrade of 10 levels?<br><br>**Probably somewhere in-between. A level 60 player is certainly more powerful than a level 50 player, so much so that we feel it will be very attractive to keep playing beyond 50. That said, level 60 players are still going to get beat on pretty hard in the depths of higher level dungeons.<br><br>You're going to revamp existing unused dungeons (Runneyeye, Kerra ridge) so people will go there - what is the basic scheme in which you plan to go about this?<br><br>**Primarily more and better loot, some of which may come from existing dungeons, and some of which might be new.<br><br>I'm concerned that by playing on an older server I'm going to eventually reach a level where there's nothing I can fight because everything is camped solid. What is being done about this?<br><br>**We're launching the Expansion which will increase the size of the world by over 33%. We are revamping existing dungeons to make them more attractive. And we intend to keep expanding the world after the Expansion.<br><br>How's Star Wars Online shaping up? (I suspect we'll be unable to play Jedi or own/use ships. Any comment?)<br><br>**Can't say much other than it's going to be an incredible, ground-breaking game.<br><br>Will tracking ever be made more useful, and will rangers ever be able to track better than druids/bards (they currently cannot)<br><br>**Yes, but I don't have a time frame.<br><br>Will rangers ever become the best at archery, because currently warriors are better (not including strange new ranger only bows, but trueshot and raincaller dmg ration is outdone by DW)<br><br>**I'm not sure this is accurate, but if it is, I think we'd rather that Rangers be better at archery than other classes, yes.<br><br>Why do so many quests involve CAMPING for a specific item? Wouldn't it be easier to make larger quests involving the gathering of more items, from a wider area with slightly easier drops. That is in the one to two hour range. Not everyone can play in minimum 8 hour blocks.<br><br>**Totally agreed, and that is something we've come to learn over time. Our plan is to still have rare items in the future, but have obtaining those items require smaller and more blocks of time.<br><br>Why can someone do the same quest over 100 times if they want and still get the item or XP.<br><br>**Because it slows down the absolute consumption of content, which is very important for MMORPGs where people plan on playing them for months, even years, as opposed to just a few weeks.<br><br>Why are city guards allowed to be killed, session after session?<br><br>**Because they are NPCs, like any other. We have upgraded them recently, and will continue to do so if necessary, as a deterrent to people farming them and interfering with newbies.<br><br>Why are there many people outside of PAW and so few inside PAW?<br><br>**I think Paw needs more work, and we will return to it after we revamp more zones. <br><br>What is your stance on TWINKING?<br><br>**It's both good and bad, sort of a necessary evil. It upsets some players, yet it increases the replayability of the game significantly. This is one of those topics, btw, that I could write an essay on - I don't think I can accurately explain with just a few sentences, sorry.<br><br>Why do casters upon death have access to their SPELLBOOK and yet a melee does not even get a rusty weapon?<br><br>**So they can help themselves and other players, both casters and melees, with corpse retrievals.<br><br>One year after release why are rogue skills STILL so lacking?<br><br>**Loaded question. It is our opinion that after we revamp poison that Rogues will be in pretty good shape. We made numerous enhancements to Rogues over the last year.<br><br>-Brad

<center><i>Massive Postings from the Official Gameplay Board</i></center><br><br>Is it REALLY true that 2/3 of the quests in the game are yet unfound, and there are 90 caster robes yet undiscovered? <br>**No. There are quite a few, but not that many.<br><br>Do you have plans to allow a command so pet classes can be told the level of their pets? <br><br>**Probably not, no - can't you roughly determine it's level anyway?<br><br>Will there ever be a message so we know if a rogue is trying to pickpocket when he claims he is not?<br><br>**Interesting idea - we'll toss it around.<br><br>Why haven't you answered questions based on the many stat tests players were told to perform by Verant? Specifically, when these test results were posted why didn't you make an appearance?<br><br>**I believe Abashi has addressed the stat issue several times.<br><br>Do you have an estimate on when or if the main storyline of EQ will have an even stronger affect on the players as a whole in the future? (GM Events, new quests introduced etc.)<br><br>**I think this will happen over time as we do more GM Events and get more static quests in the game (which often reveal the history of the world).<br><br>Humans in EverQuest. What is the Vision(tm) on them and what is their place in Norrath.<br><br>**The intent was that they would be neither great nor poor at any one thing. They have the most flexibility when it comes to class selection. Their stats are fairly middle-of-the-road.<br><br>Apart from RP, What do the players get from selecting Humans as their play choice (and getting mediocre stats and being night blind)?<br><br>**More class selection and one of races on the lower end of the experience needed table.<br><br>Abashi hinted that there were class equivalent or near equivalent weapons to the Fiery Avenger in EverQuest. Are there indeed weapons which we haven't found yet (hard to believe) which involve quests other than PoS alone (which can't be done until after the expansion).<br><br>**There are a few very powerful unfound items, yes. Fiery Avenger status items, particle effects and all, are still coming for the other classes and will take us some time.<br><br>I know you don't want to answer questions about the future, but how about some hints on these new melee skills? I'm getting quite jealous looking through the Kunark spell list in Castersrealm.<br><br>**Can't say yet, sorry.<br><br>What is this 'Vision' I keep hearing of. I have never heard from your words exactly what the 'Vision' was intended to be. Not a flame here, just a question. <br><br>**It would probably take me pages to answer this properly, but in a nutshell here goes: to recapture and recreate the fun people had grouping together and going out on quests and adventure playing paper & pencil games in an online virtual world; to create a successful, fun, and popular graphical MUD.<br><br>Can there be more Dynamic GM quests? <br><br>**Indeed, and we hope to have more in the future.<br><br>Why are JBOOTS, such an incredible item that it vastly imbalance the game in outdoor areas, still in the game? Shouldn't this item be made more available to everyone or just dropped?<br><br>**We felt that after addressing the kiting issue some months ago, making it not as abusable, that Jboots no longer 'vastly imbalanced' the game. <br><br>In all seriousness.. I don't know how specific this question is. but are dark elf clerics ever going to get any race and class specific quests? <br><br>**I will ask about that.<br><br>Why can't we bash with the Unicorn Shield? Any fix in the near future?<br><br>**I believe the shield is more of a weapon - 'fixing' it implies it is broken in the first place, which I don't believe is accurate.<br><br>Can someone please explain why the tests on stats are incorrect? Our tests show a negligible impact on melee ability with their use. Can you please post an example to demonstrate where we are going wrong in our testing? <br><br>**Some stats certainly have more of a direct impact on the game than others. This is by design.<br><br>Would it be possible to attach a server designation to each .opt file on our end so that when we play characters on different servers, it doesn't use the same global file for hotkey assignments? Whenever I play on another server, I have to redo my hotkeys every time because each char name has only one .opt file irregardless of the server.<br><br>**It would be possible but would require a bit of programming and I'd probably prioritize it fairly low, but we'll see what we can do.<br><br>In the expansion, will there be any new classes available for any of the existing races? i.e. like having Halfling bards or rangers? (its a long shot I know but I had to try hehe)<br><br>**No, just the new race.<br><br>Server crashes, item and exp loss from hardware failure at Verant -- why is the burden on the players and not on Verant when this happens? <br><br>**Loaded question. Both players and Verant are burdened when there is data loss and neither of them are happy about such occurrences.<br><br>Are more relaxed item and exp reimbursement policies planned?<br><br>**Not in general, no. <br><br>Are monetary compensations like free 1 month playtime for affected players feasible?<br><br>**No, data loss, albeit rare, is unavoidable at times. Compensation as you describe would indeed not e feasible.<br><br>Why would a mob that is obviously far, far tougher than the con system have you believe actually be low blue. i.e.: why is that guard that just kicked my ass not yellow or even? <br><br>**The higher level you get, the more we expect you to be grouping. The 'con' system assumes, over time, that you are grouping more and more - it does not necessarily assume you are alone. Also, the color is an indication of the experience you will receive from killing the NPC, while the text is supposed to indicate difficulty.<br><br>Why are there very few mobs in outdoor zones for people 40+ (aside from the nasty sorts like sea furies, etc...) is this to slow people down once they get to level 40+?<br><br>**While we'd like people to group more and more and to enter dungeons and such at higher levels, we do agree that higher level outdoor areas are needed and you will see several in Kunark, including a 40+ outdoor zone.<br><br>Will shaman ever be able to shrink in outdoor areas? i.e. to fit in the bank in Kelethin<br><br>**Unlikely. There are supposed to be size penalties in the game, depending on the race you've chosen for your character. Over time, we've implemented more and more ways to overcome the size restriction and I think we've gone far enough.<br><br>What will it take for you to admit there may be need to change the Vision(tm)?<br><br>**Whenever something doesn't turn out the way we wanted, or whenever it did but the desired effect failed to occur, we adjust the Vision&#8482; (if it's possible to do so). The Vision&#8482; is both pure in its idealistic form and flexible when it comes to what really works and doesn't work.<br><br>EQ tuning is not by mob rule, I agree; but 99% of your customer base are up in arms over the melee class bind issues (or lack thereof). What will it take to break such an inflexible vision(tm).<br><br>**I definitely think your 99% number is greatly exaggerated. Changing binding would change the pace of the game for both melee and caster classes. It would also lessen the death penalty. We've no intention of changing the binding rules.<br><br>When is the HOLE going to open? <br><br>**The Hole will open when we're done with it, which should be sometime in May, we hope.<br><br>I think one of the craziest ideas I have ever had was to develop some kind of in-zone game you can play that involves a ball or spell aura that you pass around. Sort of a PvP event but I'm just talking crazy here..... would be great for guild wars. People need something like that to break from the norm, guess you could call it a mini-game.<br><br>**There are no plans currently to implement those sorts of mini-games.<br><br>What new skills will warriors get in the expansion?<br><br>**Can't say yet, sorry.<br><br>Will the skill caps be raised with the expansion?<br><br>**Some will, yes.<br><br>Why do the gnome guards in Steamfont punch me for 106hp but when armed they would only be hitting in the 60's?<br><br>**Guards are often very nasty, highly trained individuals that excel in combat far above and beyond the average create in Norrath.<br><br>I have a question of the vision, well sort of, to encourage more player interaction, why did you allow 8 slots? Why not limit it to one slot per server? I think that would have helped a lot of the issues we hear about now if that had been from the get go. <br><br>**When designing EQ we had NO idea if we'd even have close to 8 servers. The fact that we're at 28 now is mind-blowing. So with 12 races and 14 classes, we wanted to make sure players would have a chance to experience at least most of the race/class combos, so we made it such that a player can have 8 characters per server.<br><br>Also, can you expand a bit on why you don't like archery or throwing weapons to be a viable class weapon? <br><br>**EQ was designed to be a melee & magic based game. There is a reason in real life that humanity switched over to range weapons when the technology was developed to make them a reality: they're better. It's almost always better to shoot at somebody from the distance than it is to get up close and dirty. Knowing this, and knowing we wanted melee combat to be integral to EQ, we designed archery and other forms of ranged combat to be secondary in terms of how effective it is.<br><br>What are your 5 favorite musical groups?<br><br>**Fates Warning, Dream Theater, Psychotic Waltz, Enchant, and Yngwie Malmsteen.<br><br>What do melee stats do?<br><br>**Affect the outcome of melee to varying degrees.<br><br>IF poison is spell code why is the overhaul taking so long. i.e. just up the dmg on them and give the vials charges, poison fixed.<br><br>**We don't want a simple fix, we really want to do it right.<br><br>I heard a rumor some time ago about an EQ movie, some company that was working with final fantasy the movie I think.... but any truth to this?<br><br>**I hear the same rumors you do, but am unable to confirm or deny at this point. It's not something that Verant is involved in.<br><br>The simplest solution is to nerf but is that the right solution? <br><br>**Sometimes it is, yes. More complicated solutions, like enhancing every other class and then upping the difficulty level of the game to compensate, are very time consuming and prone to error.<br><br>Why is it in almost all cases of gameplay tuning that you "nerf" class / race abilities and spells? <br><br>**Loaded question (and we don't).<br><br>The average player impression is that there are way more nerfs happening than there are class/race enhancements. So much so that we get very paranoid on very patch and lose all sense humor during April 1.<br><br>**I don't think that's true, and with all due respect I don't think you speak for the 'average player'.<br><br>When you created EQ, were you able to include the Entire Vision, and is this expansion and all *possible* future expansions an expansion of the vision? Or were you only able to program a very small portion of the realm you envisioned?<br><br>**We accomplished a great deal of our Vision for both gameplay and world creation, but yeah, there's a TON of stuff we'd like to do in the future. I think the long, long term goals of MMORPGs is to create holodeck technology, and, well, we have a long way to go J<br><br>What is the Vision as regards removing/replacing/rotating items in EQ?<br><br>**We need to do it more often. One of the reasons, I think, that people get so upset when we alter the status quo is that they're used to things staying the same. If the treasure in dungeons was removed, rotated, and replaced more often not only would the game be better in terms of discovery and exploration but also people wouldn't be so upset when something did change.<br><br>Could you give us an example of a bug fix/feature that was implemented via suggestions and logs sent in through /feedback and /bug? <br><br>**Feature: Messages letting the party know a member went link dead.<br>**Bug Fix: Randomly twirling around when using the /follow command.<br><br>Is there any place we can go to find out what quests are broken?<br><br>**Not really, no. The problem there is that it would require listing the quests, which we don't want to do because we don't want to post spoilers.<br><br>Where you as pissed as I was when you found out you weren't selected for beta testing Diablo II?<br><br>**Who said I wasn't already in the Diablo II beta? J<br><br>Player disruption seems to be the major factor in GM quests not working well. Are there any plans to address this issue? If so, could elaborate on what those plans are I would appreciate it. <br><br>**Yes, and there are a couple of ways to make it better. First, involve less people and announce events less. Second, create a storyline in which players who try to disrupt aren't rewarded (perhaps even penalized). Third, flat out make it against the rules to try to screw up and disrupt a GM event and discipline accordingly (this is obviously the most controversial of the plans, and we're still tossing the idea around).<br><br>Can we look forward to more higher level class and race specific quests (sort of like the Paineel ones) being added to existing cities relatively soon?<br><br>**Yes, depending on your definition of 'relatively soon'.<br><br>Will the Expansion CD contain a few fixes to things considered to be too big to download, say like the barbarian shield issue?<br><br>**As a matter of fact, yes. The barbarian shield problem should be fixed via the Expansion, and other similar problems can hopefully be addressed in the future thanks to some new coding we've worked on that should allow us to fix some of those problems sans a huge download.<br><br>Is the wizard class the way you envisioned it in group usefulness and effectiveness not in regards to paper stats but in in-game real-time situations of level 50 players? If the answer is no, will it ever be?<br><br>**Roughly, yes. They're not perfect, but then neither is any other class, nor the game for that matter.<br><br>I have read (not sure if it is real) that you requested GZ to do some tests on the class for in-game time Vs Damage compared to other classes is this true?<br><br>**Yes, he's agreed to run some tests after he's finished working on new spells for the Expansion.<br><br>Stats in EQ and why the stonewall from Verant? Why are stats details (like how they affect/enhance the character you create) veiled in such secrecy?<br><br>**Because we feel revealing the inner working of stats and other core game mechanics spoil much of the game.<br><br>Is it that they do not work in any measurable degree and are broken? <br><br>**No, they are not broken. Yes, some stats have a more measurable and direct influence on the game than others. This is by design.<br><br>Is the game manual misleading in its description of char stats?<br><br>**Unfortunately, it is inaccurate in some aspects, yes.<br><br>Do you believe druids to be currently balanced as a class, or are they overpowered in your estimation? If not, do you have any future nerfs for this class under consideration?<br><br>**We feel they are fairly balanced at this point.<br><br>What does the 'MAGIC ITEM' tag really mean? For boots and gloves and shoulder pieces it means you can kick, punch, and slam magically, and rogues cant pickpocket it. I always thought it meant the item had stats, but a few things like the molten cloak have stats but aren't magic.<br><br>**Generically, it means that it's special treasure and not mundane. Beyond that, it can also mean being able to hit 'magic' creatures, as you described.<br><br>Why doesn't Dead Man Floating (level 44 necro spell) work in Kedge Keep? This is the perfect use for it but you can't cast it inside.<br><br>**I'm pretty sure that's a bug and on our bug list.<br><br>Why does a person's health go down when they go link dead? It seems like it drops to their unbuffed hps and then comes back up when they come back. Always thought this was strange and just wondered.<br><br>**When you become link dead the server takes control of your character and you are in many ways an NPC and treated as such.<br><br>Why can't you automatically meditate? Why do you have to push the button every time for it to work? Is there any chance it could be changed to default on? Because I don't know anyone who wouldn't want to be medding if they had the skill.<br><br>**Good question - we'll think on it.<br><br>Why isn't run on by default? I don't know anyone who walks through EverQuest.<br><br>**Another good question - we'll think on it.<br><br>Can you fix pronouns in emotes? For example if you type /drool without anyone targeted it says '<name> drools -- something must have $#%&^%$ excited!'<br><br>**I'd like to, yes, but it would be fairly low priority.<br><br>Can you get faction without getting a faction message<br><br>**I don't believe so, no.<br><br>Why can't I remove one item from a bag in the bank, instead of having to remove the entire bag? <br><br>**That's simply a feature we never coded - I'm certainly not against such functionality, but would probably prioritize it fairly low.<br><br>Why is it that we (Paladin) are only given slow (but good, not complaining about QUALITY) weapons? (e.g., why make FA 34/44, but not 17/22?) <br><br>**I don't know if that's true across the board, but it's probably true that our vision of a Paladin is a mighty knight, clad in plate armor, wielding a really, really big sword.<br><br>If faeries are a good race, why is it that paladin's killing them seems to be appropriate to Verant (e.g., Ro armor quest, FA quest, Princess Lenya quest)?<br><br>**Many Paladin quests are set up to create a moral dilemma for the Paladin who RP's.<br><br>How would you rate, on a scale of 1 to 10, the variation in new graphics for the Expansion? You know what I mean, will there be a multitude of new robes for casters, armor for fighters, etc. or are you following a similar routine as with the class specific quests: i.e., will it look like plate mail but basically just have a different color tint to it. <br><br>**Most of our effort went into creating new zones to explore, not creating a ton of new item graphics. We are planning on adding some though.<br><br>One more question off topic Brad -- have you and Hook raced your cars yet? Who would/did win?<br><br>**He won't go to a real track with me, and I sure as heck wouldn't drag race him.<br><br>Why are basic fundamentals of character creation, such as stats and exp tables, not given clearer information on?<br><br>**To preserve a sense of mystery and exploration in the game.<br><br>Why was poison nerfed so HORRIBLY with a 7 second apply time "in anticipation of an upgrade" almost a month ago, and yet poison is not slated to get work until after expansion?<br><br>**We'd hoped to have the Poison upgrade complete by now, but were delayed by the Expansion.<br><br>Why has GZ been allowed to discuss at length what stats do for casters, but no such information has been given to melee classes?<br><br>**In hindsight GZ would probably agree with me that he's revealed too much over time.<br><br>What level is you ranger at, Brad?<br><br>**In his mid 20s - I just haven't been able to play as much, and when I do it's usually using test characters on Kunark L<br><br>Do you think having ONLY static encounters with static mobs as the method of loot distribution may have been a mistake? i.e. 'we should have had more loot dispersal methods to begin with"<br><br>**Probably, yes, to a point. We are experimenting with more randomization of loot in the Expansion and I hope it works out. That said, I remain against total randomization of loot in that one loses the ability to provide context for an item (e.g. the Iron Crown of the Fire Giant Warlord should probably be found on the corpse of the Fire Giant Warlord).<br><br>Would it be possible to allow Rangers to target track? i.e. type /track hill giant and they track nearest HG.<br><br>**That would be a neat enhancement. We do want to enhance tracking in the future, but have no short term plans to do so.<br><br>What was the original vision for the rogue, and what is the vision for the rogue now?<br><br>**The original version included their ability to detect and disarm traps, but it turned out we couldn't get traps working correctly with our engine such that they were truly a challenge and hindrance. Also, upon reflection, we should have had more locked doors and therefore more interdependence between rogues and other classes when dungeon adventuring. We hope to address the latter issue in the Expansion, but traps just aren't really doable. So, in a nutshell, our vision for Rogues has changed somewhat, but we feel they will continue to improve in the future.<br><br>I don't understand Verant's Concept of good and evil in EQ, and am often baffled by certain quests. What races are good, and what races are evil? (I mean orc, fairies, fish, etc..not elfs, humans....)<br><br>**Morality is supposed to be more relative than absolute in the world of Norrath, hence the faction system as opposed to a more simplistic alignment system. <br><br>Do you think EQ has evolved into more of a straight hack-n-slash than an RPG? I personally know many players who feel the game mechanics themselves actively discourage role-playing.<br><br>**No. EQ was always supposed to be a more adventure oriented RPG. Role-playing, in our opinion, is up to the player, and we feel we've provided many tools to help the player role-play. <br><br>Are there any plans to add quest-able Armour sets for the monk and druid classes?<br><br>**Rough, general plans, but nothing specific that I could announce.<br><br>EverQuest gameplay and the need for secrecy. How do we know if it's a bug and not a feature?<br><br>**You can't always, but usually it's fairly clear. Typically, anything that gives a player a significant and unbalancing advantage in terms of advancement is a bug and not a feature.<br><br>Any changes at all to Alchemy planned?<br><br>**We're pretty happy with Alchemy as of this last upgrade and have no short term plans to upgrade that particular trade skill.<br><br>I would like to hear what the original "vision" of character stats was, and in what ways the current implementation varies from the original vision, and *what* the current implementation is?<br><br>**I think the original vision was that the stats that currently affect the game less would do so more. But it didn't turn out that way as we balanced and as the game evolved during beta, and it would require very unbalancing and major changes to make them 'matter more'. The current implementation is that some stats affect the game significantly moreso than others. This is by design.<br><br>-Brad

<P>
Like many EverQuest players, I play the game often, ok, near constantly.  My <br>main character, Nenelar Valandur (E'ci) is only my only serious character; <br>the others have simply been amusements created while Nenelar was stuck in a <br>bad spot after a server crash or unable to find a decent place to hunt.  <br>I've played the game for almost a year - 55 days of real-life time.  So now <br>what?<br><br>While I was leveling Nenelar I could play for an hour or 20.  There were <br>reasons to do both.  As Nenelar is a magician, I was able to solo or group <br>as time allowed.  Having a wife (who doesn't play the game, but takes an <br>interest because I enjoy it) and full-time job, weeknights were short <br>excursions into the world of Norrath.  The weekends allowed me to spend more <br>consecutive hours online.  I enjoyed playing, as my reward was obvious, <br>measured in beautiful golden pixels that told me I was gaining ground.  If I <br>played for an hour, I might not get as many pixels as if I played for 10, <br>but I got something.  That has changed.<br><br>I hunted for experience, doing little to "camp" for items.  I simply didn't <br>have the time.  In an hour to four (a typical night) I could gain experience <br>rapidly (well., ok...not always rapidly, or even positively).  In that short <br>amount of time, I would rarely if ever see the opportunity to get a nice <br>item.  I continued leveling, secure in the knowledge that one-day Nenelar <br>would be powerful enough to go get the things that he needed.  The one <br>exception was a camp for the Flowing Black Robe.  I spent 20 hours on <br>Memorial Day weekend 1999 praying to Marr that Najena would appear only to <br>slay elemental after elemental.  I got the robe and then promptly quit <br>playing the game for the majority of the summer.  I was burned out.<br><br>I came back to EQ to find the majority of my online friends gone.  A few <br>were high levels but even they at this point have moved onto other <br>amusements.  As a 25th level character, I figured I had quite a lot of fun <br>left from EQ, after all, I had 25 levels to go and all those items to <br>collect.<br><br>It took me 6 months to complete the last 25 levels. Most mornings my wife <br>would ask, "Did you make another level?"  Usually I'd say something like, <br>"Yes, tell all of your friends that your husband is now a level 30 High Elf Magician!"<br><br>I've been level 50 now for only a couple of weeks.  But already, the game <br>has changed drastically.  Hunting for experience no longer makes sense.  <br>Until the expansion, Nenelar will not gain experience.  But then, I knew <br>this would happen and so turned to the items I had neglected to collect <br>previously to provide me with the same hours of enjoyment that leveling had. <br>  Now my wife asks, "What did you get in the game last night?"  I reply, <br>"Nothing actually."  This week she asked me, "Is it fun still?"  I didn't <br>have a good answer.<br><br>Why?  Well, when I get online during the week, I cannot do much of anything. <br>  I'm only be able to be online for a couple of hours.  I do not need <br>experience.  In that short of time I cannot participate in a raid or go to <br>the planes, so I'm left to wander Norrath offering what help I can - which <br>isn't much given my class.  I can and do help my friends level their <br>characters, but for the most part weeknights are typically fruitless.  The <br>items I need (and I have nothing fancy now all of my items are 20 levels <br>old) are long camping sessions.<br><br>Ah, but the weekends.  "Being willing to sacrifice sleep to play should <br>surely net me something," I thought.  The past two weekends, I've tried to <br>put that into action.  I chose two items of value to me: Journeyman Boots <br>and the Shining Metallic Robe and set out to get them.<br><br>One weekend I camped the Ancient Cyclops spawn for 24 straight hours.  In <br>that time, he appeared once, after 7 hours.  It wasn't my turn to loot.  I <br>waited 17 more hours and never saw him again in that time.  Powerful as <br>Nenelar is, soloing the Cyclops placeholder for most of that time, I left <br>exhausted and empty-handed.<br><br>The next weekend I camped the Arch Ghoul Magi for 20 straight hours.  In <br>that time the Magi appeared 8 times, dropping the Shining Metallic Robe <br>twice.  I was number 6 on the original loot order.  Two ahead of me got <br>their robes while the others gave up early.  I camped at the top of the <br>order for 12 hours only seeing the Magi only twice.  On both occasions he <br>had only silversilk leggings, not the robe.<br><br>So now for two weeks the game has taken much of my time, but offered little <br>in return.  The loot in the Plane of Hate drops less than the two camps <br>mentioned above and Nenelar would be even less likely to obtain them, with <br>"regulars" now setting the rules on who goes to the planes and who loots <br>what, when.  Besides, I can only participate in weekend raids when I have <br>more time.  I started a druid.  It was fun for a bit, but not enough to hold <br>my interest.  I don't want a second character, I want to go get Nenelar the <br>things I've dreamed of getting through 50 levels and a year of my life!<br><br>And so I ask the designers of the game, "Now what?"  Is that it?  People <br>like me who typically have only a few consecutive hours of time in which to <br>play will be entertained only to level 50, not beyond it?  Don't get me <br>wrong; I don't begrudge the players who can play for more time than me <br>anything.  They earned what they got, putting the time into the camping to <br>get the items they have.  That hasn't diminished my enjoyment of EverQuest.  <br>That said, back to the question, "Now what?"  Given that the program is paid <br>entertainment was it designed to entertain people like me only while <br>leveling?  Will I always be a high level character in second rate equipment? <br>  Has Verant seriously considered people like me?  Am I in the minority too <br>small to be of concern?  Will I ever have an answer to my wife's question - <br>is it fun?"<br><br>It would really help people like me if there were more Temple of Solusek <br>Ro-style quests.  I have completed the magician quests because I could <br>obtain the pieces over time and turn them in to complete the quest.  Why not <br>make the Journeyman Boots quest more along these lines?  Why not offer an <br>alternative quest that requires many steps, each of which can be completed <br>in a couple of hours of play?  Why not put a tailor somewhere in the game <br>that makes Shining Metallic Robes?  Of course, the tailor wouldn't just sell <br>the robes, but rather sends players on quests and will award the robe to <br>only players of sufficient level?  It would make the game fun for me again.  <br>"Hey honey, tonight I got the Froglok Brasso I needed to complete the Shining <br>Metallic Robe quest!"  "That's nice, dear."  That'd make the game fun again.<br><br>Nenelar Valandur

First off, I would like to thank everyone for the positive response on my last editorial, Avoiding a Catastrophe. In this editorial I would like to discuss what, to me, can make or break an online RPG... community.<br><br>What exactly is community? Well, community is the overall interaction between the players of a game. Why is community so important you may ask? Simply put, after a player has explored the entire gaming world, tried all there is to try, and achieved just about everything they want to achieve the only thing left keeping them playing is community. If there is no bonds between players, then one quickly gets bored with the game and moves on. So, what exactly makes up a community? That part is a little harder. In my experience with online RPGs(Ultima Online, The Realm, and various MUDs) I have seen a wide array of community structures. I have seen very weak ties, such as in Ultima Online, and very strong ones, such as those in certain MUDs. What I have seen has helped me draw a conclusion as to what things are fundamental to building a community and those things that can destroy it.<br><br>Let me start out with Ultima Online. Ultima Online has (or had) the potential to be a classic. The idea behind it was brilliant and even the game wasn't too bad. What killed Ultima Online was it's community or lack thereof. Quickly running through Britain told a lot about the game. Instead of having the taverns and inns filled with people, the hot spot of activity was the Britain Bank. Thieves, NPCs, and powergamers alike crowded the area around the bank. Begging for a few gold coins would sparse get a response, while yelling out "Anyone got a ? I am willing to pay x gold," would end up with you being swamped. Greed was the name of the game in UO. The only thing that really mattered was how many grandmaster titles you had and what kind of cool weapons/armor you had. No wonder so many people cancelled their account after they had thousands of gold pieces and a bank box filled with "rare" items. There was no place to go next.<br><br>When I cashed in on my 30 day free account to the Realm I was pleasantly surprised at what I saw. Many a time when I was off fighting poisonous creatures (and getting killed) I was stuck with poison damage which I could not cure. I would quickly run back to town and ask for someone to help me out. Not one, not two, but three or four people would always quickly heal me with nothing in return but a smile and my eternal gratitude. Was this a sense of community I was seeing? Now, The Realm was far (and I mean far) from being perfect but it did get one thing right, the community. So what made this sense of community? People had what they wanted. Albeit because The Realm was a bit too simple to master. The greed that plagued UO was not there.<br><br>So you're asking yourself, "So what? What do these games have to do with EverQuest?" That part is simple. They provide an invaluable lesson on how to build a community. What do I suggest? Well, there are several things I think need to be addressed in order to ensure that EverQuest develops a strong community, and therefor withstands the test of time. First, EverQuest needs none of the greed that haunts Ultima Online. How? Well, 989 Studios needs to de-emphasize the importance of level, weapons/armor, and all symbols of wealth for that matter. To achieve this 989 Studios need to add much variety to clothes/weapons/armor. Make being different, normal. If everyone has something different no longer will certain items be associated with high level players making everyone jealous and having their only goal as improving their stats. Also, 989 Studios needs to make sure that players' levels/stats are not readily available by just walking up and clicking on someone.<br><br>What else could be done to build community? Try putting the emphasis on character interaction and not kill, kill and kill some more. I am not talking adding mind numbing skills like lumberjacking or mining, but "force" people to interact with each other. Don't do anything too drastic like force people to talk to 5 people before they can leave the city but make interaction as a vital part to having fun. Filling bartenders and NPC bar patrons with viable rumors (not those "I heard there is a magical mushroom of tripping out somewhere to the east of here") would be a good idea. How about having GMs take the place of bartenders/town criers instead of just monsters. Wouldn't it be fun to have an actual conversation with a real life bartender, with a real life attitude? And, finally, one of my biggest pet peeves is to reward people for their actions. Why not give those who show an outstanding ability to communicate the ability to take over NPCs/make quests/get special quests? This might just give people the most incentive to help build community and it's important that players feel they need to band together because without them, there is no community.<br><br>With a little cooperation between 989 Studios and those potential EQ players, EverQuest can have one of the strongest communities ever seen in an online game of its nature. Just don't forget to do your part and give 989 Studios plenty of ideas on how to improve EQ.

The time of the old gods is at an end. With the passing of the age known as 'Betatest', and the coming of the next age, the old gods no longer hold power over the land of Norrath. A new breed of people calling themselves 'paying customers' have settled the land and brought with them a host of new gods. <br><br>Following is a listing I have compiled during my travels over the land. <br><br>Sorebottom O'Boredom, god of camping. Sorebottom is a dull and lazy god who requires the same devotion from his followers. They worship him by sitting on their arses for hours or even days at a time at his various holy places like Highhold Pass, Temple of Cazic Thule, Najena, and Guk. His followers pay homage to him by auctioning off their goods to the highest bidder. Their prayer chants include 'Selling/trading rubicite for a good wizard item', 'Get in line', and 'You kill-stealing bastard, I've camped this spot for 3 days straight'. Sorebottom and his followers are the arch enemy of 'Wizfire' <br><br>Wizfire, god of kill-stealing. Wizfire is an evil, selfish deity. He is primarily worshipped by wizards, but some druids and mages worship him also. Wizfire requires vast number of sacrifices to sate his hunger for blood, so his followers travel the lands killing everything in sight. He is the arch enemy of Sorebottom, with whom he shares a parasitic relationship. Both are worshipped in many of the same places, but Wizfire and his followers live off the same prey. Wizfire and his followers are hated throughout the land. <br><br>Nurph, god of class balancing. Nurph is a very feared god, more appeased than worshipped. He is like a plague, feared by all players, who live in fear that his chilling hand is not placed on their class' head. Nurph requires sacrifices, which he gets primarily from druids, shamans, and necromancers in the form of spells and abilities. He has no worshippers or holy places, although his avatar, Arudune is sometimes seen stalking the land, looking for good spells or successful strategies to feed to his ravenous master. <br><br>Playorun Economie, god of trade skills. Playorun is a greedy god who takes his due from every successful trade skill in the form of profits. No skill is safe from his grasping hands, as he leeches the bank accounts of any foolish enough to try them. He is also worshipped by the many merchants in the land who buy items for but a fraction of their worth and sell them for hundreds of times their value. Whenever an enterprising mortal tries to outwit Playorun, by making money from a skill, he calls upon his brother, the god Nurph to smite the offender and any who would follow him. <br><br>Powyrgamyr, god of levelling. Powyrgamyr is crazed god, worshipped by hordes of raving, lunatics. These madmen roam the land killing everything in sight, never stopping, never sleeping, until they eventually drop dead from exhaustion. They are like a plague of locusts, destroying everything in their path in their mad quest to appease their god. Once a mortal gives his soul to Powyrgamyr, he breaks off all relationships, leaving friends and family behind, as they embark on their holy quests for experience, fame and wealth. Those that survive the quest, usually turn from Powyrgamyr and become worshippers of Twynker. <br><br>Twynker, god of newbies. Twynker is a kind god, worshipped by many newbies. The basic philosophy of the worship of Twynker is reincarnation. His followers believe that if they live a good and productive life, amassing wealth and items, they will be reborn into newbies, and be allowed to live off the gains of their previous life. As such, the followers of Twynker are viewed with jealousy and hatred by other mortals. They must endure much hatred and insults, but the consolation that they have better stuff than anyone else helps them cope. You can see Twynker's followers wherever there is a gathering of newbies. They are the ones killing rats, bats and fire beetles while dressed in full rubicite armor. <br><br>Roel Playor, god of perpetual low levels. Roel Playor is a benevolent god, worshipped by mortals through out the land of Norrath. They are well known for their verbose language and strange way of speaking. Most of them are kind, gentle beings who only want to live their lives in peace and harmony with the land and its inhabitants. However, their religion has recently been infiltrated by the followers of Wizfire. They are usually dark elves, trolls, and ogres who hide behind the teaching of Roel Playor, as an excuse to appease their god, Wizfire. These heretics are also known as azhoels.

<P>
<i>Folks, please take note. The title of this page says Producer Letter Spoof. This is meant as a joke, it's not real, and most importantly this is not Brad McQuaid, Producer of EverQuest, speaking. Other than that, have fun reading this hilarious spoof written by Jonathan M. Caraker. :) -Aurum </i><br><br>Producer Letter - 08-20-99<br><br>We here at Verant have ascertained that our player base is composed of various people with very different views of how the game should be approached. Some are interested in EverQuest for the social aspect, some the adventuring and sightseeing, and others the mindless bloodshed. None of these people are right, and none are wrong. These are just different ways of playing the game, and we cannot fault the players for how they choose to enjoy themselves. <br><br>In order to accommodate these different types of players and make the game interesting for all, we have worked long and hard to create a filter that will automatically convert conversation and emotes into what the player wants to see. The power of this new feature goes well beyond what the language filter was able to provide, and the /roleplay command we implemented that changed the color of the users name and title was a joke by comparison. <br><br>Now the gamers will play the game they've always dreamed of. No longer will we see roleplayers arguing with powergamers about how to interact. Everyone will get exactly what they want. You're in YOUR game now! The different filters we have added are called:<br>/POWERGAME /whiners<br>/roleplayeth /newbie<br>/cuteness <br><br>Here is an example of the filters in action.<br>To demonstrate, we will show the original exchange, followed by an example of how each different filter will modify the encounter. <br><br>/normal<br>Lythe bows before Kylarie. <br>Tashiara smiles. <br>Endaar waves at Tashiara. <br>Lythe says, 'Endaaaar!'<br>Kylarie says, 'You're so funny'<br>Tashiara says, 'Hey, good to see you guys again!'<br>Lythe nods. <br>Kylarie says, 'where do you want to go today?'<br>Lythe says, 'We could try Unrest...?'<br>Endaar shakes his head. <br>Endaar says, 'It was way too crowded last time, and people were kill stealing all over the place.' Tashiara says, 'oh'<br>Kylarie says, 'HEY!'<br>Kylarie says, 'incoming aqua goblin'<br>Lythe says, 'got him'<br>Endaar says, 'be careful, he's a big one'<br>Lythe says, 'help'<br>(Lythe dies at the hands of said goblin) <br>Tashiara says, 'oh no!'<br>Kylarie cries over Lythe's corpse. <br><br>/POWERGAME<br>Lythe makes a rude gesture at Kylarie. <br>Tashiara smirks. <br>Endaar makes a rude gesture at Tashiara. <br>Lythe says, 'd00d!/!!'<br>Kylarie says, 'wtf r u all usign emotes.... dum rolplayers'<br>Tashiara says, 'u guys r 3 levls higher then me I only hav 221 hits'<br>Lythe nods. <br>Kylarie says, 'ful mana and hp. lets go rok somethign'<br>Lythe says, 'DoOd we can goto Unrest 4 good xps and kill blues and yellos. <br>my new ax is 9dam and 29del and magic and +chraimsa'<br>Endaar makes a rude gesture at Lythe. <br>Endaar says, 'no wei, there was a bunch of cheeters b4 and there<br>takign all the loot.

I have not seen thee in a fortnight. <br>Praytell me soon what hath happened during the times we have been departed.'<br>Kylarie says, 'I have truly missed your companionship in our absence, friends. Let me have but a moment to compose myself, that I do not shed a tear in happiness.'<br>Tashiara says, 'Hail, and well met, brothers and sister. What a fine day to share with but the best of Norrath.'<br>Lythe nods a knowing nod, as he turns to give a cunning wink to Kylarie. <br>Kylarie says, 'Tis such a fine day in Faydwer. The birds sing to me and the sun smiles upon my face. To leave this place will be sweet sorrow, but alas we must. What adventurous land will feel our footfalls this morrow?'<br>Lythe says, 'Perchance we should smite the forsaken walking dead in a mansion I have heard tell of. The gods would certainly be thankful and bards would sing our praises.'<br>Endaar shakes his head, as apparently he holds information of some import. <br>Endaar says, 'Nay, that land does not want of our company. It is inhabitated by many an unvirtuous and self-serving knave. By my hand, I would send them all on their way to the deepest crevasse of Hell itself.'<br>Tashiara says, 'We are indebted to you, Endaar. Shielding us from the perils of such common rogues is revealing of your kind heart.'<br>Kylarie says, 'By the Gods!'<br>Kylarie says 'A beast comes this way! Draw steel, that we may do battle! The aquatic abomination will rue the day it slithered out of its salty abode.'<br>Lythe says, 'Back, Kylarie. I could not allow a lady such as yourself to take up arms against this vile creature. I will dispatch it myself. Have at thee!'<br>Endaar says, 'Such valor is sheer madness Lythe. I beseech you to see that no honor can be found in suicide!'<br>Lythe says, 'Augh! Your words speak true, but I hear them too late. Ask for me tomorrow, and you will find me a grave man.'<br>(Lythe dies at the hands of said aquatic abomination) <br>Tashiara says, 'Alas, poor Lythe. I knew thee well. Your death will not be in vain.'<br>Kylarie drops to her knees and buries her head in her hands as she weeps over Lythe's corpse. <br><br>/cuteness<br>Lythe kisses Kylarie on the cheek. <br>Tashiara giggles teehee! <br>Endaar blushes as he waves at Tashiara. <br>Lythe says, 'Hiyeeee Endaar'<br>Kylarie says, 'Ooooh, kissies! Thankie'<br>Tashiara says, 'Hi hi hi hi! I missied you all!!'<br>Lythe smiles happily and giggles. <br>Kylarie says, 'Do you wanties to go somewhere and get into mischief?'<br>Lythe says, 'Yesses! How about the baddies in Unrest?!'<br>Endaar giggles and shakes his head. <br>Endaar says, 'I wishies we could, but there are probably meanies taking all the goodies.'<br>Tashiara says, 'oh dearies'<br>Kylarie says, 'LOOKIES!! Mischief!'<br>Kylarie says, 'That's a ugly blue nasties'<br>Lythe says, 'no worries, I gotty him'<br>Endaar says, 'watch out, he is a BIG baddie'<br>Lythe says, 'helpies!'<br>(Lythe dies at the hands of said Mischief) <br>Tashiara says, 'Silly, always gets into mischief!'<br>Kylarie giggles over Lythe's corpsie. <br><br>/whining<br>Lythe sighs at Kylarie. <br>Tashiara sighs. <br>Endaar sighs at Tashiara. <br>Lythe says, 'Endaar, this is bogus, your spells do too much damage.'<br>Kylarie says, 'Yeah my strike doesn't do near as much as your dd spells'<br>Tashiara says, 'you're all going up levels too fast, damn this is unbalanced'<br>Lythe nods. <br>Kylarie says, 'and I'm a cleric and can't use swords! WHY?'<br>Lythe says, 'it's probably pointless, but do you want to try Unrest?'<br>Endaar sighs. <br>Endaar says, 'Everyone was camping with their broken characters last time, and quite frankly, until Verant gets off their behinds and fixes all my spells I don't have a chance in there. When will wizards be able to tank like everyone else?'<br>Tashiara says, 'At least you're not a rogue, they completely and utterly and totally and undeniably SUCK! None of their skills work and they can't use spells and they can't tank. Verant doesn't give a darn about them.' <br>Kylarie says, 'oh look a broken monster'<br>Kylarie says, 'it's one of those aqua goblins that are too strong and don't give enough rare items'<br>Lythe says, 'what the hell, it doesn't matter. I'm going to remake anyways.'<br>Endaar says, 'you can't solo him Lythe. Your character is underpowered'<br>Lythe says, 'this is so retarded.. I'm going to die because Verant won't fix the bugs in my race and class'<br>(Lythe dies at the hands of said broken monster) <br>Tashiara says, 'just goes to show that we should all have WAY more hit points and mana than we get now'<br>Kylarie sighs over Lythe's corpse. <br><br>/newbie<br>Lythe says, 'Hail'<br>Tashiara says, 'Hail'<br>Endaar says, 'Hail'<br>Lythe says, 'what does this red book do for me'<br>Kylarie says, 'CAN ANYONE HEAL ME'<br>Tashiara says, 'I have spider legs if you are looking for them'<br>Lythe says, 'Hail'<br>Kylarie says, 'we should make a group DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO MAKE A GROUP'<br>Lythe says, 'I'm level 5 now.

HAve you been to Butcherblock lately?" <br><br>"Not recently, I've been very busy elsewhere, why?" <br><br>"Well, they're making it a mess, they chant loudly late into the night, they leave offal and entrails hanging from trees in picturesque spots. You have to undertand Ziffy, Kaladim depends very heavily on its tourist industry, from Antonica and these two bums are just scaring folks away!" <br><br>"Duh..." <br><br>*Zarchoomi stands and starts shreiking incoherently at the Dwarf* <br><br>"Well Thor, you're not exactly a comforting sight yourself? You are a woman, yes?" <br><br>*sticks out beard defiantly* <br><br>"Yes? Whats that got to do with anything?" <br><br>"Nothing. So don't you think you ought to give these folks a break?" <br><br>"Yeah, I'll give em a break alright!" <br><br>*Leaps up with axe. Wood Elf Stage crew struggle to pull him off of Zarchoomi. Crowd goes wild!* <br><br>"Duh..." <br><br>"Well, we'll be right back after these messages, when I'll be talking to a Tier'Dal Ambassador whos says he'd really be a nice guy if people would only stop trying to kill him for his dagger.

So you say that people camp outside just to get a shot at killing you, when really you just want them to stop in and have a chat, is that it?" <br><br>"Yes, Ziffy, I'm a Tier'Dal with needs too! I'm an Ambassador, and I travel alot, I'm often away from home for...long periodssss...of time" <br><br>*D'Vinn wells up, crowd go ahh* <br><br>"Is okay, D'Vinn, take your time. Do you know why they keep attacking you?" <br><br>*D'Vinn covers his eyes and nods* <br><br>"It's the dagger isn't it? Can we see the dagger?" <br><br>*D'Vinn nods and pulls out exhibit A. Many Elves in the front row start to look edgy* <br><br>"Can we get a close up on that? Ok. That is a beautiful dagger." <br><br>*snuffle* <br><br>*cheesey music* <br><br>*applause* <br><br>"Hi, wlecome back to Ziffy Springer's No-Text show, with today's topic 'People only want me for my Rare Drops'.

Don't go away now!" <br><br>"It...It was my mothers..." <br><br>"Well, maybe if you perhaps just gave it to people instead of trying to stab them with it..." <br><br>*Ziffys next words are lost as the Elves in the front row surge onto the stage. Panic, Pandemonium and madness ensue. Eventually, the Troll Stage Security 'barsh' order in to everyone* <br><br>"Okay, I can see we have a very delicate topic here. I'm going to take a few questions from the audience...you, yes the Gnome with the yellow tee-shirt on, thats it, stand up, what? Oh, okay, well stand on the chair then. Okay." <br><br>"Uh, Hi Ziffy...Um, I'd like to ask the Dark Elf guy there...What the hell are you doing with all those Orcs, man, I mean thats some sick shit!" <br><br>*crowd go wild D'Vinn looks angry* <br><br>"The Orcs are my friends, okay, and if you can't deal with that, then you can just *beep* off, lawn-ornament!" <br><br>"Yeah, come on Mr Orclover! I'll take you!" <br><br>*Ziffy intervenes* <br><br>"Okay, okay, we're all friends here. You, the Barbarian two rows back, with the kilt, no, not you, or you, yes you!" <br><br>"Hi Ziffie! I vant to know, vot is so special wiv dee dagger anyway? I use this!" <br><br>*Barbaian pulls out flaming sword, crowd panic and run everywhere, Troll security wrestle the Barbarian to the floor and disarm him, order is gradually restored* <br><br>"Phew, okay folks, time to take a break now, but don't go anywhere, because my last guest is someone very special indeed. See you soon!" <br><br>*applause* <br><br>"Okay, your back with Ziffy Springer's No-Text Show, today: 'People only want me for my Rare Drops'. We've seen a lot of interesting people on the show today so far, but my last guest is some-one very special indeed.<br><br>She's proabably most famous for her fashion sense, globally acknowledged as a major trend setter. She's also an evil mage with death on her mind, all the way from the Lavastorm Mountains, yes, it's Najena!" <br><br>*crowd goes apet as a haughty looking woman wearing THAT dress strides on to the stage and elegantly sits down* <br><br>"Okay, okay, so hello Najena, welcome to the show." <br><br>"Hello there, dahh-ling." <br><br>"So your an evil mage, thats good, the world needs more of them, and you say that in the past year alone, you've had more dresses stolen from you than there are people in Antonica, yes?" "Yes, Ziffy, and I'm not sure I can take any more. I mean vistors to Lavastorm are rare enough, the area isn't exactly an idylic picnic spot, and when they do come to visit, they don't even bother throwing me a witty riposte anymore. I mean as an evil mage, you come to depend on a good flow of banter with your prey, "Ah, ha! I have you now!", "You will not leave this place alive!", that sort of thing, but nowadays they almost seem bored and just get straight to it and steal the dress." <br><br>"Can we get a close up on the dress? Ok. Come on Najena, give us a twirl." <br><br>*Najena blushes* <br><br>"Go on, let's see it" <br><br>*Najena stands and does a quick spin. The robe flows out and all the magic users in the crowd get a bit edgy* <br><br>"Beautiful. So why is it you think people want that dress so badly?" <br><br>"Well Ziffy, I can't help it if I dress better than these tramps, can I?" <br><br>*Najena guestures at the Nybright Sisters, glowering in the row behind. Cat-fight errupts. Crowd cheers* <br><br>"Zif-fy, Zif-fy, Zif-fy" <br><br>*Wood Elf stage crew and Troll security spilt them up* <br><br>"Alright, let's settle down. So Najena, do you not think there might be a case that you are, perhaps, and don't get me wrong here, I'm just playing devils advocate here, that you are asking for it? I mean Lavastorm is a pretty rough neighbourhood, and there you are flowing along in that...?" <br><br>"Hey, I'm not about to be told by some bunch of hobos how I can and can't look!" <br><br>*Women in the crowd shout out in support* <br><br>"You go girl!" <br><br>"Okay, well I'm going to field a few question for Najena here...you there, yes, the Erudite with the big forehead." <br><br>"Huh yeah, hi Ziffy, I'd just like to tell Najena...You can take that dress off for me any day baby!" <br><br>"Oh yeah, in your dreams, punk" <br><br>*Najena gives the Erudite the finger* <br><br>"Okay, okay...you ma'am, yes the halfling lady there" <br><br>"Yes Ziffy, I'd like to ask Najena, Why doesn't she just find a nice guy, settle down and stop dressing like such a vamp, maybe then she won't have these problems." <br><br>"Good point, Najena?" <br><br>"Well, I'm a career girl and this IS the ninties, and I don't see why I should just take that shit! Anyway honey, why don't YOU try a little make-up once in a while, because you sure as hell need it!" <br><br>*Crowd roars, Ziffy is forced to stop the halfling from charging the stage* <br><br>"Okay, so Najena, did you know that your dress goes for about two hundred platinum pieces on the open market? That could be part of the problem you know." <br><br>*Across the crowd, various magical chants are started* <br><br>"Oh, yeah? Come on then, I'll take you all!" <br><br>*Najena's eyes flash red, she stands and starts chanting* <br><br>*Camera goes white, then static* <br><br>[We appear to be experieincing some technical difficulties at the moment, but will be back with the Ziffy Springer No-Text Show very soon] <br><br>*applause* <br><br>"Okay, your back with Ziffy Springer's No-Text Show, and as you can see, we've got the fires under control now. We apologise for the technical hitch there." <br><br>*Camera pans around to show a fire blackened stage and a charred, and somewhat subdued audience. Najena looks somewhat smug* <br><br>*Cut to Ziffy, perched on a stool, "Ziffy's Final Thought" written on the wall behind him* <br><br>"We've certainly seen a lot of different lifestyles here tonight, but they all have one thing in common; people only seem to see them for their rare and valuable items. Perhaps having these items comforts them in some way, or perhaps, and more likely, this wealth brings a price of its own. They say money can't buy you happiness, well maybe they're right. Deep down, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter if you are a Mad God of Pain, possesing dozens, or just a lowly Orc Pawn, we all need someone to care about us, someone to see us for who we really are. So next time you're out and about, camping a creature with a rare drop, why not just stop a minute, say hello maybe swear at them a bit, because remember, thats not just a Mob or an NPC with a Rare drop, thats a person too. <br><br>"Take care of yourselves, and each other. <br><br>"Good night!" <br><br>*roll end credits, music, etc* <br><br>"Hi Ziffy, we came all the way from Qeynos to see the show, you're the best!" <br><br>"Hey, Ziffy, killer show!" <br><br>"Me like da barshing Ziffy! It wuz gud!" <br><br>"Hallo Ziffie! Do you think I could have my sword back now?" <br><br>*etc* <br><br>*etc* <br><br>WOOHOO! Home time! See yawl, I'm outta here! <br><br>-Zifeer the Night-Watchman of <a href="http://www.RallosZek.com!">http://www.RallosZek.com!</a>

10. My mail carrier gets mugged every day from Jan 27 to Feb 10.<br>9. It gets so cold outside that the P4 CD cracks in the mailbox.<br>8. www.station.sony.com is actually a front for a gigantic credit card scam.<br>7. My P4 CD gets sent to someone with the same name as me who lives in Iowa.<br>6. Underwear Gnomes.<br>5. The North America delivery limitation starts a chain reaction that sets off World War III.<br>4. "Someone" buys Red Eye and announces that many new problems have been uncovered with EverQuest, the P4 beta date has been pushed back to June 15, 2004, and furthermore, when eventually released EQ will require a monthly fee of $36.66 chargeable only to credit cards with numbers starting with "27".<br>3. My employer starts a new policy that outside software can't be installed on office machines.<br>2. Brad is the secret head of every UO PK guild.<br>1. I only dreamed that I got the P4 announcement .

It spread out before him, the emense, dark Kithicor Woods, through which he must pass in order to meet his friends in the Commonlands. Scytalix Atreides knew the woods were well know for the number of travelers who spent days trying to find their way through. Some had never emerged from the other side. <br>It was not because dangerous creatures lived admist the huge trees. The Kithicor Woods, in fact were known to be quite peaceful. The canopy of dense leaves overhead blocked out most of the sun's light from the twisting trails below. Some of the trails had no final destination, they just gradually faded away, leaving whoever had followed them in a dark sea of identical trees. During the daytime, if one knew their way, a person could follow the correct trails and find their way out to the westernmost part of the Commonlands.<br>At night, however, a thick, wet mist settled, making it almost too dark for even one with elven sight. <br><br>	Scytalix did not have elven sight. He was a Barbarian from the frozen Northlands of Halas. It was dusk, and as he wandered into the woods, he began to realize that he could barely make out the faint path he was following. Maybe he should camp for the night and navigate the woods in the daytime. But his friends were counting on his help and time was running out. He was big and little stood in his way, but he was slow, and was almost a day overdue for the meeting.<br><br>	As he squinted through the fading light, he thought he saw a figure on the road ahead. Or was it just a small tree? The mist ahead parted some and he realized that there was indeed somone approaching.<br>He lifted a huge battle axe from the strappings on his back and held it where it was more visable. He didn't want to seem threatening to the other, but wanted it well known that he would not be a victim to a highway robbery. Whoever it was, they were headed with a deliberate stride right towards him.<br><br>	A few paces in front of him, the figure halted. It was tall for a human, but slight of build, and covered from head to ankle by a heavy black cloak. The face was shrouded with a deep hood.<br><br>	"Lay down your weapon, Traveler," a  firm but definitely female voice commanded. "I bring you no harm. I am a Mercenary, charged with the duty of seeing all through these Woods."<br>	<br>	Scytalix put up his axe on his back again. This was a Mercenary? He glanced down at her feet and saw that sure enough, she wore the gilded black boots that the Mercenaries wore. But charged with guiding travellers, he doubted. She was probably empolyed by one of the Lords at HighPass to spy out whoever had bussiness passing through the woods that boardered that notorious town. But if she could get him through these woods in a timely matter, he would allow her to guide him.<br><br>	"How long will it take to reach the Commonlands?" He demanded.<br>	<br>	"No more than this night and all of tomorrow, if you stop babbling and follow me."<br><br>	"I MUST be in the Commons by noon tomorrow!" <br><br>	"I strongly suggest that you lower your voice, Traveler," she said through a clenched jaw. "Your harsh manners may make me cut out your tongue!"<br><br>	"Well then, shall we go?" He whispered. It sounded loud in the silvery mist.<br><br>	She turned sharply on her heel and briskly began back the way she had come. Scytalix silently followed, peering intently ahead of him so as not to loose his guide in the darkness.<br><br>	Hours later, after what seemed to Scytalix as walking circles around the same trees, the Mercenary came to a halt in front of a small log building.<br><br>	"We will rest here until dawn comes," his guide annouced.<br><br>	The windowless shack was small and crude, but the wood pile was full and Scytalix proceeded to build a fire to drive of the dampness from the mist. He dropped his backpack and axe in the corner and removed his heavy, horned helm. He knelt in front of the fire, trying to dry away the damp chill that had settled into his fingers. His back was turned to the Mercenary, but he could heat her rustling though her packs behind him.<br><br>	"I will share some mead with you, Traveler, if you have any meat to spare." She offered in a soft voice. "It is hard to find big game in these woods."<br><br>	Scytalix turned around to face her, a bit startled by her friendly offer. He froze and stared, rather impolitely, as Barbarians often do. Standing before him, dressed startling in black, was a tall, lithely slender woman.  Her long, well-formed legs were encased in a blackened iron chain mail, and she wore a black silk man's shirt and vest. Her gold-heeled Mercenary boots were the only brightly colored thing she wore. She was removing a black mailed veil from her head, hiding her face from his sight. When she was done, she looked up at him with questioning eyebrows, and large brilliant black eyes. Her hair, now free from the armor, he could see was a long braid of shiny golden brown. It draped serpent-like down her breast, a bright contrast to the black silk.<br><br>	"I asked if you would like some mead, Traveler!" She harshly brought him out of his daydreams. How long would her hair be if he untwisted that braid? Would it cover her breasts? Her black eyes flashed with anger at being stared at.<br><br>	"Uhhh...yes, I do have some meat I could share. A hunk of dried snow bear from home. Do you have a hunting knife to cut it with? Mine is a litte dirty for sharing."<br><br>	She stood still for a moment, her arched eyebrows drawn in thought. Then she reached down below her black leather belt, down the front of her leggings. She pulled out a knife with a blade half the length of Scytalix's hand. She held it out to him with a sly smile. When he held out his hand to accept it, she slapped it into his palm, blade-first. It was plain steel, unadorned accept for the initials V.L. engraved on the handle. The letters were surounded by an etched vine pattern. He could feel the heat from her belly burning into his palm from the flat steel blade. The fire felt a little too warm.<br><br>	He thought about where the little knife had been until he noticed her pulling more blades out from hidden places on her person. One from each boot, one strapped on the inside of a firm thigh, one from a forearm, and the last, a long narrow spike from between her breasts. <br><br>	"As you can see, Traveler," she warned, "I am well armed, and you can be assured that my years in training at the academy have taught me how to use these. I have others too,  that you cannot see"<br><br>	Scytalix wondered where these might be hidden.<br>	<br>	"I suggest that you stay on your side of the cabin. And do not think that your size can overpower me. I will have a blade sticking out of your belly before you could get both hands on me."<br><br>	She seated herself in front of the fire and began twisting the cork off a small jug. Scytalix joined her a good distance away, but so that he could still watch her face. If she'd only smile again. He thought there may a hint of girlish dimples in her cheeks. He divided his bear meat in two halves and handed one to her on the point of her knife. She took a man-sized swig from the jug of mead and passed it over, wiping the back of her hand accross her mouth.<br><br>	"How long did you study at the academy," he asked, trying to draw her into conversation.<br><br>	"For ten years." She answered. "I have killed many men, so do not underestimate my strength and abilities."<br><br>	"Look, Mercenary, why don't you drop the formalities and just enjoy peaceful human company! I am not going to attack you in your sleep! I am Scytalix Atreides of Halas, and I am going to the Commonlands to meet some old friends. Why don't just tell me your name and we can be friends for one night?" He passed the jug back to her, and smiled.<br><br>	She studied his strong face for a moment, her eyebrows dipping into a thoughtful frown. Then she leaned over and reached a small, slender hand towards his face. She brushed his short coarse beard with a knuckle, and mumbled something about crumbs. Her eyes rose to meet his. In the firelight, her hair had a coppery glow and he could now see that her eyes weren't black at all. They were a deep, dark brown.<br><br>	"It's been a long time since I can say I've had a friend," she spoke softly with a small smile. There were almost dimples. She looked sincerly into his blue eyes, noting that that they were honest and gentle, depsite his harsh voice and brute size.<br>	 "You learn not to get to close to anyone, being a Mercenary. Anyone who pays you is your friend. When the job is done, they may try to put a knife in your back. But you, you are not paying me are you, Scytalix? So maybe just for this one night, I will have a friend. My name is Vathelle. I gave up my family name for the anonymity of being a Mercenary, but I can tell you, my family was from the Qeynos Hills, not too far from where you came from."<br><br>	She rose up and stretched like a feline, nearly letting out a cat-like growl. She walked over to her cloak and spead it out near the fire.<br>	<br>	"We had best be getting some sleep, My Friend, Scytalix. We must rise with the dawn to get you to the Commons and your friends. It is a short, and easy trail we follow come day. The path outside this door leads south to the edge of the Kithicor Woods"<br><br>	Scytalix likewise lay down on his cloak, using his pack for a pillow.<br>	<br>	"Vathelle, friend to friend, why do you do it? Be a Mercenary, I mean. A beautiful woman like you shouldn't have to sell herself to the highest bidder. Why don't you have a husband or something?"<br><br>	"Scytalix, I am beginning to like you. Don't ask me questions like that, or I may change my mind. The life of a Mercenary is not so bad. Sure, I slave from employer to employer, doing jobs that are sometimes against my own ethics, but there is money there! You could join me sometime, when I'm done my duties in these woods, and after you have met your friends. You may find the life to be favorable to your purse, and your sense of adventure!" <br><br>	With that, she rolled over, pulling her cloak over her shoulders, ending their conversation. Sctytalix watched her for a bit, wondering about the life she led. He soon dozed off himself, to enjoy dreams of seeking out where she hid those knives.<br><br>	In the morning, when he awoke, the fire had burned out. He rose and looked around the room. It was empty except for his own belongings. No sign of the Mercenary. He did remeber her instructions on which way would lead him to his destination, and realized that she never had any intention on leading him in the morning. He gathered his things and headed to the door. His hand on the latch, and a glint of metal caught his eye. There, stuck in the wood of the door, was the Mercenary's little steel knife, the one which she kept sheathed against he warm belly. It impaled a small scrap of parchment, with the words "HighPass" and the signature "Vathelle" surrounded by a vine pattern.<br><br>	He headed out in to the daylight, still darkened by the trees of the Kithicor Woods and followed the trail south.

	What is this thing we call Everquest?  What is it we pour our money and our time in an almost religious manner day in and day out?  Some call it a game, but what kind of game?  Is it a 3D &#8220;shooter&#8221; where you go out and blast everything to kingdom come and check your score at the end to compare and contrast it to someone else&#8217;s?  Or maybe it is a real-time strategy where you must analyze your opponent&#8217;s weakness and choose your choice approach, style of combat, choice of weapons, and if needed, method of escape.  Maybe it is none of these things.  Maybe it is all of them.  But maybe, just maybe, it is something combining all, and much more.<br><br>	An environment where the user plays a role of his or her choice, that is what I would think would best describe this phenomena we call Everquest.  It was even marketed as, &#8220;a 3D massively multiplayer on-line fantasy role-playing game.&#8221;  But in the aftermath of the rush to get in an experience this game, we find a continuation of the question of, &#8220;What does role-playing mean,&#8221; and the argument, &#8220;You can&#8217;t tell me how to play this game.&#8221;<br><br>	Those that question what roleplaying is are on the right track with the vision of the game itself, how to take your views of life and self and transplant them into a persona that varies from exactly like you to drastically different from you.  &#8220;What does roleplaying mean?&#8221;  It means to alter your perception and put yourself into a world that is not your own.  In this case, you are a person in a world of swords and sorcery, might and magic, and &#8220;good&#8221; versus &#8220;evil.&#8221;  As long as can remember that, leave &#8220;real life&#8221; behind then you are roleplaying.  If real life must come into your conversation, indicate it some how, normally with the acronym OOC (Out Of Character) and say what you must, then you can state you are roleplaying again with the acronym IC (In Character).<br><br>	Those that argue that no one can tell them how to play are, in all essence, wrong.  That is to say they are not wrong, just their perspective of the environment is wrong.  If you were to go out and play soccer with your hands or football with a bat, you would be considered crazy.  Hard core fans of those sports would be insulted that you would actually try to alter their game by changing the &#8220;spirit&#8221; of the game.  What is so different about on-line gaming from real life gaming that the &#8220;spirit&#8221; of the game must be so flexible to the thousands?<br><br>	Maybe because the arena in which the game is play is so new that the &#8220;spirit&#8221; has yet to be formed, but this is not likely.  Roleplaying has been around and is established and taking it to the computer gaming world is not new either.  What is new, however, is this new form of the game. <br><br>	A first-person view to combat from using an array of weapons and tactics against large numbers of foes&#8230;sounds familiar.  The 3D shooter fans see something in this new game that they like and they bring their views of gaming to this environment without fully understanding what they are getting into.  They believe that the game can be &#8220;beaten&#8221; by advancing to the highest level and slaying the most potent opponent there is, and the first one to do it wins the game.  Even if they deny it, the drive is there.  Who has not gone out to their friends and bragged that
