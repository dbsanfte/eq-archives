     I feel as if I am standing atop a dead horse, about to preach to a crowd
of onlookers who would sooner tar and feather me than consider my point of
view; on I go, however, in hopes that some of you will be moved to reconsider a
topic which has mistakenly been set aside as successfully resolved.<P>
     The topic I wish to cover in this article is playerkilling.  I am not here
to repeat what has already been stated a thousand times on message boards and
in previous EQVault editorials.  I am here to state a glaring opinion and
defend it to the best of my abilities; that is, after all, what editorials are
supposed to be.  In short, I feel that EverQuest has taken the easy way out
when it comes to the issue of playerkilling and that this will adversely affect
both atmosphere and gameplay.  <P>
     Let me start by stating that I come from no ignorant background; I have
been an avid pencil-and-paper roleplayer for many years, participating in many
incarnations of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons as well as dabbling in other
realms such as ShadowRun.  In addition, I am a veteran MUDder with well over
six years of solid gameplay background including the administration and
development of several such text-based worlds.  I am not stating these facts to
profess myself as a be-all know-all of playerkilling knowledge, only to let you
know that  all of this affords me a bit of a perspective when it comes to the
topic of playerkilling, because I have seen it in all of its forms.  I have
witnessed it in its most horrid form - bands of ranting, raving sociopathic
teenagers roaming the lands killing newbies by the dozen, cursing to high
Heaven, and basically ruining everyone's day.  I have also seen playerkilling
in its purest form - where a system had been derived to allow playerkilling to
continue while not making it such an overbearing part of the game that those
who do not wish to involve themselves in it are discouraged from playing
entirely.  "How can this be," you ask.  Well, I will tell you not only how it
can be done, but how it <i>has</i> been done, time and time again, on countless
MUDs.<P>

     There are an uncountable number of systems which can be introduced to
curtail the less appreciated side of playerkilling.  These are just a few:
    1.)  A sensitive and selective form of "arrest warrants."  Each major city
is assigned an NPC group of law enforcers, be they numerous guards, an armed
militia of townspeople, or a group of contracted mercenaries.  If playerkillers
chose to do their dirty business in the town's "sphere of influence," which
would include the city itself as well as a few square miles of the surrounding
countryside, then they are flagged as "wanted" in that given city.  Any time
they approach said city, patrols could be dispatched to deal with them in a
timely fashion.  And we're not talking about two weak, lumbering gateguards -
picture a well-trained, well-oiled anti-playerkilling machine. <P>
     Eventually, the wanted status might wear off, allowing the accused to
again return to normal business within that given city.  However, repeat
offenses would result in longer and longer periods of "wantedness" - eventually
peaking at permenant banishment from that city.<P>
     This system could be enhanced by a "word of mouth" function.  If a
playerkiller kills too many people, too often, he will become "infamous" in
Norrath - and might become wanted in several or all cities simultaneously. 
Large cities might even contract NPC rangers to track the player down and teach
him a lesson with a few well placed arrows. <P>
     2.) Administrator sponsored guilds which are designed to prevent
excessive, abusive playerkilling.  In the early stages of commercial release,
all it would take is a group of a few dedicated players and a push in the right
direction to get a guild going which is dedicated to "keeping the peace" to a
certain extent - i.e., preventing abuses of playerkilling.  As the guilds grew
in strength and power, people would begin to think twice about flaunting their
"CoolDudez Playerkillahs" clan about.<P>
     3.) Restrictions placed on "newbie-killing."  This could be done in any
number of ways - including outright making it against the rules to kill new
players.<P>
     4.) Restrictions placed on excessive overkill.  In other words, when a
band of 10 level 30's jump out of the weeds to hack up a level 10 bard and his
newbie buddy, something should step in.  A very intuitive solution to this
problem would be to implement a system whereby when someone is killed by a
group of players (or single player) whose sum level is greater than his own by
10 or more, then he retains all equipment, money, and experience upon death -
simply "spawning" wherever it is dead characters reappear and leaving an empty
corpse behind.  It seems to me both sides would be agreeable to a solution like
this.<P>
     5.) "Safe Zones" could be implemented.  Holy temples protected by Divine
Intervention where no player fights can occurr regardless of those involved. 
This status might be applied to meeting areas such as town fountains, stores,
message rooms, holy temples, churches, resting areas, etc.  As long as the
"Safe Zone" did not include a source of experience so people could sustain
themselves by remaining there, this would add a necessary aspect to the
playerkilling game - being able to take a break and not worry about being
jumped.<P>
     6.) Create a system of "reputation" whereby the server keeps track of a
players kills.  If the player repeatedly kills people who are under his level,
or unarmed, or while they are engaged in combat with another player or NPC,
have him labeled as such - perhaps make available records of peoples kills. 
This way, other PCs will be able to spot abusers and treat them accordingly -
refusing to trade with them, help them, etc.<P>
     7.) Implement "roaming" law enforcement.  Bands of armed guards, rangers,
trackers, or the like which randomly track areas.  If they encounter a player
who has recently committed a crime, they could easily give him a "hard time."<P>

     The list could go on and on.  I have seen systems similar to the one
implemented on vastly popular MUDs and all of them worked perfectly - keeping
playerkilling an integral part of the game and atmosphere, while curtailing the
abusive side of it which has been seen - and discussed here so often - in
Ultima Online or Diablo.  If you will take a moment to review, none of the
above systems, or anything remotely like them, exist in either UO or Diablo. 
Sure, UO has its city guards - but outside the city gates it is a free-for-all
of ridiculous abuse.<P>
     At any rate, the question arises - if all of these solutions exist which
could be implemented in game and become part of the roleplaying environment -
why has 989 chosen to weasel out of this corner with its hard-coded placebo of
the "PvP" switch.  If they claim to focus on the atmosphere and roleplaying,
why don't they implement restrictions on playerkilling accordingly?  I can
picture it:  a tavern brawl breaks out between two drunken, surly dwarves over
which one has the longer beard.  One threatens the other and they "take it
outside."  Instead of getting in a brawl and being thrown out of town by the
guards, as should occurr, they will have to simply walk away because one will
not be "PvP" switched.  <P>

Which brings me to *** Problems caused by the "PvP" switch.<P>

     The switch.  The holy switch which has been praised by nearly everyone
from one end of the message board to the other.  Does anyone see a downside?  I
do.<P>
     The downside is simple.  The switch will basically divide the game into
two camps - those who wish to playerkill and those who wish to roleplay.  The
problem arises when people arrive who want to roleplay a playerkiller.  It will
be nearly impossible because the roleplayer will all have the PvP switch off,
and the playerkillers will be a replica of the twinks on UO walking around
smashing in anything that moves. <P>
     The situation will not remedy itself, because the administration will
focus on adding new areas, new features, and improving the "roleplaying"
atmosphere, instead of implementing measures to make playerkilling a more
integral part of the game ( see above ).  <P>

     I feel that my solutions, and the hundreds like them, offer a final and
successful reconciliation of this eternal debate.  They simultaneously allow
playerkilling to mesh with the atmosphere, adding that "realistic" sense of
danger and fear that PK supporters often speak of while still curtailing the
problems all of the switch supporters preach about - UO twinks, etc.  I
challenge anyone who reads this to come up with a problem that playerkilling
would raise that could not be solved by IN GAME implementation and systems such
as the ones described above.   Notice, the only hard-code I speak of is making
newbie killing illegal and having a few safe zones - neither very restrictive. <P>

     I also challenge 989/Verant to take steps to reconcile this.  The PVP
switch is the only thing left that detracts from the EQ atmosphere - so why not
concentrate on this.  If you want to be truly revolutionary, don't avoid the
problem of playerkilling - solve it once and for all!<P>
