        <p><b>&gt;Hail, Roshawna Rhorer</b><br>
        <br>
        A pleasure to speak with you! You appear to be a foreigner to Katta 
        Castellum as well.<br>
        I hope your reasons for visiting this noble city are more leisurely than 
        my own.<br>
        In addition to my normal duties as a Shar Vahl Emissary to Katta 
        Castellum there is the issue of the [tormented vah shir] in Tenebrous 
        Mountains that must be dealt with. <br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;What tormented vah shir?</b><br>
        <br>
        Recently the skeletons of Vah Shir have been spotted wandering the 
        Tenebrous Mountains ferociously and blindly attacking the living.<br>
        There are legends among my people that speak of Vah Shir warriors that 
        were murdered dishonorably in their sleep by a traitor allied with [dark 
        spirits].<br>
        The spirits of these murdered warriors become trapped in their decaying 
        mortal shells for often many years before they are driven mad by the 
        despair, rage, and torturous experience.<br>
        When this negative spirit energy becomes strong enough the corpses rise 
        and attempt to slaughter all that crosses their path in their state of 
        eternal rage.<br>
        Spirits tormented in such a manner must be assisted so that they may 
        finally find peace in death.<br>
        Will you [help the souls] find peace? <br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;What dark spirits?</b><br>
        <br>
        Not all spirits that can be called upon by those who are in touch with 
        the spirit realms are of good intentions.<br>
        There are spirits who seek to destroy and corrupt.<br>
        These dark spirits are best avoided and kept from manifesting their 
        influence on the mortal realms.<br>
        Unfortunately the foolish or the weak willed are tempted by their 
        promises of power.<br>
        Most who deal with the dark spirits are shortly driven mad by the 
        spirits influence or destroyed by the very powers they were promised.<br>
        There are tales however of powerful shaman capable of harnessing and 
        controlling the dark spirits and their evil powers of corruption.<br>
        These wicked traitors to the Vah Shir teachings are called [Rakshasa].<br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;Who Rakshasa?<br>
        </b><br>
        Like I said the Rakshasa are spoken of only in old tales.<br>
        Whether they truly existed or not can not be proven for sure and the 
        elder spiritist insist they are nothing more than creatures of fiction.<br>
        If there truly is a Rakshasa alive today it would be a powerful creature 
        indeed.<br>
        They are said to no longer have a physical body of their own, having 
        traded it to a powerful evil spirit so that it may enter the mortal 
        realm in exchange for dark gifts.<br>
        Because the Rakshasa no longer has a physical body of its own it must 
        take the forms of other creatures and can not be destroyed with 
        conventional weapons.<br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;I will help the souls</b><br>
        <br>
        The only way for a tormented undead vah shir to be put to rest is to 
        destroy its body and take its skull to Shar Vahl where our spiritualists 
        can perform a ritual to cleanse and free the imprisoned spirit.<br>
        Fill this chest with skulls and return it to me and I will make the 
        preparations for it to be sent to Shar Vahl.<br>
        The spiritualists there have just recently received word of the 
        situation and will be prepared to perform the proper rituals when the 
        time comes. </p>
