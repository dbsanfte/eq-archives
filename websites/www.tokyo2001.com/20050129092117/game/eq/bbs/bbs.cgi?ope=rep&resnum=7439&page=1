>The End of the Plague?
>----------------------------
>In a word : no. 
>The Powers that be in Qeynos have once again allowed what was in our 
>sights to slip into who-knows-when.
>It seems that there was some progress finally being made towards 
>ridding the vast Karanas of the touch of death in the form of a 
>magic-based &quot;anti-plague&quot; as it was being referred to.
>Now there was still some work that needed to be done as the magic 
>simply would not hold for an appreciable period of time , but now the 
>poor animals that they were testing with have been stolen!
>Yes , I said stolen.
>Citizens , be glad you are safe within the walls of the city of men, 
>where your food is plague-free and your animals are safe.
>
>
>War
>----------------------------
>The Teir'Dal are fighting amongst themselves again and now they seems 
>to have done away with one of their most famous faces.
>Reports are coming in from all over that Lanys T'Vyl was sacrificed 
>to their despicable God Innoruuk.
>Always difficult outside of Neriak to decipher the politics of a race 
>founded in hate, one is left to assume that the tensions between 
>Lanys and the Royalty of Neriak had run their course, as gad seemed 
>to be coming judging by the recent scuffles in the Commonlands.
>We are expecting word soon on the current state of Teir'Dal 
>population in the Commonlands outside of Befallen.

>Boomba's Recipe of the week:
