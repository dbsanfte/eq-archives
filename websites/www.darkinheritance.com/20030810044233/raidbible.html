        this guide entails</strong></font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
          is a plan for multi-group raids, and dungeon crawls. It allows many 
          diverse groups to work through all threats in an organized manner and 
          maximizes their chances of success. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          goal of this plan is nothing short of maximizing the destructive potential 
          of a raid force by focusing all its damage dealing capabilities upon 
          one solitary mob (critter we are hunting) while the crowd control teams 
          keep the other mobs at bay. </font></p>

      <p><font color="#FF9900" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Raid 
        Etiquette (Or getting invited back) </strong></font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
          know it may seem like common sense, but raid etiquette is extremely 
          important. This is especially true in a smaller guild like ours where 
          you will want to attend open raids held by other guilds in the high 
          level game. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">People 
          wont invite you back if you were a pain in the butt. Even open raids 
          should be viewed as an 'invite only' raid. Many 'open' raids will not 
          assign you a group if you have earned a reputation for greed, incompetence, 
          or immaturity. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These 
          are all suggestions on how to conduct yourself on a raid. Following 
          them will pay off. </font></p>

            watch for the shout to RE-ASSIST!!! The number one cause of wipe outs 
            on raids is someone fails to re-assist and the enchanters can then

          <li><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ignore 
            the 2nd assist if the main assist is still alive and fighting. Sometimes

            should only be assisted IF the main assist is dead or link dead, or

            willing to wait patiently on a rez if you die, see above about sending 
            raid leader tells. If you die, sit, wait, the call will come &quot;Anyone 
            not rezzed?&quot; and thats when you speak up. Your group leader will 
            know you are dead and will make sure you get a rez most of the time. 
            </font></li>
          <li><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Never, 
            ever publicly criticize a raid leader on his raid, or after it. You 
            make yourself look bad. Running a raid is an enormous amount of work 
            and responsibility, especially for dragon or planar raids. If you 
            feel the raid was run poorly, let the raid end on a happy note and 
            speak to the raid leader a few days later. Approaching them with a 
            simple &quot;I'm curious as to why this was handled a certain way&quot; 
            will make you seem less criticizing and open a discussion. Telling 
            them they sucked will get you a reputation you wont outlive. Even 
            if they did suck. </font></li>

            your group leader a tell, and then forget about it. Good raid leaders 
            will correct improper conduct. Just be sure you are doing your job

            to a new target Sometimes a mob cannot be mezzed by the enchanters 
            and when that happens the main assist will target that mob and call 
            for a RE-ASSIST. All members of the raid must focus on this new mob 
            and the enchanters will then put the mob you were fighting before 
            to sleep. If just one person does not make the switch, the enchanter 
            cannot mez the mob. The mob will then kill that person, then the enchanter, 
            and then random players with a free hand until the unmezzable mob

            back</font></strong> Once again if one person does not do this, its 
            pointless. Often times you see raid leaders having to spam PULL BACK 
            over and over and over and over and still people are not doing it!!!!!! 
            When you are told to pull back ABSOLUTELY everyone must return to 
            camp and not attack the mob til its back in melee range. If one person 
            sits way out and didn't pull back, they will be preventing that mob 
            from returning to the raid force. They will also die cause they are 
            soloing a mob that can kill them in 5 hits. And they will also drag 
            agro from all other critters roaming past who will then train at the 
            raid once that player is dead. SO PULL BACK AT ONCE when you see the

            There is a shout that such-n-such an item has dropped and to send 
            a tell to so-and-so to get in on the loot roll. If you miss the instructions 
            and don't get loot, its your fault not the raid leaders.</font></li>
          <li><font color="#FF9900" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AND 
            REMEMBER - NEVER TARGET WITH YOUR MOUSE, ALWAYS USE ASSIST TO TARGET</font><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            I just cannot stress that enough. The whole system fails if people 
            don't assist. </font></li>

          When you have 3 pets on a mob, and they are casting, one of them will 
          be in the middle of a cast as mez lands. Its pure math. Kill your pet 
          when you are told to. </font></p>

          a raid is wiped because of lousy pet control the response is normally 
          quite vocal. So remember, be a responsible pet owner. Keep Sparky on 
          a tight leash.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
          you gate out on a raid you will make enemies I guarantee it. Never leave 
          a raid without telling your group leader you need to go. Never leave 
          a raid without permission. Avoid leaving raids early but if you must 
          get permission first. Otherwise you will be assumed to have abandoned 
          the raid and that is a very very very bad reputation to earn.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Never 
          evac without the raid leader calling it! If you evac your group out 
          on your own accord you are going to hear about it. From your group and 
          your Raid Leader. Often if you evac there is no way to get you all back 
          to the raid. Sometimes its preferable to let a raid wipe out rather 
          then evac, so a camped cleric can rez you back.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
          you hear the command to evac, and you can gate, gate!! The raid leader 
          is trying to avoid a lengthy corpse run and the few bodies the better 
          so if EVAC is called, tell your group EVAC Called, I am gating!! Unless 
          you are the evacer of course then you had better take your group with 
          ya</font></p>
