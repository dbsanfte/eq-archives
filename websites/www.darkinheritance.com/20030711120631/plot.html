    <td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"> <p align="center"><font color="#FF9900" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The 
        Official Guild Plot</strong></font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To 
        know the History of the Triad is to understand it. For the Triad sprung 
        from the minds of the Gods, and not of mortals.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many 
        centuries ago, the dark Gods gathered together to plot. However, the dark 
        Gods, so painfully self-serving, were unable to agree on nearly all ideas. 
        Save one.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
        they shared one common goal, and that was the destruction of the Gods 
        of Light, and the Gods Neutrality or Shadow. Knowing that these Gods drew 
        strength from their followers, and unable to attack them directly as Veeshan 
        forbade it, they created Domus Noctis.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Innoruuk 
        through His Priests placed Domus Noctis, after much arguing, deep within 
        Neriak and elevated to Noble Standing, and the church emptied its coffers 
        to fund the birth of Domus Noctis. The Dark Ones found a particularly 
        evil and devoted young Shadowknight, Subashai, and sat her upon the seat 
        of this House. She quickly had Domus Noctis residences placed within each 
        of the evil cities of the land. Each of these are located in secret and 
        often used for meetings of the House Council.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today 
        House Noctis has its hand in many things. Brothels, slave trading, thief 
        rings, smuggling. Anything that requires subterfuge, or dark intentions, 
        in order to make a profit, likely has a member of Domus Noctis involved 
        at some level.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        purpose of Domus Noctis, was to do what the Gods could not do directly. 
        Destroy the realm of the light and shadow. Bring harm to the followers 
        of such Gods. Recruit followers for the Dark. To win over the lands, hearts, 
        and minds of mortals by any means necessary.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        Gods of Light and Shadow were not unaware of what had occurred. The saw 
        the genius in the plans of the Dark Ones and moved to action, lest be 
        caught at a disadvantage.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        Tribunal formed Domus Umbra in a flash. Urthor, a Shaman of Halas, was 
        sent forth and told to turn over a large stone buried beneath the snows 
        of Everfrost. Upon doing sow he found the boulder to be riddled with gold. 
        The Tribunal had him form Domus Umbra with the wealth, and explained to 
        him the purpose for such a thing, to win over the hearts, minds, and lands 
        of mortals, to the ways of Neutrality and Order.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tunare, 
        the mother of all, was asked by the Gods of Light to find someone to lead 
        and build Domus Solis, the House of Light. Knowing that the very nature 
        of the House would require clash, she called out the Half Elf Paladin, 
        Noray. Noray was a follower of Karana, and his heart was pure and his 
        mind that of a raging storm, bent upon the destruction of all things dark 
        and evil.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Noray 
        was from a family of great wealth, and he established Domus Solis.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many 
        Centuries have gone by since the Triad was formed. Leaders of each have 
        come and gone yet the original goals are always held true.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many 
        times have the Houses gone to war, or called truces to shore up their 
        strength.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Such 
        a truce rains now. For with the discovery of life and access to the moon 
        Luclin, and the doorways opening to the great demi-planes, each House 
        finds itself short to establish itself upon these new lands.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Altus 
        Concilium, the Great Council, oversees the truce.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How 
        long this truce will last is obvious. It will last until one House has 
        become much stronger then the others. That is how long each truce has 
        lasted in the past and likely will again.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And 
        so we find ourselves upon Norrath today. Three Houses rebuilding, tied 
        together by a truce that defies their very nature.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        <font color="#FF9900"><strong>(Out of Character)</strong></font></font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        guild plot has been made deliberately light, so as to provide only a backdrop 
        for the guild members of all three Houses to Roleplay against / with.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All 
        members that wish to RP within our guild are expected to know this brief 
        history and to leave it unchanged in all their writings or roleplay.</font></p>
