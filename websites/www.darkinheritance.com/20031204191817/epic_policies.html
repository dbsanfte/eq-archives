            Inheritance is a small guild. Epic quests are not the reason for our 
            existence. However, we want to assist our members earning their epics 
            when the desire is there.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#6699FF" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Upon 
            reaching level 50, any full (non probationary) member of Dark Inheritance 
            may submit their name to me for inclusion <a href="mailto:serrikryuujin@hotmail.com">here</a>. 
            If you do not, then we cannot track your epic or help you complete 
            it. Nor will we try to. We cannot do epics FOR you, but we can help 
            you do yours. <font color="#FFFF00"><strong>Epics require that YOU, 
            the person questing the epic, do most of the work,</strong></font> 
            not your guild.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#6699FF" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do 
            your part! Do the solo camps and single group portions of your epic 
            on your own and with close friends, as much as possible. As a guild, 
            our nights where we can field full strength are limited. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#6699FF" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dark 
            Inheritance makes no promises that you will obtain your epic. Nor 
            do we feel we need to help anyone acheive their epic that does not 
            wish to return the favor when others need help. Epics are a team effort.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#6699FF" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Members 
            must also realise that they may need to join open raids or join raids 
            of other guilds, or solicit outside help in order to complete certain 
            portions of their epic. Many epic targets are simply beyond the combined 
            strength of our guild to overcome at this time.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#6699FF" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
            hope that all members that are truly determined to get their epic, 
            continue to level. If you are not leveling up past 50 you will not 
            be effective help in obtaining your own epic or that of others. All 
            epics require a minimal amount of level 60s to complete. Having said 
            that, a small group of level 60s can accomplish ALOT. The reality 
            of a small guild is that if we work on epics together, we shall have 
            to level to overcome the lack of numbers. This is the simple math 
            of Epics.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#6699FF" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
            encourage all members to be patient. If you play part time it can 
            take over a year to do some of the more difficult epics. Being impatient, 
            or sullen about this fact will not change it. As I do, I encourage 
            you all to do the portions you can, as you are able to and when the 
            opportunity arrives to do them. You never know what the future may 
            hold for both our guild and you individually.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>To 
            prepare for doing your epic I suggest the following:</strong></font></p>

        <li>
          <div align="left"><font color="#6699FF" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Continue 
            to level - do not ding 50 then stop leveling because you are epic 
            level. At level 50 you are not sufficiently high enough in level to 
            be effective help in completing your own quest, let alone that of 
            others. Continue to invest time into your character. Epics are a HUGE 
            time commitment and leveling is part of that. Especially in a small 
            guild</font></div>

          <div align="left"><font color="#6699FF" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Collect 
            Resist Gear - Do not rush out and buy a tonne of resist gear. But 
            collect a set, little by little. You should be able to keep your magic 
            resistance above 100 and any other additional resist above 100. For 
            example a raid may call for cold and magic resist gear, or fire and 
            magic resist. It is almost always magic plus one other resist. Resist 
            gear makes an enormous difference against certain epic mobs</font></div>

            mates are prepared to invest time and likely some experience losing 
            deaths in seeing you get your epic. Be sure you are willing to do 
            the same for them before you start your own quest.</font></div>

            They are meant to be hard. Accept that some parts of your Epic will
