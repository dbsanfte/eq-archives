        <strong>Other Systems And Why We Don't Use Them: </strong></font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
          have given this much thought. After over 2 years in guild admin I have 
          been involved in many loot systems. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Can 
          and Will Use&#8221; is a very well intentioned system that is always 
          abused by someone. In every single raid I have been in there is always 
          someone who seems to think this means &#8220;Can Use, its my divine 
          right to roll on it even if I&#8217;m going to sell it&#8221; </font></p>
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Can 
          and Will Use&#8221; requires judgement calls, many of them, by the Master 
          Looter. And can result in grumbling by raid attendees who do not agree 
          with the decisions. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Points 
          Systems&#8221; are very good in that they reward, in the long run, those 
          who put in the most effort by ensuring they get the most drops. The 
          drawback is that part time members feel slighted, and the points are 
          a management nightmare to track. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To 
          me, the ideal loot system requires no judgement calls by the guild management, 
          period. Instead it relies on peer pressure in a very real way, to ensure 
          members take the morale high ground when they loot or roll on loot.
