        Of Dark Inheritance</strong></font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF9900" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Section 
        1 - Out of Character rules </strong></font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Note: 
          Each of the three Houses may have additional rules but none will supercede 
          these general rules</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not 
          knowing these rules is not an excuse, all members MUST read and know 
          the guild charter </font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mutual 
          Respect - Members must, at all times, treat each other, and other players 
          on the server, with maturity and respect. You must be a legal adult 
          in real life to join this guild and you will be expected to act like 
          an adult at all times.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          Tasteful Roleplay Character Names - While we understand that Verant 
          has loosened its naming policy, Dark Inheritance will not allow any 
          character to join the guild who's name is out of sync with a roleplay 
          environment. Most names that form sentences, sound like titles, or contain 
          words like Pimp, Shiz, etc., will assuredly cause your guild application 
          for those characters to be refused. In short, your name should sound 
          like a name and not a moniker, if you wish to seriously join and roleplay 
          with our guild. Some exceptions may be made but are at our sole discretion 
          and all 3 House Leaders must agree to allow the exception to occur, 
          with the Guild Leader retaining the right to veto. This also applies 
          to any combination of first name and surname that violates the guild 
          name policy.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          Respect the Guild Tag - Don't initiate or participate in behavior such 
          as camp stealing, or kill stealing, ninja looting, etc., that degrades 
          the enjoyment of the game for others.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          No Profanity - Do not embarrass our guild by using profanity in any 
          public channel, this includes shouts, OOC and especially, guild chat. 
          We don't want it. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          Respect the Roleplayers - This guild is not roleplay mandatory BUT it 
          is to always remain roleplay friendly and roleplay encouraged. Members 
          who disrespect members for roleplaying their characters will be tossed 
          out.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          Talk to the Character not the Person - If someone is roleplaying treat 
          them as though they are the character they are roleplaying and not Joe 
          Smith from New York. Just as we don't force you to roleplay, do not 
          force those that are roleplaying to break character. If you need to 
          speak with them OOC simply send them a tell saying OOC.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Designate 
          your OOC text in Guild Chat - As of June 1, 2003, all Out of Character 
          discussion in the guild channel must be designated as such. Acceptable 
          methods are to prephase the chat with the term OOC such as &quot;OOC 
          - Work sucked today but then again work sucks everyday&quot; or to place 
          the OOC text in brackets such as &quot;((Work sucked today))&quot; Other 
          commonly used methods to identify OOC chatter are also acceptable.</font></p>

      <blockquote> 
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Competence 
          - In order to attend raids we expect you to be competent as a player 
          of your chosen class. We expect enchanters to be good at mob control, 
          warriors to be good at main assist roles, etc., know your job on a raid. 
          We also expect you to follow all instructions, assist correctly, and 
          be a team player.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          Official Raid Strategy - Know the <a href="raidbible.html">official 
          guild raid strategy</a>, and know it well. Attending a raid and not 
          knowing the strategy will get you noticed, and not in a good way. Learn 
          our guild raid strategy and you will find things run like clockwork 
          and the entire raid experience is a lot more fun. And by the way, we 
          don't care if you have pulled in North TOV a million times or run 200,000 
          vox raids, you have to know and abide by our strategy on our raids.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Loot 
          Distribution - Know the <a href="lootrules.html">official loot rules</a> 
          of the guild. Not knowing will not be an excuse. Ninja looters both 
          in exp groups and in raids, will be kicked out of our guild.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Raid 
          Chat Channel will be OOC - The raid chat channel will be in OOC, the 
          raid leaders and pullers and main assists simply cannot stay in character 
          during some busy events. So, all raid channel communications will be 
          OOC.</font></p>

      <blockquote> 
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While 
          we realize everyone roleplays differently we have some guidelines that 
          all members should strive to follow so that all members can roleplay 
          on the same piece of solid ground.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          The Guild Plot is Immutable - You may not in any roleplay, or writing, 
          alter the information in the official guild plot. It will not ever change 
          to suit your own story, your story will have to work around it. The 
          guild plot is deliberately left sparse so there is alot of room for 
          personal and House creativity.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          Remember there is a Person behind the Personae! - Never forget that 
          there is a person behind the persona! If you have had a particularly 
          heated roleplay discussion with someone please send them an OOC tell 
          to make sure you have not hurt their feelings. Its not a sign of weak 
          roleplay to do so, but a sign of mature roleplay.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          Remember we are all friends OOC - We may roleplay as rivals and enemies 
          but the people behind the characters remain friends and are willing 
          to help each other as needed. We are all united by a guild tag and are 
          all roleplayers on a server that is not very roleplay conducive at the 
          best of times. When doing raids, or exp groups, make room for your roleplay 
          adversaries for they provide you, and you them, with a richer game experience.</font></p>
