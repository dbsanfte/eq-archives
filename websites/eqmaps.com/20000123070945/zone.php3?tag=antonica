There are 2 methods of getting from Freeport to Queynos or Vice versa:
<br><br>
The High Road
<br>
<i> - Freeport, through High Pass, Down into the Karanas, Enter Queynos Hills, Enter Queynos.</i>
<br><br>
The Low Road
<br>
<i>- Freeport, through the Oasis and S Ro, Innothule, Feerot, Lake Rathe, Rathe Mtn's, Lake Rathe, through the Karanas into Q Hills into Queynos.</i>
<br><br>
Now many people who aren't evil are laughing about the Low Road right now because it seems to be a lot longer. Actually time wise it is maybe an additional 10 minutes real time as several of the zone you will not be spending much time in.
<br><br>
<b>The High Road</b>
<br>
Starting from the West Gate in Freeport. The first thing you should do is get your spirit bound to Freeport if you haven't done so already. Now if you wish you can auction to buy a SoW, or ask a passing druid or shaman. I personally just like to run Iron Man as it adds a certain spice to it (ed. note - The
writer of this is both a rogue and insane, you should get a SoW if at all possible) when your running past Giants and Griffins.
<br><br>
Run off into the newbie zone, zone into the east commonlands and bear to your left. This will take you along the wall, past the cave to N. Ro and follow this until you zone into West Commons.
<br><br>
Now in days of old the west commons were much more dangerous, however nowadays with everyone and their brother chasing down Hill Giants for quests and fun (many of the people who made this run in the good old days are out for good old vengeance for getting good old flattened) you can cut across the zone without to much trouble. By cut across, I want you to make a right turn, and run laterally up the invisible boundary you just crossed over from E Commons, until you reach the OTHER zone wall. The reason for this isn't really Hill Giants, although you do see them in the sandy areas. HG's you will see coming. The real dangers in the dunes are Ghouls for lower level characters, which can spell certain death with root and a lack of magical weapons. Also in the corner of the zone along the "Sandy" zone wall Shadow Men lie in ambush. So now your on the "Green" side. This side has 3 threats, none of which roam. A Tower with undead (when you see a tower, give it some berth, go around and keep going), a derish
cutthroat camp (give it some space and keep going) and an orc camp which really is nestled back somewhat so you may even miss this one on the zone wall. Hazards to navigation include Dragoon Zytll, a level 25ish NPC who hits like a level 30-35ish NPC and will cast Fear and the roaming HG or Griffin. If you stay on the wall you should be able to avoid all 3 of these and not have any trouble. Once you make the corner of the zone you will see the pas to kithicor.
<br><br>
Recently Kithicor became a bloodbath when the undead took it over on Halloween and the entrance to the Plane of Hate was opened. Now in theory eventually the undead will be removed, however until then DO NOT try to cross kithicor till at least Noon In-Game time. To find out what time it is in game simply time /time and it will ive you the Time InGame and the time in your area as well. The reason your doing this is because the undead in Kith only spawn at night, but
will hang around till dealt with, so noon is usually enough time. Also for any would be hero's the undead range from levels 30 straight up to 50+. Your best bet to pray that SoW you purchased is still up (or buy anther in West Commons) and when you zone in, turn right and follow the wall. Doing this is NOT full proof, as the undead do roam up high on the walls and people train them there coming through. Additionally, at teh 2/3's mark through this hair raising part
of your journey you will come to a large hole in the wall. Don't worry, this is
the entrance to rivervale, not the PoH. The bad news is, lots of high level people will be pulling undead to this spot to fight since it is a zone border and therefore an escape route. You may zone into Rivervale to bind if major battles are going on, however I recomend pushing on the last leg of Kith and zoning into High Hold pass.
<br><br>
When you zone into High Hold Pass you have a major advantage. Like the Greater Faydark, this entire area is considered a City Zone and you may bind anywhere you like. For starters I recomend binding when you zone if possible and then rebinding at the other end. If you don't have a caster with you and are doing this solo, /shout for a bind at the entrance to High Hold Keep.
<br><br>
Now for the fun part about this zone. You just zoned into a demiliterized area. Both ends of this pass are under siege. If you have just zoned in from kithicor, you are on the "orc side". Normally its camped, but sometimes you'll get unlucky. Run straight through and don't stop. Don't worry, you will pass High Hold Citizens and guard who will lay into your train with gusto. Run
forward out of the orc area, turn left, cross the bridge, go up the steps and turn left again. Now, you will be going down a gradual slope, go straight, then turn right and follow the valley. If you made a wrong turn you will wind up either on the Gnoll Side (leads into East Karana), or The Golden Rooster (a Local bar). Back track a little and try to bear right, you will come to a large stone building with guards in front,  this is the entrance to High Hold Keep. HHK has a bank if you want to leave your belongings or any loot you have aquired.
<br><br>
Once you bound, make your way to the Gnoll side, again run straight on through, and zone into East Karana. You will appear at the top of "the gorge" at the bottom of which leads into Runneye. Running down the gorge with SoW will take a good 5 minutes... its a big gorge. Once your at the bottom make a sharp left and follow the zone wall, keeping an eye out for Lions, Gorge Hounds, Crag spiders and reavers. The odd Hill Giant and Broon will sometimes show up here as well. Once you make it to the river you are pretty much home free. Follow the river
till you see a bridge and cross it.
<br>
JUMP TO: You are now in North Karana.
<br><br>
<b>The Low Road</b>
<br>
Starting from East Freeport, get bound and hopefull SoW'd.  From here run straight out through the Newbie zone to N Ro.
<br><Br>
Zoning into North Ro, turn left and follow the beach, evil races avoid the barbarians. Follow the Ocean to the Oasis of Marr.
<br><br>
In the Oasis of Marr you just keep on following the ocean, but actually have to start looking around for Sand Giants and the odd Spectre or Dry Bone. When you reach the end of the beach there is an orc camp, go around this and then move up to the zone wall and follow this to the right, and zone into South Ro.
<br><br>
Once in South Ro, if you are still blessed with SoW, run directly across the zone, ignoring everything and when you hit the wall turn right and then left into the pass to the Innothule swamp. If you are NOT blessed with SoW, do not pass go and Collect... oh wait. Turn right and follow the zone wall. You will go past one derv camp and 2 orc camps, but these are easily avoided, and then zone into Innothule.
<br><br>
Innothule. Turn right, turn left at the corner, then zone into the Feerott. Easy as that.
<br><br>
Feerott. If your an evil race you may want to consider turning right, binding in Oggok, the coming out of oggok, turning right, running past the small undead (skeletons and zombie) camps to the Rathe Mountain Zone pass. Otherwise turn left, and follow the wall, swim across the river. Here is the most dangerous part of Feerott. You will have to run across the bottom of the ramp to Cazic Thule. This isn't dangerous becuase of lizard men, its dangerous becuase the Feerott is the ogre Newbie zone, and Bouncer's Hurd and Flerb will occaisonally
partol through this area. If you can sneak, Camo, or invis, do so! Praying doesn't hurt either. If make it past here, hug the temple wall, swim across the next fork and follow the zone the rather mountain line. There is a cave full of spectres along this wall, however they won't chase you unless you go inside. The problem of course is that sometimes higher level people will leave their mess on the zone wall. Don't stop for nothing. There is one point where you will pick up 2 newbie skeletons. Nothing can be done about them, run a ways then kill them and zone into Rathe Mountains.
<br><br>
The Rathe is a great high level zone, but for running through its annoying. When you zone in, run straight up the alley, sticking to the right side wall. DO NOT MAKE ANY TURNS. Stay up on the walls because Cyclops and Hill Giants patroll the alley. When you get to the bug momument (its vaguely egyptian
looking and has a bunch of giant scarabs with egyption-esq names) bear into the right fork, hugging the left side wall. Evil races, beware the Innkeepers when you see the houses and stay HIGH up on this wall. Once past them the wall will end, run across to the next wall and turn left. This will take you to the lake rathe zone.
<br><br>
Lake Rathe. This is the worst part of the trip. Swimming. Swim across the Lake till you reach to Gnoll Camp (easiest way is to bear to the right and avoid any camps that are aggro to you). Watch out for swimming froglok's and sharks. This zone is also good becuase of the Arena, as you can bind inside it and should as for most good people running this way this is your only bind point
along the trip. Run past the Gnoll Encampment in the daytime if possible, at night time higher level undead including Dry Bones spawn in this spot.
<br><br>
Zone through into South Karana. SK is gonna be a challenge, simply becuase it is so large. Run forward till you see the aviak village, then bear to the left. When you see the hills and spire of Splitpaw, straighten out again until you see the undead camp. Go around this and bear to the right slightly and you will arrive at the bridge to North Karana. If you get lost, shout to the zone
for a /loc of the North Karana bridge, someone will tell you. JUMP TO You are now in North Karana.
<br><br>
<b>You are now in North Karana</b>
<br>
Turn left and follow the River, running past the white marble bridge that leads to South Karana. If you are zoning up from South karana and are an evil race, jump off the bridge, swim to the shore on the left and follow the river. Only danger along the river is a bunch of raiders who are easily seen and avoided. The river will lead you into West Karana.
<br><br>
In West karana the river is a nice boring run, for evil races keep an eye out for farmers as they sometimes stand along its banks. Run down the river till you see houses. Evil Races: This is a barbarian village, skirt around this widely, the cut left again sharply as if you were still following the river to the zone wall, and follow the zone wall, this will keep you away from all Queynos Guard towers and take you directly to the pass leading into Queynos
Hills. Good races can run through and then cut up to the path, past the Guard Towers and then simply make left turns on the path which will lead you to Queynos Hills.
<br><br>
Qeynos Hills: Evil Races will have their hardest challenge here. A partolling gaurd will sometimes walk down the pass to the zone area, then turn around and walk back. If you see him, zone out and see if you can get an invis, zone back in and run down the pass. Just before the guard tower there is a small pass on the left which will lead you into the Q Hills newbie zone. Get in here, and get close to the city so that you can be bound. The get the heck out of dodge! Beware every NPC in Q Hills, as all guards, Holly Windstalker and others will actively seek you down. Good races can follow the same path, but without worrying about the guard, taking the extra time to laugh at the ogre running screaming through the zone to Black Burrow.
<br><br>
Congratulations, your now in Qeynos.

There is another route from Freeport to Qeynos.  You can go from FP through the commons, through Kithicor, Rivervale, Mistythicket, Runnyeye, Beholders Maze, into the Karanas. This is more zones, but may be a little safer for lower level characters if you always stay right in runnyeye and the beholders maze, and try to stay high in the maze, careful sharp turns will cause you to fall.  This route may actually be faster than the one through Highpass Hold, not sure.<br><br>

One other glitch in the map: Beholder's Maze and Gorge of King Xrobb are one and the same zone, only different names for it. Second the map not always shows the zone exits on the right sides of the zone, e.g. the zone to Blackburrow in Qeynos Hill is on the east side, not on the north side. Don't know if this is intentional due to visibility purposes or just a bug.<br><br>

Two things i noticed about this map.  One is that the Nektulos Forest entrance is the East Commonlands, directly across from the tunnel. Also West Freeport and East Freeport need to be switched.  The boat is in East Freeport and you zone into the East commons from West Freeport.
