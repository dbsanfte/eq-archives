<b>Description</b><br>
This item is created through use of the smithing skill.  Only dwarves may craft this item and it must be forged in the Stormguard Forge located outside Redfists Metal in South Kaladim.  If you try it on a normal forge, or if any other race attempts to create it, you unfortunately will fail.  Combine the following items in the Stormguard Forge to create the Dwarven Plate Breastplate.
<br><br>
<li> Small Plate Breastplate Mold
<li> Dwarven Smithy Hammer
<li> Earthern Temper
<li> Leather Padding
<li> Brellium Chain Jointing 
<li> Folded Sheet of Brellium x3
<br><br>
To create the Folded Sheet of Brellium, you will need to first combine three Large Bricks of Brellium and some Dwarven Ale in the Stormguard forge.  Both items can be purchased from merchants, or if you choose you can brew the Dwarven Ale yourself.  Once combined it will create a Block of Brellium.  The next step is to combine a Dwarven Smithy Hammer, Dwarven Ale and a Block of Brellium in the forge to create the Folded Sheet of Brellium.  The dwarven smithy hammer can be purchased from Bloarn Norkhitter who can be found near the mines near the Bank.  The small plate visor mold can be purchased from Tortuk Everhot who can be found at the Everhot Forge in Kaladim.
<br><br>
To create the Brellium Chain Jointing you will have to combine a File, Dwarven Ale, Dwarven Smithy Hammer and a Brellium Ring.  All the items can be purchased in Kaladim, except the Brellium Ring, which must be forged.  Combine a Large Brick of Brellium, File and a Dwarven Ale to create it.
<br><br>
To create the Earthern Temper, it requires you to use the Brewing Skill.  You must combine Dwarven Ale, Lava Rock and two Drops of Mercury in a Brew Barrel.  The lava rock is dropped by Fire Elementals which can be found in various zones, Skyash Drakes from the SkyFire Mountains, and Fire Giants which live in Lord Nagafen's Lair.  This item will become trivial to brew at skill 135.</td>
