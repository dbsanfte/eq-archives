<b>Description</b><br>
This item is found off Najena, a level 30 Necromancer who spawns in the dungeon Najena.  She drops the Flowing Black Robe as common loot and the Black Tomb with Silver Runes as rare. 
<br><br>
Najena's door is locked so you will either need a thief to pick to the lock or find they key to open the dungeon, which I believe is dropped by Drelzna. A group of around level 25's should be able to hold the Najena's room.
<br><br>
This item also is dropped by the Froglok Tactician who can be found in Lower Guk.  He is a tough mob to camp. You will need a high level group of around 45th level to keep this spawn under control. He drops the Platinum Tiara as his rare and the Black Tomb with Silver Runes as his common.
<br><br>
Note: This item can only be equipped in the primary hand.
