Congratulations to Nazran of the Prexus server, the winner in our GeForce2 graphics card drawing! Nazran has two days to respond to my e-mail or I'll have to pick another winner. Last contest I had to pick 3 winners before someone would finally take the thing off my hands :) Thank you to everyone who entered a price in the last two weeks, we had over 2000 new price entries which greatly improved the price database. I hope everyone will continue to enter new prices and I may even hold another contest in the future.
<br><br>
Update: Nazran responded to my e-mail in about 2 minutes, he'll be upgrading from a TNT 2 Ultra card! :)<br>

Submitted by: <a href="mailto:niteraven@eqmaps.com">NiteRaven</a> on Friday, August 3rd at 02:13am EST<br>
<br>
Printable versions of items now match the new format with the option to print with comments. I recommend printing in grey scale or you'll be wasting a lot of blue ink. I also slightly redesigned the price details page to match the rest of the site, it looks a bit cleaner now.
<br><br>
I ordered the GeForce2 graphics card last night, just in time! The contest ends in two days, so now is the time to enter if you haven't already. If you know the price that an item sold for please enter it. A few minutes of your time will go a long way to helping someone else out and maybe win you a nice graphics card at the same time. Thanks to everyone who has entered so far!<br>

<br>
Starting today July 20th until August 5th, 2001 EQ Maps will be holding another drawing for a <a href="http://www.3dblaster.com/products/annihilator2/" target="_blank">Creative Labs</a> GeForce2 GTS graphics card! Submissions for the drawing will be in the form of valid price entries on any item. To submit a price simply look up the item you know the price of, click "Price Details", scroll to the bottom and add a price. The more prices you enter, the better chance you have to win!
<br><br>
Price entries will be monitored by myself and I encourage everyone to report bogus prices. If an obviously bogus price is found, ALL of your price entries will be deleted. You MUST enter your e-mail address if you want to win, otherwise I cannot contact you. The winner will be randomly selected and announced on August 6th. The GeForce2 will be shipped to their door the very same day.
<br><br>
The reason I'm doing this is to encourage everyone to add more prices to the database. To keep the database fresh with new prices and as accurate as possible. This is a small gift I can give back to you, the EQ Maps fan. Thank you!<br>
<br>

Well I decided that I had slacked off enough and it was time to add all those missing sets of smithing, tailoring, and tinkered items to our database.  I have completed the following sets of armor: Northman Ringmail, Imbued Northman Ringmail, Teir'Dal Chainmail, Enchanted Teir'Dal Chainmail, Imbued Teir'Dal Chainmail, Teir'Dal Adamantite, Imbued Teir'Dal Adamantite, Enchanted Dwarven Plate, Imbued Dwarven Plate, Imbued Enchanted Dwarven Plate, Clockwork Watchman, Koada'Dal Mithril, Imbued Koada'Dal Mithril, Enchanted Koada'Dal Mithril, Elven Chainmail, Imbued Elven Chainmail, Enchanted Elven Chainmail, Seafarer's Ringmail, Imbued Steelsilk, Imbued Mithril Studded, Ogre Splintmail, Ogre Imbued Splintmail, Imbued Ogre War Plate, Cabilis Scale, Enchanted Cabilis Scale, Field Plate, Imbued Field Plate (all 7 versions), Full Plate, and Enchanted Full Plate Armor.
<br><br>
Some of the above armor sets are currently lacking descriptions and recipies but those will be added this coming week once I get a bit more time.  Needless to say my hand hurts right now, so I'm gonna stop typing.  Enjoy :P<br>

<br>
After many hours of tweaking, I believe the way items are now displayed looks much better then before. It's a bit cleaner and gives more room to items with a large boost, race, and class list.
<br><br>
With any new interface it may take a while for the brain to adjust, but give it a try. I'd like to hear your comments and suggestions, since based on those I will keep it or switch back to the old one. I'll also be adjusting the printable version to match the new format.<br>

<br>
The new sections for the Artifacts and items handed out during GM Events can be found on the left, under the special drop down menu.  I've wanted to add this section for a long time now and finally had some free time.  I'm hoping that it will be like a hall of fame for all those unique or super rare items that exist in the world of Norrath.  For those that have received special artifacts or gm quest rewards, send me an email of what the event was about and I'll add it to the description.  On another note I've added the Expendable, and No Rent tags to items.  I'll be updating our database to reflect these changes.  Expect some more surprises in the near future.
<br><br>
I would also like to thank Aurelio Silverdawn from the Solusek Ro server for all the item updates, screenshots and corrections he's sent in, it has helped me tremendously in getting this database up to date.  Thanks :)<br>

I recently upgraded the backend database used for EQ Maps from MySQL 3.22.32 to 3.23.39. What does this mean to you? Well thanks to the newly implemented Full Text Search abilities of MySQL: faster and more accurate search results! Taking advantage of this new feature I was able to create a new <a href="search.php3">search script</a> in a matter of a few hours. Once again you can quickly and easily search through the Item, NPC, Landmark, Zone, and Spell tables. While I have done extensive testing, let me know if you run across any problems.<br>

<a class="headline" name="257">Recent Patch</a><br>
Submitted by: <a href="mailto:darnavian@eqmaps.com">Darnavian</a> on Tuesday, July 3rd at 08:21pm EST<br>
<br>
With the recent patch that went in last week, there were numerous updates to <a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/zone.php3?tag=vlab">Velketor's Labyrinth</a> and <a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/zone.php3?tag=toveeshan">Temple of Veeshan</a> items.  A lot of these items have gotten major overhauls including the <a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/zone.php3?tag=toveeshan&item=4889">Chestplate of Fiery Might</a> (AC60), the <a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/zone.php3?tag=drakkal&item=4660">Breastplate of Eradication</a> (AC55), and the <a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/zone.php3?tag=toveeshan&item=4675">True Mithril Breastplate</a> (AC57).  I've been busy updating them all, but if you notice anything wrong please email me.   
<br><br>
I've also been busy working on all the new items coming in from <a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/zone.php3?tag=befallen">Befallen</a> as it was recently upgraded to a mid level range dungeon.  Some of these new items are pretty good for mid level characters, including some 10/30 weapons and some nice new armor.  My mail box is nearly empty, which is weird, so keep sending in those screenshots of npc's and new equipment that you notice we are missing in our databases.  A final note, the GM section will be added shortly after I finally fix a piece of code that's been bugging me.  <br>
<br>

Well it seems as if things have finally calmed down a bit on the equipment front.  Not many new items have been submitted this last week, so it's given me a bit of time to focus on tiding up our databases here at EQmaps.  This week I spent some time checking every quest item in our database to make sure that it had a corresponding level, a complete description and I made sure that it would pop up when performing a quest search.
<br><br>
I was also able to update our NPC database with all the new creatures that have been appearing throughout the lands of Norrath, and all the ones we had missing.  I have also spent some time organizing the items handed out during GM Events.  I hope to have them organized under their own special drop down list on the left, and as well have an option under the advanced item list so that they won't pop up while doing searches for regular equipment.  These items will be in more of a hall of fame, as most of them are unique and very difficult to obtain.<br>

I know the news has been slow lately, we continue to work on adding things in the background as always. I've recently become extremely addicted (again) to a game I last played nearly four years ago. The game? <a href="http://www.meridian59.ru/" target="_blank">Meridian 59</a>, the FIRST 3D massively multiplayer online role playing game. Currently a FREE (donations appreciated) server is being run out of Russia (client is English) that seems fairly fast with a great community. If you have any questions I'll be playing as NiteRaven.
<br><br>
Anyways, back to the big news more EverQuest and EQMaps related. Tsigo and I have been working very hard the last few days trying to finish up the spells database Darnavian started a long time ago. I'm very close to getting the spells imported into the database and will have it done by the end of the day. This should answer those "what does that effect do" questions and will also provide a quick search function to access the spells.<br>

<a class="headline" name="254">Nice addition to the Advanced Item List</a><br>

After receiving numerous e-mails offering suggestions on how to improve the <a href="itemlist.php3">Advanced Item List</a>, I decided it's about time we made some improvements in the script. From now on, after you've completed a search, you may select any items that you wish to list in a stat-by-stat comparison. This new feature is available to everyone, including those not subscribed to <a href="http://www.flashlink.com/index.php?s=1">Flashlink</a>. Expect more additions to this and other scripts soon.<br>
