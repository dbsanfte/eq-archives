<b>Description</b><br>
GETTING STARTED:<br>
Hail Evah Xokez (the evil Cleric guildmistress) in the Necromancer guild. She will ask you if you find the rust and disease in the mines pleasing. Say "I find it pleasing" and she will tell you that you have the potential to become a loyal follower of Bertoxxulous. She will then ask you if you are [willing to learn] the ways of Bertoxxulous. Say "I am willing to learn" and she will give you part 1 of the quest.
<br><br>
PART 1:<br>
Your first task is to infect a pregnant rat in Steamfont with the plague rat disease so that she will pass it on to her bretheren and those she encounters. The "a female rat" is a new mob type in Steamfont, and very grouchy (maybe she's PMSing? hehe). She is about lvl 9 and will attack ANYTHING that comes near her. You WILL need a person that can Charm, and hopefully Track her down, as she is wandering and Steamfont is a very confusing place. Once Charmed, give her the vial. She will disappear, you will get the quest-bell sound, and find an empty vial in your inventory to give back to Evah for Part 2.
<br><br>
PART 2:<br>
Upon returning the vial, Evah will give you a container and instruct you to go collect reagents so that she can mix another batch of plague rat disease. She will want you to gather two Diseased Bone Marrow, one Gnomish Spirits, and one Sprig of Wormwood. First, the Diseased Bone Marrow is a semi-rare drop off of "brittle skeleton"s that roam Steamfont, especially the valley west of the windmills. The Gnomish Spirits, for those of you that don't know, are a beer and can be bought in the bar inside the Zoo building. Lastly, the Sprig of Wormwood is obtained by finding Enixxy Frennor in Steamfont. Follow the aforementioned valley to the west of the windmills that the skeletons hang out in and then hug the wall along your right side coming out of the valley.  You should see Enixxy. She IS a merchant, and DOES sell Wormwood, but not the kind you want. Her stuff is also, by the way, mostly junk. Don't waste your money buying any of it. Ask her "what about wormwood" and she will give you the Sprig of Wormwood. Combine your four items in the box, give it back to Evah and you have completed the quest! Congratulations!!
<br><br>
IMPORTANT NOTE: You MUST do Part 1, as the only way to obtain the container for Part 2 is to turn in the vial from Part 1.
