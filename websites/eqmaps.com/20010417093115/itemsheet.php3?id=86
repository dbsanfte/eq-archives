<b>Description</b><br>
Talk to Byzar Bloodforge who can be found in the Warriors Guild in Kaladim.  He asks if you'd be willing to take a little trip, and if you say you will, he goes on to tell you about Trumpy Irontoe.  He says he doesn't know where Trumpy is, but that he had been engaged to his sister and ran off on her.  He wants him dead for this dishoner to the family name and promises to make you an honorary member of the Bloodforge Brigade for returning the head.  
<br><br>
Trumpy Irontoe can be found at the Fish's Ale, a bar in South Qeynos.  The best way to kill Trumpy is to wait for him to wander out of the bar.  If you charge in and attack, there are a couple of other npc's that will aid Trumpy.  Attack Trumpy when he is far enough away from the bar, make sure that you can root/snare him as if he runs, lots of problems can arise.  Kill Trumpy and loot his head and bring it back to Byzar to receive the Bloodforge Hammer.  
<br><br>
Note: You now need good faction to complete this quest.  Talk to Byzar and ask him about the beads.  If he responds to you, then your faction is high enough.  If not, go and kill some more orcs, and goblins.
