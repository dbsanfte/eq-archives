              <tr><td colspan="3"><b>Description</b><br>
Unrest is quite possibly one of the deadliest zones in the games, due to its volitale nature and the composition of its Inhabitants. Being almost universally populated with undead it is very popular with Clerics and Paladins.  Druids and Shaman's are also in high demand as this is considered an "outdoor" zone, and SoW is a very precious commodity.
<br><br>
This area is billed as 15-35, this is something of a mis-nomer. The true "optimal" levels for this zone are 10-14, working the two rear corners and the gazebo killing lawntrash (Death Beetles, Tormented Dead,
and perhaps even the odd ghoul) and then 20-35+. After 35th xp will slow down, however it is possible to push the basement all the way to 40th.
<br><br>
What makes this zone dangerous is that it works in such a way that is quite contrary to most other dungeon areas. Many dungeon areas will have Fighter Types, Healer Types, and a few odd nasty Hybrid Melee types. So there will be a balance of healing power, less offensive power, and straight damage dealt with.
<br><br>
Unrest on the other hand is geared with totally offense driven NPC's. The Death Beetles on the lawn will actively attack any PC under 20th level engaged in combat with anything in the zone. Many of the NPC's inside the mansion will be magic only to affect, Ghouls, Mummies, Dry Bones, Barbed Bones will all have "special effects" in the form of roots, disease, damage shields or DD spells. These are not to be discounted, as many a group has seen there puller's health bar suddenly dissapear when a root hit them and they were quickly pummeled to death. Also are the strong melee type undead the Dark Bones, Greater Dark Bones and Skeletal Monks. Obviously the skeletal monks are the worst of the lot. Adding further flavor to this are the "Hags of Unrest" who are mid twenties Wizards and will universally cast massive DD spells including the high powered Shock of Force. The "Nobles of Unrest" found in the bar are divided, with males being melee and females being casters.
<br><br>
And this is just the standard fare to be found in the first 3 floors of the mansion. I have deliberately made no mention of the special NPC due to the fact they are special. This is not a spoiler, mearly a
commentary.
<br><br>
Pulling from the house is considered the standard method and is where most problems begin. With so many volatile NPC's ready to go off on a hair trigger trains are constant and deadly. Always try to have someone on "lookout" keeping an eye on the other parties around you. If you hear someone stating their intention to pull the tower or bar, move away from where ever it is they are pulling to. These area's are especially
difficult and dangerous to pull.
<br><br>
The next area to contend with is the basement. This is where the TRULY foul npc's are. Hags, Werebats, Greater Dark Bones are the common fair down here, with some flavor thrown in with Mortuary Fungus or the Dwarven Spirit. If you see either of these run, do not walk, to the zone as quickly as possible, they are both quite powerful.
<br><br>
There are significant pathing and aggro issues within the house itself, with several rooms on the second and basement area causing aggresive responses in rooms next to, or in some cases ABOVE the room you intend to pull from. Oddly enough becuase of all of this, the best time (read safest) to hunt this place is when it is most crowded as the spawn will be much more controlled. At this point groups will start moving into the major spawn areas and camping inside the house or basement, which is much safer than pulling while the lower 20's people deplete the other spawns with pulls.
<br><br>
Awareness is the key, also realize that you will cause trains when you fight here no matter how noble your intentions. I do not recommend working this zone until over 25th level as the damage dealt out is both massive and fast. Many will argue this point with me I am sure, however I see more of 18-22 corpses strewn about the zone and calling "Train to Zone" than I see 28-32 bodies.

<br>
<br>
1. Assesmble  at the bookshelf(secret door) thats at the top of the stairs that lead to the Basaement.<br>
2. Kill the 2 or 3 Mobs that are at the foot of the stairs.<br>
3, IVU everyone and run, hugging the left wall,  through the torture room, through the false wall, past one mob, and down to the corner which has a little bench you could sit.<br>
4. Kill all of the spawns you see, dont go past the bloodpool yet. Always run through the bloodpool!! traps are there otherwise which you could pull the mobs from, if you wanted to, one at a time, the left one then the right one.<br>
5. With the two tanks leading go throught the bloodpool, and down the halway to the next mob, Kill it!!<br>
6. Dont walk on the wooden pathway!!<br>
7. Have the two tanks kill the spawn the it in the hallway that goes off to the right down to Ghost room. Kill it on the spot!!<br>
8. Heal up, med up, and then prep for the charge to the ghost which sit in the back left corner of the room.<br>
9. CHARGE!! All members rush in and go strait for the ghost. Save nukes till his life is 2/3 gone. Dont forget to kill em. There will also be a Tenticle Terror there, he and the ghost are buds. Kill it. The room should be clear after that.<br>
-={POINTS TO PONDER}=-<br>
- 21min spawn in the whole basement.<br>
- always fight terrors with your back against the wall<br>
- You'll be lucky if there isn't a high level there farming the spawn<br>

Paly's are Undead Killers - as Holy Knights we are duty bound to send the estates entire inhabitants back to thier ungodly world and out of ours!<br>
<br>
I came to the estate at lvl 16 and, allowing for several excursions to other parts of Norrath, have stayed there to see myself to lvl 31.<br>
<br>
You start on the front lawn at lvl 10 and move to the basement until lvl 35, maybe 40.<br>
<br>
The loot is good. Fine Steel abounds and sells for 2 to 5 plat a piece. Throw in the Small Bronze Armour,Tasarin's Grimoire pages, Words, Runes, etc and the general loot alone makes good selling. In addition many rarer items, that only come off specific NPC's, such as the Blood Stained Tunic and Mantel, Dwarven Work Boots, festering Cloak etc give you loot that can fetch up to 300pp easily.<br>
<br>
The downside is that it's as dangerous as hell itself! I must have died here 20 times and it happens quickly! At lvl 30 I can work the 1st floor picking off individual spanws, invis - med - heal then onot the next. But no way will you get a room and hold it on your own. I tried that! Get a good group and your laughing!<br>
<br>
So here's my nuggets of knowledge:<br>
1. You WILL pull trains to the zone :-) Don't worry about it, if you hear 'TRAIN to zone' get out of the way and don't take any grief from people whineing about your trains!<br>
<br>
2. Watch out for Aqua Gobs when swimming across DC<br>
<br>
3. Take several stacks of food and water - they sell for 10 to 20pp :-)<br>

She is a high-elf NPC.  This is in connection with the Mystic Cloak quest, and the only reason I knew of the priest or this NPC is because I want this cloak :)  Hope that helps!<br><br></td></tr>

Gee, kinda makes sense. UNDEAD, most of which are, er... uneasy...<br><br></td></tr>

  <tr><td colspan="3" bgcolor="#13273C" class="c1">I am a 25th Lvl Enchantress and was succesfully single pulling out the back door of the estate.  I found that if I had wolf form (luckily there were a few highbies who needed a breeze) I could go in the backdoor and pull from the big room right on the 2nd floor up the back stairs.  The trick was scoping out all the green ghouls and such and messing them with enthrall.  I would mes each and every mob along the path that I intended to pull.  Then in the 2nd floor room I would mes one mob and the other would pull.  When all the messes broke the mobs would mem blur (I love enthrall) and not come running out the door after me.  I was even pulling for a ranger I was with... very ironic... but it was working great.  Anyways good luck there and run if you here the word train :)<br><br></td></tr>

He did something and summoned a very powerful force (maybe angered the gods or something not sure) and this force created dagnor's caudron and also cursed the land of the house to the control of the undead. Obviously i don't know any specifics but this is what i've been able to put together so far. I'm hoping to figure out more soon.<br><br></td></tr>

  <tr><td colspan="3" bgcolor="#13273C" class="c1">Yesterday, my group was hunting out in the back, with me pulling from inside of the house.  I was the highest level(21), with levels down to 17.  We had 3 clerics in our group, 2 tanks, and a druid.  I got an invis to undead from a cleric, went to the 2nd level to grab a carrion ghoul or something, and came back with a yellow monk and a cg, which we took easily, but I had grabbed so much yard trash... We were attacked by about 10 beetles and a few random tormented deads after the monk and cg were dead, and two of the clerics and the secondary tank ended up dying, purely to yard trash.  All that I could figure was that I couldn't get the beetles off of the clerics, and that the other tank must have aggroed too many, which caused hi s death and then the clerics'.  It was a major lesson that we all had to learn : Yard trash isn't a joke when in big numbers!<br><br></td></tr>
