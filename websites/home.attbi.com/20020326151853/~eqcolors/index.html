        <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">I'd like to take this 
          time to announce a <b>new feature</b> named <b>SpeedEQ</b>, what this 
          feature does, is analyze EverQuest in the background, it monitors RAM 
          and Hardrive usage, login and zone load times, it even enumerates threads 
          and their pull (processor usage), then generates a very thorough report 
          with performance charts, it then suggests settings to make EverQuest 
          run optimally for your particular computer, this includes changes to 
          operating system settings, bios, and various other things on all Windows 
          98se/2000/XP based systems, this feature is a &quot;must-have&quot; 
          for any serious EverQuest player.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2"><b>It's official, 
          I've made my decisions on several issues regarding the program:</b></font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">1.) <b>EQcolors</b> 
            will now be known as <b>TweakEQ</b>; the functionality of this program 
            has gone far beyond a simple eqclient.ini editor, it has many new 
            advanced system-level features, that you would only expect to find 
            in high-quality commercial configuration tools.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">2.) The program 
            will be <b>initially privatized</b>, meaning that I will not release 
            it to the public when it's finished, &quot;which is very soon pending 
            the Bazaar UI addition in EverQuest&quot;, I simply haven't decided 
            what I want to do with the program yet, I know it's being used by 
            a rather large population of EverQuest players, but I get very little 
            feedback from them.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2" color="#999999">Happy 
          New Years everybody! my attention has been very divided with multiple 
          side-projects lately, but the more I play with EQcolors 3.0, the more 
          I envy it's slick interface and functionality, you can safely assume 
          by what I've said here, that the program is in functional condition 
          right now, I'm at a stage where I'm playing more with the program than 
          working on it, I really need to stop that and start focusing on finishing 
          the program!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2" color="#999999">If 
          you want to see one of the &quot;other&quot; side-projects that's been 
          eating up my sparetime, visit <a href="http://home.attbi.com/%7Eeqmaximus/brell/">The 
          Brell Serilis Nexus</a>, also I need to finish the design for this site 
          as well, what you see here was thrown together with one of my renderings, 
          I was going to save that for the launch of EQcolors 3.0, so what do 
          you think, should I just release it as a Beta? or go through it with 
          a fine tooth comb to make sure it's absolutely stable like I did with 
          version 2.0? ;)</font></p>

        <P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2" color="#999999">I'm 
          currently working on the 'Optimizations' and 'Advanced' features of 
          EQcolors 3.0, it's coming along very well with no bugs that have surfaced, 
          however, testing the memory overhead of EQ with different settings is 
          quite time consuming. </font></P>
        <P><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2" color="#999999">I 
          have several projects going on at once, but EQcolors 3.0 is on the top 
          of my priority list, it's by no means a simple upgrade, it is a major 
          new release that will make version 2.0 obsolete, and I strongly believe 
          that people will use nothing else once it is available.</font></P>

          you like to leave feedback? or have any suggestions for features you

          I'm toying around with a new design, and I'll be working in menus for
