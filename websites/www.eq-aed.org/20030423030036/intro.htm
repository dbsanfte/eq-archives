				Welcome to the website of Amiticia et Delectatio!! AeD is a guild formed of 
				friends both pre-EQ and formed through EQ. We are a small and very tight group. 
				We will not openly solicit for new members and we do not mass recruit. Our primary 
				purpose is to have fun!<br>
				
				&nbsp;<br>
				
				Currently, AeD exists on two servers - Ayonae Ro and Solusek Ro. If you are 
				interested in joining us, send a member a tell and make friends! Stop by our 
				message boards as well and say HI!<br>

				<i>The barbarian stood upon the frozen tundra gazing up at the chill night air.
				She was a traveller, she'd seen many sights in her more 65 seasons but
				none was more beautiful than the sight before her this eve. A crackling
				fire, a beacon of warmth amidst ice and snow and surrounding that fire was
				her family.<br>
				
				&nbsp;<br>
				
				They were not a family in the conventional sense, but those with whom she
				shared a common bond. They hailed from all walks of life, each with their
				own degree of skill and specialization but each with something that set them
				apart as a group; the heart of comeraderie. Their desire was not the riches
				of the land or to be the fastest and the strongest, but to share their time
				with those they called friend, in the spirit of companionship and fun.<br>
				
				&nbsp;<br>
				
				...thus the creation of Amicitia et Delectatio!<br></i>
