      afternoon...I came across a post about &quot;where rangers stand&quot; and &quot;why pick 
      a ranger&quot;...ranger bashing etc...everyone saying we deal less damage than 
      most damage melees yadda yadda....yet on my server, I have been sought 
      after (along with my ranger comrades) for everything since Verant paid a 
      bit of attention to our needs. Although we could use a few more hit points 
      to warrant the taunt button, overall, the Warder has a DEFINITIVE niche in 
      both exp groups to help level his friends, and the REAL reason for myself 
      and many other high level rangers to play... the raid. Going to break this 
      down in a few ranks... the pre level 60 ranger for exp groups/small 
      raids...and the ranger at the pinnacle of his/her abilities...at level 60.

      <br>
      Rangers are one of the most versatile exp grouping classes in the game... 
      with amazing abilities if used in the correct hands. We all know that the 
      ranger is meant as a supplementary damage dealer, a protector of the 
      casters...a master of the outdoors zones for finding prey, and THE BEST 
      animal class hunter in the game. THIS is what you can bring to a group 
      during these awkward levels. <br>
      <br>
                        </font><b><font face="Verdana" color="#006666" size="1"><img border="0" src="http://www.angelflame.com/ranger/new/images/bullet4_space.jpg" width="14" height="8"></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#006666">Solid puller in outdoor zones</font></b><br>
      No class has our tracking range... the ability to find an exp giving 
      monster in the out of doors is unmatched... with the ability to cast 
      harmony before the pull to separate a single from a crowd, to FIND that 
      mob half a zone away...and bring it to the group on the PERFECT vector 
      (with the aide of tracking) is simply an amazing catalyst for a groups 
      exp. Find a mob, pull it...get it to the group...and if they can defeat 
      the mob without you ...GO GET ANOTHER ONE...snare the beast if it's too 
      close and the first one isn't defeated yet...and get it to the group just 
      as the last mob dies. This will keep the exp flowing....and in outdoors 
      zones where blue monsters might be sparse (or overpopulated zones), this 
      constant exp attack method will level your friends and YOU extremely fast.
      <br>
      <br>

      No matter how you try to explain it...fear kiting is a frighteningly 
      efficient means to solo. Rangers do this better than ANY CLASS versus 
      animals (which you can find blue all the way to 60..although very sparse 
      after 55). The ability to just buff, snare, fear, and melee a mob until 
      said fear drops... run a bit away, re fear rinse repeat... med for 2 
      minutes and go again... is just frightening. Panic animal is so strong I 
      was worried about the dewd aspect of the new rangers coming in...but for 
      the older rangers who are part timers or sparse playtimes... this ability 
      to go to Eastern wastes, Iceland, and Wakening lands is downright deadly. 
      Use your ability to fear kite and you won't NEED a group to get SOME 
      yellow bar... although you will find that a well balanced group is not 
      only more lucrative in the exp department... but fun as well. <br>
      <br>
      Duo ability with an enchanter unrivaled out of doors...fast EASY exp to 
      60. <br>
      Find the blue mobs with tracking...get buffed by your enchanter comrade... 
      and laugh as you duo mobs that are difficult for most warrior/cleric 
      combos to do in such rapid succession with invoke fear and ensnare. 
      Enchanters make rangers GODS everywhere but the HP department. The 
      combination of clarity II, gift of whatever for mana regen, WR, VOG, AQ, 
      Snake for haste, tepid deeds (or shiftless/forlorn on the mobs that hit 
      for 200 ish :P), chloro, slnature/diamond, ensnare and invoke fear 
      ...coupled with harmony pulling, gwolf form and you are SCREAMING with 
      attack power destroying a hapless running mob from behind. Adds are mezzed, and dealt with later...bedlam/berserker spirit keeps you from 
      getting chapped too badly...post combat gheals or just chloro...ranger 
      enchanter duos are unmatched... and if you find one you can bond with and 
      play with extensively... you can kill whatever you want for exp all the 
      way to 60 outdoors. <br>

      It has been said a million times on this board... how druids sometimes 
      don't use their spells to the fullest of their abilities... while the 
      ranger will make sure every last member has that famous level 15 spell... 
      feet like cat for the paltry agi/ac bonus LOL. You have buffs! USE THEM. 
      Many folks just don't realize the added bonus of a rangers buffs at these 
      levels....and later at 60 they allow a smaller raid to do what would 
      require at least 5 more tanks to accomplish. Rangers should use their 
      abilities to the fullest....damage shield the warrior! (especially if 
      relying on your Swarmcaller to slow the beasts... or that warrior's 
      truncheon at 4 am with no shaman/enchanter around). At 53, rangers have a 
      fantastic strength buff. Pass it around! Get your warrior to 255 STR and 
      that rogue over 200 STR... to maximize those big hitters/backstabs/flying 
      kicks. Couple Strength of Nature... the most underrated lower level buff 
      in the game. Get your group members attack rating UP... with LIQUID 
      NITROGEN attack (pure attack... not STR based) and they will hit much more 
      difficult monsters more effectively AND those paladins/SKS in your group 
      will be doing MUCH more damage because *bonk* they will actually hit 
      things that their attack might be too low to touch (ATK compared to ac of 
      target mob). Call of Earth is a WONDERFUL ac buff... with a damage shield 
      to boot. It's ac/mana ratio is GODLY folks....25 ac for 50 mana AND a 4 pt 
      dam shield? This is a buff that paladins, clerics, hell ANYONE can't touch 
      for that type of mana. This spell tears even the higher level ac buff of 
      enchanters apart...BUFF EVERYONE including those casters...make your 
      warrior tank better...make that rogue shrug off attacks in time to 
      evade...make the enchanter take 24 Dmg instead of 120. CHLOROPLAST is one 
      of THE most mana efficient spells out there to keep hit points up and 
      running. At level 55 (and beyond../weep half elf wisdom) this spell is 
      mana intensive... but at the very least keep that warrior buffed if he 
      doesn't have the advantage of regrowth from someone...and you WILL be able 
      to do much more than without. It's also wonderful to keep on yourself or 
      damage tanks because the cleric/druid/shaman wont have to splurge a heal 
      if your controlling your agro. <br>
      <br>

      Some folks will argue that the warrior is better for pure melee damage 
      equally equipped. This will ring true for a while to some extent... but as 
      you attain your epic weapons, there is a HUGE rift in what you can do. 
      I'll cover epic in the Warder section later... for now this is how you can 
      out damage EVERY warrior you ever meet. Rangers have dual wield... and 
      post 50 its a phenomenal use of our abilities...coupled with a swarmcaller 
      for the all powerful group friendly 50 percent slow...what a deadly 
      ability indeed. Although on the books...rangers have the same melee power 
      as a warrior...when you are performing your role you will find that you 
      will ALWAYS out damage that tanking warrior if you maneuver behind your 
      opponent (avoiding riposte/parry/dodge) and dig into the back of your 
      opponent. Couple this with jolt and you are *always* behind the mob, and 
      unless your warrior is an ogre (immune to bash based stuns from the front) 
      you will just destroy said tank in overall melee damage because he gets 
      stunned 2-3 times per mob. I have done tests with *another program* with 
      real time combat stats that prove this all through my career. Also, if you 
      move to the absolute limit of your range (you are well out of sword 
      range... but can still swing and hit...if you ever use the F9 pan views 
      you know what I mean) you can minimize the chance of the mob turning on 
      you. Equally equipped... no warrior will touch your damage potential... 
      and versus monks without epics, you will find your damage to eclipse 
      theirs (unless they are just getting REAMED for lack of feign tactics to 
      control agro) from the ability to make sure you are TEARING into your 
      opponent from the back. <br>
      <br>
                        </font><b><font face="Verdana" color="#006666" size="1"><img border="0" src="http://www.angelflame.com/ranger/new/images/bullet4_space.jpg" width="14" height="8"></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#006666">Combat spell selection....why your more valuable 
      in the exp group than the warrior in many instances</font></b><br>
      Rangers post 50 are akin to the enchanter in crowd control of MOVING, 
      ACTIVE MOBS. Enchanters keep the &quot;adds&quot; from attacking...they put them to 
      sleep while the party engages one mob at a time. The ranger however, can 
      totally CONTROL the mob under attack. Period. Using our spells and good 
      tactics...that mob is HOPELESSLY under our control until it dies (unless 
      its immune to magic /rude Verant heheh) and if said mob happens to be 
      immune to magic but not to fire, then we are still at half power in this 
      respect at level 55 with cinder jolt. 3 mobs come in at the chef room in
                        Sebilis...your level 55...party ranger warrior rogue enchanter cleric 
      shaman. Warrior engages a Krup warrior....the Krup wizard and Krup shaman 
      also engage him...you fire a snare at the /assist on the warrior and root 
      him afterwards. That mob is GLUED to the warrior...and you watch the 
      enchanter. The Krup wizard resists that first dazzle... and he's on the 
      enchanter. The cleric counters with level 5 stun to try to preserve the 
      following mez attempt (level 5 stun=0 Dmg... so if its late it wont break
                        mez) while you snare him... to get yourself some agro. The enchanter is 
      interrupted and fires a PBAE stun (hey that shaman and wizzy are pissed) 
      but stunned...the enchanter fires a dazzle on the wizard again... 
      resist... <br>
      <br>
      at this point if you were a warrior the group might be in trouble...the 
      shaman passed out turgurs at this point but you are losing valuable mana 
      and slowing down the pulls unless the ranger takes matters into his own 
      hands... <br>
      <br>

      continues to attack the said mob from the back and watches the enchanter 
      drop to a bub...and keeps attacking the mobs trying to get the first mob 
      dead....it dies... and moves to the next mob direct assist on warrior. 
      That mob attacks the chanter continuously and either the chanter dies or 
      sucks tons of mana <br>
      <br>
                        </font><b><font face="Verdana" color="#006666" size="1"><img border="0" src="http://www.angelflame.com/ranger/new/images/bullet4_space.jpg" width="14" height="8"></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#006666">The good ranger</font></b><br>
      Fires off another snare on a mob on the enchanter...then targets the OTHER 
      mob on the enchanter and fires an ensnaring roots quickly (careful here... 
      it breaks mez) but then snares that mob after root holds and now YOU are 
      its target even if root breaks... guaranteed. Announce rooted and that mob 
      is out of the picture until the enchanter can get to it...attacking mobs 
      down to ONE on the chanter...9x out of ten your cleric will level 5 stun, 
      chanter pbae stun uninterrupted... and its mezzed. THEN make sure to snare 
      it AGAIN (great aggro inducer) and fire a taunt in close..&gt;&gt;THEN assist 
      the warrior. If your level 57 you can also fire a greater heal on the 
      enchanter to keep him up AND gain aggro pts. When the first mob is dead, 
      break mez with ROOT and I'm sorry there's no way he's on the 
      enchanter....and your casters are MEDDING instead of pissing mana into hp 
      bars...getting ready for the next pull... instead of saying OOM i need a 
      break :P <br>
      <br>
      No other melee class contributes to 'constant pull environment' like the 
      ranger. Period. The combination of snare, flamelick, immolate, ROOTs, and 
      our call spells/fast nukes will assure that no matter what the 
      circumstance....that mob is going to be upset with YOU if you so desire, 
      and you can deal some pretty hefty damage once the pull is in &quot;stasis&quot; or 
      all mobs either asleep or on the tank. <br>
      <br>
      Finally...rangers bring peace of mind in the event of having to run. If 
      you do your job and everything is snared almost immediately... if you 
      gotta jet you will not have to deal with the original pull at the very 
      least. We are the glue for an exp group...we control the runners... we 
      control the agro of the awake mobs. No other melee class can root, snare, 
      dump aggro points with a click of a mouse like a ranger....Keep your group 
      alive. <br>
      <br>
      No damage melee can double running speed, raise attack by 33, hp by 75, 
      STR by 35, hp regen by 10 per tic, ac by 25, (if no cleric/paladin/druid 
      cast sldiamond :P), damage shield for 16 (and later at 58, 21) for 
      EVERYONE, and still manage to snare runners, root park, jolt off aggro at 
      a whim (feign/evade have reuse time 3x that of jolt, albeit manaless) 
      showcasing a multitude of abilities in one HIGH DAMAGE melee machine. 
      Period. Make every xp group a showcase of what you can do...don't let 
      anyone forget that you have abilities far above any pure melee when the 
      S*** hits the fan. <br>
      <br>

      When the ranger reaches level 60, if played correctly there is no other 
      class that compares to its damage capabilities over the long haul versus 
      high end monsters, as long as they are affected by either magic or fire. 
      Couple this with the irreplaceable call of the predator on raids, the huge 
      enhancement of our epic weapons... and our unreal quest armors in 
      Velious...and you have an absolute BEAST of an asset to any exp group or 
      raid. <br>
      <br>
      Folks say that we barely out damage warriors at level 60 with triple 
      attack chances etc...on a raid that might well be true if said warrior 
      isn't tanking...yet with our epic weapons...we have something that 
      warriors don't. Innate 40 percent haste, RAW 54 attack bonus on our 
      Swiftwind...and pure attack buffs (STR of Nature, and Call of the 
      Predator) to enhance the abilities of the other hybrids/melees... and make 
      a DEFINITIVE impact on warriors taunt effectiveness. (higher pure Atk=higher hit ratio versus immense armor class opponents for EVERYONE) No 
      other class has this ability to enhance EVERYONE'S pure attack. Period. 
      Shaman can do ONE PERSON for a tiny amount of time... Avatar's duration is 
      pathetic, and later it will proc on your weapons. Rangers can make 
      Paladins and Shadow knights HURT UBER MoBs with melee... and make warriors 
      HIT often and HARD...keeping the taunt alive with proper tactics. NOBODY 
      does that but the ranger... period. <br>
      <br>
      We stay ALIVE the LONGEST of any melee class if played properly on things 
      like the Dain, Velketor, Yelinak, Vindicator, Statue of Rallos Zek 
      (ESPECIALLY THIS ONE heheh) etc. If it's a big ugly, hard hitting 
      mob....rangers have the ability to simply DESTROY them unmolested until 
      they are heaps on the ground. Rogues and Monks DO have the ability to 
      shrug aggro with Evade and feign respectively... but overall if jolt or 
      cinderjolt hit the mob... rangers will simply destroy them in aggro 
      management. Feign isn't cumulative aggro management... if said monk feigns 
      off the mob... he has to wait till someone else climbs the hate list 
      higher than he/she is...cutting damage output. Also feign has a reuse time 
      that's fairly high. Rogues CAN pre-evade... and it works very well. 
      However, that rogue CAN'T evade every 2 seconds...again the ability has a 
      re-use... and unless they turn off their attack... they WILL be 
      slaughtered ...and what if it fails? They have to wait MUCH longer...and 
      with 1100 hitting mobs...rogues wont last that long unless everything is 
      perfect (or they know when to back off). Rangers on the other hand...have 
      cumulative anti-hate that can be recast every 2 seconds (normal spell 
      delay) to push themselves SO LOW on the hate list they aren't touched once 
      IF the mob is properly debuffed. Also they have the ability to deal damage 
      from afar to begin with to allow TIME for the key debuffs to land on the 
      UBER MoBs (Tash, Malo, Breath of Ro, Ro's fiery Sundering, Ice, Malo for 
      example) with Trueshot. <br>
      <br>
      Rangers can and DO Trueshot in my guild...dealing obscene damage from afar 
      with albeit expensive but powerful arrows dealing VERY IMPRESSIVE damage 
      (though not rogue or monk ish) with almost no recourse whatsoever. When 
      the Trueshot fades...we have already dealt 5-9k versus an excruciatingly 
      HIGH LEVEL opponent (thanks to our obscene attack ...yes higher than any 
      rogue with full raid buffs unless that rogue plays with stacking issues or 
      has a Firefist ring from draco). No rogue will ever have greater wolf 
      form, predator, STR of nature, plus we match their pure attack on their 
      epic AND their epic 40 percent haste...only we can apply that to our bows 
      and slaughter mobs. THEN we can proceed to cinder jolt until it hits 6 
      times (the magic number versus most Velious ubers in my guild... depending 
      on how hard your melees hit it may be more or less) and close for melee 
      unadulterated ..staying behind the opponent, with cumulative anti hate 
      equivalent to minus 6 epic warrior procs on our previous damage...and then 
      throw in a cinder jolt every 6 seconds or so. Staying behind the mob we 
      aren't reposted on, we dig in with our huge attack...and as we watch our 
      damage tank comrades eventually add too much hate and die, we stand 
      stalwart dealing damage over the course of the 15 minute fight until the 
      mob is dead or we run out of mana and finally succumb to the hate list.
      <br>
      <br>
      I cannot remember a raid that predator /STR of nature wasn't asked for by 
      our Paladins /SKs, and at least predator on everyone else (divine STR is 
      nice :P). I also can't remember the last time I died with mana on a 
      Velious ubermob. Rangers are a difficult road, they have gotten much 
      easier as of late with the additions to our class. We have the ability to 
      augment a raid or exp group that is tank based so greatly...and just like 
      discovering how strong VOG is over the snake on raids for its 
      attack...predator and STR of nature is 87 net attack when its all said and 
      done on the meter. If played correctly you can assure that no matter exp 
      group or raid, small or large gathering...a ranger has its place. Play 
      well and folks will regard rangers as one of the best classes in the game. 
      Because we ARE.</font>
