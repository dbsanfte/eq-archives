            <p align="center"><font face="Verdana">Lets see... at level 1 Amanar
            was a real noob... he ran around Qeynos Hills being a half elf
            ranger and basically killed bats... to large bats... to large snakes
            to giant bats....all the way up to level 7.</font></p>

            7-15</font></b></p>
            <p align="center"><font face="Verdana">Now I was finally feeling
            confident in my ability to play the game, so my friend told me I was
            ready to go to Blackburrow now (dungeon near of Qeynos Hills.... One
            of my personal favorite zones still) at level 7 I fought mainly at
            the top just killing normal Gnolls, but then once I hit level 8 I
            got a group of 3 or maybe just a partner to fight giant snakes on
            the snake ledge.... And boy is it UBER loot, each fang gets you 4
            gold and each sack 4 gold... and half the snakes drop two! I
            partnered there till level 10 when I was able to solo them... but
            remember to snare them because they run off... but if a giant snake
            runs trust me let it run... it will be back.. if you chase it its going to
            run you into a lot of trouble. Level 12 I would find a group for
            either the green room or the clover room. These both have elite
            gnolls and commanders and even the clover has some refugee
            splitpaws. Get a good group of level 12s or so and your getting
            great experience! Besides they drop collars with 3 STR on them which
            I used till 45... and 2 AGI earrings and other good loot for the level.
            I hung around there till level 15 when I got my new spells.</font></p>

            <p align="center"><font face="Verdana">At level 15 I wondered around
            Oasis because I heard it was great experience... killed alligators
            with a friend. Wasn't bad but didn't have any loot... so once I leveled
            it was time to move on.</font></p>

            16-18</font></b></p>
            <p align="center"><font face="Verdana">At level 16 I got my first
            group at Highhold Pass. One camping the Gnolls. Was GREAT experience
            and can you believe it I rolled a perfect 100 on a PGT! (yup still
            remember) which I sold for 100 plat... man was that a good day. At level
            17 or so I also tried looking for Orc groups which give more
            experience... but things can get ugly its good to have some crowd
            control and a solid group. Good stuff drops their like the herbalist
            pack too.</font></p>

            18-30</font></b></p>
            <p align="center"><font face="Verdana">At lvl 18 well my friend told
            me he had been hunting in this... Lake of Ill Omen. Thought it
            sounded weird but he said it was great experience so I took the trip
            to Kunark... almost died by Drachnids before getting bound (note:
            get a SoW and camo yourself before journeying up the stream...)
            There I found groups on the shore hunting Sabretooth tigers and such
            for a couple levels... till 20. Level 20 I was able to get a group
            outside the Sarnak fort... ouch we were fighting red Sarnak
            recruits... but we took them down without too much harm and man what
            great experience! Did this till level 28... at level 22 or so when
            you get new spells its good to head inside the fort pull in there. Level
            28... well level 28 is when I began my career of leveling the same
            way I do now... soloing. Yes unlike Rainangel I soloed my later part
            of my career instead of my earlier. But man was this the best
            experience ever... and I mean literally haven't found better. Here's
            what you do. That panic animal spell you got at level 22...first it
            seems kinda worthless. But wait... go pull a Sabretooth Grimalkin to
            the shore... snare him... then cast panic animal. It costs 10 mana
            so keep refreshing it it won't waste too much, and while the animal
            is running, well just keep whacking! If it breaks step back some and
            refresh it. I did this all the way to level 30.</font></p>

            30-45</font></b></p>
            <p align="center"><font face="Verdana">Iceclad. I went to Iceclad...
            visited the gnome pirates... don't worry that bunch won't hurt ya
            they are quite funny. Began there by soloing cougars. Use the same
            method as on Sabretooth Grimalkins.... And man will you be raking in
            the experience. But that's not all, it wasn't just great
            experience... but every 50 or so drop a Cougar claw earring.. 4 AC
            3STR 2DEX. Worth about 250 plat on Vazaelle at the time... now worth
            more around 200. Well I was getting a level a day and 250 plat a
            day. I was RICH. Finally I could buy a lot of new gear I needed...
            Cougars lasted till 40. 40 was a hell level... trust me if you don't
            solo like me all the time... be good to yourself and SOLO hell levels.
            They go by much faster. So at 40 I went to the island with the
            dragon bridge and found a nice big ice patty to pull dire wolves to
            and fear kite them. Sure they didn't drop the nice loot but all I
            needed was experience... although green at 44, I managed to do them
            until 45 barely.</font></p>

            45-50</font></b></p>
            <p align="center"><font face="Verdana">Stumped as to where to find
            more things to solo, I ventured into Eastern Wastes. First I figured
            well let me track some blue animals, and I'll pull them to near the
            bridge and kite them... Well let me tell ya I was pulling BIG
            mammoths with tons of HP... pathing was bad... it just wasn't the
            awesome kiting I had done. So then I found a 53 ranger who lead a
            life of soloing just like me... and he said he had a GREAT spot. So
            he told me to go left from the bridge until you track Icefang...
            track him until you reach his hut. Right around the hut there are
            never any mobs so it's a safe med spot. Icefang is great experience
            up until level 52 or so I hear. At 45 he will be semi hard but just
            keep working on refreshing fear and he's nice, and then you usually
            can pull a blue walrus in between Icefangs. Note there is a Coldain
            ghost named Korrigain here who will assist icefang... but you can
            still pull him by targeting him and running off towards the fire,
            then pulling with snare from there... Korrigain won't aggro ya. If
            you have bad Coldain faction though they will scowl... so be aware.
            Well I have done them up until now... and still fight them a good
            bit when its time to do the exp grind. Hope this guide helps some
            young rangers get there way up in the ranks fast and discover how
            good rangers truly are in the end... although the beginning may be
            rough.</font></font>
