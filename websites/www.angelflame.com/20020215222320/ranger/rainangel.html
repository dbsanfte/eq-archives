                Ranger of the 39th Season. For most of her<img border="0" src="http://www.angelflame.com/ranger/images/rain.jpg" align="right" width="102" height="307"> early life, she
                solo'd. I did not start to really group until my Mid to Late
                20's. You do not have to play your Ranger this way, this was
                what I choose for her for many reasons. The guide below, is based on Rain and what I have
                learned in those 39 seasons... Well lets
                see... where to begin... I guess the beginning of Rainangel's
                life is as good a place as any...</i></font></p>
                <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rainangel started out her
                life in Kelethin as with any other Wood Elf. She slayed the bats
                and wasps in and around Greater Faydark and obtained a few
                levels. I would suggest to anyone creating and starting any type
                of Wood Elf, Be it Ranger or Druid, to head over to Rivervale
                and the great woods of Misty Thicket. I did not do this with
                Rainangel, but I did do this with my Paladin Skyeangel. In Misty
                Thicket you can easily obtain levels up to 10 quickly with the benefits
                of a town nearby. (I was able to get Skyeangel into her 10th
                level within 2 days inside of Misty Thicket)</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#336699">Update -
    7/25/2001</font> </b> - I have gotten many requests from other players on how
    to get their new Wood-Elf Rangers to Misty Thicket. Its a long and Dangerous
    run, so I created a page explaining how to do it. Please click <b class="menuHeader"><a href="http://www.angelflame.com/ranger/misty.html">HERE</a></b>
    for the detailed information...</font></p>
                <p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" color="#336699" size="2">Level
                10 - 13</font> </b></p>
                <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2">After reaching level 10,
                and getting her new spells at level 9, Rainangel hopped the Boat
                toward Freeport. It was her first (as well as my own first) experience
                on the Boat that was full of promise. Rain stayed in East
                Commonlands for the next 3 levels. As a Treehugger, Bears and
                wolves would not attack me on site, and they actually seemed to
                like my presence in their woods. I leveled quite quickly here,
                and always found Vendors more then willing to buy. Stay clear of
                any Griffins that tend to roam the area, and if you get into
                trouble, there is usually quite a few guards that wonder the
                area. Be sure to use your new spells, including Snare. Snare is
                a spell you will use for the rest of your Ranger's life, and if
                I had to choose only one spell out of all the spells we get in
                our early life, I would give them all up to keep Snare.</font></p>
                <p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" color="#336699" size="2">Level
                13 - 17</font> </b></p>
                <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2">After reaching the 13th
                Season of Rain's life, I then headed West into Kizdean Gix's
                Realm of West Commonlands. My favorite scout area in these lands
                was the large hill directly behind the Toll Both. Thanks to a
                real life friend of mine, in game name of Nuriel (Dark Elf
                Shadow Knight) I obtained my first magic weapon in the form of a
                Combine Long Sword. Willow Wisps here I come!! Attack and kill
                anything that Con's blue to you. Be careful when attacking any
                Bears, as they do come to each others aid and more then one at a
                time can be a bit to much to handle. Good place to Med up and
                sit and recover after a fight, is at the Toll Both. There are
                two guards here that will keep you safe from <i>most</i>
                anything that would wonder your way. As you sit at the Toll
                Both, take a look to your left a bit, behind the tree and you
                will see Kizdean Gix. A very nasty Dark Elf Shadow Night that
                will attack you in a heartbeat. He has killed Rain at least 10
                times in her early life. He also has a friend by the name of
                Dragoon Zytl that is a bit tougher then he is. if you see either
                of these two near you or on tracking, stay clear! If you do get
                attacked by one, Run to the East Commonlands zone as fast as you
                can! Every time I was attacked by Gix, He killed me. But with
                Dragoon, I was able to out run him 3 times and get away. Again,
                stay clear of any Griffins and Hill Giants that tend to roam
                this area. At level 15, you find you Ranger has 8 new spells
                available to her... Its worth the trip back to your home town to
                acquire the spells.</font></p>

                <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2">After I made it to the
                17th level of Rainangel's life - I headed to Oasis of Mar. Lots
                of great things here to kill and gain experience! Caimans, Crocodiles,
                Deep Water Caimans and Crocodiles galore!! Attack any that are
                blue to you, and be on the look out for Lockjaw, as he is a tuff
                (and large) named Crocodile that will (unlike his weaker kin)
                attack you on site. I stayed near the waters edge the entire
                time I stayed in this zone. You think Hill Giants were bad
                enough in the Commonlands? In the Oasis, you now have Sand
                Giants, Specters and other nasty high level mobs. The experience
                here is great, and the dangers much greater. If you find your
                self in trouble here, there are no Guards, all you can do is run
                towards a zone line for safety.</font></p>

                <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This was the time I
                started to group, but mostly I grouped with my RL Boyfriend,
                Xthisu (Iksar Necromancer) and Friend, Nuriel (Dark Elf Shadow
                Knight). We headed to The Overthere in Kunark. I know allot of
                people at this time head to Lake of Ill Oman, but The Overthere
                was sooooo much less crowded and the experience was quite awesome!
                At these levels, you will want to stay near the water, and you
                can get bound on the other side of &quot;The Wall&quot;. (Just
                swim around to the other side, and stay AWAY from the dock. you
                are KOS there. We killed Kunark Rhino's, Succulents, Saber Tooth
                Tigers &amp; Tigresses, and of course Sarnaks!! The loot here was
                great, and there is an Iksar Vendor at the Mud Puddle that will
                buy your findings. Stay clear of the Sarnak Fort, as there are
                quite a few Tombstone Reds inside it. I kept Rain here for 5
                levels. Once she reached 25 - It was Revenge/Pay Back time for
                her.</font><p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Remember how I
                told you how Kizdean Gix had killed Rain at least 10 times? Well
                it was pay back time for Gix! Gix was going down no matter what!
                Nuriel wouldn't have anything to do with it (he is after all, a
                Dark Elf) and went to Lake of Ill Omen while I got my revenge
                with the help of Xthisu. It didn't take long at all, and Gix
                con'd blue to me at 25. He did Harm Touch/Life Tap me for 192
                points of damage, but with Xthisu there with his nasty DoTs and
                DD attack, Gix was a rather easy kill. Needless to say, we
                killed him I think 5 times that day&nbsp;&nbsp; :)&nbsp;&nbsp;

                bit of convincing from Nuriel, Xthisu and Rain headed over to
                Lake of Ill Omen... I took the shuttles from Butcher Block to
                the big boat that would take me to Firiona Vie. (Xthisu had to
                take the other route as Iksars are unwelcome in Firiona Vie) It
                was a long ride but I did finally make it there. I got a bind in
                front of the bank, Camo'ed myself and was on my way to LOIO. You
                have to run through some nasty spiders, so your best bet is to
                Camo yourself and run run run following the stream to the zone
                line. Once we met up in LOIO, we headed to the Wind Mill. Here
                we camped a hill just away from the Wind Mill. We killed
                anything that coned blue to us, Goblins, Iksars, Sarnaks and
                more Saber Tooth Kitties. We also camped the back entrance to
                the Goblin cave that connect to Warsliks Woods for 2 - 3 levels.
                Again the loot is good, but its a long run (and dangerous one at
                that) to Firiona Vie.</font><p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We
                also visited South Karana during these levels, at the Aviak
                Village. The Loot was great here as well, plus at this level I
                now had my Harmony Spell which made pulling single Aviak Advocates
                extremely easy. Great Experience here!! Worth a visit!</font><p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" color="#336699" size="2">Level

                decided to try out the now infamous Giants in Frontier
                Mountains at this time. I had just hit my first of many
                &quot;Hell Levels&quot; and Xthisu was 29. We again met up with
                Nuriel and off we went. It is in this zone that I first met
                Reztips Theta of Lords of War. We grouped and camped a hill in
                front of the Giant Fortress. The action was great, the Experience
                was awesome and pretty good loot as well. (They drop Forest
                Loops, Weighted Axes, Leg Choppers, among others) After one good
                night of grouping, I was asked to join Lords of War, and I
                accepted. I managed to make it out of Hell Level in FM. I never
                did get lucky enough to win a roll on a Forest Loop, but I had a
                great time! At level 30, Rangers finally get that long awaited
                spell, Spirit of the Wolf! from this point on, you will never be
                slow again!</font><p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" color="#336699" size="2">Level

                levels 31 - 34, I soloed again, in LOIO. Right behind the zone
                line to Frontier Mountains is a great place to both group and
                solo. Sarnaks, Goblin Warlords, Charbone &amp; Warbone Skelies,
                Iksar Pariahs and not to mention the Kitties were great experience
                soloing. I loved this area, as it was never real crowded here,
                there was a zone line in case of trouble, and the loot was
                really nice as well. This area took Rain all the way up to level
                34 easily. I also made my first life costing mistake in this
                area. I was fighting a Goblin Warlord and all was going as
                planned when another goblin Warlord joined the fight. I knew I couldn't
                take them both as I had 1 yellow bub of health left, so I
                targeted myself, casted a few heals on myself and started
                heading for the zone line. On the way there, I thought I could
                slow the second Goblin down by Snaring him (as he was hitting me
                really hard in the back and threatening to kill me before I
                reached the zone line and I had all ready snared the first one)
                so what did I do? I started casting Snare... As I casted it, I
                noticed I didn't have the Goblin targeted, I had myself
                targeted! Let me tell you how slow you move when you have less
                the a yellow bub of health and have been Snared!! Needless to
                say, I died and lost over a yellow bub of experience! *sigh*

                the chance to get a Forest Loop while getting good exp? I still
                never did get one. This time though, we did not group with
                others. We were taking them down easily with my Snare and his
                Fear. I made it to my next hell Level of 35 here.</font><p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" color="#336699" size="2">Level

                hearing about the new Scars of Velious, It was time for Xthisu
                and I to go check it out (we were over 30 after all). We took
                the Pirate's Skiff from North Ro and crossed the little Isle to
                catch the Ice Breaker Boat to Velious. It wasn't to long of a
                ride, and we found ourselves on a dock of a large island of Ice
                and Snow. Here we hunted Snow Cougars and rested at the
                &quot;Igloo's&quot; for the next 2 levels. Rangers can Solo here
                to a point, Rangers at level 22 get a new spell of Panic Animal
                that acts the same as &quot;Fear&quot; on animals only. I tried this tactic on
                the Snow Cougars with some success. The only times I had
                problems is when the Cougar would agro other Cougars onto me.
                There is no where to &quot;Zone&quot; and escape here and its a
                long run to the &quot;Ice Bridge&quot;. I died 2 times attempting
                this tactic. I will say before I died the first time, I was
                gaining half a blue bub EXP per Cougar Kill. If you can locate
                an area to snare/fear Cougars without Aggroing others, Id say go
                for it! The Cougars also drop the Famous Cougar Claw Earrings
                (Great item for a Ranger). This is a nice place to group, the
                loot is just about nil, but great EXP.</font><p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" color="#336699" size="2">Level

                were still giving good EXP, but we had become bored with no loot
                and the same thing every time. So Xthisu and I headed out to the
                Great Divide. (We needed a bank run anyway). I SoWed and camo'ed
                us and we were off. Its a very long run. Once we got there we
                headed to the bank and restocked on Food and Water as well as
                Arrows for myself (Bind!!). We then headed to the Tizmaks in Great Divide.
                These are great EXP, for a group and quite easy kills. They
                carry no money, but do drop Velium Weapons, as well as Tizmak
                Armor and Rare drops of Cured Tizmak Tunics and even more Rare
                is Cured Tizmak Gloves. The weapons sell for about 4 PP each in
                Thurgadin and the regular armor for about 2 PP each. The Cured
                Armor Id hold onto and sell to Players in East Commonlands. I
                sold a pair of the Cured Tizmak Gloves for 500 PP&nbsp;&nbsp; :)</font><p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You
                also have a chance to kill Yakka Razerhoof here (A really large
