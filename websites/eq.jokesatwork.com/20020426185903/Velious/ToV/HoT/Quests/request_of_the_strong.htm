    Lendiniara the Keeper says 'Greetings Ayama . I am the keeper of relics. If 
    you are brave I have tasks to test your might and perhaps rewards. <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'what rewards' <br>
    <br>
    Lendiniara the Keeper says 'One should ask of the tasks before worrying 
    about rewards Dark Elf. <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'what tasks' <br>
    <br>
    Lendiniara the Keeper says 'Enter into the halls of testing to complete 
    these tasks. Seek out the ancient ones inside and see if your might is as 
    great as theirs and fear not, those who you slay will be returned to the 
    temple by the gift of Veeshan's great power. I have three tasks, which any 
    may complete, as well as a request of both the arcane and the strong. <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'what request of the strong' <br>
    <br>
    Lendiniara the Keeper says 'Those who believe they are strong may be 
    surprised after such a task. Seek out the cursed one and slay him, return to 
    me when you have gathered a silver tear, a poison tear a flame kissed tear 
    and an emerald tear. End the cursed ones torment for a short time, before 
    the high priest raises him to continue his suffering for eternity. </td>
