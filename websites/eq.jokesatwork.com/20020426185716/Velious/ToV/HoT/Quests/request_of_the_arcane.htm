    Lendiniara the Keeper says 'Greetings Ayama. I am the keeper of relics. If 
    you are brave I have tasks to test your might and perhaps rewards. <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'what rewards' <br>
    <br>
    Lendiniara the Keeper says 'One should ask of the tasks before worrying 
    about rewards Dark Elf. <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'what tasks' <br>
    <br>
    Lendiniara the Keeper says 'Enter into the halls of testing to complete 
    these tasks. Seek out the ancient ones inside and see if your might is as 
    great as theirs and fear <br>
    not, those who you slay will be returned to the temple by the gift of 
    Veeshan's great power. I have three tasks, which any may complete, as well 
    as a request of both the <br>
    arcane and the strong. <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'what request of the arcane' <br>
    <br>
    Lendiniara the Keeper says 'Those who seek knowledge, will seek this task 
    out for its reward is great. Three tears and a glowing orb will garner one 
    an ancient mask. The White tear and the black tear for balance the runed 
    tear to hold the balance and a glowing orb to return raw energy to the 
    ancient mask. <br>
