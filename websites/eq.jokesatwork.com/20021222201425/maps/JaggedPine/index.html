<p><br>
I zoned into Jaggedpine and know this druid is home.
<a href="http://www.glorysite.com/eq/sh2" style="text-decoration: none">Read 
about the event opening this new zone</a> on my ''News/Events'' page. It is the 
same way I feel in Surefall Glades. This is ranger and druid heaven. You get to 
the zone by the bear caves in Surefall Glades or Blackburrow. I went through 
Surefall. You go through the false cave wall entrance behind the druid guild, up 
to the right, keep taking rights. You will see a globe there, you just click on 
it, good idea to camo or invis first in case the gnolls have taken over the 
fort. You will land right in the Fort. </p>
<p>I played this zone first on Test server with my 55 druid, then Legends with 
my 60 druid. Jaggedpine is a pretty zone much like Surefall Glades. I was able 
to check my tracking on my 55 druid and most everything was light blue and blue 
and tons of greens near the Fort, while my 60 druid had tons of greens till she 
got much further out. Then my 60 druid saw light blue gnolls, blue potamiads and 
snakes. Lots of gnolls. This is a regular, if not small, town. There is a 
banker, merchants and even merchants for tradeskills, just not a lot of them. 
There seems to be a bunch of quests, still figuring those out. Egress (succor 
etc.) takes you to n660 p2000. This is near the BB tunnel and if you go north 
you run into the Fort not far. Most of the bad stuff is considered animals and 
love druids and ranger. However, at this point, do not wear wolf form or the 
treants attack you. Hopefully they will see the error of this and change it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font colo="gold">Brell Tunnel</font></i></p>
</center>
<p><br>
In the Brell tunnel is the portal to BB, Brell Gnolls which include a banker 
gnoll, n1117, p3475, which a the tunnel to the left of the main Brell area where 
the Oracle is and the large pool. There is also the Chef Brargus who sells fool 
and drink, Dunarl gnoll who sell blacksmithing supplies, Snarla the Fang quest 
gnoll, Quartarmaster Grarucks sells instruments and lanterns, Karka gnoll sells 
ceramic sketches. </p>

<i><font color="gold">poachers, dryads</font></i><br>
I found a rather large poacher camp at n700 n1600 very near the river and the 
nasty mobs, potamids, fill the river, these are dark blue to 55 druid and more 
greens, with light blue gnolls, potamids and snakes to my 60 druid. I would say 
this zone is for levels 35 to 60 with the bad stuff further out. There are 
dryads that are friendly to me and even evil races, and so very interesting. 
They start as a poofy flame then turn into a scantily clad female that poofs 
from place to place as a flame turned female. </p>
<p><i><font color="gold">wisps, black panthers, bears, wolves, griffawns, 
griffons</font></i><br>
There are wisps that are light blue to level 60, black panters, wolves and 
bears. I was a tad leary about killing bears and would not kill a bear near the 
Fort. You get a faction hit agains the Jaggedpine folks if you kill the black 
panthers, wolves and bears. They have the same attitude about this as Surefall 
Glades does. Druids and rangers can kite in relative safety since the other 
animals do not attack, unless in wolf form, then treants do. However, remember 
this is all subject to change, and I complained about treants attacking us in 
wolf form geesh. Only thing you have to watch for is the griffawns, griffons and 
wandering poachers. The griffons are light blue to 60 and rarely drop a nice 
item. Griffawns are green to 55 and near the fort. I believe these are perfect 
for the mid levels.</p>
<p><i><font color="gold">treants, anacondas, basilisks, Darkpaw gnolls</font></i><br>
Found a wandering treant and now I see four treants on my tracking, not sure why 
they are here, and a rather enormous snake called an anacondra, blue to me. The 
gnolls are called Darkpaws and are mean. However, they seem to start out 
dubuious or apprehensive to some people and there is a banker and merchants in 
their cave system (per some adventurers), suggesting that people can chose their 
faction like the giants and coldains. Their cave is at p2165 p650 and deep 
inside are green basilisks and more of the huge snakes called anacondas. So, as 
far as I can tell, you have to get past the tons of dark blue nasty gnolls to 
get to more of the large snakes and basilisks. </p>

<p>The curate gnoll can drop a &quot;pine shaft pike&quot; which I sold for 30pp to a 
merchant. Stats are 30delay, 12dmg, sec, primary or range slot, ac3 HP25, 
weights 4.5 and war, ranger, pal, shm, shd, rogue and bard can use. </p>

<p><i><font color="gold">potameids</font></i><br>
The Potameids vary greatly by class. The wildings, guardians and protectors are 
melee class and do not see through invis, however, you can not snare, root or 
slow them. All the casters see through invis and resist magic for the most part. 
Near the poachers camp, in the river is an underwater cave loaded with these 
stinkers. No faction hits on these. The queen does summon and is in the cave.
</p>
<p><i><font color="gold">Basilisk</font></i><br>
Between the tunnel to the BB clicker globe and the tunnel to the Brell gnolls is 
a tunnel to Basilisks. These are green to my 55 druid so no idea what level they 
are. They do drop eggs, eye stalks. </p>

<p><br>
I foraged some items, there were no drops called Shadowjade Fern seeds, 
Jaggedpine Needles, Shadowjade Moss, Shadowjade Fern Leaves, Jaggedpine Sap, Dew 
of the Hatchling and common food items, berris, pod of water, rabbit meat, 
veggies. I was told that these were for quests involving baking. I need to get 
my faction up with the locals first so they will talk to me.</p>

<p><br>
I would highly recommend that you invis then zone into Jaggedpine, run up to the 
hill and con the citizens with invis off. You can fix your faction killing 
Darkpaw gnolls and poachers, gnolls are dark blue to me at 55 and lightblue at 
60, and poachers light blue to 55. You can ruin your faction with JP by killing 
panthers, wolves and bears. Dryads have their own faction, everyone starts out 
indifferent. Once you ruin this faction, I have not found a way to fix it. </p>
<p>Evil races can invis and go through Surefall Glades or use the Blackburrow 
globe (just click on it) in the bottom of Blackburrow, you will enter into a 
cavern with no problems, then just make all lefts till you are out in the open. 
You land in the Brell gnoll cavern. </p>
<p>There is a wonderful cave at p235 p2698 that is on Brell faction and me being 
Tunare was apprehensive. There are green gnolls that protect a blue Oracle (to 
level 60). Beautiful area, not sure what this is for. In this same cave to the 
right all the way at p155 p155 is the Blackburrow globe that your click on. In 
Blackburrow, the globe is at p235 p2698 by the water down low at the end of two 
ramps. The two ramps each have a door at the top and come down on either side of 
the globe. Below are listed some quests for fixing faction. You can get to ally 
with the Brell gnolls with about 20 or few more dryad or potameid pates. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<center>
<p><a name="quests" style="text-decoration: none"><b>QUESTS</b></a></p>
</center>
<p><br>
Most of the quests your faction will need to be ally. You get this by killing 
the gnolls and poachers...however, poachers alone is not enough. Some quests can 
be done with amiably faction. The Brell gnolls are on different faction then the 
rest of the zone. Still exploring that faction and there are some nice quests in 
the Brell tunnel. Turn gnoll canines from the Darkpaws into the Sergeant at the 
Fort. </p>
<p>Some of the quests involve foraging, some involve killing the gnolls who 
attack the fort. In order to turn in the no rent items looted off the gnoll who 
attack the Fort, you need to keep the guard alive and when all the other gnolls 
die, a named gnoll will spawn by that guard, someone needs to be there to defend 
the guard and kill the named. Turning in the no rent items result in some nice 
no drop items. Each no rent piece has on it who can use what will result from 
turning it in. The no rent item can be given to the correct class to turn in.
</p>
<p><i><font color="gold">JP Armor Quests:</font></i><br>
You have to be ally to do this. To find out the story of the Potameids and more 
info on the quests that Cheyloh Greenwood has for you, just ask her &quot;who is 
Myraephe the Pure?&quot; and &quot;what ancient suit of leather?&quot;. </p>
<p>Cheyloh Greenwood tells you she will make druid and ranger armor...and I am 
not sure if it is Karana only or Tunare too. You tell her &quot;I wish to acquire&quot;: 
(boots, sleeves, bracer, leggings, circlet). She will tell you to talk to some 
NPCs in Surefall for the rest of the quest armor, however, those NPCs do not 
seem to be around. She will tell you to obtain some items off Potameids in 
Hatchling River too. You need to find Jhaya Wyndrunner, Lerian Wyndrunner, in 
Surefall Glades. </p>
<p>She states that the most powerful piece of armor, the Tunic of the Pines, is 
created by her father Nolan Greenwood. You ask Nolan &quot;what trials?&quot; and he will 
tell you what you need for the tunic. </p>
<p><i><font color="gold">JP weapon quest</font></i><br>
Find Kaithys Galestrider and ask him these questions:<br>
What great knowledge do you hold<br>
What threat<br>
What turmoil<br>
What interest<br>
How aiding a much greater threat<br>
What report<br>
What group<br>
Why is it troubling<br>
What are their philosophies<br>
Why do they have no desire to leave their woods<br>
Tell me what efforts have proven to be in vain<br>
I will return the tome<br>
What key materials<br>
What horrible danger<br>
How were the tides turned<br>
Were you victoriouis<br>
How were they aiding a much greater threat<br>
Why would they have no desire to leave the woods?<br>
What is the name of the blade?<br>
Apparently this results in a weapon quest. However, be sure to ask all the 
questions, he has quite a story to tell with hints on what and where you need to 
find items. </p>
<p><i><font color="gold">Qeynos Badge of Honor quest</font></i><br>
You need to already have the
<a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1288" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">
Qeynos Badge of Honor</a> which you will give to Sergeant Caelin in Jaggedpine 
after you reach ally to him. He will give you Marked Badge of honor &amp; Warning. 
This quest does not end here. Part of it is currently broken but a patch is 
coming soon. Sergeant Caelin also wants Shift Report from Guard Finewine. Guard 
Finewine wants some dryad or potameid pate first before he will part with the 
report (recipe below). Finewine then says he wants panther pate and will give 
you a no drop brandy for the dryad/potameid pate. The brandy is for the recipe 
below.<br>
<i><font color="gold">panther pate</font></i><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>no drop panther liver from JP panthers<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>foraged plant shoots<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>no drop brandy from guard<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>spices<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>combine in an oven or spit<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>combine is currently broke on this<br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><i><font color="gold">Brell gnoll faction</font></i><br>
You can improve your faction with the Oracle and Brell gnolls by making and 
giving Dryad or Potameid pate to the Snarla the Fang.<br>
<i><font color="gold">dryad, potameid pate</font></i><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>First you need Dryad meat (which will lower your faction with Dryads and 
  they are everywhere in this zone) or Potameid meat (trivial 151)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>foraged plant shoots<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>brandy<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>spices<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>combine in an oven or spit which will result in a +4 wisdom banquet meal 
  for the dryad recipe and +4 intelligence banquet meal for the potameid recipe.<br>
  <i><font color="gold">thank you Bogfly for this recipe and info</font></i><br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a necklace quest you can do to improve the Brell faction. When 
you turn the pate in to the Oracle he gives you a bone, you give him the bone 
and get a pouch and the bone back. You combine the pouch 3 black panther fangs 
or 3 wolf fangs or 3 bear fangs with (from Jaggedpine panther which is bad JP 
faction killing them) 1 anaconda skin. Each of these combos make a necklace of 
that type. You turn one of each necklace in to the Oracle, all at one time. In 
return, you will get faction and an item, uncomfirmed, staff.<br>
<font color="gold"><i>what the Oracle says:</i><br>
I like necklaces, I wear necklaces made from every kind of beast. The power of 
the beast is contained within each necklace. The more necklaces I wear, the 
great my power! Bring me a Bear Fang Necklace, a Wolf Fang Necklace, and a 
Panther Fang Necklace. This will show your devotion to the temple. Then Perhaps 
I can do you a (favor).</font> </p>
<p><i><font color="gold">Oracle quest</font></i><br>
Once you have good enough faction with Brell, you can do a quest with the Oracle 
that results in a spear for Necros and Shadowknights only. There are several 
parts to this quest. The Oracle wants a (favor). He wants 1 Griffon Skull, 1 
Griffon Down, 1 Diseased Bear Liver and 1 Treant Finger. The Griffon skull and 
down is are no drop items off the griffons in Jaggedpine. The treant finger is 
no drop off treants, and the liver quest is the &quot;Nash Head Quest&quot;. If you do 
this quest, you will have a huge drop in Jaggedpine faction. </p>
<p><i><font color="gold">Snarla the Fang</font></i><br>
Ask her &quot;How do I respect the Temple&quot; then &quot;what food&quot; and finally &quot;what Dryad 
Pate?&quot;. Here she sends you to Braguss the cook for the recipe. </p>
<p><i><font color="gold">Nash head quest</font></i><br>
Nash is a very MR guard in Qeynos Hills. If you kill him, you will get his head 
which you then turn into Jarkus who then walks over to Randel Stormwind, the man 
with the bear at the Jaggedpine Fort. You wait for the bear to leave that spot 
and follow to another where he is fed a liver by the NPC and turns into a 
&quot;defiled bear&quot;, which you then kill and loot the diseased liver. This is what 
you turn into the Oracle for his quest. See the Oracle quests. </p>
<p><i><font color="gold">pirate head quest</font></i><br>
You can gain faction with Jaggedpine by giving the 4 heads of the named pirates 
to Randel Stormwind, the man with the bear, at the Fort. This is also part of a 
quest. I have not done this quest yet, so not sure what all is involved, but he 
will talk to you at even apprehensive.<br>
