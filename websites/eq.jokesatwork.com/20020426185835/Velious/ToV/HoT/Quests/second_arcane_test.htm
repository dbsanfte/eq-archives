    Gozzrem says 'Greetings Ayama . If you seek wisdom or the arcane I have 
    tasks in the halls of testing you may complete to gain what you seek. <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'I seek the arcane' <br>

    Gozzrem says 'To garner a reward fit for one who walks the arcane path 
    return to me the poison tear and the poison symbol. Along with these return 
    the serrated symbol and the runed symbol. If this task is not hard enough 
    for you, I have a second quest for you. <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'what is the second quest?' <br>
    <br>
    Gozzrem says 'Tears may fall to the ground but not the ones you seek now. 
    The black tear and the ruby tear you must seek. For more power I require the 
    ruby symbol and a white <br>
    symbol to bind the powers together. Upon the return of these four objects 
    you will receive a wondrous reward. </td>
