<p><font size="6">Plane of Growth.</font></p>
<font size="3"><b>
<p>Zone in</b>: The portal is located in the wakening lands. The location is 
Pos1000 Neg500. I suggues getting an invis so you don’t have to deal with the 
creature in the zone while making your way to the PoG zone in. At the location I 
gave you you'll see a lake with a small island. A bridge crosses the water 
leading into a tower on the island. Fauns guard the tower. If you're not an evil 
race/Class you should not be KOS unless you have hunted them. Check your faction 
before strolling past them. If they &quot;Scowl, Ready to attack&quot; or if they are 
&quot;Threateningly&quot; you'll need someone to invis you. If your smart you'll already 
be invis'd from the run to the tower. Run into the tower and on your right there 
is a ramp. Runing up the ramp to the top you'll see the tower has a few levels 
but is primarily vacant. Once at the top of the tower, you'll see a big orb 
looking thing. You click on it to zone into PoG (But don't go in until your raid 
leader tells you to zone in). At the very top, the groups should buff up and get 
invis, and all zone in at once. </p>
</font>
<p><font size="3"><b>Break in:</b> When you zone in you'll find yourself 
standing on a white pad. This looks a lot like a druid port circle but is white 
mable. There is a creature called a &quot;<a href="Beasts/wholrofnaturalenergy.jpg">Whorl 
of natural energy</a>&quot;&nbsp; Once you appear youll be facing south. So turn right and 
head to the zone wall (west). The zone wall is not very far from the zone in 
spot. By the time everyone has made it to the west wall. Recently the Whorl has 
been given the ability to see invis. He will most likely agro on someone. Pull 
him to the zone wall to kill him. Everyone else should stay invis until they get 
to the wall so they dont agro other creatures on the way.You'll need to kill it 
quickly. The &quot;<a href="Beasts/protectorofgrowth.jpg">Protectors of Growth</a>&quot; 
will be on thier way immediately. The &quot;Protector of Growth&quot; usually spawns in 
pairs and they see across the entire zone.&nbsp; Ocasionally only one will be up when 
you zone in. They will head towards your raid as soon as someone who is KOS is 
visible. At this point drop invis (if you didnt have to kill the whorls) and get 
ready for the protectors of growth (pets go up, etc). They can't be mezzed. The 
most common practice is to have everyoen get on one Protector and have one or 
two Melee types (High Level) tank the other one. Kill one then move to the next. 
Appoint somone to keep track of the timing on the Protectors. Their spawn time 
is 28 Minutes. You will have to kill them several times and they drop nothing.
</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><strong>Scouting</strong>: You can have 
druids/rangers/paladins scout the place. DO NOT have druids/rangers/paladins 
fight in PoG. If they do they won't be able to do their epic and life will be 
miserable for them. If they accidently take a faction hit, they need to leave 
immediately. 2 kills will make you kos. If you do happen to take a faction hit, 
go to west freeport and give that guy in the inn tons and tons of muffins. This 
will repair most of the faction lost there. There are 4 factions you take. 
Faydark Champions, and 3 tunare related factions. I honestly have found little 
use for scouts. The puller will generally have a good idea on whats out there 
and how to pull it.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><strong>Pulls in PoG</strong>: After pogs die, you can pull 
mobs from the zone. The best class to have pull in PoG is a bard. Alot of the 
creatures run faster than sow and some even summon. Bards can handle both of 
these issues. The creatures that run faster than sow will still be slower than a 
bard so pulling them back to the groups wont be a problem. The creatures that 
summon will do so if they take any dmg. Bards avoid this by using thier songs to 
taunt the creature and pull it back to the groups. A monk is the second choice 
puller and will help is some of the pulls anyway. The only downside to having a 
monk (or any melee) pull is that the creatures faster than sow will beat on them 
the entire time they pull to the groups and sometimes they wont even make it 
back. The creatures that summon are not as much of an issue but without a NON 
Damage Ranges attack (like a bard song) the melee type pullers will have to get 
close enough to the creatures to agro them. This will put the puller in danger 
simply because of the DMG output these creatures have. On the west side of the 
river the creatures are not as tough, but there are lost of them. Another 
advantage a bard has is that he has track. A bard can pinpoint the locations of 
each creature and pick the best pulls. Once you move East of the river the 
creatures get tougher and harder to pull.&nbsp; There isn't as much field of view for 
the puller as this area is heavily wooded and hilly. </font></p>
<p><font size="3"><strong>Pull Locations: </strong>Here is a
<a href="../../maps/Zone_Files/pog1.jpg">map of the zone</a>.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The following is a list of the usual spot to pull from and the 
creatures you can expect to see in those locations. At any of these location you 
may see creatures that spawn zonewide. There are almost no static spawns in PoG. 
So many of the creatures will roam in and out of the area while pulling. At just 
about any of the pull locations you my or may not see named creatures such as

<p><font size="3"><strong>Precautions</strong>: At all of the pull locations you 
will face creatures that can gate or wipe out the raid(when you pull too many). 
If the creature gate it will usually heal itself and start summoning people. if 
this happens you will want to camp out immediately wait a minutes or two then 
come right back. DO NOT /q or /exit. Sit camp, and wait the 30 seconds. If you 
/q or /exit the game will treat you as ingame and you could cause problems with 
agro. If you get summoned just get your location and die. The raid will get your 
corpse after everyone camps out and comes back. The best way to prevent 
creatures from gating is to have the nukers wait until the creature is about 40% 
life. Then CHAIN NUKE and STUN. The Tranquil Treants are the gaters you'll deal 
with ealry in the raid. When you start killing the Thiflings you'll deal with 
the other issue. These creatures will wipe out a raid if you get too many. Some 
raids I have been on got wiped out when we got just 3 of these. The trick is in 
the pulling. If you ever see a puller come back with more than 3 of these, don't 
even wait. sit and start camping. Unless your raid consists of many 55+ players 
you will not be able to handle that many of these. The Thiflings are not too bad 
when you get one or even two at a time.&nbsp; you just have to be carefull. you will 
have to gauge the skill of the players in the raid. some raids will be able to 
handle many of them and some will recover corpse after pulling just 2.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<strong>Corpse Recovery</strong>: This is prolly the most unpleasant parts of a 
raid. If you have a well organized raid and several high level players, you 
might not ever have to do a CR. Sometimes even good raids get wiped out though. 
Here are a few tips for the CR. There WIL be PoGs to deal with durring the 
proccess. What youll have to do is have the bard kite them while the rest of the 
raid does CR. Hopefully you were able to have a cleric camp out before the 
wipeout. If so then he can log in and res the clerics. Then rez the manna 
batteries. <br>
<br>
<strong>Raid Finally</strong>: Gate/Translocate/Port. Nuff said. This is the 
only way out so make sure you have wizards and druids on the raid or your tanks 
will be stranded.</font></p>
