<h3><FONT face=Arial>Introduction</FONT></h3>

<p><FONT face=Arial>I have only one point to make here, and will be brief to stress it: learn the rules of 
Fearplane. If you break a rule, YOU will cause the death of the entire party. YOU can potentially turn a successful 
raid into a ten hour corpse retrieval. YOU are not an asset, but a liability to the entire raid if you go into Fear 
without learning the rules.  Education can make you useful. Please take the time to learn some key points in this 
guide. Not only will they save your life, but they will drastically increase the chances at having a successful 
raid. Having said that, we can proceed to the Plane and how to get in successfully.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>To begin, you must be level 46 or higher to enter this zone, but you should probably be a 
couple of bubbles into 46 before you come because you're going to lose a lot of that XP, just accept that now. All 
of the MOBs in Fear can hit in the 130+ range and range from levels in the high 40s to low 50s. They have an 
abnormally high aggro radius and sometimes aggro from out of sight. For the most part they drop class specific no 
drop armor, all of it no drop.</FONT>

<A NAME="02">

<h3><FONT face=Arial>The MOBs</FONT></h3>

<p><FONT face=Arial>First, let's look at the MOBs that drop your armor.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Amygdalan Knights</b> - The Amygdalan Knight is a Shadowknight as the name implies. They 
come complete with useless (although annoying) pets. They drop Umbral Platemail armor (Shadowknight only). Their 
special skills are Harm Touch and Mana Drain. These can usually be seen guarding the temples of Fright, Dread, 
and Terror.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Fetid Fiends (Male)</b> - Resembles a huge zombie. They drop Valorium armor (Paladin only). 
Their special skill is Disease.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Gorgons</b> - Gorgons resemble Harpies from Steamfont Mountains but with snakes coming out 
of their heads. Gorgons drop Vermiculated armor (Druid only). Their special skill is a 15 second stun which can get 
pretty nasty if there's a couple of them on you so having a high magic resistance for these things is pretty 
essential.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Tentacle Tormentors</b> - Tormentors resemble their weaker cousins from Unrest and Najena. 
Chain stunning these guys is a good idea - it keeps them from using their special skills. They drop Thorny Vine 
armor (Ranger only) as well as a druid based belt. Their special skills are Lifetap, Throwback, and an area affect 
debuf. Like the Glare Lords (see below), they're going to wipe out a lot of your buffs which kind of sucks. Their 
knockback is quite nasty as well. If you're fighting them with a camp against a zone wall, fight them with your 
backs to the zone wall so that if you get knocked back, you don't go far and can return to the fight quickly.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Shiverbacks</b> - Looks like a big ape from Cazic Thule but hits hard and fast. They drop 
Shiverback armor (Monk only). They have no special skills.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Frightfingers</b> - Resembles a very small Reanimated Hand from Lower Guk or Unrest. They 
drop Carmine armor (Wizard only). Their special skill is wizard spells, which they cast a lot of.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Boogeymen</b> - Resembles a huge Ghoul. They drop Blighted armor (Necromancer only). Their 
special skill is Ghoulroot.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Spinechiller Spiders</b> - Spiders are always fun. They drop Cryosilk armor (caster based so 
it can be worn by wizards, enchanters, necromancers, and magicians). Their special skill is a relatively tame cold 
based DoT spell that hits for 300 in 30 ticks.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Phoboplasms</b> - Often called "jello", these resemble gelatinous cubes from Splitpaw of old, 
Runnyeye, or the Qeynos Aqueducts. They are located in the temple of Cazic Thule. Jello are loved by all because 
they can randomly drop any piece of planar armor in the game, including armor for classes such as rogues, bards, 
clerics, and warriors which is normally found in the Plane of Hate. There are conflicting reports as to whether 
jello can truly drop ANY piece or just 1 piece from each class (i.e. Cleric Boots, Bard Bracer, Paladin Bracer, 
Warrior Gauntlets, etc.). Their special skill is an area effect debuff, but whereas the Glare Lords and Tentacle 
Tormentors debuff four buffs at a time, these only debuff 1 buff at a time.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>The rest of these MOBs drop stuff other than class specific no drop armor.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Amygdalan Warriors</b> - The Amygdalan Warrior is just a Knight without the ability to 
harm touch or make a pet. This means they still mana sink and because they're warriors, they have a much higher 
magic resistance than most things in the zone. They are extremely common in the zone and you'll be fighting an 
awful lot of these. They drop a warrior only shield and whip. A lot of these are either found wandering the zone or 
protecting the main temple of Cazic Thule.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Fetid Fiends (Female)</b> - Resembles a huge Tormented Dead (those female zombies from 
Unrest). They drop a girdle that's quite good for Clerics. They have no special skills.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Turmoil Toads</b> - Resemble small Froglock ghouls that can be found in Najena or Lower 
Guk. Toads drop Turmoil Warts and a belt for Shamans. Their special skill used to be Ghoulroot, but recently this 
has changed to Fear. This is why you want to have SoW and Run OFF when attacking these guys. If they fear you and 
you start to run away from them quickly, you could run far enough to start aggroing other stuff.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Glare Lords</b> - Resembles a small version of an evil eye. Glare Lords are enchanters, 
although I have never seen one charm anyone. They come with Enchanter pets and drop wands for Mages and Enchanters. 
Their special skill is an area effect debuff which is quite nasty. You could fight just one of these things and 
find ten buffs are gone by the end of the fight.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Scarelings</b> - These little critters look like little imps from Solsek B Efreeti area or 
Kindle in Solsek A. They are rogues and backstab for 400+. These are VERY deadly and always the first target when 
one is in the camp. Another deadly tactic of the Scareling is to teleport anyone to a random location (not too far 
away) potentially starting a massive train leading to a total wipe out of the raiding party. This is pretty much 
why they're given the highest priority. They're also very hard to target and see because of their size. They also 
run faster than SoW so kiting them is pretty hard. Repeat, Scarelings must die, and die fast. Scarelings drop a 
rogue-only rapier. Their special skill is Backstab and Teleport.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Phantasms</b> - Phantasms resemble spectres. The drop nothing of note and have no special 
skills.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Worry Wraiths</b> - Looks like a giant will-o-wisp with a pet. If these are not dispelled, 
they have a damage shield that can cause many people to go linkdead from the amount of "Billy was burned" messaages. 
They drop nothing of note and have no special skills.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Samhains</b> - Resembles a jack-o-lantern from the yard of Unrest or a scarecrow from the 
farms in West Karana. These drop a ranger only axe. They have no special skills.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Nightmares</b> - Looks like a big black horse but squeaks like a rusty swingset. They drop a 
cloak which is pretty much crap on a stick. Their special skill is Blind and have been known to Fear as well.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Dracoliche</b> - This looks like a huge Ashenbone Drake from Plane of Hate. If you have 
never seen one of those, you have never seen anything that looks like a Dracoliche. All I can say is that it looks 
like Vox or Nagafen died, decomposed, then returned to life with just its bones. This is Cazic Thule’s number one 
guardian. This bone dragon is a shadowknight with a pet. Attacking the Dracoliche always aggros Cazic himself, and 
throughout the battle with Draco, Cazic will be death-touching constantly, as well as sending in reinforcements. He 
has a mean disease based DOT and dragon roar (area effect Fear). Leave it to Verant to make a bone dragon, call it 
a liche, and NOT make it undead. That's right, absolutely no undead attack spells work on Draco. After the Draco 
fight, everyone will have to log out, wait 3 minutes and log back in unless other specified by the raid leader. 
Draco spawns once a week (real time). It's special skills are a DoT and dragon roar.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Fright, Dread, and Terror</b> - These are Cazic Thule’s little buddies that have temples 
located around the zone. They are large versions of the three golems from Cazic Thule. Fighting any one of these 
will also aggro Cazic. They drop nothing but some spare change. Their special skill is usually Blind.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Cazic Thule</b> - Cazic is a God. Cazic is a vengeful God. Cazic does not like people. Cazic 
does not like you. In general, he is a level 55 MOB that has several irritating quirks. First, he hits for 400 and 
double attacks. Second, he uses gravity flux like it is going out of style. Every time you are fluxed, it removes 
one buff (put JBoots in top buff slot and reactivate after every flux). Third, Cazic has pets. Not a typo, plural 
pets, and they are fairly irritating, although nothing to lose sleep over. His special skills are Gravity Flux, 
phat melee skillz, and debuffing mojo.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Last, but not lEast, the most fearsome of all of the enemies in Fearplane...</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Someone who does not follow the Fearplane rules</b> - This enemy is in your ranks. He could 
even be grouped with you. This enemy is fearsome because of its ability to kill 50+ people within 3 minutes. Their 
special skills are Train Making.</FONT>

<A NAME="03">

<h3><FONT face=Arial>Raid Requirements</FONT></h3>

<p><FONT face=Arial>First off, the raid should never exceed 7 full groups. The lag in a fully populated fearplane 
is incredible, and increases exponentially with over 42 people. If there are more people that want to go, there is 
ample opportunity for them to support the troops outside the portal.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Tanks (and a lot of them)</b> - Tanks in the raid need to get out their old armor class gear 
and dust it off. On the initial attempt, armor class is key. MOBs in there hit for 130+, as stated previously, and 
the more hits you can take, the longer you can stay alive to support the casters.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Monks (at lEast two)</b> - You need to have monks in at the zone in point or you're never going 
to break this place. Two monks feigned on either side of the zone in portal will be able to relay information back 
to the raid on when the safest time is to zone in. If you can't get monks to do it, the onus will fall on necros to 
do the job.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Clerics</b> - Each group going in really needs to have at lEast one cleric. Druids and 
Shamans do not substitute in this instance. They will be very occupied in other capacities inside such as charming 
and blasting. You need a devoted healer that has only one objective: Keep everyone alive as long as possible. 
Finding clerics for fear raids is rough, but you really have to make it a major priority. Raids have survived with <br>
one cleric, but not for long.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Druids and Shamans</b> - Druids are essential for the raiding party. They can charm animal 
MOBs that enter the camp without invitation, turning a foe into a nice level 50 pet. Shamans can Togor MOBs and 
drastically reduce the amount of damage dealt by them, as well as Malosi them to allow the casters to work more 
effectively.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Necromancers</b> - Necros perform a dual role in a break. First of all, the break involves 
having some key positions occupied by characters that are feigned; Second, necros can charm the undead MOBs that 
enter the camp without warning, again turning a foe into a very nice pet.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Enchanters</b> - Enchaters are the king of the debuffs, and this just may tip the scales in 
your favor, allowing you to eliminate a few MOBs. They can also mezmerize MOBs that enter the camp that cannot be 
charmed by either necros or druids (ie. Scarelings and Amys). Clarity may also make the difference by allowing that 
one extra blast, or that one extra heal. Some battles last upwards of 10 minutes, and clarity is very effective in 
these circumstances.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial><b>Magicians</b> - Every raid needs a magician. After the initial rush, the melee types won't 
have gear any more. They will need many things summoned including food, water and weapons. The mage is a key 
component of the raid.</FONT>

<A NAME="04">

<h3><FONT face=Arial>Preparation</FONT></h3>

<p><FONT face=Arial>1. All tanks need to be bound in Ogguk at the entrance. If the raid has rangers, the rangers 
can spirit of wolf the people that arrive in Ogguk after they are killed inside. If there are no rangers on the 
raid (although highly unlikely), at lEast one druid or shaman needs to bind in Ogguk also to SoW the newly dead 
troops to get past the bouncers outside. Also, someone that can cast ultravision or infravision is needed, as 
Feerott is a dark place already, and the humans and erudites that need to get back to the portal cant see anything 
at all.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>2. All casters that can bind, do so by the rock right outside of the portal. That area is void 
of wandering skeletons that always seem to show up right when you respawn back outside.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>3. Cyndereela: She is the necro that guards the portal into Fear. Ideally, a group of people 
may be camping her for experience. If not, designate a few people to kill her when she spawns. She is dangerous 
only because she can see invisible, and will attack people zoning in, thereby rendering them visible. Being 
visible when entering the Plane of Fear = BAD.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>4. Buffs: Every party must be composed of tanks and at lEast one cleric, and ideally, one 
druid. On the initial rush, the buffs are as follows:</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial></FONT></p><li><FONT face=Arial><b>Tanks</b>: Clerical Reso/Shield/Symbol, Shamanic Talismans, 
Stamina, Levitate (or Dead Man Floating), See Invis, and finally Invis. Some people will tell you Superior Camo 
is just as effective as Invis but many people just don't believe it. Strength and Agility are also nice, as is 
Dexterity for tanks with weapons that proc.</FONT>

<li><FONT face=Arial><b>Priests/Casters</b>: All of the above buffs except strength and dexterity. They can get 
clarity instead.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>This is where some of the extra people can come in to the picture. If there are more than 42 
people, the extra people can stand outside the portal and hold gems for symbols and shield skin, food and water, 
etc. for the troops that will be back shortly naked. Extra people can also be buffers. All of the buffs take time 
and mana away from the people going inside. Extra people outside to aid in the buffing can be very helpful.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>5. Feign Death: At lEast 2 people are going to need to get inside and feign death in 2 key 
locations. The first person will go inside and feign death right at the portal. This person is responsible for 
letting the people on the outside know when the portal area is clear of wandering MOBs. When the portal area is 
clear, and there is a safe route to the West camp, the second person will enter and proceed to the West camp and 
feign there. This person serves a dual purpose. First, they notify the raiders when the camp is clear. Second, 
they serve as a beacon to let the raiders know where to go upon entering the Plane. Therefore the second person 
who feigns must know exactly where the camp needs to be established.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>6. The Gathering: When everyone is buffed and the two inside are in place safely, everyone must 
gather in front of the portal and await the charge command. The raid leader must designate the order of the groups 
to enter, and groups will enter 10 seconds apart. At this point, it is very important to be camouflaged at all 
times as the charge command can come at any time.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>7. The assist hotkey: The raid leader will announce who the main and secondary tanks are. You 
may have been in situations before when you said to yourself "I don’t need to make an assist key, I can see what 
they are attacking and hit it." This is not one of those times. You MUST make your assist hotkey for the tanks. If 
you don’t know how to make a hotkey, for the love of Mithanial Marr, ask someone.</FONT>

<A NAME="05">

<h3><FONT face=Arial>The First Rush</FONT></h3>

<p><FONT face=Arial>1. YOU WILL DIE!! This point cannot be stressed enough. Do not think that by using some sneaky 
tactic or superior knowledge you can survive. This mentality only hurts the group and causes the raid to fail. Go 
in there KNOWING that you are about to emerge naked at your bind point. That being said, go in there DETERMINED to 
live as long as possible and kill as much as you can.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>2. When the people inside give the go-ahead, you must act fast. Group 1 (ideally the strongest 
group) zones into fear, takes a 90 degree turn left, runs down the hill to the wall where the person is feigned. 
After group 1, group 2 goes in 10 seconds later and heads to the camp, repeat the process with all groups. This is 
where the raid can succeed or fail. The first minute can determine the success of the raid, as the two most important 
rules apply here. They are:</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>A. If you are attacked outside of camp, STAND AND DIE!!! In case someone missed that, let me 
rephrase it. STOP MOVING, DO NOT RUN TO CAMP, DO NOT RUN AWAY FROM CAMP, DO NOT RUN ANYWHERE!!! If ONE single 
person disregards this rule, the raid is a failure. I am not being overly dramatic, this is fact. If you run, two 
things can happen. If you run TO the camp, you bring a nice train of MOBs with you. Because of the increased aggro 
range, you WILL bring a train. When this happens, everyone will die, including you. You might even lose your 
corpse. For this reason, it is in YOUR best interest to stand and die, thereby increasing the chances of the 
success of the raid. If you run AWAY from camp, a phenomenon called chain-aggro happens and MOBs crawl out from 
under rocks and behind trees and get all stirred up, resulting in a mass of wandering MOBs. This will also get 
everyone killed. To reiterate, DO NOT RUN ANYWHERE - STAND AND DIE. If it makes you feel better, turn away from the 
computer while you die.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>B. Second cardinal rule - STAY TOGETHER IN CAMP. Do not wander even 5 steps away from everyone 
else. You need to get into a tight little ball with your friends. I don’t care if they smell.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>3. At this time, hopefully everyone has followed the above rules, and everyone is huddled in 
the camp, waiting for the onslaught. When the first wanderer comes by, it will aggro, and can aggro from near the 
portal. If you can see it, it could be in camp within 10 seconds. If you cant see it, it can be in camp in 10.6 
seconds. When the first MOB enters the camp, the main tank will acquire the target, attack, and call for assist. 
Everyone attack the same MOB. EVERYONE. Blasters blast, tanks tank, clerics heal, shamans togor and malosi, 
enchanters tashani.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>4. ADDs: If you are killing a MOB and see another come into the camp, shout ADD to ensure that 
everyone knows there are more MOBs. If the tank then chooses a new target, he will shout and you have to assist 
again to acquire the new target. For instance, if you are fighting a Shiverback, and a Scareling wanders into camp, 
the main tank will most likely switch to the Scareling, unless the ape is almost dead. The main tank will decide 
what the proper target is, and you need to follow the lead tank. Do not attempt to kite adds at this point.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>5. Teleports: As mentioned earlier, Scarelings can teleport you away from the camp. If this 
happens, regain you bearings, get the camp in sight, and then look around. Make 110% sure you have not aggroed any 
more MOBs. If you have been aggroed, STAND AND DIE. Do not run back to camp, as this will result in another 
train.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>6. Death: Eventually the clerics will run out of mana. The blasters will be out also. The tanks 
will start dropping one by one. Fight to the death. Every MOB killed on the initial break is a huge accomplishment. 
If you can get 4-5 MOBs dead on the first rush, consider yourself in. Might take a few more deaths, but you can 
get in. Another tactic that is also popular is to make sure you have two groups fighting at your first break camp 
with an evac druid in each group. You fight off as much stuff as you can until you know it can't go much further, 
then evac. This way you save the groups without having to do CR. Then you just buff up again outside, re-enter the 
gate (this time with less MOBs at the entrance) and repeat the cycle, evacing again if necessary.</FONT>

<A NAME="06">

<h3><FONT face=Arial>Subsequent Rushes</FONT></h3>

<p><FONT face=Arial>1. So you died. You land in either Ogguk or right outside the portal. If you land in Ogguk, 
get a SoW and get back to the portal. DO NOT ZONE IN. Before training the spectres to the portal, might be a nifty 
idea to be sure there and people there to derail the train.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>2. Get summoned: Get the mage to start summoning swords and food and water. About 5 food and 
water per person is fine, and either sword or modulating rod for a weapon. Sit down and start getting buffs 
together for the second try.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>3. Basically the same as the initial rush, when called in, proceed in an orderly fashion to 
the camp and get in a ball. Again, if you are attacked on the way, STAND AND DIE.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>4. Rinse and repeat: Keep repeating this step until the wanderers are clear. Conflicting 
reports, but I think there are 12 wanderers that need to be dispatched.</FONT>

<A NAME="07">

<h3><FONT face=Arial>Establishing the West Camp</FONT></h3>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Not really much to be said here, except that you must still follow the main 2 rules. This is 
not a time for exploration. You have killed the wanderers in the area, and your camp is relatively safe. If you 
wander, you WILL train, and trust me, there are still enough MOBs in the zone to kill every level 46 - 50 person 
on the server at once. Wanders basically consist of scarelings, shiverbacks, fetid fiends, spinechiller spiders, 
worry wraiths, and turmoil toads. The scarelings and undead MOBs can see invis and the scarelings have the largest 
aggro range.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>There are some people that will say a better camp area is the North Wall near the North West 
corner of the zone. It's a great idea in theory and it has its advantages but a lot of down sides as well. On the 
good side, if you can get people to the North wall, it's a safer spot, with no roamers most of the time. The down 
side is that you have to run through an entirely spawned zone to get there, which kind of sucks. Keep in mind that 
some of the stuff you're running through can't see through invis (like Tentacle Tormentors) but once something 
else sees you, you're toast. There is a high chance you will run into something else. There's also a theory that 
says people could camp out there in an empty zone and come back the next day when everything is spawned. That's a 
nice idea, but if you log on the next day and the clerics die during your raid, who's going to res the people? Now 
you're going to have to get somebody to the North wall from the gate (which is probably not clear) and you won't 
have a choice in the matter.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Yes, the West Wall isn't the easiest, but it's generally considered the best for CR and if 
you've ever sat through a ten hour CR session in fear, you know how important it is to make the corpses easily 
accessible.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Once the initial camp has been set up and you have some breathing space to work with, using 
Snare and Fear on MOBs can save people a lot of strife.</FONT>

<A NAME="08">

<h3><FONT face=Arial>Cazic Thule Says Your Name</FONT></h3>

<p><FONT face=Arial>When you see this, it means that Cazic Thule is kind of annoyed with the entire concept of 
people "raiding" his plane, and he decided to take matters into his own hands. If the person who gets the death 
touch was in the West camp at that time, Cazic Thule now is aggro on the entire camp and will begin to death touch 
someone every 30 seconds or so. When this happens, you will have to do one of two things:</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>If you are fighting something, kill it and kill it fast. After that, watch for the raid 
leader to call the CAMP command. When you see this, sit and camp, and pray you save your ass. Leave the game for 3 
minutes, then return to the game. This will clear the Cazic aggro on the party. If you are not fighting, just look 
for the camp command. Do not camp until requested to do so. The leader makes that decision, and you will look like 
a cowardly fool if you camp out with no command only to find that the person that caught the death touch was not in 
the camp. Save some embarrassment and wait for the signal.</FONT>

<A NAME="09">

<h3><FONT face=Arial>Clearing the Zone</FONT></h3>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Basically this just consists of the pull team going out and grabbing MOBs and dragging them 
back to the camp for a slaughter. Do not go after MOBs, let them come to you. If you see the puller run by with a 
huge train, do not attack the train. Let the pull team pick them off of the train one-by-one and take them to the 
camp. I repeat, do NOT attack the train.</FONT>

<A NAME="10">

<h3><FONT face=Arial>General Strategy on Pulling In Fear</FONT></h3>

<p><FONT face=Arial>As a puller, have a lot of magic resistance. The more the better but you'll have pretty good 
luck pulling with about 75 MR. If you can get an enchanter in your group to cast Group Resist Magic, that would be 
best. The main reason why this is important is because of the stuns from Gorgons, harm touches from Knights, and 
fears from Toads while pulling. All of these things can kill you fast if you're not paying attention.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Always prepare to die a lot. Just expect it to happen. If you can't take a death with a 
ressurection, just don't volunteer to pull. Especially if you've not been up there much. Your XP will fall down 
because most likely your pulling group won't be getting XP, just learn to live with it.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>If you think you have SUPER aggro on you and you better quit out while feigned, do it. Trust 
me, any experienced group of people won't complain about the 3 minutes that they have to wait while you're gone. 
When you feign pull and split off widely wandering MOBs, they might wander back near other MOBs, and when you 
stand up, they will ALL come. In the worst case, a MOB may be near CT and when you stand up you will get death 
touched. So reiterating again, if you think you are in big trouble, play it safe and /q while feigned. There's no 
reason to take such a large risk.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>If you have a monk in the group that is 51+ tell him/her to pull instead of anyone lower 
because stonestance will save sooooo many deaths that it's not even funny. A monk that is 50- will die so many 
more times. The moments that stonestance count the most is when your feign fails and you have 5 boogeys hitting 
you while you're standing there hoping for another chance to feign.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Glare lords and Worry Wraiths are casters and they can be a complete pain in the butt. 
Sometimes you don't even know that they're casting so you feign at the wrong time and they will break your feign 
and you will die. That's a fact of life. One way to help prevent this from happening is to always turn around and 
look back at the MOBs before you feign to the ground, so that you can sorta get a visual on what's going to happen. 
If you see a glare lord chasing you and then it suddenly stops, that means it's casting something so don't feign 
until you get hit with a spell.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Although it's nice to turn off spell effects when in the planes to reduce lag, as a puller 
DON'T do that. You will have problems pulling caster MOBs and you won't be able to have good judgement when 
feigning. Keep it on the "low" setting.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Don't ever let anyone in your group cast a spell on you no matter what unless you specifically 
tell them when and what spell. If you are feigned and someone casts a beneficial spell on you, it's fine. If you 
stand up with aggro and someone in the group casts a spell on you (heal, buff, see invis), you are all in deep 
trouble. IF you see this happen, figure out who casted on you FAST and tell them to run AWAY from the group and 
start camping out. If he is lucky he will camp out in time and live. If that person stays with the group, prepare 
to fight a train of MOBs. If he is unlucky a horde of MOBs will kill him, but at lEast 30 people don't have to 
die.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>If you ever fight Amy Knights, sometimes you will have to check loot after they are dead and 
log out, because they aggro Cazic himself about half the time.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>If Cazic is not up, the zone is much easier to pull. If you ever aggro Dracoliche when you 
didn't want to, quit out. He's not fun to toy with.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Always kill all the wanderers that you can see before you move the party anywhere. Sometimes it 
pays a lot to just stand in an open area and wait a couple minutes to see if wanderers come by. If they don't, then 
you can think about moving the party up a little to make the pulls easier on yourself.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Don't ever get too confident and move the group too quickly. You will be surprised by how many 
wanderers come by. If your group is doing so well that it seems they want more MOBs than you can pull, try bringing 
2 or 3 at a time. If you have good enchanters it shouldn't be a big problem.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Never ever train your group. Ressing you is 30 times faster than ressing everyone. Don't ever 
go near your group standing unless you are absolutely positive that you have no aggro. For example if you just got 
back from quitting out, it's probably safe to go back, get grouped again and get a couple buffs you might be 
missing. Otherwise don't do it because it's just risky and there's no reason to. Stay feigned for most of your 
time, it's just a safer bet.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Always chain pull if possible. It's safer and faster than trying to split MOBs. Anyone who 
has pulled the scareling tower will agree with me here.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>After you have pulled something, you need to get about halfway to the party and hit the MOB a 
couple times while you test to see what else you have aggroed. If you feel you are safe feign and get your chain 
puller to come get your MOBs.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Use third person views often to check what stuff is aggro on you while you're feigned BEFORE 
you tell your chainer to come get them.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>When you are the main puller, group with the event leader, an enchanter and a cleric to heal. 
The enchanter does not have to be the main enchanter because that would give the cleric too much work to do.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Always tell your event leader that you are looking for a pull before you go out for more, and 
don't ever ever pull anything just because someone requests it in a tell. Don't play favoritism, always do what you 
feel is most comfortable. In fact, people that keep shouting in /shout and /ooc to pull certain MOBs should be 
told to STFU.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>If you are the puller or chain puller, make sure you have something that gives you infra or 
ultra vision, like the ring from the High Priest is Sol A. Something that does not poof when you camp or /q. The 
ring (Glowing Stone Band) is not that hard to get, and is campable in one evening.</FONT>

<h3><FONT face=Arial>MOB Pull Order in Fear</FONT></h3>

<p><FONT face=Arial>This assumes you are breaking from the South West corner.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Once everyone is rezzed/buffed/ready, stay there for about 15-30 minutes killing any wanderers 
that come nearby. Once you feel that most of the wanderers have died, start looking around the portal area for any 
wanderers. Bring those back to the group and kill them.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Please remember that if at any time you see wanderers on the way to pull, bring those back to 
the group to kill off first before you go out again.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Then pull the fetid fiend house to the North. After that is cleared, go a little more North 
to find any other wanderers.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Then pull to the East along the South wall. You will see a couple towers and a house. In these, 
there are samhains, boogeymen, and scarelings. These are statics spawns along with a bunch of wanderers that will 
be there. You should probably chain pull this area, but make sure that when you feign you are still kinda far from 
the group, because otherwise they might see your group and train.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Once this area is done, go past the portal area and pull the tentacle terrors. After the 
tentacle terrors are dead and everyone is buffed, check for any last wanderers around. If all wanderers seem to be 
dead, pull Dracoliche and kill him.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Then go all the way up North and pull any last wanderers you see, but of course don't go past 
the fire wall.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Then go East along the South wall again and pull wanderers, until you can see the gorgon statue 
with gorgons flying all around it. Once you are free from wanderers, pull that gorgon area. Be careful to not run 
too close to the hills in the middle of the zone that Fright, Dread, and Terror are on. They will aggro if you go 
too close and they will cause Cazic to begin to death touching.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Once the gorgons are dead, pull the frightfinger house. Once those are dead, check for any last 
wanderers again.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Move the group East a little bit. Pull Dread and Terror to the group one hill at a time. Each 
of these will have 2 Amy knights or warriors with them.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>After those are dead, pull Fright and his 2 henchmen. Be careful about aggroing Cazic on this 
pull. Try to time the grab when Cazic is farther away.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Once that is done, another tougher part of the game comes into play because it is now time to 
pull the temple. Move your entire group to the NorthWest corner and situate them there. Then get your best necro 
and have him go to the portal. Have him get close to the temple and then cast harmshield on himself. While he is 
harmshielded, get him to run into the temple and aggro every MOB (hopefully at lEast all the knights) and get 
harmtouched. His harmshield should eat all the harmtouches and then have him (with SOW) run to the South wall with 
the MOBs on his tail. Once he's there, get him to gate out ASAP.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Hopefully he will live and the MOBs will be scattered. Once the MOBs start going back, run in 
there and aggro some of the amy's and kite them around the big hill that the portal is sitting on. Make wide circles. 
While you are kiting in circles, get another melee in your group, hopefully a monk, aggro a couple and bring them 
back to the group in the NW corner. Kill these while you are still kiting the Amy's on you. When those are dead, get 
the other monk to come get some more MOBs off of you until all the MOBs aggro on you are dead.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Once those that are aggro are dead, run back to the temple and pull some more. By this time if 
you did it right, none of the knights should have harm touches left and it should be a piece of cake. Pull them to 
the portal hill again and kite them around in circles like you were before. Once all the temple MOBs are dead, you 
are almost done.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Now you need to ask your friendly ranger what MOBs are still up, and pull them to the group 
until they are all dead. Watch out for Cazic's aggro and don't get too close to him to get a MOB.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Once you have pulled as many MOBs as you possible can without aggroing Cazic himself, get 
everyone to buff up. Once everyone is buffed, designate someone as the death touch sacrifice (usually a gnome) and 
rush Cazic.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>When your sacrifice gets there, he will be death touched first thing. If Cazic doesn't seem to 
be awake, have him cast on Cazic. That'll get his attention fast. Once the death touch has passed, kill Cazic.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>When Cazic is aggro, MOBs that are anywhere nearby will come after you. So if you haven't 
killed some MOBs yet, prepare to mez the train that comes when you are killing Cazic. Sometimes you'll have 1 glare 
lord that's still alive. No big deal when this happens, just kill CT and get a chanter to mez the glare.</FONT>

<h3><FONT face=Arial>Fighting Dracoliche</FONT></h3>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Big skeletal dragon, enough said. Before the Draco pull, you need to buff up as usual and 
throw on some sv disease and magic buffs. Kill the dragon, you probably have done something like this before. After 
the dragon is dead, wait for the CAMP command. When you see it, camp and return in however many minutes the leader 
specifies. Do not check the Draco for loot. Let the leader of the raid take care of this. The leader is experienced, 
knows what the Draco drops, can tell at a quick glance what is NO DROP and what is not, can loot the droppable items, 
and handle the situation. When you have safely killed the Draco, please do me a favor - Do not shout WHAT WAS THE 
LOOT?? and WHAT DID HE HAVE??? It really annoys everyone and you will find out soon enough. It is considerate to 
wait for everyone to be back into the Plane before you announce the loot.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Draco's special skills are an area effect Fear which is quite nasty. He also has an area effect 
DoT called Rotting Flesh that is poison based. Having a 100% poison resist will pretty much help you against this 
roar. He can also cast other necro spells like Shock of Poison. Make sure you CAMP after fighting Draco, he aggros 
Cazic Thule and Cazic will be death touching people throughout the fight as a result.</FONT>

<p><FONT face=Arial>Any pet class should have a pet summoned and buffed for fighting this dragon.</FONT>

<A NAME="13">

<h3><FONT face=Arial>Fighting Cazic Thule</FONT></h3>

<p><FONT face=Arial>To prepare, cancel all the buffs you have on and, when given the signal, place 4 disposable 
buffs (or "crap buffs") on yourself. My personal preference is to use J-Boots first, as you can quickly reactivate 
them after they are debuffed. At the command, begin normal buffs. Put Dead Man Floating or Levitate on as the 
final buff, as this negates his Gravity Flux damage. Wait for the call, and charge him and kill him. Not really 
much to it. Like dragons, casters want to wait until the halfway mark to begin casting on Cazic Thule while the 
tanks work it down for the first half. Cazic isn't very magic resistant, so casters are going to do really well 
here. He hits for 400 sometimes so he's a pretty rough melee MOB. He also death touches people every 30 seconds. 
If you have a lot of magic resistance, they're a slim chance you could survive this, but it's not bloody likely. 
Tanks are essential. They MUST interrupt him using bash, stun, etc. Casters, when not casting, have to stay out 
of melee range. Healers are an absolute must considering how much damage Cazic will do to the tanks and how long 
they have to fight him. He has the ability to dispell buffs as well, but the worst part of this is the MOBs in 
the zone running at you. That's right. The moment he's attacked, he will summon everything left in the zone at you. 
This is why you want to do Cazic last. You want to clear all the MOBs in the zone that you can away before taking 
him on. There's a big trick to doing Cazic though, and that's Fear. Cazic is extremely susceptible to Fear spells. 
If you keep him Feared and just plow him with large scale DoTs and such, you can't fail.</FONT>

<h3><FONT face=Arial>Epilogue</FONT></h3>

<p><FONT face=Arial>You have demolished the entire Plane of Fear. Give yourself a pat on the back. Please 
congratulate the winners of the prizes. Even if you really wanted the item, how would you like it if someone 
frowned when you won something? If all went well, you can wait for respawns. The respawn cycle on MOBs in PoF is 
13-14 hours with Cazic and Draco set to one week. If you want to farm the zone, head back to the West camp and 
proceed to pull MOBs as they pop for the next week or so until a patch. Or, for something a little more fun, wait 
until tomorrow and do the entire thing again. It is much more rewarding to go into a place where the odds are 
against you and overcome the odds, than to sit for hours and hours arguing about loot and waiting for one poor MOB 
to spawn so 40 people can beat the crap out of it. I hope this helps some people that want to go to Fear 
understand what is going on there. I hope this takes some of the fear out of the Plane of Fear and removes the 
panic factor which can ruin everyone's time, as well as kill everyone.</FONT>
