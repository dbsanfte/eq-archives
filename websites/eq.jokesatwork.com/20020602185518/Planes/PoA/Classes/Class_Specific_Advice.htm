<h1>class specific advice</h1>
<p>Standard raid practices normally apply in sky. Here is some sky specific 
advice, and a bit of emphasis on standard raid advice. </p>
<h2>Druid</h2>
<ul>
  <li>keep improved camo memmed, before any campout, try to invis first so that 
  you can come back quick as a scout </li>
  <li>don't forget to use ro's fiery sundering and fixation of ro, good debuffs 
  (one druid should be assigned to each) </li>
  <li>assist heal </li>
</ul>
<h2>Shaman</h2>
<ul>
  <li>standard raid procedures, buff and slow. Malosini if able </li>
  <li>not much to do on boss fights except heal </li>
</ul>
<h2>Cleric</h2>
<ul>
  <li>keep both invulns memmed, especially on azarack's, spiroc, and bzzazzt
  </li>
  <li>assist heals will save the day. </li>
  <li>remember group heals on AE mobs </li>
  <li>bind at meeting place (tox spires?) in case of wipeout </li>
  <li>Bring a few invis potions, for CRs and campouts </li>
</ul>
<h2>Enchanter (from Pini)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Keep everyone hasted. With stacking problems with Shissar worked out, 
  everyone should have it whether they are asking for it or not. Especially on 
  bosses. </li>
  <li>Crowd Control by Isle
  <ol>
    <li>Thunder Spirits can be dazzled on bad pulls. Boss can be dazzled also 
    after debuffs. </li>
    <li>Azaracks is all about crowd control. Dazzle works fine, but I'd 
    recommend tashing first </li>
    <li>Taj has some things that need kintaz. Gusts and Clouds are ok to mez 
    even without tash. The spirited harpies, eyes, and gorgolasks can require 
    kintaz if they are high enough level. If your puller is good, you may not 
    need to mez anything at all when all singles come dribbling in. </li>
    <li>The horse split can be dazzled. More than likely, it isn't worth it if 
    you don't have Malo/Mala though. (<i>Adawen's note: This is from Pini's 
    perspective at 56, without the level 57 tash spell. I believe a 60 enchanter 
    will be able to keep one mezzed with some work.</i>) </li>
    <li>Spirocs is all about crowd control also. Vanqs can be raptured. The 
    little spirocs can be dazzled. I'd recommend tash first. </li>
    <li>The only things worth mezzing here are the three original bees. They are 
    50 and can be mezzed easily once mala/malo and tash are on. </li>
    <li>The only thing that can be mezzed are the Undine Spirits. They can be 
    dazzled easily. </li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>For bosses, it's good to have Rune up. You never know when you might save 
  the day by filling in gaps between real heals. </li>
  <li>Use your pet when it's gonna help even though you hate it. Bosses that AE 
  will agro your pet and it'll get in some hits before it dies. /cheer for it 
  while it lives. </li>
  <li>Getting everything slowed is a big key to making sky go well. Make sure 
  everything is tashed, and remember your slow is pretty good - help the shaman 
  out if you're not doing CC. (Adawen) </li>
</ul>
<h2>Magician</h2>
<ul>
  <li>mala if able, malosini everything </li>
  <li>watch enrage and your pet. Especially on multi-mob enrage fight fights 
  where you will kill several mobs in a row that will enrage like in bzzazzt and 
  drake isle. No use for your pet to die needlessly. </li>
  <li>Only level 49+ air pets and epic pets are summonable in sky. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Necro</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The basics of course: keep clerics and shaman with mana, summon lots of 
  corpses </li>
  <li>Be sure to feign death if things start to look bad. A FD necro can save a 
  lot of time from CR from a wipeout. Make sure you have an essense emerald for 
  this. </li>
  <li>bind at meeting place (tox spires?) in case of wipeout </li>
  <li>watch enrage and your pet. Especially on multi-mob enrage fight fights 
  where you will kill several mobs in a row that will enrage like in bzzazzt and 
  drake isle. No use for your pet to die needlessly. </li>
  <li>Use root to help in crowd control intensive situations (azarack, spiroc, 
  bzzazzt). </li>
</ul>
<h2>Wizard</h2>
<ul>
  <li>ALWAYS leave something on your corpse if you die to prevent you from 
  having to suicide later to bring folks. </li>
  <li>Similarly, you should never loot a key unless it is going to rot have one. 
  When the leader says &quot;Casters loot keys&quot;, he doesn't mean you. The reason is 
  you may have to jump off to bring people up and lose your key. </li>
  <li>Understand how the mechanics of bringing up reinforcements work. Think 
  about this some. </li>
  <li>On bosses make sure and save a couple lures for when enrage hits. I've 
  seen raids get a boss to enrage, then fail after all their melee die to enrage 
  and wizard's oom. </li>
  <li>Use root to help in crowd control intensive situations (azarack, spiroc, 
  bzzazzt). </li>
</ul>
<h2>Warrior</h2>
<ul>
  <li>make sure you know what your job is. Are extras going to be tanked or 
  mezzed? </li>
  <li>Don't use defensive on mobs that DT. </li>
  <li>If you are 55+, never waste a disc doing your crip disc or such. Unless 
  you are sure you're never going to need defensive or riposte, keep them ready, 
  you'll never know when it will keep you alive in sky. Offensive disciplines 
  are useful on some of the bosses. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Monk</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If camp is called, FD and scout so leader will know when to call all 
  clear. Bring pumice to dispell pull the avenging gazer miniboss on Gorgalusk, 
  best way to get him single. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Rogue</h2>
<ul>
  <li>assist and kill, try to avoid tanking if possible. </li>
  <li>Stay alive and avoid DTs. You are the one doing all the damage. </li>
  <li>Be ready to use your dodge disc on big hitting mobs on Bzzazzt and Drake 
  and Hand. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Ranger</h2>
<ul>
  <li>assist and kill, try to avoid tanking if possible. </li>
  <li>A Ranger is often the best slower in sky. :) Rangers should always use 
  that Earthcaller except on lure only bosses. I've seen ranger slow mobs that 
  the 60 shaman gave up. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Paladin and Shadow Knight</h2>
<ul>
  <li>often employed as assist if low on warriors. </li>
  <li>SKs with summon corpse are nice to have as backup to summon a small coffin 
  necro if for some reason your raid loses its necros. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bard</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Debuff with Occlusions on high MR mobs. </li>
  <li>I often put bard in boring but highly effect mana battery group with 2-3 
  necros. </li>
</ul>
