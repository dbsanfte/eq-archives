    Lendiniara the Keeper says 'Greetings Ayama . I am the keeper of relics. If 
    you are brave I have tasks to test your might and perhaps rewards. <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'what rewards' <br>
    <br>
    Lendiniara the Keeper says 'One should ask of the tasks before worrying 
    about rewards Dark Elf. <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'what tasks' <br>
    <br>
    Lendiniara the Keeper says 'Enter into the halls of testing to complete 
    these tasks. Seek out the ancient ones inside and see if your might is as 
    great as theirs and fear not, those who you slay will be returned to the 
    temple by the gift of Veeshan's great power. I have three tasks, which any 
    may complete, as well as a request of both the <br>
    arcane and the strong. <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'what request of the three' <br>
    <br>
    Lendiniara the Keeper says 'Tears from the cursed you much seek for each 
    task. The test of the Ruby Tear, the test of the Platinum Tear and the test 
    of the Emerald Tear await all who <br>
    wish to partake of them. <br>
    <br>
    You say, 'what test of the platinum tear' <br>
    <br>
    Lendiniara the Keeper says 'Seek the platinum tear and three symbols to bind 
    its powers to a bracelet. The black symbol to add raw power, the serrated 
    symbol to enchant its powers and the runed symbol to hold the powers to the 
    bracelet. </td>
