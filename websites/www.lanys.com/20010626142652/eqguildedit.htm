      By : Jumin
    </address>
    </center></div><p>&nbsp;</p>
    <address>
      <font color="#C0C0C0">Now that my Everquest days are pretty much numbered, being an old
      burnout that has managed to keep playing since the begining over a year ago I would like
      to tell a story.&nbsp; Not just any story&nbsp; it has both good and bad endings. It not a
      tale of a heroic leader or a brilliant player. It is just a simple story of a guild on the
      Lanys server that once strived to greatness that still has honarable reminants on the
      sever today. I hope this story can help any of you struggleing leaders out there or
      prehaps just give you a little entertainment and maybe a fond memory. </font>
    </address>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <address>
      <font color="#C0C0C0">It all started on day three of the server a couple of guys from
      another sever got together and decide form a guild built on strong principles of
      freindship and honor. We called the guild Order of the Parrot for our main founder and
      first elected leader Quinin, who happened to be one of the biggest Jimmy Buffet fans I
      ever knew. The other two of us became officers Kyndig and Jumin. </font>
    </address>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <address>
      <font color="#C0C0C0">Well still being in a power level mode I set ot to gain levels as
      fast as possible.&nbsp; I then began to run in to other Power levelers and invited them
      not really screening or bothering to get to know any of them. Kyndig being more of a
      roleplayer went out and played in many groups but never asked anybody that I know of
      prehaps his standards were to high or he was mistakeing the suden influx of players as me
      doing a good job.&nbsp; Qunin on the other hand invited one person who later became the
      only original member ther pretty much from start to finish Liat .&nbsp; After our first
      week we could boast almost 30 members and held out first meeting pretty standard for a
      newbie guild. The location was great nice and central since none of us could Tele yet. On
      the ramp to High Hold of course about twelve of us died getting there but crap happens
      right? Here a few more officers were elected I can only remember one name of the 3 and
      that would be Hardee a shaman. </font>
    </address>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <address>
      <font color="#C0C0C0">Then next few days went ok we kept growing as I hit the 20s Qunins
      showings seemed to slow to a trickle. Then Later stopped as I hit level 24 or so. He told
      me work and CPU problems were the reasons via E-mail so I continued do what I did. Till
      after a week or so. Seeing nothing was really uniting the guild the oficers and I set out
      to get every member no matter the level a magic wepon. Every thing took off new members
      began to flock to our ranks but our interview skills still lacked. And we soon noticed
      several new members dropping out day after getting a magic wep.</font>
    </address>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <address>
      <font color="#C0C0C0"> About a week later it was starting to become pretty accepted Qunin
      was not comming back.&nbsp; Our membership of about 60 at this time fell to about 40 as
      the leadership of the guild became a major issue.&nbsp; During this time Kyndig vanished
      as well leaving me a soloist and a power leveler as one of the 3 remaining officers. After
      days of guild say about the subject I pettioned a GM to preside over an election one prob
      though I was the only nominee. The Gm made me leader and I promoted a fresh new batch of
      officers to help manage the guild. A few days later Qunin showed up to say good bye and
      good luck. </font>
    </address>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <address>
      <font color="#C0C0C0">Now a new web site became the problem&nbsp; nobody in the guild
      wanted to do a web site for the guild&nbsp; . Since our comunication lacked we had a hard
      time growing during this stage of our exsistance.&nbsp; Finnally I figured it out myself
      and started a site.</font>
    </address>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <address>
      <font color="#C0C0C0"> Besides a few learning woes as a new leader we began to grow again
      and rather quickly with in 2 weeks of the site we had almost 80 members. </font>
    </address>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <address>
      <font color="#C0C0C0">We did several things to encourage guild activity. The usual events
      and raids as well as quests and a very large ongoing level data base that help greatly by
      making it very easy to identify the guilds needs. </font>
    </address>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <address>
      <font color="#C0C0C0">Again our leadership faultered as the number of low levels those
      under 20 out-numbered our high levels above 30 by almost 10 to 1 .&nbsp; Many remembered
      the days of the free magic items and began to harass our high Lv.s for these things.
      Tentions began to rise and bitter high levels and low levels began to leave some were
      kicked out . But most were not. Also at this time Rumors of one of the guild officers
      being one of the biggest KSing spawn crashing jerks on the server began to surface. I
      relucktanty faced him about this and he left the next day taking 3 of his high level
      friends with him.&nbsp; By this time our membership has shrunk back to just above 40
      again. Having only 2 officers left I made 3 more of these I remember 2 Wrathamon and Wrath
      both took a instant intrest in thier posts and began working to fix the guilds problems. </font>
    </address>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <address>
      <font color="#C0C0C0">I must give Wrathamon credit he was truly a visonary we all decide a
      on a grouping system that kept the whole guild balanced and put it in place as well as
      rules and enforcement measures. The guild began to grow again.&nbsp; It wasnt long before
      our membership hit over 100 and then a waiting list was constructed. But to no avail we
      could not recruit and keep High levels above 40. At this time a guy named Edvardo was
      asked to join he is a person of great signifigance that will be mentioned later. </font>
    </address>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <address>
      <font color="#C0C0C0">Soon Wrathamon wed a member of bloodsong named Lilasie.&nbsp; About
      a week later her great guild and several other large guilds collapsed to the big Ebay sell
      off before Varant offically band the selling of accounts. Since I adventured with Lil and
      liked her I made her an officer as soon as I could talk her into it. Soon the guild was
      getting its high level members most came with Lil from blood song and a few came from
      other guilds.&nbsp; This was our hay day the guild reached almost 120 members with a
      waiting list almost 20 long. This lasted for almost a month . </font>
    </address>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <address>
      <font color="#C0C0C0">Then it all broke loose at once it seemed. First Wrathamon
      &nbsp; pretty much left the server. Then a huge Same sex marriage thing was invented by a
      preson hating the guild to cause the obvious scandles. Next the officers began to bicker
      to the point I was forced to choose between them. We lost almost 40 members around this
      time and worst of all for the guild I began to loose intrest as being leader was becomeing
      quite a chore. </font>
    </address>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <address>
      <font color="#C0C0C0">I promoted a few more officers since we were down to 2 active ones
      again and we began to rebuild again to the point of about 100 members then the worst thing
      that could happen to a guild that is fragile from current change. My internet went down
      for a week. I came back to about 80 members. Much bickering and Many of my high level
      friends in the guild were thinking of quiting the game.&nbsp;&nbsp; I patched things up as
      good as best I could and we got things moving again. </font>
    </address>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <address>
      <font color="#C0C0C0">Finally we all got together to talk about the Lv probs again as the
      guild was dividing itself into high and low lv factons again. At this time I decided it
      best to seperate the two but still give the benifits to the low levels they always had.
      Our Recruitment problems for high level members now came down to 1 question what about
      Planes Raids? Well the guild divided into level groups wasnt set up to handle the planes
      by its self so we made high lv membership totally open. </font>
    </address>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <address>
      <font color="#C0C0C0">Tired of the bickering and the game itself I announed I was handing
      over leadership soon .&nbsp; With that very anouncement I put this splinter guild into
      action The Twilight Circle this guild was made up of members under lv 30 as officers to
      recruit stable members to become parrots later on. However I think the promotion system
      was a little too elaborate and no body but its creator me really knew how to make it work.
      &nbsp; It looked like every thing was gonna work out and the guild would be saved and
      strong ready for a new leader. </font>
    </address>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <address>
      <font color="#C0C0C0">I then asked that elctions be comenced while I was gone for three
      days to move in real life. I&nbsp; came back and no leader had been decided upon and wose
      yet more than half of the parrots had left thinking I quit&nbsp; the game. Twilight was
      thriving&nbsp; though knowing nothing of the Parrots problems their numbers swelled to
      just under 40 with the great Leadership of Edvardo.</font>
    </address>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <address>
      <font color="#C0C0C0"> I then began to have real life issues again that led to to be gone
      for 3 or 4 more days only to come back to 20 or so parrots tired of the game I transfered
      leadership to the first parrot I could find and same with the offical Twilight Leadership.
      I have been told the Order of the Parrot disbanded three days later. However Twilight
      still lives on as a stong guild on the lanys server. I proud to say they have taken all
      that was goood about the parrots with them and left most of the bad.&nbsp; Under the
      careful leadership of Edvardo Im sure they will prosper. </font>
    </address>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <address>
      <font color="#C0C0C0">To all of you former Parrots and current members of Twilight . Thank
      you,&nbsp; it has been a great run. I hope your brief stent of time with me was a positive
      one. Good Luck to you all....
