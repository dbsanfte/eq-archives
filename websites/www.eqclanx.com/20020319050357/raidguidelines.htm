              <font face="Arial" size="2">General guidelines on how to run a
              planes raid (these are not listed in order of importance as all
              these are important).&nbsp; These guideslines are being updated
              constantly - please email comments or suggestion to the Clan X
              Officers.&nbsp;</font>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Well its time to make
                sure that everyone understands how things have to run to keep
                everyone alive and well without any bickering and arguing during
                our upcoming raids.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For those of you who have
                been on large scale raids before that have been well run, this
                will be very obvious to you and make a lot of sense. For those
                that have not it will seem like a lot of sense but perhaps once
                in the raid it you may have to stop and think about some of it
                to keep any tempers under control.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So I will start off with
                asking a couple questions and answer them myself.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#9999FF">Why
                do we go on large-scale raids?</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To have fun and
                excitement, and for loot.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you thought exp was in
                there you are mistaken, once we hit planes don&#146;t be surprised
                if you come back most of the time with less exp then what you
                went up with. For a raid to be fun low deaths are very helpful
                as dying is not a lot of fun, although they can be, so it is
                very important that everyone understand that we are going to get
                some good items for the people in our alliance.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Loot will drop on these
                raids and we will be posting which items drop there after and by
                whom so everyone understands how things have to work to keep
                things fair, and there is no mistaken looting. But if you
                don&#146;t agree with the</font><font face="ZapfHumnst BT" size="2">
              </font><a href="lootrules.htm" style="color: #FFFFFF"> <font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2"> loot rules</font> </a><font face="ZapfHumnst BT" size="2">
              </font><font face="Arial" size="2"> just look at it from the other
                side of the coin and see if you were the one rolling on an item
                would you want yourself rolling on it too.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When a guild or an
                alliance start to do bigger things and start getting nice items
                there is bound to be some loot envy, and people will be jealous
                of others who win things and you will be looking at your
                inventory cursing how unfair it is (not that I have done this)
                when a good friend or great alliance mate just won an ass
                kicking item. At this point don&#146;t get mad and stay how unfair
                it is or how many times you have shown up and you still have not
                gotten anything. We are just getting started and EVERYONE will
                be getting cool items in time, unfortunately we can not get
                everyone everything they want right off the bat. So don&#146;t
                worry if you don&#146;t get anything or go someplace that nothing
                you want drops at, we WILL be doing more raids and events so
                everyone will get theirs in due time.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Once we are in the raid
                it is going to be very important that you listen and keep you
                group leader up to date on your mana buffs and over all
                readiness so he can report to the raid leader if his group is
                good to go or not.</font></p>
                <ul>
                <font size="2">
                  <li>
                    <p><font face="Arial">Always know who the main and secondary assist are and what
                    assist your group will be using.  Often everyone will be using the main assist with the
                    secondary assist as a backup however, there are times when the raid will be
                    handling 2-3 mobs at once to lessen the loads on the chanters.  If this is
                    the case make sure you are using the correct assist and if you are unsure
                    of your assist ask the group leader.&nbsp; In the confusion that is bound to happen everyone will
                have to make /assist name rather then just /assist.</font></li>
                  <li>
                    <p><font face="Arial">When the pull comes into camp assist then engage the mob and re assist
                    a few seconds later incase the main assist has changed.  Attacking a mob
                    that a chanter is trying to mez will not make you a favorite of the enchanter.</font></li>
                  <li>
                    <p><font face="Arial">If a mob attacks you from the pull don't fight back. STAY on&nbsp;<br>
                    target.  The enchanters will be doing crowd control and will get the mob
                    off you.  If you don't see that happening let the group know so the crowd
                    controller in the group can take care of the mob.</font></li>
                  <li>
                    <p><font face="Arial">Never use shout on a raid that is reserved for the raid leader and the
                    person in charge of groups.  Any communication up to the raid leader that
                    needs to be done should be done by your group leader.</font></li>
                  <li>
                    <p><font face="Arial">Keep your group informed about your ready status.  Let the group know
                    when you need buffs are low on mana etc.</font></li>
                  <li>
                    <p><font face="Arial">Only group leaders check kills and let the correct people know what loot
                    if any is there.</font></li>
                  <li>
                    <p><font face="Arial">Never loot anything unless you are told to.</font></li>
                  <li>
                    <p><font face="Arial">Cast on mobs from melee range this is more important on large boss mobs
                    than the smaller pulls but as a general rule cast almost in melee range.</font></li>
                  <li>
                    <p><font face="Arial">NO WANDERING. If you have
                this sudden urge to go take a peak at a cool looking statue or
                see what&#146;s around the next corner. DON&#146;T. Stay with your
                group and move where the group or raid leader says.&nbsp; No sightseeing during the raid.  Stay with the group at all times.  If
                    you want to go sight seeing wait till the raid is over and the zone is clear.</font></li>
                  <li>
                    <p><font face="Arial">Wait till a mob hits 75% health before you dot or nuke.  Nothing will
                    get a raid killed faster than someone who dots a mob right off only to have
                    targets change and one pissed of doted mob that the chanters cant
                    mez.</font></li>
                  <li>
                    <p><font face="Arial">No pets until you are told its ok.  If the raid leader says no pets&nbsp;<br>
                    then no pets and no argument.</font></li>
                  <li>
                    <p><font face="Arial">If you have a pet up keep a close eye on him.  The second you don't see
                    him or cant him off a mob kill him.  If your group leader or raid leader
                    tells you to kill your pet then kill it no questions.</font></li>
                  <li>
                    <p><font face="Arial">Expect to wait.  Wait on groups to be formed.  Wait on the&nbsp;<br>
                    insertion.  Wait on mobs to be pulled.  Wait to get a rez.&nbsp;
                    Nothing goes quickly on a planes raid until everyone has a good deal of experience in
                    that plane.</font>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you need to leave the raid for any reason let your group leader know.</font>

                <li>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Don't expect to get much loot if any.  The loot drops on the planes
                  have been upped from what I understand but that is no guarantee you will
                  not see 4 of the same pieces drop.  I have been on fear raids to see 3
                  pairs of blighted boots drop and that is it.  It takes time to get good
                  loot on average expect to go to 8+ plane raids to get a decent set of gear
                  if there are more than 4 of your class on the raid.  It takes time don't
                  get impatient.</font>
