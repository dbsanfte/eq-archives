                warn you about this when you start your characters.&nbsp; It is
                a change that can either drive you to attain level 60, or make

                people get items (epics) and they don't get anything of their
                own.&nbsp; They get impatient when raid leaders spend time

                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Basically, the answer is
                simple.&nbsp; It no longer requires only ONE group to take down
                a mob, or to succeed in a zone.&nbsp; It oftentimes take 2 or 3
                or 8 full groups of people to succeed in a certain area of
                Norrath.&nbsp; The Planes of Hate, Fear, Growth, Sky, etc. were
                all designed for RAIDING - meaning multiple groups of people
                must go in order to succeed.&nbsp;</font></p>

                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This brings with it lots of
                issues.&nbsp; Experience only goes to one group of people
                instead of to all that participate in killing a single
                mob.&nbsp; The loot that drops here is rare, so if 54 people
                show up to a raid, it is not likely that 54 pieces of loot are
                going to drop.&nbsp; It is VERY VERY common for people to go on
                a planar raid, and come back with NO loot and with LESS
                experience than when they left (because you can die a lot in the
                Planes).&nbsp; This causes SO MUCH FRUSTRATION - don't blame it
                on your raid leaders - Verrant designed it this way.</font></p>

                    last 45 levels.&nbsp; You would be more inclined to join a <b>FAMILY

                a lot!&nbsp; Guild chat is usually a constant flurry of chatter
                and jokes.&nbsp; Impromptu little raids tend to spawn up all
                over the place.&nbsp; More often than not, you will see many of
                the higher-level toons in this guild helping out the
                lower-levels.&nbsp; These guilds like to get together for Nekkid

                helpful to their fellow guild members.&nbsp; Doing things on the
                spur of the moment is commonplace - they don't live much by
                schedules.&nbsp; There generally aren't a lot of rules to follow
                in the <b>Family Guild</b>.&nbsp; The focus of these guilds is
                to enjoy yourself, and rules such as raiding requirements or
                time you spend in Norrath generally gets in the way of the
                fun.&nbsp; In addition, the participation requirements for
                leadership in a <b>Family Guild</b> are not nearly as strict as
                they are in a <b>Raiding Guild</b>.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Weaknesses of the <b>Family
                Guild</b> lie in its &quot;End-Game Progress&quot;.&nbsp; Due to
                a lax attitude on raid participation or punctuality, <b>Family
                Guilds</b> have a consistent problem in making raids work.&nbsp;
                Since there are generally no requirements for attendance, larger
                raids are difficult to schedule appropriately, harder to get
                started, and even harder to finish successfully.&nbsp; Members
                of <b>Family Guilds</b> can go and come as they please, so
                having the necessary people there to run the raid from start to
                finish is a seldom occurrence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Because of this inability to
                have consistently successful raids, the turnover rate (or rate
                at which members leave for other guilds) is relatively high for <b>Family
                Guilds</b>.&nbsp; Many high level people are attracted to the
                family atmosphere of these guilds, but frustrated at their lack
                of in-game progress, and will leave to find other guilds that
                can provide the loot and new zones that they are hoping to
                experience.&nbsp; <b>Family Guilds</b> can get very put-out with
                this, claiming that those who leave are &quot;obsessed with
                loot&quot;, and &quot;good riddance to you anyway!&quot; (sounds
                like your mother-in-law, doesn't it?).&nbsp; But the <b>Family
                Guilds</b> that have this attitude have failed to notice that
                Verrant designed the game for incredible loots at this level,
                and encourages characters to attain the most they possibly
                can.&nbsp; <b>Family Guilds</b> need to understand that if they
                do not provide their members a way to get their epic weapons or
                keys to the best zones in the game and the best loot, that <b>THEY
                WILL LOSE HIGH LEVEL PEOPLE</b>.&nbsp; It is just the nature of
                the beast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
