              <font color="#9999FF"> /report &lt;toon's name here&gt;</font>. The text is then sent to the GM's for review. FOLLOW UP the report command with a petition. Both of these things done will get results, albeit usually slow responses :=)</font></li>

          Game Difficulties</b></font>
          <p><font size="2" face="ZapfHumnst BT,sans-serif">Ok, I hate being LD,
          even though it happens from Time to time to the best of us much of it
          CAN be prevented! Read this to find out how... even you guys who think
          you have everything all set up right, there is some good info in here.<br>
          <br>
          Prologue: A little info on how lag works on how it effects the game:<br>
          <br>
          There are basically 2 different types of lag when playing EQ- network
          lag and computer hardware lag.<br>
          <br>
          If when you turn your character the screen is choppy and jumpy (I.E.
          you are getting a low number of frames per second), esp. around a
          bunch of people that is computer hardware lag and you can correct that
          by screwing with the settings as outlined above.<br>
          <br>
          If you are experiencing lag inbetween when you cast a spell or attack
          a mob and when the spell starts casting or you start attacking, that
          is network lag. There's not a whole lot you can do with that, esp with
          120 people in the zone.<br>
          <br>
          Serverfilter will help some and tweaking your datarate.txt may a lot-
          but there isn't much more you can do other than get a better ISP or,
          more likely, buy VI a new ISP and some new server boxes.<br>
          <br>
          One important thing-- Computer hardware lag can create Network lag!
          Esp for people on dialup who use win-modems!<br>
          <br>
          The reason for that is if you are stressing your processor by running
          the game, your processor has less overhead to run the software which
          emulates a hardware modem... I know this sounds confusing, but just
          trust me on this- fix ALL the lag it may reduce the other kind in
          turn.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          1. Settings in game<br>
          This is the easy stuff. Go into the game and go to the options
          section. Turn everything off.<br>
          <br>
          Start with the chat filters, turn off all occ/shout/auc that we are
          not using. Turn off casting messages unless you NEED to see them.<br>
          <br>
          Next go to your display properties- Turn your particle effects off,
          turn level of detail off, turn 3d sky off, turn PC names off, turn
          your clipping plane down as far as you can stand it. There that was
          easy wasn't it?<br>
          <br>
          2. Your eqclient.ini file is your friend.<br>
          This is a segment from my client file.. I have edited out the parts
          that don't matter.<br>
          <br>
          LoadArmor17=FALSE<br>
          LoadArmor18=FALSE<br>
          LoadArmor19=FALSE<br>
          LoadArmor20=FALSE<br>
          LoadArmor21=FALSE<br>
          LoadArmor22=FALSE<br>
          LoadArmor23=FALSE<br>
          This is how you disable all your velious graphics, this is a MUST.<br>
          <br>
          ShowDynamicLights=0<br>
          ShowSpellEffects=0<br>
          0=no and 1=yes on the previous settings, Dynamic lights and spell
          effects make a huge hit on your system performance-- TURN THEM OFF.<br>
          <br>
          ServerFilter=1<br>
          The server filter was specifically designed to help lag issues by
          filtering out stuff you have turned off at the server rather than at
          you computer (Others hits, damage shields, your misses , etc..) This
          absolutely MUST be on.<br>
          <br>
          VideoModeBitsPerPixel=16<br>
          more bits = more work your computer has to do. This should be at 16,
          if this is currently set at 32 and you try it is 16 and EQ won't load
          switch it back-- some video cards have a problem with EQ in 16 bit
          mode for some reason.<br>
          <br>
          UseD3DTextureCompression=TRUE<br>
          This can slow down loading to the game between the server select and
          character select screens, but can also improve performance-- This
          won't work with Voodoo video cards, it'll just make things look funky
          so leave it flagged as FASLE for them.<br>
          <br>
          3. MOST IMPORTANT-- Datarate.txt!!!<br>
          In your EQ directory there is a file named &quot;DataRate.txt&quot;,
          open this file in notepad or another text editor. There is a number in
          it, the default is 5.0, this is the allowable data packet size, in
          kilobits, your client will accept from the EQ server. Its the number
          on the right of the lag-o-meter on your screen in game.<br>
          <br>
          If the number on the right goes over the number in your DataRate.txt
          file x1000k (5.0 in the file = 5000 on the lag meter), you will
          probably be disconnected.<br>
          <br>
          The solution to this problem is to increase the number in the
          DataRate.txt file. The setting you should try is dependent on what
          type of connection you have.<br>
          <br>
          For those with dialup connections most have found 7.0 to work best,
          drop it to 6.0 if your connection becomes unstable.<br>
          <br>
          For those with adsl or cable and other &quot;broadband&quot;
          connections under 500kbs a setting of 8.0 to 9.0 work fine, but I have
          had people tell me that they had connection problems at 9.0 *shrug*.<br>
          <br>
          For those with adsl/cable/t1/etc.. over 500kbs a setting of 9.0
          doesn't seem to ever cause a problem.<br>
          <br>
          I have seen reports of people setting it as high as 100.0, but Verant
          doesn't recommend a setting higher than 9.0.<br>
          <br>
          I personally have mine set at 100 with no problems.. I Highly
          recommend a very high setting for big raids! you can scale it back to
          7 or 9 for xp groups but a large number will drastically increase your
          chances of getting through an uber encounter without LDing. Some say
          that it makes no difference beyond a setting of 10.. well if thats the
          case, do 100 anyway-- it can't hurt.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Here is the flipside to datarate.txt-- the higher this is set, the
          more likely you are to have PL issues which in turn cause you to crash
          while zoning, so you may want to tweak it back down for xp/small
          groups.<br>
          <br>
          4. Dbg.txt sucks!<br>
          If you look in your EQ folder you will see a file called dbg.txt. This
          a debugger log and if you have even the slightest fubar in the way EQ
          works with your hardware, even if you don't notice it when it happens,
          there is a report generated and appended to this file. Over time this
          file can get HUGE-- it serves no purpose other than trouble shooting
          and opening a 50 mb file every time EQ has a brain fart can drag your
          system down big time! Delete it!<br>
          <br>
          5. Configuring hardware<br>
          Things to check on your computer to make sure it is in tip top gaming
          condition:<br>
          <br>
          A: Download and install the latest drivers. Video card and sound card
          companies are constantly releasing new drivers, these can make a
          really really big difference in your system performance-- (I.E I got
          about a 40% increase in my performance with the latest drivers from
          Nvidia) If you are using the original drivers that came with your card
          you need to upgrade them now! Check with your video/sound card company
          for the latest drivers and instructions on how to install them.<br>
          <br>
          B: Make you machine a network server. Right click on my computer &gt;
          properties &gt; performance &gt; filesystem and change the setting
          there to network server.<br>
          <br>
          C: Turn on DMA!!!: Right click my computer &gt; properties &gt; device
          manager&gt; select you hard drive(s)&gt; properties&gt;settings.
          Enable DMA. This is probably the number 1 cause of poor computer
          gaming performance. If you use Win2k the process is a little
          different, but there is a guide in the windows help to walk you
          through it.<br>
          <br>
          D: Check you AGP Aperture (Only if you have an AGP video card):<br>
          Restart your computer and go into your BIOS, look around for your AGP
          aperture settings.. change it to twice the amount of video ram you
          have. I.E if you have a 32 MB video card, set it at 64.<br>
          <br>
          E: Prepare your hardware: RAM is cheap-- if you don't have at least
          128MBs (preferably 256) go buy some it is cheap as dirt right now. If
          your processor is less than 500 MHZ, you should seriously think about
          upgrading, a 650MhZ duron is only 28 bucks on www.pricewatch.com and a
          decent FIC motherboard can be had for under 60 bucks. Video cards are
          going down in price as well.<br>
          <br>
          F: Prepare your software: Turn off all running programs when you play
          EQ-- this means kill ICQ, Kazaa, email programs, real player, spinner,
          Aim or whatever.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          I know this seems like a lot, and some of it might not be explained
          well enough for average joe user to do on his own but it is very
          important that you do these things if you want to game and have fun
          doing it. LD = boring</font>
