              Absor's Update
              
              Hello again!
              
              Welcome to another edition of the Harpy's Head Herald. EverQuest               is all about adventure. Sometimes we take the adventure off the               computer screen and into real life. If you've ever wondered what               goes on at the Fan Faire, or been curious about how your fellow               players act in real life, well we've got something for you. We have               a short               video taken at the Dallas Fan Faire, so check it out to get               a glimpse at the fun of these events. 
              
              But we haven't neglected the in-game adventure either. Legends has               opened up with its first server, Stormhammer, and the tales of adventure               from the folks playing there are, well, legendary; take a look at               some of their stories at the                Legends site (just click on the Tales of Adventure button).               
              
              Those of you that have been playing longer in EverQuest might remember               that we took a very in-depth look at the way melee combat worked,               and at how each of the melee classes compared to one another. We               made some changes to the basics of melee that adjusted the balance               between the classes. 
              
              We are making the same sort of adjustments to spell casters. It's               a time consuming effort, and a complicated one to implement properly.We'll               be keeping you up to date on our progress, and you on the Developer's               Corner. You can read the first update about this in the Caster               Balance Update thread.
              
              May your adventures be exciting, in-game and out. 
              
              -Alan

                      EverQuest has seen a great increase in new players since                       the release of The Shadows of Luclin. Given the sudden arrival                       of so many new adventurers into the world of Norrath, we've                       taken time to enrich the EverQuest experience at lower levels.                       At the same time, we're in the process of making a number                       of changes aimed at improving the game for players of all                       levels.                     What can you expect as a player? We are detailing the upcoming                       changes in a series of "State                       of the Game" letters, which you can read on the EverQuest                       Live site.                     Here are a few highlights from the first two letters:                    For those new to EverQuest, as well as our mid-level players:                                      <ul>                    <li>You                       are no longer                       required to stare at your spellbook while meditating.                     </li>                    <li>                       The rate at which people gain experience up to level ten                       has been accelerated.  </li>                    <li>                       Characters level nine and under will appear at their bind                       point with all of their equipment intact when they die.                        </li>                    <li>                       The commonly known "hell-levels" at 30, 35, 40, and 45 have                       been largely done away with. Further, the "post-hell-level"                       experience loss in levels 31, 36, 41, and 46 has been removed.                                                                 
                                     </ul>                                       More changes are on the way, so stay tuned to www.EverQuestlive.com                     for further details.                     <CENTER>

                                          March 16, 2002 marks the third anniversary of the launch of                       EverQuest. During these past three years, much has happened                       in the game. Three                       expansion packs have been launched with great success.                       Additional free zones and planes became available for download.                       The EverQuest Legends                       Service opened. Five Fan                       Faire events have been held throughout the country with                       many more still to come, and EverQuest's graphics engine                       received a complete overhaul in the Shadows                       of Luclin expansion.

              Welcome to the City of Shar Vahl. This city is the home of the descendants                of Vah Kerrath, King of the ascended Vah Shir tribes. King Raja                Kerrath, the grandson of King Vah Kerrath, currently rules the city.                Each citizen is expected to pay homage to King Kerrath and maintain               their obligations to both their community and chosen order.

              The process of becoming a citizen of Shar Vahl starts with the Guildmaster               of the order that you have decided to pursue. After turning in your                guild summons to the person listed on the note, you will be asked                to deliver a note to Registrar Bindarah. Her office can be found                in the building complex just across from the South Gate bridge that                leads to Shadeweaver Thicket&#133; Continue               to the step-by-step guide.
              
              
              
                          
The               Professional Orders of the Vah Shir<img src="http://www.station.sony.com/eqnl/images/Registrar-Bindarah.jpg" width="97" height="149" align="right">
              Upon becoming a citizen, each member of the community is expected                to choose a professional route. They will be required to follow                this route for the duration of their time asa citizen of Shar Vahl.                Life as a Vah Shir has been very difficult since the time of the  
              Ascension. The darkness of Luclin has caused decades of conflict.                Due to this, each profession is expected to fulfill many roles.                After completing the formal process of becoming a citizen of Shar                Vahl, a young Vah Shir can choose from five professional orders.                These orders are the Dar Khura, Khala Dun, Khati Sha, Jharin, Taruun&#133;               Learn               about the five professional orders of the Vah Shir.

                Though registration for the Dallas Fan Faire is now closed, we                  will be accepting walk-ins! However, there are a limited number                  of spaces left, so come early. The cost for walk-in registration                 is $95 to be paid at the door.
