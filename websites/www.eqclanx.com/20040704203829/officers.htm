                    guildmates, but are there to help and resolve conflicts and
                    bring betterment to the guild. An officer is also a
                    representative of
                    the guild, how they act shows how the guild acts. Their
                    actions and they themselves represent the guild as a whole.&nbsp;
                    They should have and use the
                    knowledge, judgment, and natural leadership required to be
                    an officer.&nbsp; Officers must have the courage to
                    take responsibility for not only their own actions, but for
                    the actions of the guild as a whole. This spirit of leading
                    by example breeds honor and respect within Clan X and
                    throughout Norrath.</font></font></p>

                    have more responsibility. Officers are putting their
                    reputation on the line when they guild someone, when they
                    make a decision on a problem in the guild, and pretty much

                    are required to meet once every two months to review issues
                    pertaining to the guild (this is usually done via phone
                    conference).&nbsp; The general agenda of these officer
                    meetings is based on the guild vision, the guild timeline,
                    and our respective duties as officers.&nbsp; Problems and
                    successes are also discussed at these meetings.</font></p>

                    to be readily available when there are guild issues to deal
                    with. This DOES NOT mean that it is an officer's
                    responsibility to find you a rez if you die. However,
                    officers are responsible for maintaining order in Norrath if
                    there are conflicts emerging in relation to the guild or its
                    members. Officers must know when and when not to step into
                    any given situation. In addition, officers must be able to
                    discern the difference between people who will improve and
                    be a credit to Clan X and those who will cause negative
                    controversy. They should be compassionate and firm as the
                    situation dictates.</font></p>
                    <font face="Arial" color="#B9B9FF">Part of the responsibility of an
                    officer is to be there for the guild and in Norrath
                    available to guild members in need. That means significant
                    PRESENCE IN NORRATH required to be an officer. If real life
                    issues infringe on this, officers should let the clan know
                    so that the load can be carried by others.</font>

                    within Clan X must be met before a member can become an
                    officer. The purpose of this is to ensure that the recruit
                    fits in with the guild family before they are excepted to
                    perform as an officer within the guild.</font>
