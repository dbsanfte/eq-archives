<H2> 	The City of Mist storyWhen Clan X first started going to City of Mist, we did everything wrong.  If we were lucky, we might have killed the first Black Reaver during the raid, seldom would we find a second one.  Our trains were record breaking, our CRs lasted for hours.  But the guild was relentless, and would not stop trying for the brass ring (in this case, Jade Reavers).  We didn’t know where to stand, so we fell in the water and died as the mobs pounded on us.  And let’s not forget Rixma’s favorite Blonde Blunder when she attacked Rak Ashirr and wiped out the alliance.Today, Clan X OWNS this zone.  We no longer need four groups of people to take out all 6 Black Reavers - we can do it easily with two, sometimes one.  And we can pull all 6 Black Reavers and have to wait till the next spawn cycle starts.  Not only that, so many people in Clan X could LEAD this raid - why?  Because you have gone to so many of them that you know instinctively what to do - where to stand, when to attack, when to back off, when to pull more mobs.  And after over 100 Black Reaver kills, Verrant has finally decided to reward us with Jade Reavers.City of Mist is a SUCCESS STORY for Clan X.  This is what you are all capable of.
