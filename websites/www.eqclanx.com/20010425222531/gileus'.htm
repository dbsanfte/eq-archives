        </font><p><small><font face="Verdana">&quot;Uh oh,&quot; Gileus said, &quot;this could be
        bad.&quot; He had just gotten done healing Rixma and she was at full health now. That was
        good. The rest of his party were no where to be found. That was bad. There were also three
        Pickclaw Goblins here, two warriors and a raider. That was also bad. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana"><img border="0" src="Raven%20Images/Gileus.JPG" align="right" WIDTH="246" HEIGHT="328">Gileus switched positions, trying to get a safe sitting
        place to meditate for more heals, when he found one member of his party. Lorkus, a
        hapless, none to bright warrior, was crumpled on the floor beside him, sword still gripped
        firmly in his hand. He looked like he was sleeping. If humans slept with their eyes open
        and scared, that is. He wasn&#146;t sure.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">As he tried to meditate, a warrior jumped from battering
        Rixma to beat on him a bit. As of yet, Gileus had been untouched and was feeling perfectly
        fine. He knew this was about to change. His blood would flow. He hoped not too much of it.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">He noticed that Rixma was not faring to well either. <i>Everyone
        knows that Rogues do their best work from behind</i>, though Gileus, <i>even a dumb Dwarf
        like me knows that.</i></font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">He realized there was but one choice.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">&quot;Run, Rixma. Get out, I&#146;ll be right behind
        you&quot;, he shouted.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">&quot;No way G&quot;, She said, &quot;not leaving you to
        die. Not this time.&quot;</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Gileus realized that Rixma was smiling. A wide, full
        toothed grin. Even as she was facing probable death, she was having a good time, loving
        the chaos. She was nuts. That&#146;s why he loved her so.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">&quot;Damn it Rixi, leave. Run. We can&#146;t win this one.
        Run to the guards, they will help.&quot;</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">&quot;No way Baby G, this is too much fun.&quot;</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Sighing, Gileus focused on the goblin in front of him. He
        had been doing a fair job of deflecting it&#146;s blows till now, but the ugly creature
        was getting angry, and that mean harder, more accurate hits. He gripped his mace more
        tightly and began swinging for all he was worth, hoping to knock this damn goblin to the
        Plane of Fear and back. He landed a nice blow to the side of the goblin&#146;s head, but
        the vile thing kept coming.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">He remembers the first time he had encountered a goblin. It
        was outside of his hometown of Kaladim. How long ago that seemed. Almost like a
        dream.......</font></small></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">He stood outside the large wooden door, unsure of himself,
        wondering what he would find behind it. All of this because he had asked his mother to buy
        him a new pair of boots. &quot;Gileus, my son, I think you are old enough that if you want
        something, you can buy it yourself&quot;, his mother had said. All of his pleading and
        begging got him nowhere. His mother had better things to spend their money on, and he was
        getting to old to depend on Ma and Dad for things. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">So with head hung low and a scowl on his face, he walked
        out the door of his family hut. When he professed to his Ma that he had no money, she
        suggested he get a job. When he sais he had no idea where to get a job, she said to go see
        Wumpford, he always has work. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Wumpford. What a stupid name.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Taking his Ma&#146;s directions, he headed out to see
        Wumpford. He soon found himself in a part of town he had never been in before. When he
        came to the market with his Ma or Dad, it was on the other side of town. This was
        uncharted territory and there were no parents to show him the way. He wondered if he had
        followed the directions correctly. Directions were something that Gileus did not do well,
        and he often got lost. More than once he had almost gotten totally lost going from the
        outhouse to his home during a dark night.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">He was seriously thinking about not going knocking on the
        big wooden door and going home. Who needed new boots anyway? He would just stitch the ones
        he had until something better came along. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">And he would have done just, if not for the door opening
        and a tall (tall meaning over 40 inches) graying Dwarf in front of him.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">&quot;Hello young Gileus&quot;, the old Dwarf said,
        &quot;so good to finally see you here.&quot;</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">&quot;I&#146;m here to see Wumpford.&quot; Said Gileus,
        ready to run if this old guy tried anything funny.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">&quot;And seen him you have,&quot; said the old Dwarf,
        &quot;now get inside before I close my door to you and you never see me again.&quot;</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">He said this firmly, but not without a gleam of good humor
        in his eyes. Eyes that were far younger than the rest of his face. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">After a brief look around, Gileus decided, why not, Ma
        knows where I went. If anything happened, she would come looking for him.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Gileus stepped through the doorway into Wumpford&#146;s
        cozy abode, unknowingly changing his life forever.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Gileus started out just doing basic chores for Wumpford. As
        he did this, Wumpford would train other young Dwarves in a way he had never seen before.
        They seemed to be learning some sort of magic. Watching the ice blue energy flow in small
        torrents from their hands, Gileus found himself both excited and quite interested.
        Perhaps, if he did a good enough job, Wumpford would teach him as well.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">He wasn&#146;t exactly sure what was going on there in the
        back room of Wumpfords place, but he could not seem to get enough of it. He would sit for
        hours after his job was done and watch the young Dwarves practice. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Wumpford, noticing the interest Gileus had, took him aside
        one day and spoke with him. He told him that he could train Gileus, but could not do it
        the same way he did with the other boys. The other boys&#146; training was being paid for
        by their parents, and they got exclusive treatment. If he wished to stay long after work,
        he may be able to squeeze some time in for Gileus.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Gileus eagerly accepted, promising to be Wumpfords best
        student. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Part of the deal was that Gileus would have to be a full
        time servant of Wumpford, which meant living in his home. This meant he would see less of
        his family. Not knowing exactly how to feel about this, he approached his Ma about it one
        day after coming home from Wumpfords.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">To his surprise, his Ma was all for it.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">&quot;Gileus, my eldest son, it is time for you to move
        on.&quot; His Ma said as she stirred the stew that was to be the next night&#146;s dinner.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">&quot;I feel that great things will become of you. You have
        never been the brightest, but you have certain gifts that I can&#146;t even begin to
        understand. Perhaps Wumford does. If so, perhaps he can help you pu them to best use. In
        any case, it is time for you to do what you have to. Al I as is that you never forget you
        Father and me. We both love you very much. Please come visit from time to time.&quot;</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">With that, his Ma gave him a long, strong hug and told him
        to be on his way. Since he had been spending so much time at Wumpford&#146;s anyway, most
        of his stuff was already there. All he had to do was move in officially, which he promptly
        did.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">As days turned into weeks and weeks to months, Wumpford
        discovered that Gileus was very special indeed. The young, homely Dwarf seemed to have an
        innate ability for the arcane. Specifically, magic offered from the deity Brell Serillis.
        He seemed to pick up spells such as healing and endurance with little or no effort at all.
        Amazing.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">It soon became apparent to Wumford that Gileus was the best
        student he had ever had. So good that very soon, he had taught Gileus all he could. Sadly,
        it was time to bid farewell to his best floor sweeper. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">When told that he was to leave the comfort of Wumfords,
        Gileus became scared. What was to become of him now?</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Wumpford saw the fear in his young disciple&#146;s eyes. He
        tried to calm him.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">&quot;Gileus, I have taught you all I can. There is nothing
        more for you here. I think the best thing you can do for yourself is to go to the Butcher
        Block Mountians and continue your training. For much of it you may be on your own, but
        your talents will make you very popular among other adventurers. Soon, you will be more
        powerful than you can possibly imagien, but it will not be easy. I do however, have a
        couple gifts to start you off with.&quot;</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">With that, Wumpford grabbed for something on the table
        beside him. He handed Gileus a large club, some food and water, a couple of torn scrolls,
        and a thick, leather bound book.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">&quot;Now go young Gileus and make your name. The scrolls
        are spells that will aid you. Scribe them in your spell book, and they will be with you
        forever. Use them to the best of your ability. Your time here is done. Your potential is
        great, you are no longer welcome here as anything but a guest. Fare thee well young
        adventurer.&quot;</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Barely had Gileus been able to comprehend what had happened
        when Wumpfords door was closing behind him. He had no idea what to do. He didn&#146;t even
        know how to get to Butcher Block Mountains. For all he had known, that place was just
        fairy tails his Dad used to tell him about. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">He knocked on the door to ask Wumpford for directions. No
        answer. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">He knocked again, this time harder and longer. Still no
        answer. Finally Gileus understood. He was Finally on his own.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">After asking a couple of strangers directions (one of them
        a tall person) he found his way to The Buthcher Block Mountains.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">He stood there at the entrance to his hometown and looked
        upon the landscape before him. The scenery was breathtaking to say the least. Tall
        mountains and lush greenery for as far as the eyes could see. From here he could see a
        creature. It was unlike anything he had seen before. It looked vile and nasty. He soon
        found out that he had seen his first Goblin. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Before he forgot, he sat down between the two guards and
        began to scribe his spells in the book Wumpford had given him. One was a spell called
        Minor Healing. The other, Spiritual Armor. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">He then took his first steps in to a new world and a new
        life.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">He soon found out the way of the wild. If things got too
        tough for him, he would run to the guards, and they would help him. He fought little
        chicken like creatures, skeletons, skunks, and bats and of course, he killed as many
        Goblins as possible. He learned to hate the vile things. More than once they beat him
        badly, Gileus barely surviving by running and using his magic</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Soon though, he felt he was outgoing the confines of
        Butcher Block. His learning and training seemed to be going slower and slower, although he
        had already made improvements on his fighting and spell casting skills. Unfortunately, he
        had no idea where to go next.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Occasionally he would fight with other adventurers of many
        races and skill levels, and these times he enjoyed greatly. On the whole however he hunted
        alone and practiced his spells. He got up enough money from selling looted goods to buy
        more spells, making him more formidable.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">The time came when he felt he was through with Butcher
        Block, the monsters here just too easy to kill. He was ready to go back to Wumpfords place
        and ask him when he met a huge fellow name Henelan.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Henelan was a Barbarian and looked not only strong , but
        mean. Add to the fact he was three times the size of Gileus, and Gileus was ready to run
        to the Guards. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">But Henelan was as kind as he was big. He helped Gileus by
        casting protection spells upon him, and gave him some armor. Henelan told Gileus he was a
        Shaman, which meant that he too could cast as well as fight well. After some talking,
        Henelan informed Gileus that he was considered a Cleric, because of his healing abilities.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Although they were complete opposites, They became close
        friends, Henelan often keeping an eye on Gileus while he hunted. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">One day, Henelan suggested that Gileus go to Greater
        Faydark, where he could hunt ugly Orcs, and maybe even kill Emperor Crush himself. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Gileus confessed to not knowing how to get there, and
        Henelan agreed to show him the way, as long as Gileus would follow. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Foloowing in itself was a chore for Gileus. Being so short,
        he had trouble keeping track of Henelan over hills and around trees. Also, Gileus had been
        encountering the often-present Lag Monster, a beast that rarely cause harm but could be a
        major nuisance.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Through it all, Henelan finally brought Gileus to Kelethin,
        and bound him there, so he could gate back to the city without having to run back from
        Kaladim. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">It was here that Gileus found the true joy in hunting with
        a party. First on Orc Hill then later in Crushbone, Gileus learned the ways of party
        hunting, splitting loot (more money than he had ever seen) and gaining experience at an
        incredible rate. Although the Orcs here were nasty, if you had a good group behind you,
        chances are you would live. And there were always the guards you could run to.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Gileus spent a good amount of time between Orc Hill and
        Crushbone, and in that time acquired more and more spells, better armor and weapons, and
        the knowledge that he could be an important part of any group. He was truly Enjoying his
        life. Plus, other adventurers were staring to know his name, asking him to group with
        them, wanting his healing abilities.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">The feeling of being needed was overwhelming and welcome.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Eventually however, Gileus out grew Crushbone as well. He
        soon realized that his skills were no longer challenged in the places. He needed a new
        place to hunt. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">He had kept in touch with Henelan throughout everything and
        he told Gileus he should go to Lavastorm, a hot , muggy place that would be good for his
        training. So off Gileus went, hopping a boat to Freeport and running to Lavastorm. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">This was not a particularly fun time for Gileus, as
        although he learned much, he mostly fought alone, some thing he increasingly disliked to
        do. He had become accustomed to group hunting, and he now started to think of himself as a
        helaer firts and a fighter second. Lavastorm was a lonely, dangerous place, the only
        redeeming quality being the amount of money he made. He was becoming quite the wealthy
        Cleric.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">He soon found his way to a place called Oasis, a dry place
        on the outskirts of South Ro, where there was a whole different breed of orcs. Also there
        were Spectres, and the occasional Sand Giant that would ruin anybody&#146;s day. And
        Gileus though Henelan was tall!!</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">It was in Oasis that Gileus&#146; life would take another
        major turn. It was there in Oasis that Gileus met a beautiful Wood Elf named Rixma.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Rixma seemed to just appear to him. He joined a group of
        hunters along the shores of Oasis, said his hellos, sat down and began to meditate. When
        he got up, fully prepared to begin healing, standing in front of him was a stunning Wood
        Elf. He had noticed her when he first joined, which was odd because she was the group
        leader. She had to do the inviting.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Without thinking, he began talking to her, saying anything,
        just to be close to her. Little did he realize how silly he looked with the horns on his
        helmet sticking out like some sort of strange antennae. Had he realized this, it is
        doubtful he would have cared.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Not only was Rixma beautiful, but she was pleasant as well.
        Not like many of those High Elves, who seemed to look down on him, noses in the air. And
        on top of everything, she was as deadly as she was pretty. With the use of just two
        daggers, Gileus had seen her take orc after orc to their knees with archer like precision.
        He was spellbound.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">But before he knew it, it was time to camp for the night.
        The party was breaking up. He promised to group with her again. He had to.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">He did group with her again a few more times, and Gileus
        knew he was falling in love with her. This, he told himself, was not good. Besides the
        fact that she would never go out with a Dwarf, but she was due to be married to Gress, who
        was either a Half-Elf or Wood elf himself. How could he compete with that? He himself was
        ugly and short, and he knew he had the charisma of a bad cold. It seemed he was destined
        to have his little heart broken. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Still, Rixma had taken a liking to Gileus. He seemed to
        heal her first, and always made sure she was safe and damnit if he didn&#146;t look cute
        in that horned hat. He was fun to have around too, always making her laugh when no one
        else could. He was a likeable little fellow. And a good cleric, she thought.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">They had quite a friendship going. They started grouping
        together frequently.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Then quiet unexpectedly, Gileus took off to hunt in South
        Karana. One of his friends, Tanven, had offered to take him there, but he had to leave
        now. Oasis had already grown tired to Gileus, so he decided to go with Tanven. He could
        not, however, find Rixma to tell her where he was going. As he left Oasis, he feared he
        would never see her again. He was frowning the whole trip to South Karana.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">He wasn&#146;t in South Karana for more than a day,
        fighting giant bird creatures known as Aviaks, when he heard a voice behind him.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">&quot;Hey G, funny running into you here. How&#146;s my
        favorite little Viking?&quot;</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">It was Rixma. Somehow she had found him here. What was a
        Viking? Who cared, Rixma was here that was all that mattered.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">He was so happy he lept at Rixma and gave her legs a strong
        hug. He had never been so happy.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Rixma went on to explain that she had wondered where he
        went. When she didn&#146;t see him in Oasis anymore, she decided to come to South Karana
        and hunt. The loot was good and she would learn a lot, she had been told. So here she was.
        And she happened to see him. She was very happy to see him as well.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">From that moment on, whenever you saw Gileus hunting, there
        was a good chance Rixma was with him. And vice versa. They became almost inseparable,
        looking out for each other, helping each other. Through all this, Gileus&#146; feelings
        remained strong for Rixma, but he realized they would never be more than friends. He knew
        Rixma loved him dearly, but only in friendship. He was happy with that. He vowed to
        himself to do anything to protect her, even if it meant he himself dying. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">The two of them fought many tough, good battles in South
        Karana, both against the Avaiks, and those filthy dog creatures, the SplitPaw Gnolls. They
        weren&#146;t even housetrained. Their lair was digusting.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Before too long, Gileus and Rixma found themselves fighting
        Hill Giants in the Rathe Mountains. By now, Gileus had upgraded his armor and weapon and
        Rixma became more deadly with every passing day. She also developed a strong lust for the
        battle, for chaos. She craved action and always stuck the fight out till the end. This
        particular trait meant that Gileus stuck around till the end, not wanting his love to
        perish. He had seen much bloodshed and many great fights because of this. He had also
        taken his share of bad beatings, often needing more powerful Clerics to heal both he and
        Rixma.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">It was in these Rathe Mountains that Rixma approached the
        idea of Gileus joining her guild. It really wasn&#146;t her guild, just the guild she was
        part of, but in a very real sense, it <i>was her </i>guild. The guild belonged to all of
        it&#146;s members.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">She went on to explain that a Cleric by the name of Larton
        had started the guild, called the Ancient Order of Guardians. Every Guardian had to abide
        by a certain code of ethics, and they had to carry themselves with honor and dignity.
        According to Rixma, this was the best guild in all of Norrath and she would be happy to
        have Gileus as a member.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Gileus thought about this. He didn&#146;t know if he was
        honorable or dignified, but he liked the idea about joining a guild. He agreed to try and
        get in.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Rixma brought him back to Oasis to meet with two officers
        of the guild, Another beautiful Wood Elf named Abbra , and a noble Paladin named Lonedor.
        After answering a couple questions and swearing his allegiance to the Guardians, he was
        sworn in, with a short probationary period. He was given a Rusty Dagger by Larton, leader
        of the guild. He was told when his probation was up, he would turn in the Rusty Dagger and
        get a Tarnished Dagger, the symbol of membership for the Ancient Order of Guardians. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Gileus cherished his Rusty Dagger, and when it was replaced
        with a Tarnished Dagger, he was overcome with both pride and joy.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">A strange thing began to happen to Gileus. Before he joined
        the Guardians, he was just content to wander around and live for himself, and maybe Rixma
        and hunt and kill and loot for his own personal gains. Now he seemed to have more of a
        purpose. He seemed to care greatly for his fellow Guardians. He realized that he would
        gladly lay down his life to save any one else&#146;s in the guild. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">He approached Larton about creating a Guild Fund, and was
        soon appointed Minister of Finance. He was given a Medal of Merit for his contributions to
        the Ancient Order of Guardians. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Gileus was stunned. He had never had a title before. He had
        never gotten a medal before. He realized that his fellow Guardians cared for him in the
        same way he cared for them. This truly was the best guild in all of Norrath. He loved his
        new family.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Rixma was also overjoyed at Gileus&#146; success. She was
        amazed at his assertiveness, and even as she made Officer Status in the guild, she
        continued to praise him. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">Gileus also performed the wedding services for Gress and
        Rixma. He did this with mixed emotions, as he was glad Rixma was happy, but wished he was
        in Gress&#146; spot. Some things were just not meant to be.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">So here he was, Gileus Thunderhead, a young Dwarf who once
        swept floors for copper pieces, and now he was a respected Cleric and a prominent member
        of the Ancient Order of Guardians. It seems as if Wumpfords best student has made a name
        for himself. He could hardly believe it himself.......</font></small></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">All of this flashed through the mind of Gileus as he was
        trying to smack this Pickclaw Goblin in to ground Goblin chuck steak. He was bleeding from
        a gash on his arm and a cut above his left eye was flowing pretty good. The goblin looked
        worse than he did, though, and he felt he would win this fight, but what about Rixma?</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">He glanced over at her, and she was battered, but she was
        winning. She had felled one of her foes and she had the other on the run, perfect for a
        Rogue. Soon that one would be dead too. </font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">After the final goblin lay dying in a growing pool of
        it&#146;s own blood, Rixma came and sat facing Gileus and smiled. He smiled back.</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">&quot;Let me med up crazy lady and we&#146;ll get our party
        back together, and we&#146;ll do this all over again.&quot;</font></small></p>
        <p><small><font face="Verdana">&quot;Of course Baby G,&quot; she said, grinning
