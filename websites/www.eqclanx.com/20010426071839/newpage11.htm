        -&nbsp;A Life of Hiding</em></font><font SIZE="2" FACE="VERDANA,ARIAL"></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All she knew was darkness, secrecy, lightlessness. The day was to be
        feared, watched closely, never trusted. Pain existed in the sunlight where eyes followed
        her constantly - her only safety existed in obscurity. </p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><img border="0" src="Raven%20Images/myrixxy.jpg" width="187" height="278" align="left" hspace="7" vspace="3">She had been told the story only once, but it had haunted her, kept her
        hidden in the shadows. The story of her father Ailwon and her mother Liana. </p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was never a more possessive or sinister man than Gylurec. Under
        false pretenses as a teacher, Gylurec had taken Ailwon under his wing, but his intentions
        were far more malicious. At the first sight of Liana, the wizard had snapped into an
        unquenchable obsession. Liana immediately sensed his wickedness, but Ailwon would not hear
        her cries for help, insisting that she was a silly woman and knew nothing of magic or it's
        masters. Gylurec would pretend to teach Ailwon the art of magic by day, secretly observing
        Liana&#146;s every move, watching her sleep next to her husband by night, always so close
        to her. Liana told her husband that she could feel Gylurec&#146;s treacherous hands
        crawling on her skin every night as she slept. Ailwon refused to listen to her fears.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The day came when Ailwon approached Gylurec with exciting news.
        &quot;Master, oh master! I am to become a father. My fair Liana is with child. Oh my Lord,
        I promise to teach my child all the wonders that you have shown &#133;&quot; </p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ailwon could barely speak as he saw the transformation before his eyes.
        Gylurec's calm demeanor became a contortion of unspeakable rage. &quot;Liana will NEVER
        bear another man&#146;s child!&quot; The shriek of Gylurec crowed like some malevolent
        rooster heralding the dawn of hell, and Ailwon&#146;s pulse trembled at the sound. The
        wizard&#146;s soothing brown eyes changed instantly to an icy blue, driving a lifeless
        stare into Ailwon's heart. A tranquil face metamorphosed into fiery orange madness, a
        grimace of frenzy revealed openly for Ailwon's soul. As a shriek of insanity wailed from
        the wizard's being, Ailwon was already running from his master - running as far from
        Gylurec as possible. He could hear Gylurec's home bursting into flame as the wizard's
        shriek grew to madness, Ailwon scrambling to safety faster than he ever thought possible.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ailwon fled with his pregnant wife for fear that the couple and their
        unborn child would be killed instantly by Gylurec's wrath. In the dankness of the forest
        and within the shadows of the mountains, Ailwon and Liana lurked about, hiding for months
        from the madness of Gylurec&#146;s jealousy until their beloved daughter Rixma was born to
        them. For a time, they celebrated their newfound happiness, but Ailwon continued to keep a
        watchful eye on his surroundings, never allowing his guard to falter. But as Rixma neared
        the age of 12, the monster caught up with them. The story was like ice in her veins,
        chilling her to the bone every time she recalled it.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rixma remembered the day of her mother's death - she could not escape
        the images that possessed her mind. It happened in an instant - a moment of brilliant
        light when the wizard appeared before them. A terrified look on her parent's face as they
        saw the mage dissolve into view. Gylurec raised a palm in front of them and with a simple
        motion of clenching his fist, Liana collapsed dead in front of her husband and daughter.
        Before Ailwon could even scream in grief over the loss of his wife, the mage encased him
        in a spiral of ardent light, Ailwon unable to make a sound. Rixma stared at the pair,
        unable to keep her eyes off of them. Gylurec spoke to Ailwon, spitting his vehemence at
        the helpless man.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;You have no comprehension of the wrath I shall bring down upon
        your head, feeble elf. You shall suffer as Liana suffered. But your physical pain is
        futile in contrast to the mental anguish you will feel at what I will do to Rixma. I will
        strike my vengeance upon her soul, and you will watch every agonizing moment I touch her.
        She will know pain like no other. Before taking her life with my own hands, I will take
        her to my bed, plant my seed. She will be my prisoner and my lover as my child grows
        within her. Know, feeble elf, that your grandchild will never know its mother - Rixma will
        die the instant of her motherhood. Think on this and be dismayed.&quot;</p>
        <p ALIGN="center"><img border="0" src="Raven%20Images/RixxygoBOOM.jpg" width="322" height="376"> </p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With a grimace, Gylurec turned a lifeless gaze at Rixma and whispered
        softly, &quot;Your pain and my pleasure shall be so sweet little one. Prepare for my
        return.&quot; </p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rixma watched as her father and his captor disappeared in a flurry of
        brilliant light, a look of helplessness on her father's face. Although she could not hear
        his voice, she managed to understand four words that he tried to tell her. Reading his
        lips &#133; &quot;Watch, ward, listen, silence.&quot;</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Watch &#133; ward &#133; listen &#133; silence. Watch &#133; ward
        &#133; listen &#133; silence. It had become a sort of mantra for her. She kept to the
        shadows, and said those words every hour on the hour. The only thing she knew in life was
        to hide, to avoid the sunlight, to live in constant fear of the inevitable doom awaiting
        her. She lived for years this way &#133; until she met Gress.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She had learned to use her skills in battle to help rid the countryside
        of thugs and evil creatures. Almost always, she worked alone. However, travelling through
        the Commonlands one evening, she came across a group of people fighting orcs, and she
        joined in the fight. One of those people was a druid named Gress. He could hardly keep his
        eyes off of her. He was so distracted by her in fact that an orc almost took his head off
        - the only thing that saved him was the quick reflexes of Rixma's backstab and a dagger in
        just the right spot of the orc's broad neck. It fell at Gress' feet, but his staring eyes
        held only Rixma's face. In disbelief, she shook her head at the wood elf and smiled
        &quot;You should be more careful - no one wants to group with a dead druid. &quot; </p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gress awakened from his trance to find that Rixma was already dashing
        away from him. &quot;Wait,&quot; he called out. Rixma turned to face the druid who was
        walking slowly toward her. &quot;I mean, I just want to talk to you,&quot; he said, still
        gazing into her face. &quot;Thanks for your help back there.&quot;</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Anytime,&quot; she responded. &quot;But you really should pay
        attention to what you are doing. You may get a lot of people angry with you if you lose
        your focus again.&quot;</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;But if you are around to save me all the time, I really don't
        need to worry about it, do I,&quot; Gress responded with a grin. &quot;Hey, want to marry
        me?&quot;</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;What!&quot; she laughed, shocked at his forwardness. &quot;Who do
        you think you are? I don't even know you.&quot;</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Well, get to know me then,&quot; he responded with a smile. </p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rixma ended up spending time with Gress, more time than she ever
        dreamed she would spend with anyone. They fought together in the Commonlands, North Ro,
        and Oasis, ridding the land of foul creatures. They also spoke about their lives, and
        Rixma told Gress about her parents and Gylurec.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;You know, Rixi,&quot; he said one day. &quot;You don't have to be
        alone anymore. Join my family, my guild. They will protect you from this monster. The
        Ancient Order of Guardians is filled with the finest people in all of Norrath - they would
        all lay down their lives in defense of yours. You have what it takes within you to be a
        Guardian. Constantly helping others in need and upholding the truth. If you follow the
        code, support the mission of the AoG, they will defend you till the end.&quot;</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gress introduced Rixma to Larton and the rest of her AoG family. From
        the first day of her Guardianship, Rixma felt safer, more complete. They have continually
        saved her on countless occasions, and for months she felt that she had been delivered
        finally from the clutches of the vile Gylurec. It was not until after the wedding to her
        beloved Gressie that she felt the hands of that monster reaching out for her.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mere days after her wedding she noticed the change in her husband.
        Gress had devoted his life and his love to her, but was engaged in altercations with
        members of the guild, especially with the leader Larton. Unnatural forces of nature seemed
        to take over the arguments, resulting in the dismissal of Gress from her new family. She
        could hardly believe it - this wasn't her Gressie. Had Gylurec decided to inflict his
        outrage on her now? What better way to cause her misery than to impose his power on her
        beloved husband? She could feel the force of his hand in this, altering her husband's
        state of mind, creating contention within the guild that never existed before. Would he
        attempt to break up her clan before he utterly destroyed her? How many people would
        Gylurec hurt in his vengeance against her? <i>How could she have been so careless to bring
        this danger to the Ancient Order of Guardians? </i></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She was bound and determined to reverse the course set by Gylurec. He
        would not have control over her or any of her family. She refused to allow it - he would
        never dominate her - she would command her own destiny &#133;</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font FACE="VERDANA,ARIAL" size="3" color="#D6B810"><em>Chapter
        Two - Rixma's Adversary</em></font></p>
          <font SIZE="2" FACE="VERDANA,ARIAL">
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gylurec steamed in a thick emerald vapor flowing from the bottles and
        cruets strewn across his dwelling. The scowl on his face paled in comparison to the
        cerulean gaze he held fixed on the wall across a cluttered table of vials and books. His
        palms lay flat on the table, gripping the decomposing wood more for control of his temper
        than for balance. Bah! Control is for weaklings, he trembled, knocking over flasks and
        papers as he shook the table violently, his gaze still focused on the same abomination on
        the wall before him. He had placed the weapon there to feed his animosity, to keep his
        blood boiling, to be a constant reminder of the only obstacle between himself and
        universal justification. </p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ailwon and his wretched offspring, he fumed! He had been forced to wait
        years to exercise his vengeance upon the elf &#150; his plan was so deliciously blood
        thirsty, he wouldn&#146;t sacrifice his vision of the destruction of this man and his
        family for anything, even if it meant waiting another lifetime. Yet, his patience was
        wearing intolerably thin.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He had almost captured that vile creature Rixma years ago when she
        briefly came out of hiding to fight alongside that coward druid Gress. But Gress had
        recruited her into a clan of unspeakable power and Gylurec was totally unable to touch
        her. He seethed at the recollection of his impotency to finish her off. Her whole life,
        Rixma seemed to have been just out of his reach, unnaturally protected. Even total
        strangers like Herradon had paid for Rixma&#146;s safety with their lives. Hellfire he
        hated that elf! Gylurec picked up a flask of a foul smelling viscous solution and slammed
        the glass on the table in front of him &#150; flames and a malignant stench erupted as the
        chalice burst into shards of fire and light. Damn it to hell he LOATHED that creature!</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gylurec&#146;s anger was amplified by his current frustration of the
        new power he now had to confront. The Ancient Order of Guardians had strength at their
        core that he couldn&#146;t grip. Grip hell! He couldn&#146;t even come physically close to
        their newest member. What the hell was it that held them together? He had been forced to
        take a strategic alternative &#150; at that recollection, however, Gylurec allowed an evil
        smile to spread across his face.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gylurec had already executed a plan to rid the land of Rixma and her
        father Ailwon (the old elf had been reduced to a shell of a living soul, but his daughter
        still had a nightmare to live through). Rixma&#146;s membership into the Ancient Order of
        Guardians actually provided more sweet revenge than anything he could have imagined on his
        own. She had bonded with these people, become friends with them, loved them. Gylurec
        licked his lips as if tasting a sweet dessert, dreaming of the satisfaction he would feel
        when Rixma lost everyone she cared about. Only then would he take her life. He savored the
        vision, relished in it. From a distance, Gylurec had been able to cause struggle and
        rebellion within the Ancient Order of Guardians, resulting in the removal of Rixma&#146;s
        pathetic husband from the clan. Her pain at that loss had given Gylurec a reason to
        snicker in triumph, to taste victory. There would be much more misery to come, dear,
        precious elf. You will NEVER escape my wrath.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gylurec continued to stare at the tarnished dagger on the wall before
        him and lifted his palms outward to face it where it hung. His hands began to glow an icy
        blue illuminesence, unmistakably matching the frigid stare of his eyes. As the grin on his
        face widened into a merciless grimace, a resounding crack filled the room, as if the
        sounds of lightening had been captured within his palms giving him the mastery to unleash
        it at his will. Gylurec watched as his power slowly grew, his palms encased in white-hot
        fire. He was in control now &#150; they don&#146;t realize how out of control and lost the
        Ancient Order of Guardians would become at his determination, how much they would be made
        to suffer due to their allegiance with Rixma. And when he had brought them all sniveling
        to their knees &#150; every guardian, every officer, that damned Lonedor and the acts of
        his father, even their treacherous and ineffective leaders Larton, Sensy, and Abbra,
        &#150; only then would he take Rixma from their helpless visage. With that malicious
        thought, Gylurec released his white fire, focussing it at the cross section of the blade
        in front of him. The tarnished dagger shattered instantly in shards of steel, scattering
        everywhere in the mage&#146;s abode.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I will dispel the lot of you to all corners of Norrath, weakling
        guild,&quot; Gylurec seethed. He gripped sharp pieces of the broken weapon that had landed
        near him, allowing the edges to cut his fiery palms and fingers, blood beginning to flow
        freely onto the oaken table. &quot;You will never preserve her &#150; I will destroy all
        of you in your feeble defenses of Rixma &#150; SHE IS MINE!&quot;</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rixma held her head
          in her hands as she sat beneath the towering palm tree, unable to
          move, staring at the lifeless sands near her feet. This had been a
          place for Guardians. Not only did her friends meet here for
          discussions about strategies, but this had also been a place for so
          much fun. Gileus entertained the Guardians here with jokes about gnome
          tossing and bragging that he had some rogue wench at home polishing
          his armor. Everyone knew Gileus was a little cocky, but it was part of
          his charm, and part of the character that eventually became the
          embodiment of every Guardian. Rixma tried to smile at the recollection
          of Guardians at play, Guardians at work, Guardians in celebration of
          their prosperity in Norrath, but a single tear falling from her cheek
          to the white sands below was all she could manage.</font></p>
          <font FACE="ZapfHumnst BT"></font>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Verdana">How had he done it?
          The destruction of the Guardians had left her paralyzed, unable to
          comprehend what evil could have brought her family to this. No. She
          knew the evil all too well. An evil that had a face and voice but was
          invisible to her and out of her reach. But how had he managed to tear
          them apart? They had become so powerful &#150; a unit of force and
          charisma that had shown Norrath what it meant to be a champion, a
          protector &#150; a true Guardian of the land. And somehow, that evil
          creature had infested her life once again. Her fingers clenched,
          digging into her scalp and neck as she wrestled with the helpless rage
          inside of her.</font></p>
          <font FACE="ZapfHumnst BT"></font>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rixma lifted her head
          to the clear blue horizon staring back at her near the tunnel of North
          Ro. She could see forever here. But that future was so undecided now
          &#150; was it a path to victory, or eternal damnation?</font></p>
          <font FACE="ZapfHumnst BT"></font>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Gylurec had not
          achieved a total victory, but he had definitely caused irreversible
          damage. A wedge had been driven into the very heart of the Guardians,
          and only a shell of the guild remained, their future walking a fine
          line of survival and death. She shook her head at the horizon
          realizing that she not only participated in leaving the guild, but
          also was a major participant in the explosion that caused the
          suffering. The Guardians who left had managed to pick up the pieces
          and find solace in each other, but this was the only thing saving them
          from total annihilation. How would they continue from here?</font></p>
          <font FACE="ZapfHumnst BT"></font>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rixma continued to
          stare out at the calm waters and realized she was sitting under the
          tree where she and Gress were married. More contradictions in a single
          memory &#150; pleasure and pain tied up as one &#150; both always present
          both consuming her soul. Soon the feelings would become
          indistinguishable. She could feel her heart solidifying in protection
          from her foe &#150; no more love, no more hate &#150; only the determination
          to rid her life of the only thing she knew to be true. Her survival
          depended on Gylurec&#146;s extinction from Norrath.</font></p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;How wrong you
          are, weakling female,&quot; a slithering voice whispered in her ear.
          The Wood Elf jumped up and turned around to face an asp who had been
          winding down the tree toward her, Eyerazzia and Locustlure blades
          instantly in her grasp and ready for any blood she could find.
          &quot;Oh do not harm me gentle yet inferior lady, for you would do
          wise to heed my words.&quot; The snake dropped to the hot sand at the
          base of the tree and stopped, staring at her with venomous eyes.</font></p>
          <font FACE="ZapfHumnst BT"></font>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;And you could
          not possibly be more foolish than to attempt surprising a furious

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Females!&quot;
          the snake snapped. &quot;I shall never understand why anyone of
          intelligence could find you useful in battle. But to put you in a
          position of authority in defeating a horror like Gylurec is the most
          absurd idea ever born! Bah! I can see it now. Whining because you
          broke your dagger. Always at the back of the battle formation because
          your tiny little legs just can&#146;t move fast enough to get to the
          front line. And what would you do if you got to the front line anyway?
          Burst out into tears because the bloodshed at the scene of carnage has
          ruined your favorite tunic! Stupid useless female waste of my

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rixma could not help but grin at the
          snake. She was unsure if her still defensive stance and the grip on
          her weapons were due to an uncertainty of the power of the creature in
          front of her, or total bewilderment at the idiocy of the reptile. She
          relished in the thought that this would most likely be the easiest
          kill she ever made, taking out the asp with two simultaneous swings of
          her slender arms, slicing it into pieces before it had the chance to
          slither its indignity at her again. Yet, the snake had mentioned her
          adversary. &quot;What do you know of Gylurec?&quot;</font></p>
