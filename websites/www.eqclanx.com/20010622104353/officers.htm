                    actions and they themselves represent the guild as a whole.&nbsp;
                    <font color="#ffcf85">They should have and use the
                    knowledge, judgment, and natural leadership required to be
                    an officer.&nbsp; </font>Officers must have the courage to
                    take responsibility for not only their own actions, but for
                    the actions of the guild as a whole. This spirit of leading
                    by example breeds honor and respect within Clan X and
                    throughout Norrath.</font></font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="ZapfHumnst BT,sans-serif" size="2">When we
                    started Clan X, the one thing we wanted to keep true is that
                    officers were no better or wielded no more pull in the guild
                    than a non-officer. I believe that this still holds true,
                    and it will continue to be this way. Every single person in
                    this guild has the exact same power. There is no elitism.
                    There is no officers first mentality.&nbsp;&nbsp; Officers
                    have more responsibility. Officers are putting their
                    reputation on the line when they guild someone, when they
                    make a decision on a problem in the guild, and pretty much
                    every time they interact with other players.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font color="#ffcf85" face="ZapfHumnst BT,sans-serif" size="2">Officers
                    are required to meet once per month to review issues
                    pertaining to the guild (this can be via game, chat room, or
                    e-mail).&nbsp; These reviews will handle any requests,
                    recommendations, and anything else concerning officer status
                    ... Monthly reviews are intended to give members the feeling
                    that officer nominations and requests are still in the
                    works.&nbsp; It also allows us to monitor the ratio of
                    officers to members on a regular basis and at this time we
                    can handle any additional officer business needed.&nbsp; It
                    also will allow us to review individuals actions compared to
                    the charter to see if they are officer material.</font></p>
                    <font size="2">
                    <p><font face="ZapfHumnst BT,sans-serif">A member's primary
                    responsibility as an officer is to guild new recruits, be
                    responsible for that new recruit for 30 days, and to inform
                    the recruit of Clan X contact information (e-mail, website,
                    officer names, etc.). We really need to ensure that we guild
                    members worthy of our Clan. It isn't about numbers - it is
                    about quality.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="ZapfHumnst BT,sans-serif">An officer must be there
                    during game time to answer questions of Clan X members and
                    to be readily available when there are guild issues to deal
                    with. This DOES NOT mean that it is an officer's
                    responsibility to find you a rez if you die. However,
                    officers are responsible for maintaining order in Norrath if
                    there are conflicts emerging in relation to the guild or its
                    members. Officers must know when and when not to step into
                    any given situation. In addition, officers must be able to
                    discern the difference between people who will improve and
                    be a credit to Clan X and those who will cause negative
                    controversy. They should be compassionate and firm as the
                    situation dictates.</font></p>
                    <font face="ZapfHumnst BT,sans-serif">Part of the responsibility of an
                    officer is to be there for the guild and in Norrath
                    available to guild members in need. That means significant
                    PRESENCE IN NORRATH required to be an officer. If real life
                    issues infringe on this, officers should let the clan know
                    so that the load can be carried by others.</font>

                    within Clan X must be met before a member can become an

                    fits in with the guild family before they are excepted to
                    perform as an officer within the guild.</font>

                        guild will decide if we need more officers, and will
                        vote on who in that list is ready for the responsibility
                        of officership.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

                        abilities to perform this very important role.&nbsp; The
                        Action Plan for each member is created to ensure that
                        each officer upholds the goals and integrity of Clan X,
                        and is designed to help that member become the best
