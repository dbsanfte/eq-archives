        <p ALIGN="left"></b><font face="Verdana" color="#D6B810"><em>Chapter 1 &#150; Lonedor is
        named</em></font></p>
    </center>
</center>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">Here begins the tale of Lonedor. Lonedor lived in a world
        known as Norrath. Norrath is a world with several known continents peopled by a multitude
        of races including Barbarians, several different races of Elves, Erudites, Gnomes,
        Halflings, Humans, Ogres, Trolls, Dwarves and Lizardmen. For the most part, these races
        stay among themselves in their own areas of Norrath. However there were also many brave
        adventurers from all races that can be found through out Norrath.</font></small></p>
        <p align="center"><small><font face="Verdana"><img border="0" src="Raven%20Images/Lonedor1.jpg" WIDTH="304" HEIGHT="419"></font></small></p>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">Lonedor was raised on the continent of Antonica in a small
        coastal town called Freeport. Freeport is located midway between the north and south ends
        of Antonica on the Eastern seaboard. To the south of Freeport lays the Desert of Ro. The
        Desert of Ro is a dry and dangerous place. The further south one goes the more dangerous
        and inhospitable the area becomes. Populations dwindle and monsters run rampant in the
        southern most reaches of Ro. The Desert of Ro has many pinnacles, spires, and obelisks
        poking through the sands of Ro. Learned scholars believed that there is an ancient massive
        civilization buried beneath the desert. The ancient civilization seemed to have been a
        Mecca for powerful magic users. There was a platform in the northern part of the desert of
        Ro that was imbued with a sense of magical power. Wizards and other magic- users still
        continued to use it as a teleportation site. These spires and obelisks were all over
        Antonica. Even in the Commonlands. Here was a tunnel to some catacombs known as Befallen.
        Befallen seems to add credence to the scholars theory that there is an ancient city buried
        under the desert. The magical energy in Befallen is enormous and necromancers and undead
        roam the corridors and halls of this ancient underground ruined city. It is filled with
        the stench of stale moldy air and death and decay. Many of the monsters are diseased by
        rabies and other nasty plagues.</font></small></p>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">To the west of Freeport are the Commonlands, which is a
        grassy savanna teaming with natural and unnatural wildlife. There are bears, lions,
        wolves, griffins and the undead. To the north of Freeport is the Nektulos Forest. This is
        a region that Lonedor has not ventured to yet.</font></small></p>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">Freeport is mostly a human city with most of the normal
        attractions found in cities of its size. There are merchants, shops, a theatre, an arena
        and a city guard. Most guilds are represented in Freeport. They range from Paladins,
        Clerics, Warriors and Magic-users. There are forges, bakeries and breweries. And of
        course, there are docks since Freeport is a coastal city.</font></small></p>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">Lonedor did not know anything about where he was born or
        who his parents were. He was left alone at the door of the paladins as an infant. The
        paladins took him in and raised him as their own. Since they didn&#146;t know anything
        about this infant left on their doorstep they called him Lonedor because he was left a
        &quot;lone&quot; at the &quot;door&quot;, hence, Lonedor. It is a little known fact that
        paladins do have a very good since of humor, although maybe not the wittiest, as shown by
        the naming of their new ward. </font></small></p>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">Lonedor was normal human baby. The only distinguishing
        feature about him was a mysterious mark on his left breast slightly above his heart. The
        paladins could not tell if it was a tattoo, a birthmark, or something less mundane. Upon
        occasion the paladins would swear the mark glowed slightly iridescent. </font></small></p>
        <b><p ALIGN="left"></b><font face="Verdana" color="#D6B810"><em>Chapter 2 - Life as a
        Squire</em></font></p>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">Lonedor spent his youth becoming very familiar with
        physical labor while serving as a squire to Sir Theo. As a young boy, Lonedor was a squire
        to Sir Theo. Lonedor received much of his training from Sir Theo and continues to practice
        with him upon his returns to Freeport. Lonedor was not the best pupil Sir Theo had.
        Lonedor was left-handed by nature and so he had to work hard to overcome this flaw because
        there is no such thing as a left-handed swordsman. Although many warriors fight with a
        weapon in each hand the paladins did not see this as a noble and chivalrous way to fight.
        A true noble warrior should give his opponent at least an equal opportunity to be able to
        win in battle because the virtuous warrior would win because he was fighting the noble
        fight and his god would protect him. </font></small></p>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana"><img border="0" src="Raven%20Images/Lone.JPG" align="right" hspace="5" WIDTH="268" HEIGHT="388">Lonedor began practicing his fighting skills just outside
        the West gate of Freeport. Lonedor was given a rusty one-handed sword from Sir Theo to
        begin his training. Lonedor practiced his skills by killing rats, bats and snakes. Upon
        occasion a Deathfist Pawn would catch Lonedor straying too far from the West gate and give
        Lonedor a real beating. Fortunately for Lonedor, the ever-vigilant guards were still close
        enough to save Lonedor&#146;s life on several occasions. Lonedor still has many of the
        scars from his encounters with the Deathfist Pawns. It was these encounters that made
        Lonedor want to be more than a warrior. He wanted to be able to help all his friends and
        even people he didn&#146;t know by being able to do more than swing a sword. So as Lonedor
        grew he trained with the Clerics at the Temple of Marr in the ways of healing.</font></small></p>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">Lonedor remembers the warm summer days and the smell of the
        sea mixed with that of the war-horses as he cleaned their stalls, rubbed them down and
        brushed their manes and tails. The war-horses were large powerful animals that the
        paladins adorned in armor similar to their own plate mail. The paladins used the
        war-horses in their pursuit to cleanse Norrath of all evil. The war-horses were invaluable
        in battling larger creatures such as griffins and giants. The war-horses were more than
        weapons to be wielded by the paladins; they were partners with their riders. Each horse
        and rider functioned as one powerful massive weapon.</font></small></p>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">Along with Lonedor&#146;s duties of tending to the
        war-horses he also polished the armor and did some minor sewing to mend leather armor and
        backpacks. These sewing skills were something he continued to practice so he could be
        self-sufficient while traveling. </font></small></p>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">During the winters at Freeport when travel was limited due
        to snow and other bad weather, Lonedor worked at one of the local forges in the Northern
        part of the city under the tutelage of a master dwarven smith. While working the forge and
        swing the hammer, Lonedor began to develop a very strong and hard body. </font></small></p>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana"><img border="0" src="Raven%20Images/LoneAlex.JPG" align="left" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="292">Another aspect of Lonedor&#146;s training and education was
        handled by the clerics at the Temple of Marr. The clerics were wise masters at the art of
        healing and lived by a code of helping all that were in need. Many of the paladins and
        clerics were followers of Mithaniel Marr. Followers of Mithaniel Marr believe that valor
        is what separates civilized beings from beasts. His followers live by a strict moral code
        that prizes truth, honor, and charity. They are champions of the downtrodden and the most
        noble of warriors. His followers strive to rid Norrath of all things dark and evil, often
        sacrificing themselves in this never-ending crusade. They will not rest until the day when
        all of Norrath is cleansed in Mithaniel&#146;s light. They take themselves and their duty
        very seriously, and have little patience for mischief and mayhem. Many citizens of Norrath
        have said that paladins have a &quot;holier than thou&quot; attitude which is not true. As
        mentioned earlier they have a wonderful sense of humor but they also take their duty to
        the citizens for Norrath extremely serious.</font></small></p>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">The clerics were also very well read and had amassed an
        amazing amount of knowledge in all areas including economics, politics, geography,
        mathematics, science and magic. The brotherhood of clerics at the Temple of Marr taught
        Lonedor much, an instilled in him the virtue and honor of helping others. Unfortunately
        for Lonedor, the brotherhood of clerics at the Temple of Marr had also taken vows of
        celibacy and they taught Lonedor about the sins of carnal pleasure. The paladins however
        took no such vows and many had wives. There were some paladins that were so into their
        crusade that they did not have the time for such diversions. Due to this mixed education
        in philosophy, Lonedor continues to struggle mentally and emotionally with the virtues of
        sexual pleasure. Physically Lonedor has never partaken in the delights of knowing a woman
        but in his own mind he was a master at pleasuring women. Lonedor found all women beautiful
        and fascinating. Unfortunately every time he met a woman his mind would stray to their
        physical beauty accompanied by some kind of sexual fantasy. Due to his training as a
        swordsman and the duty to his code he would never let his mind stray when he was actually
        engaged in a battle.</font></small></p>
        <b><p ALIGN="left"></b><font face="Verdana" color="#D6B810"><em>Chapter 3 &#150; Lonedor
        meets friends</em></font></p>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">Lonedor was a shy, quiet lad while growing up. Most of the
        time he practiced his skills by himself and didn&#146;t have time to practice with the
        other children due to his duties as a squire. However as Lonedor got stronger in both the
        healing arts and swordsmanship he began to venture further from Freeport and traveled into
        the northern area of the Desert of Ro. There his skills have been truly tested. Lonedor
        started to rely on others and group with other noble people who had a desire to eradicate
        evil from the land. Lonedor began to seek out alliances with people of different races and
        skills. There were magic-users, bards, druids, drawves, elves, Halflings, rogues and
        shamans. Most of the people were also adventurers honing their skills and wiping out evil
        where they found it.</font></small></p>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">Lonedor was in the desert one day, not to far from a local
        inn, walking near some palm trees, when he happened upon a lovely young female High-elf.
        Young is a relative term when describing elves. No matter how old elves are when measured
        by years they still maintain a youthful appearance. This particular elf had long flaxen
        hair and was dressed in a flowing sea-green robe made out of the most delicate and wispy
        silk fabric that clung deliciously to the shape of her body, at least as seen by Lonedor.
        In her hand she carried a delicately carved ornate oaken staff. Lonedor was well aware
        that the staff was much more than a decorated walking stick. It could be wielded as a
        lethal weapon. Lonedor had seen others of her class slay extremely dangerous beasts with
        similar staffs. Lonedor came to learn this lovely elf&#146;s name was Marissa. During that
        day Lonedor helped Marissa hone her skills, as a magic- user on some of the minor beasts
        of the desert, by acting as her guardian in case her spells failed or the beasts became
        more that she could handle. As Lonedor visited with Marissa he learned she was a member of
        a guild. They talked briefly about the guild, but it was not until later when one of
        Marissa&#146;s friends came along that Lonedor learned much more about guilds and
        Marissa&#146;s guild in particular. Marissa&#146;s friend was a powerful Barbarian Shaman
        named Elgor. Elgor was an officer in the guild. Lonedor learned from Elgor that the guild
        was called &quot;The Ancient Order of Guardians.&quot; Elgor explained the purpose of the
        guild and the Code of Ethics the members lived by. Their mission was to protect and serve
        the citizens of Norrath by showing courage, charity and educating anyone in need. Lonedor
        himself had spent many days helping people just like Marissa and was already living by
        that code.</font></small></p>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">Lonedor was very impressed by this mission and was of a
        like mind to the two members he had met so far. Elgor invited Lonedor to join the guild
        and Lonedor gladly accepted the offer. Lonedor was soon promoted to officer status within
        the Ancient Order of Guardians, only Mithaniel Marr knows why, but he saw it as a great
        honor and accepted the position. As a badge of being a member within the guild, Elgor gave
        Lonedor a tarnished dagger and told him that it would act as his compass. It was not a
        compass in the physical sense where it would point North, but it was a compass to remind
        Lonedor of the proper path to follow on his spiritual journey in helping others.</font></small></p>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">Lonedor is very non-political by nature and is sometimes
        oblivious to most issues that are not part of the code he is living. However as in any
        loving family there can still be disputes that arise and so there was within the Ancient
        Order of Guardians. But in this particular instance there seemed to be something sinister
        that was acting upon one of the guildmembers. Lonedor had no idea of what kind of force
        could make a person act that way but Lonedor knew very little in the ways of enchantment. </font></small></p>
        <b><p ALIGN="left"></b><font face="Verdana" color="#D6B810"><em>Chapter 4 &#150; Lonedor
        thinks of women</em></font></p>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">At one of the guild meetings in the Northern Desert of Ro
        by the Ocean, Lonedor was introduced to a human female Paladin. Human female paladins are
        fairly rare and Lonedor found that to be exotic. Lonedor felt a special bond with all
        Paladins; especially human Paladins from his hometown. Her name was Scarlitt and she was a
        long legged dark haired beauty. Her long dark hair reminded him of the pleasure he got
        from brushing the tails and manes of the warhorses. She was adorned chain mail and wielded
        a long, powerful 2 handed sword. Scarlitt had a powerful athletic build and yet very
        shapely female&#146;s body. Female warriors and paladins looked stunning in their finely
        crafted chain mail and breastplates. The dwarven smiths were superb artisans. They crafted
        the breastplates with a hint of nipples and the full, well-cupped breasts, tapered ribcage
        and washboard stomach. Lonedor was well versed in the buckles and trapping of paladin
        armor and knew he could have it all off of Scarlitt in less than 2 minutes if she was
        willing. Lonedor was torn between his chivalrous nature as a gentleman and his male desire
        when he looked upon Scarlitt. On the one hand he wanted to be the prefect gentleman and on
        the other hand his male desire wanted to take her like the barbarians or lizardmen would
        or even like the druids in their wolf-form. Lonedor had to mentally laugh at himself as
        his mind came back from his fantasy about Scarlitt. Here he was a fine righteous
        upstanding paladin having sexual fantasies about a fellow adventurer and guildmember. But
        as long as he was thinking about physical pleasure, he could also mentally picture the
        shapely druids in their leather tunics, or magic-users in their fine, lightweight silk
        robes, or even the huge, rotund framed ogre women could be strangely appealing. As Lonedor
        got to know Scarlitt he learned she was a very flirtatious and gregarious young woman.
        Lonedor, being a true gentleman, often wondered if she got the name, Scarlitt, because
        that is the color she made the young men&#146;s checks turn with her flirting. Scarlitt
        would later become one of Lonedor&#146;s favorite hunting partners.</font></small></p>
        <b><p ALIGN="left"></b><font face="Verdana" color="#D6B810"><em>Chapter 5 &#150; Lonedor
        receives help</em></font></p>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">As Lonedor ponders his early years, there is one figure
        that stands out more so than anyone else that has aided him as he was growing. The figure
        is that of a diminutive dwarf cleric named Guldarn. Guldarn was always nearby when Lonedor
        needed anything. He gave Lonedor platinum pieces, better armor, better weapons, guidance,
        advice and magically fortified him every time they met. There seemed to be a bond between
        Guldarn and Lonedor but Lonedor did not know why.</font></small></p>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">Lonedor also received many gifts from very skilled paladins
        he only met in passing. As these paladins upgraded their own armor and weapons they would
        pass their extra equipment down to other struggling paladins.</font></small></p>
        <b><p ALIGN="left"></b><font face="Verdana" color="#D6B810"><em>Chapter 6 &#150; Lonedor
        picks a surname and learns of his parents</em></font><b></p>
        </b><p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">As is the custom among many of the citizens of Norrath,
        when a person comes of age in experience and skill, they select their own surname. The
        time was quickly approaching for Lonedor to select his surname. As it so happens, Guldarn
        shows up unexpectedly and informs Lonedor that he has something he must tell him about his
        parents now that he is of age. </font></small></p>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">Guldarn explained that he knew Lonedor&#146;s mother and
        father and that Lonedor&#146;s mother&#146;s name was Adora and his father&#146;s name was
        Herradon. Adora and Herradon were also followers of Mithaniel Marr. While doing the will
        of Mithaniel Marr, Adora came upon a group of noble warriors being badly beaten by some
        vile evil forces of Norrath. Adora was a cleric and was able to save the group of
        warriors, which included Herradon. It wasn&#146;t long after that Adora and Herradon fell
        in love and were married. The two were inseparable and fought together in many battles
        against the forces of darkness. </font></small></p>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">Eventually Herradon and Adora conceived a child. Since
        Adora was with child, the two of them did not travel as far from home as was normal. On
        one stormy night there was a knock at their door and out in the storm stood two elves, one
        male and one female, also with child. Their names were Ailwon and Liana. They said they
        were running from an evil wizard by the name of Gylurec and that they need a place to hide
        for just a couple of days. Doing what any follower of Mithaniel Marr would have done,
        Herradon and Adora concealed the elves for a couple of days and listened to the evil story
        of Gylurec. It wasn&#146;t until weeks later that Gylurec would discover the trail of
        Ailwon and Liana but some how he did. After returning home from a short visit to the
        neighbors Herradon opened the door to their cottage and found Gylurec standing inside.
        Herradon recognized Gylurec by the description given him by Ailwon and being the quick
        thinking warrior Herradon was he slammed to cottage door, drew his sword and leapt at
        Gylurec. Tragically Gylurec was an extremely powerful wizard and hit Herradon with a ball
        of fire before he could reach him. But the weight and momentum of Herradon&#146;s leap
        propelled his charred body toward the wizard and the wizard was pierced by Herradon&#146;s
        sword. It was not a mortal blow but it was enough for the wizard to exit in a flash of
        light. </font></small></p>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">Adora was distraught by her beloved husband&#146;s death
        but knew she also need to take care of her unborn child. Adora set about to devise a plan.
        She had read a spell in one of the ancient tomes in the Temple of Marr that would cast a
        permanent rune of protection upon a living being. The spell had not been performed in
        centuries because the caster always died. She enlisted the aid of Guldarn, who protested
        fiercely, but eventually bowed to Adora&#146;s wishes. Guldarn collected all the needed
        spell components and set up a room for the ritual. Adora eventually gave birth to the
        child known as Lonedor and upon his birth Adora cast the spell. The spell required all of
        her physical and mental energy to cast the rune of protection upon Lonedor. Adora was
        successful at casting the spell where upon she died and Lonedor was forever marked. Adora
        had succeeded at both tasks she had planned for. She protected her child as she left one
        realm and she was able to be re-united with her beloved husband in the next. </font></small></p>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">It was Adora&#146;s wish that Guldarn leave the baby with
        the paladins so he could know both the ways of a warrior, his father&#146;s ways, and that
        of a cleric, his mother&#146;s ways. Guldarn would secretly watch over Lonedor as he grew
        until Lonedor came of age and would learn of his mother and father&#146;s deaths.</font></small></p>
        <p align="left"><small><font face="Verdana">After hearing this story Lonedor wept but he was proud that
        he could follow in both his mother and father&#146;s footsteps. After much thought and
        reflection Lonedor chose his last name. He chose Blade to symbolize his father the warrior
        and Wise to symbolize his mother the cleric. Hence from this point on he was known as
        Lonedor Bladewise.</font></small></p>
