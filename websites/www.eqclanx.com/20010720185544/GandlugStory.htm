          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the Book of Heros&#146; from Nabitian D&#146;Ellios</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="2" face="ZapfHumnst BT"><img border="0" src="Raven%20Images/Gandlug6.jpg" width="260" height="232" align="right" hspace="3" vspace="3">My name is
          Nabitian, I am Erudite by birth and historian by choice. I collect
          tales of hero&#146;s and their exploits around Norrath. Elfs, Gnomes, and
          Humans alike I have had the pleasure to meet. However, this story is
          about a dwarf. Dwarves by all knowledge are gruff and solemn creatures
          who do not fit well into other societies but their own. Here is the
          story of an anomally. He is one who has forsaken his homeland for
          adventure. His name &#133;..Gandlug Batlehamer.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="2" face="ZapfHumnst BT">I stood on the
          dock with the wind blowing across my face. I could taste the salt in
          the air which blew in from the ocean that was spread out before me,
          deep dark blue waters which stretched towards the horizon. Suddenly,
          my attention was broken by the singing of the dwarven guard&#146;s. I had
          studied among this people for many years and learned their language,
          but the deep tones of the songs they sung was intense. Now, I see why
          these creatures where feared by other races as such fercious fighters.
          I moved from the dock to a well traveled road and started towards an
          area where the dwarves had let druids build at. It seemed a highly
          favored area of the druids as I also found it held magiks of some kind
          as the druids would travel using this as a portal to other lands. I
          have traveled this way many times but each time became sick at the end
          of the travel. One druid name Nickola told me once to just take the
          boats as this seemed an unhealthy way for me to travel, being many
          times I deposited my dinner in our landing spot.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="2" face="ZapfHumnst BT">I accepted a
          tranport following my map to the land of Karana, a land filled with
          mysterious creatures such as centaurs and bird men. This is where I
          met Gandlug Batlehamer. I happened upon a camp site where I could make
          out 3 adventurers sitting and talking. I recongonized one as a druid
          and was to soon find out her companions where a paladin and a warrior&#133;dwarf.
          She introduced herself as Alexedia, and I noticed she seemed more of
          the shy type she was not dressed as most of the druids I had meet she
          wore leather pants, a shirt which did little to hide her bosom, and a
          headress, whether this was for her diety or not I had not asked.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="2" face="ZapfHumnst BT">She introduces
          the others, a paladin of the high order named Lonedor, whom was
          dressed the part a rusty helm, but shined with great care, leggings of
          bronze and other items all highly taken care of , his behavior was
          with much humility as a paladin could muster. He bowed and saluted me.
          I returned the jesture.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="2" face="ZapfHumnst BT">But, my
          attention turned immediately to the dwarf who sat and eating. He bite
          into his food with the hungry tenacity of a polar bear. He looked up
          at me and in those dark eyes, Aye, I must say one eye as his left eye
          was closed by an ugly scar. And in those eyes I saw a battle worn soul
          with no time for subtles. He wore ruff ringmail armor and next to him
          laid a horned helmet with many dents, and an axe with many notches in
          it. I could tell he was much like the dwarfs in Kaladim I had met. He
          continued to eat as I spoke to the paladin and druid. I could not get
          over my interest in a dwarf who looked to be young by dwarven
          standards in a place so far from his native lands.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="2" face="ZapfHumnst BT">I begin making
          my way towards him when I heard an erie sound and the ground begin to
          shake violently. I noticed the Paladin and druid begin looking to the
          horizon.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="2" face="ZapfHumnst BT">And as I
          watched, the paladin drew out a bow and locked in an arrow given to
          him from the druid, who winked at me. I looked at her confused and she
          made her way to me. &quot;Watch storyteller, Lonedor is a great
          shot&quot;, said Alexedia in a whispered tone in my ear. I watched
          with eagerness as the tall slender man locked the arrow into the bow
          and aimed at a grey mass in the distance and let fly his the arrow,
          &quot;thwing&quot;, it sounded.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="2" face="ZapfHumnst BT">Next, the
          ground begin to rumble loudly as out of the distance a very massive
          elephant came running. I watched the paladin move back and draw his
          sword a 2 handed finely crafted blade. He then looked over his
          shoulder at the dwarf. &quot; Incoming you lazy son of basilisk&quot;,
          he shouted to the dwarf and as if a challenge had been issued forth I
          watched the dwarf drop his food with an grumbled insult and grab his
          helm in one hand and axe in the other and start running towards
          Lonedor&#146;s position. I felt a tug at my sleeve as Alexedia beconed me
          to move back. I did and watched in wonder as the two fighters took up
          position around the bull elephant, I had studied these too.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="2" face="ZapfHumnst BT">The enraged
          beast flailed at the two attackers as if a blind rage had over come
          it. However, it was never a match for the skills of the talented
          paladin nor could it match such ferociousness as the dwarf. I felt
          sadden by the whole scene the beast never stood a chance against these
          two, I would soon find out in later journeys' that not many monsters
          did, especially with a talented druid assisting them.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="2" face="ZapfHumnst BT">&quot;Bah, da
          ding ain't fit to eat&quot;, spat Gandlug after he tasted and spat the
          blood from his ax. I noticed something different from Gandlug as he
          was gruff but had a, guess you could call it a sense of humor. Gandlug
          seemed to be fond of Lonedor and Alexedia, in a dwarven way. He would
          repeatedly call Lonedor, chromedome or some other name that dealt with
          Lonedors' helm. He spoke of Alexedia with the lovingness of a big
          brother, which in dwarven terms meant she was trouble.</font></p>
