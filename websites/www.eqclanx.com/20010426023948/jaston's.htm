        Chapter 1</font><font size="2"></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">It wasn&#146;t all that long ago, now that I think about it.
        Mother and I out in the fields, we used to help farm for the Druids at their guild. Mother
        had always wanted me to be a Druid, but magic just wasn&#146;t my thing.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">I had often wandered off to Misty Thicket, and watched proud
        Warriors fighting against all sorts of creatures. I one day decided to join them. For me
        this was a proud day, as was it for my mother. She was so proud, she had bought me a brand
        new suit, made from raw hide. I had asked her where she got the money, she just smiled.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="Raven%20Images/Jaston1.jpg" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="308"></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">Our family had never been rich, so we knew how to pinch a copper
        to go the furthest. I wore the raw hide in honor of her for a few seasons of training. It
        was about my 4<sup>th</sup> or 5<sup>th</sup> season when I met my mentor. He was far
        stronger than I, on a visit home was, he would be cutting through Runny Eye to get to the
        Karans.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">I was in the midst of a battle that I was almost positive I could
        win. The goblin had laughed when I hit it with my arrow, but after a few swings of my
        blade, he began to be weary.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">The creature had run as fast as it could, but not fast enough, and
        I dealt the finishing blow. Unfortunately he had yelled for help loud enough to get the
        attention of Motoo. He began to attack me, I tried to defend myself, but it was no use. I
        ran as fast as I could, but the guards were to far away, I yelled and yelled, and finally,
        I couldn&#146;t here the creature behind me.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">I turned around to see a Halfling Warrior, the likes of I had
        never seen before. He wore full crafted armor, and wielded a gigantic Executioners Axe.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Are you ok son?&quot; He asked me.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&quot;I- I think so&quot; Was all I could squeak out. I was in
        total awe. He then bandaged me enough to walk me back to Rivervale.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&quot;My name is Jaston, I have to thank you for helping me back
        there, please come to dinner at my house tonight. Mother always loves company.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Thank you son, and please call me Poppen&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">We ate heartily, well, for us it was heartily, Poppen seemed to be
        hungry afterwards, but he didn&#146;t say anything about it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">Poppen later went for a walk through Rivervale while Mother
        cleaned the kitchen.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&quot;If you don&#146;t mind son, what happened to your
        Father?&quot; Poppen asked, as we neared our guild.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&quot;He, um, well, ya see, the thing is I never knew my father.
        Mother says he went out explorin&#146; one day and never came back.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Oh, I&#146;m sorry. Here, I know you are a good kid, so
        here, I want you to have some of my old equipment. They used to be my armor.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">Poppen went to the bank teller, and returned to me with a Bronze
        Breastplate and legs, and a langseax. I was so happy. I didn&#146;t know what to say, I
        could hardly manage a thank you.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">From that day I have looked up to Poppen as the father I had never
        had, he has guided me through everything I have done, and has helped me in so many ways I
        couldn&#146;t begin to thank him.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">When Poppen went to the Karans, I was left alone with Mother. It
        was one night in late September that I first got the vision. It was of Brell, he was
        beckoning me. I told Mother, she was taken aback by what I said, but she quickly excused
        it as childish imagination.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">This &#145;imagination&#146; didn&#146;t do away though. I kept
        getting more and more vivid Visions. Then one day, out of nowhere, I felt my body get
        gated away to somewhere new. I was told later t was the Plain of Underfoot, but for the
        time, I was too scared to care.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">I came to my scenes in front of a massive throne, atop it sat
        Brell himself.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&quot;JASTON!&quot; He boomed. &quot;My son! You have come of age,
        and it is beyond the time to speak to you the truth of your existence.&quot; He stopped
        for a moment, had his servants gather me food, drink, and a soft place to sit.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&quot;You my son are special&quot; He began again, &quot;Unlike
        most others whose existence upon Norrath won&#146;t amount to anything, you my son are
        destined for greatness. You are one of my chosen sons, my blood flows through your veins,
        and will give you the strength to overcome all one day.&quot; This was all unreal, I
        couldn&#146;t grasp what he was saying, but somehow I knew it to be true.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Your brother, he is the only other like you. He is a
        Paladin, from Kaladim. He is a Dwarf by the name of Caviat. You should visit him, together
        you will be unbeatable!&quot; Again he rested, he obviously wasn&#146;t used to talking
        for long periods of time.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Finally, I have one last deed for you to accomplish. Go to
        the Eastern Commonlands, and find a High Elf named Larton. Ask him for a compass, when he
        offers you one, ask him again. He will this time show you a rusted dagger. Take this. You

        <p><font face="Verdana">With that all went black again, and I awoke back on my bed at
        home, Mother was standing over me.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&quot;I must go to East Commons&quot; was all I said. She seemed

        <p><font face="Verdana">The Commonlands, oh how I despised them. Full of vile creatures
        and corrupt merchants, each fighting for the best price on everything. It has always
        seemed so senseless to me. I guess I&#146;m just old-fashioned thinking that the greatest
        item is the one you get yourself.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">None the less I was on a journey from Brell, I had to find Larton.
        He was very good at keeping himself hidden in a crowd. The type you don&#146;t know is
        there until he shows himself to you.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">Fortunately that is exactly what he did. I was about to venture to
        the desert to look harder, but he approached me from almost out of nowhere.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="Raven%20Images/Jaston2.jpg" WIDTH="188" HEIGHT="203"></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Little one, I know this will sound odd, but I have seen you
        before. Not in this world though, in another, in a dream almost.&quot; He had said. I
        almost jumped out of my skin. I was nothing more than a country boy, the thought of
        appearing in a total stranger&#146;s dream was almost too strange.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">But none the less, I was on a mission from my God. I had to see if
        he was the right one, the one that Brell had directed me to.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Sir, you wouldn&#146;t, umm, wouldn&#146;t happen to have a
        compass I could have do you?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Why of course, here, you will find none better in the
        land&quot; He said, just as Brell had told me, he showed me a normal compass.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Ummm, no sir, I meant a &#145;compass&#146;, do you have a
        &#145;compass&#146;?&quot; He seemed to understand then, because he walked me to a dark
        corner, gave me a rusty dagger and told me to hold it close to my heart at all times.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">That I have done to this day. Larton and I have met on several
        occasions since, as have I met many other guardians. One of the greatest ever was Cnyyen.
        He was a fine paladin. He saved my life many a time, and I have not the abilities to begin
        to thank him.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">He and I first went to see Caviat. We traveled for hours on a boat
        to cross to Kaladim. Almost as if Caviat was expecting me, he got up from the docks. We
        embraced as brothers, and talked long into the night. Cnyyen joined the merriment, and I
        must say, that night has lead me to become the alcoholic I am today.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">The morning came, and as we had decided the previous night, Caviat
        and I would return to the Commonlands and meet Larton, and Cnyyen would return to
        Kelethin. The plan was to have Caviat join us and become unbelievably strong. But it was
        not to be&#133;&#133;&#133;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">On the boat home, I experienced my second inter-plain travel.
        Caviat and I were transported to the Plain of Hate. Cazic Thule himself spoke to us, he
        spoke of the way of fear, of why he was far more powerful than Brell. He was desperate to
        have Caviat and I join him, that he offered us all of the land upon Norrath for our
        loyalty. I refused, as did Caviat, but he was not as fortunate as I to escape. Cazic
        grabbed a hold of Caviat and transported him to a plain he only knows of. I was far more
        fortunate, as Brell transported me to the Plain of Underfoot before Cazic could grasp me.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">Time went on, I continued to run errands for Brell. Cnyyen has
        come and gone, his memory still lies ingrained in my mind for eternity. As does that of
        Caviat. I wondered what Cazic had done to him. I imagined he had killed him, but I
        wasn&#146;t 100% sure.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">This is when the worst news of my life arrived. Poppen approached
        me one day, he seemed in a panic. He told me that we would be Teleporting to Misty
        immediately. He told me my mother had a incurable sickness, and she didn&#146;t have that
        much time left.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">Poppen and I arrived at my home to see Mother laying in bed. Large
        blisters could be seen all over her skin. I knew it was an act of a higher power, none had
        ever seen this plague before, and there seemed no way to cure it. Cazic knew he
        couldn&#146;t attack me directly without alerting Brell.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">I stayed by Mother&#146;s bed for 2 weeks, then one day, I woke,
        and, well, she didn&#146;t.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">That day was the worst imaginable, for no more than an hour after
        I found Mother dead, I heard a bitter laugh. Upon searching the house, I couldn&#146;t
        find the source, but it seemed to be following me. Then in a flash of light, a creature
        appeared before me. I was a hideous lizard creature I had seen before. These Iksar were
        some of the vilest creatures on the planet.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">This one was a necromancer, as I began to unsheathe my axe, it
        hissed in a unforgettable voice, &quot;Hello Brother&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">It was Caviat.</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" color="#D2A722" size="2">Through the eyes of
        Jaston<br>
        Chapter 3:&nbsp; The Tables Turn</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">It was almost instinct as of
          now. My axe was quickly in my hands, and I charged him headlong. How
          could I kill Caviat? My brother? No! He isn&#146;t! My mind was racing,
          but it seemed to be right to attack him, though even now I can&#146;t see
          why. Probably had to do with Brell and Cazic. Damn him till the day I
          die. DAMN YOU CAZIC THULE!</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">My attack seemed worthless,
          for Caviat merle sidestepped my swings. He began to cast a spell, and
          for a moment my heart stopped. I realized I was not wearing my armor,
          for that had been mother&#146;s only rule. &quot;No armor in the house,
          this is a place of peace, not of war.&quot; She had lectured me about
          that many times. But now I was doing battle with my &#145;brother&#146;
          here. She would be ashamed. The spell hit me hard, and I felt my life
          force begin to drain, but only momentarily. As quickly as the drain
          was felt, it vanished, and I felt a warm glow around.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Be safe child, for this
          road is a hard one.&quot; The voice of Brell rang in my ear, as an
          armor began to form on my body. This miracle was incredible. The armor
          was the normal I had always worn, but it seemed to be different,
          almost mystical.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">Caviat seemed unimpressed
          though, and continued his offensive. His spells had no effect on me
          though, but he continued to cast, using what seemed to be an unlimited
          mana supply. He would cast, I would slash, but neither of us seemed
          able of finishing the job.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">The air around us was filled
          with mystic powers as Brell and Cazic tried to give their pawns the
          advantage. Eventually I could not even tell where I was, I could only
          feel the magic, and my axe. The world around me seemed to be nothing
          but magic.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">I have heard tales that on
          this day, Earth Elementals rose from the grounds in Freeport, because
          of gigantic earthquakes. Or that hatred was at an incredible level,
          that even the best of friends would turn on each other at a moment&#146;s
          notice.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">The powers of hatred and of
          the Earth were so concentrated wherever we were, I am sure today that
          we were no longer in Norrath. But still the battle raged. Until, until
          I saw an opening. Caviat had left his guard down on his left side.
          With a swing of blinding speed I brought my axe into his cloak.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">I stood back in my house, in
          my farming breaches and old shirt. My axe trembled in my hands. On the
          floor was a crumpled robe. Caviat was nowhere to be seen.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">I needed to get out. The house
          suddenly felt as if it was collapsing upon me. I ran outside into the
          Druid&#146;s field, through down my axe, and began to weep.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Sir, are you ok?&quot;
          The sweetest voice I had ever heard said to me. I looked up to see
          what now defines the meaning of beauty for me.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">&quot;May Brell take me now,
          you are the most gorgeous creature I have ever laid eyes upon&quot; I
          said. Though the second the words were out of my mouth I vomited. She
          blushed and giggled, she must have thought me to be drunk, and oh I
          wish I had been. I wish it had all just been a drunken hallucination.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">She lead me into a small
          chamber of the Druid guild, the candles there made her hair sparkle
          like diamonds. She gave me some liquid, it made me cough, and she gave
          me a look of disapproval.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Well, if it&#146;s not
          liquor, what is it? Have you been feeling ok &#133; umm, what is your
          name anyway?&quot; She asked. I had the urge to tell her everything
          about Caviat, and Brell. But in her presence I could barley manage a
          &quot;Jaston, miss&quot;</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">She giggled again and began to
          go to work. She mumbled many times about magics and things she had
          never seen before, but never said anything to me about it. She never
          really did any healing, just tried to find out what was wrong.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">After an hour of these futile
          attempts, she let me go free, with a wink. I asked her name before I
          left, she blushed a bit and told me it was Tarratree. Oh what a name,
          I thought I was a float for the next week just watching her at work
          while I was in the fields. I had not looked at my axe since the
          encounter, and had no urge to pick it up again.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">Then one day, it was almost
          unimaginable, but I was watching Tarratree, and she took a small rusty
          dagger out of her blouse and looked it over. A Guardian? But how? I
          needed to ask her about it, for if she was a Guardian, she could help
          me with Cazic.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">I finally got up the nerve and
          asked her to the Fool&#146;s Gold Tavern in the middle of town. There we
          drank ourselves silly and regaled each other with stories from our
          various adventures.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">As we were sobering up, the
          sun was rising over the hills, and I asked her &quot;Do you have a
          compass?&quot;</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">She looked at me in
          astonishment, and brought out her rusty dagger, then for a moment
          looked as if she would use it against me, until I revealed mine. Then,
          un-expectantly, she leaned over and kissed me. Wow, my first kiss, it
          was incredible. Oh how I wished to save that moment forever. But that
          was impossible, for work was to start in an hour, and I had no rest
          that night.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">Weeks past, and Tarratree and
          I continued our dates, and under her request, I once again picked up
          my axe and began practicing. Then one day it all happened. EVERYTHING!
          Tarratree told me she was ready to see the world, and that I should
          come with her, to protect her, and to be hers forever. It was a dream
          come true! I accepted eager to see the world once again, but more so
          to be with Tarratree forever. But it was a tragic day as well. It was
          the day Brell decided to revisit me. He shouted at me for hours about
          Tarratree, that she was un-pure because she did not worship the
          Underfoot. He told me that if I left with her, he would not be
          responsible for the consequences, and warned that it would be
          fortunate if either of us lived for another year.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">I did not heed this warning,
          passing it up as divine jealousy. To this day I wish I had stayed
          home, but I didn&#146;t. We had made our way to the Northern Desert of
          Ro, we were on our way to the Oasis of Mar, but a familiar laugh
          caught my ear, as Tarratree&#146;s. Caviat appeared before the both of
          us, and before I knew what was happening, I was surrounded in hate. It
          encompassed me, as I tried to fight it, it just continued to consume
          me.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Jaston NOOOO!&quot; Was
          what brought me back. Tarratree was kneeling weeping over me. I could
          see the black magics of the Plain of Hate around us. Cazic Thule stood
          above us, Caviat at his foot.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Give it up Jaston, you
          are nothing without Brell, and you chose her over him!&quot; Caviat&#146;s
          shrill voice cut into me like a knife.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">&quot;You will never have me,
          I will sheath my blade upon myself before I give my self to you!&quot;
          I screamed. Cazic Thule seemed not to care for what I was saying as he
          began to cast a spell.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Jaston, I will love you
          for eternity. You chose me over your god, forever be safe my
          love.&quot; Tarratree whispered into my ear as she threw herself into
          the way of Cazic Thule&#146;s magic. It was the most tragic thing I had
          faced losing her, but at the time I still had a job to do. How can I
          defeat a God alone? Tarratree, please don&#146;t be gone, please. I began
          to run, away from them all, but my feet were stuck to the ground by
          some powerful magic.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Hmmm, nobody wants you
          to die, do they Jaston? Your mother had to be plagued before she would
          tell me where you were. But in the end she had Poppen deliver that
          message.&quot; Caviat hissed. &quot;I only wish I had been there to
          see her die, to actually find out how well my plague worked.&quot;</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Caviat, I swear, as I
          yet live, you shall never feel another breath in your lungs.&quot; I
          felt a sudden surge of power. My feet sprung forward toward Caviat,
          catching him completely off guard, as I gave him a fatal blow to the
          chest. He fell at my feat dead. All was normal suddenly. I was back in
          the desert, with two corpses at my feet. One of Caviat, the other of
          Tarratree.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">From that moment I swore never
          to touch a blade again, and hide myself far away from the rest of the
          world. I began to live in caves on Faydwer, and would only come out to
          gather food. I wanted not to get close to anyone, for the fear that
          they might be hurt.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">On one such trip, I found a
          girl that seemed to be in distress. She claimed she was ok, but I knew
          better. I trailed her for a few miles, she was trying to escape
          someone. It was obvious. I had no idea whom from, but I knew she would
          not be all right if they found her.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">&quot;I know you are there
          little one, please, if you wish to protect me, stand by me, and not
          away&quot; She introduces herself as Rixma. She said that if I was to
          help her I would need to arm myself. The only weapon I had was my
          rusty dagger. I pulled it out, and to my surprise she took it from me,
          and said she had once had a compass. She told him how she had been a
          Guardian, and I listened, she was ok for a Wood Elf. Damn Treefolk.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">She told me about Clan X, and
          how they had helped her. She said she knew I must have been running
          from demons to be this far from anywhere. They were understanding, and
          asked nothing more than she offered them.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">From that day forward I joined
          Clan X. Though I may still have the heart of a Guardian, X has been
          far greater a help for me. I have been able to talk with them, to see
          what I needed to see. I have come to many conclusions, and realize now
          that this is wear I belong, for now.</font></p>
