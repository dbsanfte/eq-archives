          more then three months after their betrayal of Dagnor and their march
          to the east, the newly freed Orcan slaves were left stranded with no
          place to call home. None of the Orcs had ever lived without the
          watchful eye of an ogre master looking over their shoulder, so now
          they were like children: wandering without knowing exactly what they
          were to do. The dwarves had made it clear in their pact that, while
          the kingdom of Kaladim was responsible for freeing the Orcs, they were
          still very much enemies. It was not an option for any of the Orcs to
          return west, so they each began plotting for a new place to live.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The decision was split three ways and the Orcs
          began to revert back to the methods of their ancestors: splitting into
          three differing clans. One clan marched north, taking residence in the
          familiar northern peaks of Rakthok's ridge and away from the careful
          eyes of the dwarves. The second clan decided to make the grassy fields
          of the loping plains their home. Even today this clan remains there,
          looting and plundering any caravans who happen to pass by. The third,
          and the largest clan, was lead by a young Orc named Gharol. He
          convinced the majority of the Orcs that true riches lied to the
          fertile lands of the east. There, he said, the Orcs would find there
          new home and the Crushbone clan, as he called his followers, would
          grow strong. It was at this time, as the Crushbone clan started making
          their way further east around the Wayunder Lake and straight for the
          greater Faydark that the elven lord of Kelethin began to take notice
          of their advancement.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The elves of Kelethin were tentative at first and
          the lord of Kelethin, an old elf by the name of Carandril, sent many
          messages to Gharol to ask what his plans were in moving his clan
          eastward. To this day no scholar can really be sure if Gharol was able
          to decipher the letters or not, as it is general knowledge that most
          Orcs can't read a word of any written language, but it is certain the
          Orcan lord was angry to find that another race had already taken
          residence in the eastern lands. Carandril never saw any messengers he
          sent out again, as they were all killed by Gharol immediately as the
          letters were exchanged. Acting purely on his instincts, the leader of
          the Crushbone clan told his followers of this &quot;new&quot; race and
          how they had &quot;stolen&quot; the east from the Orcs. Gharol then
          started to plot a new plan which would entail the complete destruction
          of Kelethin and the enslavement of the elven race, as he thought
          Kelethin was the only city of elves and the center for the entire
          elven empire. Both assumptions were false and the forces of Gharol
          were met with bitter, however surprised, resistance on the borders of
          the greater Faydark. Most of the Orcs leading this first attack were
          killed and the rest were turned quickly away. Angry at this new defeat
          and jealous of the elven strength, Gharol started to plot a new system
          of attack. He understood that most of his soldiers had been
          slaughtered from elves high in the treetops that would rain showers of
          arrows down on his forces. So for the second attack, Gharol put his
          Orcs into a long line of attackers, gave each soldier his own
          makeshift torch, and then ordered the entire host to run into the
          borders of the greater Faydark and burn whatever they could touch. The
          Crushbone Orcs set fire from everything to the tops of the trees to
          the grasses on the forest paths. Nothing but ash was left in their
          wake. The elven archers high in the trees were burned to death and the
          remaining elven soldiers, horrified and shocked at the tactics of
          their strange enemy, began to make a hasty retreat. The wood elves
          would later call the incident &quot;The Great Burning.&quot;</p>

          <font SIZE="2">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was on that fateful day that Andaran and his
          family were out in the forest enjoying the day together with friends.
          Eryndale, Andaran’s wife, and Glidara were teaching their daughters
          how to find their way, and some of the useful plants and herbs the
          forest has to offer. The men were teaching Yarrl, Andaran’s only
          son, to hunt. &quot;Yarrl, we will all eat tonight on what you find so
          find something big we are hungry!&quot; laughed Andaran. He was an
          average size elf but looks could be deceiving because there was
          nothing average about him. He was Captain of the Guard in Kelethin as
          strong as a wooly mammoth, quick with a blade, and very nimble. He was
          a man of great honor and was very well respected in town and known for
          keeping his word. He loved his family most of all and was a kind
          father.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yarrl was coming of age and it was time to teach
          the things he needed to know about the ways of the forest and of
          Tunare and how they work together. Andaran however knew that Tunare
          blessed and watched over his child because he could see more in him
          than a warrior. Just then he saw Yarrl stand up from behind a bush
          cocked his arrow and released it all in one seamless motion as if the
          bow was part of him. Thrip<b>!!!</b> The arrow sizzled through the
          air. The deer heard the noise that Yarrl made standing up and started
          to run but it was to late. The arrow caught the deer in the base of
          the neck, a perfect shot. The deer tried to get up to run again after
          being forced down by the arrow but as it got up another arrow found it’s
          mark and brought it down. Bryn and his son Amarath were amazed at the
          speed and accuracy that Yarrl showed, as this was his first hunt.
          &quot;Great shot son!! We shall eat for a week! Thanks also to Tunare
          for providing us this food and a good hunt!&quot; Andaran pulled out
          his dagger and showed Yarrl how to dress the animal so that he could
          carry it back. The men were an hour away from the campsite and had a
          long walk back. Yarrl had the deer over his shoulders carrying it
          back. They were all smiling and laughing at the day’s events and
          Yarrl was going over with his father how he had tracked it and what
          his thoughts were as he shot it.</p>

          <font SIZE="2">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we walked into camp I wanted to shout the great
          news to my mother. &quot;Mother look at…..what…I….&quot; It was
          a sentence I never finished. I stood there and saw blood all over the
          area. My sister and her friend were hanging by a rope with their neck
          broken and Glidara’s body was lying on the ground with her head
          missing. Then I fell to my knees as my strength left my body and I
          looked to see that my mother was tied to a tree beheaded and her
          unborn child lying at her feet cut out of her. Before I had time to
          react I noticed that the shadows around us started to move. Just then
          4 arrows sizzled by me and landed on Amaranth and he fell to the
          ground. A Tier’dal appeared from behind him to finish the job and
          cut off his head with 1 quick blow. Then 2 more arrows came flying at
          me and landing in the dear that I was carrying on my back. I turned
          around to run but the Tier’dal that killed Amarath was beginning to
          swing his sword onto me. I though it was the end but I saw my father
          interpose sword in hand and killed the Tier’dal.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Orcs had been waiting for us to return. Gharol
          knew that Andaran was out in the forest today and sent his son Darish
          with a small party of emissary’s to kill him. The Tier’dal who
          were in league with the Orcs were spying and knew that if the Captain
          of the Guard was killed then the elf army would be in disarray. Darish
          was told to kill them and let none survive. Darish and two other
          emissaries went into battle with Andaran and the other two went after
          Bryn and myself. I was unarmed and scared to death. &quot;Yarrl run
          back to Kelethin and get help!&quot; That was the last time I heard my
          father’s voice. As I started to run Darish ordered his men not to
          let me escape. Andaran heard this and turned to make sure I was on my
          way. Darish took advantage of the moment and killed Andaran. Darish
          chopped off his head and put it on a pike and returned to his father
          who would later the next day lead the attack with it.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bryn while fighting witnessed this and now knew
          that he was now out matched and out numbered, he said something to
          himself and could feel the muscles in his legs get bigger and he
          started to run. As he got closer to me I suddenly felt my legs feel
          stronger and I was able to run faster than I ever ran before. He
          grabbed me and told me to follow him. I did exactly that and I could
          see that he was taking me back to the safety of the city. I could here
          the Orcs in the distance chasing us but were falling behind and arrows
          were raining down falling just short of hitting us. As we got closer
          to town we could see the Orc army preparing their torches and we were
          unable to find away around them to warn Kelethin. Bryn looked at me
          straight in the eyes and said, &quot;We can do no more here. It is in
          Tunare’s hands now. We must find a safe place to stay for Lord
          Darish will be sure to be on the lookout for us.&quot; We hid the rest
          of the night in the forest; I did not sleep a wink. At sunrise we did
          not go back to Kelethin but we went to the outer edges of the forest
          known as the Lesser Faydark where Bryn’s outpost was located. He
          gave me a drink of a sweet liquid and I fell fast asleep almost
          immediately.</p>

          <font SIZE="2">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I woke up two days had passed but I was in the
          same location. I heard voices in the other room talking and I listened
          to them &quot;…we then rounded up as many as we could find and
          killed them. The scouts of Tunare are reporting that most are fleeing
          in all directions with the biggest group of them making what appears
          to be a rather large camp on the other side of the mountains to the
          north, another group of Orcs are making camp here in the Lesser
          Faydark and even a third, the smallest group, near Kaladim, we have
          already warned the Dwarf King. Now to matters at hand. Bryn all of
          Kelethin is sorry for your loss of wife and son and daughter. We have
          found them and brought them here for you so that their sols can
          complete the trip to The Mother, all of Kelethin morns of them as
          well.&quot; I did not recognize the voice that was speaking but with
          everyone here at attention and the high guards that he brought with
          him I knew that he was important. &quot;Bryn with the losses that
          Kelethin suffered and this new threat in the land the council has
          decided to make this a full outpost with you in command to keep check
          on the Orcs here. It has also been decided that Yarrl is to remain
          here under your training and will report to me as well. His father and
          I had talked several times about his special abilities. Being of age
          like he is if he hasn’t noticed them yet he soon will. How is the
          boy anyway?&quot; Then I hear Bryn speak. &quot;He is fine. He
          suffered no injuries during the battle but as can be imagined is very
          confused. I did give him a herb that put him to sleep two days ago and
          he has not woken up yet. Thank you Mason for bringing my family back
          to me and also thank the council for the opportunity to defend
          Kelethin and Tunare against the these foul creatures.&quot; Maesyn
          spoke, &quot;We have a lot to do in Kelethin, there is much rebuilding
          and I must return before the Orcs try again. Tell Yarrl he is not
          alone there are other orphan children as well. I know that it will be
          hard on him for a while but he will do ok and Tunare will watch over
          him and all her children to keep them safe.&quot; As they were talking
          they were headed out side so I could not hear anymore. I could now see
          Maesyn and he was tall for an elf with dark hair and carried a great
          bow with him and a quiver full of arrows and a sword at his waste. He
          shook hands with Bryn while Bryn bowed to him and they left through
          the woods. The memories of what had happened to me over the last days
          started to come back in a rush. I could see my mother’s body against
          the tree; I can see the look of horror on my father’s face and the
          smile on the Dark Elf as he was about to swing at me. I also felt a
          rush of uneasiness and disgust as I remembered. That feeling turned to
          fear from the Dark Elf and then to hatred and then finally to revenge.
          The rush of memories and feeling that I had was to much I started to
          cry and with the herb still in me I was asleep again.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While asleep the dreams that I had were horrible. I
          could see the Orc in command giving the orders to kill me, and my
          father getting in their way and their swords going threw him. I could
          also see the Tier’dal swinging at me again and again and laughing at
          me telling me that I will die. My mother was there also telling me to
          run. I suddenly woke up, or thought I woke up to a gentle voice
          calling to me. I went outside to see what it was and saw the most
          Beautiful women I had ever seen. It was Tunare. I don’t know how I
          knew it was Tunare but I just knew. As I looked upon her, I noticed
          her beautiful white robe flowing in the wind although I felt no
          breeze. Her hair was as golden as the rays of the sun, and her eyes as
          the bluest sky. As I stood there in awe, beside her appeared a pure
          white unicorn. My mind cleared and I felt no remnant of the past few
          days. As I knelt before her she placed her hand on my shoulder and
          spoke to me. Her voice was like the gentle wind blowing through reeds
          on a summer night. &quot;My child, I am so sorry that you have had to
          go through such tragedy at such an early age. This heartache will not
          be short lived, but to ease the pain, you must know that your family
          is with me now and I am taking care of them. They are receiving the
          peace and love with me that they deserve. They have done my work and
          are now receiving their reward for their love and obedience. Your work
          has just begun. You will become strong and powerful and will be
          protected by my hand. You must take under your wing a younger
          follower. When you are with her, you will know that she is the one of
          which I speak. She will fall and you must let her take this path
          before you help her. Seek out Maesyn Trueshot and follow his wisdom
          for it is inspired by me. Fear not my child I am with you.&quot; As
          she stated these last words the unicorn went into the forest and she
          dissolved into a million fireflies that blanketed the forest. I awoke
          with a feeling of calm like never before, I was clear headed. I knew
          that revenge would be mine.</p>

          <font SIZE="2">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several months had passed since my dream. Maesyn
          and Bryn had taught me to focus my anger and energy into my training,
          I heeded Tunare's words and thought of them often. I had also
          discovered that have the ability to use magic. Maesyn helped me
          harness and control its power. I traveled back and forth from the
          outpost to Kelethin once a week with the supply train. While in
          Kelethin I was always on the lookout for the one Tunare had told me
          about. Kelethin though is such a big city with so many people there I
          did not see anyone that it could be. Maesyn did speak of another and I
          did watch him train her one day. She was very strong and cunning but I
          could see the defiance in her eyes. During my traveling, our caravan
          usually attracted followers passing through the forest to or from the
          adjacent areas. On one such journey we had come across a dwarf and
          what looked like a elf although her ears were not as sharp as mine and
          she was a little taller. I had seen Dwarves before and find then to be
          fair and jolly folk, he called himself Denithor. Her kind on the other
          hand I had never seen before and I couldn’t help but stare at her.
          She called herself Zoberra. &quot;What are you looking at elf? Stop
          staring at me it makes me nervous. You elves always think you are
          better than us. Well your not !!&quot; Zoberra was looking sternly at
          me at this point. &quot;Zoberra be quite he was kind enough to offer
          us traveling and logging for the night I’m sure he meant no
          disrespect.&quot; Denithor said as he looked at me for approval.
          Denithor looked like a normal dwarf. He was in leather armor though
          and I could see that he carried around his neck a symbol I had never
          seen before and a mace at his side. &quot;Oh…uh…yes…. I am sorry
          Zoberra? …did you say? I did not mean to stare M’lady. What do you
          mean us elves always think we are better than you? Are you not a
          elf?&quot; This time Zoberra stared at me with one of her eyebrows
          raised and Denithor started to laugh he said, &quot;Now you did it.
          Think carefully of what you say next or she shall teach you a lesson….hehe.
          Have you never seen a half elf?&quot; Zoberra could see the confused
          and blank look on my face as Denithor continued to snicker. &quot;A
          half elf?…&quot; was all I could get out.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The driver had stopped the wagon and called for me.
          As I got up front I could see that the wagon that left Kelethin one
          hour before we did was destroyed on the road in front of us. I drew my
          sword and jumped down and went to the other wagon. Denithor and
          Zoberra got out and also looked around, as well as the driver with his
          sword. I looked down at the two bodies lying there I could tell that
          one had been killed but the other was still alive but badly hurt. I
          immediately began a chant to my self in the ways that Maesyn had
          taught me and I could feel the energies from my body surround his and
          he woke up and felt a little better. &quot;Yarrl it is good to see you
          thank you.&quot; Said the injured elf. &quot;You are most welcome are
          they still here?&quot; I helped him up and Denithor came over to help
          me take him back to the wagon. &quot;I do not know. I just remember
          them coming from over the hill over there.&quot; I could see Denithor
          place one of his hands around the symbol on his necklace and the other
          on the wounded elf and he healed him greater than I was able to. I
          told them to stay here while I look around. I went to the broken wagon
          and could see the footprints and started to follow them. By the size,
          depth, number, direction of foot prints I could tell that there were
          about eight Orcs and three of which were rather large most likely a
          legionnaire while the others were smaller most likely pawns.
          &quot;They are not in the immediate area but are not far since these
          look fresh and they did head off in that direction. Denithor is he ok
          to travel?&quot; Denithor responded &quot;Aye of course he is I have
          made sure to his well being by the power blessed upon me by Brell.&quot;
          The driver of our wagon took the injured on with him back to the camp
          while Denithor, Zoberra and I went to hunt down the Orcs. I made good
          time following them since they were going through the supplies and
          leaving me a trail of litter. I could tell that they discovered some
          what must have been elven wine in the pack because they were slowing
          and staggering.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we caught up with them I could see that they
          were fighting over what I could gather was the last bottle of wine. I
          said another chant and the three of us could feel our skin get harder
          and whispered for us to take the Legionnaires first on my mark.
          &quot;May Brell watch over us all.&quot; As Denithor said that I could
          feel a rush of adrenaline surge through me. I took out my bow and two
          arrows, pulled back and released the first one right into the chest of
          the largest Orc. The Orcs were stunned for a brief moment and before
          they could react the second arrow hit right next to the first and the
          Orc fell mortally wounded. As I dropped my bow to unsheathe my sword I
          could hear a battle chant coming from Zoberra as she thrust her sword
          on the next Legionnaire, Denithor had his mace in hand and was on the
          third. &quot;By Tunare’s hand !!&quot; I yelled at the smaller Orcs
          that started to rush us and the grass under their feet began to grow
          and grab at them holding them in place. I turned my attention toward
          Zoberra and she was in need of some help. I rushed to her side and
          began to attack the Orc and draw his attention to me. With the
          Legionnaire out numbered he began to realize that he was not going to
          win this fight but pressed on to try. Remembering all of my training I
          was able to dodge his sword that he thrust at me and see that he was
          now off balance I immediately swung my sword and landed it right in
          his gut. Zoberra then finished him with a sword through the heart.
          Meanwhile Denithor was just to quick for the Legionnaire he was able
          to strike blow after blow against him and was no match to the magic
          fire that was enveloping him and he quickly fell. Upon seeing all this
          the smaller Orcs decided to run off and fight another day and cursed
          us as they ran. &quot;These raids have become much to common place
          nowadays.&quot; I mentioned. I then took Denithor and Zoberra back on
          a shortcut through the forest back to the outpost.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next day Zoberra and Denithor were packing up
          their things and getting ready to leave. &quot;Yarrl, why don’t you
          come with us to High Hold Keep. They are looking for good people to
          help them.&quot; Denithor asked. Ever since the battle in Kithicor,
          the forest is said to be haunted by the soldiers that died there. The
          Orcs that had taken residence there in the forest have been raging a
          steady conflict with the Keep in order to get out of the forest.
          &quot;I am sorry Denithor my place is here to watch over Kelethin, but
          thank you for your offer.&quot; I replied. Bryn had heard this
          conversation and knew that if I was to grow anymore then it was time
          for me to leave and to gain experience into the other parts of the
          world. &quot;Yarrl I have a job for you to do. You must go to Kithicor
          forest and deliver a message to Morin Shadowbane on the status of the
          outpost. He might know why the shadow men have been seen in these
          parts lately. I also want you to take my weapon with you. I know that
          you have watched me with it for sometime now and I know that it will
          be well taken care of. May it help you in times of need.&quot; He then
          handed me the note and the Orc Impaler. He was right I have watched
          him use and practice with it. I have even practiced with it myself
          when he was not looking. As he handed it to me I could feel the power
          that it held, it was a fast weapon and perfectly balanced. I thanked
          him and told him that it will be well taken care of.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We made good time on the way to the docks and got
          there two days later. Zoberra would sing songs of ancient places and
          times to keep us entertained while traveling. She had a beautiful
          voice and she knew a lot of the world. We camped for the night at the
          dock, Denithor found out that the boat would be here in the morning so
          he decided to get some fishing in before we went to sleep. Zoberra was
          playing her flute while I listed to the music. I was excited because
          this was my first time to see the ocean. The smell in the air, the
          sounds of the waves crashing onto the shore and Zoberra’s soft music
          matching the sounds of the waves was flowing from her and made me feel
          at peace. She stopped playing and stared at me. I looked like a kid in
          a candy store everything was new to me and she could see this in my
          eyes and enjoyed the fact that she was with me as I first experienced
          things and my reaction to them. &quot;Yarrl have you never been to the
          ocean before?&quot; I responded &quot;No this is my first time. I have
          read about it in my studies but to see it, hear it, and smell it is
          something a book can not teach. Isn’t it beautiful?&quot; She smiled
          at me and then said &quot;Yes it is. There are wonders in this world
          that I have seen and great beauty such as the great plains with the
          ancient wooden bridge that connects West Karana and North Karana that
          was built from giants of long ago, the deserts of Ro with a beautiful
          Oasis in the middle of it, the snowy peaks of Everfrost where ice
          giants are said to still be there, and the new tales I have heard
          coming from the newly re-discovery of Kunark. Yes this world truly has
          its wonders but it is also filled with evils and horrors that will
          make you wonder how the beauty comes through. Tomorrow Yarrl we will
          be in Freeport the largest city in Antonica and you will meet your
          first humans. They are a suspicious folk and can be easily swayed on
          rumor alone but once you earn their respect they can be a good
          ally.&quot; I listened to the words that she had said and thought
          about them for a bit. Denithor came back with a big fish and we
          started dinner, he also brought out of his pack some spirits.
          &quot;Here Yarrl drink some of this. It will put hair on ya chest.
          Dwarven ale from Tumpy Tonic in Kaladim, the best pub in all of
          Faydwar. That elven wine is to delicate for me. Cheers and good luck
          to us !!!&quot;</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one was faster than I to get off the boat. It
          was a horrid experience and I could not understand why so many people
          used that form of transportation. It rocked, it was hard to see or
          speak to other people, it was very buggy, I fell from the top deck to
          the main deck and injured myself during the fall and when it rained I
          went below but the rain still came through. Even if I tried to sit and
          wait it out I would feel sicker and sicker so I had to keep moving
          around. The dock was very crowded with all kinds of people. I saw,
          what I later learned to be, Gnomes, Halflings, Humans, Barbarians,
          halfelfs, and other elves like myself and some from Felwithe. It was a
          very busy place and I could hear people buying and selling and
          trading. I even witnessed some fighting and stealing that the guards
          had to break up. I looked very small in this city and missed the
          woods; there was not a tree in sight. &quot;Yarrl come over here there
          is someone you should meet.&quot; Zoberra said as she waved for me to
          come over. &quot;This is the help that you brought back with
          you?&quot; said a very very tall human that had his face painted.
          &quot;Ryne shut up we have seen him in battle and he is very
          good.&quot; Said Zoberra &quot;Aye, and he is also been trained in the
          ways of a Ranger and that is always helpful to us since we might not
          get so lost now after following you.&quot; Said Denithor. Ryne looked
          down at me disapproving of me and said &quot;Hail Yarrl I am Ryne
          warrior of Halas I’m sure that any assistance that you can provide
          us with will be helpful. Now lets move on we have a long journey
          ahead.&quot; I could tell that he was not happy to see me but I was
          not here for him so I didn’t care &quot;Is there a place here where
          I can get a book and pen and ink?&quot; I bought the supplies that I
          needed and since I was unfamiliar with the land every night I would
          document our travels and what I had seen and the places that I went to
          and the people that I met. I also drew maps as detailed as I could and
          kept a log of the items that looked eatable and what wasn’t eatable.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we reached the forest of Kithicor we found out
          first hand that the rumors of it’s haunting were correct. It was a
          beautiful forest by day but most evil at night. We decided early into
          the forest that we should make our way through it in the morning it
          seemed to be safer. It took half the day but we arrived to deliver the
          message to Morin Shadowbane, he was glad that everything was finally
          under control in the Faydarks. He also got the implied message from
          Bryn to persuade me from returning home. &quot;Well people lets get
          you all settled for the night&quot; He said. &quot;My limited magic
          will protect us over the night.&quot; Zoberra asked what happened to
          the forest to make it this way and why would an outpost have to
          remain. &quot;That is a good question M’lady it happened not to long
          ago……..&quot; Morin then proceeded to explain the story of what he
          called &quot;Bloody Kithicor&quot;. With great passion and charisma he
          told of how this forest was once part of The Surefall Glade and
          protected by Tunare and the Druids and Rangers of the area. He then
          spoke of the gathering of the evil armies for the metal that was found
          in the mountains and of the human and elvan army with Fironia Vie at
          the lead. He described her as if she was here, with every detail and
          movement that she made and the respect and passion in his voice moved
          us all. He described how she was able to rally the troops and turn the
          tide of the battle to her favor and how Innrok came and defiled the
          forest and trapped the souls of the dead to make them wander the
          forest for all eternity with no where to go. His story was moving and
          emotional. Zoberra wanted more information and details but Morin said
          that we should get some rest. He finished with explaining that he has
          made it his responsibility along with the others in camp to bring
          normalcy back to the forest and to find a way for the lost souls to
          return. That night I did not get any sleep after replaying Morin’s
          words in my mind and hearing the noises of the night I realized that
          evil exists all across the world and not just Kelethin, I could also
          hear that Zoberra was still awake softly singing to herself putting
          music to Morin’s story. I decided to stay with the others and go on
          to High Hold Keep.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the next six seasons the four of us remained at
          the Keep to help defend it against the almost constant attack from the
          Orcs, Gnolls and Goblins. I sent letters back to Bryn as often as I
          could explained what I had been doing and what I have seen. I was also
          amazed at the reputation that the four of seemed to be getting. We
          helped the supply runs into the Karanas and up to Qeynos and Halas and
          even into Rivervale. We protected and helped several people in the
          area on the pass or threw the pass. Even the Orcs, Gnolls and Goblins
          began to fear us. Everyone seemed to know of us and what we have done
          at the Keep. Zoberra and I often on our free time would go and sing
          and drink a little in the bars and pubs while Denithor would watch
          over the sick and wounded and spread the influence of Brell to all he
          met. Ryne was always on guard and ready at a moment’s notice to get
          into action. Both he and I grew to respect each other and our
          abilities. When the four of us were together however we almost
          unstoppable. We worked well together and each person knew his or her
          role and what was expected from each other. On our seventh season we
          started to here of the rumors of the great re-discovery of the lands
          of Kunark. Even the old-timers knew of this land from rumor only and
          now that it was rediscovered, the stories that came from there sounded
          so strange. I couldn’t understand how an entire race of beings could
          collapse into nothingness for so long. Then the stories started to
          come from Kunark about the capture and kidnapping of Fironia Vie. The
          next day we set out for these strange new lands that we heard so much
          about. After about 3 months worth of travel we finally made it to
          Kunark and the outpost of Fironia Vie and made ourselves available to
          the outpost and it’s needs.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For two years we stayed together and searched and
          explored the areas in Kunark and while in the Frontier Mountains I
          started to have strange dreams about Kelethin, Tunare, and a woman I
          have never seen before. This woman was in trouble and needed help and
          I could hear her crying out to Tuner for guidance. The dreams started
          to get worse and become more frequent and for the first time since it
          happened I started to remember the death of my parents and now this
          new woman. I had asked Denithor for council to see if he could help
          me. &quot;Denithor, I can’t get these visions out of my head. I can
          no longer focus. What should I do?&quot; &quot;It seems,&quot; he said
          &quot;that you are being called back to Kelethin for some reason. I
          cannot know for sure but something is calling you back to there. Aye
          it has been awhile since we have been there, could this be related to
          your vision that you told me of?&quot; Denithor was the only other
          person that knew of the vision I had of Tunare and what she had said
          to me. As a follower and cleric of Brell he has a gift of insight and
          wisdom that I respect greatly. &quot;I have thought about that as well
          and I don’t know the answer.&quot; I said. &quot;Then go. Pack up
          your gear and go now back home and face this. Maybe Maesyn can assist
          you further than I can.&quot;</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It took me a month to get back to Faydark. It was
          good to see the trees again and to smell the air of the forest. It was
          night but I knew the way like the back of my hand and I had a smile on
          my face. I went a longer way back to Kelethin because I wanted to
          enjoy the forest a little more before town. As I walked I caught some
          movement out of the corner of my eye. Instinct took over and I
          immediately blended into he shadows of the Forrest and moved silently.
          I could see ahead of me about five people all with weapons drawn
          moving carefully toward Crushbone. One of them turned around to look
          behind them to see if anyone was following and looked what seemed
          right at me. I was completely camouflage and not to far back and when
          they turned around I froze. I could then tell it was a woman and she
          had blonde hair. I very quietly drew my sword and continued to follow
          them and stay hidden. I could tell that by the route they were taking
          they wanted to go into Crushbone itself. I thought to myself that they
          were being foolish and what did they hope to accomplish. As we came
          upon the entrance to the castle I watched as they did away with the
          first three guards and hid the bodies. They were quick, quite, and
          deadly as if they had been practicing. As they moved in I again
          quietly followed staying in the shadows. Again the woman looked back
          as if she knew someone was following and she looked at my direction
          several times but could not see me, she was not following her
          instincts, I could tell that she was very good but just inexperienced.
          Even though I could see her look over here I still could not make out
          any detail about her except her blonde hair. I again followed them
          this time to the back of Crushbone where I could see that they were
          going to free chained captives that were being held there. They were
          successful and killed the guards and set free the captives. I was
          beginning to think that this was a good idea after all but then they
          made their mistake by letting their inexperience show through. I could
          see that they were letting the moment and feeling of invincibility
          take control of them and they started for the castle. As I started to
          move to follow, a Legionnaire came up from behind me on patrol and I
          froze. He did not see me but he did see the dead guards and missing
          prisoners. Before he could sound an alarm I unsheathed my sword and
          became visible, thrust the sword up and into him and covered his mouth
          to keep him quite as long as I could, he died instantly. As I started
          to make my way to the others I could see I was to late they were
          already in battle and it looked like one was dead already. I could see
          that the blonde was holding off two Legionnaires and an Elite while
          the others were trying to get away and more Orcs were coming. She was
          bleeding and tiring and screaming out &quot;Tunare help me now or take
          me.&quot; I could see the tears running down her face, it seemed as if
          she was giving up. I suddenly realized that this was the moment that I
          had seen in my dreams, it was her calling out for help from Tunare,
          and it was her spirit that was keeping her alive but it was fading
          fast and she started to fall. I quickly channeled most of my energies
          to her and I could tell she felt it. The Orcs looked a little
          surprised at her rejuvenation. &quot;By Tunare's will!!&quot; and I
          threw out my hand and the roots and grass around the Orcs started to
          tangle their feet. Now they turned and saw me and started to come my
          way I was able to get one shot off with my bow that struck the Orc in
          the neck and he collapsed instantly. When he fell I could see that
          there was an oracle casting yet another spell on to the woman and she
          screamed as it hit her. I rushed to her side and began to attack the
          Orcs and draw their attention to me. She had defeated one of the Orcs
          but again was bleeding. &quot;Go !!! Run !!!&quot; I yelled to her.
          &quot;I started this and I will finish it with you!&quot; she said. I
          again channeled more of my energy to her and as I did the Orc took
          advantage of my weakness and thrust his sword into my gut. I could
          feel the blade being pulled out and at the same time my skin felt like
          it caught on fire and I screamed in pain as the oracle laughed. I was
          staggering but able to concentrate enough to heal the wound some. I
          yelled again to her &quot;GO!! RUN!! DON’T BE FOOLISH!!! MAKE SURE
          THE OTHERS ARE SAFE !!!&quot; Both she and I could see the other Orcs
          starting to arrive and she finally started to run. Again I yelled
          &quot;By Tunare’s will !&quot; and was able to slow them down. I was
          slowly retreating back to the entrance of the castle holding them off
          as long as I could for her to escape. It was just a matter of time and
          I was out numbered and weakening. I was able to kill 3 more before I
          could feel that again I was cut and this time I fell to one knee but
          kept on holding them buying her more time, I could here noises behind
          me running up and I thought to myself… is this it? When I looked up
          I could see that the Orcs were backing up and preparing a quick
          defense for a oncoming charge. All of a sudden elfvan soldiers rushed
          by me to engage the Orcs and I was grabbed by two others and led back
          to Kelethin. I could see that outside the castle the Orcan camps were
          also being attacked. I could tell that I had no more energy left in me
          and I was still bleeding and very weak. &quot;Did the others make it
          out?&quot; I asked one of the soldiers that was carrying me.
          &quot;Aye, they barely made it. They all look in bad shape though.
          What were you all thinking?&quot; I then blacked out.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I awoke a couple hours later in the morning to an
          empty room with just a bed, table and chairs, and a pounding headache.
          I could tell it was still morning because the sun was still climbing
          in the sky and the morning birds were still singing. I noticed that
          although I was weak and bruised all over my wounds were bandaged and
          my arm was in a sling. I got up out of bed and opened the door, there
          was a guard standing out in front of it and he said &quot;By orders of
          Maesyn no one is allowed to either enter or leave the room sir.&quot;
          and he closed the door. Since there was nothing for me to do I decided
          to get some rest and go back to bed. A couple hours later I awoke to
          Maesyn slamming the door as he stormed in. As fast as my weakened body
          could move I got out of bed and stood up at attention. He grabbed one
          of the chairs at the table and slid it to me &quot;Sit Yarrl.&quot; I
          sat in the chair and could tell by the look on his face that he was
          not happy at the moment, he was quite for some time and paced back and
          forth not even looking at me. &quot;The skirmishes with the Orcs still
          continue today with no end near. The main battle ended last night but
          the skirmishes continue. Just what were you doing there Yarrl?&quot;
          he said. I replied &quot;Maesyn I take full responsibility for what
          happened last night. I….&quot; But before I could finish he stopped
          pacing and looked at me, &quot;Yarrl you are my best student and a
          example to the others. Everyone in town knows of your deeds in the
          High Pass area and of your work in Kunark to help our brothers and
          sisters there. The maps and journals about the different lands that
          you have sent back to Bryn are used in class to teach the young. I
          have already talked to the others and they had no idea that you were
          even there so why do you lie and take responsibility for something you
          had no part in?&quot; I looked at him and said, &quot;I take full
          responsibility because I did not stop them.&quot; He sat on the bed
          and looked at me and was sad &quot;Yes that would have been the right
          course of action but the decision has already been made by the counsel
          to ban the one who is responsible.&quot; I was surprised to hear that
          &quot;This was her second time to go into Crushbone and cause
          trouble.&quot; &quot;Is this the blonde woman that you speak of?&quot;
          I asked. &quot;Aye, Meassi is her name, you and she come from a very
          similar past. She was going to be my next great student but she lacks
          the focus and discipline that you have. She is a very strong and quick
          learner and has a sharp mind. I have persuaded the counsel not to make
          it a permanent ban but she is at a very difficult crossroad now and
          must decide for herself which way to go. She has the potential to do
          great things but her undisciplined, recklessness, and emotion prevent
          her from choosing the right way.&quot; I asked if it were possible to
          see her. &quot;She is allowed to see no one and is severely wounded
          but I understand that because of you the loss of life was minimal, I
          will see what I could do.&quot; He then paused for a moment and looked
          at me and smiled &quot;Yarrl even under these circumstances the town
          is happy to see you again and they have rewarded you a Trueshot
          Longbow for rescuing the young ones. It is good to see you again, you
          have been gone for several years and have grown up and come back a
          man, I see much of your father in you and he would be pleased. I must
          go now to attend matters at hand with these Orcs. Please join me later
          I would like to discuss and hear of your journeys.&quot; I told him
          that I would be honored and bowed to him as best as my injuries would
          allow. He opened the door and left and took the guard with him.</p>

          <font SIZE="2">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Later that night I was given permission to enter
          Meassi’s room. Her room was still under guard. As I approached, the
          guard stepped out of the way to let me open the door. When I got to
          the door I reached out to open it but I paused. Just moments ago I was
          ready to go in and see her but now it seemed different. The words that
          Tunare had spoken to me came back into my thoughts, &quot;When you are
          with her, you will know that she is the one of which I speak.&quot; I
          became hesitant, scared, and unsure of myself. I stood there in a
          daydream with my hand reached out to open the door. &quot;Are you ok
          sir?&quot; asked the guard. &quot;What?…..Oh…yes thank you.&quot;
          I managed to reply. I took a deep breath cleared my mind from all the
          doubts and opened the door. I walked in and looked upon her lying in
          the bed. The guard closed the door behind me but I didn’t hear or
          notice it. It was as if time suddenly stopped as I gazed upon her. The
          only movement in the room was the flickering flames from the fire,
          which cast a soft orange-yellow glow about the room and caused the
          shadows to look as if they were dancing along the walls. She too, was
          bandaged up and bruised some but I did not notice it. What I did
          notice was the most beautiful elf I had ever seen she was truly a gift
          from Tunare onto this world.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I sat next to her in the chair by the bed and held
          her hand and prayed for Tunare to watch and make sure that she is all
          right. Her hair was long and golden as Tunare's was and rested upon
          her shoulders. With my free hand I gently brushed some of the hair
          that was on her face off to the side. As I did this she moaned and
          stirred in her bed and lightly squeezed my hand and although she did
          not wake up she smiled. A warm tingle encompassed my body. Seeing her
          smile made my heart leap. I could not shake the memory of Tunare’s
          words to me. I knew right away that she was the one that Tunare spoke
          of. Lying there, still, sleeping, I knew she would be with me forever.
          I knew we were meant to be together. But how can this be, how can I
          have met the love of my life and all I have said to her was that she
          was a fool? This beautiful gift from Tunare lying before me and I can’t
          seem to think of words to describe what I am feeling at this moment.
          How can you put a lifetime of longing into a simple sentence?</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then, suddenly, as if caught in a rainstorm, a
          flood of emotions hit me hard. How could I have let this happen? How
          could I let my true love put herself in danger? How could I have let
          her go into that awful place and get so badly hurt? What kind of a man
          am I to just watch as they crept into Crushbone? Knowing what was in
          store for them, I didn’t stop them, I sat and watched until it was
          too late. The words from Tunare also replayed in my mind &quot;She
          will fall and you must let her take this path before you help
          her.&quot; How could I, after just now finding her, let her fall? Why
          can I not help her in this time of need? As I sat there, reliving the
          events and thoughts in my mind, I began to weep, for the second time
          in my life, I cried. Just as if I was hit with an arrow in the stomach
          I doubled over with pain. Summoning all my strength, I dried my face,
          pulled the chair close to the bed, and held her hand to my heart for
          the rest of the evening.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next morning when I had returned to her room a
          small crowd had gathered. Meassi had apparently woken up and I could
          hear Maesyn’s voice in the room talking. After a few minutes Maesyn
          open the door and started to look around. When he saw me he came to me
          and told me that Meassi had asked to see me. &quot;I have allowed it.
          If you wish to see her you may have a few minutes while I gather her
          things.&quot; When I walked into the room she looked at me and started
          to cry. I sat down in the chair next to the bed and held her hand. I
          brushed a tear from her face and said, &quot;I am so glad you
          lived!&quot; She looked at me and our eyes met for the first time and
          I could see that they also like her hair matched Tunare’s and she
          said, &quot;Had it not been for me you would never have gotten these
          injuries. It was so stupid of me to agree to go into Crushbone. I
          should have known better, I know that now, but that won’t bring
          Kablam back to life nor will it take away your injuries. Oh Tunare I
          may have damaged you for life!&quot; I could tell that she was being
          very hard on her self so I tried to cheer her up and said &quot;Nooo
          they are merely flesh wounds, these measly Orcs are no match for me. I’ll
          be ready to fight them again any day now! Don’t underestimate my
          strength!&quot; I smiled at her. She looked down onto the bed now and
          said &quot;I have been banned and must leave this town in a few
          minutes. Please forgive me and thank you for saving my life. I will be
          forever in your debts. I hope someday I can repay you for your doings…&quot;
          I told her &quot;You can. Get better and take up fighting again, that
          would please me. I saw you fight in there and you made me proud to be
          a elf, you will be a great fighter one day Meassi.&quot;</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At that moment Maesyn came back into the room and
          asked me to leave. I went outside and stood behind the crowd that had
          gathered, there were more than before. A couple minutes later Meassi
          came out of the hut and noticed the crowd. I could see the hurt,
          shame, and embarrassment on her face. I wanted to reach out to her and
          help her but I could not. As she passed by the people that were
          gathered there they turned their backs to her, a sign of the banning.
          As more and more people turned their backs she started to walk faster
          and faster to the lift. I wanted to help her and take her into my arms
          and hold her and tell her it would be ok. I did not turn my back on
          her although I don’t think she noticed. When she went down the lift
          Maesyn was looking at me, he was sad, he also noticed that I did not
          turn my back on Meassi. He came to me and said &quot;Why don’t you
          come back with me to class. Today we are going over some of your maps
          and journal’s from Halas and Everfrost. I’m sure that they would
          much rather like to here it from you rather than me.&quot; I declined
          the offer and asked if I could take my leave and head back home to
          Lesser Faydark. &quot;Aye go ahead, I know that you are anxious to
          return since you have not been back in so long. Bryn will be happy to
          see you. There should be a supply wagon heading back today.&quot; I
          took the wagon back to Lesser Faydark and when I had returned Bryn
          came out to meet me. We hugged and I smiled but he could tell that my
          injuries were bothering me and that something else was on my mind.
          &quot;Yarrl it is good to see you, I have heard of the recent events
          over the last few days and can see that you are tired. Go rest and we
          can talk later.&quot; I smiled at him and thanked him and retired to
          my room.</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the next year I traveled back and forth between
          home in Lesser Faydark, Kelethin, and Felwithe. During my time in
          Kunark I had offered my services for several of the paladins there and
          now that I was back in Greater Faydark they requested my help as well.
          I am always happy to lend my services to the Paladins of Tunare. I
          also helped Maesyn teach classes to the younger ones and he continued
          to teach me. Through his guidance I was able to regain my focus and
          thoughts and meditation more clearly. I was also able to channel my
          energies and learn more magic. I worked closely with Maesyn and the
          counsel on the Orc and Ter’Dal situation.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During my off time I would write letters to
          Denithor, he had asked me to keep him up to date on news of Kaladim,
          and I would listen to the stories of the new comers for news about
          what was happening in the world of Norrath. In one such letter I told
          him about the night I met Meassi and great sadness that I now feel
          because of my love for her and that I can not be there to help. On one
          such day I was in the pub smoking and writing a letter. I placed my
          pen on the table and had some of the fine imported Dwarven ale they
          served. The Bard was in the middle of a tale that got my attention; he
          had just arrived here from Qeynos. He was singing a tale of a woman
          fighter in Blackburrow that was a fantastic warrior but never showed
          emotion except sadness for events that she would not share to anyone.
          The bard’s tale was strong and moving and I felt sorry for the girl
          warrior in the story. When his story was over I tipped him several
          platinum pieces and left for the night in the rain.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next day I would find out would be a very
          interesting day. News broke from Ak’Anon and spread all through
          Norrath that a new land was discovered in the south. These new lands
          are believed to be where Veeshan originally brought life to the
          planet. The Gnomes called it Vellious and an ancient race of dwarfs
          were found there as well. That same day I also received a letter from
          Denithor saying that he, Ryne and Zoberra were coming back at the
          request of the king and that he had asked for me also. Not more than a
          couple hours later Denithor and Ryne appeared in Kelethin. &quot;Hail
          Denithor and Ryne.&quot; And I shook their hands and welcomed them to
          the city. &quot;Did you receive my letter Yarrl?&quot; Denithor said.
          &quot;Aye, I received it just a couple of hours ago. The King has
          requested our audience?&quot; I asked. &quot;He has indeed. It seems
          as if the Gnomes have discovered a new land in the south…..&quot;
          Denithor spoke but I did interrupt. &quot;Yes it was announced
          today.&quot; &quot;…..It was? Those darn Gnomes were to early with
          that, may Brell rust their little trinkets. We must go immediately to
          Kaladim, here read this and we will go.&quot; He gave me the message.
          It read:</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Denithor, I must take leave from Maesyn and
          the Counsel before I go and I must gather my belongings in Lesser
          Faydark. &quot; I explained. &quot;Ok we shall meet you at the dock in
          Butcher Block for the boat. If you are not there we set sail with out
          you so don’t be late. I am sorry to be in such a rush but I have
          been in constant contact with the King since the Gnomes told us a
          month ago. They have been there the last three months already and the
          King wants normal relations with our distant and lost brothers before
          some evil might happen.&quot; He explained. &quot;It is good you see
          you all, this will be like old times!! Where is Zoberra are we to meet
          her at the dock as well? I have missed her beautiful voice.&quot;
          Denithor and Ryne looked at each other and a sad expression were on
          their faces. I looked at Ryne puzzled. &quot;She was captured by the
          Iskar on our last day in the accursed land along with others that were
          part of the rescue party. She has not been seen since. We did however
          find her belongings a couple of days later but no luck finding her. We
          do not know what they wanted with her or the others but they were
          gone. That is why were are late getting here.&quot; He continued
          &quot;After you left to come here she did ask me that if she was to
          ever die to give you something.&quot; Ryne pulled out his backpack
          opened it and gave me her flute. &quot;She said that she always knew
          that you liked to hear her play it and wanted you to have it.&quot; He
          handed it to me and I stared at it and held it as if it were a fragile
          egg. Memories of the night waiting for the boat for the first time
          came into my thoughts and of other times that she played it came back
          to my thoughts I became angry and enraged and said in a low angry
          voice &quot;After this is over I will go back to those accursed lands
          of Kunark and kill those responsible for this !!&quot; I placed the
          flute very carefully into my backpack. I told them I would be there
          before the boat leaves and I left.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I went to see the counsel and Maesyn was already
          there. I informed Maesyn of the request and showed him the message.
          &quot;The stories that came out today are true then I see. Go then
          Yarrl, do as the King request and take this with you for you will
          represent all the elves.&quot; He placed an item in my backpack. I
          bowed to him and the counsel and was granted leave. &quot;May Tunare
          herself watch over you and your group to protect you.&quot; He said as
          I left. I then went back to Lesser Faydark to gather my remaining
          items. &quot;Bryn may I take the Orc Impaler with me again.&quot; I
          asked, &quot;Why do you ask me? It is and has been yours for quite
          sometime.&quot; He smiled to me. &quot;Wait though I do have something
          that you will need, these were your mothers and fathers items and is
          all that remains of theirs, they might help you in your
          journeys.&quot; He pulled out from the closet a box. He opened the box
          and inside was a suit of green armor, a sword, a bow, and a necklace.
          Bryn continued &quot;This is your fathers suit of Ivy Armor given to
          him by the king himself in honor of his service to Kelethin. The sword
          is an ancient sword called The Lamentation, It has been in your family
          for many ages and can no longer be produced, you will find that it is
          even faster and more damaging then The Orc Impaler. Lastly from your
          father is his bow, The Raincaller, given to your father when he became
          the Captain of the Guard. It was made long ago by Maesyn Turshot’s
          father, however it has been blessed by the Paladins of Tunare and is
          said to have the power of Tunare in it but I am sorry I do not know
          how to harness that power. Lastly is the necklace. It was a gift from
          your father to your mother on their wedding day. She never removed it
          from her neck.&quot; I looked at it and it was so beautiful. A string
          of white pearls with one black pearl in the middle. I clenched it in
          my hands, said a small prayer to myself and thanked Bryn for these
          treasures. &quot;Bryn thank you so much for these treasures that you
          taken care of all these years for me I thought I had nothing but
          memories of them but now I see that I have a part of them as well. You
          and your family will forever be remembered with mine and Tunare I know
          watches over you also.&quot; I put the suit on and it fit me perfectly
          it had the emblems of Kelethin on the chest and each bracer. It felt
          like chain mail but had Ivy cords sewn into the links, which gave it
          strength and a green look to it. The sword was surprisingly light and
          fast. I felt stronger while swinging it. The necklace I placed around
          my neck and vowed to never take it off like my mother did. The
          Raincaller was strong and taught and looked as if it was new. It had
          intricate carvings on it and one of Tunare that was amazingly enough
          just like her. It also had some runes on it that I could not read. I
          bowed and then hugged Bryn and in the ways that Maesyn had taught me I
          said the ancient words and I could feel the sprit of the Wolf enter
          me. I made my way to the docks.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I made it to the dock before the others and I sat
          down and waited. I opened my backpack and brought out the flute and
          held it in my hands. I could remember the beautiful music that Zoberra
          would play on it and I wished to here it again. I herd some people
          walk up on the dock so I put the flute back into the backpack and
          turned around. Two people were walking up to the end of the dock where
          I was standing, one of them was a Dwarf and the other was Erudian. He
          is an awful long way from home I thought to myself. &quot;Ah steward
          there you are. What time does the boat get here.&quot; He asked. I
          looked around but I was the only one here. &quot;Why do these people
          get more ignorant by the day?&quot; he mumbled to the dwarf then he
          spoke to me again this time and a rough elfish &quot;Steward what time
          does the boat arrive?&quot; Now that I knew that he was talking to me
          I looked back at him a bit puzzled and decided to have a little fun.
          In broken common I said &quot;The boat just left and will not be here
          until tomorrow night. May I have your bags sir?&quot; and I held out
          my hand for both a tip and his bags. As he gave me his bags (No tip
          mind you) and he continued to talk to the Dwarf. &quot;Well blast our
          luck we just missed the boat now we will be late and have to catch up
          to the others.&quot; Then the dwarf spoke &quot;Aye and if I know that
          Denithor he is in a rush to get there. Now we will have to find
          logging for the night.&quot; As they were talking I was not far behind
          them rummaging through his backpack, after all I asked if I could have
          it and he did give it to me. I was purposely making noise so that he
          would turn around. From What I could see of his backpack there were
          many odd things in it that I have only seen used by people that have
          much greater magic than I did. He turned around and had now seen what
          I was doing and was very upset. Again in broken Elfish he said
          &quot;Boy what are you doing?!!&quot; and drew a dagger out. I cowered
          and in broken common I said &quot;But you GAVE me you backpack after I
          asked for it. Don’t kill me sir!!!&quot; I dropped the backpack at
          my feet and coward back a step and tried to look as frighten as I
          could. He came over and yelled &quot;I did NOT give you my backpack I
          wanted you to take it to my room. I should kill you …..&quot; as he
          said that last sentence he bent down to pick up his backpack and I
          made my move. In one quick move I reached for and drew my sword
          wrapped one arm around him and the other with the sword up against his
          neck and in perfect Erudian I said &quot;Good day to you M’Lord. You
          should kill me? From the looks of it, it seems unlikely. Today is your
          lucky day and I am in a good mood. As you can see you are now at my
          mercy and some of us IGNORANT elves don’t take kindly when someone
          calls them a steward.&quot; Both him and the Dwarf were shocked but he
          was frightened. The dwarf had his weapon drawn but couldn’t do
          anything since his friend was between him and me. &quot;Now don’t
          you think a apology is warranted?&quot; I asked this time in perfect
          common. He said Yes…Yes…M’lord please forgive me.&quot; And with
          that I let him go with a shove toward the dwarf and put away my sword.
          Now showing off a bit I spoke to the Dwarf, this time in Dwarven,
          &quot;From your earlier discussion I take it you are waiting for
          Denithor?&quot; he put away his sword and said, &quot;Aye, he is to
          meet us here.&quot; Now back in common I said &quot;Good I am to meet
          him as well. My name is Yarrl, Ranger of Tunare and Kelethin.&quot; I
          bowed to them both and reached out my hand in friendship. &quot;Ah you
          are Yarrl. Well met my friend I have heard many a good thing about
          you. I am Furywrath from Kaladim&quot; Said the Dwarf and shook my
          hand. &quot;Yes…good things indeed….&quot; The Erudian said
          suspiciously. &quot;…. and I’m am Dracnor high regent to Odus. It
          is a…pleasure…… to meet you.&quot; Said Dracnor still
          embarrassed and mad at me for what I did. He would not shake my hand
          though. &quot;You speak Erudian very well for a elf.&quot; I pulled my
          hand back and again in perfect Erudian I said &quot;Thank you it was a
          difficult language to learn. No hard feelings Dracnor I was having
          some fun with you. Your elfish needs some work though I’d be more
          than happy to help you with it.&quot; He did not say anything but just
          gathered his items and backpack and pride together. About one hour
          later Denithor and Ryne arrived.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We arrived in Freeport that night and it was still
          busy. I do not like to travel to Freeport and try to avoid it as much
          as I can but it was unavoidable for this trip. It is a dirty city and
          always so chaotic. The five of us stopped in a tavern near the west
          gate to get the final supplies that we might need and to get a bite to
          eat and drink. I finished early and went outside to smoke and to
          think. &quot;You miss her do you?&quot; Denithor said as he came up
          behind me. &quot;I miss a lot of people.&quot; I said &quot;Yes I am
          sure that you do. Based on the letters that you sent me a lot has
          happened to you. Do you still have those dreams that made you leave
          Kunark?&quot; he asked. &quot;No, since that first night back in
          Greater Faydark and when I met Meassi I haven’t had those
          dreams.&quot; I said remembering the dream in my mind. &quot;Then that
          was the right thing to do. Yarrl you had the most wonderful vision
          when you were younger that most people would be envious of you for it.
          Tunare knows what’s best for you.&quot; He explained. &quot;Why then
          does she take everything away from me? She took my mother, father,
          sister, Zoberra, and Meassi.&quot; I said &quot;But that is where you
          are wrong. Did you not tell me that Tunare said that you would be
          forever with her chosen one for you? Well then if Meassi is the one
          that you think she is then you are destined to meet again. Have you
          heard anything about her?&quot; Denithor asked. &quot;No…..nothing.&quot;
          I said. Just then the others started to appear from the tavern.
          &quot;Well Yarrl don’t worry you shall meet again. Let this new land
          and new people that we are about to see take your mind off of the past
          and lets look ahead.&quot; Said Denithor. &quot;Ok everyone follow me
          I know the way.&quot; Ryne said as he stepped up to the gate with us.
          &quot;That is another reason why we were late to Kelethin. I’m not
          following you Ryne, you and your bloody shortcuts. I’m following
          Yarrl.&quot; Laughed Denithor. &quot;Look if it weren’t for that
          left at the Sarnak Fort we would have been fine.&quot; Explained Ryne.
          I just laughed and started to walk toward the Deserts of Northern Ro;
          I did remember the way.</p>

          <font SIZE="2">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We had to take a smaller boat to get to the island
          where the boat IceBreaker is located. This boat, the gnomes say, uses
          no sail and is faster than the Siren, I no doubt believe the Gnomes
          because they are always tinkering with new ideas but I’m sure it is
          a site to see. When we reached the dock we did see a site. We saw a
          large metal and wooden structure waiting for us. It had a wheel with
          very very large hammers in the air. The Gnomes said that is what will
          break the ice as we get close to our destination. This non-sail boat
          did not look like it could float. The Gnomes tried to explain to me
          how this worked but I did not understand. We got on and the wheel in
          the air with all the large hammers came down with a crash into the
          water and started to turn. Thick black smoke came from a smokestack in
          the middle of the boat and we started to move. The boat started off
          slow but started to move faster and faster. As we moved further south
          it started to get colder and ice burgs started to appear in the water.
          I was glad that I had brought my equipment for colder climates. When
          we arrived in Iceclad Denithor gave me the map that the king had given
          to him. It seemed that it would be about a 2 or 3 day journey.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We bought any last provisions that we might need
          and headed out. I was in the lead following the map and Ryne was next
          to me. Denithor and Dracnor were next while Furywrath watched the
          rear. The air was cold and the snow was up to my knees which made it a
          little difficult to walk through and the dwarfs were having a worse
          time than me, Ryne seemed ok since it was just Ankle deep for him.
          Dracnor told us to group around and he would help. He reached into his
          pocket and took an item out, he began chanting and waving his hands,
          the item turned to powder and he blew it at me. My feet suddenly
          lifted off the ground and I began to float. Being picked up by one’s
          feet for the first time and being surprised by it I lost my balance
          and fell. I did not hit the ground though. Dracnor and the others
          laughed at the expression on my face and at my clumsiness trying to
          get back up. Dracnor said back to me in Erudian &quot;Paybacks are
          hell right Yarrl?&quot; and he snickered some more. He did the same to
          the others in the group and as I soon learned I was the only one who
          has never done this before. I also realized when he finished that it
          was time to walk and everyone was looking at me ready to go. I looked
          a Dracnor and said &quot;How do you make it go?&quot; &quot;Make what
          go?&quot; he asked. &quot;Make me go.&quot; I said. He looked at me
          puzzled for a second and then smiled and said, &quot;Just start
          walking.&quot; I looked at him puzzled. All my life I have had
          something under my feet to walk on, how does one walk on air? I
          started to take these big huge steps like I was walking up stairs but
          my legs were wobbling and I fell. I must have been making some site
          because everyone was laughing at me. I asked Dracnor in Erudian
          &quot;Very funny. We are even now?&quot; &quot;Yes we are even …for
          now.&quot; He laughed. It is hard to step down in the middle of the
          air and expect my foot to stay there but even though it took about an
          hour I eventually did get the hang of it.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now that we were traveling over the snow it was
          easier to travel and we made good time. It was dusk now and the map
          indicated that there should be a bridge near by but we did not see
          one. I wanted to make it to the bridge and make camp there for the
          night. The bridge, according to the map, connected the island that we
          were on to the continent of Veliuos. We went over a hill and there it
          was. There was a huge dragon skeleton head in the sky and the backbone
          was the top of the bridge and the rib cage was holding the road as it
          went into the air. The bridge seemed to lift high into the air but it
          was getting dark and I could not see the other side. As we approached
          I suddenly noticed two figures at the bottom of the bridge near the
          road. They were giants that the Gnomes mentioned. Each had a sword,
          armor, boots, and helmet. These giants looked smarter than the ones in
          Kunark and even they are smarter than the ones back on Antonica.
          &quot;I think we ought to go back over the hill and make camp for the
          night away from these two. It is getting to dark and I would hate for
          one of us to get separated from the group.&quot; Everyone agreed to
          deal with them in the morning. &quot;Let’s start a fire.&quot; Asked
          Furywrath &quot;We should not start a fire since that will cause
          attention to be brought to us.&quot; I explained. They knew I was
          right but didn’t like it. &quot;I can try to help out.&quot; Said
          Dracnor. He chanted some words and for a brief moment the area around
          us glowed and then it started to feel comfortable, everyone started to
          relax and settle for the night.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next morning we got up and were ready to leave.
          I had noticed something here that caught my attention and that is how
          quite this place is. With the exception of the couple of cougars we
          have seen there has been no other person and all that can be heard is
          the crunching of the snow under our feet. On the boat on the way here
          Denithor had told us of the dealings with the Giants and the Gnomes
          and the hatred the Giants had for Dwarves. Because of this the Gnomes
          did not tell of the Dwarves that came from Kaladim to the Giants.
          Based on the map we had I was hoping that we would not have to deal
          with this as of yet, but as we approached the bridge the 2 guards were
          still there. It was a clear day and the sun was out and I had no
          doubts that the giants had already seen us. As we got to the base of
          the bridge one of the giants called out in a deep voice &quot;Halt,
          what business do you have here.&quot; Ryne spoke up &quot;Hail I am
          Ryne of Halas and have traveled here to explore this new land.&quot;
          The Giant replied, &quot;This land is not new, it is in fact very
          ancient. Ryne of Halas you look strange to me as do your
          friends.&quot; Ryne then asked, &quot;Did the Gnomes not tell you that
          others will come to seek adventure and to explore once word was out
          that this place was found?&quot; Then Ryne did mention something that
          was unavoidable. &quot;As you can see we even brought with us two
          Gnomes as guides to help us with our journey.&quot; I was nervous, the
          Giant did already see them and had been watching them carefully, the
          other one bent down to look closer at all of us. He looked at me and
          asked to see my ears, I did move my hair out of the way and he stared
          for a bit. &quot;These two do not look like the other Gnomes that have
          been here before. This one must be the one they called elves because
          of his pointed ears.&quot; He told the other Giant. The other Giant
          bent down and looked at both the Dwarves and me. &quot;What is that
          around your neck little one?&quot; He asked Denithor. When he said
          that I knew exactly what he was speaking of and that was the necklace
          of Brell that Denithor carried. As soon as he said this I placed my
          hand on the hilt of my sword to get ready incase something had
          happened. I also was upset at my self for not preparing the party
          before we set out with magical protection. When Denithor pulled out
          his necklace the Giant’s eyes got big and I could tell he knew what
          it was. He stood up and drew his sword and said angrily &quot;That is
          the symbol of Brell….the symbol of the Dwarves. Ryne of Halas you
          and your party are trying to deceive us by bringing into these lands
          the same creatures that we are trying to kill. You shall die for you
          actions today.&quot; And he swung his sword at Ryne while the other
          Giant moved to the Dwarves. I apparently was not the only one that had
          the same idea. Ryne was able to ready his weapons but the Giant was
          surprisingly fast and was able to hit him. I have been hit by Giants
          in the past and know that they hit hard and these Giants seemed much
          smarter and better trained than any I have seen before and they were
          most certainly well equipped. I moved over to the Giant that was going
          toward the dwarves and said the chant that was etched on the side of
          the sword and both of my weapons gleamed. Furywrath joined me and I
          heard Denithor in the back chanting. A rush of adrenaline surged
          through me, and my mind was clear and focused. Dracnor’s attention
          was on the Giant that struck Ryne and a fireball was gathering above
          him. The Giant swung his sword at Furywrath but he missed as Furywrath
          was to fast. I took this opportunity to move behind the Giant so that
          he would have to choose his target. Dracnor’s fireball was released
          and struck the Giant, he let out a roar and was enveloped in flames.
          Ryne recovered from his hit and placed one of his own onto the Giant
          while Dracnor prepared another fireball. The Giant that I was engaged
          with had his back to me since all of his hatred was focused on the
          dwarfs. I was able to repeatedly strike the Giant as he continued to
          strike at Furywrath. Furywrath was struck with such a blow it stunned
          him for a moment and the Giant was able to repeatedly hit him. I moved
          around and interposed between him and the Giant. While I was able to
          distract the Giant Denithor was able to heal Furywrath. The Giant was
          bleeding heavily now and was slowing down, he knew that this battle
          was lost and tried to make an escape. We could not let him get away to
          warn others of what we had done so I said &quot;By Tunare's
          hand!&quot; and the roots and grass from below the snow entwined
          around his feet. Furywrath and I continued to land blow after blow and
          the Giant finally fell. As we turned to help Ryne and Dracnor, Ryne
          place a crippling blow to the Giant and he fell to the ground dead.
          &quot;We will not be able to move these bodies so gather your items
          and lets put enough distance between us and them as we can.&quot; I
          said. &quot;Let us also this time get some additional protection for
          all of us.&quot; I continued. &quot;Aye that might be a good
          idea.&quot; said Denithor. Both he and I placed magical protection
          around us all and I also chanted for us to have the Spirit of the Wolf
          upon us. Dracnor again helped by making us float into the air. We then
          climbed the bridge.</p>

          <font SIZE="2">
          <font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we climbed the bridge and reached the top we
          could see below us the Eastern Wastes. This area reminded me of a snow
          covered West Karana, there were flat plains that gently turned in to
          rolling hills and Frozen trees that looked crystallized in ice, as we
          came down the bridge. The further west we went the rolling hills
          became steeper and would eventually turn into mountains. A large
          snowstorm came rolling in from the west and we could not see much in
          front of us. The wind was very cold and it was going through even the
          warmest of material I had with me from Halas. The rest of the party
          could feel it to so I decided to look for shelter and headed towards
          the hills to get out of the wind. There were more trees in the area
          that helped block the wind and I was able to find a large enough
          structure that would keep us protected for a while. From the look of
          the storm it might last awhile. As we sat there I started to smell
          something familiar but faint. With the wind blowing it wasn’t
          consistent and I couldn’t quite make it out so I dismissed it at
          first but it started to get a little stronger. It smelled like
          something similar to an Orc but was a little different. &quot;Do you
          all smell something?&quot; I asked. As I said that eight very large
          Orcs appeared around us. I could tell they were Orcs but these were
          larger than the ones I have dealt with before and….. were they
          wearing chain mail? Then something even stranger happened the one that
          appeared to be the leader spoke in a rough Dwarven voice. &quot;You
          are out numbered and surrounded come with us.&quot; I was completely
          surprised by this behavior. Not only did these Orcs speak but they had
          weapons and armor. They tied our hands behind our backs and led us to
          a fort. This was a large circular stone structure with a large room in
          the middle that housed a very large fire, on each side of the fire
          room two other rooms were connected to it and the entire fort was
          surrounded by a wall that was approx. 20 feet high. We were led to one
          of the rooms next to the fire room. In this room I could see three
          Orcs two of which were standing on a platform and the third one was in
          the middle on a higher platform. Glancing around I could see that
          there were stairs leading up to an area where two other Orcs stood
          above and behind us. There were thirteen Orcs and just five of us I
          was very nervous. &quot;I did not believe the reports from our scouts
          about the strangers in our land, lucky for them they were true. You
          two little ones look like Dwarves and I will turn you both over to the
          Kromrif and let them deal with you I’m sure they would like to ask
          you what happened at the bridge. But you…..&quot; he came over to
          look at me, &quot;What are you and why are you here?&quot; Then he
          inspected Ryne and Dracnor and asked them the same. Dracnor spoke
          &quot;We are explorers from a different land. I am Dracnor High
          Reagent of Odus and this is Ryne warrior of Halas, and that is Yarrl a
          Wood elf Ranger from Kelethin, and yes these two are Dwarfs from
          Kaladim.&quot;</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Orc spoke again &quot;I am Chief Ry’Gorr and
          I speak for my clan, the penalty for trespassing is death and so it
          shall be for you!&quot; Dracnor replied to the Chief &quot;That would
          not be a valid reason to kill us, we could be here in search for
          allies and have come to seek you out.&quot; The Chief laughed &quot;We
          have no need for weak bodied and minded people for allies.&quot;
          Dracnor replied in a very sarcastic tone of voice: &quot;Weak? In
          battle one of us could defeat three of you at once. Our death will
          only be a proof of your cowardly manners!&quot; I looked at Dracnor
          and didn’t believe my ears - didn’t he just mock the enemy who
          outnumbered us with at least four to one? He must have lost his mind!
          But the Chief replied growling: &quot;One of you against three of us?
          Hah, you pitiful creature. Let us see!&quot; He looked at us and
          quickly pointed me out as the weakest and gestured for three of his
          smelly companions to come closer. &quot;You now have a chance to prove
          it!&quot; The rope was cut from my hands and I was given my weapons
          back. The Orcs started yelling and cheering for the three of their own
          and it looked as if they were putting down bets on when I will die.
          The Chief yelled something in Orcish and they began to come at me. I
          was too busy watching the attackers to notice but the Chief was
          studying every move I made. The three Orcs were unsure of me and kept
          poking their swords at me halfheartedly testing to see how I would
          move. I repelled their simple test but did not go on the offence, the
          odds were against me and I was strictly going to be on the defense. I
          did not want any of the Orcs to get behind me since that would be too
          hard to defend. One of the Orcs charged me and the crowd started to
          cheer, but I had enough time to plant my foot and place the end of the
          Orc Impaler against it and the floor and set it for a charge. The Orc
          had no time to react because he was running to fast and went straight
          into it and then with my other hand I stabbed him with my sword. The
          room was quiet for a moment and then the betting and yelling started
          again. As I pulled the spear from the Orc the other two came at me at
          the same time. I was able to parry out of the way of one of them, but
          the other hit me hard on the shoulder with his hammer that sent a
          painfully cold shock through me. The third Orc was not dead yet but
          was slowly getting up and bleeding. I said the chant that was written
          on the side of the sword and both of my weapons gleamed. The two Orcs
          decided to come at me again at the same time but this time I was
          ready. The Orc with the hammer charged in with his hammer in the air.
          I blocked it with my Orc Impaler and stabbed him with the sword, the
          power from the sword exploded on him and pushed him back about 10
          feet. As I did that the other Orc took advantage of me with my arm in
          the air and stabbed me with his sword. The third Orc as weak and half
          standing as he could lunged at me and stabbed me in the shoulder with
          his dagger. The weight of this Orc was too much and we both fell on
          the ground and he landed on top of me. The dagger was in me deep and
          was very painful to pull out. While I was fighting, the Orcs in the
          crowd were all paying attention to me and the fighting not the others.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furywrath was able to free himself and work on the
          others. I was bleeding severely from my shoulder and waist and I knew
          that while on the ground I was prone and could not do anything. The
          crowd that was gathered was cheering. I was able to throw the Orc on
          top of me off but as I was trying to get up one of the other Orcs
          kicked me hard in the head and the other one kicked me in the gut
          where my wound was. I tried to gather my wits as best as I could and
          when he tried to kick me again in the head, I caught his foot and
          twisted it causing him to lose balance and fall. I was NOT going to
          let an Orc defeat me. I rolled out of the way of the other Orc and
          staggered to my feet. &quot;By the power of Tunare!&quot; I yelled out
          and threw out my hand and two of the three Orcs became tangled up and
          slowed.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I then felt a rush of adrenaline surge through me,
          as I knew Denithor was now free. I charged the Orc that was not
          tangled and swung as hard as I could and took off his head. The Orc I
          first wounded never got up after I threw him off so it was just him
          and me. All I had on me now was the sword and he had one to but he
          still had the advantage because he was unhurt, I was still bleeding
          and hurt and could barely stand. As we circled around an Orc from the
          crowd grabbed me and held me. As soon as I was grabbed the Orc I was
          fighting stabbed me with his sword and I fell to the ground. I knew
          that this was not going to be the end so with every ounce of strength
          I could muster I grabbed a fist full of dirt with one hand and any
          weapon I could grab with the second hand. When the Orc came over to me
          to finish his kill he grabbed me by my hair and pulled me up. I threw
          the dirt in his eyes blinding him and he let go to cover his eyes. I
          took the dagger that I had grabbed and put it right threw his armor
          and into his chest and he screamed to his death as I collapsed onto
          the floor.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Orcs in the crowd were yelling a cheering and
          settling their bets, again not paying attention to the others. As I
          hit the ground I suddenly felt rejuvenation and my wounds closed up
          and disappeared. I also felt another rush of adrenaline and heard
          Dracnor’s voice in Erudian say &quot;Everyone attack the Chief&quot;
          and as he said that he released a giant fireball centered on the Chief
          but enveloped not only him but the two Orcs on either side of him. I
          quickly grabbed my sword and my spear and made my way to him. The Orcs
          were stunned and confused at the events transpiring. In a
          uncontrollable rage I put my complete focus and attention onto the
          Chief and started to attack him. Ryne and Furywrath also started to
          attack him as well. It had seemed that with all the attention on the
          Chief and the others trying to save him none of the other Orcs in the
          room called for help, they immediately assisted the Chief. There were
          ten Orcs now in the room and we were outnumbered two to one. The Chief
          was a worthy opponent however he could not handle all three of us at
          once, he would be able to dodge two of us but the third would always
          hit. Ryne and Furywrath are better warriors than I am and although I
          am faster and can hit more frequently they both were able to place
          better and more effective hits on him than I was able to do. Another
          Fireball lit up the room and the Chief and the two others next to him
          again were enveloped in flames.</font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2" COLOR="#ff0000">
          </font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">Dracnor then chanted something
          and the strangest creature suddenly appeared in mid air. It was
          spotted like a frog, shaped like a triangle and it had no eyes, ears
          or legs. But it had arms and when Dracnor uttered a command in Erudite
          it moved the hands high in the air and more fireballs came flowing
          across the room to hit the Orcs.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chief started to run and the other two wanted
          to also but I snared them in place. Ryne and Furywrath moved in and
          killed the Chief as I snared the three of them and then they each
          attacked the injured Orcs. The other Elite guards fell quickly against
          the wrath of Ryne and Furywrath. While I was attacking the Chief I did
          have another Orc elite guard attack me from behind and now that the
          Chief was dead I could concentrate on him. &quot;By Tunare’s
          hand&quot; I yelled and I was able so snare him as I backed up out of
          his reach. While I was out of his reach I was able to concentrate for
          a moment and summon the energy within me to heal me a little bit. I
          was worn out from battle but continued to press on my attack. The Orc
          knew I was tired and was able to hit me a couple of times and started
          to come at me harder. All I could do was to stay on the defense and
          hope that Ryne or one of the others would be able to help.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Denithor was able to hold three of the four Orcs
          next to him in place and was attacking the forth while Dracnor showed
          his real power. Through the magic that he wielded, he had slain two of
          the three that were held in place. Furywrath dispatched with his and
          knew that I was in need of help and came to help me. They Elite guard
          knew that since he could not move he would have to continue.
          Considering me to be the weakest of us both he pressed his attack on
          Furywrath. After fighting four other Orcs and being so close to death
          I was tired and had no thought to my actions and felt weak. I was
          swinging wildly at the Orc with no direction or focus. Dracnor’s
          powerful magic killed the last Orc that was rooted and Ryne had killed
          his and was helping Denithor. Furywrath surprised the Orc by blocking
          his sword and then disarming him with the second one. He then smiled
          at the now defenseless Orc and put both swords through his heart. The
          last Orc was close to death and dropped his weapon and begged to be
          saved. Ryne and Denithor looked at me, and Denithor told him &quot;It
          is up to the one you wanted to kill first.&quot; I looked at the Orc
          and felt no pity I spit on him and drove my spear right through his
          heart.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dracnor said, &quot;Quickly now gather around me.
          With the lack of noise others will be here soon.&quot; He began to
          chant something I couldn’t quite understand and my eyes began to
          tingle. He then chanted a little more and said that we must hurry
          because although we are invisible it might not last long. As we
          crossed the main gate we could hear shouts and yelling from behind us
          where we were. After what seemed to be an hour later we finally
          stopped to rest for the night. The storm had now died down and we
          found a relative safe spot. &quot;Yarrl that was close I though I was
          not going to get to you in time.&quot; Said Denithor. &quot;Aye and
          how did you find the strength to continue on and fight two more? Very
          impressive.&quot; Said Furywrath. &quot;That little elf doesn’t look
          like much but he has something in him that won’t quite.&quot;
          laughed Ryne. I just smiled. I was too tired to do anything else.
          After a few moments I asked Dracnor, &quot;How did you know that by
          attacking the Chief they would not get help?&quot; Dracnor looked
          pleased with himself and said, &quot;I did not know that would happen,
          but in all my dealings with Orcs in the past they all act the same
          way. Yes these looked and acted more intelligent than any I have seen
          before but after all they are still Orcs.&quot; We all chuckled with
          what he said and then I went to sleep. That night I had the most
          wonderful dream of a forest full of trees but not like Kelethin and
          the creatures were friendly but I had never seen them before.</p>

          <font SIZE="2">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next morning we slept late because of the
          previous days events. The others must have covered my watch duties
          because I slept through the night. Based on the map I tried to guess
          where we were. The terrain was starting to get more mountainous so I
          knew we were going in the right direction. We again were floating
          above the snow so that we would not leave tracks. I did notice a large
          number of Ry‘Gorr Scouts along our path no doubt looking for us and
          as we continued west more Giant scouts as well. The map showed a Giant
          fort near the valley into what was called the Great Divide, which is
          were we were heading. I wanted to avoid that as much as I could so I
          started to go more northwest. It was now late in the afternoon and I
          stared to hear something I wasn’t expecting. Apparently the Orcs put
          me off course more so than I though and we were nearing the cliffs
          that drop into the ocean. Ryne noticed that I was looking at the map,
          sky and ground more than I normally do. I thought I was doing a better
          job of covering up the fact that we were lost more but I guess not.
          &quot;We are lost aren’t we?&quot; he said. I ignored him. After a
          few minutes he laughed &quot;Now I know we are lost he is ignoring
          me.&quot; I stared back at him angrily. Ryne continued jokingly
          &quot;The mighty Pathfinder Yarrl is lost we are doomed.&quot; Yes I
          was lost but I did have a general idea of where we were but I couldn’t
          let anyone know that I was lost so I tried to cover it as best as I
          could. &quot;Ryne this only continues to prove my theory that you
          Barbarians are to tall and the lack of oxygen to the brain way up
          there seems to affect your mind.&quot; Showing him the map I
          continued, &quot;Do you see this? That is the Great Divide. See that
          next to it? That is a Giant outpost. See that valley next to the Giant
          outpost? That is the valley to the Great Divide. See that?&quot; I
          pointed to a place along the cliff as to the north near to the valley.
          &quot;That is where we are at. Did you want me to walk next o the
          Giant outpost after our little run in two days ago? I didn’t think
          so.&quot; Ryne was quiet and Denithor was snickering at the both of
          us. Dracnor I could tell knew I was lying but said nothing but smiled.
          We decided to camp there for the night. I decided to take first watch
          and once the stars came out I was able to plot more precisely where we
          were on the map and as it turned out I was off by maybe half a day.
          When I went to sleep I had the same dream as the night before.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next morning I again awoke fresh and calm and
          well rested. The dream this time seemed more real to me and I was able
          to remember more of it. I could remember a pleasant calm of a forest
          and the creatures living in it. It almost felt like home. We packed up
          and headed out toward the southwest. It was a overcast day but no wind
          and snow to slow us down. The terrain was very jagged and more
          mountainous. Dracnor was running out of bat wings, his component that
          makes us float, and wanted to save that for a emergency. As we moved
          closer to the southwest Giant scouts became more and more frequent. I
          finally came across the valley that lead to the great divide, with all
          the Giants around we decided to take our time. At the end of the
          valley was a large hill our destination is just over the hill. When re
          reached the hill we looked down and could see a set of Wizard spires;
          I had never seen Dracnor so happy before. The map at this point ended.
          I continued to look around at the terran and the map. I was very
          confused. &quot;Denithor is this it? Is the Wizard spires the entrance
          to Thurgadin?&quot; I asked. &quot;No it is not is there nothing more
          on the map?&quot; he asked me. &quot;No this is it.&quot; I replied.
          Denithor took off his backpack and opened it up. He pulled out another
          map which included the location where were now to the city. &quot;I
          apologize for not giving this to you before or even telling you about
          it but you must understand that because of the hatred and war, the
          city is hidden from the Giants and the less that we know the longer it
          will be hidden. &quot; he explained. &quot;According to this new map
          we are very close to the city. We just need to continue West until we
          get to the river and follow it North to the city.&quot; I said. As we
          went over the last hill we could see the river in front of us and to
          the north was a great mountain range with a waterfall that was feeding
          the river in front of us. The river flowed from near the top of the
          cliff down to another level and then off of another cliff down to
          where we were.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We started to walk north toward the waterfall when
          behind a snow mound a guard spoke in Dwarven. &quot;Stop! Who and what
          are thee.&quot; Denithor came up to the front of the group. &quot;Hail
          and well met brother. I am Denithor and this is Furywrath and we are
          from Kaladim.&quot; Denithor then took off his backpack and pulled out
          a insignia from the King of Thurgadin that the king gave to the Gnomes
          to give to the Dwarfs of Kaladim. The guard, or wolfmaster as they are
          called, smiled and bowed and said &quot;Hail and well met Denithor and
          Furywrath and companions, we have been waiting for this day please
          follow me.&quot; He led us to the waterfall and amazingly enough the
          kingdom was behind the waterfall and it was carved out of ice and
          stone inside the mountain. As we walked down the hallway people
          stopped what they were doing and came out of their shops to look at us
          and whispered to each other. When we reached the throne room the King
          was waiting for us, it seems that he was informed of our arrival
          already. &quot;Hail travelers and welcome to Thurgadin!&quot; he said.
          We all genuflected in front of him. &quot;Please rise, I am XXXX king
          of the Dwarves of Thurgadin.&quot; Denithor replied &quot;Well met
          good king I am Denithor and this is Furywrath of Kaladim….&quot; As
          he said that the people in the room whispered among themselves &quot;……The
          two sons of Brell are now united!!!&quot; and everyone in the room
          cheered. &quot;Who now are the rest of you companions Denithor?&quot;
          said the king. Dracnor stepped up and bowed very low and stately to
          the king, &quot;Well met M’lord. I am Dracnor High Reagent of Odus,
          I send greeting to you from our council and offer my services to
          you,&quot; Ryne then stepped up and he to bowed but not as stately as
          Dracnor. &quot;Hail and well met M’lord, I am Ryne and I also bring
          greeting from the clans of the Barbarian peoples.&quot; Then the king
          looked at me. I also bowed as stately as I could, &quot;Hail and well
          met good king, I am Yarrl and I bring greetings from the kingdoms of
          the elves.&quot; The king smiled at us all and said &quot;You all must
          be tired from you journey, please get rested and tonight we shall
          celebrate!!&quot; and cheering filled the room.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That night a large banquet was prepared with
          dancing and drinking and storytelling. If anything about the dwarfs
          are the same it is the alcohol. Their ales and beers and liquor’s
          are as potent and pleasing to the taste as in Kaladim. The King
          proposed a toast and then wanted to meet with his councilors and all
          of his advisors. He asked for Denithor and Furywrath to join him. The
          party continued while the meeting was going on I was getting the
          strangest stares from some of the ladies and the men were teasing me
          thinking I was thin and weak. I could only assure them I was not. I
          danced with the ladies and told tales of the other places I have been
          I also told them of the trees of Kelethin and how we live in them.
          They did not believe me and laughed. I also arm wrestled some of the
          men that challenged me so they could see I was not weak I won the
          first match and the last match but lost I lost the three in-between
          along with some money. As I was enjoying myself the King was watching
          me along with the others. I was not paying attention but he was
          meeting with everyone as the party went on and I was the last. As I
          finished the last match the king’s advisor came over to get me.
          &quot;Yarrl the King would like to see you now please.&quot; He said.
          I gathered my backpack and went into the room. I bowed before the king
          as stately as I could. &quot;Thank you Yarrl, please be seated. The
          reason I asked you here is to learn more about you as I have done with
          the others. You told me earlier that you speak for the kingdoms of the
          elves, is there more than one?&quot; I then proceed to tell the king
          of the story of the Felwithe Elves and of the Kelethin Elves and I
          also told him of the Dark Elves and how they came into being. He also
          was in disbelief that we live in the treetops. &quot;I do also bring a
          gift from my people to you.&quot; I said remembering the package that
          Maesyn placed into my backpack. I took out a small wooden box that had
          the symbol of Kelethin carved onto it. I did not even know what was in
          the box but I gave it to the King and he opened it. As soon as he
          opened it I knew exactly what it was. The King did not know what it
          was but his advisor asked to look at it. &quot;Is this what I think it
          is Yarrl? Are these two seeds from the tree of remembrance? Ancient
          writings say that the tree of remembrance was the first tree planted
          by Tunare herself which created the forest’s of Norrath.&quot; I
          looked at him surprised and said &quot;Yes it is. Those are Kelethin's
          greatest treasures. How did you know?&quot; The kings advisor said to
          the king &quot;Ancient legions from the Wakening Lands speak of this
          seed M’lord. It is a great gift, however I believe that Yarrl needs
          to take one of them back to the Wakening Lands.&quot; The King agreed
          with his advisor. &quot;Yarrl in honor of this gift I will repay your
          kindness with this suit of armor. It was made by the Blacksmith of Ry’Gorr
          but it is exceptional. I also give you back one of you seeds and tell
          you to take it to the Wakening Lands they will be anxious to see
          it.&quot;&quot; I bowed again to the king and asked him, &quot;What
          are the Wakening Lands?&quot; He thought I already knew. &quot;Have
          you never heard of the Wakening Lands? It is said in the ancient tombs
          that Vishnu created this world here where we are and the other gods
          did as well. The Wakening Lands, it is said in those ancient writings,
          were created by Tunare herself. I can give you maps and help if you
          wish.&quot; I was surprised at what the king had said. I had never
          heard of this land before and wanted to see it. &quot;That is most
          kind of you M’lord. Might that explain the strange dreams I have had
          since I have come to this land?&quot; I asked. &quot;What strange
          dreams have they been?&quot; the advisor asked. I then described to
          them the land and the creatures that I could remember along with the
          peacefulness and calmness I feel when I wake up. &quot;Yes that sound
          very much like the Wakening Lands Yarrl you must go and find why you
          are being called there.&quot; I then was dismissed by the King and
          bowed and took my leave. I did not return to the banquet I instead
          went to the room I was given and wrote the weeks events in my journal
          and updated the map with the new things we have seen. I then went to
          sleep and had dreams of the Wakening Lands.</p>

          <font SIZE="2">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the next several weeks we stayed based out of
          Thurgadin and surveyed the surrounding areas. Ryne, Furywrath, and
          myself explored the areas and made maps and I wrote in my journal.
          Since mail has not been set up from here it will have to wait till I
          get back to Freeport. Denithor and Dracnor had full access to the
          library and stayed in there studying for the most part. My desire to
          go to the Wakening lands grew with each day and after the second month
          I decided to go. Furywrath, Ryne, and Denithor wanted to come along.
          Dracnor still wanted to research in the library. The King did what he
          promised and gave us very good maps and supplies and equipment. It
          took three days for us to get to the Wakening Land. Once we entered
          the valley it looked as if it was right out of my dreams. There were
          beautiful trees and shrubs and a clam over the forest. I could not
          explain it but I had an overwhelming desire to go in a particular
          direction. I put the maps away and started to follow that desire. As
          the day got longer the desire became stronger. Furywrath, Ryne, and
          Denithor followed along. We soon reached a lake and there was a
          circular tower building about 4 stories high on the bank. As I walked
          up to the building a creature I had never seen before was coming out
          of it. We both stopped and looked at each other, he then came over and
          said, &quot;You are a wood elf am I right?&quot; I said &quot;Yes I
          am.&quot; He then went on to say, &quot;You are a wood elf from
          Fadwyer. Your kind has not been seen here in many many ages. The
          mother said that someday you shall return.&quot; He then looked at my
          companions &quot;Hmmmm you two are Dwarfs but not of the Coldain has
          the day already come that the son’s of Brell have met?&quot;
          Furywrath said, &quot;Aye it has.&quot; Before he could continue the
          creature looked at Ryne and said, &quot;You are a Barbarian from the
          clans of the far north correct? Your kind has never been seen here
          before.&quot; Ryne said, &quot;Yes I am.&quot; but the creature again
          continued &quot;yes…yes..indeed very tall….my my where does the
          time go……..Welcome all to my fiefdom. I am Duke Shamus Aghllsews
          of the Tunarean Court. I am the guardian of this world to the next.
          Come with me we must see the others.&quot; Shamus led us inside the
          building. It was rather plan on the inside and had stairs attached to
          the walls leading up to the next floor.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Shamus appeared at the top of the stairs and asked
          for us to come up to him. When reached the next level it again was
          very plan and looked like the first floor however there was a table
          along the other side of the room and Shamus was at the center and
          three others on either side of him. &quot;Please come forward and
          introduce yourselves.&quot; One of them said. The others went ahead
          and introduced themselves. &quot;The sons of Brell have met. That
          circle is now complete. Now young wood elf who are you?&quot; I
          stepped up and said, &quot;I am Yarrl from the city of Kelethin of
          Greater Faydark. I speak for the elves and pledge friendship and offer
          you a gift.&quot; I then presented the seed to Shamus. &quot;The seed
          from the tree of remembrance. Tunare will be pleased to see that. She
          has foretold of your coming here. Now it is time for the children of
          Tunare to unite and our circle on this world is complete.&quot; He
          said. Then one of the others spoke; she was a beautiful woodnymph
          woman. &quot;Hail Yarrl I am Eysa Florawhisper, Yarrl you have served
          Tunare well and she wishes to reward you and your companions for your
          service. You have all proven yourself to be worthy and have been
          granted citizenship of our kingdom, and for you Yarrl, Tunare wishes
          you to have this.&quot; She placed her hand out and in the palm is a
          silver ring. &quot;This is the Tunarean Signet Ring, only those truly
          worthy receive such a ring.&quot; I thanked her and bowed and placed
          it on my finger and immediately felt more confident.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A woodnymph came into the room and whispered into
          Shamus’s ear. &quot;The Kromrif and Kromzek are back and are
          persistent in their efforts to expand Kael into the forest of Tunare,
          they are a threat to all houses of the Tunarean Court.&quot; He said.
          &quot;We shall investigate this for you Shamus.&quot; I said. &quot;We
          here on the court would appreciate that. It is late though so rest
          tonight the kingdom is yours I must take my leave now.&quot; He and
          the rest of the court took the seed and headed up the stairs. For the
          rest of the day we relaxed and I even went for a swim in the lake. The
          next morning I felt relaxed and fresh and was ready to go, I must have
          had a good night sleep finally for once I thought to myself. Ryne,
          Furywrath, and Denithor looked relaxed and fresh as well. Eysa was
          there waiting for us and had a smile on her face when she saw me.
          &quot;Here Yarrl is the general area of where the Giants are building.
          May Tunare watch over and protect you.&quot; For the next two months
          the four of us stayed out in the forest and did what we could to halt
          the construction of the Kael outpost. We were successful in the
          halting of the construction but it is just a matter of time when they
          will be back with more forces. Shamus is well aware of this and hopes
          that we can spread the word to come and help the Wakening Lands. It
          was time to head back. I needed to take care of unfinished business in
          Crushbone that I felt I was ready to do. Over the last two months I
          have discussed several times at length with Eysa about my vision,
          Meassi, and Lord Darish. She also believes that it is time to go back
          and fulfill part of my destiny. She has been a true friend over these
          last two month and I can’t explain it but I do feel very close to
          her. I told that I would come back when I can sometime. It took us
          three days to get back to Thurgadin and when we got there we took our
          leave from the King and his people. Dracnor was thankful of all the
          time for the library and we headed back to the dock where Icebreaker
          was waiting.</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we arrived at the port there were people
          waiting. They were not for us but for the boat. Once we have returned
          the boat was to be opened for traveling. I was relieved to get back to
          North Ro. By the looks of everyone it seemed that we all were glad to
          be here. &quot;I am going to stay in Freeport for a day or two to
          relax before I journey back to Greater Faydark.&quot; I said. Denithor
          replied, &quot;Furywrath and I need to go to the king and report our
          information. Yarrl Give me your maps and journals and I will get them
          on to Kelethin.&quot; I handed him my information, which now that it
          is all together and in one stack I noticed was quite a lot. I’m was
          sure that it would keep Maesyn busy for a very long time going through
          it all. Dracnor took his leave of us and went on to find a way to Odus.
          Ryne also had a long journey ahead of him and wanted to rest for a
          little bit also. &quot;Yarrl, I know that you hate Freeport so I’ll
          come along to keep you out of trouble.&quot; He said. &quot;Hmmm…you
          and me in Freeport alone without Denithor to break us up? Let’s just
          hope that the guards are ready for us.&quot; I laughed.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It didn’t take long to travel through North Ro
          and then East commons before we got to the South Gate of Freeport. It
          seems that Denithor and Furywrath had already been here and had gotten
          on the boat and left because there was a small crowd of young people
          waiting for us at the gate and wanted to know of our travels to the
          New World. That night Ryne and I went to our favorite pub in town to
          have a good time. There was a big crowd in there but we were able to
          find a table. The waitress came over and said, &quot;The barkeep says
          the drinks are on the house tonight courtesy of a local patron.&quot;
          I smiled to her and ordered an elvan wine to start with. Not long
          after we ordered we were joined by an unusual person. &quot;May I sit
          with you good sirs?&quot; he said. Ryne didn’t seem to mind so I
          said, &quot;Aye, you may. Is there some business we can help you
          with?&quot; He started, &quot;Everyone in town has been waiting for
          you all to get back so that traveling could open. I however wanted to
          talk to you first. My name is Clef and I want to hear all about your
          travels and encounters and all the details, with your permission of
          course.&quot; Ryne replied, &quot;Why do you want to know our
          business?&quot; Clef said, &quot;I am, good sir, a entertainer, a
          storyteller, and a minstrel and the stories around here are….. lets
          say ….old. You however have just come back from a place where no one
          has been before and have seen things no one here has seen before and
          in my business that means job security.&quot; He laughed.
          &quot;Forgive my big friend here, Barbarians have those thick skulls
          you know. Ok Clef I agree besides I’m sure you would want a full
          detailed account of our actions, if Ryne explains it to you it will be
          to short and do you no good, but I have two conditions. First you
          leave us alone tonight since this is our first nigh back, and second
          you have to provide me with news from the last couple of months.
          Deal?&quot; I asked. &quot;Ok, deal.&quot; Clef said. Then Ryne
          decided that he better add events to it also because he didn’t want
          me to get all the glory. For the next several hours Clef made sure
          that the drinks kept coming and that we were left alone.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the next three days Clef met us in the pub and
          we spent several hours telling him of our journey. I was surprised at
          all his questions that he had and all the exact details and our
          emotions and feelings about the places and people we had seen. He also
          kept up with his part of the deal and informed us of news from here
          and from Halas and Kelethin. &quot;I apologize my information on
          Kelethin is not as detailed as the rest Yarrl. My roommate is very sad
          and when I bring up that city it seems to make things worse. The poor
          girl was banned from there.&quot; He said. As soon as he said banned I
          practically jumped out of my seat &quot;MEASSI?&quot; I asked.
          &quot;Yes it is her.&quot; He said and looked surprised that I knew
          her. &quot;Take me to her now!&quot; I ordered. &quot;I can not. She
          is not here at the moment. She leaves the city and comes back
          sometimes days or weeks later. I wish she would stay here but she is
          off again.&quot; I calmed back down and took my seat again. &quot;Tell
          me everything you know about her….please.&quot; I said desperately.
          He had then told me everything that has happened to her over the last
          couple of years. I was hurt by all the news and Clef has a way with
          telling stories and it was a very sad story. &quot;Clef, you have kept
          your part of the bargain and I have done mine. You sir are an
          honorable bard and a gifted storyteller but I do have I last request.
          I am leaving to Kelethin tomorrow and since you do not know when
          Meassi will return may I leave a letter with you to give to her?&quot;
          I asked. &quot;Aye, I can do that for you.&quot; He said. I wrote:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>&quot;My dear Meassi!</i></p>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>It has reached my ears that you are in
            Freeport and killing Orcs there – what joy it was to find out that
            you have not lost your fighting spirit or your hate for these foul
            creatures.</i></p>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>I have recovered fully from my battle with the
            Orcs a long time ago and have been fighting them as often as I
            could. I know you have turned 15 now and congratulations on that.</i></p>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>I hope that you will reconsider coming here
            and aiding me in my battle against our foes. Maesyn has told me your
            story and I believe we have a sad background in common Meassi – I
            too lost my parents in The Big War 13 years ago!</i></p>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>Yarrl</i></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I sealed the letter and gave it to Clef. I then
          took my leave of him and took the next boat back to Faydwar toward
          home. Clef’s story of Meassi was very sad and I prayed to Tunare and
          asked her to release Meassi from that path of hurt.</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It didn’t take me
          long to get back home from Freeport. On my way to the dock I happened
          to bump into a friend that I had not seen in a long time. When I was
          helping Maesyn with his class she was one of his students. I had been
          gone for such a long time I didn’t even recognize her for now she
          has grown up into a woman. &quot;Hail Yarrl, don’t you recognize
          me?&quot; Auriea asked. I looked at her and said, &quot;I am sorry M’Lady
          but I have been away for a very long time I do not recognize you.
          Should I?&quot; I was trying to remember but I couldn’t. &quot;It is
          me Auriea. You taught me how to make and read maps with Maesyn in his
          classes.&quot; I looked at her shocked &quot;Auriea that is you?
          Please forgive me but you have grown up...have I been away that
          long?&quot; I then bowed very stately. I did now remember who she is,
          she is a protector of the forest, a Druid and a very gifted one as
          well. Maesyn would comment on her to me about how quickly she learns.
          &quot;How long has it been since you have gotten back?&quot; she
          asked. &quot;I have just gotten back a couple of days ago, I am on my
          way to the dock to get the boat back to Faydwar.&quot; I answered.
          &quot;The Boat? Let me help you, I’ll take you back much faster than
          the boat. Here grab my hand.&quot; She then held out her hand and I
          took it. She started to chant and a large shimmering circle appeared
          next to us. She smiled at me and said to go in it. I stepped into it
          and as I placed my foot on the ground I was somewhere else. I was no
          longer in the city. &quot;Here you go. This is the closest I can get
          you to home.&quot; &quot;Where are we?&quot; I asked. &quot;We are in
          Butcher Block silly.&quot; she answered. &quot;You have mastered
          Teleportation?&quot; &quot;Well I haven’t mastered it but I am still
          learning.&quot; she smiled. &quot;I must go now Yarrl. It was good to
          see you again.&quot; Then she said the same chant backwards and she
          was gone.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was good to be
          home again. I decided to stay with Bryn for a few days in Lesser
          Faydark before heading off to Kelethin. I was only there for one day
          however before Measyn decided to come for a visit. &quot;Yarrl, I have
          heard rumors that you were back. Why did you not come to the city? We
          received a messenger with all your journals and maps, and the
          historians and council are going them still. We are all waiting to
          here from you.&quot; He said. I was still a little tired but I was
          glad to be home and I explained, &quot;I apologize Measyn but I have
          been gone long and I wanted to rest some, but of course I can travel
          back with you to talk to the council.&quot; He told me to rest today
          and we will meet tomorrow. The next day I appeared in front of the
          council and along with the council King Tormax of Felwithe was there
          with his daughter Ferionia Fie, I kneeled before them and was glad to
          see Ferionia back home. &quot;I hear that you were one of the people
          looking for me in Kunark before you were called back. Many thanks
          Yarrl for your help.&quot; She said. &quot;I am glad that you are home
          M’Lady, you honor me by being here.&quot; I said. I told my story
          and answered all their questions to the best of my ability. They were
          very interested in the Wakenlands and the ring that I was given from
          Tunare. Ferionia also had questions about the Ring of Scale. I told
          her what could but my information was limited.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I spent the next month going over my journeys and
          maps to Measyn and his class. On my off time I spent most of it
          scouting the Orcs and Crushbone. The raids with the Orcs are still
          going on there is no end in site, but the time has come for me to take
          my revenge on Lord Darish. For the next several weeks I scouted the
          area at night all around the castle. I got to know there guard changes
          and when they took place and when would be the best opportunity to go
          in. One night while I was watching a wagon of supplies came up to the
          castle. I saw Lord Darish appear out of the castle and I started to
          slowly get my bow out. Behind him however I saw a Tier’dal appear I
          immediately stopped. What was he doing here and who is he? I decided
          to get as close as I could and listen. I don’t understand much of
          Orcish or Dark Elfish but I tried to get as much as I could. The Tier’dal
          was twerling his dagger in his hand when he stopped and placed it on
          the ledge of the wall next to me and helped unload some of the
          supplies. I grabbed it and then moved silently away and back to
          Kelethin. That morning I went to Measyn and reported what I had seen
          and shown him the dagger. &quot;What were you doing there Yarrl !! You
          know it is forbidden to go there. Don’t you remember what happened
          last time? We cannot afford to have a full scale war with them.&quot;
          He said. &quot;Measyn the time has come for me to take my revenge on
          Lord Darish ! I will kill him with or with out the permission of the
          council, you can either be with me or against me but it will be
          done!&quot; I argued back at him. &quot;Yarrl, I understand your
          reasons for this but this is not the right time. The Dark Elf you have
          seen is Dv’inn. Meassi’s father, Villarain, served Kelethin very
          well long ago and was the first to discover the connection between the
          Tier’dals and the Orcs. He paid for that information with his life
          the same day that your father died. If you kill Lord Darnish not only
          will you endanger Kelethin with the Orcs but also with the Tier’dals,
          are you willing to jeopardize Kelethin for revenge?&quot; he asked. I
          though about it but the more I thought the more I knew it was time and
          that I would be alone. &quot;Measyn, I will take my revenge on him
          soon, I can promise you that.&quot; I warned him. &quot;Yarrl, I can
          get you the support of the council but you will have to do it
          alone.&quot; I left his room.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That evening I was still upset that Measyn would
          not let me have some help that I needed, when I saw a crowd at the
          lift. I heard Measyn speaking to someone but I could not make out who
          it was. I tried to look down but it was getting dark so I couldn’t
          see what was going on. I then heard one of the children yell down
          &quot;Meassi – you’re a follower of Innoruuk!&quot; Meassi?!
          Here?! I ran to one of the other lifts but by the time I had gotten to
          where she was she was gone. I started to look for her but it was
          difficult, with all the people that walk near the lift all day long,
          trying to track something is difficult. I went toward the old ruins
          near the city and noticed a campfire light. I wasn’t sure if it was
          her or not so I decided to take my time and sneak up, but as I got
          closer I could tell it was her. And she looked more Beautiful than
          ever. &quot;Meassi! Good to see you again!&quot; I said smiling
          because I was happy to see her again. I sat down by the fire. &quot;I
          heard tales of you in Freeport. It seems you have been tried by both
          Tunare and your people and also yourself. I watched your encounter
          with Measyn from the platform and I was glad to see that you haven’t
          lost your fierceness.&quot; I snickered. She looked at me angrily
          &quot;Do you find my destiny funny? Does it amuse you to see everyone
          turn their back on me?&quot; She looked very upset. &quot;I’m sorry.
          That came out the wrong way…I didn’t mean to be insensitive. I do
          not find it funny. I’m just happy that you have returned and that
          all that has been seems unimportant to me.&quot; I tried to explain
          but in my joy to see her again I just wasn’t making any sense.
          &quot;Well, since I at this very moment have no one, it doesn’t seem
          quite so unimportant to me!&quot; she said. &quot;Well, it seems I can’t
          speak any sense at all right now, so I’ll be quiet and just enjoy
          that fact that you are back. Do you want to tell me about your
          adventure?&quot; I asked. She was quiet for a min and then asked me.
          &quot;Why Yarrl did you write me and why do you not like the rest see
          me as an abomination?&quot; I sat there thinking at the path she was
          on, and how low her self-esteem is. It is time for that path to be
          over. Seeing her there sitting in front fills me with emotions that I
          have not felt in a long time. ‘Should I tell her of my visions?’ I
          asked myself. I decided not to. &quot;You are a good fighter Meassi
          and in time you will get better.&quot; I could see that she was cold.
          &quot;Are you cold?&quot; As I said that I got up and took off my
          cloak and wrapped her in it.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I felt awkward about what I had said and a little
          uncomfortable so I took out my Fletching kit and started to make some
          shafts. It made me feel more at ease to do something I was familiar
          with. As I was making some shafts I could hear her sobbing a little. I
          didn’t know what to do but I could remember what my mother would do
          and that always made me feel good so I got up and wrapped my arms
          around her and pulled her close. I started to rock her and hold her
          tight. I wanted to take all her past pain away from her. I wanted to
          be with her to help her feel better. As I rocked her she started to
          cry louder and she couldn’t hold back anymore. She was crying and
          shaking all over, we sat there for a long time until she stopped. I
          slowly and carefully let go, worried for her. &quot;Do you feel
          better?&quot; I smiled to her. &quot;Yes….thank you…much
          better.&quot; She said. I wanted to get this behind us so I wanted to
          change the subject. &quot;Good! Now we should get some sleep because
          we have much to do tomorrow!&quot; &quot;What? What are your
          plans?&quot; As she asked I went to get some wood for the fire since
          she was cold and she also looked tired so I gathered some moss. I made
          a pillow out of the moss and asked her to lie down to try it out. I
          could see that she was tired and her eyes were closing. I said a small
          chant and surrounded her with camouflage for the night.</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next morning I went to go get us something to
          eat. I found a rabbit scurrying around and was able to shoot it with
          an arrow. I was on my way back to the camp when I could see some
          figures near the camp. There was a light fog so I couldn’t make out
          what they were but the smell was giving them away. One of the Orcs was
          just about at the campsite and was looking at the area near Meassi. I
          pulled my bow and grabbed an arrow. I knocked the arrow and took
          careful aim. I then released it, and it hissed in the air. The Orc
          heard it and looked up and as he did that it struck him dead center in
          the chest and he fell dead. The other Orc immediately started to run.
          I was about to shoot it but luckily I did not because Meassi appeared
          up and started to run after it. I moved some and re aimed, then
          released. The arrow found it’s mark and stuck in his back. I quickly
          got another one ready and as the Orc reached for his sword I released
          it. The arrow sped through the air and struck the Orc in the neck and
          it fell dead as Meassi got close enough to engage. &quot;It’s not
          that I didn’t think you could kill them but I kill them on
          reflex.&quot; She smiled at me and said, &quot;Well, good morning to
          you too!&quot; I smiled back and together we searched the bodies for
          cash and dragged them away from the campsite. As I was cooking the
          rabbit Meassi was rolling up the blankets &quot;Thank you for the Bear
          pelt last night Yarrl, but where did you get it? There are no bears in
          this part of the forest.&quot; She asked. &quot;I..uhmm…traded it
          for some things in my backpack.&quot; We continued to talk about the
          last three years that we had not seen each other. She told me all the
          details of what she went through, it was very sad. I wanted to tell
          her that I knew and that I couldn’t help but I decided not to say
          anything about it. She started to talk about the letter that I sent
          and how that was her turning point. She asked me, &quot;What do you
          mean when you said ‘We have a sad background together’?&quot; I
          smiled at her, it was late morning already and we still had work to do
          so I said, &quot;Aah, let’s save that for some other day. We have
          work to do!&quot; She looked at me with one of her eyebrows raised. I
          said, &quot;We are going Lord Darish!&quot;</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She looked at me shocked and almost laughed but
          could see that I was serious. &quot;But first we have to train
          together so we both get to know our strengths and weakness.&quot; I
          stood up and stuck the rabbit pelt onto the tree next to us with a
          dagger. &quot;You are not kidding? Are you insane Tunare man?! We can
          not kill Lord Darish with just the two of us!&quot; she said in
          disbelief. &quot;Yes we can ..trust me. I have spent some time
          sneaking around the castle and I have a plan. Now kill that rabbit
          pelt!&quot; I replied. She just stood there in disbelief looking at me
          and said, &quot;Yarrl for Tunare’s sake! We will both get killed
          trying and Kelethin will suffer the wrath of Crushbone! You must be
          mad!&quot; I knew my plan would work and I knew that Tunare was with
          me and I knew she had nothing else to lose so I grabbed hold of her
          shoulders and looked her straight in the eyes and said, &quot;Meassi,
          you have lost everything. You can be one of the greatest fighters of
          all time but you have to prove yourself to your people, Maesyn, and
          even to yourself and regain the trust that you once had. There is
          nothing to worry about, Lord Darish WILL die and you and I shall be
          the ones that kill him.&quot; &quot;But…&quot; she tried to say.
          &quot;But nothing. Trust me. Now kill that pelt!&quot; She stood there
          for a min and looked at me and then at the pelt and them back at me as
          if she was in agreement. She then looked at the pelt grabbed it and
          was about to stab it when I grabbed her arm. I told myself in Velious
          that I would never do it again and to this day I still make sure that
          I am prepared before any battle. &quot;Aren’t you forgetting
          something?&quot; She didn’t understanding what I was asking her.
          &quot;Always check to see that you and your group are prepared and
          protected before battle. Sometimes you do not have time for that, but
          when you do…do it.&quot; I continued. &quot;It’s a rabbit pelt
          Yarrl.&quot; She said. &quot;Are you sure it is just a rabbit pelt? I
          have seen spiders that cast magic of their own, ghost’s that can
          charm the living, and pools of goo that come alive. Don’t let anyone
          trick you into thinking that evil things that roam our great world are
          always what they seem to be.&quot; She looked annoyed with me but she
          learning. She chanted to her self and asked if I was ready and then
          charged the tree blindly and almost cut the pelt in half. She turned
          around very proud of herself but I had already fallen to the ground
          faking death. She hurried over and looked concerned at me. &quot;Are
          you ok? What happened?&quot; I sat up and looked a little disappointed
          at her. &quot;I got killed because you were fighting with your back to
          me and did not see me getting attacked.&quot; She looked at me annoyed
          now and said, &quot;You are getting annoying, do you know that?…and
          you have grass in your hair…it looks funny even if you ARE
          dead.&quot; She started to laugh at me. I just grinned back at her and
          very quickly pushed her down, grabbed some grass and started to rub it
          in her hair. We were both laughing at each other and telling each
          other to stop. After I got enough grass in her hair I stood up still
          giggling and offered her my hand to help her up she grabbed it and
          started to get up. A grin suddenly appeared on her face and before I
          knew what was going on she put one foot on my stomach and threw me
          over her onto the ground. She started to laugh at me and I must admit
          it was funny and I was laughing also and soon we were rolling on the
          ground play fighting and laughing.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the next month we trained together in the
          forest and if any Orcs came to close to our campsite we would practice
          on it. Meassi was amazing. She is such a quick learner and not only
          can she understand what I am trying to do but she can improve on it as
          well and teach me a thing or two. Together we make a good team each
          knowing what the other was doing and can make adjustments to match. In
          the evenings we talked about all the things that were going on in
          Norrath, we talked history, and I told her of some of the places and
          people that I have seen. I told her hold I grew up in Kelethin and
          attended class with Maesyn after my parents were killed.</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the nights while Meassi would sleep I would
          continue my observing and watching the Orcs in Crushbone. I did
          discover that even on my limited understanding of Orcish I could tell
          a hatred between the Orcs and the Tier’dal. I was going to use this
          to my advantage. The time has come to put my plan into action. I
          returned back to the campsite to get some sleep. The next morning at
          breakfast I took out a map that I had made of Crushbone. &quot;Here is
          the entrance&quot; I explained. &quot;and there are normally four Orcs
          guarding this area. We do not have to kill them, we will just sneak
          by. At the castle there are normally four to six legionnaires guarding
          along with a Oracle there as back up.&quot; As I said that a memory
          flashed in my head about the last time she had seen that Oracle. I
          continued, &quot;We will camouflage and sneak them as well and pray
          they don’t see us. Once inside the castle we will go to the throne
          room. We should find him there, I don’t know for sure though because
          I have never been in there, but I’m guessing that he has a few
          emissaries in there with him as well as another Oracle. We have to
          ignore them though and go straight for Darish because if we start with
          the emissaries then Darish will call for help. But if we start with
          Darish the Orcs will be so busy trying to defend him they will forget
          to call for reinforcements. When he is dead I will get them to
          concentrate their attacks on me so that you can cast snare on them to
          prevent them from running. You can cast snare right?&quot; I asked.
          &quot;Good, then if we succeed, I will place this in Darish’s
          back,&quot; I showed her the Dragoon dagger, &quot;and camouflage,
          sneak back out and be gone when they discover the bodies.&quot; &quot;Sheesh
          Yarrl, you make it sound so easy.&quot; She said. I explained,
          &quot;It won’t be easy. Far from easy and it is of great importance
          that you do not attack anything before you have snared them all.
          ok?&quot; She smiled and said, &quot;Yessir!&quot; and clicked her
          heels and saluted me. &quot;Meassi please! This is not a game!&quot; I
          knew that she was just trying to make me smile but I wanted to make
          sure this worked. &quot;No, I know….sorry&quot; she said. &quot;We
          will go tomorrow morning very early.&quot; We went over the plan four
          more times to make sure we were clear on what to do and what to do if
          things went wrong. We spent the rest of the day in silence and getting
          ready. I however had business to take care of with Measyn.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Measyn was in his classroom looking over some
          papers when I arrived. &quot;Measyn, may I have a word with you.&quot;
          He looked up at me, &quot;Yes come in and sit down.&quot; I sat in the
          seat next to his desk. &quot;Tomorrow I am going to kill Darish.&quot;
          He looked at me with no expression, &quot;Yarrl…. if you feel that
          you must then may Tunare watch over you. As I told you before I will
          not be able to help.&quot; I thanked him and said, &quot;I have help
          of my own but I do not think I will need additional help from Kelethin
          and if all goes the way I think it will the Orc raids will stop for a
          while at least. For the last several weeks I have been watching the
          Orcs and have learned that they do not trust or like this Dv’inn
          among them. I will be leaving behind this as evidence.&quot; I pulled
          out the Tier’dal dagger. Measyn looked at it and raised his eyebrow
          he knew that Tier’dal’s don’t just leave these weapons behind
          unless they are dead. &quot;Who is the help that you have brought with
          you?&quot; He asked while inspecting the dagger. I answered, &quot;Meassi.&quot;
          He stopped and looked at me. &quot;How is she?&quot; he asked.
          &quot;She is lost, I am helping her find her way. &quot; I answered.
          &quot;I remember that you did not turn you back on her when she was
          banned. Did you not agree with that decision?&quot; I thought for a
          min and said, &quot;Weather I agreed or not it was done. She has
          always tried to follow the correct path, but became misguided. I want
          to help her. We have so much in common. We both need to complete this
          quest.&quot; He looked at min for a min and said, &quot;If this works
          I will release the ban on the city, however she must still prove
          herself in order to win back her community. You Yarrl will also be
          looked upon differently because you will be known to be with
          her.&quot; I replied back to him, &quot;That matters not to me Measyn.
          I have served Tunare and this city well and if people want to judge me
          by who I am with, then let them. I must go now.&quot; I bowed to him.
          &quot;Yarrl, may Tunare watch over you both and protect you.&quot;</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That night I couldn’t sleep. I continued to stare
          at the sky. It was a rare night for Kelethin, there was no fog in the
          forest, the sky was clear and the stars could be seen. It was time to
          go. Meassi was sleeping with a smile on her face; I gently touched her
          arm to wake her up. We were silent. We gathered and took with us just
          what we needed and left the rest here. When we had gotten close enough
          we stopped, I began to chant and Meassi blended into the background
          and became very difficult to see. I chanted again and I was camouflage
          myself as well. I could Meassi starring at me like she wanted
          something; I looked puzzled at her but decided that we need to go,
          &quot;Let’s move in.&quot; We made our way past the entrance slowly
          and past several guards. When we reached the castle the Legionnaires
          were there on guard. We had to move up to the door and wait for the
          door to open. After a few min the door opened and a slave holding
          baskets of fruit and meat came out the door. I looked back to see I
          she was there and we went in. The smell was horrible, it was nothing
          like the Ry’gorr Fort I was in before. Just inside the door there is
          a fountain that delivers fresh water to the castle, however there was
          nothing fresh about it. The water was brown and had what looked like
          blood in it. I look back at Meassi and she didn’t look to good. She
          looked scared and nervous, I gave her hand a little squeeze to let her
          know it’s ok. We rounded the corner of the hallway and there it was
          the Throne with Lord Darish sitting there sleeping upon it. The though
          of revenge made me smile and I looked back at Meassi and she was
          smiling also. &quot;Ready?&quot; I whispered. She nodded yes.</p>
