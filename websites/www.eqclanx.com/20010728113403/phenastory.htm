<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had been working at the Fools Gold for about a month now.
Most of the patrons were either pathetic rouges trying to get a feel under my
dress or drunken warriors who would pick a fight with their own shadow for
following them.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was until he came in. My boss seemed to know him well
and gave him a smile along with a free drink. My boss told me his name was
Jaston and a bit about him. His story was like a hero from a bard&#146;s tale. I
hardly believed a word but his aged face did grab my attention. Something about
it seemed so different. Hard, yet compassionate. Like he couldn&#146;t tell weather
he was good or evil. Like looking at something and not being able to tell
weather it was black or white.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I guess I would be lying if I told you I wasn&#146;t interested.
But he had to be twice my age, probably more than that. I wasn&#146;t sure if it
would be right.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I served him anyway. He was nice enough, and gave me a huge
tip! I could buy a new dress on what he gave. That was when I was sent up to the
rouges. Their first sitting of the month and I had been chosen to cater for
them. I had never done that and I was amazed at how much work it truly was.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">About an hour into my work I finally got a chance to break. I
had just taken a seat in the employee lounge, if you could call a bench and a
dartboard in a small dusty room that, when one of the rouge trainers burst in.
He told me that I had forgot to bring a meal to Garet, their newest recruit. The
trainer said he was sick in his room with a sly smile.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologised quickly and ran to the kitchen. I wasn&#146;t gonna
blow my first opportunity to impress the rouges. They were of course the owners
of the bar and could have sent me packing in a second.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I grabbed a tray of beef and ran back up the stairs. I asked
some of the rouges sitting around where his quarters were. They all smiled
smugly and pointed off to a far room in the back.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I slowly opened the door and saw three men standing there,
looking at me like a piece of meat. That&#146;s when it hit me. I knew what they
were about to do. I dropped the tray to the ground and turned for the door but
before I knew it two of the men had grabbed me and were tying my feet and hands
together. I wanted to scream but Garet, as I know now, approached me and put a
small dagger to my throat, saying if I screamed he would cut out my tongue.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He dismissed the others who left with a quick pinch or fondle
of me. He then set out to touching me all over. Hard. He was very violent and
only the knife at my throat stopped me from screaming.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ordeal ended after what seemed like ages. He cut my ropes
and told me he would be calling for me later. I needed help! I needed it now!</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
        </font></font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3" color="#D2A722" face="ZapfHumnst BT">Told by
Jaston</font></p>
<font size="2"><font FACE="ZapfHumnst BT" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I spent the night in my guild house. Most were glad to see me
come back. It had been too long. In the middle of the night a fellow warrior
shook me. He told me there was a woman there to see me. He said it was urgent.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rixma, Alexadia, or maybe even Sensy or Abbra. Not that I had
never gotten to know any women. Its just that those were to only ones I could
see waking me in my own guild house.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To my surprise it was Phena. Her face streaked with the tears
and her eyes puffy. She was still beautiful though. I began to wish I had put on
more than just my shorts in my rush. That or had a nice place to sit.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She began to ball as she looked at me. &quot;p-p-please. I
know you don&#146;t know me, b-b-b-but I need you to help me. He is c-c-coming back
for me, please, I c-c-can&#146;t go back.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I stifled a grin. No use in letting her know I enjoyed a good
sob story as much as an adventures tale. No doubt something happened in the
rouge guild. Those fools don&#146;t know how to treat a lady.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Miss, Phena is it, I&#146;m sorry but I am a busy man. I
can help you but it will have to be worth my while. Basically I&#146;m askin, whats
in it for me?&quot; I knew better than to get involved with a whole guild, but
if she could make it worth my while&#133;..</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She must have noticed me looking at her. She immediately got
up and began for the door. &quot;Phena,&quot; I called. No use her thinking me a
pig without so much as a stray hand. &quot;If I don&#146;t help you who will. You
come to a drifter come home for a few days for help before a deputy. Where will
you turn next, that foolish Priest of Discord?&quot; This time I laughed out
very loudly. The thought of a Priest helping anyone, even for a &#145;price&#146;.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She looked at me hard. Her eyes drilling into the back of my
head like daggers. She was even beautiful when enraged. I knew when the look
softened a little I had been successful.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I took her by the arm and began to walk her deeper into the
guild. &quot;Please, join me in my chamber. We can discuss your problem, and my
&#145;payment.&#146;&quot; I couldn&#146;t suppress the grin on my face, though I could
hear her crying softly beside me.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know what all of you are thinking. &#145;Jaston you can&#146;t!
Its not right! She is young enough to be your daughter! This is no better than
rape!&#146; But do you honestly think I care what you think? She needed help and I
wanted to have some fun.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I awoke the next morning to hear her screaming. A scream of
terror and blood curdling fear. It was like music to my ears. But something
struck deep inside me. A feeling of sympathy for this young girl.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shook her gently, just enough to wake her. She sat upright
very fast letting the bed sheets fall off her nakedness. Realizing this she
hurried to cover herself, &quot;Don&#146;t worry. Its only me. Anything I haven&#146;t
seen already wasn&#146;t there last night.&quot; I told her flatly.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Still she scrambled to cover herself to the chin. &quot;I&#146;m
sorry. I had a nightmare. It&#133; It was about him. The one you said you would
protect me from.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had almost forgot about that. I guess I had to help her
now. Who knows, maybe I could ask for a further reward when the deed was done
but for now I guess I had to help. &quot;Ok, tell me about this man you need
saving from.&quot; I said, faking any interest in anything above her neck.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;His name is Garet. He is a newly made rouge. Supposedly
he is very talented. .&quot; She began hesitantly, &quot;Last night when I went
to serve the rouges they said he was ill and I needed to bring the food and ale
to his quarters. They were all mischievous grins and sideways glances, but I
hadn&#146;t had this job for long enough to turn them down.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I brought the meal from the kitchen to his room and
almost instantly knew I had been tricked into some sort of rouge initiation. Or
something of the like. I know now that the new rouges are sent other barmaids on
the night of their first meeting, but I wasn&#146;t told of this custom.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jaston knew what she was talking about. The warriors had a
very similar custom, but it involved the &#145;career women&#146; from the back of the
Fools Gold.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;There were three of them&quot; She went on slowly,
tears beginning to swell in her eyes. &quot;Two of them grabbed my arms and legs
and tied them. Then Garet told them to leave. He came up to me and pulled a
dagger. Told me not to scream. Said if I did he would cut out my tongue. He made
me do things, awful things. He touched me everywhere, hard. He hurt me.&quot;
Her words from that point on became nothing but incoherent crying.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After waiting a few minutes I asked her frankly &quot;What
would you have me do?&quot; She looked at me blankly for a moment, then
responded just as flatly as I had asked.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Kill him&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;If it can be done I will kill him&quot; I said. Before
I could continue she was kissing me passionately and hugging me.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Thank you Jaston, you&#146;re my saviour.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I couldn&#146;t help but smile. She was a great girl. We worked
out that she would get me access to the rouge guild and she would lead me
straight to Garet&#146;s chamber. There I was to waltz in and kill him. It would
only be 5-10 years in jail once they found out why I had killed him, and with my
reputation I would be out in less than a month.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And that&#146;s how it went. Phena lead me right to Garet&#146;s
door. I knocked and as he answered and forced myself in. Putting my sword to his
neck I whispered to him softly, &quot;I would expect nothing less from you rouge
scum.&quot; And thrust the tip of my blade through his esophagus.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He was quick though, and rather skilled. He caught me off
balance with his last breath. A dagger appeared in his hand and it was sent
deeply into my chest.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We both fell in a pool of blood. Garet was killed, but the
Clerics were able to save me. Though I&#146;m not sure I will ever be able to fight
the same again. If I ever do fight again. Phena made up some excuse that Garet
had tried to rape her again and I had burst in to save her. None of the rouges
went against her story at the fear of having their secret ritual exposed to
everyone.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Phena came to visit me in my bed every day. I was stuck in it
until the Clerics say I&#146;m okay to leave. I gave her two crumpled notes a week
ago and haven&#146;t seen her since. One was an X in bold black with the initials
JJ written under it. Phena was to bring it to Rixma asap.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other was a notice to my bank. My armour, weapons, and
money was to go to Phena. I never wanted anyone to take advantage of her pretty
face again. I wanted her to live the life of a warrior. Have her own adventures
and come back to tell them to me. I would live my dream through her. Never again
would anyone else take advantage of her. Only me.</p>
