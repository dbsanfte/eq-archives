          heroic question &quot;Death, where is thy sting?&quot; with &quot;It
          is here in my heart and mind and memories.&quot;</font></i></p>
          <font SIZE="2">
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">&quot;You fool!&quot; screamed
          the Dark Elf, enraged by the sight of his cowering son. &quot;How
          pathetic can you possibly be? How difficult is it to simply hold a
          dagger, and attack!?&quot; The boy, trembling, was unable to answer.
          Tears and blood covered his waning, dark blue face. His father had
          been teaching him the ways of the rogue. The boy&#146;s father expected
          him to excel in the art of combat. Today the boy began his training.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">The Tier&#146;dal train as if it
          were real combat, so, Tuval, the boy&#146;s father, attacked his son as
          he would a Fier&#146;dal or a human. Being a respected Rake within the
          Hall of Ebon Mask, having a son with less than amazing abilities was
          an insult. &quot;You would dare shed tears for mere pain?&quot; In an
          uncontrolled fit of rage, Tuval strikes the boy, sending him flying
          across the room. Despite his heritage as a rogue, Tuval had impressive
          strength which matched his larger than normal size. &quot;I will show
          you true pain&quot;</font></p>
    </center>
</center>
          <p ALIGN="left"><img border="0" src="Raven%20Images/Merther5.jpg" align="left" width="198" height="288"><font face="Verdana">&quot;The boy has had enough,
          the day is over. You will continue tomorrow.&quot; Came an unannounced
          voice. Turning to identify this new presence, Tuval found himself
          confronted by his wife, Lana. Standing calmly, her white hair hanging
          loosely on her strong shoulders. Lana&#146;s red eyes stared defiantly
          into those of her husband.</font></p>
        <center>

<center>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">Annoyed at her presence, Tuval
          drew his daggers and lunged at her. She was prepared, however and
          easily evaded his attack. Drawing her own daggers, a twin pair of
          delicately crafted Tier&#146;dal blades, she tensed her stomach and legs
          and prepared to defend herself.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">&quot;You would dare interfere
          with the boy&#146;s training? Perhaps the leader was right in exiling
          you.&quot; He launched a barrage that was met by and equally effective
          set of parries.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">&quot;You have grown slow and
          week Tuval.&quot; Taunted Lana. &quot;You should not stay here and
          waste time with this excuse for a son.&quot; The two had trained
          together for decades and each knew the other almost as well as they
          knew themselves. &quot;Why waste your time with this boy? Norrath is
          ripe for the picking, yet you stay here, growing slow and weak.&quot;</font><img border="0" src="Raven%20Images/Merther.JPG" width="194" height="224" align="right">
</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">With that, she launched her
          body at his, only to find he had already stepped aside. She landed
          hard on the floor, but almost immediately began to get up. But Tuval
          was quick to act. Before she was on her feet, one of Tuval&#146;s daggers
          had already found its way to her side. She fell, and doubled over in
          pain. Tuval turned her onto her stomach, then looked over to his
          trembling son.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">&quot;She does not cry.&quot;
          He said. &quot;Yet she deserves death.&quot; Lana had allied herself
          with many people she had met throughout her life, people whom the Tier&#146;dal
          were forbidden to even interact with, unless it be to do battle.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">He returned his gaze to that
          of his wife, and whispered &quot;You, woman, will never be my equal. I
          may be a fool, but I am not your fool.&quot; Raising his dagger above
          her body, he prepared to thrust it into her spine.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">&quot;May Innoruuk have mercy
          on your soul&quot; She whispered with her final breaths. Closing her
          eyes, accepting her fate, she waited. And then, Tuval ended her life.</font></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana">He stood up and faced his son.
          &quot;This is what your life will be. No one will help you. No one
          will care. All you will feel will be the unending hatred of Innoruuk.
          That is how you will live.&quot; He removed the two blades from his
          wife&#146;s dead body. &quot;Or you will not live at all.&quot; He said,
          looking at his wife&#146;s body. She was now as lifeless as the dagger
          that had killed her; as lifeless as her own dagger, only a few paces
          away from her; as lifeless as her son feared he would be. Tuval then
          walked away, slowly and unwavering, leaving his shivering son huddled
          in the corner, crying.</font></p>
