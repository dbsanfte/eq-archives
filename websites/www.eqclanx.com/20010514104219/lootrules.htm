                All leaders and officers of the Rathe Alliance should read and
                e-mail comments or suggestions to the <a href="mailto:RatheAlliance@yahoogroups.com">Rathe

                <p><font face="ZapfHumnst BT" size="2">Loot and Raid management.</font></p>
                <p><font face="ZapfHumnst BT" size="2">Well its time to make
                sure that everyone understands how things have to run to keep
                everyone alive and well without any bickering and arguing during
                our upcoming raids.</font></p>
                <p><font face="ZapfHumnst BT" size="2">For those of you who have
                been on large scale raids before that have been well run, this
                will be very obvious to you and make a lot of sense. For those
                that have not it will seem like a lot of sense but perhaps once
                in the raid it you may have to stop and think about some of it
                to keep any tempers under control.</font></p>
                <p><font face="ZapfHumnst BT" size="2">So I will start off with
                asking a couple questions and answer them myself.</font></p>
                </font>
                <p align="center"><font face="ZapfHumnst BT" size="3" color="#9999FF">Why
                do we go on large-scale raids?</font></p>
                <font size="2">
                <p><font face="ZapfHumnst BT" size="2">To have fun and
                excitement, and for loot.</font></p>
                <p><font face="ZapfHumnst BT" size="2">If you thought exp was in
                there you are mistaken, once we hit planes don&#146;t be surprised
                if you come back most of the time with less exp then what you
                went up with. For a raid to be fun low deaths are very helpful
                as dying is not a lot of fun, although they can be, so it is
                very important that everyone understand that we are going to get
                some good items for the people in our alliance.</font></p>
                <p><font face="ZapfHumnst BT" size="2">Loot will drop on these
                raids and we will be posting which items drop there after and by
                whom so everyone understands how things have to work to keep
                things fair, and there is no mistaken looting. But if you
                don&#146;t agree with the loot rules just look at it from the other
                side of the coin and see if you were the one rolling on an item
                would you want yourself rolling on it too.</font></p>
                <p><font face="ZapfHumnst BT" size="2">Ok lets get to the
                looting rules: First rule is simple and yet we have seen it over
                and over cause problems, You will only be rolling for loot for
                the toon you bring on the raid, that&#146;s it. If you have another
                toon who could really use an item, we're sorry but you don&#146;t
                get to roll unless its NOT No drop and none of the classes who
                can use it that are at the raid want it, then anyone who wants
                it can try and roll on the item.</font></p>
                <p><font face="ZapfHumnst BT" size="2">But before you roll on an
                item be aware that once you get an item your are done rolling
                until everyone in your class/race has got an item. So if you
                really really want a certain item that may or may not drop in
                the future you might not want to roll on a different item that
                you could win.</font></p>
                <p><font face="ZapfHumnst BT" size="2">Where this can seem
                unfair is if we do a raid and there is only one of a class there
                and a lot of their class only items drop well its going to be a
                looting frenzy for them. Buy perhaps maybe that will be you
                someday also.</font></p>
                <p><font face="ZapfHumnst BT" size="2">When a guild or an
                alliance start to do bigger things and start getting nice items
                there is bound to be some loot envy, and people will be jealous
                of others who win things and you will be looking at your
                inventory cursing how unfair it is (not that I have done this)
                when a good friend or great alliance mate just won an ass
                kicking item. At this point don&#146;t get mad and stay how unfair
                it is or how many times you have shown up and you still have not
                gotten anything. We are just getting started and EVERYONE will
                be getting cool items in time, unfortunately we can not get
                everyone everything they want right off the bat. So don&#146;t
                worry if you don&#146;t get anything or go someplace that nothing
                you want drops at, we WILL be doing more raids and events so
                everyone will get theirs in due time.</font></p>
                <p><font face="ZapfHumnst BT" size="2">Ok guess my self Q and A
                isn&#146;t working out hehe, kinda got off track. Hehe</font></p>
                <p><font face="ZapfHumnst BT" size="2">Once we are in the raid
                it is going to be very important that you listen and keep you
                group leader up to date on your mana buffs and over all
                readiness so he can report to the raid leader if his group is
                good to go or not.</font></p>
                <p><font face="ZapfHumnst BT" size="2">If you have a pet it is
                very important that you keep a very close eye on it as they like
                to wander as we all know, and although it might be fun to fight
                six or seven FGs at once I&#146;m sure we might not come off of
                that one unscathed.</font></p>
                <p><font face="ZapfHumnst BT" size="2">NO WANDERING. If you have
                this sudden urge to go take a peak at a cool looking statue or
                see what&#146;s around the next corner. DON&#146;T. Stay with your
                group and move where the group or raid leader says.</font></p>
                <p><font face="ZapfHumnst BT" size="2">Assisting: Before we
                start it will be made very clear who the Primary assist is,
                everyone will assist that person. And we will have a secondary
                assist so if the primary dies everyone will switch to the
                secondary. And just to be safe we will have a Third person just
                in case. In the confusion that is bound to happen everyone will
                have to make /assist name rather then just /assist.</font></p>
                <p><font face="ZapfHumnst BT" size="2">Ack back to loot for a
                second. Lets say we kill Naggy in the future and of all the loot
                he drops he only drops two Cloak of Flames. The item is all/all.
                (For those who may not know, it&#146;s haste item for the back.)
                Does because its all/all is everyone going to roll???? No. Only
                melee classes will roll on the item. The argument I was given
                was it&#146;s not fair for the casters to do a raid like that and
                not get to roll on anything. Well the way I look at it is an
                item that you can not buy in game for any amount of PP and is
                very doubtful that you will be able to even trade for it, it
                would be only fair to let our melee classes have it.</font></p>
                <p><font face="ZapfHumnst BT" size="2">However the shoe can go
                on the other foot. If a mob where to drop a crown of some sort
                and it had like +7str +7int 12ac and +75 mana all/all (made the
                item up off the top of my head) then it would be casters only
                rolling on it. Only way to keep it fair as far as I see it.</font></p>
                <p><font face="ZapfHumnst BT" size="2">Where it comes down to
                each and everyone of us to be honest and fair with each other is
                if an item drops that you can use and you roll on it and win it
                for the purpose of selling or twinking another toon or a friend
                that is within your right to do so. As you got your one item,
                you do with it as you wish. We would ask though that we try and
                avoid this for now as a lot of peeps out there NEED items and if
                you have a great head piece then be fair and don&#146;t roll on one
                that drops. Like we stated earlier we will all get what we need
                in due time</font></font>
