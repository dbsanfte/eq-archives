A couple of times I had to take a slight detour to avoid bandit camps and wandering orcs, but I soon found myself in the familiar City in the Trees.<p>The story I told Sylia was worthy of a song, and she said as much.  As I related to her the amount and intensity of my combats she gave me some very good advice.  "Buy a shield."  I hadn't thought of that before, never having been that focused on combat before, but she insisted that a shield would have protected me much better than a sword would.<p>Since I was there, I went ahead and asked her about my progress - showing off my skill with the drum, and my mastery of the few spellsongs I knew.  Sylia then gave me a rather funny look and asked me if I thought I thought I was ready for the next rank.  I had to stop and think about that - was I really ready?  Had I learned all I could at this rank?  I finally decided that, yes, I had, and was rewarded with a huge, beaming smile, as she congratulated me on my new rank.  <p>"You see, Talies, there comes a time when we must decide for ourselves that we are ready to move on.  You have reached that point now - I feel you should be quite capable of deciding when you are ready to learn more.  Self-confidence is a very important attribute for a Bard.  You must believe in yourself before others will believe in you."<p>Having imparted that wisdom, she dismissed me, claiming time for other young Bards, and I retired to the back room to rest and perhaps pick up that song I often heard them singing back there.<p>"Hymn of Restoration" it's called, and it's written for stringed instruments, but for now, I think I'll keep it simple and just learn the words.  The melody is complex, yet very well put-together. I find it quite relaxing, yet stimulating,  a very strange combination, indeed.  Truly an amazing song, and one that makes me thankful that I'm a Bard.<p>With this song, a shield, and some better armour, I think perhaps I can begin to adventure a little more fearlessly - tomorrow, I'll see where the winds take me!<p><CENTER><IMG SRC="joatmenu.gif" USEMAP="#joatmenu" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=41 WIDTH=384 ALT="menubar."></CENTER><MAP NAME="joatmenu"><AREA HREF="joat14.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="0,0,38,41"><AREA HREF="joat.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="161,0,222,41"><AREA HREF="joat16.htm" SHAPE="rect" COORDS="346,0,384,41"></MAP><p> Page maintained by <A HREF="mailto:snicker@pinkpig.com">Snicker Furfoot, Esq.</A>  Please send all comments, questions, or suggestions to him.</BODY></HTML>
