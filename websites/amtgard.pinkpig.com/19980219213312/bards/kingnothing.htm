Track five from the CD Load. I was thinking about my office when I began to listen closely to the lyrics. This isn't a perfect transcript, the lyrics aren't in the album cover, so I had to sit down with the pause button and headphones to get what I here present.<p><PRE>	"King Nothing"Wish I may, wish I might  Have this wish I wish tonight  Are you satisfied?Dig for gold, dig for fame  You dig to make your name  Are you pacified?All the wants you waste  All the things you chased						_And it all crashes down                  (Chorus)  And you break your crown  And you point your finger but there's no one aroundJust want one thing  Just to play the King  But the castle's crumbled and you're left with just a nameWith your crown came nothing  (Where's your crown?)                  _(End Chorus)Hot and cold block your soul  The heart as hard as gold  Are you satisfied?Wish I might, wish I may  You wish your life away  Are you pacified?All the wants you waste  All the things you chased(Chorus)I wish I may, I wish I might  Have this I wish tonightI want that style, I want it now  I want it all, and I don't care howCareful what you wish, careful what you say  Careful what you wish, you may regret it  Careful what you say, you just might get itNothing  No, you're just nothingWith your crown came nothingNo, you're just nothingAbsolutely nothing</PRE><IMG SRC="tab.gif">Almost all of us who wind up wearing a crown are handed a great deal of responsibility and obligation. With this, we are given almost nothing butour own resources to work with in fulfilling these obligations. (what castle?) We have only our own skills, talents, abilities, and whatever friends and people are willing to help. We are given no promise of reward other than the satisfaction of doing the job well. I dismisstitles/honors/whatever, for I have seen the worthy overlooked, and the unworthy elevated due to various reasons that are not entirely germaine here.<p><IMG SRC="tab.gif">Both the power/title-hungry, and those genuinely trying to help the club have and will continue to run for, and hold these offices. In some cases, it is difficult to tell one from the other. This will probably start accusations flying, but only each individual has even the hope of knowing their own true motivations. The lyrics seem to best target the power-hungry and glory hounds. (Esp: dig gold/fame; want style, want now, don't care how) Only my personna side understands this, (oh well, guess I do as well)I just wish the price of this did not include the weal of the populace so ruled. This too have I seen far too often. I fear I am trying in vain to clean up such a mess now. (Plenty of blame to go around, so don't feel singled out, you.) I wish this were not so (Yes, the lyrics again.), but Iknow this won't come true. The greedy will continue to dupe and manipulate the masses to achieve their goals, so all I can do is hope to warn others to be on guard for the smiling face with the envenomed blade. <p><IMG SRC="tab.gif">"I wish I may, I wish I might" It seems always to be the fate of the ruler to desire so much for the land, and yet be able to achieve so little of it. I strive, yet every obstacle seems to sap needed energy. Perserverence is not sufficient, the drain on the self, like sands in an hourglass, slowly saps the energy until the ruler is left but a husk. It is happening to me;I have watched it happen to some of my most capable friends. Perhaps we just aim too high. I don't know. I will think more on this, and see what I come up with.<p><IMG SRC="tab.gif">I have but two weeks left 'ere I hand the crown to my successor. It is too late now to achieve much of what I sought. I can only balance that againstwhat has been accomplished. All I can do now is pave the road for my successors, and hope to convince and help them to finish what I started. I will gladly hand over these shackles. I have six months to regenerate before I apply to wear them again. Next time I shall be better prepared. Oh well, my thoughts for what good they will do. Time to think about track 8, Bleeding Me.<p><IMG SRC="tab.gif">In Service to The Dream,<p>Eric the Grey<BR>Pro-tem Regent/GMR/Whatever, Irongate<BR>DustDancer, Bastard of the GP<BR>Thursday, April 10, 1997</FONT><p><a href="index.html"><IMG SRC="harp2.gif" border=0 alt="Back to the Bard's Guild"><br>Back to the Bard's Guild!</a></BODY><!--Created with Hippie by Snicker Furfoot on Mon May 05 01:37:55 1997 --></HTML>
