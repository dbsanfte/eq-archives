<img src="tab.gif" alt=" ">Like most good things it just happened.  At the Double Wars
in Sweden in 1994, myself and several other Americans working in Germany
attended. Now if you have ever had a run in with the authenticity police,
imagine an event with over 200 APs running around for a whole week. The
Swedes play with gusto. Their encampments are the most period that I have
seen anywhere. If you don't have a period tent, you have to set up in
another area. Most of the Swedes had never seen or encountered the SCA
American style. Many thought that they had invented it. But the main
element that we noticed was that they were taking the game and themselves
MUCH TOO SERIOUSLY. 
<br>
<img src="tab.gif" alt=" ">Interject into this environment five middle-aged Americans, getting wide around the middle who had been playing the game forever. (I started playing
back in 1974). We interjected some comic relief into the event. They didn't
quite know what to think about us when we set up our plastic tents and
Coleman stove. They did notice that we were having too much fun and as the
week went by more and more of the folks were coming to our encampment. 
<br>
<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">About halfway through the event, they had a four man melee tournament.
Each team had to come up with a name. As you can imagine, most of the
Swedes took these serious, macho sounding, manly names, like the Red Death,
or the Sharks. Well when asked what our name would be we chose "Four Fat
Guys". On the bridge battles we devastated them. We came in second in the
tourney. During the wars, if they needed a shield wall broken the cry was
"Send in the Fat Guys!"  The name stuck. For the rest of the event we were
known as the "Fat Guys." By the end of the event we had come up the
definition of living large. That's how it started. The only official status
we have is the right to impose a beer tax at all feasts in the kingdom as
long as we insure that the King will never go dry. We also host a "Beer Pit
Tourney" at the Double Wars. Each entrant has to bring a beer to enter,
Squires must bring two,  and Knights, a six-pack. The winner of the tourney gets all the
beer. We are known to ask the King quite publicly "Is this going to be a
one, two, ... or six beer court?"

<center><h3>Explanations of the Fat Guy Songs</h3></center>


<A NAME="axel"></A>
<p>
<center><h4>The Tale of Sir Axel</h4>
</center>
<p>
<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">In Germany the word "Ausfart" means "EXIT" and is posted
on all freeway exits. The word "Umlitung" means "Detour". Back in 1984 Sir
Axel in court asked the visiting King of the East (Drachenwald was a
principality back then) to go a quest to find the Holy Grail. He was
convinced it was in the town of Ausfart. From there on the Ballad explains
itself.
<p>
<A NAME="obese"></a>
<p>
<center><h4>Obese</h4>
</center>
<p>
<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" "> A Fat Guy tabard is green with a gold mug. The handle of the mug
goes under the shield (to protect it). If the Fat Guy is a King or Prince
(or Count, Earl, etc.) he can put foam on top of the mug. We've had a few. 
<A NAME="blackleaf"></a>
<p>
<center><h4>Ballad of Blackleaf.</h4></center>
 
<p>
<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">Baron Matthew Blackleaf - one the first four Fat Guys. He first Viceroy of the Crown Principality of Nordmark (Sweden) and will be King of Drachenwald
this Jan. He didn't learn.
<A NAME="cookie"></A>
<p>
<center><h4>Cookie Wars</h4></center>
 
<p>
<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">An event held every summer in Germany. It is always around
some kind of cookie theme. This song was written the morning after as I gazed at
 the broken cookie crumbs and empty beer bottles. It wrote itself. 
<A NAME="3drunk"></A>
<p>
<center><h4>Three Drunken Fat Guys</h4></center>
 
<p>
<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">Pretty much happened as the song went. In 1996
Michael of Aquitane (another of the original four and the one who came up
with the name) was made a Queen's Companion being described at the
personification chivalry and Grace in the Kingdom (You have to have met him
to understand why half the kingdom was rolling on the floor). The King and
Queen were trying hard to make us respectable. They didn't. 
<A NAME="thumper"></A>
<p>
<center><h4>Thumper</h4></center>

<p>
<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" "> One of the fat guys, Friedrich Karl von Wolfstein,  fights with a huge two handed war hammer. In wars he likes to hide in tree and jump out and pound people with it. One of Michael of Aquitane's more notorious doings was to cheer on a friend in a
crown tourney - shouting "Pound him into the ground like a tent peg into a
grape". After his friend won and became king he augmented Michael's arms
to a tent peg going through a grape. 
<A NAME="helmut"></A>
<p>
<center><h4>Helm&uuml;t's Home Brew </h4></center>

<p>
<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" "> One Fat Guy, Helm&uuml;t von Dornheim,  makes cordials of really strange combinations.(He still hasn't gotten his Baloney Schnapps right yet). He
has a warning label on the back of each bottle with the warning in the
song. 
<A NAME="knaeckebroed"></A>
<p>
<center><h4>Oh Knaeckebroed</h4></center>
 
<p>
<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">This is a hard flat bread that has holes on one side and
is flat on the back. One of the Double Wars in Sweden is the Knaeckebroed
War. It is fought to determine which side of the bread will be buttered at
all events for the next year. They get very passionate about the subject up
there. 
<A NAME="garick"></A>
<p>
<center><h4>Count Garick's Tale of Woe<br>and<br>Where has all the Count's Beer Gone?</h4></center>

<p>
<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">At last years Beer Pit Tourney, Count Garick
was the winner. There was a stream running through the sites, and he built
a small dam and put his winnings there. It rained that night and it all
washed away into a lake (at least a case and half). He only recovered one
beer. 
<a name="elffin"></A>
<p>
<center><h4>Duke Elffin, Duchess Vanna</h4></center>

<p>
<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">The first King and Queen, and now Duke and
Duchess of Drachenwald. Back at our first crown tourney, Elffin had just
arrived in Europe from Australia. He was knight at the time and got a
waiver to allow him to fight in crown. He did not have a Lady, and asked
the person he was staying with if she knew a suitable Lady he could fight
for. They called up Vanna and she agreed to let him fight for her. None of
them had ever seen him fight, and did not expect him to win. Vanna was not
able to make it the tourney, and got a surprising phone call telling her
that she was now Queen. During his first reign, he was constantly starting
his sentences "In the West we..". 
<a name="feathers"></A>
<p>
<center><h4>White Feathers/Blue Feathers</h4></center>

<p>
<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">When I heard about a group of SCAdians
wearing white feathers to show that did not want adult jokes or stories
told around them, the song just wrote itself.
<p>



<A NAME="6beercourt"></A>
<p>
<center><h4>6 Beer Court In Drachenwald</h4>
</center>
<p>
<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" "> Most scadians have at one time or another attended a "Court that would not
end".  At double wars last year , I had asked King Elffin  "Is this going
to be a 2, 3, or 4 beer court?. He replied, that it was going to be at
least a Six. While it was a long court, I was only half way through my 4th
beer by the time it ended. 6 Beer Court indeed! But it got me to thinking
about a a Six Beer Court. Latter, when I heard "Little Honda" on the Radio,
the chorus and Title fell into place. The awards and Honors listed are ones
given out in Drachenwald.  
<p>

<A NAME="martin"></A>
<p>
<center><h4>Martin the Mercenary</h4>
</center>
<p>
<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">If you look on the Fat Guys Web Page, there is a photo of Martin the Mercenary where his feet have left the ground while he delivers a blow. 
<p>

<A NAME="axeandmace"></A>
<p>
<center><h4>Just Use an Axe and Mace</h4>
</center>
<p>
<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">"Just Use an Axe and Mace" was inspired by a conversation at a fighting practice. In wars I prefer to fight with an Axe and a Mace. It's the funnest combination I've ever found.  
<p>

<A NAME="nonogogo"></a>
<p>
<center><h4>The No-No, Go-Go Song</h4>
</center>
<p>
<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">"The No-No, Go-Go song" came from a couple sources. At an Event last Jan, I
set up a Fat Guy encampment at one side of the site. We had a large tent,
portable fireplace, Beer table, Several cases of Beer, a case of single
malt scotch, soft drinks. etc. We had lots of fun and good times. So did
most of those who visited the camp. But one lady, took offense at my song
"the Codpiece" and complained for weeks afterwards to many peers that it
wasn't right since we had the only encampment at the site. Totally ignoring
the fact that the feast hall was open all night. When this was finally
brought to my attention a few weeks latter, my reaction was "So?". The
common response from the peers was "What did you expect?, it was Fat Guy
Camp." (I love living in Drachenwald). But it got me to thinking, what if I
was pushing-for-a-peerage and had to "clean up my act" to please the peers.
What could save me from such a respectable fate? At the Last Celtic Sheep
and Garter Raids, the Fat Guy Wench and another lady pulled off drive by
schmoozings with a cloven fruit at all the encampments. If that wouldn't
reconvert somebody to Fun, I don't know what would.
<p>
<A NAME="getalife"></a>
<p>
<center><h4>"Get a Life" says the Baron</h4>
</center>
<p>
<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">One of my few serious songs. A response to some silly local politics that have been dragging on for the last few years in my local group. It got so
bad at times that I used to sign off my E-mails with "It's hard to live
large when you live in Mayberry RFD". Leaving out specific names and
incidents, the Barony got so disfunctional  that it was put under a
Vicker. We became a Barony again half a year ago and for the most part,
things have been going well. But the "Courtiers" have started to surface
again. This song is my answer to the "courtiers" as they try to drag me
into their plots and schemes. 

<p>
<A NAME="nightfight"></a>
<p>
<center><h4>They Made Us Fight at Night</h4>
</center>
<p>
<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">In Sweden, there is very little sun during the winter. At a few events this year they decided to try torch-light fighting. While I did not
personally fight in these, I have been in enough tourneys and fighter
practices where the final rounds were fought after the sun went down. The
tales I have heard from those who did participate matched my experiences
in night fighting.


<p>

<A NAME="prothalslament"></a>
<p>
<center><h4>Sir Prothal's Lament</h4>
</center>
<p>
<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">Sir Prothal's Lament was the Idea of The Right Honorable Lord Goetz von der Krautlache. Sir Prothal has had a long standing feud with the combat
archers. Last year at the Double Wars he went around and congratulated
every fight who killed and archer, no matter what side they fought on. The
references in the song about standing still for the Queen, came from one
field battle where the then Crown Princess was chasing him all over the
field shouting "Will you stand still?!" Sir Prothal is from Sweden and for
some unexplained reason most of the Swedes are very fond of Mountain Dew.
It is one of the preferred bribes for their mercenary fighters. They do not
sell it there so it is a very precious item.
