<STRONG> <H2><A NAME="ball">The Ball of Kerriemur (Ballynore) </A></H2></STRONG>


Oh the Ball, the Ball, the Ball of Kerriemur,<BR>
Where your wife an his wife were doin it on the floor...<BR>
<BR>
'Twas on the first of August, the party, it began.<BR>
Now, never shall I forget, me lads, the gatherin' of the clans...<BR>
<BR>
Singin--- Who hae ye lassie, Who hae ye noo?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tha mon wha hae ye last nicht, He cannae hae ye noo.<BR>
<BR>
'Twas the gatherin' o' the clans, and everyone was there,<BR>
A-playin wi' tha lassies, an' twinin curly hairs...<BR>
<BR>
Four an twenty virgins, came down from Inverness<BR>
An when tha Ball were o'er there were four and twenty less...<BR>
<BR>
John McGowan, the father, was very surprised to see<BR>
Four and twenty maidenheads a-hangin from the tree...<BR>
<BR>
There were dancin' in the meadow, there was dancin in the ricks<BR>
An ye couldnae hear the bagpipes fer tha swishin o' tha pricks...<BR>
<BR>
The bride was in the parlor, explainin to the groom,<BR>
"The vagina, not the rectum is the entrance to the womb..."<BR>
<BR>
The Queen was in the parlor, eating bread an honey,<BR>
The King was in the parlormaid and she was in the money...<BR>
<BR>
The parson's daughter, she was there a sittin way down front<BR>
A wreath of roses in her hair, and a carrot in her cunt...<BR>
<BR>
And the parson's wife, she was there, her arse against the wall,<BR>
Shoutin to the laddie boys, " I'll take ye one and all"...<BR>
<BR>
It's the first lady forward, and the second lady back,<BR>
And the third lady's finger in the second lady's crack...<BR>
<BR>
The village butcher, he was there, a cleaver in his hand.<BR>
And everytime he turned around, he circumcised the band...<BR>
<BR>
Now, all the ladies back, with your arses against the wall,<BR>
If ye cannae get fucked at Kerriemur, ye cannae get fucked at all!...<BR>
<BR>
The village priest, oh, he was there and on the floor he sat,<BR>
Amusin himself by abusin himself and catchin it in his hat...<BR>
<BR>
They was doin' in the kitchen, and doin' it on the stones.<BR>
Ya couldna' hear the music for the wheezin' and the groans...<BR>
<BR>
The undertaker, he went there dressed in a long black shroud,<BR>
Swingin from the chandelier and pissin on the crowd...<BR>
<BR>
The mayor's daughter she was there, and kept the crowd in fits,<BR>
By jumpin off the mantle piece and landin on her tits...<BR>
<BR>
Singin--- Who hae ye lassie, Who hae ye noo?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tha mon wha hae ye last nicht, He cannae hae ye noo.<BR>
<BR>
There was screwin on the banister, an screwin on the stairs<BR>
You couldnae see the carpet for the mess of curly hairs...<BR>
<BR>
The village idiot, he was there, he was a perfect fool<BR>
He sat beneath the old oak tree and whittled off his tool...<BR>
<BR>
The village whore now she was there, a layin' on the floor<BR>
And every time she opened her legs the suction closed the door...<BR>
<BR>
The village baker he was there, so drunk he began to scream<BR>
He grabbed the girls like great big tarts and pumped them full of cream...<BR>
<BR>
The village potter he was there he made a dong of clay<BR>
He sat little girls upon the wheel and gave them all a lay...<BR>
<BR>
The village rabbi he was there, treatin' a knife like a toy<BR>
He swung and swished and he took an inch off every man and boy...<BR>
<BR>
The village acrobat he was there, a' screwin' on the stair<BR>
The bannister broke, he doubled his stroke and finished her off in midair...<BR>
<BR>
The village hunter he was there, polishin' his gun with skill<BR>
Four girls were all barin' their asses, waitin' for the kill...<BR>
<BR>
The village fool now he was there, he had an amazin' lack of wits<BR>
For every time a girl would pass, he'd just drool on her tits...<BR>
<BR>
The village virgin she was there, the poor girl got a scare<BR>
But from under her dress she heard a voice "It's only my tongue up there!"...<BR>
<BR>
The village swordsman he was there, he had a rod like a train<BR>
And when he rammed an ass they cried, "My god he impaled my brain"...<BR>
<BR>
The village constable he was there, a-twirlin' his billy stick<BR>
Surprised were all the girls to find it was really a twelve inch prick...<BR>
<BR>
The village maiden now she was there, a clingin' to her dress<BR>
Bein' chased by a hoard of horny priests, her sins they would confess...<BR>
<BR>
The village nun she was there, great stains upon her habit<BR>
That was because she spent the night screwin' like a rabbit...<BR>
<BR>
The village postman, he was there, the puir min had tha pox,<BR>
He could nae fuck the lassies, so he fucked the letter box...<BR>
<BR>
The chimney sweep, yes he was there, but soon he got the boot,<BR>
For every time he farted, he filled the room with soot...<BR>
<BR>
The groom was now excited, and racing through the halls,<BR>
Pullin on his pecker and a-showin off his balls...<BR>
<BR>
Big John, the farmer, swore an oath, then cursed an spat,<BR>
For his forty acre corn field was completely fuckin flat...<BR>
<BR>
And when the Ball was over, this opinion was expressed:<BR>
Although they liked the music, the screwin was the best...<BR>
<BR>
Singin--- Who hae ye lassie, Who hae ye noo?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tha mon wha hae ye last nicht, He cannae hae ye noo.<BR>

<STRONG> <H2><A NAME="bonny">The Bonny Black Hare</A></H2></STRONG> 


      On the fourteenth of May, at the dawn of the day,<BR>
      With me gun on my shoulder, to the woods I did stray,<BR>
      In search of some game, if the weather proved fair,<BR>
      To see could I get a shot at the bonny black hare.<BR>
<BR>
      Well I met a young girl, with the face of a rose.<BR>
      And her skin was as fair as the lily that grows.<BR>
      I says "Tell me, fair maiden, why ramble you so?<BR>
      Can you tell me where the bonny black hare do go?"<BR>
<BR>
      And the answer she gave me, her answer was, "No,<BR>
      But it's under me apron that they say it do go.<BR>
      And if you'll not deceive me, I'll vow and declare,<BR>
      That we'll both go together toward the bonny black hare."<BR>
<BR>
      Well, I lay this girl down, with her face to the sky,<BR>
      And I pulls up me ramrod, and me bullets likewise.<BR>
      I says, "Lock your legs 'round me and dig in with your heels,<BR>
      For the closer we get, love, the better it feels."<BR>
<BR>
      Now the birds, they were singin', in the bushes and trees.<BR>
      And the song that they sang is "She's easy to please!"<BR>
      And I felt her heart quiver, and I knew what I'd done.<BR>
      Says I, "Have you had enough, of me old sportin' gun?"<BR>
<BR>
      And the answer she gave me, her answer was, "Nay,<BR>
      For it's not often young sportsmen like you come my way.<BR>
      Now if your powder be willin', and your bullets fly fair,<BR>
      Why don't you keep firin' at the bonny black hare?"<BR>
<BR>
      Now, me powder is wasted, me bullets all gone.<BR>
      Me ramrod is limber, I cannot fire on.<BR>
      But I'll be back in the mornin', and if you are still here,<BR>
      We'll both go together, towards the bonny black hare.<BR>

<STRONG> <H2><A NAME="femmoose">I Like a Moose (feminist)</A></H2></STRONG> 


There's an infamous song goin' round 'bout a moose<BR>
It's really quite funny and quite full of juice,<BR>
But all of it's told from a masculine view,<BR>
And a lot of us women want to get a piece too.<BR>
<BR>
Chorus:<BR>
Moose, moose, I want a moose<BR>
I've never had anything quite like a moose<BR>
I've had lots of lovers, my life has been loose.<BR>
But I've never had anything quite like a moose.<BR>
<BR>
I figured it all out one day by myself.<BR>
When my man went off and left me on the shelf.<BR>
He'd found him a new love, a nubile moose-ess.<BR>
Which gave me a bad case of rampant distress.<BR>
<BR>
"What's sauce for the gander is sauce for the goose."<BR>
Said I as I set out to find me a moose;<BR>
But I ran into problems that men do not mind,<BR>
For male moose are seasonal creatures you'll find.<BR>
<BR>
I hunted in winter, I hunted in spring,<BR>
I hunted all summer and found not a thing;<BR>
But I found my moose when leaves started to fall<BR>
And.... oh brother! Did I have a ball!<BR>
<BR>
With my arms round his barrel, my feet by his tail<BR>
I hanged and we banged and we really did flail,<BR>
Bouncing and jouncing I came with a roar<BR>
I never had had such a great lay before.<BR>
<BR>
But autumn soon passed and so I said good-bye<BR>
I'll be here next year when autumn leaves start to fly;<BR>
Yes I will be here when the leaves start to fall<BR>
And I know for certain, we'll ball and we'll ball.<BR>
<BR>
And so my dear sisters, I have to confess<BR>
Being screwed by a moose, it is really the best<BR>
But you'll make out with others for most of the year.<BR>
For male moose are seasonal creatures I fear.<BR>
<BR>
A bear in the winter is furry and warm<BR>
And if you don't tickle, he'll do you no harm.<BR>
In spring try an eagle, his feathers are light<BR>
That is, if you are not afraid of great height.<BR>
<BR>
In summer, I fear, you must make do with men.<BR>
But, not to worry, soon fall comes again.<BR>
Then you can return to your own faithful moose<BR>
And revel in simply scrumptious screws.<BR>
