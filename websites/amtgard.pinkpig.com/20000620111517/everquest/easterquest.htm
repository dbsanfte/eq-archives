No, we're not talking brightly-coloured poultry products.  We're talking tidbits of humour that the programmers have hidden for their own egos or for our amusement.  EverQuest, like many other popular computer programs, has it's share of Easter Eggs, and this site is an attempt to document many of them.  <font size=-2> (Last Updated May 19, 2000)</font><p><B>WARNING!  There are MANY spoilers ahead!  If you don't want your fun spoiled, then read no further!</B><p>Found an Easter Egg and want to share?  Drop me a line!  <A HREF="mailto:snicker@pinkpig.com">Talies the Wanderer</A>.  Please don't send me pictures of coordinates on walls or obvious visual bugs (like the recent spate of mip-mapping errors.)  These are not Easter Eggs.<p><br>New eggs are marked with <IMG SRC="eeggnew.gif" HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALT="NEW!!!">.<br>Updates are marked with <IMG SRC="updated.gif" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=46 ALT="Updated!">.<hr>People</H2>Everquest is populated with hundreds of non-player characters (or NPCs).  With so many opportunities for bad puns and inside jokes, who could resist throwing in a few silly character names?<p><IMG SRC="eegg1.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*"> Bait Masterson is found in East Freeport where he spawns on the shore near the rock in the middle of the water.  His name is a reference to William Barclay "Bat" Masterson, the American frontier lawman known for his good looks and ivory-handled pistols.  This Bait, however, seems only interested in fishing...<br><FONT size=-2>Some people have suggested a less-than-honourable reason for the name - claiming that he must have become a master at his chosen profession of baiting - however, I chose to ignore that one.</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg2.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">In HighKeep, there was a High-Elven princess being kept captive. She has since been moved to somewhere... else... Her name is Princess Lenya.  When she was still a resident, if you hailed her, she said "Aren't you a little short for a High Keep Guard?"  There is still a "Princess Lenia" in a jail cell downstairs - but she's a little different...<br>Anyway, her name (and her comment) referred to Princess Leia in Star Wars.<p><IMG SRC="eegg3.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Guards Regis and Philbin in the Qeynos Hills area. These both refer to Regis Philbin, popular daytime TV host.<p><IMG SRC="eegg4.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">In South Karana, you'll find a Bard at the fountain named Vhalen which could be interpreted as an abbreviation for Van Halen, a rock and roll band.<br><font size=-2> Others have suggested "Valen" - a character from the popular Science Fiction television show "Babylon Five" - however, in light of his musical nature, I'm sticking with the first interpretation.  That, and his comments - see the next egg....</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg2.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Vhalen also has some interesting things to say about a bard named "Metala" - perhaps a rivalry between Van Halen and Metallica?<p><IMG SRC="eegg1.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Speaking of Metallica, check out the two Barbarians in West Karanas - Lars and Ulrich.  Lars Ulrich is the drummer for the Napster-hating band.<br><font size=-2>Thanks to John Herrington, Kortalh Rhufoniog and Robbie Bemrich</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg3.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Once upon a time, Fire Beatles roamed just outside of Freeport.  Sadly, they, like their namesakes, are no more.  Perhaps there will be a reunion tour? <br><font size=-2>Thanks to Drax</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg5.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">A bard merchant in Freeport is named Jekel Enheid - like "Dr. Jekell and Mr. Hyde", a novel by Robert Louis Stevenson.<p><IMG SRC="eegg6.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Cubert, the Gelatinous Cube underneath Qeynos, is a reference to a popular arcade game during the 80's: Q-Bert.<p><IMG SRC="eegg2.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Lake Rathetear has a Prince Kyrmt Keroppi - the frogluk.  Kin to Kermit the Frog, perhaps?  Plus, his title, Prince, suggests the Frog Prince of fairytale fame - feel like kissing a frog anyone?  Also, Keroppi is the name of one of Hello Kitty's friends, who just happens to be a frog.  A triple pun!  (thanks to far too many people to note here)<p><IMG SRC="eegg3.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">In North Karana, a giant wanders around by the name of Timber the Tiny.  A reference to Tiny Tim, the very unusual musician made famous for his ukelele and falsetto performances.  Made more humourous by the apparent forgetfulness of the Giant (judging by what he drops).  I wonder if he "tiptoes through the tulips" in his sandals?  Of course, there is also a "Tiny Tim" in Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol," but I hardly see the relevance...<p><IMG SRC="eegg1.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Silly Bard names!  You've seen them everywhere - but where oh where is the oft-rumoured Fabian?  His real-life namesake was a popular singer in the Fifties and early Sixties.  But much like his namesake, he is nowhere to be seen now.<p><IMG SRC="eegg5.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">At the very bottom of Ak'anon, they have a scrapyard, and who should maintain that Scrapyard but one Sanfyrd Montop (his name has recently changed to Sanfyrd Featherhead for a Ranger quest, but Ak'anon quest messages still refer to the old name).  This is quite possibly an homage to that lovable cantankerous old coot, salvage-yard owner Fred Sanford, as seen on "Sanford and Son," a sitcom during the 70's.  Added trivia bonus: Fred Sanford was played by Redd Foxx, whose real name was John Elroy Sanford.<p><IMG SRC="eegg6.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">In Kedge Keep, two high-powered sharks go by the names of "Cauldronboil" and "Cauldronbubble" - reference's to Shakespeare's  MacBeth.<p><IMG SRC="eegg1.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">In Kithicor Forest, three named tigers can be found by the names of Reggit, Eenot, and Hobbes(?) - apparently plays on three famous tigers: Tigger, Tony and Hobbes from Calvin and Hobbes.<br><font size=-2>Thanks to John Beckemeier</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg3.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">By the shore of the lake in the West Commonlands sits a lonely man skipping stones.  His name?  Skippyn Stoneshear.  ("Skipping Stones Here").  Someone buy him a fishing pole, so he has something else to do.<p><IMG SRC="eegg2.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">The Gnomes of Steamfont are no less free from punsters - just watch that dirty little backstabbing Feddi Dooger - which some have said is a reference to that horror-film villain, Freddy Krueger.  I guess he's a real nightmare to the younguns.<br><font size=-2>Thanks to John Herrington and Kevin Miller</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg1.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Also in Steamfont, you will find a lovely little clockwork spider named Charlotte - after the title spider in Charlotte's Web.<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Garon Galloway</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg4.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">In Dagnor's Cauldron, there are two rats by the names of Flotsam and Jetsam - methinks they escaped a sinking ship somewhere... (Flotsam refers to any wreckage left in the sea after a shipwreck, while jetsam is any cargo deliberately thrown overboard and washed ashore or sunk.)  Incidentally, these also happen to be the names of the two electric eels who harassed Ariel in Disney's "The Little Mermaid."<br>In another possible nod to Metallica (or perhaps just coincidence) Flotsam and Jetsam was also the name of a band - one of their former members (Jason Newsted) is now Metallica's bassist.<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Kelton Lightforge, Scott Salyers, Toreck Troublemaker, Mark Ellister and Eric Statlander</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg5.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Highkeep sports an unusually large number of strange names for guards.  Stop by and visit with Chopin and Bach (in the music room) Bolton (Michael's cousin?), Antilles (Wedge! I gotcher back!), and Duras (which some say is phonetic for "Guard Yer ass" - No, I don't think this was a reference to Klingons).  You can also visit the prison, where you may see Guards Handy and Chin (Chin guard, hand guard).<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Megtilia Drunkshadow, Scott Ervin and others</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg6.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">The desert of South Ro has some pretty dry humour, too - check out the Sand Giant "Hassan" - a reference to a classic Warner Brother's character... "Hasan.... CHOP!"<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Ninvaen</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg3.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Sirran the Lunatic, a Halfling in the Plane of Sky, is said to be an anagram of a GM - Narris the Lunatic the Halfling GM.<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Josh Ward</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg1.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">The West Karanas also boasts Sir Loin.  Beef. It's what's for dinner.<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Marcus J Witt</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg4.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Another resident of the Plane of Air, this one is much more rare (ooo - poetry!).  His name is Nottap Ekim - which is Mike Patton, from Faith No More, spelled backwards.<br><font size=-2>Thanks to William A Stubbs</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg5.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, they say.  So, apparently, are bad puns.  Two of the Beholders in the Gorge of King Xorbb are named "Syrkl" and "Sviir" - or Circle and Sphere.  Also, Xorbb could be interpreted as "Orb" - another round joke...<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Bridget</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg3.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Here's one for the "truly obscure" category - In Qeynos, near the city gates, stands a man by the name of Tubal Weaver.  He is terribly greedy and overcharges horribly, and doesn't pay nearly enough for goods.  In Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, there is a similarly stingy and dishonest fellow, also by the name of Tubal...<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Maben Wolfbrother</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg2.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Now, I haven't verified this one, but it is said that there are two guards on the stone bridge in North Karana - the one on the East being named Oistyn, and the West being Westyn.  <br><font size=-2>Thanks to Scott Salyers</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg1.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Even the newly discovered outpost of Firiona Vie isn't safe from rampaging puns - the bankers there are known as Wella and Wellford Fargin.  Predecessors to the great Wells Fargo, perchance? <br><font size=-2>Thanks to Karisma Swiftarrow</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg6.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Garrison Keillor makes his appearance in Neriak, in the form of Guard G'Noir - which is possibly a play on "Guy Noir" - a character in his famous "Prairie Home Companion."<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Tszaaz E'Taurguin</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg1.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Even the newly discovered outpost of Firiona Vie isn't safe from rampaging puns - the bankers there are known as Wella and Wellford Fargin.

Just check out these little tidbits!<p><IMG SRC="eegg1.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">My personal favourite for simplicity has got to be Qeynos.  Spelled backwards, it's SonyEQ.<p><IMG SRC="eeggnew.gif" HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALT="NEW!!!">The Gods must be crazy - or at least, the people who made them are; their names are FULL of anagrams.<br>Fennin Ro (from the Plane of Fire) = Infernno (yes, slightly misspelled)<br>The Rathe (from the Plane of Earth) = The Earth<br>Xegony (from the Plane of Air) = Oxygen<br>Veeshan (child of Xegony, ruler of the sky) = Heavens<br>Tarew Marr (from the Plane of Water) = Water, Marr is similar to Mare, Latin for "sea".<br>Povar (from the Plane of Water) = Vapor<br>E'ci (from the Plane of Water) = Ice<br>Rodcet Nife (God of Healing) = Docter Fine (again mispelled).<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Ioshua and Tennian<br><I>"Paging Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard..."</I></font><p><p><IMG SRC="eegg3.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">The full name for "Unrest" is "The Estate of Unrest" - or "A state of unrest," which one could say all of the residents are in.<p><IMG SRC="eegg4.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">In Blackburrow, (and possibly other zones) you can see a fossilized "Alien" skeleton in the walls.  Somehow, I think Ripley would approve. <p><IMG SRC="eegg2.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Apparently one of the programmers wanted to immortalize his cat.  In an area underneath Befallen (a place only GMs go normally, however players and some mobs sometimes end up there as well), you will see the head of this programmer's cat.<br>As an added bonus, I've been told that this cat's name is Mitty - which just also happens to be the name of a Kerran (cat-person) in Erud's Crossing.  <A HREF="catroom.gif">Picture!</A><br><font size=-2>Thanks to Josh Ward</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg5.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">The Innothule swamp is easy enough to figure out - Innoruuk + Cazic-Thule = Innothule.  Love this new math ;) <br><font size=-2>Thanks to Thomas Skaggs and Void* of Fennin Ro</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg6.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">In Neriak, there's a store called the Silk Underground.  It's just possible that this is a reference to the Velvet Underground, a popular band in the eighties(?). <br><font size=-2>Thanks to J Branch</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg4.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">In the Qeynos sewers there is graffiti that says 'Aradune is stinky'  I wonder if Brad knew about this ahead of time?<P><IMG SRC="eegg5.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">In nearly every inn and tavern across Norrath, there is a picture of "things" playing poker - where the things are a play on the name of the place.  For example, Crow's in Qeynos has crows playing poker, while Tassel's in Freeport has tassels playing poker.  They are a tribute to the famous "Dogs Playing Poker" series of paintings by Cassius Marcellus Coolidge (circa 1910's).<p><IMG SRC="eegg3.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Remote Halas, home of the Barbarians, is still not remote enough to be safe from the ego of at least on programmer.  Belly up to McQuaid's Bar for a bottle of smug, or a shot of gloat.<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Tamboran Ratamacue, History Filidh of the Soerbaird</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg1.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Paineel is also rife with humour - check out Good Iva's Sweets (like Godiva Chocolates...)  To bad there's not a naked lady on a horse there...<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Josh Ward</font><p><IMG SRC="eeggnew.gif" HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALT="NEW!!!">Also in Paineel, there's the Bank called "The Dead Reckoning."  Now, this term has two meanings - the older refers to navigating in heavy fog (perhaps a "fog bank?"), while the more recent has to do with a programming technique to reduce lag.  Whether that is present in the game remains to be seen.<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Gruns Spreke</font><p><!--***************************************************************************--><hr><H2>Things</H2>In the realm of the truly bizarre, EverQuest programmers would be kings.  These are some of the various little gems hidden in different things around Norrath.<p><IMG SRC="eegg1.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">In Dagnor's Cauldron, there are four NPC's that hang around a campsite. When the High Elf in the party attacks, he shouts "Fabulous Four, attack!"  The Dwarf in the party attacks, he says, "It's bashing time!" <br><font size=-2>Thanks in part to Steve Bryson</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg2.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">The runes on the side of the Qeynos watchtower can be translated - but you have to know runic, and they're spelled backwards.  The inside ring spells out Qeynos, while the outer ring spells out Ak'anon Gnomes.<p><IMG SRC="eegg3.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">The phrase to say to Kizdean Gix to get the note for Lrodd is "utalk adarev otcin". This is a misspelling of the quote from the movie, "The Day the Earth Stood Still."  The words spelled backwards are "klatu verada nicto", which is close to the actual quote: "Klaatu barada nikto".  Now, I've gotten about a million "corrections" to this - <B>*YES*</B>, Ash, did say it in "Army of Darkness."  But Sam Raimi, writer/producer/director of the whole "Evil Dead" series, got it from "The Day the Earth Stood Still."<br><Font size=-2><I>"Klaatu borada n... Necktie... Nickel... It's an "N" word, it's definitely an "N" word!"</I></font><p><IMG SRC="eegg4.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">In South Karana, you will find a Putrid Skeleton that says "Never fear...Smyth isss...Here!!" This, of course, being a reference to Dr. Smith's line in "Lost in Space," the movie. <A HREF="smyth.jpg">Picture!</A><p><IMG SRC="eegg6.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Charm a griffon.  Tell it <B>/pet sit down</B>.  Laugh.  Incidentally, this also works with numerous other mobs.  Go ahead, have a charming day ;)<p><IMG SRC="eegg5.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">If you kill lizardmen in the Lost Temple of Cazic-Thule, you get faction adjustments with two strange groups: "Allize Taeew" and "Allize Volew".  Backwards they're "We love Zilla" and "We eate Zilla". Hrm.  Little spelling problem there ;)  My assumption is that they refer to the Godzilla - a really large lizard.  You can find a nearly-life size replica in the Ocean of Tears - going by the name of Allizewasaur.<br>  <FONT size=-2>Thanks to Brandon Baker and Deene Crystalis!</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg4.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Lady Shae, who hangs out in Hogcaller's Inn in West Freeport, would like to know what [house] you are in.  Tell her you're from the International House of Pancakes...  She says, "I can tell, it looks like you ate a house of pancakes!"  <A HREF="ladyshae.gif">Picture!</A><br>  <FONT size=-2>Thanks to Sean Rhea and Andrew Kugelstadt!</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg3.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Who would have thought TWO people would have invented the oh-so-tasty treat, "Lizard-on-a-stick"?  No one - that's why it's an inside joke!  But if you've ever played Fallout or Fallout 2, you are probably familiar with this amazing delicacy.<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Grnadd Fleshwound - whom I believe invented the recipe ;)</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg1.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Dill Fireshine is obviously a fan of the Fire Beatles - after all, he calls the Crushbone Orcs "Blue meanies" - which just happens to be the same name as the creatures the Beatles are fleeing in the movie "The Yellow Submarine."<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Nils Hedglin!</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg2.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Gearheart, a gnomish clockwork in Lesser Faydark, must be a big Lost in Space fan - when he attacks, he shouts "Danger, Princess Jolina, Danger!"<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Vexxor!</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg6.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">This one is very much not-confirmed, but I am told that there are a two NPCs, a female Barbarian, Lenka Stoutheart, and Bronto Thudfoot, her male Ogre Paladin companion, who speak of making the "Kunark Run" in their vessel, the "Blue Beast."  The way they speak of it is reminiscent of Han Solo's comments about the Millenium Falcon in "Star Wars IV: A New Hope."<br>Incidentally, I recently saw them in Firiona Vie, as well, so I guess they DO make the run!<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Kailyn Longstride and Rémi Tippetts</font><p><IMG SRC="eegg4.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Guard Cheslin in the Qeynos Hills is a bit of an irresponsible lout - always dropping his cards all over the place.  You see, it seems that he plays a game called "Illusion" - which is similar to "Magic: The Gathering" - even down to the names.  A couple of examples: Ebon Lotus = Black Lotus, and Library of Erud = Library of Alexandria.<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Somaa Vayu</font><p><p><IMG SRC="eeggnew.gif" HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALT="NEW!!!">Rivervale Deputies are right proud of their duds - in fact, if you complement them ("Nice hat!" or "Nice mask!") they'll tell you just how proud!<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Demitri0</font><p><table><TR><TD><a href="http://home.netscape.com/"><img src="../bards/aninet30.gif" align="middle" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=31 WIDTH=88 alt="View me with Netscape !"></a></TD><TD><center><font size=-1>Page maintained by <A HREF="mailto:snicker@pinkpig.com">Talies the Wanderer</A><br> And special thanks to <A HREF="http://www.locksley.com/">Ioseph of Locksley</A>, without whose constant inspiration to Bards everywhere, this page never would have been.</center></font></TD><TD><a href = "http://www.hippie98.com/"><img border=0 src="../bards/hiptag98.gif" align="middle" alt="Created with Hippie!" width=105 height=35></a></TD></TR></table><p><CENTER><HR></CENTER><p><a href="http://www.pinkpig.com/" target="new"><img src="../animbutton.gif" height=87 width=108 alt="pinkpig.com" border = 0 > Hosting by PinkPig</a> - Unlimited Dialup Access only $14.95/month!<p><IMG SRC="http://www2.pinkpig.com/counter.count$amtgard/easterquest/font=brush" alt = "counter"></BODY></HTML>
