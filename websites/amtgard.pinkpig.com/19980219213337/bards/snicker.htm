said,<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt="" width=2 height=1> "Ye live to be livin' and not to be dead."<p>"But, Da," he cried, "that canna be it."<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt="" width=2 height=1>  His Da just said "Hush, and listen a bit.<br>"I've said what I meant and I meant what I've said,<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt="" width=2 height=1>  "Ye live to be livin' and not to be dead."<br><ul>   "Ye

die!</ul><p> The boy was not happy, he had to know why,<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt="" width=2 height=1>  The sun rose each morning, and lit up the sky.<br>The grass liked the rain, and the birds liked to fly,<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt="" width=2 height=1>  He couldn't be happy until he knew why.<br><p> The question it plagued him, it wouldn't let go.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt="" width=2

eyes.<br><p> The wizened old man, the boy went to see,<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt="" width=2 height=1>  And posed him the question, "Sir, why d'we be?"<br>His grandfather dyin', his last words he said,<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt="" width=2 height=1>  "Ye live to be livin', boy, not to be dead."<br><br><ul>   "Ye live to be livin' and not to be dead,<br>   "Just makin' the most out of life's

width=2 height=1> Children were born, only to die.<br>Wars would be lost while battles were won,<br> <IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt="" width=2 height=1> He sought for the answer, there had to be one.<br><p> Many years later, he lived all alone,<br> <IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt="" width=2 height=1> His wife had passed on, his children were grown.<br>But once in a while, they'd visit and see,<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt="" width=2 height=1>  And ask him the question, "Da, why d'we be?"<br><p>  For all of his life, that question had burned.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt="" width=2
