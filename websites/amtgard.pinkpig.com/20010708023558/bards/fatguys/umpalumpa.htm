He started the first verse, I just followed the thread. Since I became Vicar of Knight’s crossing, I have been getting PHONE CALLS. I expected them from the local group, but many of these are coming from folks from outside of the Barony. It is a constant source of amusement. Some people just take things too seriously. Most of the calls are trivial, but these folks are seeing plots everywhere. If I had the same amount of imagination, I could be a best-selling fiction writer. Anyway this song is a call to lighten up.   <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="pelicancan.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (A Pelican Can)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="aschmoozing.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Four Fat Guys Went a-Schmoozing...)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">104</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
