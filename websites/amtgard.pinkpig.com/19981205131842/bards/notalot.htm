" (or something like that) "... you will find a large pileof broken, discarded pewter ale tankards. Collect as many as you canand bring them back here and I shall fashion them into armour for youfor free."<p>So, Sir Notalot went to the inn and collected all the pewter mugs hecould carry and took them back to the armourer. This good man thenproceeded to batter the tankards flat and hang them on strings aroundSir Notalot's neck until his whole body was covered. The only problemwas that Sir Notalot *clanked* at every step.<p>Sir Notalot walked back to the court - (clankity-clank, clankity-clank)all the way. He walked into King Arthur's presence to show off his newarmour and the King said "That will do, I suppose, but you need a finecharger to ride with the other knights when they leave tomorrow"<p>Sir Notalot then went to the stables (clankity-clank, clankity-clank) to see what he could ride. The stablemaster said "Well, I have thisfine white charger at 100 livres or this slightly smaller dappled mareat 80 livres, or this broken down old nag for 60 livres."<p>Sir Notalot said "What have you got for 3 livres? That is all I haveand I must leave with the other knights tomorrow"<p>The stablemaster thought for a moment and said "Well, I do have thisflea-bitten Saint Bernard which has recently been reprocessed sincethe former owner couldn't keep up with the brandy consumption - willthat do?"<p>Sir Notalot paid over the money, jumped onto the dog's back andgalloped back to the King - dragging his feet in the dust as he went,with his armour clanking along (draggity-clank, draggity-clank).<p>He reached the King, who said "The others have already headed off tothe east."<p>So, Sir Notalot charged out on his St Bernard, clanking and dragginghis feet (clankity-drag, clankity-drag). At that point it started torain and the water ran inside the hammered pewter pots and down SirNotalot's legs (clankity-slosh, clankity-slosh), soaking the Saint Bernard as well. The rain became so heavy that the road started to flood and the clankity-slosh noise became more of a sort of a clankity-sploosh noise (clankity-sploosh, clankity-sploosh). And thenthe thunder and lighting started (*BOOM*). Eventually, Sir Notalotreached the inn where the other knights had stopped for a rest. Herode up to the door (clankity-sploosh, clankity-sploosh) and said tothe inn-keeper "Hail, inn-keeper" (since it was hailing by now) "Haveyou a room?"<p>And the inn-keeper said "No chance - I am full with theseroundish-tablers."<p>In despair, Sir Notalot pleaded "But surely you have somewhere I canshelter from the storm?" and pointing to his bedraggled Saint Bernardhe said:<p>          <center><b>"You wouldn't send a knight out on a dog like this?"</b></center><p><a href="index.html"><IMG SRC="back2bards_bw.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=96 WIDTH=132 ALT="Back to the Bard's Guild."></a></td></tr></table></body></html>
