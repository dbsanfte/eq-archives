to like girls,<BR>         I'd play with their corsets and fondle their curls.<BR>         'Till one day, she ran off with a Scotsman named Bruce,<BR>         Now you'd never get treated that way by a moose.<BR><BR>         CHORUS<BR>         Moose, moose, I likes a moose,                     <BR>         I've never had anything quite like a moose.        <BR>         I've had lots of lovers, my life has been loose,   <BR>        But I've never had anything quite like a moose.    <BR><BR>        Now when I'm in need of a very good lay,<BR>        I go to my closet and get me some hay.<BR>        I go to my window and spread it around.<BR>        'Cause moose always come when there's hay on the ground.<BR><BR>        Gorillas are all right on Saturday night,<BR>        Lions and tigers, they puts up a fight.<BR>        But it's just not the same when you slam your caboose,<BR>        As the feeling you get when you humps with a moose.<BR><BR>        I've done it with beasties with long flowing hair,<BR>        I'd do it with snakes if their fangs were not there.<BR>        I've done it with walrus, a monkey, and goose,<BR>        But it's just not the same when you screw with a moose.<BR><BR>I've tried many beasties on land or on sea<BR>I've even tried hump-backs that humped back on me!<BR>Sharks are quite good, tho they're hard to pull loose<BR>But on dry land there is nothing quite like a moose.<BR><BR>Woodchucks are all right, except that they bite<BR>And foxes and rabbits won't last throught the night!<BR>Cows would be fun, but they're hard to seduce,<BR>But you never need worry should you find a moose.<BR><BR>Step in my study, and trophies you'll find;<BR>A black striped tiget and scruffy maned lion.<BR>You'll know the elephant by his ivory tooth,<BR>And the one that's a-winking, you know is the moose.<BR><BR>The lion succumbed to a thirty-ought-six,<BR>Machine guns and tigers, I've proved do not mix.<BR>The elephant fell by a bomb with a fuse,<BR>But I won't tell a soul how I did in the moose.<BR><BR>I've found many women attracted to me.<BR>A few of them have had me over for tea.<BR>Some say that they love me when they're feeling loose,<BR>But I'd trade the world's women for one lovely moose!<BR><BR>The good Lord made Adam, and then he made Eve.<BR>Said He: "If you sin now, Ill ask you to leave."<BR>They left not because of Eve's forbidden fruit,<BR>But 'cause Adam decided the moose there were cute.<BR><BR>The English are said to like boars who've had corn.<BR>The Celtics just dream of the young Unicorn.<BR>The German's, it's said, just need leather and rope,<BR>But give me a moose and I'll no longer mope.<BR><BR>Now I've broken the laws in this God-awful state.<BR>They've put me in prison and locked up the gate.<BR>They say that tomorrow I'll swing from a noose<BR>But my last night I'll spend with a good sexy moose.<BR><BR>Next morning the Governor's word reached my ears,<BR>"We've commuted your sentence to ninety nine years!"<BR>"You won't get parole, not a five minute's truce,<BR>And your friend goes to Sing-Sing, he's so big-a-moose!"<BR><BR> Now that I'm old and advanced in my years,<BR> I look back on my life and shed me no tears.<BR> As I sit in my chair with my glass of Mateuse,<BR>Playing Hide-The-Salami with Melba the Moose.<BR><A HREF="#top">Top of Page</A>   <BR><BR><STRONG> <H2><A NAME="venus">The Good Ship Venus</A></H2></STRONG>                                                                                      It was on the good ship Venus,<BR>By Christ you should have seen us;<BR>The figurehead was a whore in bed<BR>Astride a rampant penis.<BR><BR>(Chorus)<BR>     Frigging in the rigging, <BR>    Frigging in the rigging<BR>    We're frigging in the rigging <BR>    'cos there's nothing else to do.<BR><BR>It was at the China Station<BR>By way of celebration<BR>We sunk a junk with jets of spunk<BR>By mutual masturbation.<BR><BR>We sailed to the Canaries<BR>To screw the local faeries;<BR>We got the Syph in Tenerife<BR>And the clap in Buenos Aires.<BR><BR>We sailed to the Bahamas<BR>Where the girls all wear pajamas;<BR>They wouldn't screw our motley crew - <BR>They much preferred bananas.<BR><BR>The captains' name was Mugger,<BR>A dirty-minded bugger;<BR>He wasn't fit to shovel shit<BR>From one deck to the other.<BR><BR>The first mate's name was Morgan,<BR>A homosexual Gorgon;<BR>Six men could ride with legs astride<BR>Upon his sexual organ.<BR><BR>The second mate's name was Abel;<BR>His arsehole bore this label:<BR>I'll give the crew their daily due,<BR>Though I'm no Betty Grable.<BR><BR>The third mate's name was Walter,<BR>At love he'd never falter.<BR>The bloody stiff had given syph <BR>To all the girls in Malta.<BR><BR>The stoker was McGuire,<BR>He really was a trier,<BR>For though on shore he kept a whore,<BR>On board he pulled his wire.<BR><BR>The stewards' name was Topper; <BR>Boy, did he have a whopper!<BR>Twice round the deck, once round his neck<BR>And up his arse for a stopper.<BR><BR>The bosuns' name was Andy,<BR>A bastard bald and randy;<BR>They filled his bum with boiling rum<BR>For pissing in the brandy.<BR><BR>But the bosuns' plan was prosperous,<BR>He dipped his cock in phosphorous;<BR>All through the night it kept alight<BR>To guide us through the Bosporous.<BR><BR>The pursers name was Lester;<BR>He was a hymen tester;<BR>Through hymens' thick he'd shove his prick<BR>And leave it there to fester.<BR><BR>That purser came from Wigan;<BR>By God he had a big'un!<BR>We bashed his cock with a lump of rock <BR>For frigging in the rigging.<BR><BR>The fireman was McTavish<BR>And young girls he did ravish;<BR>His missing tool's in Istanbul,<BR>He was a trifle lavish.<BR><BR>The carpenter Caruthers,<BR>Beloved of all the others;<BR>He wasn't quite a hermaphrodite,<BR>But a mistake of his mothers.<BR><BR>The engineer McPherson<BR>To snatch had an aversion,<BR>So he stuck his cock up a water-cock,<BR>A peculiar perversion!<BR><BR>The musicians' name was Carter;<BR>He tuned his arse as a farter.<BR>He could play anything from God Save The King<BR>To Beethoven's' Moonlight Sonata.<BR><BR>The cooks' name was O'Malley,<BR>He didn't dilly-dally;<BR>He shot his bolt with such a jolt<BR>He whitewashed half the galley.<BR><BR>The cook's offsider Riemann,<BR>He was a filthy demon;<BR>He served the crew with a filthy brew<BR>Of foreskins boiled in semen.<BR><BR>A third cooks name was Aiken;<BR>Each morning he'd awaken<BR>To scrape the spunk from off his bunk<BR>To fry the skippers bacon.<BR><BR>The trainee cook was Wooden,<BR>By Christ he was a good'un;<BR>He tossed off twice in a bag of rice <BR>And called it sago puddin'.<BR><BR>The radio operator<BR>He was a masturbator;<BR>To get a jolt he'd shoot his bolt<BR>Across the oscillator.<BR><BR>A stowaway named Tupper<BR>We rubbed his balls with butter;<BR>The charge whizzed past the mizzen mast<BR>And foamed against the scupper.<BR><BR>The stewardess was Dinah.<BR>She sprang a leak off China,<BR>We had to pump poor Dinah's rump<BR>To empty her vagina.<BR><BR>The cabin-boys' name was Nipper,<BR>A dirty little flipper;<BR>They filled his arse with broken glass<BR>And circumcised the skipper.<BR><BR>The ladies of the nation<BR>Arose an indignation<BR>And stuffed his bum with chewing gum<BR>A smart retaliation!<BR><BR>The captains' wife was Mabel,<BR>Always willing and able,<BR>Behind the door, or on the floor,<BR>Or on the chart room table.<BR><BR>The captain had a daughter,<BR>She fell into the water;<BR>Ecstatic squeals revealed that eels<BR>Had found her sexual quarter.<BR><BR>When we put into Calais.<BR>The captains' daughter Sally<BR>Dressed as a whore and rushed ashore<BR>And won the Grand Prix Rally.<BR><BR>Another daughter Charlotte,<BR>She was a filthy harlot.<BR>Her thighs at night were lily-white, <BR>But in the morning scarlet.<BR><BR>The ship's dog name was Rover,<BR>The whole crew did him over;<BR>They ground and ground that poor old hound<BR>From Land's End round to Dover.<BR><BR>The ship's cats name was Kitty, <BR>Her arse was black and shitty;<BR>Her feline twat was kept red hot,<BR>By a crew who knew no pity.<BR><BR>So now we end this serial<BR>From sheer lack of raw material;<BR>We wish you
