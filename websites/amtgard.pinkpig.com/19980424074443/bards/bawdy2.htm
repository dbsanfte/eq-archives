<STRONG> <H2><A NAME="moose"> The Moose Song</A></H2></STRONG>


         When I was a young lad I used to like girls,<BR>
         I'd play with their corsets and fondle their curls.<BR>
         'Till one day, she ran off with a Scotsman named Bruce,<BR>
         Now you'd never get treated that way by a moose.<BR>
<BR>
         CHORUS<BR>
         Moose, moose, I likes a moose,                     <BR>
         I've never had anything quite like a moose.        <BR>
         I've had lots of lovers, my life has been loose,   <BR>
        But I've never had anything quite like a moose.    <BR>
<BR>
        Now when I'm in need of a very good lay,<BR>
        I go to my closet and get me some hay.<BR>
        I go to my window and spread it around.<BR>
        'Cause moose always come when there's hay on the ground.<BR>
<BR>
        Gorillas are all right on Saturday night,<BR>
        Lions and tigers, they puts up a fight.<BR>
        But it's just not the same when you slam your caboose,<BR>
        As the feeling you get when you humps with a moose.<BR>
<BR>
        I've done it with beasties with long flowing hair,<BR>
        I'd do it with snakes if their fangs were not there.<BR>
        I've done it with walrus, a monkey, and goose,<BR>
        But it's just not the same when you screw with a moose.<BR>
<BR>
I've tried many beasties on land or on sea<BR>
I've even tried hump-backs that humped back on me!<BR>
Sharks are quite good, tho they're hard to pull loose<BR>
But on dry land there is nothing quite like a moose.<BR>
<BR>
Woodchucks are all right, except that they bite<BR>
And foxes and rabbits won't last throught the night!<BR>
Cows would be fun, but they're hard to seduce,<BR>
But you never need worry should you find a moose.<BR>
<BR>
Step in my study, and trophies you'll find;<BR>
A black striped tiget and scruffy maned lion.<BR>
You'll know the elephant by his ivory tooth,<BR>
And the one that's a-winking, you know is the moose.<BR>
<BR>
The lion succumbed to a thirty-ought-six,<BR>
Machine guns and tigers, I've proved do not mix.<BR>
The elephant fell by a bomb with a fuse,<BR>
But I won't tell a soul how I did in the moose.<BR>
<BR>
I've found many women attracted to me.<BR>
A few of them have had me over for tea.<BR>
Some say that they love me when they're feeling loose,<BR>
But I'd trade the world's women for one lovely moose!<BR>
<BR>
The good Lord made Adam, and then he made Eve.<BR>
Said He: "If you sin now, Ill ask you to leave."<BR>
They left not because of Eve's forbidden fruit,<BR>
But 'cause Adam decided the moose there were cute.<BR>
<BR>
The English are said to like boars who've had corn.<BR>
The Celtics just dream of the young Unicorn.<BR>
The German's, it's said, just need leather and rope,<BR>
But give me a moose and I'll no longer mope.<BR>
<BR>
Now I've broken the laws in this God-awful state.<BR>
They've put me in prison and locked up the gate.<BR>
They say that tomorrow I'll swing from a noose<BR>
But my last night I'll spend with a good sexy moose.<BR>
<BR>
Next morning the Governor's word reached my ears,<BR>
"We've commuted your sentence to ninety nine years!"<BR>
"You won't get parole, not a five minute's truce,<BR>
And your friend goes to Sing-Sing, he's so big-a-moose!"<BR>
<BR>
 Now that I'm old and advanced in my years,<BR>
 I look back on my life and shed me no tears.<BR>
 As I sit in my chair with my glass of Mateuse,<BR>
Playing Hide-The-Salami with Melba the Moose.<BR>

<STRONG> <H2><A NAME="venus">The Good Ship Venus</A></H2></STRONG>                                                                                      
It was on the good ship Venus,<BR>
By Christ you should have seen us;<BR>
The figurehead was a whore in bed<BR>
Astride a rampant penis.<BR>
<BR>
(Chorus)<BR>
     Frigging in the rigging, <BR>
    Frigging in the rigging<BR>
    We're frigging in the rigging <BR>
    'cos there's nothing else to do.<BR>
<BR>
It was at the China Station<BR>
By way of celebration<BR>
We sunk a junk with jets of spunk<BR>
By mutual masturbation.<BR>
<BR>
We sailed to the Canaries<BR>
To screw the local faeries;<BR>
We got the Syph in Tenerife<BR>
And the clap in Buenos Aires.<BR>
<BR>
We sailed to the Bahamas<BR>
Where the girls all wear pajamas;<BR>
They wouldn't screw our motley crew - <BR>
They much preferred bananas.<BR>
<BR>
The captains' name was Mugger,<BR>
A dirty-minded bugger;<BR>
He wasn't fit to shovel shit<BR>
From one deck to the other.<BR>
<BR>
The first mate's name was Morgan,<BR>
A homosexual Gorgon;<BR>
Six men could ride with legs astride<BR>
Upon his sexual organ.<BR>
<BR>
The second mate's name was Abel;<BR>
His arsehole bore this label:<BR>
I'll give the crew their daily due,<BR>
Though I'm no Betty Grable.<BR>
<BR>
The third mate's name was Walter,<BR>
At love he'd never falter.<BR>
The bloody stiff had given syph <BR>
To all the girls in Malta.<BR>
<BR>
The stoker was McGuire,<BR>
He really was a trier,<BR>
For though on shore he kept a whore,<BR>
On board he pulled his wire.<BR>
<BR>
The stewards' name was Topper; <BR>
Boy, did he have a whopper!<BR>
Twice round the deck, once round his neck<BR>
And up his arse for a stopper.<BR>
<BR>
The bosuns' name was Andy,<BR>
A bastard bald and randy;<BR>
They filled his bum with boiling rum<BR>
For pissing in the brandy.<BR>
<BR>
But the bosuns' plan was prosperous,<BR>
He dipped his cock in phosphorous;<BR>
All through the night it kept alight<BR>
To guide us through the Bosporous.<BR>
<BR>
The pursers name was Lester;<BR>
He was a hymen tester;<BR>
Through hymens' thick he'd shove his prick<BR>
And leave it there to fester.<BR>
<BR>
That purser came from Wigan;<BR>
By God he had a big'un!<BR>
We bashed his cock with a lump of rock <BR>
For frigging in the rigging.<BR>
<BR>
The fireman was McTavish<BR>
And young girls he did ravish;<BR>
His missing tool's in Istanbul,<BR>
He was a trifle lavish.<BR>
<BR>
The carpenter Caruthers,<BR>
Beloved of all the others;<BR>
He wasn't quite a hermaphrodite,<BR>
But a mistake of his mothers.<BR>
<BR>
The engineer McPherson<BR>
To snatch had an aversion,<BR>
So he stuck his cock up a water-cock,<BR>
A peculiar perversion!<BR>
<BR>
The musicians' name was Carter;<BR>
He tuned his arse as a farter.<BR>
He could play anything from God Save The King<BR>
To Beethoven's' Moonlight Sonata.<BR>
<BR>
The cooks' name was O'Malley,<BR>
He didn't dilly-dally;<BR>
He shot his bolt with such a jolt<BR>
He whitewashed half the galley.<BR>
<BR>
The cook's offsider Riemann,<BR>
He was a filthy demon;<BR>
He served the crew with a filthy brew<BR>
Of foreskins boiled in semen.<BR>
<BR>
A third cooks name was Aiken;<BR>
Each morning he'd awaken<BR>
To scrape the spunk from off his bunk<BR>
To fry the skippers bacon.<BR>
<BR>
The trainee cook was Wooden,<BR>
By Christ he was a good'un;<BR>
He tossed off twice in a bag of rice <BR>
And called it sago puddin'.<BR>
<BR>
The radio operator<BR>
He was a masturbator;<BR>
To get a jolt he'd shoot his bolt<BR>
Across the oscillator.<BR>
<BR>
A stowaway named Tupper<BR>
We rubbed his balls with butter;<BR>
The charge whizzed past the mizzen mast<BR>
And foamed against the scupper.<BR>
<BR>
The stewardess was Dinah.<BR>
She sprang a leak off China,<BR>
We had to pump poor Dinah's rump<BR>
To empty her vagina.<BR>
<BR>
The cabin-boys' name was Nipper,<BR>
A dirty little flipper;<BR>
They filled his arse with broken glass<BR>
And circumcised the skipper.<BR>
<BR>
The ladies of the nation<BR>
Arose an indignation<BR>
And stuffed his bum with chewing gum<BR>
A smart retaliation!<BR>
<BR>
The captains' wife was Mabel,<BR>
Always willing and able,<BR>
Behind the door, or on the floor,<BR>
Or on the chart room table.<BR>
<BR>
The captain had a daughter,<BR>
She fell into the water;<BR>
Ecstatic squeals revealed that eels<BR>
Had found her sexual quarter.<BR>
<BR>
When we put into Calais.<BR>
The captains' daughter Sally<BR>
Dressed as a whore and rushed ashore<BR>
And won the Grand Prix Rally.<BR>
<BR>
Another daughter Charlotte,<BR>
She was a filthy harlot.<BR>
Her thighs at night were lily-white, <BR>
But in the morning scarlet.<BR>
<BR>
The ship's dog name was Rover,<BR>
The whole crew did him over;<BR>
They ground and ground that poor old hound<BR>
From Land's End round to Dover.<BR>
<BR>
The ship's cats name was Kitty, <BR>
Her arse was black and shitty;<BR>
Her feline twat was kept red hot,<BR>
By a crew who knew no pity.<BR>
<BR>
So now we end this serial<BR>
From sheer lack of raw material;<BR>
We wish you luck, whenever you fuck<BR>
From all disease Venereal.<BR>

<STRONG> <H2><A NAME="roll">Roll Your Leg Over</A></H2></STRONG> 
 
         If all the young ladies were little white rabbits<BR>
         I'd be a hare and I'd teach 'em bad habits<BR>
<BR>
CHORUS   <BR>
Roll your leg over, roll your leg over    <BR>
                   Roll your leg over the man in the moon<BR>
<BR>
         If all the young ladies were bricks in a pile<BR>
         I'd be a mason and lay them in style<BR>
<BR>
         If all the young laddies were cocks in the hay<BR>
         I'd be a hen and I'd have a good lay<BR>
<BR>
         If all the young ladies were bats in a steeple<BR>
         And I were a bat there'd be more bats than people<BR>
<BR>
         If all the young ladies were bells in a tower<BR>
         And I were a clapper I'd bang every hour<BR>
<BR>
         If all the young laddies were fine silks and laces<BR>
         And I were an iron I'd sit on their faces<BR>
<BR>
         If all the young ladies were doors of stout wood<BR>
         And I were a knocker I'd bang 'em up good<BR>
<BR>
         If all the young ladies were stones in a mill<BR>
         And I were some grain, between them I'd spill<BR>
<BR>
         If all the young laddies were coconuts sweet<BR>
         I'd suck out their juices and chew on their meat<BR>
<BR>
         If all the young ladies were winds of the sea<BR>
         I'd be a sail and I'd let them blow me<BR>
<BR>
         If all the young ladies were birds in their nests<BR>
         I'd be an egg and lie under their breasts<BR>
<BR>
         If all the young laddies were merry go rounds<BR>
         I'd mount up and we'd go up and down<BR>
<BR>
         If all the young ladies were locks on a gate<BR>
         I'd be a key and insert and rotate<BR>
<BR>
         If all the young ladies were pure as they say<BR>
         All the young men would be happy and gay<BR>
<BR>
         If all the young laddies were big wooden stairs<BR>
         They'd go up mine and I'd go down theirs<BR>
<BR>
         If all the young ladies were bottles of brew<BR>
         I'd pop their tops with my built in corkscrew<BR>
<BR>
         If all the young laddies were bottles of beer<BR>
         I'd give good head and they'd be of good cheer<BR>
<BR>
         If all the young ladies were sweet fruits and berries<BR>
         I'd munch on melons and nibble on cherries<BR>
<BR>
         If all the young ladies were singing this song<BR>
It would be twice as dirty and three times as long,<BR>
