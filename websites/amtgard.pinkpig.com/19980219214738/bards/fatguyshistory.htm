At the Double Warsin Sweden in 1994, myself and several other Americans working in Germanyattended. Now if you have ever had a run in with the authenticity police,imagine an event with over 200 APs running around for a whole week. TheSwedes play with gusto. Their encampments are the most period that I haveseen anywhere. If you don't have a period tent, you have to set up inanother area. Most of the Swedes had never seen or encountered the SCAAmerican style. Many thought that they had invented it. But the mainelement that we noticed was that they were taking the game and themselvesMUCH TOO SERIOUSLY. <br><img src="tab.gif" alt=" ">Interject into this environment five middle-aged Americans, getting wide around the middle who had been playing the game forever. (I started playingback in 1974). We interjected some comic relief into the event. They didn'tquite know what to think about us when we set up our plastic tents andColeman stove. They did notice that we were having too much fun and as theweek went by more and more of the folks were coming to our encampment. <br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">About halfway through the event, they had a four man melee tournament.Each team had to come up with a name. As you can imagine, most of theSwedes took these serious, macho sounding, manly names, like the Red Death,or the Sharks. Well when asked what our name would be we chose "Four FatGuys". On the bridge battles we devistated them. We came in second in thetourney. During the wars, if they needed a shield wall broken the cry was"Send in the Fat Guys!"  The name stuck. For the rest of the event we wereknown as the "Fat Guys." By the end of the event we had come up thedefinition of living large. Thats how it started. The only official statuswe have is the right to impose a beer tax at all feasts in the kingdom aslong as we insure that the King will never go dry. We also host a "Beer PitTourney" at the Double Wars. Each entrant has to bring a beer to enter,Squires must bring two,  and Knights, a sixpack. The winner of the tourney gets all thebeer. We are known to ask the King quite publicly "Is this going to be aone, two, ... or six beer court?" <p>Check out the <a href="http://www.silyn.net/~bowerst/fatguy.htm">Fat Guy Home Page</a> to see <A HREF="mailto:bowerst@silyn.net">Helm&uuml;t von Dornheim's</A> tale of the Fat Guys.<p></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom" width=90><center><a href="fatguys.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Back." border=0><br>Back to the Fat Guy's Songbook</a></center><br><img src="tab.gif" height=1 width=90 alt=" "></td><td><img src="tab.gif" height=1 width=15 alt=" "></TD><td><center><HR width="80%"></center><center><h3>Explanations of the Fat Guy Songs</h3></center><A NAME="axel.htm"></A><p><center><h4>The Tale of Sir Axel</h4></center><p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">In Germany the word "Ausfart" means "EXIT" and is postedon all freeway exits. The word "Umlitung" means "Detour". Back in 1984 SirAxel in court asked the visting King of the East (Drachenwald was aprincipality back then) to go a quest to find the Holy Grail. He wasconvinced it was in the town of Ausfart. From there on the Ballad explainsitself. <A NAME="obese"></a><p><center><h4>Obese</h4></center><p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" "> A Fat Guy tabard is green with a gold mug. The handle of the muggoes under the shield (to protect it). If the Fat Guy is a King or Prince(or Count, Earl, etc.) he can put foam on top of the mug. We've had a few. <A NAME="blackleaf"></a><p><center><h4>Ballad of Blackleaf.</h4></center> <p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">Baron Matthew Blackleaf - one the first four Fat Guys. He first Viceroy of the Crown Principality of Nordmark (Sweden) and will be King of Drachenwaldthis Jan. He didn't learn.<A NAME="cookie"></A><p><center><h4>Cookie Wars</h4></center> <p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">An event held every summer in Germany. It is always aroundsome kind of cookie theme. This song was written the morning after as I gazed at the broken cookie crumbs and empty beer bottles. It wrote itself. <A NAME="3drunk"></A><p><center><h4>Three Drunken Fat Guys</h4></center> <p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">Pretty much happened as the song went. In 1996Michael of Aquitane (another of the original four and the one who came upwith the name) was made a Queen's Companion being described at thepersonification chivalry and Grace in the Kingdom (You have to have met himto understand why half the kingdom was rolling on the floor). The King andQueen were trying hard to make us respectable. They didn't. <A NAME="thumper"></A><p><center><h4>Thumper</h4></center><p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" "> One of the fat guys, Friedrich Karl von Wolfstein,  fights with a huge two handed war hammer. In wars he likes to hide in tree and jump out and pound people with it. One of Michael of Aquitane's more notorious doings was to cheer on a friend in acrown tourney - shouting "Pound him into the ground like a tent peg into agrape". After his friend won and became king he augmented Michael's armsto a tent peg going through a grape. <A NAME="helmut"></A><p><center><h4>Helm&uuml;t's Home Brew </h4></center><p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" "> One Fat Guy, Helm&uuml;t von Dornheim,  makes cordials of really strange combinations.(He still hasn't gotten his Baloney Schnapps right yet). Hehas a warning label on the back of each bottle with the warning in thesong. <A NAME="knaeckebroed"></A><p><center><h4>Oh Knaeckebroed</h4></center> <p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">This is a hard flat bread that has holes on one side andis flat on the back. One of the Double Wars in Sweden is the KnaeckebroedWar. It is fought to determine which side of the bread will be buttered atall events for the next year. They get very passionate about the subject upthere. <A NAME="garick"></A><p><center><h4>Count Garick's Tale of Woe<br>and<br>Where has all the Count's Beer Gone?</h4></center><p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">At last years Beer Pit Tourney, Count Garickwas the winner. There was a stream running through the sites, and he builta small dam and put his winnings there. It rained that night and it allwashed away into a lake (at least a case and half). He only recovered onebeer. <a name="elffin"></A><p><center><h4>Duke Elffin, Duchess Vanna</h4></center><p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">The first King and Queen, and now Duke andDuchess of Drachenwald. Back at our first crown tourney, Elffin had justarrived in Europe from Australia. He was knight at the time and got awaiver to allow him to fight in crown. He did not have a Lady, and askedthe person he was staying with if she knew a suitable Lady he could fightfor. They called up Vanna and she agreed to let him fight for her. None ofthem had ever seen him fight, and did not expect him to win. Vanna was notable to make it the tourney, and got a suprising phone call telling herthat she was now Queen. During his first reign, he was constantly startinghis sentences "In the West we..". <a name="feathers"></A><p><center><h4>White Feathers/Blue Feathers</h4></center><p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" ">When I heard about a group of SCAdianswearing white feathers to show that did not want adult jokes or storiestold around them, the song just wrote itself.<p></td></tr></table></font></body></html>
