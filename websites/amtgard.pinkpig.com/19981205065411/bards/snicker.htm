die!</ul><p> The boy was not happy, he had to know why,<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt="" width=2 height=1>  The sun rose each morning, and lit up the sky.<br>The grass liked the rain, and the birds liked to fly,<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt="" width=2 height=1>  He couldn't be happy until he knew why.<br><p> The question it plagued him, it wouldn't let go.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt="" width=2

eyes.<br><p> The wizened old man, the boy went to see,<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt="" width=2 height=1>  And posed him the question, "Sir, why d'we be?"<br>His grandfather dyin', his last words he
