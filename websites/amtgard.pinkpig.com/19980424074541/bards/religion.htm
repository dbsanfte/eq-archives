I hear Valkyries a-comin                There are people into Voodoo
In the air their song is comin          there are people into Voodoo

But they're good enough for me!         and it's good enough for me!

We will venerate Bubastis             We will read from the Kabahlah

Though she's pretty wild and flighty    We will all sing Hare Krishna

And she's good enough for me!           But it's good enough for me!

It was good enough for Loki         We will all go to Nirvana

Here's to those who copy Conan    There will be a lot of lovin
Here's to those who copy Conan    when we're meetin in our Coven

and that's good enough for me!    So there's room enough for me!

We will have a mighty Party           It was good enough for Sappho
In the honor of Astarte               With her lady on her lap-o

'Cause she's good enough for me!      With her pagan poetry!

Shall we sing a verse for Venus,    Well the Christians all are humming
Of the Gods she is the meanest,     Cause they say their God is coming,
Cause she bit me on my...elbow      Our God came three times this evening
And it's good enough for me.        And that's good enough for me.

We will worship like the Druids,      Some guys have a circumcision

Montezuma liked to start out             There's that lusty old Priapus 
Rites by carrying a part out             He's just itching to unwrap us.

But that's good enough for me        which is good enough for me.....!

One-eyed Odin we will follow      We will pray to Zarathustra

Which is good enough for me!      And that's good enough for me!

Hare Krishna gets a laugh on         I'll arise at early mornin'

Well, that's good enough for me!     To know that's right for me!

Lilith wears a lacy nightie        That Bob Larson shrieks and hollers

And that's just fine with me.         They're both too much for me.

Which is good enough for me!           Which is good enough for me!

Then it's good enough for me!        And that's good enough for me!

As the goddess Kali dances           Oh the ancient goddess Nerthus
With her worshippers in trances      From herself the Earth did birth us

And that's good enough for me!       But she's good enough for me!

It was good enough for Venus           We will sing our staves to Venus
She'd have sighed if she'd of seen us  We will sing our staves to Venus
Letting morals come between us         Tho I think this rhyme is henious
And she's good enough for me!          But it's good enough for me!

So they're good enough for me!          And it's good enough for me!

In the church of Aphrodite                 John, Paul, George and Ringo

And she's good enough for me!              And that's good enough for me!
