Drunken people have usually passedout, others have gone to bed, for various reasons,  some actuallyrealize that they need sleep for the next day's activities.  But thelatter crowd is quite few.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Then there are a few who stay up to welcome the new day.  Perhaps theykeep the fire watch and retain the light until the darkness disappears,or maybe they just can't sleep.<p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Three such people have found themselves around a stubborn fire withjust such a predicament.   The fire was dying, and one figure from thethree stood up and walked over to a fallen tree.  He pulled outsomething about the size of a throwing dagger and pressed it with histhumb.  Instantly, the &quot;dagger&quot; flared to life.  Energy crackled out ofthe end of the &quot;dagger&quot; till the total length of the dagger and energywas the length of a saber.  The light emanating from the great energyrevealed the figure to be Donnovan Sunrider, Jedi of the Emerald Hills.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>He raised the saber skyward and then sent it crashing through threelimbs, slicing them cleanly and quickly.  Before they had a chance tofall, he sliced one of the limbs in two yet again, producing four nicesized fire logs.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;This should do nicely.&quot;  Donnovan said almost smugly as he pressed the&quot;dagger&quot; with his thumb yet again, causing the energy and light tocease.  Slipping the dagger looking device in a side holster, heproceeded to pick up the four pieces of firewood.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Show off!&quot;  one figure said from around the fire, hidden in the glowby his cloak and hat.  The cloaked figure pulled himself up to give thejedi a hand with the firewood.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Hey guys, you know, I'm starting to loose feeling in my toes overhere, but that's groovy.  Take your time with the fire wood.&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Now Avice, be thankful we have a jedi here with us.  At least he makes<i>LIGHT</i> of chopping wood.  Hehehehe...&quot;  the cloaked figure punned,revealing himself to be a familiar bardic form in the glimmer of thefire light.<br>	<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>A fourth figure extended a hand out of nowhere (seemingly) and said,&quot;Clu, that definitely needs a pun tax.&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Clu reached into his vest pocket and pulled out a coin,&quot;Here you go Vuzlyn.&quot;  And with that, the hand took the coin andvanished into (seemingly) thin air.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>The bard mused as he helped place the wood on the fire.  &quot;You know, Ithink pun taxes are one of the few things from my less popular newbiedays that I'm glad to say it still alive and well.&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Less popular newbie....?&quot; Donnovan started to say in a voice ofdisbelief.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Clu, I think you have made pun taxes mandatory, that's why they arestill around.&quot;  Avice remarked, still trying to warm up.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;From what I hear, madam bard, you aren't doing so bad yourself.&quot;  Clusaid, smiling at Avice as he placed the last piece of wood on the fire.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Newbie?&quot;  Donnovan remarked again.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Well, we all have to start somewhere.  And believe it or not, therewas a time when I was not considered the bard of bards.  Have I evertold you about Max, the 'Death Bard' of the Emerald Hills?&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;I've heard of him, and no, I don't think you have,&quot;  the jedi said,listening.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Here goes another story....&quot; a voice Vuzlyn groaned from (seemingly)nowhere.  Avice laughed, and settled closer to the fire to listen.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Yeh, we all had to start somewhere,&quot; said Clu, &quot;and that somewhere forme was Ironcloud.... &quot;<p><center><img src="note.gif" height=30 width=582 alt="* * *"></center><p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>It was well after dark, which, when you think about it, was not wisewhen you're in South Dallas.  But we numbered easily a hundred at thatpark; we were young, and having a good time.  Amongst the pitch blackwas a group of people sitting around a picnic bench with a fire going ina Bar-B-Que pit.  <br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>The group was comprised mostly of women who were hanging around Nirvanawaiting for their boyfriends.  As they waited, an older lady, Qinryhrmother of Qintahr the druid, was leading out in a bardic.  The music wasenchanting and already I knew I was going to like the place.  I stood bythe table until the song ended, and then Qinryhr looked at me and said,<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;And who might you be?&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Illure the Messenger.  I have newly arrived after hearing about thesoon to be coronation of the king.&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Imagine that!&quot;  Qinryhr laughed, &quot;A newbie with good garb, now I'veseen everything.&quot;<p> <center><img src="note.gif" height=30 width=582 alt="* * *"></center><p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;What?!?&quot;  the other three voices said from around the fire.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Well, I was dating someone in Amtgard at the time and I thought shewas angry with me.  So I had on a mask and everything.  Unfortunately,the person I was dating, C'Nedra, had a sister known as Weasel, whorecognized me due to the mustache I had at the time.  Very importantlesson, masks and mustaches do not mix well....&quot;<p><center><img src="note.gif" height=30 width=582 alt="* * *"></center><p> 	<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>With my cover blown, I sheepishly looked at Qinryhr and said, &quot;Name'sGoodwyn Clu Da'Bard... famous bard and not so famous fighter.&quot;  whichwas the line I used  in various role playing games before Amtgard.  <br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;A bard, I must say, we don't see many of those here.  Perhaps youwould like to join us for a bardic.&quot;  And with that, she handed me acopy of the Nirvana songbook along with a waiver and various otherthings that are a blur.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Later that night, I would be introduced to Ivan, the king that was soonto be crowned, and his lady Cenza.  Cenza was the first bard I wouldmeet in Amtgard.  The two of them, along with Dawnshadow, would take meover to Ivan's place to have me watch the &quot;Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;(an Ironcloud  initiation for newbies along with various fantasymovies.)  They were loads of fun, and Ivan would give me the first sevenpages to start my songbook and a tape to learn by.   If only he knew the&quot;Neverending Songbook&quot; that would flow from that.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>As they drove me home, a large object burned in the sky and broke intomany flaming pieces that streaked across the sky and in the end, trailedoff over the horizon.  It was a magic that sealed the whole experiencefor me.<p><center><img src="note.gif" height=30 width=582 alt="* * *"></center><p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;What was it?  A meteor?&quot;  Donnovan asked.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Actually, it was a Russian booster rocket re-entering the atmosphere,but we're not supposed to know about that here in  Amtgard of course. Hehehe...  but it was my inspiration for my TARDIS crash landing on thisfantasy world we're on.&quot;<p><center><img src="note.gif" height=30 width=582 alt="* * *"></center><p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>I started coming out because I loved the atmosphere.   There was overa hundred people on the field.  Thirty in Wolfpack, roughly fifteen inSable Pride, thirty in the Corsairs, about fifteen in Argent Moon, androughly 30 in Morterok, the great barbarian company.   Mercenaries andnon-company people, such as myself, numbered easily twenty to thirty.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>First of all, since it was right off of Hampton road (at Kiest park) Ithought the game was called &quot;Hamptgard.&quot;  Secondly, I thought&quot;Hamptgard&quot; was a LOT of people who liked to get together and have funand make up the game as they went.  The people of Ironcloud werecertainly creative enough to improv like that, so I grabbed a long swordand jumped into battle.  But a field with over a hundred people becamequickly confusing with people firing arrows, throwing things, sayingthings.  I don't think I ever died by the sword.  And I got so used tobogus spells that I burst out laughing one day when Sir Garath pulledout a &quot;Sphere of Annihilation&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Now that is the most STUPID sounding spell I've heard all day!!&quot;  AndI laughed all the way back to Nirvana.<p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Nirvana, now there was a great place.  Lots of music, water, andwomen!   I found the life of a &quot;Nirvana Slug&quot; to be a very enjoyablepastime, and had fun learning a lot of the music that I continue singingto this day from people like Qinryhr, C'Nedra, Dawnshadow, and SirAlessandra.  Sir Alessandra was one of the Emerald Hills firstconsistant paladins, and was also the early leader of the bardics.   Shewould inspire me to keep bardics alive.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Three weeks into attending Amtgard, I was appointed court bard of theEmerald Hills when the king was crowned.  I still remember Kal Methwyn'sscowl of disappointment when he heralded my appointment to the populousin court.   Kal and a few others were  hoping that the other bard of theHills would would gain the position.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>One day, I would meet that other bard of the Emerald Hills.&quot;You were wanting to meet another bard, Clu?&quot;  Bloodmoon said to me.&quot;Well, meet Max.&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>I looked where Bloodmoon was pointing, and saw a man who stood about5'8&quot; wielding a shield with a lion on it.  He had a ornate vest, andwore a headband with his long hair.  (I always thought he and Tom Pettylooked fairly similar.)  Maximillan McDonald looked my direction, andwhile still walking said,<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Hi.&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>And continued walking.<p> <IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Since it was the ideal of bards that brought me to Amtgard in the firstplace, and since there were less bards at that time than I had fingerson one hand, I found it great to talk to him.  Over time I would ask himhow he went about playing a bard, what inspired him to play the bardclass, and so forth.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>But it seems the pleasure was all mine.  I was a newbie, he was thirdlevel.  I didn't fight, and I sang with the Nirvana Slugs most of thetime.   Finally one day Max approached Nirvana.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;You call yourself a bard, but you're no bard!  You don't play theclass, you don't wield weapons, and so therefore, you are NOT a bard.&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;What did you say?&quot;  I asked, somewhat stunned.  <br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;I've said what I had to say.&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Max?  We are two different styles of bards.  You like to fight, I liketo sing.  We just see it differently.&quot;<p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>There was no response as Max headed back to the battlefield.  Thepopulous was split on who was more of a bard.  The one who knew hisclass abilities and fought like lightning, or the one who entertained,sang, and portrayed a bard in character. <br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>In time, more and more populous members who could have cared less oneway or the other before, now joined Max in the taunts that I was not abard.  Some were in good fun, others were outright rude.  It wasbecoming quickly apparent, I needed to establish myself as a high levelbard just to have some peace again in Amtgard (and to get everyone offmy back) or simply leave.<p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Max did have a point.  Amtgard does not put much merit in what you doas a character, but who you are on the battlefield and what is recordedon paper.  And so after coming out for nine months to Amtgard,occasionally fighting, singing, helping with the atmosphere of Amtgard,I asked Selka what level I was.   Levels and &quot;abilities&quot; were still amystery to me.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;You have two.&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;I'm second level?!?&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;No, you have two credits.&quot;<p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>After all the time I spent singing in Nirvana, no one told me theimportance of signing in.  After getting some witnesses together toproove various key dates, midreigns and events I had attended, it wasestablished that in the nine months I attended Amtgard, I had amassedtwelve credits.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Well, at least I'm second level.&quot;<p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>There was a quest at Tanglewood, (in Duncanville) and as I was enteringthe park, I ran into, for the only time, the first bard of the EmeraldHills to gain the bard masterhood!  He stood roughly at 5'11&quot;, wore abrown floppy hat and had a fairly nice outfit all and all.  He wasoccasionally known for showing up in a jester's costume on someoccasions.  But this sixth level bard was out to do some damage on thisquesting day.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>His name was Zendathamus!<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>After introductions were exchanged he said, &quot;Clu?  I've heard of you. By the way, where is your bardic blue?&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Bardic what?&quot;  When Kurgin and a few other people introduced me toAmtgard, they told me by word of mouth various bard abilities likevisit, charm, and things like that.  However, I thought these rules werejust  verbally agreed rules which you learned as you went.  I had neverheard about &quot;Class colors&quot;  I figured if you played a bard you dressedas a bard, and so forth.  Certainly people could tell what you wereplaying by the garb you wore, right?<p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>I would later get to see more of Zendathamus outside of Amtgard when Idated Elionwy.  Elionwy had two younger sisters that were both twins. At that time, one twin was dating Zendathamus, the other was datingMax!  Elionwy's house became known as the &quot;BARD HEADQUARTERS&quot; of theEmerald Hills.  Elionwy once joked that a new bardic recruit could cometo the &quot;Bard Headquarters&quot; and would be met by Zendathamus who wouldhave his feet propped up on the table in laid back fashion.  He woulddirect the recruit to Max, who would claim he was too busy with otherbusiness and to see Clu in the back.  After getting lost fromZendathamus' directions, they would have found me, who would engage themin a long and fairly fun conversation about generally everything.  Itwas only after leaving from the enjoyable visit that the recruit wouldrealize that he knew no more about bards after talking to me than he didwhen he first arrived.<p>	<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>On another battlegame day at Tanglewood, I was left to guard the flag. Along side of me was the assassin, future king, and knight of theCelestrial kingdom, Logan T. Black.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Max decided to take the flag.  For all intents and purposes, MaximillanMcDonald did not gain the &quot;Death Bard&quot; persona for no reason.  He wasfast, combining bardic verbals with sword and  shield he was a devastating force on the battlefield long before hereached sixth level as a bard.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Max approached within twenty feet of me, and started casting.  Ilaughed gallantly, thinking if monks and barbarians have immunity tobard verbals, certainly BARDS must be immune to bard verbals.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Unfortunately, Amtgard does not follow the paths of logic.  Max managedto get his first (and last) charm off on me.  Suddenly I was compelledto go back to my base (which was the flag, roughly 30 feet away) and soI ran to my base, and quickly returned to battle.  <br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>This time I had some &quot;words&quot; of my own.<p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>The scene was classic, and was made even more classic by Logan simplywatching off to the side as all this was going on.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>I approached Max, and he did likewise.  At the same time we rose apointing arm at each other, and at the same time we rattled off our 15word poems for the charm spell.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>(Actually, mine was 21 words long, and was the first part of theforgotten words to &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;)<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>A blaze of verbals flashed in the air, and as soon as it had started,it was over.  We looked at each other, and then at Logan.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Uh...  Max, I think Clu got you.&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>That was a great moment, since that was the first time I eversuccessfully got a bard charm off.  I was elated.   Logan and I cheeredas Max suddenly found himself compelled to journey back to his base onthe other side of the forest known as Tanglewood (And for good reasontoo).<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Our cheering ended of course when he returned to try a legend on us atextended range.<p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Time passed, and Max hit sixth level and suddenly the man who wasdangerous before was deadly now.  His title as the &quot;Death Bard&quot; gainedsolidity.  Suddenly many who had laughed at the bard class before foundthemselves  running to avoid verbals of a death machine.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>And I turned third level about then.<p><br>Midnight Sun, park of Duck Creek (Garland), a wonderful park containinga pavilion, wooded areas, trails, and a ton of mosquitoes.  But it wasduring this time my value as a third level bard became apparent.<p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Hey Clu, Max is coming our way, get rid of him.&quot;<p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>As Max continued forward I could have super-imposed lightning cracklingout of the sixth level demi-bard.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>At that time I had learned that I lived longer if I used a shield, butsword was not my choice of weapon, only a way of defense.  I was abard.  My purpose was to entertain and detain; to put someone out ofaction for a few minutes at a crucial part of the game was worse thanactually killing them.  And this form of humiliation I did with finesse. <br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>The result was usually the same.  We would approach each other, hewould rattle off a death verbal (Finger of Death was his impeccablefavorite) I would do an extended charm, and in the end, the charm wouldwin.<p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Time after time this continued.  I made him act like jello, act like amonkey and other various animals and objects until Max one day, as guildmaster of bards, let me know that asking people to act like animals  wasnot stated in the rules.  <br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Naturally, when fighting sword to sword, I was doing good to defendmyself and occasionally leg Max.  Max managed to also leg, kill, fry,and entangle me with almost the same ratio as my charms that werecompleted on him..  In the fighting area, Max managed to always have thegreater skill.  At one time legend was told that a king from anotherkingdom (Celestrial?) asked Sir Nevron if Max had the skill required forKnight of the Sword.  Sir Nevron told him no.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Later Max would hear about  Sir Nevron's lack of recommendation andproceeded to slay him on the battlefield that following weekend. Granted, Cabal backed him up, but it was said that Max managed a goodmajority of the killing blows.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Since Max claimed that making people act like animals and objects werenot stated in the rules of bardic charm (especially when it happened tohim) I developed the more task oriented charms.  On one battlegame dayat Duck Creek, I told Max for a one hundred and fifty count to try toread the park sign with a barbarian's education.   I will admit, Maxactually role played that well by running up to the sign and SLOWLYreading the sign about one foot away from it the whole time.   After awhile, as bard guild master, Max would let me know that making people docertain tasks for a set count was not stated in the bardic charm rules.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Under the reign of King Aron came many wars, and who would expect lessfrom the blood thirsty barbarian.  It was during this time that the Emerald Hills fought against Barad Duin (Austin).  Itjust so happens that Barad Duin asked Celestrial Kingdom in to join thefun, which raised the odds against the Emerald Hills.   But this onlymeant there was more foes for Aron and his kingdom to slay.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>The battle went well.  Mages would use mass death spells and thewarriors of the hills mopped up the rest.  During the battle I had ablast pointing and singing at opponents.  On one such occasion, RegentKaz was locked in combat when I came up behind him and sang at hisopponent.  His opponent realized that I was a bard and gave a look ofterror and fled.  Kaz looked back at me with a big smile and said &quot;NowTHAT was cool.&quot;<p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Max, in true &quot;Death Bard&quot; fashion, charged one of the shield walls atone point and managed to not only break the wall but take out anopponent.  After the battle was over, Max mentioned to me one adage thatI have found valuable.  He mentioned that he lost traction and slid intoone of the shieldmen.  It was not certain if the shieldman actually madea killing blow on Max, but Max took the shot anyway, giving him thebenefit of the doubt.  When explaining why he took the shot he gave theadage.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;When you boil it down, all that matters is respect.&quot;<p><center><img src="note.gif" height=30 width=582 alt="* * *"></center><p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;So you two actually spoke?&quot;  a voice said from (seemingly) no where.  Donnovan concurred on that thought.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Oh yeah, he and I would have flashes of camaraderie mixed with monthsof rivalry.  I guess at times we had our moments of cheezing eachother.   But any enemy worth having is a enemy worth knowing.  I thinkin time a mutual respect did grow.&quot;<p><center><img src="note.gif" height=30 width=582 alt="* * *"></center><p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Time passed, I achieved fifth level, and it was one day at Mirkwood(Rockwall) that I realized the tide had changed.  Where I had been thedispised bard, now Max found himself in the very role he had created forme.  <br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>As one person put it,<p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Clu is a bard, and Max is a bore.&quot;<p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>I thought revenge would be sweet, but it strangely hurt to hear myrival whom I had come to understand, talked about with such littlerespect.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>One day he literally stood up for himself and said,<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Now listen, I hear all of you talking about me, and I ask all of youin a nice way to leave me alone.  We all have different ways of playing our personas.  I don't judge people on how they play theirclasses, and I ask to be treated the same.&quot;<p>	<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>I sat there listening to him, and his words seemed to clash against thewords that ached so when I was content as a first level newbie, singingin Nirvana with the Nirvana Slugs.  I could recall him standing outsideof the Amtgard I knew at that time, in Nirvana, shouting in the words, <p><I><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;You call yourself a bard, but you're no bard....!&quot;<p></I><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>How ironic.  If he had never said that, he would have remained thepremier bard of the Emerald Hills.  I probably would have sung my songs,and happily moved on later.  I didn't know of rulebooks, and therefore Icould have cared less about the class.  Even before I played the bardclass, people believed I was a bard, and until that was challenged, thatwas all that mattered.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Now there he was, defending his right to have some peace in the game. I'd been there.  I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy, which Max wasno where close to being.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Let him be.&quot;  I told those around me.   They looked at me strangely,&quot;He is, after all, a great Death Bard.&quot;<p>	<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>From that point on, things went a little more smoothly.  We were stillrivals, but the competition was a little less heated.  One day as I wasfifth level someone was dumb enough to allow Max and I on the sameside.  The battlegame was at Tanglewood, and the enemy side wasdefending their flag on the &quot;island&quot; (a piece of land where a creekforked off into two creeks and then rejoined some fifty feet later). Guarding the flag was Mirth, a high level healer, and a wizard now knownas Talon, who was a high level mage.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Max was in the midst of a verbal spell battle with them when I askedhim, &quot;Hey Max, got a Emotion Control?&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;What level are you?&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Fifth.&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>He laughed, then charged the emotion control and ended the charge witha &quot;ZAP!   Alright, you're sixth level for thirty minutes.&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>After that, it was all over.  For the first time in the Emerald Hills,to the best of my knowledge, two sixth level bards, on the same side joined up.  Max started casting a finger of death.  Mirth andTalon fled out the range of his verbal to run headlong into my finger of death.  The look on Talon's face was classic when he suddenlyrealized that the musical and mostly harmless low level bard was nowcalling for his death.  He gave a shriek of terror and fled to the otherside of the island where they met Max's finger of death once again.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>After the seventh time of being ping-ponged, they decided to take thedeath.  Exhaustedly they wandered back to Nirvana.<p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>On the last night that I was to be a fifth level bard, I was up late atan event as usual.  Max happened to be up as well.  Being too tired tomove but not tired enough to sleep, we found chairs and startedtalking.  We talked on and on about the changes in Amtgard, and how thegame had changed many of the people that we had known, and sometimes weeven talked about the bard class.  Like two old war veterans, we talkeduntil the sun rose from the night.  We started talking in darkness andwe ended the conversation in broad daylight.<p><center><img src="note.gif" height=30 width=582 alt="* * *"></center><p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Speaking of which, &quot; Avice stated looking around at the slight reddishhaze over horizon, &quot;I think I'd better get at least some sleep beforedawn patrol comes around.&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>As she headed away from the fire ring, Clu and Donnovan noticed withthe growing light that Vuzlyn had fallen asleep where he had beenlistening to the story.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;And people wondered why bards got the sleep spell.  Hehehe..&quot; Clumused gesturing in the direction of Vuzlyn.<p>	<IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;So what happened after you and Max talked that night?&quot; Donnovanasked.  The bard only smiled that one listener cared to know the rest ofthe story.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Max, being the bard guild master that he had been for so long testedme for sixth level.  I personally think the sixth level test for thebard is the biggest pain out of all the Amtgard classes.  Six levels ofdruid magic to study through, a whole different point system.   I musthave studied for that stupid test the whole next day.  But Max was coolabout it and gave a test that made sure I understood the general ideasof druid magic and the bard class.<p><center><img src="note.gif" height=30 width=582 alt="* * *"></center><p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>With two established six level bards now walking around blasting thepopulous, an explosion of bards happened at Mirkwood and throughout theEmerald Hills.   Rouge, Conobar, Sparrow Hawk, Damon, Finn McGill, andmy bardic apprentice Faith to name a few.  Some became great bards, others downright stunk as they twisted the rules ofthe bard class.  In some cases, Max and I shook our heads, and others wesuggested for masterhood as they developed their own identities as abard.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>One time at Camp Ellowy during the reign of King Wolvie a populousmember noticed Max and I conversing about a bard that looked likemasterhood material.  <br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>The person yelled out,  &quot;Wow, It's Clu to the Max!!&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>I could tell Max was moderately amused...<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>	... so I laughed for both of us.   <p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24> Max and I were definitely extremes of the bard class, but we were notthe first and will not be the last of the bards.
