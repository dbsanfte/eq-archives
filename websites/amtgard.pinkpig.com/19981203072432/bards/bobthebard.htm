His mandolin was propped against therock, and his eyes were closed.  The warmth of the midafternoon sun waslulling him to sleep.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Hoofbeats intruded as he lay dozing, and reluctantly he sat up,shaded his eyes, and peered down the road.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>The figure approaching appeared as a legend embodied.  A splendidcharger with golden tack pranced tirelessly towards him.  The knightlyfigure sat astride with head thrown back, reigns held high in one cockedwrist, the other hand planted firmly on his hip.  His mail was white andhighly polished, his tabard golden-trimmed.  A great white plume thrustgrandly from his white helm.  An enormous hand-and-a-half sword with ascrolled golden hilt swung on one side.  He was a picture of all that isnoble, fine, good, pure, holy, hot, and uncomfortable.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>This splendid figure of a knight drew his prancing mount to ahalt beside the rock. One hand lifted his visor and a great beaming faceassaulted Robert.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Ho there, friend!&quot; the knight boomed.  &quot;Might I assume that thouart a noble minstrel from thy graceful instrument lying yonder?&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Robert blanched.  &quot;I am a bard,&quot; he allowed.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>The knight laughed joyously.  &quot;Well then, noble bard!  I am SirRoland, and I am on a Most Noble Quest for Her Majesty the Queen!  Iwould deem my adventures well begun indeed should you consent to followalong and set my grand deeds to bardic word, that I might find fame atlast!  What a noble idea!&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Noble,&quot; muttered Robert.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;What say you, O most wondrous tale-spinner?&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Robert pulled a sheet of parchment and a stub of charcoal fromhis pack and wrote down &quot;O most wondrous.&quot;  He then replaced it, slunghis pack over one shoulder, retrieved his mandolin, and walked onto thehighway.   &quot;Sure, why not,&quot; he told the knight.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;And by what name art thou known?&quot; asked the knight as they movedoff down the road.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Bob.  Bob the Bard.&quot;<p><center><img src="note.gif" height=30 width=582 alt="* * *"></center><P><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>They ambled a ways down the road.  &quot;What quest are you about?&quot; Bob asked.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Sir Roland swelled considerably.  &quot;In a small, innocent hamletlies a graveyard with a crypt.  This is no ordinary crypt, I assurethee.&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Of course not,&quot; Bob murmured.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Indeed, the villagers report that a foul demonic presence fromwithin has been terrorizing the country.  Cattle have been foundhideously mutilated, chickens beheaded, vir- er, fair maidens carriedoff.  Her Most Royal Majesty the Queen  has entrusted me with this mostnoble task- to rid the land of this foul evil and restore the countrysideto its noble self.  Is that not grand?&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Foul.  Noble.  Grand.&quot; said Bob.  &quot;How far is this crypt?&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;It is a foul and perilous journey, many days to the north&quot;<p><center><img src="note.gif" height=30 width=582 alt="* * *"></center><p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Fifteen minutes later, after correcting their course and headingeast, they found the graveyard.  Clouds had darkened the skies and apalpable aura of evil had surrounded them.  The gravestones were old, thecarvings worn smooth, and few still stood erect.  It was through thismossy lair of the dead that they trod, until they at last located theentrance to the evil crypt.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Sir Roland stopped, puzzled.  &quot;&quot;Er.... how do I open this?&quot;  Forthe door was of smooth marble, unmarked and without cracks in which thefingers might find purchase.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Knock,&quot; suggested Bob.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Sir Roland looked askance at him, then shrugged.  He knocked.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>The earth erupted beneath his feet, and Sir Roland threw himselfbackwards, startled.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>A skeleton clad in ragged plaid rose slowly from the ground.  Aset of moldy bagpipes were clutched in his fleshless hands.  &quot;None maypass until I am bested in a contest of riddles,&quot; it intoned.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Sir Roland scratched his head.  He slowly turned to Bob.  &quot;MostNoble Bob,&quot; he began hesitantly, &quot;I'm.... I would bow to your expertisein this manner.&quot; He shifted nervously, eyes pleading.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Bob sighed, then faced the skeletal Scot.  &quot;I shall meet you inBardic Challenge,&quot; he told it.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>It nodded slowly.  &quot;Please, sir bard, take the first bow.&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Sir Roland flinched, expecting physical combat.  Bob shook hishead at him, irritated.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Please, sir guardian, proceed.  It is you who challenges ourright to pass.&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>The skeleton bowed.  &quot;I thank you for your wisdom.  I shallproceed.

It's the law of the bardicguild.&quot;  He turned back to the skeleton.  &quot;Now sir-<br><ul><ul><ul>		<i>'Weight in my belly<br>		Trees on my back<br>		Nails in my ribs<br>		Feet I do lack.'</i>&quot;<br></ul></ul></ul><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>The skeleton considered gravely.  &quot;A ship.&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Correct,&quot; said Bob.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Roland groaned.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;All right,&quot; said the skeletal bard.  &quot;Try this-<br><ul><ul><ul>		<i>'At the sound of me, men may cheer<br>		Or stamp their feet.<br>		At the sound of me, women may laugh<br>		Or sometimes weep.'</i>&quot;<br></ul></ul></ul><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Bob considered this for a few minutes.  Roland began to shiftabout nervously. Finally.....<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Music,&quot; said Bob.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Correct,&quot; said the skeleton.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Whoopee!&quot; yelled Roland, jumping up and down.  &quot;I know one!&quot; he hollered enthusiastically.  &quot;I know- how about, how about..... 'A boxwithout hinges, key or..... li....&quot; he trailed off as he became aware oftheir disapproving glares.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Bob sighed.  &quot;I apologize for this interruption,&quot; he told theskeleton.  &quot;Please accept my deepest regrets.&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>The skeleton bowed.  &quot;Not at all, my friend.  You cannot be heldresponsible for the ignorant and uncivilized.  Pray continue.&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;You are most gracious.

The crypt door swung open.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;You did it!' whooped Roland.  &quot;What was the answer?&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;It was a simple one, really,&quot; Bob said absently.  &quot;'Sunlight'&quot;.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Then why did he miss it?&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;He's forgotten what it is.&quot;  Bob entered the crypt.<p><center><img src="note.gif" height=30 width=582 alt="* * *"></center><p><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>They stood in the crypt's front room.  A stone slab lay in thecenter with a small metal stand atop it.  Perched upon the stand was ablack jewel, pulsing with an evil purplish glow.  Otherwise, it was quietand empty.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Sir Roland looked around.  &quot;Now what?&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Bob shrugged.  &quot;Break the jewel.&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Sir Roland thought that this was a splendid idea.  Drawing hissword, he struck the jewel.  It shattered easily.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Immediately, the feelings of dread and menace were gone.  The sun shone, the birds sang, and all was well again.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Sir Roland was dumbstruck.  &quot;That's IT?  That was my wonderfulquest??  Where are the demons?  Where are the foul monsters to vanquishin mighty battle??  What will I tell the Queen?!?!&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Bob tilted his head to one side.  &quot;The truth, I'm sure,&quot; he saidmildly.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Sir Roland buried his head in his hands and began to rock backand forth in misery. &quot;I'm ruined,&quot; he moaned.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;I'm sure I could sing a tale of your bravery and valor,&quot; saidBob distantly.  &quot;About the....... hundreds of demonic monsters youvanquished- nobly, of course.&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Sir Roland looked up slowly.  &quot;You..... you would do that?&quot; heasked hopefully.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Bob reeled in the hook.  &quot;Sure.  For ten gold pieces, I'll writeyou a wondrous noble tale that will bring you fame and fortune from farand wide.&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;T-ten WHAT?!&quot; Sir Roland gaped.  &quot;Money?  You would take money for a song?  For a lie?&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>Bob waved dismissively.  &quot;It's not a lie,&quot; he soothed.  &quot;Merelyembellishment- poetic license, you know.  After all, had there truly beena few thousand demons, surely a noble knight like yourself would havetriumphed.&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;That's true!&quot; Sir Roland perked up.  &quot;But what if someone foundout?&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;No one will,&quot; Bob assured him.  &quot;We do this sort of thing allthe time.  Every time, in fact.  Do we have a deal?&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Deal,&quot; said Sir Roland, counting out coins as they walked away.	<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;You know, for five more I'll double the number of foes and add adamsel in distress for you to rescue.&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;No..... I guess I don't really need a damsel,&quot; said Sir Rolandreluctantly.  &quot;Listen.... the legends of Sir Richard..... were those.....I mean.....&quot;<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Bob as their voices faded into the distance.<br><IMG SRC="tab.gif" alt=" " BORDER=0 HEIGHT=5 WIDTH=24>&quot;What about Sir Lancelot?
