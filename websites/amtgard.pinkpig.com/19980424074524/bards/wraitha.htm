I'll be a knight in shining armor,<br>
Just resurrect me when I die.<br>
With foam swords I'll impale you,<br>
And this shield might help too.<br>
Normal folk might have to ask me why.<p>

I'll be a knight in shining armor,<br>
And dodge the spell balls when they're thrown.<br>
Just slay these monsters quickly,<br>
Before they can kill me.<br>
Then my enemies will cry and moan.<p>

A helpless peasant taken prisoner,<br>
Can't let the evil darkness pull them down.<br>
Revenge is required for my honor.<br>
Oh the foam will fly,<br>
Enemies will die.<p>

I'll be a knight in shining armor,<br>
My stock of garb and swords will grow.<br>
It's not that hard to make them,<br>
Techniques to use them I will show.<br>
Every warrior they'll know.<br>
Then off to battle we'll go.<br>
Off to battle we'll go.<br>
Off to battle we'll go.<p align="right">
