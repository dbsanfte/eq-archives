I hope to explain some of the mysteries on this highlyformalized art for all to enjoy. I will also include some of my favoritesand some of my own.<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">The original poetic form of Haiku, is the tanka, of which a haiku is merelythe first 3 lines. Whereas a Haiku has a syllabic count of 5, 7, 5 per line, the tanka is characterized by 5, 7, 5, 7, 7, or two more lines each of 7 syllables.<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">Haiku is unique in that it requires an immense amount of readerparticipation. Meanings and insinuations abound in haiku that are not seenif the word is taken for face value. Example: Autumn, only two syllables(one in japanese) but volumes of meaning. Imagine your favorite or leastfavorite fall day. This is what is meant by "Autumn," not just the word orimpressions of the season but also feelings, symbolism and mythos.<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">In original form, Haiku is 17 syllables - 5 syllables in the first andthird line and 7 syllables in the second line, there can be as many versesas you want, though Soun or free verse haiku which is becoming popularbreaks these traditions...the following is a Soun written by Basho,foremost master of modern haiku:<p><pre>     Kareeda ni     Karasu no tomarikeri     Aki no kure     On the dead limb     squats a crow -      autumn night.</pre><p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">18 syllables and it is still considered one of his greatest. Noticethe dash in the second line. This is a kireji or "cutting word" thisdenotes a sudden perception of something not immediate to the senses.<p><pre>     An old oak     cares not for     cherry blossoms             -Basho     Girl cat so     thin on love     and barley              -Basho</pre>     <font size=2>(Barley is a staple diet for alley cats in japan)</font><p> <img src="tab.gif" alt="">I said haiku requires reader participation. Imagine this...coldwintery day with a blowing wind, thin clouds obscure and filter the sunslight. A day of meloncholy. Then two pigeons land near you and begin topeak at each other's beaks...It looks like they are kissing...smiling athow the birds resemble your own wishes, you don't realize until you turn toleave, that the sun has finally shone through the clouds to begin warmingthe day. <p><pre>               Cloudy winter day     Pigeons kiss then stand ashamed-     So bright the sun now!</pre><img src="tab.gif" alt="">Thanks for listening to my ramblings here's a few more you might like:<p><pre>     The poems of nature     And seventeen syllables     Too much to say</pre> <font size =2>    (My own soun, only 16 syllables)</font><p>-<p><pre>     Fading bells -     Now musky blossoms     Peal in dusk     Lightening -      Heron-cry      Stabs darkness</pre><p>                                  - Master Bard, Dall&#233; de Sall&#233;, December 9, 1996</P>&#169;1997 <A HREF="mailto: d6v6i6l@rocketmail.com">Brandon C.
