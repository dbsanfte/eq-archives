He’ll at times fight with a Hooked Hand or with a Parrot on his shoulder. At the double wars a few years ago, he and his group of pirates, hid a treasure and made a map in three pieces. During the Magna Carter War all fighters had a chance to find the map pieces and hopefully the treasure. The Fat Guys got one of the pieces and found another Lord who had the other two. They spent the rest of the Battle searching for the treasure, except for myself and Martin the Mercenary, who stayed behind to guard a village and war point. Sadly they did not find the treasure before the battle ended.<p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="inthecrown.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Here I am, in the Crown)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="imasquire.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Oh, Oh, Oh, I'm a Squire)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">87</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
