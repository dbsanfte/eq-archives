Sir Axel, a knight of renown<BR>                                                    
discovered the name of the town <br>                                                
that eluded the best<br>                                                            
on many a quest<br>                                                                 
where the Most Holy Grail could be found.<p>                                       
                                                                                
"In Ausfart" he uttered one day<br>                                                 
to the King at a feast, held in May<br>                                             
"the Grail I'll retrieve<br>
if you'll give me your leave<br>                                                    
for there's signs that will show me the way".<p>
                                                                                
With leave granted he called for his squire<br>                                     
who was warming his toes by the fire<br>                                        
"Squire! bring me my gear<br>                                                       
and a few kegs of beer<br>                                                          
for we ride on a quest for our Sire"<p>                                            
                                                                                
Our heroes went forth on this quest<br>                                              
and they traveled for months without rest<br>                                      
when the sign read Ausfart<br>                                                      
off the road they'd depart<br>                                                      
but the town was not there, what a jest.<p>                                        
                                                                                
When the last keg was empty of beer<br>                                             
went the squire to a town that was near<br>                                         
where a maiden named Nancy<br>                                                      
did tickle his fancy<br>                                                            
and he deserted the quest so I hear<p>                                             
                                                                                
So Axel continued alone<br>                                                         
following Ausfart signs, he did roam<br>                                            
but the towns where they showed<br>                                                 
were some other abode<br>                                                           
so by winter he headed back home.<p>                                               
                                                                                
In spring he continued the quest<br>                                                
after getting some much needed rest<br>                                             
and of course some more beer<br>                                         
and some haunches of deer<br>                                
he returned to his travels with zest<p>                         
                                                                                
At last, at the wars of the cookie<br>                                              
he said to his horse "Lookie! Lookie!"<br>                                          
for where the roads crossed<br>                                                     
was "Kreis Ausfart" embossed<br>                                                    
and he jumped off his horse for a lookie<p>                                        
                                                                                
But the good folk attending the war<br>                                             
said "The grail was once here, but no more"<br>                                     
In a rage that that was grand<br>                                                   
he tore the sign from it's stand<br>                                                
then tossed it down onto the floor<p>                                          
                                                                                
He then prayed unto to God, most sublime<br>                                        
"Oh Lord, please give me a sign"<br>                                                
the clouds they did part<br>                                                        
and where written "Ausfart"<br>                                                     
"Umlitung" was now on the sign<p>

	(To the tune of "Moose" or "Abuse")</h4>
<p>
</center>
<p>
	One evening when I passed a fire burning bright<br>
	I felt a large rumble that gave me a fright<br>
	The Fat Guys were singing and dancing around<br>
	The pounding was actually shaking the ground<p>

<b>(Chorus:)<br>
O-bese, O-bese, they are O-bese<br>
Just watch and you'll see their waist lines increase<br>
They live large and battle and revel and feast<br>
They call them the Fat Guys and they are Obese</b><p>

	At the fat guys encampment I was quite aghast<br>
	Sweat pants and baseball caps weren't in the past<br>
	They ignored me and everything I had to say<br>
	That's life when there's Fat Guys in the SCA	<p>
<b>(Chorus)</b><p>
	For Ladies, the Fat Guys can be a surprise<br>
	They'll provide all the courtesies born low or high<br>  
	And lots of fine humor to bring you a smile<br>
	They may have large bellies, but MAN they have style<p>
<b>(Chorus)</b><p>
	For gentles there's also good reason to cheer<br>
	No discussions of politics to sour the ear<br>
	Just drinking and singing be you peasant or peer<br>
	But the best thing of all is they always have Beer <p>
<b>(Chorus)</b><p>
	Even though they've been drinking and singing all night<br>
	Come morning, they're armored and ready to fight<br>
	Whether fighting on bridges, in barges or towns<br>
	Just show them a shield wall and they'll mow it down<p>
<b>(Chorus)</b><p>
	The Fat Guys are easy to see on the field<br>
	a gold mug on green with handle under the shield<br>
	there is one more feature that scares me profound<br>
	If there's foam on the mug it means they have a CROWN!<p>

<center> <h3>Ballad of Blackleaf</h3>
 
<h4>(by Gorlan of the Red Lands)<br>
(To the tune of "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm" by the Crash Test Dummies)</h4>
<p>
</center>
<p><ul>
Once there was a Fat - Guy<br>
Got into a Tournament just to bash some heads in<br>
When it all was o-ver<br>
They -<br>
Put - <br>
A pointy hat on his bald head<br>
He didn't realize till that mo-ment <br>
It was the viceroy Tour-ney<p>

Beer, Beer, Beer, Beer<br>
Beer, Beer, Beer, Beer, Beer<p>

Beer, Beer, Beer, Beer<br>
Beer, Beer, Beer, Beer, Beer<p>

Now he was a Vice-Roy<br>
Had to act respectable, spend his time at politics<br>
No Beer - with other Fat - Guys<br>
At - <br>
Court - <br>
He had to sit in the front row<br>
But what really got him up-set<br>
He had to do it So-ber<p>

No Beer, No Beer, No Beer, No Beer, No Beer<p>

No Beer, No Beer, No Beer, No Beer, No Beer<p>

Heed -  well the tale of Black-leaf<br>
Never win in tournaments when pointy hats are giv-en<br>
No Beer -  in court with Fat Guys<br>
If - <br>
You - <br>
Do there is one small compensation.<br>
On your Fat Guy Ta-bard<br>
You get to put some Foam - On<p>

<h4>(By Gorlan of the Red Lands)</h4><p>

<p><ul>
	There's a Barony in Drachenwald<br>
	Knight's Crossing it is called<br>
	And there they hold the Cookie Wars	<br>
	Enjoyed by one and all.<br>
	Even though most of the battles<br>
	Are fought in the sun's light<br>
	The final battle begins after dark <br>
	and continues throughout the night. <p>
<b>(Chorus:)<br><ul>
	Take a cookie in your left hand<br>
	Take a cookie in your right.<br>
	Munch Left, <br>
	Munch Right, <br>
	Wash it down with a beer<br>
	Repeat throughout the night. <br>
	If one cookie is uneaten <br>
	When the sun comes up once more<br>
	Then although we ate and drank all night<br>
	We'll have lost the cookie war. <p></b></ul>

	There's field battles a plenty <br>
	And woods and towns and more.<br>
	Every fighter is sure to get their fill<br>
	of bashing heads and swords.<br>
	But when the armor comes off<br>
	there is still one fight to fight<br>
	The final battle begins after dark <br>
	And continues throughout the night.<p>

<b>(Chorus)</b><p>

	Come morning the ground is covered <br>
	with a hundred empty beers<br>
	And the broken bodies of cookies<br>
	tell of a battle without peer.<br>
	Before we leave it's cleaned up<br>
	not a crumb left on the floor.<br>
	Then we'll be back again next year<br>
	for another Cookie War.<p>

<h4>(By Gorlan of the Red Lands)<br>
(Loosely To the Tune of Rodeo)</h4>
<p>
</center>	
<p>
<ul>
	There's a creature out among us<br>
	That's a danger to the Dream<br>
	He's been here since the early days<br>
	And you all know who I mean<br>
	On the field he has no honor<br>
	He will never take your blow<br>
	He is no ones friend<br>
	Has to cheat to win <br>
	He's the SCA Rhino<br>
	He's a Rhino<p>
<b>(Chorus:)<br><ul>	
	When you bash his Helm<br>
	And it rings the realm<br>
	But he stands and calls it light<br>
	Then you dent his arms<br>
	and you dent his legs<br>
	But he won't quit the fight<br>
	You can smash his face <br>
	With an iron mace <br>
	But he'll ignore the blow<br>
	I tell ya my friend <br>
	You can never win <br>
	If you're fighting against a Rhino<p></ul></b>

	It is really hard to fathom<br>
	What must go on in his mind<br>
	The drive to win becomes so bad<br>	
	That honor is left behind<br>
	It really is a pity<br>
	He has the skill, I know<br>
	To win it clean most of the time <br>
	But instead he just Rhinos.<br>
	He's a Rhino.<p>

<b>(Chorus)</b><p>
	He always has excuses<br>
	For shots he did not take<br>
	But after time and again <br>
	Excuses grow thin<br>
	No doubt and no mistake<br>
	His disease is catching<br>
	Don't let it happen to you<br>
	Never let yourself say<br>

<center><h3>Three drunken Fat Guys</h3>
<p>
<h4>(By Gorlan of the Red lands)<br>
(To the tune of three Drunken Maidens)
</h4>
<p>
</center>
<p><ul>
	There were three drunken Fat Guys<br>
	Who attended court one night.<br>
	They'd been at it several hours<br>
	They really were a sight.<br>
	They brought with them <br>
	All kinds of beer<br>
	From Bock to guinness stout. <br>
	They also brought a keg of ale<br>
	To ensure they'd not run out.  <p>
	
	The room was called to order <br>
	As the King and Queen came in<br>
	On  legs no longer steady <br>
	They stood and bowed and then<br>
	When given leave, they sat back down<br>
	While drinking in the back<br>
	Since standing up was such hard work<br>
	Their mugs they did attack<p>

	Then in came two more Fat Guys<br>
	Who joined them in the rear<br>
	They didn't come empty handed<br>
	They brought a case of beer<br>
	As court progressed the beer ran out<br>
	And they had to switch to ale<br>
	The Herald started sweating<br>
	He was nervous, you could tell.<p>

	But then the Herald started smiling <br>
	As the Queen whispered in his ear<br>
	He then called out for Michael <br>
	Their leader to Appear<br>
	They said that he was courteous<br>
	And chivalrous and more<br>
	When they made him a Queen's Companion<br>
	All Jaws just hit the Floor.<p>

	One thought came to each Fat Guy<br>
	"Michael Say it isn't So!"<br>
	All had to drink down more ale <br>
	To cushion off the blow<br>
	By the end of court, the ale was gone<br>
	And they were on the floor<br>
	But since they were all Fat Guys<br>
	We rolled them out the door.<p>

<p>
</center>	
<p>
<ul>
	If you've never worn a codpiece before<br>
	It is a strange sensation<br>
	When you traverse across the field<br>
	It makes obscene gyrations<p>
<b>(Chorus)<br><ul>
	A Cod-piece can fool them all<br>
	Make them think you're large  <br>
	Even if you're small<br>
	Just be sure you don't fool yourself<br>
	For it's still just imagination<p></ul></b>

	You have to be careful in a crowd <br>
	Each step made with hesitation<br>
	For a careless bump to another's rump<br>
	May result in penetration<p>

<b>(Chorus)</b><p>

	And to be sure it works like a lure<br>
	And will raise a wench's expectations<br>
	But have a care you have something there<br>
	Or the night will end in frustration<p>

<b>(Chorus)</b><p>

	They can be made of silk or be made of steel<br>
	You can paint them with illuminations<br>
	You can even use an old drinking horn<br>
	And gain the blue feather's admiration<p>

<b>(Chorus)</b><p>

	There are many reasons to put one on<br>
	It really needs no explanation<br>
	But the best of all, It will still stand tall<br>
	Even if yours is on a vacation.<p>

<b>(Chorus)</b><p>

	They can be at rest or in full salute<br>
	In any desired configuration<br>
	But the  best to date was a castle gate<br>
	The drawbridge got a standing ovation<br>
	<ul><ul>	<i>(or)</i><br></ul></ul>
	The drawbridge caused quite a sensation<p>

<ul>
The care and feeding of wenches <br>
Is a noble art so fair -o <br>
Always see she has a seat <br>
By giving up your chair-o<br>
Never let her carry loads<br>
See that her gear's transported<br>
And if she's called before the crown<br>
Ensure that she's escorted.<p>

Listen to her every word<br>
Give her your full attention <br>
Always praise the garb she wears<br>
Her beauty you should mention <br>
Be sure to rub her shoulders fair<br>
Till tension has receded<br>
And if invited do her back <br>
Leave it nice and kneaded<p>

A wench should not be left alone<br>
She should be well attended<br>
Make sure her cup is ever full<br>
And she'll think you are splendid<br>
Have plenty of chocolate close hand<br>
Her smiles it will sweeten<br>
And if you follow all these steps <br>
The results can not be beaten. <p>

If you go into the Fat Guys Camp<br>

 Just take a swig of Helm&uuml;t's Home Brew<br>
And your stomach will be aglow<br>
The flavor is strange and what he puts in  <br>
You really don't want to know<br>
From Cinnamon Clove and Chocolate Cream<br>
To Baloney Schnapps, it's really obscene<br>
And that's the danger of sampling<br>
Helm&uuml;t's Home Brew<p>

It's a powerful brew and if I were you<br>
I'd really would  listen up<br>
The side effects can be much, much more <br>
Than ending up in your cups<br>
All of the bottles do clearly explain<br>
To much will make you like Mike Aquitane.<br>

 </center><p>
	<ul>
	Count Garick went up to Nordmark <br>
	For Double Wars number ten	<br>
	Entered the Fat Guy's Beer Pit<br>	
	The Prize was beer; He had to win <p>

	Fighting in a beer pit<br>		
	Winning each round, round<br>	
	Fighting in a beer pit	<br>	
	Watching His foes fall down 	<br>
	Fighting in a beer pit 	<br>	
	Winning each round, round <br>	
	When He wins the beer pit <br>	
	He'll win a huge beer mound	<p>

	Count Garick found he won much more <br>
	Than he could drink in one night<br>
	He built a dam in a stream bed <br>
	To hold his beer and cool it right<p>

	Garick won it in a beer pit<br>
	It was huge beer mound<br>
	He placed in the  Stream bed  <br>
	To cool it on down <br>	
	Garick won it in a beer pit<br>
	It was huge beer mound<br>
	He placed in the  Stream bed  <br>
	To cool it on do___own <p>	

	When Garick woke in the morning <br>
	His beer was nowhere in sight <br>
	Rain had raised  the stream level<br>
	His beer floated,  away in the night.<p>

	He won it in a beer pit <br>
	It was a huge beer mound<br>
	He put it in the stream bed <br>
	To  cool it on down <br>
	But that night it rained hard<br>
	it kept pouring down, down<br>
	And the beer floated away <br>
	never to be fou__nd. <p>

	So Garick is sad and woeful<br>
	He misses all of that beer <br>
	He may be a superior fighter<br>
	But he makes a lousy engineer.<p>
	
	He won it in a beer pit <br>
 	It was a huge beer mound<br>
	but it floated away <br>
	Never to be found.<br>
	He won it in a beer pit <br>
 	It was a huge beer mound<br>
	but it floated away <br>
	Never to be found.<p>

	Just before he left Nordmark<br>
	One beer was found in the stream<br>
	So he did not leave thirsty<br>
	But the mound still haunts his dreams <p>

	He won it in a Beer Pit <br>
	It was a huge beer mound<br>
	but it floated away <br>
	Never to found<br>
	He won it in a Beer Pit<br>
	It was a huge beer mound <br>
	but it floated away <br>
	Never to be found<p>

And that whole family values thing<br>
White feathers still got for wenching, <br>
But only with a ring.<p>

So if you find you're in agreement<br>
Put a white feather in your cap<br>
And you'll hear no more tales of Village Idiots<br>
Catching it in their Hats. <p>

White Feathers - - White Feathers.<p>

Blue Feathers are so Pretty<br>
Their garb show impecable taste<br>
But Blue Feathers don't go for women<br>
Ladies sigh " What a Waste!".<p>

Blue Feathers can look manly<br>
With bulging muscles and firm behind<br>
They wear the feather so that the ladies<br>
Won't end up wasting time.<p>

They throw great parties at Pennsic<br>
And I hear that the good times roll<br>
But be warned that to get inside<br>
You'll have to pay their toll. <p>

Blue Feathers - - Blue Feathers <br>
Blue Feathers - -  White Feathers - -   Blue Feathers - -  White Feathers<p>

	<center><h3>6 Beer Court In Drachenwald</h3>
<p>
 <h4>(By Lord Gorlan of the Redlands)
<br>
	(Loosely to the tune of the Beach Boys "Little Honda" (1st gear)/ Surfin City)</h4>
<p>
</center>
<p>
	I attended a  6 beer court in Drachenwald one night   <br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i> <br>
	It seemed to go forever and looked like it had no end in site<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i><br>
	But I was sitting with the Fat Guys and they knew just what to do <br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i> <br>
	They were well stocked with provisions and several cases of Brew<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i> <p>

<b>Chorus:<ul>
	1st beer goes down light<br>
	2nd beer is just right<br>
	3rd beer you're feelin tight<br>
	at a long court<br>
	4th beer you can't see<br>
	5th beer find a tree<br>
	6th beer you just pee <br>
	at a long court <p></b></ul>

	They started out with thanks to the autocrat for all that was done<br>
 	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i> <br>
	And thanks to the marshals for a tourney that was well run <br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i><br>
	The water bearers and chiurgens got called up too<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i> <br>
	And before I knew it, my first beer was all through<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i> <p>
	<ul><b>Chorus</b></ul>
	Some folks presented gifts to butter up the King and queen<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i><br>
	The groveling was awful, I sure you know just what I mean<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i><br>
	Then they presented AOAs to create some Lord and Ladies too<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i><br>
	And again before I knew it my second beer was through<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i><p>
	<ul><b>Chorus</b></ul>	
	They gave a silver guard to a man who could swing a stick<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i><br>
	And linquest ring went to a gentil who's tounge was slick<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i><br>
	And to some artisans they presented a panache or two <br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i> <br>
	and sure enough my third beer was also through<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i><p>
	<ul><b>Chorus</b></ul>
	Next came a grant of arms, to make a Right, Honorable Lord<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i><br>
	You could that the populous was starting to get very Bored.<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i><br>
	A black guard fell asleep and almost got the king with his spear.<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i> <br>
	When all got back to normal I finished off my 4th beer.<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i> <p>
	 <ul><b>Chorus</b></ul> 
They then called up a Lady and awarded her the Dragon's Steel <br>
<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i><br>
Because in swishy-pokey, she could bring all others to heel.<br>
<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i>  <br>
	They inducted a new member into the Order of Albinon<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i> <br>
	And before I knew it, I found my 5th beer was gone.<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i> <p>
	<ul><b>Chorus</b></ul>
	Finally they announced that they would create some new peers<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i> <br>
	I was starting to get worried, because the cooler was almost out of beers<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i><br>
	They made a Knight, and Laurel and a Pelican too.<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i> <br>
	And when they closed court, I'd just finished off my 6th brew.<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i><p>
	<ul><b>Chorus</b></ul>
	If you live in Drachenwald there's something that you must do<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i><br>
	When attending court, be sure to stock plenty of brew.<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i> <br>
	Because even if you are well lit at the time that court begins<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i> <br>
	If do not plan ahead, you'll be sober by the time it ends.<br>
	<i>6 beer court in Drachenwald</i> <p>
	<ul><b>Chorus</b></ul>

	He feeds them sweets and other treats<br>

	No one would he defame.<br>

	You'd better make out a will.<br>
	Always fights with gusto,<br>
	He'll kill you with a smile.<br>
	The bodies mount around his feet,<br>

<ul>
 	Three knights one eve were bragging <br>
	About their squire's bravery<br>
	On how they each possessed the best <br>
	Of the aspiring nobility<P>

	The first said "Mines the bravest<br>
	And to prove it he will go<br>
	And slay the worm who lives in woods <br>	
	Armed with his sword and bow". <p>

	And bravely he went into the woods<br>
	And was heard a savage fight<br>
	But then his flaming helm returned<br>
	And landed at the feet of his knight<p>

	The second said "Mines the bravest<br>
	And to prove it he will go<br>
	And slay the ogre who live in the cave<br>
	In the valley down below.<p>

	And bravely he went into the cave<br>
	And again was heard a savage fight<br>
	Then out from the cave rolled a battered helm<br>	
	"What a pity" said the second knight.<p>

	The third said "Mines the bravest, <br>
	of that there can be no doubt<br>
	Just watch this" the third knight said	<br>
	And "Squire!" he did shout<p>
	
	"What do you want?" the Squire said<br>
	To the three knights by the fire<br>
	His knight said "Fetch us some beer, my boy!" <br>
	"Get it yourself,"  bravely said the Squire.<p>

	I'm tired of being labeled a whore <br>
	No thank you please <br>
	I've given up that sleeze <br>
	I tell you I don't do that anymore<p>

	A Wench I know at the Celtic Sheep and Garter Raids<br>
	She smiled because I did not understand <br>
	Then she pulled off a drive by schmoozing Oh Ho<br>	
	I say it was the finest in the land<p>

	And I said <br>
	Go Go Go Go <br>
	I want to do this some more<br>
	I don't care if I'm labeled a whore<br>	
	Yes thank you please<br>
	I guess I'm back into sleeze<br>
	It's songs and fruit and schmoozing evermore!!! <p>
	  
<b>Lets all say </b> <br>
	Go Go Go Go <br>
	We want to do this some more<br>
	We don't care if we're all labeled whores<br>	
	Yes thank you please<br>
	We're really into sleeze<br>
	It's songs and fruit and schmoozing evermore!!! <p>

	Round and round the Baron they go, <br>
	Trying to gain his favor.<br>
	The courtiers noses are getting quite brown.<br>
	"Get a life" says the Baron.<p>
<b>Chorus:<ul>
	The Baron says, <br>
	"You've all got to learn<br>
	To work and play well with others.<br>
	Don't waste my time <br>
	With childish games,<br>
	Grow up or go back to your mothers." </b></ul><p>		

	When flattery failed, they complained to the King;<br>
	They say that he won't listen <br>
	To backstabing rumors and innuendos.<br>
	"Get a life" says the Baron.<p>
<b>Chorus:</b><p>
	The King called up the Baron one night, <br>
	He said the he was con-cerned,<br>
	Cause courtiers can't handle clean politics.<br>
	"Get a life" says the Baron. <p>
<b>Chorus:</b><p>
	The courtiers are really at quite a loss,<br>
	He won't listen to their slander.<br>
	Candor is something they don't understand.<br>
	"Get a life" says the Baron.<p>
<b>Chorus:</b><p>	
	The courtiers hope he will not last long,<br>
	Cause he insists that they all play nice.<br>
	They haven't had lives in such a long time, <br>
	They don't know how to follow his ad-vice.<P>

	At the end I was really sore<br>
	We  couldn't see the swings <br>
	Just heard the helmet rings <br>
	A silly way to play at war.<br>
<br>
	They put us in a ring of torches<br>
	Then the marshalls called out "Lay-ON"<br>
	We swung at invis-able foes<br>

	They made us fight fight fight at night <br>
<br>
	They made us fight at night<br>
	They made us fight at night<br>
	It really was insane<br>
	We hit both friends and foes<br>
	And never saw the blows<br>
	The whole idea was lame<br>

	I really don't know why<br>
	I swung at a shadow<br>
	And gave myself a killing blow<br>
	It made me want to cry<br>

	I don't want to die<br>
	At the the last double war <br>
	I got mad and really sore<br>
	Every time I tried to attack<br>
	I'd get hit with an arrow in the back<br>
<br>
	Please mister archer<br>
	I want a chance to fight<br>
	Have pity mister archer <br>
	After all I am a knight  <br>
	There's a shield wall over there<br>
	Just asking for my care<br>
	I just want at least one swing <br>
	Before I hear another arrow go ca-ching<br>
<br>
	Please mister archer <br>
	I'll do  most anything<br>
	Please mister archer<br>
	I'll even stand still for the Queen<br>	
	I'm a warrior tough and mean<br>
	But that don't mean a thing<br>
	If after each resurrection I find <br>
	I step on the field and become a porcupine<br>
<br>
	Please mister archer <br>
	I see you hiding by that tree<br>
	Please mister archer <br>
	Why do you always pick on me?<br>
	I just want to kill a few  <br>
	Before this war is through <br>
	How about if I bribe you? <br>
	Ten minutes of fighting for a case of Mountain Dew<br>
