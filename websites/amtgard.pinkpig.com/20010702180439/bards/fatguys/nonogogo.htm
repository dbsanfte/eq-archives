At an Event last Jan, Iset up a Fat Guy encampment at one side of the site. We had a large tent,portable fireplace, Beer table, Several cases of Beer, a case of singlemalt scotch, soft drinks. etc. We had lots of fun and good times. So didmost of those who visited the camp. But one lady, took offense at my song&quot;the Codpiece&quot; and complained for weeks afterwards to many peers that itwasn't right since we had the only encampment at the site. Totally ignoringthe fact that the feast hall was open all night. When this was finallybrought to my attention a few weeks latter, my reaction was &quot;So?.&quot; Thecommon response from the peers was &quot;What did you expect?, it was Fat GuyCamp.&quot; (I love living in Drachenwald). But it got me to thinking, what if Iwas pushing-for-a-peerage and had to &quot;clean up my act&quot; to please the peers.What could save me from such a respectable fate? At the Last Celtic Sheepand Garter Raids, the Fat Guy Wench and another lady pulled off drive byschmoozings with a cloven fruit at all the encampments. If that wouldn'treconvert somebody to Fun, I don't know what would.<p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="axeandmace.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Just Use an Axe and Mace)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="getalife.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Get a Life says the Baron)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">25</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
