The battles are based oncollecting as many sheep as you can defend. Also during the Event, theladies can buy White, Red, or Black garters the present to Lords for actsdone during the event. White ones are for courtesy and chivalry. Black onesare dastardly deeds. Red ones are for romantic deeds. Who ever collects themost of one color wins a medallion that they must wear for the next year.<p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="pelican.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (I'm in Love with a Pelican)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="noelfears.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (No Elf Ears in the SCA)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">50</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
