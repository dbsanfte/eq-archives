The candle by which he wrote flickered in the slight wind thatpassed through the quiet room.  A relaxing end to a long day, he thought.<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">A rustling could be heard from outside.  Mestoph paused, listening.The door swung wildly open, banging against the wall as Dar rushed into theroom, out of breath.<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">Mestoph stood up quickly, "What's wrong?"<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">"It's back, Mestoph!", Dar exclaimed.<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">Quickly, and without another word, Mestoph grabbed his sword andshield, then rushed outside, Dar following closely behind.  Taking thetelescope from Dar's hands, Mestoph looked up into the sky.  What he sawwas not how he was hoping to end his day.<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">Gracefully flying through the air, an Azure Dragon swiftly made itsway towards the small Shire that it had been attacking for over a week now.Mestoph took several moments examining the dragon.  From this distance, itseemed to be smaller than stories have told, perhaps a dragon which has notyet attained adulthood, but when he saw the flash of lightning come from thecreatures powerful jaw, he knew that it was dangerous enough.<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">"Call together the Tempestarii and the local militia, Dar.  We willbe needing their-", Mestoph stopped as his eyes befell another creaturecoming through the darkness, the likes of which he had never seen before.<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">Walking slowly up to the shire was what appeared to be a scarecrow,but this scarecrow was definitely out of the ordinary.<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">"What is it?" asked Dar.<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">"I will go off to face the Dragon myself, Dar."<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">"You're mad!"<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">"No, Dar" Mestoph said as he pointed to the scarecrow.  "There isa creature heading towards the town.  I don't know what it is but is nearlyhere, and will be in striking range much sooner than the dragon.  I willgo to face the dragon now, the rest of you take care of that thing.  Onceyou do, post the militia on watch and bring the Tempestarii to me to aidme.  I will be fine until then."<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">"Are you sure?"<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">"Yes." Mestoph replied.<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">Dar furrowed his brow at Mestoph, "You truly are insane, do yourealize that?"<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">Mestoph smiled slightly, "Don't worry, Dar.  I have a plan.  Justremember to come and get me when you are finished here, alright?"<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">Dar sighed, shook his head, then was off to gather the others.Mestoph looked around, making sure that these were the only two menaces,and then quickly headed off to the house of a local wizard named Jesper.<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">After a few moments of stressfull knocking, Jesper opened up his door.        "Oh, it's you.  What do you want?" he asked.<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">"A dragon is heading this way, and I need your services to help mewith -- "<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">"Come in!" Jesper interrupted.<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">Mestoph entered the elabourately decorated home, emerging a few momentslater with his shield enchanted.  With greater confidance now, Mestoph lookedto the left where the scarecrow had entered the town, meeting the Tempestarii.He turned to the direction of the quickly closing dragon.<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">"I hope you're watching over me today, father..." Mestoph whispered,and then quickly headed off into the woods.<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">It wasn't long before he could see the underbelly of the great beastnearly overtop of him.  It was flying low, just over the trees.  He climbed upone of them, his shield strapped to his back, and he threw a stone at thedragon to get its attention.<p><img src="tab.gif" alt="">Missing the dragon entirely, Mestoph had thought he would have todouble back to try again, but then the dragon saw him, and came swoopingdown to the ground.  Mestoph jumped down from the tree and readied his swordand shield.<P><img src="tab.gif" alt="">"This is as close as you will get to the Shire, dragon.  You shallharm the inhabitants no more!" shouted Mestoph.<P><img src="tab.gif" alt="">A great laugh roared from the belley of the creature.  Mestophexamined it closely, it's blue scales shimmering in the moonlight, itsgreat pearly teeth, and its obsidian eyes.  The impressions it made in thenew snow were larger than a warboard, and Mestoph was afraid.<P><img src="tab.gif" alt="">"Do you think you can stop me human?  A frail, little creature likeyourself?"  the dragon laughed again, "Look at you!  Hiding behind your littleshield.  I will devour you slowly, and make you suffer for your stupidity."<P><img src="tab.gif" alt="">The dragon opened it's mouth and took a deep breath.  Mestophsteadied himself and wiped the beads of sweat from his head.  With a mightycrack the dragon had hurled a lightning bolt at Mestoph, who then flew a fewfeet back into a tree.  The dragon looked at Mestoph, who was relativelyunharmed, and its eyes widened.<P><img src="tab.gif" alt="">Another deep breath and another bolt of light shot towards Mestoph,but again Mestoph stood unharmed.<P><img src="tab.gif" alt="">"This is as close as you will get to the Shire, dragon." Mestophrepeated himself.<P><img src="tab.gif" alt="">"It would seem that my breath is ineffective against that shield,so I shall just have to rend it from your pitiful body!" the dragonexclaimed, just before leaping at Mestoph.<P><img src="tab.gif" alt="">Mestoph jerked to the side, narrowly avoiding the charge, but managedto connect a good swing to the side of the dragon.  Blood dripped from anuninspiringly small wound in the creature's side.  The dragon stared atits side for a moment, and Mestoph stood, watching.<P><img src="tab.gif" alt="">With the speed of a demon, the dragon swung wildly at Mestoph,hurling him several feet into a tree.  Mestoph slumped to the ground, hisleg broken, the dragon looming over him.<P><img src="tab.gif" alt="">"Looks pretty bad, human.  It's a shame you won't be able to learnfrom your mistakes..."<P><img src="tab.gif" alt="">Mestoph gritted his teeth and rolled out of the way as the dragonlunged for him.  "I don't die so easily lizard!"  With a strength he didn'tknow he possessed, Mestoph swung at the dragon, his sword biting deeplyinto its arm.<P><img src="tab.gif" alt="">As the blood trickled down it, the dragon staggered back.  Mestophgot up, propping himself up with his sword.  He made his way towards thestunned creature.  As he approached, the dragon attempted to strike himwith another lightning bolt.  This, too, hit the shield, and sent Mestophcrashing to the ground, fighting to stay conscious through the pain.<P><img src="tab.gif" alt="">The dragon lumbered towards Mestoph, who lay in the snow.  Itstood overtop of him, looking down.  It slowly raised its massive footand as it did Mestoph focused himself and struck out, cutting off a toe.The dragon screamed, and as it did, Mestoph sliced at its belly, wounding itfurther.  He swung again, and again, pouring all his anger and energytowards it.  With one final swing he raked the chest, blood and scalesflying off.<P><img src="tab.gif" alt="">His energy depleted, Mestoph could do nothing but stare at thedragon. It stared back at him, and slowly fell to the ground.  The bloodseeping from its body stained the area, and Mestoph stared blankly intothe distance.  As his vision left him, he saw the foggy vision of hiscompany members rushing to him.  Mestoph slumped to the ground, unconscious.<P><img src="tab.gif" alt="">Hours later he awoke to a friendly face.<P><img src="tab.gif" alt="">"How are you feeling, Mest?" asked Dar.<P><img src="tab.gif" alt="">"Could be a whole lot better." he replied.    <p><BR><BR>  <CENTER><I>Fini</I></CENTER><P align ="right">By Mestoph<br>Friday, December 06, 1996<p><a href="index.html"><IMG SRC="harp2.gif" border=0 alt="Back to the Bard's Guild"><br>Back to the Bard's Guild!</a></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY>
