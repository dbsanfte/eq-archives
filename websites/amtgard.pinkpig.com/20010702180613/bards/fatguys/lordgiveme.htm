When Iread them, I added three more.There was another discussion going on about Royal visits at  remote sites.I know some people who have been waiting for 3 or more years to get their devises passed. The 4th verse I started, and Lord Niall improved. I have come across many folks who have not gotten their AoA's mainlybecause every one assumes that they already have one. <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="rounds.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Fat Guy Rounds)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="drunkensquire.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (What do you do with a Drunken Squire?)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">70</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
