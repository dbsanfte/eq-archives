your eyes to a situation you do not wish  to acknowledge, Or you are not aware of the caliber of disaster... indicated by the  presence of a beer tavern in your community. Well, ya got trouble my friends, I say trouble right here in Calafia. Why sure I'm a storyteller, I'm always mighty proud, I say I'm mighty  proud to say it. I consider that the hours I've spent in front of a crowd are golden... Helped me cultivate horse sense, and a cool head and a keen eye. Ya ever try to give an iron clad leave to yourself from a royal command  performance?   But just as I say it takes judgement, brains and maturity to get a harp  argent for singing sixteenth century sea shanties, I say that any boob... Can get drunk and murder the lyrics to a Broadway showtune... And I call that sloth. And the first big step on the road to the depths of degrada[tion]... I  say first... medicinal wine from a teaspoon, then beer from a keg. And the next thing you know your son's singing filks and wearing a  cavalier hat, And listening to some egotistical Norman, here to tell all about  country dancing,  Not a wholesome courtly dance, No!, but a dance where you actually  touch your partner's hands. Ya like to see some big, ugly Welshman drooling on Your daughter's arm,  make your blood boil, well I should say...   Now friends, let me tell you what I mean... Ya got one, two, five, ten, fifteen, twenty ounces in a pint. Ounces that mark the difference between a nobleman and a tinker, With a capital 'T', and that rhymes with 'B', and that stands for Beer. And all week long your Calafian youth'll be piddling away, I say your  young men'll be piddling.... Piddling away their noon-time, supper-time, chore-time too, Just get the beer in the tankard Never mind getting the dandelions pulled, the tent flap patched or the  beefsteak pounded. Never mind hauling any water 'til you parents are caught with the  dishes all dirty on a Saturday night And that's trouble. Oh, yes we've got lots and lots trouble I'm thinking of smalls in their little clothes, shirt tail young ones, peeking in the tavern window after sundown Trouble! Folks! Right here in Calafia! Gotta find a way to keep the young ones moral after all. Now, I know all you folk are the right kind of parents, So I'll be perfectly frank with you. Would you like to know what sort of conversation goes on when they're loafin' around that tavern? They'll be puttin' down Guinness; they'll be puttin' down Blackbush;  Drinking that Connemara Dew like alcohol fiends! And braggin' all about how they're gonna cover up a telltale breath  with a bit of raw clove, One fine night, they leave the tavern, headed for the dance in Bedlam, Libertine men and scarlet women and belly dancing with shameless music That will grab your son, your daughter, in the arms of a jungle animal  instinct. Mass hysteria! Friends, the idle brain is the devils playground, Trouble! (Oh! We got trouble!) Right here in Calafia! (Right here in Calafia!) Trouble with a capital 'T', and that rhymes with 'B', and that stands  for Beer. (That stands for beer!) Oh yes, we've got trouble. (Our children have got trouble!) Right here in Calafia! (Right here!) Remember the code of chivalry and the golden rule. Mothers of Calafia. Heed this warning before it's too late. Watch for the telltale signs of corruption. When your son leaves the pavilion, does he roll his sleeves up above  the elbow? Is there a disgusting sludge in the bottom of his tankard that looks  like it came from an Exxon spill? Is there a book of Irish folk songs hidden under his pillow? Is he starting to memorize jokes, and one-liners that the peerage  would never approve of? Are certain ideas creeping into his mind? Ideas like, "Who cares if I never get an award.... ever." And, "The king's an idiot!" Aha! And, "Big deal if I get banished!" Well, if so my friends, You got trouble! (Oh! We got trouble!) Right here in Calafia! (Right here in Calafia!) That drink with water and the barley and the hops is the devils tool. (The devil's tool.) Yes, we've got trouble, trouble,
