Every time I find it, it's under a different title, or a different artist.  I have found it, variously, as "The Ball of Kerrymuir," "Four and Twenty Virgins," "The Ball of Ballyknure," and "Gathering of the Clans."  I have seen it listed as Traditional, and by various artists, even  Jim Croce! (On his "Jim Croce Live: The Final Tour" album)   <p>Suffice to say, one thing holds true through every incarnation: it's probably the bawdiest of the filk/folk genre, and is certainly <b>not appropriate for younger listeners</b>.<p>The version I have here is the most complete I've seen, and also appears to be more traditional, due to the spelling and grammar.<p>This can be sung in many different ways - this arrangement is by no means intended to be definitive.<p></font><center><font face="Bard", "Lucida Blackletter", "Arial" size=7>The Ball of Kerrimuir
