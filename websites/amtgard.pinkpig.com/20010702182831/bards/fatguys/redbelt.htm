Some choices are obvious; some are not. Many times folks speculate why is it taking so long for some. Being an old timer, I’ve picked up more than a little of how the process works. In general, the different peerage circles, will err on the side of caution, if here is any doubt. This song started out with the first verse. I try not to do serious songs, but with this song I could not help it. Some songs truly write themselves, and I found myself in trapped in the mind of an aging Knight asking himself his young Squire was ready or not.  Not having been the position, I am not sure if I got it correct or not, but it feels right. In any case, it gives me something polite to sing at vigil fire.    <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="thankgod.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (At Times I Thank God for the SCA)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="pelicancan.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (A Pelican Can)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">102</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
