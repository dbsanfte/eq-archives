There was a Squire here in Drachenwald whoused to ocassionally say &quot;I am Libido Man, .....&quot; He used to work with thecurrent Baron. I thought the song would be sure to get a laugh.<p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="prothal.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Sir Prothal's Lament)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="saintkarl.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Saint Karl)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">29</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
