I never have understood the mind sets of either those that suck up or those who allow themselves to be sucked up to.  Hat chasers are normally doomed to failure. Even if they gain the titles they are coveting, it does <B>not</B> gain them the respect they assume will come with the titles. Some of most hateful things I have ever heard, has been from one hat chaser talking about another. There is nothing wrong with a little ambition, and a majority of status in the SCA is gained by getting titles. But what the Hat Chasers consistently fail to recognize is that today's &quot;Title-less Scum&quot; may be tomorrow's Peer. When someone who would not give them the time of day, all the sudden is trying to be their best friend, it's a little obvious.   <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="7aps.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (7 A.P.s)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="glorious.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Glorious, Glorious)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">84</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
