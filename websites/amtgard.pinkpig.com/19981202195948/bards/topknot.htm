air<br>Up ahead in the distance<br>I saw a smiling face<br>My head grew heavy & my sight grew dim<br>I had arrived at the place<br>There they stood at the gateway<br>I paid the entrance fee<br>And I was thinking to myself<br>Is this the place that's right for me?<br>Then they gave me a weapon<br>And they pointed the way<br>There were people ditching all night long<br>I thought I heard them say<p><ul>Welcome to the Kingdom of the Wetlands<br>Such a humid place<br>(such a humid place)<br>Such a soggy place<br>Plenty of drinks in the Kingdom of the Wetlands<br>Any time of year<br>(any time of year)<br>You can party here<p></ul>Their minds are focused on fighting<br>They're glad to spar with you<br>They've got a lot of artisans<br>I could be one, too<br>How they ditch in the daytime<br>And party at night<br>Some sing in the bardics<br>Some just want to fight<br>So I met with the Monarch<br>"Please tell me I'm right"<br>He said<br>"We will always welcome new members, to sew or to fight"<br>And still those voices are calling from far away<br>Wake you up in the middle of the night<br>Just to hear them say<p><ul>Welcome to the Kingdom of the Wetlands<br>Such a humid place<br>(such a humid place)<br>Such a soggy place<br>They're livin' it up in the Kingdom of the Wetlands<br>What a friendly crew<br>(what a friendly crew)<br>Now I live here too<p></ul>Wizards throwing spellballs<br>Warriors in steel<br>And she said<br>"You can choose to sing as a bard<br>To fight, or to heal"<br>And in the covered pavilion<br>They gathered for the feast<br>They sing the praises of the populace<br>From north, south, west, & east.<p>Next thing I remember<br>I was talking with some guy<br>I tried to think of what I would do if I had to say goodbye<br>"Relax" said my new friend<br>"Though your absence we will grieve,<br>You can join another Kingdom<br>But you never truly leave"<p align="right">December 9, 1997, By
