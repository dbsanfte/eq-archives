Paddy's Lament</H3>Dear sir, I write this note to you, to tell you of my plight.<BR>For at the time of writing I am not a pretty sight.<BR>My body is all black and blue, my face a deathly grey,<BR>And I write this note to say why Paddy's not at work today.<BR><p>While working on the castle wall, some bricks I had to clear.<BR>To throw them down from such a height seemed quite a good idea.<BR>The bailiff was not very pleased, the bloody awkward sod<BR>And he said I'd have to cart them down the ladder in my hod.<BR><p>Now clearing all these bricks by hand, it seemed so very slow.<BR>So I hoisted up a barrel and secured the rope below.<BR>But in my haste to do the job, I was too blind to see<BR>That a barrel full of building bricks is heavier than me.<BR><p>And so, when I untied the rope, the barrel fell like lead.<BR>And clinging tightly to the rope, I started up instead.<BR>I shot up like a rocket till to my dismay I found,<BR>That halfway up I met the bloody barrel coming down.<BR><p>The barrel broke my shoulder as towards the ground it sped,<BR>And when I reached the top, I banged the pulley with my head.<BR>I hung on tightly, numb with shock, from this almighty blow,<BR>And the barrel spilled out half its bricks some forty feet below.<BR><p>Now when those bricks had fallen from the barrel to the floor, <BR>I then outweighed the barrel and so started down once more.<BR>Still clinging tightly to the rope, my body wracked with pain,<BR>When halfway down I met that bloody barrel once again.<BR><p>The force of this collision, halfway up that castle block,<BR>Caused multiple abrasions and a nasty state of shock.<BR>Still clinging tightly to the rope, I fell towards the ground<BR>And I landed on the broken bricks the barrel'd scattered round.<BR><p>I lay there groaning on the ground, I thought I'd past the worst;<BR>But the barrel hit the pulley wheel, and then the bottom burst.<BR>A shower of bricks rained down on me, I hadn't got a hope,<BR>And in the mass confusion I let go the bloody rope.<BR><p>The barrel was now free to fall and it started down once more<BR>And landed right across me as I lay there on the floor.<BR>It broke three ribs, and my left arm, and I can only say<BR>That I hope you understand why Paddy's not at work today.<BR><p><A NAME="dough"><HR></A><center><h3>Dough -  For beer</h3> <h4>by Effin Wlystie<br>(version and author's name submitted by Earl Sir Timmoch Haakonson ofNordheim via Lord Gorlan of the Redlands)</h4></center><p>Dough - The stuff that buys my beer<br>Ray - The guy who sells me beer<br>Me - I think I'll have a beer<br>Far  - A long way to the john<br>So - lets have another beer<br>La - (All gentils stare at each other across the fire with puzzled lookson their faces and scratching their heads for a few seconds)<br>La - lets have another beer!<br>Tea - no thanks, I'll have another beer <br>Which will bring us back to Dough<p>	Alternate last two verses <p>Te - I think we're out of beer<br>Which will mean we need more Dough<p>Do, re, me fa, so, la, te, Beer. <p><HR><!-Begin table of links-><TABLE><TR><TD><CENTER><A HREF="filidx.htm"><img border = 0 src ="treble.gif"></A></CENTER></TD><TD><center><A HREF="index.htm"><img border = 0 src = "harp2.gif"></a></center></TD></TR><TR><TD><CENTER><A HREF="filkidx.htm">Back to the Song Index</A></CENTER></TD><TD><center><A HREF="index.htm">Back to the Bard's Page</a></center></TD></TR></TABLE> </body></html>
