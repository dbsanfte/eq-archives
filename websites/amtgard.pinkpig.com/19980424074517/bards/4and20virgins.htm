<font face="Arial">This song is one of those that I can't seem to get any definitive information on.  Every time I find it, it's under a different title, or a different artist.  I have found it, variously, as "The Ball of Kerrymuir," "Four and Twenty Virgins," "The Ball of Ballyknure," and "Gathering of the Clans."  I have seen it listed as Traditional, and by various artists, even  Jim Croce! (On his "Jim Croce Live: The Final Tour" album)   
<p>Suffice to say, one thing holds true through every incarnation: it's probably the bawdiest of the filk/folk genre, and is certainly <b>not appropriate for younger listeners</b>.
<p>
The version I have here is the most complete I've seen, and also appears to be more traditional, due to the spelling and grammar.
<p>
This can be sung in many different ways - this arrangement is by no means intended to be definitive.

Oh the Ball, the Ball of Ballyknure.<BR>
Where your wife, and my wife, were doin' it on the floor!..<BR>
<BR>
Four and twenty virgins went down to Inverness.<BR>
And when the Ball was over, there were four and twenty less!..<BR>

<b>(CHORUS): Singin' balls to your partners,<BR>
 Arse agin' th' wall!.<BR>
