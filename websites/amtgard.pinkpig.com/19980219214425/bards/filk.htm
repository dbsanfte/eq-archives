           -Ewan MacColl  I'm a free-born man of the travelin' people.  Got no fixed abode, with nomads I have wandered.  Country lanes an' byways  Were always my ways.  I never fancied bein' 'cumbered.  Oh, we knew the woods and the restin' places,  And the small birds sang when winter days were over.  Then we'll pack our load,  And be on the road.  Those were the good old days for a rover.  There was open ground where a man could linger  For a week or two, for time was not our master.  Then away we'd jog,  With our horse and dog.  Nice and easy, no need to go faster.  Now I've known life hard, and I've known it easy,  And I've cursed the life when winter days were dawning.  But I've laughed and sung  Thru the whole night long.  Seen the summer's sunrise in the morning.  All ye free born men of the traveling people,  Every tinker, rollin' stone, and gypsy rover,  Winds of change are blowin',  Old ways are goin'.  Your travelin' days will soon be over. <hr>      <A NAME="mattie"><H4>MATTIE GROVES</H4></a>                   -Traditional   One high, one high, one holiday     The best day of the year   Young Mattie Groves to church did go,     Some holy words to hear.   Well, the first to enter was the lady in white,     the next the lady in blue   The last to come was Lord Arlen's wife,     a flower among the few.   She cast her eye on Mattie Groves,     Young Mattie Groves on she   What would you give my fine young man     to spend one night with me?   I dare not come, I dare not go,     I dare not for my life   For I see by the little ring you wear,     you're the great Lord Arlen's wife.   So what if I am Lord Arlen's wife,     I can't deny it all   He is gone to consecrate     King Henry at Whitehall.   Oh pray, oh pray, come with me stay     I'll hide thee out of sight   I'll serve you there beyond compare     And sleep with you the night   Well, a little page was standing by,     he took to his heels and run   He run till he come to the waterside,     he bent his breast and swum.   What news, what news, my little page,     is my castle burning down   Or is my lady brought to bed     of a daughter or a son.   No, your castle it is not burning down,     you have no daughter or son   But Mattie Groves has bedded your wife,     they lie as they were one.   No harm has come to your house and land     The little page did say   But Mattie Groves is bedded up     With your fair Lady gay   Lord Arlen called his merry men     He bade them with him go   He bade them never a word to speak     And never a horn to blow   But among Lord Arlen's merry men     Was one who wished no ill   And the bravest lad in all the crew     Blew his horn both loud and shrill   What's this, what's this cried Mattie Groves     What's this that I do hear   It must be Lord Arlen and his men     It gives me cause to fear   I think I hear the morning cock     I think I hear the jay   I think I hear Lord Arlen's men     And I must be away   Lie down, lie down, Young Mattie Groves     And keep my back from cold   It's only Lord Arlen's merry men     Calling the sheep to fold   Is not your hawk upon his perch?     Your horse eats oats and hay   And I am lying in your arms     And would'st thou be away?   Young Mattie Groves he did lie down     And took a nap asleep   And when he woke, Lord Arlen was     A-standing at his feet   Well, it had not been about two hours,     I'm sure it was not three   When Lord Arlen appeared in their chamber,     standing at their feet.   And how do you like my pillows, Milord?     and how do you like my sheets?   And how do you like my fair young wife     who lies in your arms asleep?   It's well that I like your pillows, Milord,     it's well that I like your sheets   But it's best that I love your fair young wife,     who lies in my arms asleep   Rise up, rise up, Young Mattie Groves,     as fast as e're you can   It'll ne'er be said in the morning sun     I slew a naked man.   Oh, I can't get up, I won't get up,     I dare not for me life   For at your side hang two broadswords     and I have nary a knife   If at my side hang two broadswords     they cost me deep in purse   But you shall have the better of the two,     and I shall have the worst   And you will strike me the very first blow,      Oh, strike it like a man   And I will strike the very next blow      and kill you if I can   The very first blow that Mattie struck     he struck Lord Arlen sore   The second blow Lord Arlen struck,     Young Mattie struck no more.   He's taken his lady by the hand     and placed her on his knee   Saying "Who do you like the best, my dear,     Young Mattie Groves or me?"   It's well that I like your rosy red cheeks,     it's well that I like your chin   But it's best that I love Young Mattie Groves,     than you or all your kin.   He's taken her by the lily white hand     and led her through the hall   He's taken her to an upper room     and killed her before them all.   Go place these lovers in one grave,     go place them deep within   But place my lady on the top,     for she's of a nobler kin.   This sad mischance for lust was wrought     Then let us call for grace   That we may shun this wicked vice     And mend our lives apace.     NB: This is a compilation of the best verses from all the versions      I have heard. Sing it in free rhythm, and take your time, and BE      DRAMATIC and you will hold your listeners -spellbound.-            It is an incredibly powerful song.<hr><A NAME="anguskilt">         <h4>ANGUS AND THE KILT</h4></a>                 -Lolly Foy         (c) 1991 Lolly Foy   (Tune: works OK to "Sleeping Scotsman," but has          a tune of it's own, too.) Now Angus was a happy man for soon he would be wed He'd found a brisk and bonnie lass to take him to his bed But happier still his mother was that he had found a wife For truth be told she'd often feared t'be stuck with him for life! In honor of the grand affair their wedding it would be She set about to weave a kilt the finest ever seen The night before the wedding when the kilt was finally done She called young Angus over and she tried it on her son She wound the kilt about him and she wound and wound and wound! But when she'd finished winding it was still eight yards too long "Oh never fear, me bonnie boy, we'll simply cut it off, And to your blushing bride we will give the extra cloth." Now Angus was so pleased you know his heart it swelled with pride He felt that he must rush right out to show it to his bride It was raining so he grabbed a cloak to shield him on the moor And in his haste to be away, his kilt slammed in the door! Now Angus was in such a rush to show off for his bride He never really noticed that he'd left his kilt behind He knocked upon her door, cryin' "Let me in I pray, I've something that you've got to see before our wedding day" Well Brigit let him in you know but says, "You cannot stay. For I must have my beauty sleep before our wedding day!" "I'll only be a moment love, but it's so grand, my dear, You've really got t'see what I've got hidin' under here!" Now when the cloak was set aside, and Angus stood quite bare We must admit, she was impressed, and tried not hard to stare "My love, I'll ne'er see finer, though far and wide I'd roam!" "Oh, lass," he cried, "That's nothin'! I've eight more yards at home!"<hr><A NAME="countrylife">             <h4>   THE COUNTRY LIFE</h4></a>                       -Traditional     I like to rise when the sun she rises    Early in the morning    I like to hear them small birds singing    Merrily upon their lay-land    And hurrah for the life of a country boy    And to ramble in the new mown hay    In the spring we sow, in the harvest mow    That's how the seasons around they go    But of all the times if choose I may    It's to ramble on the new mown hay    In the winter when the sky is grey    We edge and we ditch our time away    But in the summer when the sun shines gay    We go rambling in the new mown hay<hr><A NAME="elric">                         <h4> ELRIC THE AWFUL</h4></a>                            -Ray StevensWay back in history along the Nordic coastthat was the sound all the people feared the mostIt would echo thru the night up and down the foggy fj-ordIt was Elric and the bloodthirsty Horde!Chorus: Elric the Awful, the Brutal and Tenacious        Elric the Awful, the Ruthless and Courageous        Subtle as a chainsaw, lacking all the Social Graces        You can run, but you cannot hide!YES! And as the oars of the sleek, fierce Viking ship cut thru the water like knives thru the fog-shrouded Nordic sea, transporting the wild, marauding band of Viking heathens stealthily towards their unsuspecting, slumberingvictims, there he stood, on the foredeck, Elric the Awful, the wildest, bloodthirstiest Viking of them all!(his Momma named him Elric 'cause she couldn't spell AHHGGGRRRFFFFLLLLQQHH!)He had a hairy head, a hairy face, hairy chest, hairy legs, hairy boots and a hairy hat, shaped like a big bullet with horns comin' out the sides.....and once he started after ya he'd NEVER stop! He'd turn to his oarsmen in his 37 oared fj-ord and he'd say: "MORDEN BORDEN FJORDEN GORDEN!" which was Viking for:             "YA-HOO!!!!!, RAVAGE, PILLAGE, PLUNDER,         MAIM AND PUT BIG HICKEYS ON ALL THEM FAIR DAMSELS!"Chorus: And it was Elric the Awful, the Brutal and Tenacious        Elric the Awful, mercy sakes! and goodness gracious!        His appetite for slaughter was simply voracious        You gotta sleep with your sneakers by your side!YES! And when the villagers heard that awful battle-cry:                        * YA-HOOOOOOOOOOO! *That's the one! They would run for their lives, fleeing over hills andthru valleys to the river, whereupon they would walk mid-stream for 37 and 1/2 miles, climbing out on the low-lying branch, shinnying down a young saplingonto rocky ground and leaping from stone to stone until they arrived one week later at a secret cave 97 miles away, and as they sat down for the first time to catch their breath, outside they heard:                "YA-HOOOO!!!! MORDEN BORDEN FJORDEN GORDEN!"Chorus: Yes, it was Elric the Awful, the Brutal and Tenacious        Elric the Awful, turned up in the darndest places        Subtle as a chainsaw, lacking all the Social Graces        You can run, but you cannot hide!OH! And this time they cut south to Paris, bought tickets on the Orient Express to Istanbul, hired a U-Haul to the Coast, jumped a Greek freighteracross the Mediterranian Sea to MON-golia, hooked up with a camel caravan into the heart of the Gobi Desert, and as they paused at an oasis, to lift one handful of cool water to their parched lips, over their shoulder they heard:                "YA-HOOOO!!!! MORDEN BORDEN FJORDEN GORDEN!"They fled to Calcutta!                                  * YA-HOOOOOOOO! *They fled to the Himalayas!                                * YA-HOOOOOOOO! *Tokyo!                                * YA-HOOOOOOOO! *Toronto!                                * YA-HOOOOOOOO! *Toledo and Heyhailea, Georgia.....                                * YA-HOOOOOOOO! *But it was no use! They finally succumbed to a savage plundering and pillaging followed by a big hickey party on the outskirts of what is now Washington, DC, where the decendants of Elric can still be found today, working as Special Agents for the IRS!Elric later amassed a small fortune posing for Molly Hatchet album covers, and did stuntwork for Arnold Schwartzenegger in Conan the Barbarian! He also won an Academy Award for his dual role as a train wreck and his tender portrayal of King Kong's daddy! Oh, you might remember the end of that one:there wasn't a dry eye in the house when he married the Empire State Building.And who could forget the evening he ate the entire Kingdom of the East?With no sugar?Chorus: Elric the Awful, the Brutal and Tenacious        Elric the Awful, the Hungry and Voracious        Subtle as a chainsaw, lacking all the Social Graces        You can run but you cannot hide!        * YA-HOOOOOOOOOOO! *<hr><A NAME="highwayman"><h4>                 THE HIGHWAYMAN</h4></a>                 Lyrics: Alfred Noyes                  Melody: Phil Ochs              Em                    G        C         The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees,              Em                G         C                  D         The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas              Em                   G        Cd         The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,                  Em              G       B7      Em         And the highwayman came riding, riding, riding-             C                G      C                  D         The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn door.Over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn yardAnd he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred;He whistled a tune to the window and who should be waiting thereBut the landlord's black eyed daughter, Bess, the landlord's daughterPlaiting a red love-knot into her long black hair."One kiss, my bonny sweetheart, I'm after a prize tonight,But I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light;Yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day,Then look for me by moonlight, watch for me by moonlight,I will come to thee by moonlight, though Hell should bar the way."He did not come in the dawning; he did not come at noon;And out of the tawny sunset, before the rise of the moon,When the road was a gypsy's ribbon, looping the purple moor,A red-coat troop came marching, marching, marching-King George's men came marching, up to the old inn door.They tied her up to attention, with many a sickening jest,And they bound a musket beside her, with the barrel to her breast."Now keep good watch!" and they kissed her.  She heard the dead man say,"Look for me by moonlight, watch for me by moonlight,I will come to thee by moonlight, though Hell should bar the way.""Look for me by moonlight."  The hoof-beats ringing clear."Watch for me by moonlight."  Were they deaf they did not hear?Her eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath,Then her finger moved in the moonlight, her musket shattered the moonlightShattered her breast in the moonlight, and warned him - with her death.He turned, he spurred him westward; he did not know who stoodBowed with her head o'er the musket, drenched with her own red blood.Not 'til the dawn he heard it; his face grew gray to hearHow Bess, the landlord's daughter, the landlord's black-eyed daughter,Had watched for her love by moonlight, and died in the darkness there.Back he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky,With the white road smoking behind him, and his rapier brandished high!Blood red were his spurs in the golden noon, wine-red was his velvet coat,When they shot him down on the highway, with a bunch of lace at his throat.And still of a winter's night, they say, when the wind is in the treesWhen the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,When the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,A highwayman comes riding, riding, riding-A highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn door.<hr><A NAME="violence"><H4>

old friend     I've come to fight with you again     Because the sounds of battle ringing     In my ears has me singing     And the rock that I have instead of a brain     Still remains     I love the sounds of violence     In tournaments I fight alone     I leave my melee gear at home     But when I go down to the Pennsic War     I often fight in groups of five or more     When my

from the second row     Shieldmen dying, they're the first to go     Two-stick fighters can harry the enemy flank     They've got rank     And love the sounds of violence     Foolishly I pressed ahead     I'd be a hero or be dead     A belted fighter tried to teach me     With his polearm he might reach me     But my blows like violent hailstones fell     And struck well     Causing the

-Anonymous  A charming master minstrel came travelling South one day  Dressed he was in robes so fine, bright with colors gay  And when he arrived at the inn where he had planned to stay  He called to the serving wench and to her did say  "Fetch me down some ale to drink for my throat is dusty!  For it would never never do if my voice were rusty!  Do be sure the sheets are clean and the room's not musty  Come a little nearer, dear, you seem a wench most lusty!"  The wench then did as she was bid and served a dinner fine  The minstrel ate and then he called for a flagon full of wine  Ans while he drained the flagon full he called the wench divine  And as in answer to his prayers the wench brought him more wine  The minstrel drank his wine more ribald grew his songs  The wench did leave the minstrels side...but not for very long!  Coming back she brought more wine, how could she do wrong?  If the minstrel matched his songs he was very, very strong!  The hour grew late and still the minstrel did not seem to tire  All his songs had done to her was stoke her passion higher!  And at last the room was full and dying was the fire  "Four o'clock and alls well" sang the town's crier  Suddenly the minstrel tired and needed help to bed  He called to the serving wench and to her he said  "Walk before me with the candle for I must be led  For my senses, like the wine, seemingly are fled!"  Then she led him to a room that had been set aside  Wondering about his sudden needing of a guide  Thinking about all the wine which he had imbibed  Ardently she hoped the songs about him hadn't lied  The wench did turn her back to him and closed the chamber door  The minstrel then did fall in bed and he began to snore  To herself she said as she looked for wine to pour  "To this man I should have served less wine instead of more.."  Now I've come to the end and moral of this tale  Ladies if you'd like to spend your evening without fail  And you do not wish to hear him snoring like a whale  Limit then his intake of spirits, wine and ale!<hr><A NAME="fifteen"><h4>         FIFTEEN MEN ON A DEAD MAN'S CHEST</h4></a>
