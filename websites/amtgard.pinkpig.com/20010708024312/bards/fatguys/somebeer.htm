Fat Guys do not as a rule do not go anywhere fast, unless there is a shield wall and combat  involved. So as I was slowly trudging up the hill, Luke the Fool came past singing the first line of the Chorus. I am not sure if he was taunting me or was suggesting we go back to the camp for some beer. You can never tell with Luke.  <p></TD></tr><TR><p><TD></TD><TD></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="gorlanslament.htm"><img src="greysql.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Previous Page (Gorlan's Lament)" border=0><br>Previous page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="index.html"><img src="greysqh.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Contents" border=0><br>Index</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=50><CENTER><a href="heyhey.htm"><img src="greysqr.gif" height=30 width=30 alt="Next Page (Hey, Hey, We're the Fatguys!)" border=0><br>Next Page</a></CENTER></TD><TD align=right width=10><FONT SIZE="5" FACE="Olde English, Bard">74</FONT></TD></TR></table></body></html>
