Ball, the Ball of Kerriemur,<BR>Where your wife an his wife were doin it on the floor...<BR><BR>'Twas on the first of August, the party, it began.<BR>Now, never shall I forget, me lads, the gatherin' of the clans...<BR><BR>Singin--- Who hae ye lassie, Who hae ye noo?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tha mon wha hae ye last nicht, He cannae hae ye noo.<BR><BR>'Twas the gatherin' o' the clans, and everyone was there,<BR>A-playin wi' tha lassies, an' twinin curly hairs...<BR><BR>Four an twenty virgins, came down from Inverness<BR>An when tha Ball were o'er there were four and twenty less...<BR><BR>John McGowan, the father, was very surprised to see<BR>Four and twenty maidenheads a-hangin from the tree...<BR><BR>There were dancin' in the meadow, there was dancin in the ricks<BR>An ye couldnae hear the bagpipes fer tha swishin o' tha pricks...<BR><BR>The bride was in the parlor, explainin to the groom,<BR>"The vagina, not the rectum is the entrance to the womb..."<BR><BR>The Queen was in the parlor, eating bread an honey,<BR>The King was in the parlormaid and she was in the money...<BR><BR>The parson's daughter, she was there a sittin way down front<BR>A wreath of roses in her hair, and a carrot in her cunt...<BR><BR>And the parson's wife, she was there, her arse against the wall,<BR>Shoutin to the laddie boys, " I'll take ye one and all"...<BR><BR>It's the first lady forward, and the second lady back,<BR>And the third lady's finger in the second lady's crack...<BR><BR>The village butcher, he was there, a cleaver in his hand.<BR>And everytime he turned around, he circumcised the band...<BR><BR>Now, all the ladies back, with your arses against the wall,<BR>If ye cannae get fucked at Kerriemur, ye cannae get fucked at all!...<BR><BR>The village priest, oh, he was there and on the floor he sat,<BR>Amusin himself by abusin himself and catchin it in his hat...<BR><BR>They was doin' in the kitchen, and doin' it on the stones.<BR>Ya couldna' hear the music for the wheezin' and the groans...<BR><BR>The undertaker, he went there dressed in a long black shroud,<BR>Swingin from the chandelier and pissin on the crowd...<BR><BR>The mayor's daughter she was there, and kept the crowd in fits,<BR>By jumpin off the mantle piece and landin on her tits...<BR><BR>Singin--- Who hae ye lassie, Who hae ye noo?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tha mon wha hae ye last nicht, He cannae hae ye noo.<BR><BR>There was screwin on the banister, an screwin on the stairs<BR>You couldnae see the carpet for the mess of curly hairs...<BR><BR>The village idiot, he was there, he was a perfect fool<BR>He sat beneath the old oak tree and whittled off his tool...<BR><BR>The village whore now she was there, a layin' on the floor<BR>And every time she opened her legs the suction closed the door...<BR><BR>The village baker he was there, so drunk he began to scream<BR>He grabbed the girls like great big tarts and pumped them full of cream...<BR><BR>The village potter he was there he made a dong of clay<BR>He sat little girls upon the wheel and gave them all a lay...<BR><BR>The village rabbi he was there, treatin' a knife like a toy<BR>He swung and swished and he took an inch off every man and boy...<BR><BR>The village acrobat he was there, a' screwin' on the stair<BR>The bannister broke, he doubled his stroke and finished her off in midair...<BR><BR>The village hunter he was there, polishin' his gun with skill<BR>Four girls were all barin' their asses, waitin' for the kill...<BR><BR>The village fool now he was there, he had an amazin' lack of wits<BR>For every time a girl would pass, he'd just drool on her tits...<BR><BR>The village virgin she was there, the poor girl got a scare<BR>But from under her dress she heard a voice "It's only my tongue up there!"...<BR><BR>The village swordsman he was there, he had a rod like a train<BR>And when he rammed an ass they cried, "My god he impaled my brain"...<BR><BR>The village constable he was there, a-twirlin' his billy stick<BR>Surprised were all the girls to find it was really a twelve inch prick...<BR><BR>The village maiden now she was there, a clingin' to her dress<BR>Bein' chased by a hoard of horny priests, her sins they would confess...<BR><BR>The village nun she was there, great stains upon her habit<BR>That was because she spent the night screwin' like a rabbit...<BR><BR>The village postman, he was there, the puir min had tha pox,<BR>He could nae fuck the lassies, so he fucked the letter box...<BR><BR>The chimney sweep, yes he was there, but soon he got the boot,<BR>For every time he farted, he filled the room with soot...<BR><BR>The groom was now excited, and racing through the halls,<BR>Pullin on his pecker and a-showin off his balls...<BR><BR>Big John, the farmer, swore an oath, then cursed an spat,<BR>For his forty acre corn field was completely fuckin flat...<BR><BR>And when the Ball was over, this opinion was expressed:<BR>Although they liked the music, the screwin was the best...<BR><BR>Singin--- Who hae ye lassie, Who hae ye noo?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tha mon wha hae ye last nicht, He cannae hae ye noo.<BR><A HREF="#top">Top of Page</A>   <BR><BR><STRONG> <H2><A NAME="bill">Barnacle Bill</A></H2></STRONG>
