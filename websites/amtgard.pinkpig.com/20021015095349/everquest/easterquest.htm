No, we're not talking brightly-coloured poultry products.  We're talking tidbits of humour that the programmers have hidden for their own egos or for our amusement.  EverQuest, like many other popular computer programs, has it's share of Easter Eggs, and this site is an attempt to document many of them.  <font size=-2> (Last Updated January 6, 2002)</font><p><B>WARNING!

Drop me a line!  <A HREF="mailto:snicker@pinkpig.com?subject=Easter Egg">Talies the Wanderer</A>.  What is an Easter Egg?  Well, it's not pictures of coordinates on walls or obvious visual bugs (like the recent spate of mip-mapping errors), or accidental mob-poses.  These are not Easter Eggs (even if they are hilarious; I have a separate section for those).  Neither is it random anagrams (yeah yeah, we know what Rucksif is an anagram of).  Easter Eggs are pieces of code, artwork or other content <B>deliberately</B> "hidden" within the game, that (usually) has some sort of pop-culture significance, or other importance to the programmer(s).  As you read through the site, it should be very obvious what will really qualify...<p><br>New eggs are marked with <IMG SRC="eeggnew.gif" HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALT="NEW!!!">.<br>Updates are marked with <IMG SRC="updated.gif" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=46 ALT="Updated!">.<!--<p><IMG SRC="eeggnew.gif" HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALT="NEW!!!"> <br>  <FONT size=-2> </font><p>--><hr><p><CENTER><h2>People</H2></CENTER>Everquest is populated with hundreds of non-player characters (or NPCs).

(For those who don't know the story, Vyrinnia started as a female, then became male later in life.  Bob Painter does not suffer (or enjoy) the same treatment - but was one hell of a GM to work under.)<br>  <FONT size=-2>Thanks to Mr.Crystalblaze of Tarew Marr</font><p><p><IMG SRC="eeggnew.gif" HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALT="NEW!!!"> Luclin has had it's share of tributes, too.

Now, he has recently been seen in the Qeynos Aqueducts, where he is a placeholder for a quest.  His name is a reference to William Barclay "Bat" Masterson, the American frontier lawman known for his good looks and ivory-handled pistols.  This Bait, however, seems only interested in fishing...<br><FONT size=-2><i>Some people have suggested a less-than-honourable reason for the name - claiming that he must have become a master at his chosen profession of baiting - however, I chose to ignore that one.  Of course the fact that he's followed by "Giz" Dinree...  oh nevermind.</i></font><br><FONT size=-2>Thanks to Fudce and Lysandria</font><p><p><IMG SRC="eegg2.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">In HighKeep, there once was a High-Elven princess being kept captive. She has since been moved to somewhere... else... Her name is Princess Lenya.  When she was still a resident, if you hailed her, she said "Aren't you a little short for a High Keep Guard?"  There is still a "Princess Lenia" in a jail cell downstairs - but she's a little different...<br>Anyway, her name (and her comment) referred to Princess Leia in Star Wars.<p><p><IMG SRC="eegg3.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Guards Regis and Philbin in the Qeynos Hills area. These both refer to Regis Philbin, popular TV gameshow host.<p><p><IMG SRC="eegg4.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">In South Karana, you'll find a Bard at the fountain named Vhalen which could be interpreted as an abbreviation for Van Halen, a rock and roll band.<br><font size=-2> Others have suggested "Valen" - a character from the popular Science Fiction television show "Babylon Five" - however, in light of his musical nature, I'm sticking with the first interpretation.  That, and his comments - see the next egg....</font><p><p><IMG SRC="eegg2.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Vhalen also has some interesting things to say about a bard named "Metala" - perhaps a rivalry between Van Halen and Metallica?<p><p><IMG SRC="eegg1.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Speaking of Metallica, check out the two Barbarians in West Karanas - Lars and Ulrich.  Lars Ulrich is the drummer for the Napster-hating band.<br><font size=-2>Thanks to John Herrington, Kortalh Rhufoniog and Robbie Bemrich</font><p><p><IMG SRC="eegg5.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">A bard merchant in Freeport is named Jekel Enheid - like "Dr. Jekell and Mr. Hyde", a novel by Robert Louis Stevenson.<p><p><IMG SRC="eegg6.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Cubert, the Gelatinous Cube underneath Qeynos, is a reference to a popular arcade game during the 80's: Q-Bert.<p><p><IMG SRC="eegg2.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Lake Rathetear has a Prince Kyrmt Keroppi - the frogluk.  Kin to Kermit the Frog, perhaps?  Plus, his title, Prince, suggests the Frog Prince of fairytale fame - feel like kissing a frog anyone?  Also, Keroppi is the name of one of Hello Kitty's friends, who just happens to be a frog.  A triple pun!  (thanks to far too many people to note here)<p><p><IMG SRC="eegg4.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Silly Bard names!  You've seen them everywhere - but where oh where is the oft-rumoured Fabian?  His real-life namesake was a popular singer in the Fifties and early Sixties.  But much like his namesake, he is nowhere to be seen now. * * * Update! * * * Fabian has been seen in Freeport now, so feel free to bop on by the Grub n Grog, to catch one of his infamous performances, but don't bother with his quest - it's not worth the trouble.<p><p><IMG SRC="eegg5.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">At the very bottom of Ak'anon, they have a scrapyard, and who should maintain that Scrapyard but one Sanfyrd Montop (his name has recently changed to Sanfyrd Featherhead for a Ranger quest, but Ak'anon quest messages still refer to the old name).  This is quite possibly an homage to that lovable cantankerous old coot, salvage-yard owner Fred Sanford, as seen on "Sanford and Son," a sitcom during the 70's.  Added trivia bonus: Fred Sanford was played by Redd Foxx, whose real name was John Elroy Sanford.<p><p><IMG SRC="eegg6.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">In Kedge Keep, two high-powered sharks go by the names of "Cauldronboil" and "Cauldronbubble" - reference's to Shakespeare's MacBeth.<p><p><IMG SRC="eegg1.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">In Kithicor Forest, three named tigers can be found by the names of Reggit, Eenot, and Hobbes(?) - apparently plays on three famous tigers: Tigger, Tony and Hobbes from Calvin and Hobbes.<br><font size=-2>Thanks to John Beckemeier</font><p><p><IMG SRC="eegg3.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">By the shore of the lake in the West Commonlands sits a lonely man skipping stones.  His name used to be Skippyn Stoneshear.  ("Skipping Stones Here").  Someone buy him a fishing pole, so he has something else to do.  *Update* His name is now Skippyn Stonesheart.  What a change.<p><p><IMG SRC="updated.gif" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=46 ALT="Updated!"><IMG SRC="eegg2.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">The Gnomes of Steamfont are no less free from punsters - just watch that dirty little backstabbing Feddi Dooger - which some have said is a reference to that horror-film villain, Freddy Krueger.  (I guess he's a real nightmare to the younguns.)  In the early days of EQ, Feddi didn't wander alone, either... he had two friends: Mydol Byers (Michael Myers - Halloween), and Nornan Dates (Norman Bates - Psycho).  Sounds like Steamfont was a horror-filled place to grow up!<br><font size=-2>Thanks to John Herrington, Kevin Miller, and Exok Grimstone of Saryn</font><p><p><IMG SRC="eegg1.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Also in Steamfont, you will find a lovely little clockwork spider named Charlotte - after the title spider in Charlotte's Web.<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Garon Galloway</font><p><p><IMG SRC="eegg4.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">In Dagnor's Cauldron, there are two rats by the names of Flotsam and Jetsam - methinks they escaped a sinking ship somewhere... (Flotsam refers to any wreckage left in the sea after a shipwreck, while jetsam is any cargo deliberately thrown overboard and washed ashore or sunk.)  Incidentally, these also happen to be the names of the two electric eels who harassed Ariel in Disney's "The Little Mermaid."<br>In another possible nod to Metallica (or perhaps just coincidence) Flotsam and Jetsam was also the name of a band - one of their former members (Jason Newsted) is now Metallica's bassist.<br>And another possibility, and the most intriguing to me, is the reference from JRR Tolkein's The Two Towers.  "Flotsam and Jetsam" is the name of the chapter in which Saruman's tower, Orthanc, was destroyed by the Ents, who diverted an entire river, submerging the tower.  Merry and Pippin took the names of Flotsam and Jetsam, from the idea of detritus washed up on the shore of the artificial lake.  Since Dagnor's Cauldron also covers submerged ruins, this reference certainly has a lot of relevance...<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Kelton Lightforge, Scott Salyers, Toreck Troublemaker, Mark Ellister, Eric Statlander, Dean Ross, Oldoak of the Seventh Hammer Server, and Darkalen Foolsbarrow</font><p><p><IMG SRC="eegg5.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Highkeep sports an unusually large number of strange names for guards.  Stop by and visit with Chopin and Bach (in the music room) Bolton (Michael's cousin?), Antilles (Wedge! I gotcher back!), and Duras (which some say is phonetic for "Guard Yer ass" - No, I don't think this was a reference to Klingons).  You can also visit the prison, where you may see Guards Handy and Chin (Chin guard, hand guard).<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Megtilia Drunkshadow, Scott Ervin and others</font><p><p><IMG SRC="eegg6.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">The desert of South Ro has some pretty dry humour, too - check out the Sand Giant "Hassan" - a reference to a classic Warner Brother's character... "Hasan....

His name is Nottap Ekim - which is Mike Patton, from Faith No More, spelled backwards.<br><font size=-2>Thanks to William A Stubbs</font><p><p><IMG SRC="eegg5.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, they say.  So, apparently, are bad puns.  Two of the Beholders in the Gorge of King Xorbb are named "Syrkl" and "Sviir" - or Circle and Sphere.  Also, Xorbb could be interpreted as "Orb" - another round joke...<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Bridget</font><p><p><IMG SRC="eegg3.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Here's one for the "truly obscure" category - In Qeynos, near the city gates, stands a man by the name of Tubal Weaver.  He is terribly greedy and overcharges horribly, and doesn't pay nearly enough for goods.  In Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, there is a similarly stingy and dishonest fellow, also by the name of Tubal...<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Maben Wolfbrother</font><p><p><IMG SRC="eegg2.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">There are two guards on the stone bridge in North Karana - the one on the West being named Oistyn, and the East being Westyn.  <br><font size=-2>Thanks to Scott Salyers</font><p><p><IMG SRC="eegg1.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Even the newly discovered outpost of Firiona Vie isn't safe from rampaging puns - the bankers there are known as Wella and Wellford Fargin.  Predecessors to the great Wells Fargo, perchance? <br><font size=-2>Thanks to Karisma Swiftarrow</font><p><p><IMG SRC="eegg3.gif" HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">In Innothule Swamp is an elf named Jars Legola.  This could be a reference to the elf Legolas from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. <br><font size=-2>Thanks to Matt Waggoner</font><p><p><IMG SRC="eegg5.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Qeynos was ready for newbies from day one.  Even the guards new that.  Ask Guard Wenbie (anagram of Newbie) and Guard Kwint (anagram of Twink).  Both guards are involved in very low-level quests.<br>  <FONT size=-2>Thanks to William J. Michalski and Gregory Gadow</font><p><p><IMG SRC="eegg4.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Also in Neriak, in the Bar known as the Maiden's Fancy, you will find two characters: Belyea and Cecile Kjartan.  I have it on good authority that these refer to one of the original GMs, Stephen Belyea and his wife, Cecile.  Kjartan was Stephen's alias on many muds.  Now that's immortality!<br>  <p><p><IMG SRC="eegg2.gif" HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALT="*">Another dose of immortality - Kevan MacPherson, of MacPherson's Meats in Halas, obviously refers to former programmer Kevin MacPherson.<br>  <FONT size=-2>Thanks to Greg Peterson!</font><p><p><IMG SRC="eegg1.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Spoolie Gee is a tailoring merchant in North Ro.

In Paineel, there is a Shadowknight named Azzar Habbib.  If he doesn't like you, he shouts, "Behold the power of the Dreadful Hat!" as he attacks.  If he does like you, he'll tell you that his hat was stolen by a giant bat, which is the beginning of the Dreadful Cap quest.<br>But that's not the weird part.  Azar Habib is a real person - an Arabic musician, made "famous" in the gaming world by a little flash video, featuring a song he performed, some bizarre pictures of a hat dancing from one person's head to another, and some very interesting subtitling... <A HREF="Hat Baby!">http://user.tninet.se/~prv247p/hatt/hatten.swf</A><br>The words you are reading are NOT any form of Middle Eastern, they are Swedish. Some wacky Swede (which doesn't narrow the list a whole lot) made up some Swedish lyrics that more or less sound like the Arabic lyrics. The Swedish version has phrases like "The hat is yours!" "Glue the Ham! Cool!" and "Let's dump the hat in Bert's coke-au-lait!"<br>Only the Swedes would put milk in their soda and then write a song about dunking a happy hat into it.

You can find all sorts of people there, including Dyne the Diligent (Pour Homme), Mixxy the Bitter (death was always in her wake), Vashaar the All Seeing (his eyes are at last shut), Binelen the Pathweaver (we are as lost children without her), Aradune the Green (his flaming sword was a beacon to all), Ssra (snuffer of worlds), and Xectia the Tardy (even unto the grave).<br>  <FONT size=-2>Thanks to Spuff Nuffendud and Seilat!</font><p><p><IMG SRC="eegg1.gif" HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALT="*">Douglas Adams (<u>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</u>) taught us that you should always have your towel - a lesson perhaps learned by Alrik Farsight, a Druid living in the Timorous Deep.  If you hail him, he says, "Too many towels. Oh well, someone told me they were good to have once."<br>  <FONT size=-2>Thanks to Sajar Bladtracker and Varne of Cazic Thule!</font><br><font size=-2><i>"A towel is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have."</i> - Ford Prefect, "The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy"</font><p><p><IMG SRC="updated.gif" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=46 ALT="Updated!"><IMG SRC="eegg2.gif" HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALT="*">True to it's name, the Plane of Mischief is full of fun.  No programmer could resist throwing in some hidden jokes for those few hardy adventurers able to make it all the way there.  The zone itself is full of a number of strangely named creatures - skunks called fish, plants called moldy sausage - and a bunch of strange rooms and areas.  But perhaps the most interesting things are some of the hidden mob jokes... For example, in one room, you find four human-sized sphinxes who want to dance for you.  Tell Ashley, Brittina, Diana and Roxxanne that you would like to see them dance, and they will jump up and do the Marinara (Hey!) for you. <A HREF="dance1.jpg">Picture!</A>.  If you ask them to teach you to dance, they encourage you to dance, then cast a Magi Curse on you!<br>In a nearby area, a giant hand named Pinky Ekkolofezznaboten II likes to hear knock knock jokes.  Well... not really.  If you say "Knock knock," he laughs and says "Here's a knock for you!", then casts a spell that throws you backwards.<A HREF="knocknock.jpg">Picture!</A>  I'd hate to see what he'd do if you told a lightbulb joke...<br>  <FONT size=-2>Thanks again to Loganta Tranng of Eci, Dimuyen Sylvanesty and the <A HREF="http://www.tritonguild.com/">Triton Guild on Povar</A>!</font><p><p><IMG SRC="eegg5.gif" HEIGHT=23 WIDTH=32 ALT="*">Who says Everquest isn't a "first-person shooter?"  It is if you have the EQ version of the "BFG9000" - <B>B</B>reezeboot's <B>F</B>rigid <B>G</B>nasher. This handy little tool, which bears a startling resemblance to a science fiction weapon, when activated, will knock the target backwards - reports have indicated anywhere from a hundred to several hundred feet!!!  And to complete the joke, when identified, the item is seen to be a "Model 9000"...  Must be some Quake fans in the programming department.<br>  <FONT size=-2>Thanks to Kelador Stormwolf!</font><p><!--***************************************************************************--><hr><CENTER><H2>Neat Stuff!</H2></CENTER><p>I get soooo many submissions, and frankly, many of them are just not Easter Eggs, but they are still so cool, that I'd hate to not have them be seen.  So here is a collection of things that aren't QUITE Easter Eggs, or not verifiable, but close. <p><IMG SRC="goldstar.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=33 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Here's a cute one.  Apparently, the 60's flashbacks hit Lake Rathe. [<A HREF="colouredspots.jpg">Picture</A>].  Oooh - look at all the pretty colours....<br>  <FONT size=-2>Thanks Co§mic Fool!</font><p><p><IMG SRC="goldstar.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=33 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Just a little something for the bored... Cast levitate in Unrest, and climb to the top of the house, then run to the outer wall - just on the outside of that wall is ANOTHER <A HREF="wall.jpg">wall</A>.  Make sure you have a way to gate out if you do go back here.<br>  <FONT size=-2>Thanks Keleborne of Bristlebane!</font><p><p><IMG SRC="goldstar.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=33 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Once upon a time, Fire Beatles roamed just outside of Freeport.  Sadly, they, like their namesakes, are no more.  Perhaps there will be a reunion tour? <br><font size=-2>Thanks to Drax</font><p><IMG SRC="goldstar.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=33 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">More anagram fun!  Drolvarg, as everyone has noticed, spells "Gravelord" backwards, without the "E".  Nektulos misspells "Skeleton."  Tpos Icepaw in Velketor's Labyrinth could be an anagram of "Spot".  Omat Vastsea, part of the Cleric Epic quest, could be an acronym for "Old Man And The Sea" - a book by Ernest Hemingway.  Remember books?  It's what we used to read before Everquest...<br>  <FONT size=-2>Thanks to Bibben Nofibben of Tarew Marr, Miriamele Presbyter, Deana Feldkamp, David Tinsley, Malakie Torsade of the Test Server and Niteen Onikisu of Mithaniel Marr</font><p><p><IMG SRC="goldstar.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=33 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Adryan pointed out that Feerrott could be seen as "Fear Route" - meaning that it is the entrance to The Plane of Fear. <br><font size=-2>Thanks to Adryan, Rogue of Erollisi Marr!</font><p><IMG SRC="goldstar.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=33 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">In North Karana, a giant wanders around by the name of Timber the Tiny.  Is this a reference to Tiny Tim, the very unusual musician made famous for his ukelele and falsetto performances?  I wonder if he "tiptoes through the tulips" in his sandals?  Of course, there is also a "Tiny Tim" in Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol," but I don't think that's the reference here.<p><IMG SRC="goldstar.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=33 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Garrison Keillor makes his appearance in Neriak, in the form of Guard G'Noir - which is possibly a play on "Guy Noir" - a character in his famous "Prairie Home Companion."<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Tszaaz E'Taurguin</font><p><IMG SRC="goldstar.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=33 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">In the back of the Lion's Mane Tavern in South Qeynos, there spawns a character by the name of Miles Gordy.  Could this be a reference to two famous engineers from Star Trek: The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine? (Geordy La Forge and Miles O'Brien).  Or is it possibly a tribute to the jazz bass player Gordy Mills? Only the  programmers know for sure...<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Michael Taylor and Vagen Deadshot</font><p><IMG SRC="goldstar.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=33 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">One of the most startling things in Everquest is when the mobs start talking...  I know I nearly jumped out of my skin the first time I heard a beggar say, "Might I have some coppers, please?"  Madmen in the desert also say this.  There are a few other things that speak, as well - spectres whisper "Diiiieeee", giants mutter in their own language...  There's even rumoured to be some vocal traps in Velious!<br><font size=-2>Thanks to Mortanious of Brell</font><p><IMG SRC="goldstar.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=33 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">I probably shouldn't even mention this one - but I'll let you draw your own conclusion.  In the Neriak Caster's Guild, there is a Wizard guildmaster by the name of Litz B'Doph.  Now THAT should have been caught by the name filters!<br>  <FONT size=-2>Thanks to Evan Rodwell and Kent Masterson Brown - two people with too much time on their hands</font><p><IMG SRC="goldstar.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=33 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">In Neriak, there's a store called the Silk Underground.  It's just possible that this is a reference to the Velvet Underground, an influential band in the sixties. <br><font size=-2>Thanks to J Branch</font><p><IMG SRC="goldstar.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=33 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">In another possible jazz reference, someone pointed out that "Budo" (a Leatherfoot Raider (Halfling guard) in the Misty Thicket, is also the name of a song on Miles Davis album - "Miles & Coltrane" (CBS 1955-1958). Do we have a jazz fan at Verant? <br>  <FONT size=-2>Thanks to Khya Ebonheart, Chris Foley and Eric!</font><p><IMG SRC="goldstar.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=33 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">This isn't really an easter egg - but it's such a cool picture, I couldn't think of a better place to put it.  In any case, this is a <A HREF="unfinishedkaladim.jpg">picture</A> of Kaladim, apparently in the early days, while they were still painting it... <br>Weeeelllll... Not really...  Actually, it's what happens when you use a video card that is well below the recommended rating for Everquest.<br>  <FONT size=-2>Thanks to Seilat</font><p><IMG SRC="goldstar.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=33 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="*">Ever get bored while waiting for the boat in the Overthere?
