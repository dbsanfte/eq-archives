<p align="Left">WELCOME to Jennafae's Everquest Screenshot Archives.  
The purpose of this project is to provide a resource of interesting and exceptional 
background and scenic screenshots for the vast community of Everquest fan artists.  Please note
that the purpose of this collection is NOT to represent every single zone in Everquest.  This 
gallery was inspired by my peers and friends at <a href="http://www.norrathsstudio.org">
Norrath's Studio</a>.  I am forever in debt to their undying support, creativity, inspiration, 
constructive criticism, and most of all their friendship on my journey as a screenshot artist.  
In gratitude, I dedicate this Gallery to the amazing talent that lives in the N.S. "Studio Regulars."

<font size="3" color="FFCC66">Rules for submitting images to the Archives:</font><br>

If you would like to contribute to the project, I am seeking screenshots of 
exceptional subject matter and quality.  Please email your unedited screenshots to 
<a href="mailto:JennaEQaddict@aol.com">JennaEQaddict@aol.com</a>. <b>All screenshots not meeting the following criteria 
will be disregarded.</b>  These perameters have been set in place to save time and work on my part.  For the most part, 
I think all of the regulars on Norrath's Studio know how many hours I have put into this project and understand the 
need for these guidelines.  For newcomers, I hope these rules will not deter you from contributing to the project.<br><br>

<ol>
<li>All images should be <b>no larger than 1024 x 768</b>. If you run EQ at a higher resolution, please resize them. 
Please do not alter the images in any other way.</li>

<li><b>Convert images to JPEG</b> and rename them appropriately by zone or something I can recognize.  Please save all 
files in the highest quality possible.</li>

<li>Create a copy of the image and resize to a <b>200 x 150 thumbnail</b>. Height is more important than width, 
always make them 150 pixels in height where slight size discrepencies occur. Save this file with the exact same file name, 
only add a 't' to the end of it. For example, image <b>pok357.jpg</b> should have a coordinating thumbnail called 
<b>pok357t.jpg</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(please, no more shots of PoK, thanks)  </li>

<li>Please use <b>WinZip</b> or WinRar to zip the files before attaching them to your email. If you have an excess number of 
shots, zip 10 files at a time, then zip all of your zips together &nbsp;(if that makes any sense). </li>

<li> Please write <b>"Screenshot Archives"</b> in the subject heading of your email and include your <b>NAME as you 
would like it to APPEAR</b> on the list of contributors. I continually have to reply and ask this question again, and
will not do so in the future. </li>

<li> Please maintain my standards of <b>exceptional and high quality screenshots</b>..... <u>i.e. no more shots of PoK, 
please</u>. I will use and discard screenshots at my own discretion.  </li>
 
<li> Although it is not requested or required, donations are greatly appreciated.  You will find a "Paypal Donate" button below.
Many thanks in advance for your support and generosity.  </li><br><br>
