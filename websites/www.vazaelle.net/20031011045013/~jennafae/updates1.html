09.23.03</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;...and the first day of Autumn brings the winds of change.  I am taking a 
sabbatical from EQ and from my art, I'm sorry to say that I don't know for how long.  For those of you
who already have a portrait request in que, I promise that I wont forget about you.  Thanks to all for
the patience and support I've been receiving from the EQ community for the past 2 years.  Don't worry,
you have not seen the last of Portraits by Jennafae.

New portraits, sigs, and magelos have been added to the gallery pages.  Regrettfully, I have
closed the requests page due to the overwhelming amount of comissions I have waiting to be completed, 
and in most cases even started!  Please check back frequently, I will begin accepting orders again
as soon as I have caught up with the flood.<br><br>

If you have already sent a request and I have not yet been in contact with you, please send me an email
and I'll get back to you ASAP!

BIG update, this weekend.  I have the entire Portraits gallery up, with new images to boot.
I've also updated the Magelo gallery, and added two new sig pages to the Sigs gallery.  Check
out the Current Favorite links for my newest works.

Wow...okay I know I have not been able to do a lot of updating since the debut of Inky Mouse.
I have been working very hard on revamping the Screenshot Archives and am happy to say that the
facelift for that aspect of my site is complete.  I have also been enjoying some liesurely art
exchanges with fellow artists, and learning to use my new toy... a Wacom Intuoso2 Graphical Tablet!<br><br>

On top of all that, I have a new job.  BOO for real life!  Quick, someone go donate 100 grand or so
to my Paypal accout so I can quit my job and be Inky Mouse full time!<br><br>

I have completed a few new sigs and will be updating the galleries with those images very soon, along
with a few other portrait projects that are in the works.  You will find that the Requests page is up 
and running, as well.  More updatest to come!

As you can see, I have figured out how to use Iframes!  WOOT!  These lovely scrolling
window thingys here are the result.  Go me!<br><br>

As of now, only a skeleton of the site is operational.  You will find that
the Signature and Magelo galleries are ready for viewing, although the
Magelo thumbnails do not yet link to the larger images.  The Links page
is also up and running, so please check out a few of my favorite artist's
websites.</p>
