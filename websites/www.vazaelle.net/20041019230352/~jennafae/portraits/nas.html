A fun challenge to create.  Nasreen wanted her picture to be dark and evil, but not have the same generic 
elements that you see in just about every Necro sig out there....... skeletons, spectres, Crypt of Decay backgrounds, etc.
She wanted her Erudite hood removed and hand-painted black hair with red highlights.  The lower half of her 
body is completely repainted.  The background is comprised of shots from Plane of Earth, Plane of Fire, and Plane of Nightmare.  <br><br>

This was the VERY FIRST portrait done with the help of my favorite toy.... a Wacom Intuoso2 6x8 Graphical Tablet!!!
It proved to be an incredibly useful tool for painting hair.
