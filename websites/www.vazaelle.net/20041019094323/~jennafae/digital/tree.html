			May 2004<br>
			Inspired by some of work by artist <a href="http://www.jeshannon.com/">J.E.Shannon</a>, 
			this was a stepping stone in freehand digital painting for me.  I started with a blank 
			green canvas and had a blast letting this twisted tree grow.  You can also view some of 
			my work in progress <a href="http://www.norrathsstudio.org/phpBB4ns/viewtopic.php?t=14043">here.</a>
