Pandora redyed her armor just before my photo session with her, and her new colors became the basis for
this portrait.  She was not interested in the usual green color palette with a forest background that you
see in most ranger pics, so I chose Firiona Vie at sunset.  She also didn't want her pictures to be too 
"girly" so I kept the repaint on her hair very simple, as well as keeping the spell effects not-too-flashy.
I also repainted her armor so that more of her mid-section showed, making her a very sexy ranger!
