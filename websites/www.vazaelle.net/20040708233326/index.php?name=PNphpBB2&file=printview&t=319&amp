  Well KGM.. It does not seem that we have any really active wizards in the guild... As many of you nkow Tortholier is my main and as such, I usually concentrate most of my time to him, however, there are a few rangers progressing through our ranks and I am sure some of them will be hitting 65 very soon so I am thinking I am going to place Tor on the reserve list for a little while while I take care of another character of mine... Waystrik.  As such, anyone out there who has any need for a 37 wizard, or would like to play an alt around that lvl to get some xp, Im all for it.  Just send me a tell.     <hr />
