		In ages past, the Iksar were a slave race, once used as labor and food by the vile snake<br />
		race known as the Shissar. The Shissar were an old and very powerful race that practiced ancient and<br />
		evil magics and dared them selves to challenge the power of the gods. The gods retaliated against<br />
		these creatures by descending upon there homeland of Chelsith and unleashing a terrible green mist<br />
		that literally dissolved the flesh from the bones of the Shissar yet left all else untouched. Thus,<br />
		with the coming of the green mist did end the reign of the Shissar and thus began the age of the Iksar.<br />
</P><br />
<P ALIGN="justify"><br />
		So then it was that the Iksar do owe there freedom as a race to the mysterious Green Mists<br />
		sent from the gods, and thus it was tasting this newfound freedom did the Iksar become determined that<br />
		never again shall they become slaves to another power. To this end did Venril Sathir of the Kunzar tribe<br />
		unite all the tribes of the Iksar under his rule. To this end did his progeny conquer the face of Kunark<br />
		to rule a mighty empire that knew few boundaries. So determined were the Iksar to remain free that they<br />
		would conquer and rule any that could possibly stand against them. So then did come the Dragons. So then<br />
		did come the Ring of Scale and their war to wipe out the Iksar Empire.<br />
</P><br />
<P ALIGN="justify"><br />
		The war against the Dragons and their slave races raged on for near half a centenary. Both<br />
		sides suffered untold losses and, in the end, no true winner could be seen. The dragons were forced to<br />
		retreat finally, but not before launching one final deadly assault upon the great capital of the Iksar.<br />
		Their Empire now in ruins, those races, which had once been conquered by the Iksar, did revolt and again<br />
		became a new threat. So now do we come unto the present.<br />
</P><br />
<P ALIGN="justify"><br />
		The Iksar have gathered in their new capital city of Cabilis (New Sebilis to some) and they<br />
		plot and plan to regain former glories.  Some of the Iksar leaders feel their destiny lay in again<br />
		conquering the continent they once ruled. Others feel the destiny of the Iksar lay in the far away lands<br />
		of the softskins whom they see as having invaded their homeland in recent years. A few however remember<br />
		the lessons of the past. A few still recall the ancient enemy that has decimated their empire, a few<br />
		still know the one and only true enemy to the freedom of the Iksar is the deadliest creature to ever<br />
		walk the face of all Norrath, the Dragons.<br />
</P><br />
<P ALIGN="justify"><br />
		So it is that was born a special group of Iksar, bent on the freedom of their race. No<br />
		longer closed-minded about the enemies of their people, these Knights remember that it was a Devine<br />
		Act that gave them their freedom, and they look back to the time of the Green Mists for inspiration<br />
		in the days ahead. And so did they form the<br />
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="4"><I><B>Knights of the Green Mist</B></I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="4">,<br />
		drawing not only from the ranks of all the factions of Iksar, but also enlisting the aid of the<br />
		softskins of like mind. The Knights operate outside of the boundaries of the rulers of Cabilis. They<br />
		have one, and only one, true goal: <I>&quot;The ultimate destruction of the greatest threat ever known to<br />
		all of Norrath,&quot;</I> ~ the Dragon menace. To this end, have they sought out many of the soft-skinned<br />
		races and found those that, too, realize the threat that Dragon-kind poses to all races and joined<br />
		together to exterminate this threat.<br />
</P><br />
<P ALIGN="justify"><br />
		So do the Knights now recruit those brave enough to aid them in their stand against this<br />
		new menace, not as simply Iksar or Elf or Human or Troll, but rather as free beings that shall not<br />
		see there races fall under the threat of the Ring of Scale. So now shall they seek out those who<br />
		will join in their crusade. So then shall their ranks swell, and so then shall no clawed beast still<br />
		walk upon the ground of Norrath.<br />
