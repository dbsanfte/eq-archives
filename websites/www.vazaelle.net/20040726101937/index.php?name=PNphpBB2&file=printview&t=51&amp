  Heya just wanted to say I'm gonna force myself into a hiatus. I've been playing too much recently and mostly I've been just sitting around doing nothing when I log on to EQ. I'd rather be doing something more valuable than sitting on EQ waiting for something to happen. I'll attempt to stay off for as long as I can so hopefully when I come back I'll have the urge to actually acomplish something online, and if Raksha agress to flash me a bunch of times maybe I'll come back sooner. <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> Anyways have fun nato and don't you all miss me too much.
<br />
