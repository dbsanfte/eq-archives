  It has been sometime since i have posted here, but I must announce the disbanding of the Rebels of Vazaelle. I haven't played in many months, or had the ambition to. Many members have found or are looking for other guilds, and i have lost interest in playing. So, im disbanding the guild and cancelling my account.  No sense in paying for something I'm not even using.. 
<br />

<br />
my website and message board will remain open for the time being, but at some point i will take those down as well     <hr />

  What's wrong Mwdan?!  Married life keeping you occupied?  I will post an open invitation over on your boards to give a temporary or permanent home to those left without one.  I hate to see you go, you have been a good friend.  RL has has also been after me all hot and sweaty too, so I haven't been playing much either.  Wish you guys could find a way to keep it together over there though.  GL friend.     <hr />

  Mwdan,
<br />

<br />
I am saddened to see you go, but understand your situation. I wish you only happiness in this thing you call "RL" I hate to see a good ally fade away, but even moreso a good friend.
<br />
You will be missed and remembered.
<br />
