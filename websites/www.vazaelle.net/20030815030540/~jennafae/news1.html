Welcome to InkyMouse.com, formerly known as "Portraits by Jennafae."
The new interface of my website is up and running, however you will still
find the old interface intact until the construction is completed.</p>

<p align="left">
Many thanks to Lyssara of Norrath's Studios for bringing vision of my
"inky mouse" to life by creating the mouse that resides in my new logo.<br>
Thank you Lyssara!</p>

Stay tuned for more changes!</p>
