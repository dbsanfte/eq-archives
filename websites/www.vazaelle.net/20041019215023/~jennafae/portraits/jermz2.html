Jermz was begging for a new portrait and sig... this was the result.  My first try at painting a cloak, it was
a lot of fun!  I think this is an EQ2 background.  The original shot had a large ornate wooden door on the left
side that I didn't care for.  I sliced the screenshot in half and did mirrored the right half, then slapped Jermz
in the middle to cover up a nasty seam
