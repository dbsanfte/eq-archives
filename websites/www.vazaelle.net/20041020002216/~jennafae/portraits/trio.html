This portrait was a long time coming.  Kad, Nelio, and I have been best friends in game and were practically
inseperable for close to three years.  Through multiple times quitting EQ, starting again, leaving and joining guilds, 
and even through a server transfer ...  There is not anything we would not do for one another, not anywhere
we would not go.  Friends like this are few and far in between, I am truly blessed to have these guys in my
life.  I wanted this portrait to portray the simple and undying bond that we three share.
