UPDATES!<br><br>
<p align="left">
<b><font color="6666CC">
2.03.04</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have finally completed updating the Gift Gallery.  That's all I have for you today,
my muse has left me and I'm waiting for her to COME BACK!

<p align="left">
<b><font color="6666CC">
2.01.04</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of you will be THRILLED to find out that Rob and I started playing Everquest again
this week.  I'm a little ashamed of myself for breaking my vow to never play again.  I guess they call it EverCrack for
a reason.  

<p align="left">
<b><font color="6666CC">
1.30.04</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah yeah yeah, I've not put up a page with the Art Duel pieces yet.  I'll get to it soon!
I HAVE, however updated my cartoon art page with a couple of new pics.  I'm currently working on my NS Secret Crush Valentine's
exchange piece, which I'm nearly finished with!  I'm also working on a web design project for a friend.  More updates to come!


<p align="left">
<b><font color="6666CC">
1.7.04</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Updated my Links section.  I'm in the midst of an Art Duel with Tethax of N.S.  Check
back soon for the results of the war!

<p align="left">
<b><font color="6666CC">
1.1.04</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;HAPPY NEW YEAR!  My first update of 2004 ... and I don't have anything for you to look at, LOL.
I will soon, however.  I've caught the Blinkie Bug and have downloaded a trial verson of Jasc Animation Shop.  You can view
some of the blinkies I've made already for Norrath's Studio <a href="http://www.raenestorm.org/phpBB4ns/viewtopic.php?t=10569" target="new">
here.</a>

12.28.03</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Revamped my gallery page and FINALLY got the Gift Gallery up.

<p align="left">
<b><font color="6666CC">
12.15.03</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well I'VE been busy, how bout you?  I'm working a TON right now, retail stinks during the holiday season.  However, I've somehow
managed to find time for some art.  Please check out my new links to the right to see my holiday toons.

<p align="left">
<b><font color="6666CC">
11.04.03</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  A very long overdue update!  Life has been crazy and upside down for me lately, I apologize
for the length of time that has past since my last major update!  I just finished a big move to another state.  I've been
without internet access for TWO WEEKS!  The HORROR!  As it is, I'm still without fast access cable internet and I'm having to
contend with dialup for now.  Moving is EXPENSIVE and cable isn't in the budget just yet.<br><br>

SO, it will still be a couple of weeks I think before I'm back online on a regular basis.  I'm still not taking on any
screenshot sig work, but I have found a bit of time for some much-needed art therapy!  Out of the closet I come, to show
that I have some talent to draw something original!  I'm very proud to present my first completely original drawings done 
since high school.  Please visit my featured favorite links for a closer peek at my new work.<br><br>

I've always been a fan of anime and manga-style artwork, but am only now venturing to try my hand at it.
Hopefully you will be seeing more of this type of toon work from me in the future!  I can't say when my next update will be, but hopefully SOON, so stay tuned!<br>
<br>

On a more personal note, I would like to send my love and thanks to all of my friends who have been so supportive during some 
rough times in my life.  I cannot imagine where I would be without you.

10.21.03</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Happy Birthday to me!  I just thought I'd be vain and wish myself a Happy 25th Birthday!

09.23.03</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;...and the first day of Autumn brings the winds of change.  I am taking a 
sabbatical from EQ and from my art, I'm sorry to say that I don't know for how long.  For those of you
who already have a portrait request in que, I promise that I wont forget about you.  Thanks to all for
the patience and support I've been receiving from the EQ community for the past 2 years.  Don't worry,
you have not seen the last of Portraits by Jennafae.

<b><font color="6666CC">
09.15.03</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
New portraits, sigs, and magelos have been added to the gallery pages.  Regrettfully, I have
closed the requests page due to the overwhelming amount of comissions I have waiting to be completed, 
and in most cases even started!  Please check back frequently, I will begin accepting orders again
as soon as I have caught up with the flood.<br><br>

If you have already sent a request and I have not yet been in contact with you, please send me an email
and I'll get back to you ASAP!

BIG update, this weekend.  I have the entire Portraits gallery up, with new images to boot.
I've also updated the Magelo gallery, and added two new sig pages to the Sigs gallery.  Check
out the Current Favorite links for my newest works.

Wow...okay I know I have not been able to do a lot of updating since the debut of Inky Mouse.
I have been working very hard on revamping the Screenshot Archives and am happy to say that the
facelift for that aspect of my site is complete.  I have also been enjoying some liesurely art
exchanges with fellow artists, and learning to use my new toy... a Wacom Intuoso2 Graphical Tablet!<br><br>

On top of all that, I have a new job.  BOO for real life!  Quick, someone go donate 100 grand or so
to my Paypal accout so I can quit my job and be Inky Mouse full time!<br><br>

I have completed a few new sigs and will be updating the galleries with those images very soon, along
with a few other portrait projects that are in the works.  You will find that the Requests page is up 
and running, as well.  More updatest to come!

<p align="left">
<b><font color="6666CC">
08.09.03</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
As you can see, I have figured out how to use Iframes!  WOOT!  These lovely scrolling
window thingys here are the result.  Go me!<br><br>

As of now, only a skeleton of the site is operational.  You will find that
the Signature and Magelo galleries are ready for viewing, although the
Magelo thumbnails do not yet link to the larger images.  The Links page
is also up and running, so please check out a few of my favorite artist's
websites.</p>
