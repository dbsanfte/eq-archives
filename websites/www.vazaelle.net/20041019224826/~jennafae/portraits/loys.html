This pic was a HUGE challenge due to the monk flying-kick pose.  Loys had to perform Intimidation for about 45 
minutes strait in game while I tried to get some good screenshots.  He was so patient about it, but I was starting to
get pissy.  I finally called an end to the torture and dealt with what I had.  The final produt that you see is 
actually composed of 3 or 4 different screenshots painstakingly pieced together.  I had to reconstruct and in some places
entirely repaint his arms, legs, hands and tunic.  I swore after this picture that I would never again do a monk's
flying kick...so don't ask!
