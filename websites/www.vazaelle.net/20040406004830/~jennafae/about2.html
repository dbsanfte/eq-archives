<p align="left">Welcome!<br><br>
My name is Erin, I am the face behind InkyMouse.com.    <br><br>

My ventures in digital art began when I created a "screenshot" portrait of my Everquest character, Jennafae. 
I then began creating artwork for friends and guild members, and finally started accepting commissions for custom portraits.
Although I don't play Everquest as much as I used to, I still use my experience as a screenshot artist as a spring board in all my current artistic
endeavors.<br><br>

I discovered the EQ fanart community of Norrath's Studios more than two years ago, where I am now an Administrator.  N.S. has helped my 
interests and talents in digital art, graphical design, and web design to grow by leaps and bounds.  I self-taught myself the HTML
web design language and built 5 of my own websites, as well as contributing graphics to several others.  I have also self-taught 
myself the basics of graphic design.  I generally use Adobe Photoshop 7.0, along with my Wacom Intuoso2 graphical tablet.<br><br>

I created <b>"Inky Mouse"</b> to be the new 
face of my art as a whole, which is branching out in new directions every day.  With the closing of my former website 
"Portraits by Jennafae" and the opening of "Inky Mouse" comes the birth of a journey that will hopefully lead me towards 
design school sometime in the future.  As soon as I work up the guts and the cash, I plan to take classes in web design 
and computer graphic design.<br><br>

Things I have done that have nothing to do with art ... <br>
I went to college for less than one semester as an English major, then
dropped out to start school at a techincal college.  I graduated from American Trans Air Aviation Training Academy two years later
with an Associates degree in Aviation Maintenance Technology.  I then said to hell with aviation and got married instead!  I've had
various retail jobs since then, and currently I work for Barnes & Noble where I'm moderately happy.<br><br>


Many thanks to Xorrin Aarikis for continuing to host my corner of the web on the best server in EverQuest, 
<a href="http://www.vazaelle.net">Vazaelle.net</a>.  If you would like to continue reading below, I have started 
keeping a virtual scrapbook of things in art and life that influence my work.<br><br>

<u><b>Colors I am drawn to</b></u> ... warm, rich, and earthy tones. Black, brown, red, rust, orange, gold, olive green. I also love how 
the world looks when it's raining, when everything becomes damp and muted, softer with cool overcast colors, gray, slate blue.<br><br>

<u><b>Art and Architecture styles I enjoy</b></u> ...<br>
Frank Lloyd Wright art & architecture <br>
Ameican Bungalow / Arts & Crafts architecture <br>
Celtic art, architecture, symbolism <br>
Asian style art ... earthy, clean, pure <br>
Art Nouveau (such as Alphonse Mucha) <br>
Indian & Moroccan architecture ... warm and rich <br>
Vintage advertising art <br><br>

<u><b>Quotes that I love: </b></u>
(although I am not an avid fan of Dali, I enjoy his philosophy on art and life)<br>
<i>"You have to systematically create confusion, it sets creativity free. Everything that is contradictory creates life."</i><br>
~Salvador Dali<br>

<i>"Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing." </i><br>
~Salvador Dali<br>

<i>"Great art is the outward expression of an inner life in the artist."</i><br>
~Edward Hopper<br>

<i>"How important are the visual arts in our society? I feel strongly that the visual arts are of vast and incalculable importance. Of course I could be prejudiced. I am a visual art."</i><br>
~Kermit the Frog<br><br>

<u><b>Miscellaneous pastimes</b></u> ...<br>
I love to wear pajamas and I collect striped socks.  I'm a very good cook but I hate to do the dishes.  I like Ginger Ale and cheese,
fruit, seafood, and pasta.  I never cook anything that doesn't have onions and garlic in it ... well, except desserts and stuff, but I don't
really like sweets.  I believe in faeries and monsters under the bed.  I think a house is not a home without a fat cat or two.  I like the smell
of mulled cider and dryer lint ... but not together.  I'm allergic to metal jewelry and the silent treatment.  I once painted an entire room orange.
