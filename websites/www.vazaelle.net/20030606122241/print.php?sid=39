<font class="print-normal">Sorry about the loooong delay in getting everything back online.  The site really was done within 2 hours of putting up that temporary &quot;maintenance&quot; page.  The problem came when my computer died.  Power supply, motherboard, even the case!  As a result, I lost all data on BOTH my hard drives...  I just got the system somewhat up and running today, although it's still randomly crashing and rebooting itself for no aparent reason..../rude Micro$oft.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the site is here.  I have the Calendar block, as well as the Gallery (for some reason that one did not port over.  I am going to try a different calendar - CalZone was nice, but I think the administration and customization of this new one will be nicer.<br />
<br />
Finally, the message boards are up and running.  The problem with them lies in that version 2 uses a totally different database than the old version 1.4beta that we were using before.  Everything works now that did not before, but the old forums and messages are still in the old database, waiting for me to figure out how to port them over.  The table structures are completely different, also, so a simple (? over 5,000 messages!) cut &amp; paste is out of the question.  There should be a converter/import script out there somewhere - I just haven't found it yet. ;)<br />
<br />
Oh, one other thing on the forums...  The first time you visit them, you will be &quot;registered&quot; in them.  I hacked the core of the user script on the site to do this automatically, so all your information will be the same.  The only thing you might have to do is re-type your auto-signature file, which is now done from your Preferences in the forum itself, not the My Account link to the main site.<br />
<br />
Once that is done, please send me a private message on the site and let me know which guild you are in and what your rank in that guild is.  I hope to have this step automated for new members in the near future, but for now, I'll just do it manually.  This is important, because the forums security features are now working, as promised!<br />
<br />
That's about it for now.  Still lots of work to be done.  Since I still can't seem to get into EQ for more than 5 or 10 minutes at a time without crashing, I'll focus on the site for a while.  Please shoot me your bug reports, suggestions, etc, also.  Thanks!<br />
