  Just gotta catch me before I hit a group.  lol...  Normally the first hour when I log in I'm free.  Once I hit a group, though, it's pretty hard for me to get out of where we're at to do an invite and then manage my way back solo.  If worse comes to worse, I can log an alot in to invite you.
<br />

<br />
As for helping with XP...I can buff ya up anytime I'm available.  I've also got a couple alts, but rarely play them.  Currently, my main alt is level 19 in LoIO soloing Sarnak.     <hr />
