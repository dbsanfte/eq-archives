Paven wanted his portrait to be very Paladin-like.  I chose to go with a "Holy White Knight" theme.... except he's not white!
His armor was black and orange to start with, I recolored it with permission, which inspired him to actually change his 
colors in-game also.  The borders are created from a celtic border font, the cross was hand painted while looking at a piece
of clipart as reference.  The horse's tail and mane are hand paitned, as well as the reigns (why EQ horses have a bridle but no
reigns I will never understand).
