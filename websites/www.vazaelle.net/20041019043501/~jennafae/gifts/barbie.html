HAHA, this is so cool!  Jennafae the Action Figure!  The Secret Elf who has been making these Barbie-like dolls
has been working EXTREMELY hard creating one for every NS Supporter .... more than 60 of them!  At the time that
I'm creating this page, she's nearly done with them.  Here is a peek at a few others she's done so far:<br><br>

The base for Jenna, Fransisca, and Oyye Vey is by <a href="http://www.spread-ur-wings.fr.st/">
Spread Your Wings</a>.  The base for Zoisite's doll is by <a href="http://www.geocities.com/nefertitidotcom/">
Nefertiti's</a>.  There were of course other dolls with other bases, but as I don't show them all here, I don't have to give credit!
