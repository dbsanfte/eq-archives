  Well Boys and girls, I have finally done it.  I have fallen helplessly in love with a young druid named Mechell.  A proposal was made early this afternoon, and I am happy to announce that you are all invited to an engagement party.  Friday November 15th in Misty Thicket, the party begins with many prizes and delectables and lets not forget alcoholic beverages.  Please everyone attend and share our joy at 6pm EST.  I know of one maybe two other wedding announcements that have been made so there will be plenty of happy people to hang out with, old friends and bitter enemies will all have fun.  Can't stand the company I'll summon you a beer or dozen.
<br />

<br />
Love is an endless desire to be endlessly desired.
<br />

<br />
