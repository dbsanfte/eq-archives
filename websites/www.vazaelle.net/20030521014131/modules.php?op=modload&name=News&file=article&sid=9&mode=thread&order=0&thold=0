Many have scorned me as just another treasure-happy adventurer, killing everything in site for a meager copper or cloth cap.  Mostly, I ignore such ignorant insults and keep to my own business.  My mission is far more complex than that of the average traveler.  I am in search of knowledge and balance.  Born and raised a Ranger of the Half-Elves, I find myself curious of new challenges as well as new knowledge.  I have keen insight into the workings of our world, and find that all is often not as it may first seem to the casual observer.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	Recently, on a trip to the Oasis of Marr, I encountered a rather odd individual who claims he hails from New Sebilis, the Iksar capital city of Kunark (perhaps more commonly known to Antonicans as Cabilis).  He was an Iksar, in all his scaly glory, but like none I have ever seen.  He was a young Mystic (apparent by his traditional and ceremonial Iksar attire – although I did notice he wore a small crest, the likes of which I have never seen before, and was obviously not of traditional Iksar design) of only about 14 or 15 seasons who called himself Vorrin.  What struck me as being so odd about him, though, was not the fact that he was in the Oasis – without escort, but that he was freely healing and aiding those in need – without being asked for his aid to begin with!  Certainly not like any Iksar I have ever encountered.  We softskins, as he refers to us, often see (and expect to see) a savage evil race of carnivorous lizard-beasts, not unlike those found in the swamps of Feerrott.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	I, not surprisingly, found myself unable to resist the temptation to engage this odd individual in conversation.  And converse he did!  He was all too happy to entertain my millions of questions, however, the more we got to know one another, the less unusual this now seemed.  In fact, what once seemed to be the “typical” Iksar now appears to be the “exception” within their kind.  It would appear, from what I have learned, that all we have been taught from childhood is not all there is to these increasingly complex creatures, not unlike our own kind.  And, we were also both pleasantly surprised and impressed at how well my personal attempts over the years to master the Lizard tongue have paid off, despite one or two embarrassing ‘missspronunsssiationsss’.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	After many hours of deeply intellectual, and often spiritual, conversation with the young Mystic, we found ourselves growing weary, and decided to rest and reflect upon all we have learned of each other.  We set to camp, and in the morning we hunted together for breakfast.  It would seem that their appetite, although a bit odd in preparation (or lack of), is not really all that different from our own – save the grubs and insects.  After a few more hours of conversation, we found ourselves parting ways, he returning to Kunark, and I continuing to Freeport to replenish supplies.  We did not part, however, without first agreeing to continue our conversation in a month’s time in his homelands of Kunark.  We decided that the best place to meet would be the Dreadlands, and he would show me how to circumvent the Iksar Guards, many of whom are still suspicious of…softskins.  I took advantage of the time I had to study up on the Iksar and the lands of Kunark, seeking the wisdom of Antonica and Faydwer’s most esteemed Sages.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	A month has passed since my last encounter with the Scaled Mystic named Vorrin.  As I make my way to our agreed meeting place in the Dreadlands, I begin to wonder if he would remember our conversation and show up or not.  Iksar are not generally known for their patience or long-term memory for agreements.  But deep down inside, I somehow know that he would be there.  I am reminded that this was no typical Iksar…or perhaps he is, but what we perceive as a “typical” Iksar, is not so typical, after all.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	As I wait for the boat on Ogre Isle in Timorous Deep, the rain begins to fall.  Lightly at first, but soon the winds pick up and the rain responds by pouring down with equally proportional force.  It would appear that this storm is going to be here for a while.  No doubt, the boat shall be delayed…<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	Alas, the “boat” – in reality, little more than the salvaged hull of a doomed merchant vessel balanced atop a barge made of tree logs – does arrive, and only an hour behind the schedule I was given by some frequent travelers back in the Oasis.  (And not a moment too soon either, for although tolerable in temper, the stench of the Ogres of this isle is not.)<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	I boarded the “Bloated Belly” and began reviewing in my mind all the questions I would ask.  I had learned a lot from the sages of the Old World, but many mysteries yet remain.  And if this new friend of mine is indeed the norm, rather than the exception, for the Iksar, then I would indeed be in for a most bountiful journey.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	The boat arrived at the Outpost of the Overthere just before sunset.  Not having explored these lands, I thought it wisest not to set camp here in the open desert.  I got some directions to the nearest forest between the Outpost and the Dreadlands, and made haste to set camp before the dangers of the night came about to hunt.  Had the storm not so delayed my journey, I would have pressed on, but I felt it best to wait out the night in these unfamiliar territories.  I am certain that Vorrin would understand.  I do hope he is still there in the morning…<br />
<BR><BR><br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	…By lunch the next day I found myself in the Dreadlands.<br />
<BR><BR><br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	I find these lands to be far more vast than anticipated.  It would take me hours to cross them.  Fortunately, I ran into a small party consisting of an Elf, a Dwarf, and two Humans.  They set me off in the right direction, but were unable to give me specific instructions to find the place I am seeking.  I shall worry about that when I get there, though.  Surely some things on Kunark will be as they are imagined – such as my master ability to track.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	With little effort, I find myself standing in the entrance of the ice cave separating the tranquil valley from the more hostile regions of the Dreadlands.  I was hoping to find some trace of Vorrin once I got here, but this appears to be a heavily traversed path for would-be fortune seekers.  It would appear that tracking my scaled friend is going to be out of the question today.  It would also appear that many an Iksar travel these parts, and the less-trained eye is not so skilled at telling one from another.  Help will not be found here on this day.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	I set a temporary camp just off to the side of the cave entrance.  While preparing a light snack, I could not help but feel that I was being watched.  It didn’t help much that I kept hearing noises around me as I sat, yet, everywhere I looked, I could find no clue of anyone – or anything – being there.  I think my imagination is starting to get the best of me in these strange lands.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	The next morning, I find myself being awakened by the sounds of a wolf sniffing at my face.  I was unaware that there were wolves in these parts, and had somehow missed the signs of their presence within the forest.  Yet, this is no ordinary wolf, for he is not wholly there.  As my senses come to me, I now recognize this a Spirit Wolf – the companion of a Mystic.  It would appear that my friend Vorrin has arrived; also delayed in his journey!<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	I set up and took to finding him, but disappointment fills my heart as I see none but a Northlander lying next to my fire.  Letting him sleep, I quietly gather my possessions and prepare to head out.  Not wanting to waste a trip to Kunark, I decide to check out a place known as the Lake of Ill Omen – famous for its bountiful hunting grounds among the “softskins”.  Hehe…I have to chuckle to myself at that term.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	As I head through the cave of ice, I hear someone whispering my name from behind.  Turning to look, I see nothing, though.  I pick up my pace, as I am near the exit on the other side.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	Upon reaching the other side, I find young Vorrin, rolling in the snow and laughing hysterically at me!  “I see the young of your kind are just as playful as our own!  It is good to see you again, friend.  I was afraid we would not meet.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“I was here when you arrived, Isssak, but was unable to contact you until today.  There is something strange going on, and I am not yet certain what it is.  My thoughts have been troubling me as of late when I sleep or meditate.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“Come, then.  Let us find some place safe to talk.  I have brought a variety of breads and wines from my homeland for us to sample, as well as a book about Antonica for you to study.  I translated its texts myself.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	He led me to the Lake, pointing out the more popular places for unsuspecting adventurers to meet their doom along the way.  I can’t help but stare in wonder at the many landscapes we passed.  Kunark is much more beautiful a land than the barren deserts of the Overthere would have one believe!<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“I must caution you that not all Iksar will take to the likes of a softskin within our city walls.  Many are still weary of outsiders and hold firm to our freedoms.  They would just as soon destroy any perceived as a threat to our freedom, rather than learn the hard way that they were wrong.  You will have to prove yourself in battle and deed before they will allow you to pass freely through our gates.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“I understand, Vorrin.  As I’m sure you already know, most of us still feel the same about your kind.  Let us hope that the lessons we come to teach each other this day shall help to open the door to new freedoms for both our peoples.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	We taught each other much over the next couple of days.  I present to you in the following texts the stories as related to me by Vorrin Aarikis…<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“I shall recall for you a story.  A story of an Age where Iksar were nothing more than food and slave labor.  It was a time of unimaginable cruelty and oppression.  As legend tells us, the Shissar, a now extinct race of evil snake peoples, defied even the Gods.  For their heresy, the Gods descended upon them the mysterious Green Mists, which dissolved the flesh from their very bones.  In the end, only the Iksar remained, unscathed.  It was at that moment that a new Age began…the Age of the Iksar.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“The stories go on to tell us how it was Venril Sathir of the Kunzar tribe who united all the Iksar tribes as one, and the Mighty Iksar Empire did rule the lands of Kunark.  That is, until the coming of the Ring of Scale.  The ensuing war climaxed with the destruction of the Iksar capital city, but the Dragons paid equally as high a price.  With their leader mortally wounded, the Dragon horde did fall back in retreat.  Many of their remains still litter the Field of Bone – a popular playground for our young broodlings so that they will not forget the lessons of the past.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“These are the stories all young Iksar are taught from the age of their first hunt.  They are forever remembered in sacred teachings and ritual, and in the ancient scrolls penned by the great Dark Mage, Zarkorsis Kunzar.  Zarkorsis, of course, is said to have been one of the original four founding members of the legendary <a href="http://www.vazaelle.net/" title="Knights of the Green Mist" target="_blank">Knights of the Green Mist</a>, thus carrying on his family’s great traditions of leadership within Iksar-kind.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“Tell me about these Knights,” I asked, having always been a fan of cultural histories and the heroes of the lands.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“I will tell you what I know.  Much of their history, however, has been lost,” Vorrin said with what appeared to be a smile, if Iksar can in fact smile.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“Although united, the different tribes of the Iksar still quarreled over how to best proceed.  Some felt it best to expand the Empire and maintain a strict rule over the lands of Kunark.  Others felt that it was time to seek out the help of the softskins.  Many opposed this, however, as they feared it would lead to dependence on the softskins, and that stirred memories of our slavery.  A small sect, not belonging to any one tribe, however, held true to the lesions of the past.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“While the tribes and leaders of the Iksar debated over what to do next, this special group of Iksar, bent only on the freedoms of their race, formed themselves into what would be known as the Knights of the Green Mist, drawing their name from the mists that liberated us from the Shissar.  They elected not one, but four leaders – one from each cast of the peoples…”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“<a href="http://www.vazaelle.net/~xorrin/" title="Xorrin Aarikis" target="_blank">Xorrin</a> Aarikis of the Mystics, Zarkorsis Kunzar of the Brood, Sashara Nathsar of the Crusaders, and Jeet Lee of the Legion.  They would be known as the Knights Council, and they would share power equally amongst themselves.  This was never before done within Iksar society.  Many scoffed at their ideologies, but a wise many more saw their strengths and knew that deep in their hearts, they were right.  The rulers of Cabilis granted the Knights special authority and immunity from Iksar Rule so that they may set forth and restore the Iksar Empire to its former glory without fear of political deadlock.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“The Knights immediately set forth to building their strength.  Taking the best of all ideologies, they recruited not only from within the Iksar Empire, but from without; aggressively recruiting the most talented resources of the Softskins.  They grew fast, and trained hard in their quest to drive the Draconian threat into extinction.  Yes, there was a time when the Knights were not only the most feared, but also the most revered Order of their kind.  As your kind would say, a ‘household name’.”  Vorrin beamed another smile at me, and just then, in the firelight, I caught another glimpse of that strange amulet he wore the night we first met.  I had almost forgotten about it until now, but thought it best not to bring it up just yet.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	I was amazed at the determination and wisdom of Vorrin’s ancestors.  Through the sheer will of their people, they built themselves from a mere slave race to one of the most formidable races known to all of Norrath!  Never before has anything like this ever happened!<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“So, what happened to these Knights of the Green Mist?” I asked, eager to learn all I could from my young Iksar friend.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“The Knights continued to grow, despite that many other Orders of their time struggled for survival.  New lands were discovered and the Knights discovered the existence they were not prepared for.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“In the new lands known as Velious, their early scouts discovered the fate of the Dragon Horde.  It would appear that the Dragons had retreated to and began building anew in the lands of Velious.  The Knights worked diligently to infiltrate and eradicate the Dragon menace.  Many fell in the line of Duty, not only to the Iksar Empire, but also to the whole of Norrath.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“Here is where history fails us, I am afraid.  The records from this point are not clear as to what happened.  Because the Knights did not fall under the Rule of Cabilis, the ancestors of former members and their respective guildhalls from stories and legends tell the only records we have of them.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“I understand, Vorrin.  Please, tell me what you know.  This is all truly fascinating, and if I learn nothing more this season, this would be worth a thousand seasons of exploring!”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	Vorrin chuckled a moment, then continued.  “If you were to ask anyone who the ‘leader’ of the Knights of the Green Mist was, many might tell you the Dark Mage Zarkorsis Kunzar, due to his tribe’s history.  Others who interacted more closely with the Knights might tell you Xorrin were their ‘leader’ (although it is an established fact that the Council of Four held equal power within the Order).  According to Prime Hierophant Vek, in the Temple of Terror, Heyokah <a href="http://www.vazaelle.net/~xorrin/" title="Xorrin Aarikis" target="_blank">Xorrin Aarikis</a> was a strong spiritual leader amongst the Knights, and often played the key role in determining what direction the Knights would move in next.  No Council Member dare issue a vital order to his Faction without first consulting with the great Mystic.  For this reason, Xorrin is the one we think of when someone mentions the ‘Leader of the Knights’.“<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“Right, you already explained that,” I said with a confused look upon my face.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“Yes.  But this is where it is important.  You do not see many Knights in your travels, do you?” Vorrin asked of me.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“No, none at all, actually.  What happened to them?” I inquired.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“Well, the way I understand it is that Xorrin had made a gruesome discovery hidden deep within a cave.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“A Cave?  What sort of discovery was this?”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“Yes, a cave.  Buried deep within a mountain he found some sort of an alter.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“But I <a href="http://www.daughtersofnorrath.com/" title="Daughters of Norrath" target="_blank">don</a>’t understand what that has to do with Xorrin or the Knights.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“True to his Cause to eradicate the Draconian menace from the face of Norrath, Xorrin set about to meditate on this discovery.  It is said that the resulting visions he saw frightened him so much that he could not bare to relive them by telling others.  Shrouded in secrecy, he selected a handful of the most elite of the Knights for a special mission.  They departed for Permafrost where they would train for this special mission for 3 months time.  Grand Master Jeet Lee reported seeing Xorrin and his 5 handpicked companions from time to time as they made infrequent runs to Qeynos for supplies.  (It would appear that Xorrin was somehow able to find friends within the ruling class of Qeynos who permitted him to enter the Human city to re-supply.)  Never, however, would he discuss the mission with Jeet.  The rest of the Council Members grew weary of this mission, but trusted too deeply in Xorrin’s powers and foresight to question his motives.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“During a routine scouting mission, Zarkorsis and Sashara reported having spotted Xorrin and his team returning to the ice lands of Velious.  They gathered what they could carry from their camp and followed him to a cave.  Xorrin’s group prepared themselves with the most powerful of magical incantations that Zarkorsis had ever seen.  Finally, they cast themselves into invisibility (which Zarkorsis and Sashara were both able to see through thanks to their own incantations), and entered the cave.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“Hiding themselves in a similar fashion, the two Council Members followed Xorrin’s group from a safe distance, curious to see what he had held in secrecy for so long.  The caves were lined with life-sized statues of dragons of all breed and lineage.  An alter stood at the end…”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“You see, the alter was, in all actuality, a key.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“What sort of key?” I asked, finding myself leaning ever closer to Vorrin as not to miss any detail.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“The alter was the key to a great city.  A city far more glorious than that of even the Dwarves of Thurgadin!  A city far larger and more towering than Kael itself!  A city of Dragon-kind!”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	I could not help but to gasp aloud in awe at the sheer magnitude of what Xorrin had discovered.  To imagine a city of Dragons was just more than I could handle at the moment.  The size of the thing would fill a score of Freeports!  Hundreds…nay…thousands of dragons living and working together as an organized society.  If such a thing were indeed true, the implications on all of Norrath would be devastating!  No land, no society, could withstand an assault of such magnitude if they were to attack!<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“Something went terribly wrong, though.  Sashara’s invisibility spell wore off not far into the city.  The draconian guards lining the walls immediately took note of her presence.  Zarkorsis was forced to break his veil also and both began to Gate out of the area in the brief confusion of the surprise.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“That wasn’t the worst of it, though.  Before they escaped, Sashara noticed that Xorrin’s group had also lost their invisibility.  Perhaps some unexpected Dragon enchantment protected the area from invisible intruders.  To this day, no one knows exactly what the cause was.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“The last thing Sashara reported to the Knights was that she saw Xorrin valiantly healing and aiding his companions in an overwhelming battle.  He looked her in the eye, she said, and told her to never return or speak of this place again, but to prepare the Knights for what he hoped would never happen.  Sashara gated out just behind Zarkorsis, and none of the others were ever seen again.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	I could not control the feelings welling up inside me at this tragic tale of bravery, not only for the Iksar, but for all of Norrath.  We were so wrong, the Humans, the Elves, the Gnomes and Halflings, and the Dwarves for our decades of mistreatment of the Iksar.  Had we but taken the time to learn of their past, their spirit, we would better understand their ways.  Aye, the God they worship is Cazic-Thule, but as we have seen in others, it is not the God that shapes its people; it is the actions of their heroes and leaders.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“What happened to the Knights after that?  Why are they not still around?”  I just had to know, now!<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“Hehe…you truly do enjoy our history, don’t you, Isak?  Very well, I shall tell you all you wish to know.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“The Knights trained hard for many months after Xorrin’s disappearance.  It did not take long, however, for the lower-ranking Knights to figure out that their Leader was missing.  Try as they might, the Council simply could not hold them together much longer.  The loss of Xorrin was much too significant a loss for the Knights and delivered a crippling blow to their morale.  One from which it seemed they would never recover.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“Realizing that their efforts to hold the Knights together were slowly slipping from their grasp, the Council formulated a new plan.  Jeet and Sashara would form new alliances and reunite the lost Knights under the banner of ‘Tempest of Fate’.  A new storm was brewing, and the Tempest of Fate would be the salvation of all that the Knights stood for.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“But…what happened to them?” I asked, not having seen any of their members for many seasons.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“Unprepared for the task at hand, some of the leadership of the Tempest of Fate fell to…human…ways.  Sorry to have to put it that way, but…”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“No apology needed, friend.  I understand exactly what you mean,” I interrupted.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	Vorrin continued, “It did not take long for the Tempest of Fate to collapse.  No one outside the Council of Fate knows truly what happened.  A few Knights remained loyal, however, and still roam the lands in secrecy.  Today they serve more as information gatherers and scouts, keeping tabs on the Dragon horde and tipping off the larger organizations better equipped to handle such threats.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“Ahh, I see.  Then, I assume that amulet you wear is?”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“Very good, Ranger!  Your eyes are well trained, indeed!”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“And you last name…are you?” I asked.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“Am I?  I am an Aarikis, yes.  One of the, if not the, last of my tribe.  I am not, however, the leader of the Knights.  We have no leader, but rather operate under a secret code of honor to one another and to our Cause.  I’m afraid that we do not even know how many of us are left.  Rarely do we cross paths, except when welcoming new Knights into the Order, or our tasks bring us otherwise together.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“Have you ever considered re-forming the Knights?  Gathering all your resources together and making an assault upon the Dragon city?”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“For one, we do not even know where it is.  Those who do know, Zarkorsis and Sashara, have gone their own ways, and refuse still to tell all that they saw.  All is not lost, though.  Rest assured that the Knights are still here, and we continue to make a significant impact in the service of Norrath.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“Indeed.”  That was all I could say, and we just sat there for what seemed to be hours staring off into the stars.  The fire crackled softly in the background as a zephyr cooled our bodies and minds.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	I presented Vorrin with the book I had brought for him and we spent the next couple hours discussing the many illustrations and locations of Antonica while we ate a freshly caught Deepwater Barracuda.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	Some time passed until we were suddenly interrupted by a group of fortune seekers running through our camp.  “What have you?  Can’t you see we’ve set a camp here?”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“Hail, sire!  My apologies,” replied a robed Gnome.  “We’ve just heard word of a new portal being discovered!  Takes ye to the moon, they say.  Plenty of cheese we’re off to gather!  Moon cheese should bring a nice profit, don’t ya agree?”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“What’s this nonsense you’re talking?”  I asked, more frustrated at the disturbance than the foolishness.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“In the name of Cazic, it cannot be!”  Vorrin looked as if death itself were upon him.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“What is it?  Will someone speak sense here!?” I shouted.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	Vorrin was first, “I have seen these images…images of a massive portal linking all others…images of a sky where the sun and the moon did not rise and fall; but Norrath itself.  Images of…”  He did not complete his thought.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“Images of what, lizard?” the Gnome impatiently retorted.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“No.  It cannot be.”  Vorrin fell silent at that.  “If you will excuse me, I must meditate and consult the Spirits of the Ancients.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	The Gnome’s companions were calling to him to hurry, less they leave him behind.  Not wanting to miss out on his share of the cheese profits, he ran off without so much as excusing himself.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“Come, Vorrin.  Consult the Spirits later.  Let us go and see what is amuck.”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	We soon found ourselves standing at the spires in Dreadlands.  Lying on the ground in the middle was an Iksar, obviously a Shaman.  Vorrin immediately ran to his aid, as no others would help him.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	Badly beaten, bloodied, and near death, the Scaled Mystic was able to utter only these words in, Elder Dragon (as translated by an on looking Wizard), when he glanced up to see Vorrin at his side…<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	“They have not perished.  They survive.  We must hurry.  Gather our forces, son.  There is much work to be done, and no time to waste.  Hurry I say!  We must put a stop to the Shissar before it is too late!”<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	Vorrin cast his Healing spell, as the mysterious Iksar fell unconscious.  Help me, Ranger.  I must get him to the Temple of Terror before it is too late!  I will help you past the guards.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	As we turned the old Shaman over to lift him, I noticed he wore an amulet similar to the one Vorrin wore.  Similar, yet different, for his was larger, and glowed with a mysterious light.  It was almost as if it were not of this world, but of the Spirit World, like the Spirit Companions the Mystics often travel with.<br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	Vorrin took note of it, also.  As we carried the Iksar away (Iksar are quite heavy, by the way) I heard Vorrin say under his breath in the Lizard tongue, “Do not fear, Xorrin, for I shall mend your suffering.  The Knights will reunite under your call.”<br />
<BR><BR><BR><br />
<P ALIGN="justify">	It would appear, as I’ve said many a time this evening, that all is not as it seems…<br />
