  <b>Post subject: </b>Fear Raid Thurs May 17 7pm EST<hr width=95% class="sep"/>
  RL: Rakaabu
<br />
Date: May 15, 03
<br />
Loc: Freerott (Fear Portal)
<br />
Show Time: 7PM EST
<br />
Raid Channel : RoVFear
<br />
Level Range: 46 and up- Number of players : 30
<br />

<br />
 This is mainly for the Epic hits here, in lieu of the epic mobs not being up, we will still clear the zone for armour drops. On that note if you are on your LP and attend the raid Let me Know ASAP. 
<br />

<br />
 Epic drops will be handled at the time of the drops. The exception to this is the Chanter Epic. If it is up and we kill it, it will go to Magiksmithe as it is her LP(Last Piece). 
<br />

<br />
All no drop class armour wil be handled on a list basis. The list will be created by all of that class in attendence roll /ran 1000. The highest to lowest is loot order. This will go for all the classes. I will ask 1 person from each class to hold the loot list. If you are on your last piece of Fear armour please let the list holder know before rolling. LP people will go to the top of the list. Make sure you bring all the pieces you have with you. If you do not have the armour with you, you will roll like the rest.
<br />

<br />
 If there is not enough people or the the right classes I reserve the right to call the raid off. Fear CRs Suck big time.     <hr />

  I think that the Matrix is a good issue to bring up. I have a 50/50 chance of being there and I am sure Chante will be there.  If I don't go I will be happy to be a part of the raid.
<br />

<br />
Only question I have, I haven't seen Magiksmithe in like forever. I thought she left NATO or something <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" border="0" />  Just wondering.
<br />

  Greetings, 
<br />

<br />

<br />
 I was unaware that the matirx is coming out that night.  Well I reschedule it to make it easier for everyone. It's a shame with it being right after the patch the chances of the golems being up are good. On that same note it's a good change the zone will be raided due to that.
<br />

<br />
 I 'll repost a new date once I get one set. Thanks for the info all.
<br />

  I forgot they nerfed the newbie guards, and found out that soloing them isn't much fun.  Oh well, i guess i'll just hope to get an invite on a fear raid from a friend, or get lucky once we reschedule this raid.    <hr />
