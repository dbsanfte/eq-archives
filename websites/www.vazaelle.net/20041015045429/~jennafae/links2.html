<b>WEB DESIGN</b><br>
<a href="http://www.xentrik.net/index.php" target="new"><img src="http://www.vazaelle.net/~jennafae/links/kali.gif"></a><br>
One of my favorite resourses.  Kali has easy-to-follow tutorials for HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Graphic Design basics.
She also has some really sharp website templates that you can download and use if you don't want to write your own script.
I enjoy the clean and simple lines of her templates, and it would be really easy to customize them with your own
colors and graphics.<br><br>


<a href="http://www.lissaexplains.com/" target="new"><img src="http://www.vazaelle.net/~jennafae/links/lissa.gif"></a><br>
HTML Help JUST for Kids ... that means any idiot should be able to figure it out with this site's help.<br>
Read her "About Lissa" page, it's pretty remarkable that this girl started her site when she was 11 years old.  She's 16 now.
<br><br>

<a href="http://www.dafont.com/" target="new"><img src="http://www.vazaelle.net/~jennafae/links/dafont.gif"></a><br>
My favorite freeware font resource.  YAY FONTS!<br><br>


<a href="http://www.pageresource.com/" target="new">Page Resource . com</a><br>
Another web design help site.  <br><br>

<a href="http://www.elated.com/pagekits/" target="new">Elated PageKits</a><br>
More website templates.  This site is nice because it offers the option of downloading the PSD (Adobe Photoshop) files
so you might easily edit the graphics.<br>
...on a side note, they described the "High Life Time Machine" template as 
"a vibrant PageKit with lovely warm colours and a cheeky font!"<br><br>

I haven't yet figured out what constitutes a "cheeky font."

	     <b>WEB HOSTING</b><br>
<a href="http://www.hostsave.com/" target="new">Host Save</a> - $7.95 a month hosting.  This
site was recomended by a friend.  <br>
She says:<br>
"Hostsave.com is reliable, if nothing else. Its not the cheapest, and options like databases and the ability 
to use a phpBB board are not available, but I don't think my website has been down for more then 1 day 
(during that DOS attack a couple months ago) in the past 6 months. Their servers are reasonably fast too, 
no one has complained my site is too slow, and the [message board] signatures I host come up fast."<br><br>

<a href="http://www.inmotionhosting.com/" target="new"> In Motion Hosting</a> - Another recomended by
a friend.  The price has gone down since she purchased her hosting, it's now only $7.95 a month.<br>

She writes:<br>
"I went with In motion hosting (inmotionhosting.com) It's 750mb storage
and 30gb with 50 email accounts and a bunch of other stoof, $10 a month. So far their customer 
service has been excellent! We had a few questions before signing up and logged into their live 
customer service chat room and got instant response, even though it was outside normal bussiness 
hours. Other questions we've had have been answered very promptly, too!<br><br>

Also, they have some of the best down time record I could find, less than 1% during a random 
test month, and that was all in one chunk on one day in the middle of the night, so it seems 
like a planned patch kinda thing. Some of the others had really spotty down time records, 
with random/frequent outages in the middle of the afternoon, evening and other more prime surfing 
time. Plus, inmotion only had a few reviews but every one gave them 10 of 10."<br><br>

<b>DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION</b><br>
What's a domain name?  This is your dot.com.  For example, my domain name is <b>inkymouse.com</b>.  You can also purchase
a .net or a .org.  Hands down, <a href="http://www.godaddy.com" target="new">GoDaddy.com</a> is the cheapest and easiest on the web.<br><br>  
You can can search the World Wide Web database to find out if your dot.com has been taken or not, and
it's only $8.95 per year to register your own domain.  I purchased www.inkymouse.com for two years.  For
free, I also chose 'forwarding' and 'masking' so that my website visitors always see <i>www.inkymouse.com</i>
instead of my actual URL, which is <i>http://www.vazaelle.net/~jennafae/index.html</i>
