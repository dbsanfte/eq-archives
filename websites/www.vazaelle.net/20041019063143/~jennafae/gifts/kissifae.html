August 2003<br>
The first to create something in honor of my love of Faeries!  Kissifur, a.k.a. Liz, of
NS created this little Jennafaerie doll for me using her own self-made doll base.  It's also one of the
few times Jenna has been depicted with red hair, and her hair was red in game for a VERY long time!  Thank you Kissifur,
she's a gorgeous faerie doll.
