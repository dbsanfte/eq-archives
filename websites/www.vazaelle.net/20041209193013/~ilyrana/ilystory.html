                their little girl Ilyrana was born she was a beautiful Girl with 
                blond hear and violet eyes. As Arianis could see a thirst for 
                knowledge and compassion in those violet pools, some day she will 
                be a Great Healer. The years passed, and one day shortly after 
                Ilyrana had learned to walk Mathil had taken her to the near by 
                settlement of Kelethin to do some trading. Wile Mathil was dealing 
                with a wood elven Peddler Ilyrana had wandered out of the settlement 
                and close to the orc camp to the north of the city. Ilyrana was 
                following a small butterfly when an orc centurion spotted her. 
                The orc began to sneak closer to the little girl as Mathil spotted 
                her from the Top of the lift. Mathil called out to Ilyrana but 
                she was to far to hear him. As the orc Crept closer and closer 
                and Mathil was rushing to his daughter&#8217;s aid, and just as 
                the orc was almost on top of Ilyrana a Lighting bolt shot down 
                from the heavens and struck the orc dead were he stood. At that 
                very moment Mathil Know his little girl had been saved by the 
                very hand of Tunare The Mother of All His god and the god of most 
                in Felwithe. He Know she was special.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFCC"><br>
                A few months after the incident with the orc Mathil and Arianis 
                were called away from Felwithe on a mission of great importance 
                to the followers of Tunare. Bertoxxulous the Plaguebringer has 
                been gaining a foot hold in the Pains of Karana and Qeynos Hills 
                and his minions have harmed or killed many followers of Tunare 
                and Karana. A War council was meeting in Surefall Glade to discus 
                how best to deal with this menses and Ilyrana&#8217;s parents 
                were chosen to represent the Followers of Tunare in this matter. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFCC">The Meeting was to begin shortly in attendance 
                was Jorael a Half Elven Ranger to represent the Jagged Pine Folk 
                Mathil and Arianis To represents the Children of Tunare, and Guards 
                Mccluskey and Nash For the Human&#8217;s of Qeynos. The five Representatives 
                sat around the table in the Surefall Glades Ranger Guild when 
                Guard Nash pulled a wand from his belt and Struck Arianis down 
                with a bolt of fire. Mathil Leapt to his feet and yanking his 
                Forlorn Hero's Blade Striking Nash with his spare fist as he did. 
                Jorael jumped back and was pulling his bow from his shoulder when 
                Mccluskey set a Summoning shard on the ground and a Dark Mage 
                Began to appear in it place. Mathil Struck Guard Nash with such 
                force it Cleaved the shield with the Crest of Qeynos Cleanly in 
                half nearly severing Nash&#8217;s arm. As Nash staggered back 
                against the wall the mage that had been summoned to the meeting 
                hall finished his first incantation. A bolt of lightning struck 
                Mathil square in the chest the bolt had stunned him but he was 
                in a berserker like frenzy Brought on by the sight of his wife&#8217;s 
                death, nothing short of his death would slow him. Mathil turned 
                back to Nash who had regained his composer and pointed the wand 
                at him. The mage had finished another incantation this one to 
                summon help two more warriors and a necromancer appeared to assist 
                the mage. Jorael&#8217;s First Arrow Struck home killing the mage 
                in the midst of his next spell. The two warriors that had been 
                summoned by the mage stepped between Mathil and his chosen target 
                giving Nash time to flee form the hall. Mathil quickly dispatched 
                the first warrior but the seconds wasn&#8217;t going to be so 
                easy. This was no mer warrior but a shadow knight a dark paladin 
                a perversion of the purity Mathil had served all his life the 
                Black knight reached out and Mathil was struck with a harm touch 
                a perversion of his own healing power. Jorael&#8217;s Next Arrow 
                struck home in home in the shadow knight&#8217;s back, as he was 
                about to cleave Mathil in two. The Dark Knight turned his attention 
                to Jorael but it was too late Jorael&#8217;s next Bolt took him 
                in the chest killing him. The necromancer was beginning to cast 
                a spell with his staff pointed and Mathil when Mathil&#8217;s 
                Blade cleaved the staff in two the explosion that followed blew 
                the windows and doors from the hall killing all inside.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFCC">After learning of the treachery and carnage 
                the had befallen the Surefall delegation the Priests of the Temple 
                in fell with came to young Ilyrana and told her of her parents 
                Death. The Temple of Tunare would raise Ily now. She was given 
                He mothers Friend and mentor Talanis would raiser her but he could 
                never replace her mother and father. One day Ilyrana and Talanis 
                were walking though the Greater Faydark forest and were beset 
                by orcs Talanis was able to dispatch them but was severely wounded 
                and dying. As Ilyrana Wept over his broken form begging that he 
                not die her hands began to glow and Talanis&#8217;s wounds were 
                healed by the power of Tunare. Ilyrana was Brought before the 
                Council of Priests and they realized she had a gift for healing 
                and decreed she would begin her clerical training at once even 
                though she was seven years shy of the necessary age to enroll 
                in the school of healing. Mathil and Arianis Ty'Quella were thrilled
