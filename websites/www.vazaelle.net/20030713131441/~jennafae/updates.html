06.29.03</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; New portraits in the "Recent" gallery, Jermz and Kumble Bee, both of Eternal Advocates.<br><br>

MAJOR revamping done to the gallery pages.  Lots of images have been moved around, a few galleries combined, and there is now two NEW galleries:  EQPA Dollz Gallery,
and a gallery of Magelo Backgrounds.  Stay tuned soon for this option to be added to the Order form.<br><Br>

06.17.03</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  A new signature portrait in the "Recent" gallery, Yaladen of Epic Heroes.<br><br>

I would like to welcome you to browse the newly opened EQ Screenshot Archives.  This new addition to my site has been created
to provide a resource of interesting and exceptional background and scenic screenshots for use by the vast community of Everquest fan artists.  I have also updated my
Links page, and added a few "PBJ" banners should anyone want to link back to my site.<br><br>

I have been having CRAZY fun since the launch of the <a href="http://www.eqpixelarmy.com">
EQ Pixel Army</a> website a few weeks ago, and have been even more crazy busy in real life..... hence, the portrait requests have piled up
just a tad, so I'm closing the order form temporarily until I can get caught back up.  Check back often for updates as to when I'll be accepting
orders again!<br><br>

You can check out some of my EQ Pixel Army-created dollz <a href="http://www.vazaelle.net/~jennafae/dollz/Dollz.html">here</a>....also, I had a bit
TOO much fun with the dollz <a href="http://www.vazaelle.net/~jennafae/dollz/censored.html">here</a>!  Lastly, make sure you check out the in-progress EQPA guild
portrait of Epic Heroes on the main page.<br><br>

04.13.03</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow, didn't realize that I hadn't updated this page in so long.... OKAY, new work in the "Recent" gallery:  <br>Kklan Shaddowwind of Eternal Advocates (retired)<br>
SpenSir of Epic Heroes<br>
and a new sig for yours truly.  <br><br>

I also updated the "About" page, as I've been in my new guild of Epic Heroes for a while now and had neglected to change my intro paragraph.... Bad Jennafae, BAD GIRL!<br><br>

Lastly, I now have my own thread on <a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/bnorrathsstudio">Norrath's Studio</a> in the <a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/fnorrathsstudiofrm10.showMessage?topicID=124.topic">Artist's Showcase</a> forum.

Due to the high volume of requests I have been receiving, I have altered my pricing to meet demand.  Please visit the "About" page to view the updates.<br><br>

A note on my order form... I do use a form-processing website service, and when I receive a request via my order form here on the the site, 
it comes in the form of an email.  The email comes from the email address that I have registered with the form-processing site... Essentially, it appears 
that I have an email to myself, from myself.  So I must stress that if you do not fill out a form completely, INCLUDING your NAME and your EMAIL ADDRESS, I have no idea
who you are, or how to contact you.<br><br>

Obviously I received a request this week from someone who didn't feel like filling out the entire order form.  As my 3rd grade teacher used to say..."No name, no grade!"

New portraits in the "Recent Commissions" Gallery, Jermz of Eternal Advocates. 


<br><br><b><font color="6666CC">
03.10.03</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The order form is up and running!  Looks great, works great.... I am the Web Master!



<br><br><b><font color="6666CC">
03.07.03</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;WOOT!  I finally revamped my Gallery page, and divided it into several smaller galleries.  They are as follows:  Recent Commissions,
Knights of the Green Mist, Custom Signatures, Early Commissions, The Former Wicked Good, and Self Portraits.  Hopefully these new
pages will help define the lines between the old and the new (the good and the bad?  lol).<br><br>

Also, brand new portraits are up to see.  Please look for Ilyrana Ty'Quella's images in the "Recent" gallery, as well as several sig-lines in the "Custom Sigs" gallery for 
Daeelan Kindherbs, Kadanster, and Ilyrana.<br><br>

I swear I will have the Order Form working in the next few days.  Lastly on my To-Do list, I have had several requests for portraits on servers other than vazaelle.   While
I still PREFER payment in game-money (platinum!), I am working on a pricing sheet for real-world money.  Look for that soon.

Also soon are portraits for Middas Goldtouch, Daeelan Kindherbs, and an engagement portrait for myself and Daeelan (may you always hold my heart, my love).

The Order form is not functional just yet, so please email me with any portrait requests. Also, you can visit <a href="http://www.vazaelle.net/modules.php?op=modload&name=phpBB_14&file=index&action=viewforum&forum=53" target="new">
