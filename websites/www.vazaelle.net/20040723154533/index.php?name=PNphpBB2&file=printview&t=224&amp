  Site Updates: SITE UPDATES
<br />
I am updating the site this week. Expect some downtime as a result.
<br />

<br />
I am currently running backups of the server. Only Vazaelle.NET should be affected by these updates, however.
<br />

<br />
Every measure will be taken to retain all user info, private messages, and forum posts.
<br />

<br />
This is not as big of an update as the last major overhaul, so I am not expecting any problems. The forums are my biggest concern, as they never seem to make the transistion between Forum updates. (This will be a major update for the forums.)
<br />

<br />
Expect things to be visually different, also. Hopefully we will have some graphics throughout the site, soon, also! =)
