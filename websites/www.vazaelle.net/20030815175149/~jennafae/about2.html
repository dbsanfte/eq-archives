<p align="left">Merry Met and Welcome!<br><br>
My name is Erin, I am the face behind InkyMouse.com.  My main character is a druid named Jennafae who currently resides on the Everquest server 
Vazaelle.  <br>I am a proud member of the guild <a href="http://www.epic-heroes.com">Epic Heroes</a>, former officer of Knights 
of the Green Mist, and once-leader of the disbanded guild Wicked Good.  My ventures as a screenshot artist began when
I created a portrait of my character for the Wicked Good website.  I then began creating artwork for 
friends and guild members, and finally started accepting commissions for custom portraits.<br><br>

I have since discovered the fantastic EQ Fanart community of Norrath's Studios, where my interests and talents in 
digital art, graphical design, and web design have nourtured and grown by leaps and bounds.  I still plan to continue
doing EQ screenshot art, but created Inky Mouse to be the new face of my art as a whole, which is branching out in 
new directions every day.  With the closing of my former website "Portraits by Jennafae" and the opening of "Inky 
Mouse" comes the birth of a journey that will hopefully lead me towards design school sometime in the future.<br><br>

I hope you enjoy my site!  Please read further below to find out more about my portraits and pricing, and visit the 
Requests page to inquire about comissioned work.<br><br>

Many thanks to Xorrin Aarikis for hosting my corner of the web on the best server in EverQuest, 
<a href="http://www.vazaelle.net">Vazaelle.net</a>.<br><br>
