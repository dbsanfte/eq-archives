July 2003<br>
I believe this is the first Secret Elf gift I ever received!  I had a rough time
guessing who it was from, as this artist does not typically do Screenshot Art.  Finally after many hints, 
I was thrilled to discover it was Tad of <a href="http://www.jsantart.com/">JSantArt.com</a>.<br><br>
