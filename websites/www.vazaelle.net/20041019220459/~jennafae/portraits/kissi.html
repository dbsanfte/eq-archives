A little something different, this was created as my half of an art trade with another N.S. artist.  Practicing
my mouse-painting skills, the only part of her that is from a screenshot is her face, which is also heavily modified.
My inspiration was a vintage champagne advertisement, which had a painting of a woman in a dress similar to this.<br><br>
