July 2003<br>
These two pieces of art were created for me as exchange gifts by Taylon, of Norrath's Studio.  Tay has a heart of gold 
and I've been watching her talent grow in large strides since last summer (it's now 2004 when I'm writing this).
Thank you Taylon for your friendship and your gifts.
