As most of you all know, I'm a longtime member of the EQ fanart community of Norrath's Studio.  I recently had the pleasure
to participate in my first "Studio Challenge" where artists are assigned another NS member to create artwork for.  It's all
very secretive, as no one knows which artists everyone has been assigned until the day of the turnins.  This particular art
exchange was called "Halloween Howl" and we were instructed to depict our assignment's Everquest character in some sort of 
Halloween costume or Halloween-themed portrait.<br><br>

I was thrilled when I received Lala as my "victim" but also a little nervous.  I'm a huge fan of Lala's anime-style cartoon
artwork (you can view Lala's showcase thread on NS <a href="http://www.raenestorm.org/phpBB4ns/viewtopic.php?t=5378">here</a>).
She's extremely talented and I wanted to create something that would impress her!  I decided to shed my skin as a 
known-screenshot artist and try something new and different for me.<br><br>

<b>This piece of artwork was a huge milemarker for me.</b>  For the first time in YEARS, I picked up a pencil and a piece of paper
and began to draw something of my own.  From start to finish, this picture was drawn in pencil, inked in pen, scanned into
my computer, and then inked and colored in Photoshop entirely by my own hand.  <br><br>

Lala posted on Halloween Howl signup thread that she loved striped stockings and pointy hats.  This information paired along with 
my extreme love of all things Witchy ... well I just couldn't resist!  I present to you Lala's EQ character Aalamadara Warchild as a Witch
for Halloween!  Watch out, she'll put a spell on you!<br><br>
