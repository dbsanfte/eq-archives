February 2004<br>
Tethax of NS has been at it again!  First he made all the cool Nutcracker dollz at Christmas time, and now he's
making hearts for Valentine's day!  He's busy making one for all 60+ Supporters on Norrath's Studio, and this is the
one he made for me.  Teth and I have become friends in recent months, and he knows my addiction to peanut butter.  SO,
my heart is a Peanut Butter heart!<br><br>
