May 2004<br>
Another portrait I created as an exhibition piece for the "What Sign Are You?" Zodiac Contest Challenge I hosted at
Norrath's Studio.  I really had a lot of fun with this piece!  I typically gravitate towards warmer color pallates, so
the cool colors in this one were new and different for me.  I wanted this Darkelf to have a regal Sea Goddess aura around her, 
and was trying to imply that her hair was made from the ocean waves.  I also had never painted fish before and I'm very
pleased with how they turned out!  On a whim, I added the fin along her jawline below her ear during the last finishing touches.<br><br>

I had thought to give her a crown of shells and pearls, perhaps some seaweed in her hair, and a trident in the background.  I
decided to leave these elements out, I felt they would overcrowd the simplicity of the piece.  Maybe next time!
