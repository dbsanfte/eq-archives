I am assuming that you already have a registered User ID for EZBoards, so we'll just skip over that process
and move right onto creating your signature.<br><br>

<b><font color="black">STEP ONE:</font></b>&nbsp;  Hosting<br>
You will first need to find a place to host your image on the web.  There are loads of free image hosting
services on the web.  

<br><br>ALSO, it is important to find
a service that will allow REMOTE LINKING.....what does that mean?  There are many hosting services
that will host your images for viewing directly at their address on the web, but if you try to link
the image for viewing at another location, your image link will be broke (i.e. the little red X we all hate) or
you will see a default image provided by that site.  Why do they do this?  Because remote linking eats up 
bandwidth, which is the amount of data that can be transmitted in a fixed amount of time.  Loss of bandwidth can
seriously slow down the speed of a website or server.  NOTE:  LINKING AN IMAGE DIRECTLY FROM A WEBSITE WITHOUT
EXPRESSED CONSENT OF THE WEBSITE OWNER IS CONSIDERED BANDWIDTH THEFT.  So, don't do it.  <br><br>

<font color="black">Here are the links:</font><br><br>

1.) Norrath's Studio message board has a thread, <a href="http://www.raenestorm.org/phpBB4ns/viewtopic.php?t=704">"Links for Design, Tutorials, & Tips, etc!</a> where you can find several links
for image hosting towards the bottom.<br><br>

2.) EZBoard users have posted remote-linking image-hosting sites on threads <a href="http://beta.ezboard.com/fcooltipsntricksfrm5.showMessage?topicID=259.topic"> here</a> and <a href="http://beta.ezboard.com/fcooltipsntricksfrm5.showMessage?topicID=1172.topic">here</a>.
You can also find information about <a href="http://beta.ezboard.com/fcooltipsntricksfrm5.showMessage?topicID=1212.topic">Direct Linking and Bandwidth Theft</a> on this thread.<br><br>


<b><font color="black">STEP TWO</font></b>  Inserting your Sig<br>
Once you have found a place on the web to host your image, and you're quite clear that it's BAD to link from Jenna's site, you're ready to insert your sig into a custom signature.
Head to <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/">EZBoards</a> and login, or go to your favorite EZBoard message board and click on "My Control Center" to access your account.<br><br>

Once you've accessed your Control Center, click on Account Preferences.<br><br>

<center><img src="http://www.vazaelle.net/~jennafae/tutorials/EZ2.jpg"></center><br><br>

About halfway down this new page, you will want to check the box that says "Use Custom Signature" and you will see a text box below
where you insert your signature code.  You have 3 options here.... Plain Text, ezCodes, or HTML.  I recomend using the "LAUNCH TOOL" next to ezCodes if you have no knowledge of HTML.  If you are comfortable with the basics of HTML, simply enter the URL of your image in the 
text box using HTML code.<br><br>

<center><img src="http://www.vazaelle.net/~jennafae/tutorials/EZ3.jpg"></center><br><br>

FOR THE REST OF US, click on "LAUNCH TOOL" and a new window will pop up that looks like this:<br><br>

<center><img src="http://www.vazaelle.net/~jennafae/tutorials/EZ4.jpg"></center><br><br>

This is really easy.... if you want to insert an image, simply click on the image button and type in the URL.  If you want to create a link, click on the link button.
if you want to center your image, you'll type [center] and [/center] before and after what you want to be centered.  If you want some text above or below your image, just type it in.<br><br>

Once you have finished, scroll down to the bottom and click on "Save Changes"<br><br>

<center><img src="http://www.vazaelle.net/~jennafae/tutorials/EZ6.jpg"></center><br><br>

<Center><h3><font color="black">AND YOU ARE DONE!</font></h3><br>
Head to your nearest message board to test your signature.</center>


<center><h2><font color="black">Inserting a personal Avatar icon</font></h2></center><br><br>

<p align="left">What's an Avatar?  &nbsp;&nbsp;  An avatar is your personal photo or icon that goes below your name
when you post on EZBoards.  Like so:

<center><img src="http://www.vazaelle.net/~jennafae/tutorials/EZ10.jpg"></center><br><br>

To insert your avatar, go to your Control Center, and click on "Edit Profile"<br><br>

<center><img src="http://www.vazaelle.net/~jennafae/tutorials/EZ7.jpg"></center><br><br>

Then, type in the URL of your avatar image wher it says "My Photo"<br><br>

<center><img src="http://www.vazaelle.net/~jennafae/tutorials/EZ8.jpg"></center><br><br>

VERY IMPORTANT:  If the image you have is larger than 60x60 pixels, you will also need to enter the dimetions of the image.  Most EZBoard
message boards do not allow images larger than this, but you can often get around it by entering the true dimensions of your pic.  Also,
when you do this, your image will show up as a red X broken image inside of your Control Center, but it should show up correctly when you
post on the boards.  PLEASE NOTE that you cannot use an image larger than 200x200 or it will not show up even when you post.<br><br>
