I love this sig!  This was created by a Secret Elf on Norrath's Studio ... but it was not long before everyone
was able to guess that it was Sharia!  She created one for each of the members in the NS Supporter Lounge.  You can view them
all <a href="http://pub32.ezboard.com/flegacy10297frm29.showMessage?topicID=112.topic"> here</a>.<br><br>
  
I've always said that Sharia has an amazing way with color and contrast, and these sigs prove it.  You can view
more of her artwork on her guild's message board, <a href="http://pub32.ezboard.com/flegacy10297frm29">Legacy of the Chosen</a>.
