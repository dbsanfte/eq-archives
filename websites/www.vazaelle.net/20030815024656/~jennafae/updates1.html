UPDATES!<br><br>

As you can see, I have figured out how to use Iframes!  WOOT!  These lovely scrolling
window thingys here are the result.  Go me!<br><br>

As of now, only a skeleton of the site is operational.  You will find that
the Signature and Magelo galleries are ready for viewing, although the
Magelo thumbnails do not yet link to the larger images.  The Links page
is also up and running, so please check out a few of my favorite artist's
websites.</p>
