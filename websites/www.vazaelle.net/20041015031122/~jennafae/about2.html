<p align="left">Welcome!<br><br>
My name is Erin, I am the face behind InkyMouse.com.    <br><br>

By day I'm a bookseller at one of the larger national chains.  By night I'm a little bit of everything ... artist, designer,
dabbler, dreamer.  I've been doodling and drawing as long as I can remember, so it's only fitting that nearly every path 
I choose in life leads me in one artistic direction or another.  

When asked what my favorite medium is, I grin and reply "Crayons!"  Lately, however, I've been drawn away from
traditional art mediums and have delved into the world of digital art.  My ventures in digital art began when I created a 
"screenshot" portrait of my Everquest character, Jennafae. For those of you who don't know, EverQuest is a widely popular
online fantasy roleplaying game.  I then began creating artwork for friends and online guild members, and finally started 
accepting commissions for custom portraits. Although I no longer play EQ, I still use my experience as a screenshot artist
as a spring board in all my current artistic endeavors.<br><br>

I discovered the EQ fanart community of Norrath's Studios more than three years ago, where I am now an Administrator.  N.S. has helped my 
interests and talents in digital art, graphical design, and web design to grow by leaps and bounds.  I self-taught myself the basics of 
HTML have since built 5 of my own websites, as well as contributed graphics to several others.  I have also self-taught 
myself the basics of graphic design.  I generally use Adobe Photoshop 7.0, along with my Wacom Intuoso2 graphical tablet.<br><br>

I created <b>"Inky Mouse"</b> to be the new 
face of my art as a whole, which is branching out in new directions every day.  With the closing of my former website 
"Portraits by Jennafae" and the opening of "Inky Mouse" comes the birth of a journey that will hopefully lead me towards 
design school sometime in the future.  As soon as I work up the guts and the cash, I plan to take classes in web design 
and computer graphic design.<br><br>

My love of both art and video games recently led me to a small indie project game called "<a href="http://www.aakrana.com">
Aakrana:  The Forgotten Lands.</a>"  The development team is comprised entirely of programmers and designers who are also 
passionate gamers.  I'm blessed to be working with an incredibly talented group of individuals and I'm learning amazing 
new skills from this experience.  I'm currently priveledged to hold the title of Lead Art Director on the Aakrana project.<br><br>

Things I have done that have nothing to do with art ... <br>
I went to college for less than one semester as an English major, then
dropped out to start school at a techincal college.  I graduated from American Trans Air Aviation Training Academy two years later
with an Associates degree in Aviation Maintenance Technology.  I then said to hell with aviation and got married instead!  I've had
various retail jobs since then, and I presently work for a national bookseller chain where I'm moderately happy.<br><br>

I live in Nashville with my husband Rob and my two cats, Max and Princess.  Princess, named after the Star Wars Princes Leia, is
a black and gray striped tabby and she's very, very fat.  Princess waddled into my life as a stray about 8 years ago and
hasn't left since.  Her favorite pastimes are eating, sleeping, cuddling, and glaring at Max.  Max, named after the boy 
in the childrens picture book "Where the Wild Things Are," is a large and lean black/gray/tan striped tabby.  We rescued
Max from a local shelter where he'd been stealing the hearts of volunteers for nearly 5 months.  Luckily, no on wanted to
adopt and adult cat, only kittens, so clearly he was destined to come home with us.  Max truely is a Wild Thing.  His 
favorite pastimes are terrorizing Princess, running, jumping, playing, and chasing anything that moves.  


Many thanks to my good friend Greg (aka Xorrin Aarakis or Bad Karma) for continuing to host my corner of the web on the best server 
in EverQuest, <a href="http://www.vazaelle.net">Vazaelle.net</a>.  If you would like to continue reading below, I have started 
keeping a virtual scrapbook of things in art and life that influence my work.<br><br>

<u><b>Quotes that I love: </b></u>
(although I am not an avid fan of Dali, I enjoy his philosophy on art and life)<br>
<i>"You have to systematically create confusion, it sets creativity free. Everything that is contradictory creates life."</i><br>
~Salvador Dali<br>

<i>"Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing." </i><br>
~Salvador Dali<br>

<i>"Great art is the outward expression of an inner life in the artist."</i><br>
~Edward Hopper<br>

<i>"How important are the visual arts in our society? I feel strongly that the visual arts are of vast and incalculable importance. Of course I could be prejudiced. I am a visual art."</i><br>
~Kermit the Frog<br><br>

<u><b>Gaming Preferences:</b></u><br>
I typically prefer platform gaming to PC gaming and own a number of systems, although I think I've owned them all at one point
or another.  Presently, my collection includes two Atari 2600, Nintendo, Super Nintendo, Gamecube, PlayStation, PS2, Xbox, original
GameBoy, and Sega Gamegear.  My favorite system of all time is hands-down Super Nintendo.<br><br>

My favorite gaming genre is fantasy roleplaying games.  I'm a die-hard Final Fantasy fan, some of my favorites being FF3, FF7, and
FFX.  I also love the nintendo Zelda series, the old Atari SuperBreakout, Gauntlet, Super Mario series, Champions of Norrath,
Resident Evil, Halo, and Kingdom Hearts.<br><br>

Although not an avid PC gamer, I've become a fan of the MMORPG genre, Everquest especially.  I also love Diablo2, Morrowind, Myst,
and the old Dragon Slayer games.<br><Br>

<u><b>Miscellaneous pastimes</b></u> ...<br>
I love to wear pajamas and I collect striped socks.  I'm a very good cook but I hate to do the dishes.  I like Ginger Ale and cheese,
fruit, seafood, and pasta.  I never cook anything that doesn't have onions and garlic in it ... well, except desserts and stuff, but I don't
really like sweets.  I believe in faeries and monsters under the bed.  I think a house is not a home without a fat cat or two.  I like the smell
of mulled cider and dryer lint ... but not together.  I'm allergic to metal jewelry and the silent treatment.  I once painted an entire room orange.
