  hehe...oh well.
<br />

<br />
Was really looking at the MST time zone, since I am from that time zone, and know the conversion...just added rather than subtract the hour.  <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Still the same time here.
<br />
And it's still July 4th here.
<br />
So I still have the day off.
<br />
And I'll still be there (if I don't sleep in - lol)     <hr />
