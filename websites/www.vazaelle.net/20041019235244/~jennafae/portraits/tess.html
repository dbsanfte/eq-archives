I did this portrait for my good friend Tessien, who has been my confidant and druid mentor in game for ages.
He's a very funny guy who has more lady friends than anyone I know!  He also has an emote hotkey that everyone
has come to know and love (loathe?) that says "Tessien pinches Jennafae's hot woodelf body."  I could not resist
doing a picture of him, poking fun of him!
