A gift for Desmerelda, a former guildmate, I really fell in love with the barbarian female dance emote.  Poor Dessy, I forced her
to do it over and over again!  This was created around the time that I got Photoshop and was one of the first pics with
PS-created spell effects.  The rest of the portrait, including the hair was created with Picture-It.
