  I am a monk.
<br />
I will die quickly and cry if I try and tank.
<br />
I wear leather and envy those who look cool in plate.
<br />
I will find the biggest nastiest group of mobs a zone has to offer.
<br />
I will train them on your head FD and laugh.
<br />
I am a monkey....I fling poo.     <hr />

  I must say, I have been insulted before but that..that really takes the cake. I must say dear friend I do not whine and cry unless mommy leaves me at home with no food. I have flung poo only when it was called for and not once have I pulled a train on a helpless victim without good cause, such as your cute little poem. So, keep your ears open, for when you hear the lonesome whistle and feel the tracks a rumbling the cannonball express is coming for you  <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />     <hr />
