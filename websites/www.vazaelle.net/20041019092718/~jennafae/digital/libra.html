May 2004<br>
I created this as an exhibition piece for the "What Sign Are You?" Zodiac Contest Challenge I hosted at
Norrath's Studio.  It was my first try at a photo-manipulation piece and I learned a lot about the anatomy
of the human face in the process.  This piece pays tribute to my RPG character, the Woodelf Druid Jennafae, 
and also to my own Sun Sign of Libra.
