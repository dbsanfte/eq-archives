<b>12/03</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Created by Tethax Firestorm of Norrath's Studio.  Tethax created the base for this Nutcracker doll
entirely from scratch and pumped out an entire NUTCRACKER ARMY of NS Supporters.  I think in the end, 
he created more than 60 Nutcracker dolls for the crowd in the Supporter Lounge, each one as different and
unique as the members they were created for.<br><br>
