I love this picture!  This is the first and only 3D rendition of Jennafae ever done.  Thankfully I did 
not have to guess who made her, because everyone else did the guessing for me!  This beautiful Faerie 
Jenna was created by Starrydance of Norrath's Studio.  I love her wings and her leather druid armor.  You 
can view more of Starry's work at her website,
