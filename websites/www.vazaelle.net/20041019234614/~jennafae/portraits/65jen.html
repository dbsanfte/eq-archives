This project was a huge challenge, due to how many new things I was trying all at once.  With the 
dingage of level 65, I was way overdue for a self-made portrait.  I did extensive repainting of Jenna's
face, hair, and armor, along with an entirely hand-painted background and cloak.  This was not long after
I received my graphical tablet, but at this point
I was starting to feel a lot more comfortable with using it and was able to do much of
the repainting and detail work without the use of my mouse.<br><br>
