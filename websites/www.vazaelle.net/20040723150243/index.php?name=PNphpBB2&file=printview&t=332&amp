  I will be leading a Xanamech raid at 4pst (Thats 6 central/7 eastern for you time zone challenged like me =))
<br />
Since Phil is coming home, we're going to be short Sweety and Gindorf as well. Going to definately need someone to babysit gnome. This is my first attempt at leading a real raid, so please be patient with me and I will appreciate any help or advice you can give. 
<br />
Please try to be in tranquility by quarter til, I will be assigning group leaders then, and thanks for coming if you come, I plan on this mechanical nightmare to go down!     <hr />

  Sorry the support was not there for you Joe...I truly wanted to see the Nato Saturday event stay alive.  I guess we can try again tomorrow we'll have to see who is online.     <hr />

  It helps if you can post raid announcements at least a week in advance, to give everyone time to make plans.
<br />
Hopefully I will be able to attend this raid the next time it's attempted!  <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />     <hr />

  We probably should have the raid set up before hand, truth be told when you guys aren't around this is what happens. It's not a bad thing, just they follow you.  <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />     <hr />

  Consistancy.  That's the key to getting followership.
<br />
Once you've established yourself as a confident and consistant leader, others will follow.
<br />

<br />
It might help, also, to start with a target mob that hasn't wiped us 3 out of 4 tries.  lol     <hr />

  That's the plan. You put out the call for peeps to step up and that's what I'm going to do. Twas my first time out and it didn't go as planned. It happens. I probably would have had a better turn out if it would have been announced earlier. That's the key to being a leader, dust yourself off when you fall, not have a meltdown, and do it again.     <hr />

  lol...well, you certainly have the mindset for it, Joeshaboobi!  Keep it up.     <hr />

  That's the biggest key Joe.  Most people are not raid leaders, but they're willing to follow them.  People who keep at it will get better results as they go, and more and more people will follow.  Sometimes you just need to go through a rough stretch though.
<br />

<br />
Heck, you made Xorrin blink.  That has to count for something!     <hr />

Unfortunately that's not possible in most cases on mobs that are farmed fairly regularly, the exceptions being that you know exactly when it will pop (uncommon) or you have an agreement with everybody else on the server to let you take it. (not likely)  plus if you post a week in advance there are a few who would go and kill the mob just before you do to spite you.
<br />

<br />
The best way to set up a regular raid is to have people ready to raid, expecting and anticipating it, while a group of trackers scouer norrath, luclin, and the planes for targets.  when a target is decided on you move the raid force to it and commence to kill and get phat lewtz.
<br />

<br />
The key is for the people to want to raid.  Nobody should be starting a LDoN within 1 hour of the scheduled raid time.  anybody in a group should have a replacement ready within 30 mins of the raid time or the group should know they are being ditched because you've got an uber fun raid to go to.  If nobody is around to lead the raid somebody should step up to the duties.  it's best that this person know the hit inside and out, or know somebody else who does as a source for information. (NEVER let the raid know you're pulling info from somebody else, you're leader, you're issuing orders, where you get info from should be confidential)
<br />

<br />

<br />
This is very true, and consistency also guarantees lots of raid leadership abilities. (yes, they stack with group leadership abilities)  an established leader will be followed much more quickly than somebody else stepping up.  the person stepping up may know just as much about the hits, may know how to manage people, but until they have gained the raid's trust they can't lead it.  gain that trust by establishing yourself as a raid leader.
<br />

<br />
that's enough of my rambling for now...tune in next week for more...     <hr />

  Actually, as far as hitting Xanamech is concerned, I could lead that one pretty easy. We've done it enough that I know the turn ins, the Gnome babysitter duties, and the fight itself well. I felt it was a good hit to start with. But like I said, I'm not discouraged, I'm only more stubbornly insistant that I set more targets up. <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" border="0" />    <hr />
