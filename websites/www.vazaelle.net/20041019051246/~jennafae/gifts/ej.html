January 2004<br>
I comissioned this sig from Kelly at <a href="http://www.celstudios.net/index.html">Cel Studios</a>.  I have always loved her artistic style, and I knew
she could pull off a text-only sig for me with ease.  I wanted something with an earthy and architectual
feel to it, something WITHOUT Jennafae's name on it, and I provided a list of some artisit quotes that I enjoy for her to choose from.  
I was thrilled with the end results.  She even included my favorite colors, orange and olive green.
