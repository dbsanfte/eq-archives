I had a blast with the spell effects on this portrait.  This is one of my earlier attempts at hand painting hair, 
I have improved greatly since.  A gift for another screenshot artist, Blondx is extremely talented so I 
wanted this one to be perfect.  Blondx created an amazing magelo background for me, which you can view in the 
Gift Gallery.
