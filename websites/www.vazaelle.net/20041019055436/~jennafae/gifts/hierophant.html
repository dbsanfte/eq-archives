August 2003<br>
This portrait was created for me to comemorate Jennafae's rise to level 60 in 
Everquest.  Under the guise of Secret Elf, Pedi Dustyboogs gifted NS Supporters with amazing 
repaints from photographic reference.  It was nearly 6 months before she revealed her identity, it's 
fairly amazing I kept the secret that long!<br><br>

You can view more of Pedi's artwork on her website, <a href="http://www.flinthammer.org/pedi/">Flinthammer</a>.<br><br>
