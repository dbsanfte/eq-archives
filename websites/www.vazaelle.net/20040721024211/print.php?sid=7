<font class="print-normal">HERE YE!  HERE YE!<br />
<br />
By order of Xorrin Aarikis, Grand Hierophant of the mighty Iksar Empire, leader of the noble Knights of the Green Mist, all officers and those who so desire to fill open commissions are hereby directed to make their formal requests in the KGM Forums!<br />
___________________________<br />
<br />
KGM will be undergoing some major changes in organization.  THIS IS YOUR FAIR WARNING.  If you are an officer, it is (and always has been) required of you to be active on the web site.  If you are not, you will loose your commission.  We have too many officers who are not doing their jobs!  We have too many people who have earned the right to a commission, but lack the spots to put them in.  We are going to fix this very soon!<br />
<br />
ALL OFFICER POSITIONS, FROM TOP TO BOTTOM, ARE GOING TO BE REASSIGNED.  Starting with the Knights Council, and working our way down the line.  What this means for you is, if you want to be an officer, NOW is the time to let us know.  (DO NOT PM YOUR REQUESTS!!!!  ALL POSTS SHALL BE MADE IN THE PUBLIC KGM FORUMS FOR THE ENTIRE GUILD TO COMMENT ON.  ANY PM REGARDING OFFICERS WILL BE DELETED - UNREAD!)<br />
<br />
If you are already an officer and wish to change or resign your commission, now is the time to let it be known.  If I do not hear from you, on this site, I will assume you do not have an opinion either way, and you may very well LOOSE YOUR COMMISSION.  Again, do not PM me...and do not send me a /tell in game.  If it is not in the forums, then you can bet I will either not remember, or misplace it.  I simply have too many RL things going on with work and the other MMORPG project to remember every detail of a /tell.  ;)<br /><br />
