<font class="print-normal">For those who don't know (which should be everyone, since Gindorf is the only person I told in advance), I have quit EQ, deleted all my characters on all 4 of my accounts, cancelled all subscriptions, deleted all installations and utilities related to EQ on my computers, and thrown out all copeies of the game I own.  I have no intention of returning to EQ, nor will I be playing EQ2 (I cancelled my pre-orders for that, already.)  I did all this on the day that I made Regis Guild Leader.  Even he did not know my intentions at the time.  The next day, I left for Saipan.  In less than 24-hours, all EQ sites hosted on my server will be deleted.  NATO, KGM, Vazaelle.NET, and all other guild sites.  I will make no backups.  All EQ email accounts will be deleted, also.  The server will change IP addresses, too, as a final measure, as I will be using it for another project which I have been active in since May of this year.  I apologies to everyone for not explaining or warning that this was coming...it was my intent to pass everything to Regis and fade into the history that has kept KGM great since day one of the Vazaelle Server.  For those of you who wish to keep in touch with me, You can find me at any of my email accounts NOT related to EQ, any of my various messenger accounts not related to EQ, or on the Project site.  (I will not be telling anyone who does not already know what the name or URL of the project is.)  I will not answer any messages, questions, etc.  EQ has taken too much from me for too many years.  I leave it without regret.  I loved my time and everyone there.  I simply must move on, and my role as Executive Producer and Lead Developer for this new game is the next level I will be participating in MMORPGs from now on.  No longer will I be just another player, sinking thousands of dollars into a game with so little return.<br />
<br />
Safe Hunting, and I hope to see you all in the Forgotten Lands (hint) in the future.<br />
