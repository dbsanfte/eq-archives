This gorgeous 3D portraits was created by Starrydance as a gift to the entire Supporter Lounge at Norrath's Studio.
I think she's beautiful!  Please visit Starry's website, <a href="http://www.dreamflyght.com/">Dreanflyght,</a> I
know you'll be in awe of her talent.  She not only does exceptional 3D art, but she also draws digital cartoon art, and pixel
art.<br><br><br>
