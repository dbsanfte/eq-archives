			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should always recognize the champions of Norrath that we've encountered.  These people go out of their way to help others, or are one's who have done extraordinary deeds to benefit Norrathian life.  If you've met someone you feel belongs on this list, e-mail me with your story (<a href="mailto:ludarian@epicshadows.com">Ludarian@epicshadows.com</a>)<br><br>

 			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FAE42B"><b>Manluin</b></font> - Manluin is one of our newest members of the guild and has been a great asset since day one.  This is Rithmorin's account of the help he received from Manluin, and I agree this is one exemplary Shadow:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>I am in the US ARMY and just prior to the bombing of the WTC in NY my character died in The Overthere.  As a result of the bombing my unit was deployed and I was working long hours and not able to get my corpse back.  Now that things are slowing down I have had time to reunite with the guild and unfortunately try to play a guy with NO armor weapons or coin.  Manluin came to my plea for help when no one else did.  He traveled a great distance to get me armor and even spent a few nights trying for the sole purpose to find me a decent weapon.  After 4 long nights of wandering In High Hold trying to make due with what little coin I could scrounge up, Manluin gave me all that I needed in terms of armor weapons and a new friend that I trust.  He is one that truly needs the gold status.<br></i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well done Manluin!  Your dedication and sacrifice is an example for all of us.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FAE42B"><b>Akronis</b></font> - I got an overwhelming response the night Akronis was nominated for the gold list.  His complete commitment to Epic Shadows was shown in his selfless donation of a Centi Longsword to the guild fund raiser.  This act was only the latest in a long history of hard work and self sacrifice that this Shadow Knight has had with us.  It's my privilege to add Akronis to our gold list.
<br><br>
 			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FAE42B"><b>Nuala</b></font> - Nuala has been a member for quite a while.  Trying to think of a time when she wasn't in the guild is pretty hard :).  Nuala's gold list nomination comes from Naemaru as well as Rueeliar, who records this account of Nuala before coming to the guild:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Before I joined the guild, she put forth more effort into helping me 
than anyone else in the game.  When I was much lower, she spent EIGHT HOURS 
helping me repeatedly run from Neriak to Lake Rathetear to help me find my 
corpse.  I died over and over on the run, but each time, she helped me find 
my new corpse, and even covered the repeated ports out of her own pocket.  
If not for her, I most likely wouldn't have recovered, and may have left the 
game out of frustration.  Instead, she restored my faith in the fine players 
of this game.  She was the first person to make it on my friends list, and 
has been a dependable friend since then.  I was recruited by someone else, 
but it was her presence in this guild that made me overjoyed to join and 
overjoyed to stay.  I was there when she and Akronis helped Naemaru do the 
first FIVE steps of her epic... at level thirty-four!  Even Nuala died twice 
during the attempt, losing level 53, but she didn't sweat it or worry about 
it.  She has spent so much time helping me that I doubt I will ever finish 
paying her back.

I can think of very few people I believe deserve it more... one of which is 
already on the gold list.  *chuckle*<br></i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NUALA!!! Great to have you with us :)
