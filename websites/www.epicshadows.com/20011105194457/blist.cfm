			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is truely unfortunate that we should have to consider making such a list.  One would like to think that we could go about our lives without meeting the scum and filth of Norrath.  These are those that surface long enough to convince everyone of their stupidity, selfishness and inhumane behavior.  The Worst of the Worst as you might say, who do nothing to better your experience, yet try hard to make life as difficult as possible.  We do this as a service to allow others to know of the attitudes that these players have and to help prevent others from having the same bad experiences.<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="red"><b>Ghola</b></font> - Beware. This is the foul lizard that inspired us to make this list.  Before the unfortunate experience I had meeting with him I thought that the worst people in Norrath were KSers, or just those with bad mouths.  Never did I imagine that someone would lower themselves to the tactics of this vile trash, let alone the reason for his behavior.  Sabrar had been camping the Assasin Supplier for quite a while in lower guk.  He had gotten the supplier alone, and decided to wait a bit before attacking him since I and Quendin were on our way in.  However, a poor excuse for a player named Xeroiv came in to the scene. Fearing a camp steal, Sabrar attacked the Supplier, then shortly after Xeroiv feared it, causing it to run from Sabrar, then Xeroiv continued to kill it and loot it.  He was petitioned immediately and was confirmed as a KS from the GM.  As an act of service, Sabrar annouced to the zone that Xeroiv was kill stealing that others should beware incase he tries to take your camps as well.  That's when the incredible genious of stupidity, Ghola, became a scourge upon Norrath.  Ghola announced he'd rather be a KSer than a whiner, which is a solid display of his lack of morals and honor.  Sabrar was not whining, only informing the zone of this unfortunate encounter.  Now Ghola in all his immense intelligence felt that the best way to resolve this situation was to train about 5 ghouls into our camp, FD, hop down and train an additional group of Ghouls, and FD again.  This caused Sabrar to luckily FD, me to gate and Quendin to die an unfortunate and unneccesary death.  For this act of hate Ghola is declared the worst player on Vazaelle.  He should not be associated with by any Shadow, or any others who have a sense of honor.
