 			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FAE42B"><b>Nuala</b></font> - Nuala has been a member for quite a while.  Trying to think of a time when she wasn't in the guild is pretty hard :).  Nuala's gold list nomination comes from two people:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First from Naemaru: <i>I've got a pretty wild story to detail you. As well as two nominations: a SECOND nomination for Akronis, and a first for Nuala. You probably might find this rediculous, but I started my epic at 34. Yep, a mere level thirty-four. It started out that Pinlacke, Rueeliar, Esharp, Mandaar, and I were running from N. Karana to Rathe Mtns for some Hill Giant hunting. I remembered that mine and Mandaar's epics started in Lake Rathe and while we paused there, I checked the doc I had saved detailing the quest and realized the first two mobs were only about roughly lvl 40 and in the Lake Rathe zone. After printing out all nine or so pages, I logged back on and let everyone know and checked to see if they wanted to give it a head start since there were two Clerics. Sure! we all said, and Rabyd came along to give us a hand.
Due to some miscommunication, I died twice and we couldn't mind Lord Bergurgle, the deepwater goblin hanging around in a tower under the island in the middle of the lake. Most everyone had to log except for Rue and I but Nuala, being as far as I can tell almost completely selfless and adventure-loving, decided to come along and see if she could give us a hand. She helped enormously, especially considering the rather absurd circumstances: a lvl 34 starting her epic weapon. Akronis, being so totally silly, came along just for fun.
After two or three deaths for me, Rueeliar, and Nuala (and a couple 90% rezzes from a wandering Cleric) and about three hours (it was now around 12am PST), we were pretty worn out and more than a little disappointed. Bergurgle's PH had spawned twice but hadn't popped himself yet. As everyone got ready to camp/gate/quit, I swam up to the top of the tower to check one last time; low and behold, there was Lord Bergurgle. After much squealing on my part (and Rue getting up to check my screen to see if I was making a cruel joke) we took him down in about thirty seconds flat and he dropped the crown, just as I needed. I thanked everyone profusely and started to say good night when Akronis and Nuala insisted we try to FINISH my EPIC QUEST that night. *laughs* I kid you not. So we ran up, turned in the crown to Shmendrik Lavawalker, watched him get gakked by Natasha Whitewater as planned, killed his spirit in about fifteen seconds, and got the next part. After turning the now-ruined crown drop into Natasha Whitewater, Akronis bribed a weary Druid to port us to Lavastorm, as I needed to take on yet another ~40 named goblin. We slaughtered half the zone easily and played with summoned party favors for about 45 minutes before Lord Gimblox popped and dutifully dropped my needed quest item.
More Druid bribing to South Ro since our next stop was Timorous Deep. After a brief turn of slaughtering things just in case the AC would pop (Me: *laughs* HEY LET'S FARM J BOOTS ! Akronis: Sure, incoming an ancient cyclops. Me and Rue: !()*%)(%(#*^%*# !!), we took the boat to Timorous and ran around for another two or three hours looking around for the extinct volcano oasis where my quest NPC waited. I crashed several times but Nuala and Akronis graciously waited for me at the oasis despite the fact that they were ready to pass out and Rue was pretty much snoring on her desk and almost drowning while looking around for lost me. I arrived at the oasis at around 4am PST and we discussed the rest of my quest: the Plasmatic Priest in Sol Temple, Ixiblat Fer (for which there is unfortunately a line, as Rue just informed me -_-;; ), the Overking, Bathezed, and Zordack Ragefire with whom I need to speak to in Sol B and now in Skyfire, as he was moved. Nuala and Akronis have assured me they'll help organize raids and assist in the rest of my epic, as well as offer an support I might need in getting high enough for it to actually proc. Thus I would like to nominate Nuala for the Gold List after all her selfless devotion to a ridiculous-sounding cause, as well as re-nominate Akronis for being such a fun and helpful addendum to Nuala.<br><br>

Thanks for your time,<br>
Laura "Organa Solo"<br>
AKA Naemaru Raphaelstear<br><br>
</i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from Ruelliar:  <i>Before I joined the guild, she put forth more effort into helping me 
than anyone else in the game.  When I was much lower, she spent EIGHT HOURS 
helping me repeatedly run from Neriak to Lake Rathetear to help me find my 
corpse.  I died over and over on the run, but each time, she helped me find 
my new corpse, and even covered the repeated ports out of her own pocket.  
If not for her, I most likely wouldn't have recovered, and may have left the 
game out of frustration.  Instead, she restored my faith in the fine players 
of this game.  She was the first person to make it on my friends list, and 
has been a dependable friend since then.  I was recruited by someone else, 
but it was her presence in this guild that made me overjoyed to join and 
overjoyed to stay.  I was there when she and Akronis helped Naemaru do the 
first FIVE steps of her epic... at level thirty-four!  Even Nuala died twice 
during the attempt, losing level 53, but she didn't sweat it or worry about 
it.  She has spent so much time helping me that I doubt I will ever finish 
paying her back.

I can think of very few people I believe deserve it more... one of which is 
already on the gold list.  *chuckle*<br></i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NUALA!!! Great to have you with us :)
