			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the guild has grown it becomes apparent that we need constant direction and goals to help everyone to achieve all of their desires as we fight together in Norrath.  This charter will continue to evolve over the upcoming months to help direct each one of us and to inform everyone of their responsibilities, expectations and guidelines/rules of being an Epic Shadow.  Please comment to Ludarian if you have a topic that you feel should be discussed in this document.<br><br>
<font color="#87BBF5"><b>New Members</b></font> - It is exciting to welcome new people into the guild and make a new friend that we are able to fight with.  We have learned as the guild has progressed that raids are successful when we have a high attendance and high interest.  Also, the better raids are planned the better the outcome.  With this in hand we need to narrow our focus on the raids we plan in the future to help all of our members have a good experience at a raid rather than have two separate raids between lower and higher levels.  To this end we will be activeley recruiting members at 46+.  Members of other levels will be able to get allowance, but will be warned that activities and exp groups for your level range will be very very rare.  Members recruited at less than level 46 will be encouraged to level quickly to be able to benefit from the guild.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are currently recruiting enchanters and will welcome active enchanters of most levels.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this level cap there is going to be a high expectation placed upon guild members.  In order to keep things organized, we may have to start removing guild members that are unable to reach this goal after they are given a sufficient amount of time.  It is unfortunate that we would have to do this, but it is a prime requirement as a Shadow to benefit the guild by your own advancement.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please note the following restriction on alts:  <b>You may have alts in the guild if you have a main character over lvl 46</b>.  If you do not, leveling should be your priority.  We encourage you to experiment and play as many classes as possible along with progressing your main character.<br><br>
<font color="#87BBF5"><b>Officers</b></font> - This section will help outline how officers are picked and what extra requirements are expected out of them.  Officers are picked on the following:
<ul type="circle">
	<li>Guild reputation:  Those that are highly respected will be considered first.</li>
	<li>Participation:  Being actively involved in guild activities and helping others as often as is prudent.</li>
	<li>Your play skill:  Knowing your class and working well with others not only makes you a better player but also will help you be a better officer.</li>
	<li>Organization:  Raid and activity planning skills are some of the most challenging attributes you can obtain.  Those with abilities to do this successfully will be highly regarded.</li>
	<li>Recruiting:  The ability to recruit others that are high levels is a respected talent and will be one of your most useful and required attributes as an officer.</li>
</ul><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers have higher responsibilities than members since they help grow and direct the guild.  Officers will be expected to leave their own situations to attend guild matters as it is required.  This includes their attendance to guild raids and events when online and also going to invite others into the guild.  An officer who does not go to welcome a new person into the guild will be warned.  Also, extended game absence by an officer without warning can result in removal of his/her status upon return to the game, which will be decided by other officers and the guild leader.  Officers are expected to organize events and raids frequently.  Once a month would be a goal to shoot for as that would give us several planned activites per week.  Officers should also be the first ones helping members to achieve their level requirements.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becomming an officer is an achievement and will be treated as such.  We will implement ceremonies to help welcome new officers.  Also, each officer will be more involved in helping pick other officers.<br><br>

<font color="#87BBF5"><b>Guild Pride</b></font> - As a Shadow you should participate in several aspects to help build up every other member.  This is what is expected from each member.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We request all Shadows not to use the Anon tag.  Displaying your guild name helps others see our powerful members.  Also, by showing your level it will also let them know how strong we are as a whole.  The Roleplay tag is considered appropriate to some classes as things can become irritating.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Willingness to help.  Members should always try to answer questions in guild chat and offer assistance when prudent.  We should treat others with respect and help them with our input.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temperance.  At times the game can be very frustrating.  The guild is not a punching bag when things do not go right.  Anyone using profanity in guild chat will be warned.  Anyone that gets visibly upset in guild chat will be spoken too.  We should also understand that if we ask a question in guild chat and don't get an answer then it is because members are either really busy or just don't know or can't help.  We should never accuse members of being unfair or unwilling to help without specific evidence.  Whinning will also not be tolerated whether it is for help, items or loot from a raid.  Whiners will be spoken too.  The following is a list of specific actions that are unacceptable:<br>
<ul type="circle">
	<li>Guild Chat Repetition: Do not ask for items or pling more than once a day, and do not try to sell an item more than once every couple hours.  If no one answers your question, just assume that they do not know the answer or are not interested in what you are trying to sell/buy.  Also, items will be given to high level characters before low level characters as this will benefit the guild more.  Understand that our priority is to have everyone level and <b>then</b> look for uber gear.</li>
	<li>Guild Chat Arguing:  If you are not an officer, you do not have the authority to correct someone over guild chat.  Most arguments are caused by money issues.  Do not subject the rest of the guild to your bickering, it will ruin guild morale.  Issues that need to be dealt with should be directed to an available officer or the guild leader.</li>
</ul><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example.  Every person in Norrath should be able to regard the Shadows highly.  You are expected never to do anything that doesn't represent your guild well.  Whether that is being dishonest, rude or annoying to any person it is not acceptable.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation.  This is a game and I want to emphasize that before I start this section.  I don't like the idea of requirements, but these requirements I feel will help every member have a better experience.  Raid and activity participation is all but required.  If you are online, by default you are expected to come to them.  Extenuating circumstances exist, but should be rare.  Those that are online who are not attending a raid will be sent a message by the raid organizer.  Real life has it's own circumstances (unfortunately) so it's understandable that members cannot come to every raid.  But, it is up to each member to participate in the forums and in guild chat to help us know the best times to plan raids so that we can get the best attendance possible.  Also, you should <b>actively check the website and forums</b> for updates and info on the upcoming guild activities so you know when you can plan to be online.  Participation is the best way to ensure that you benefit from guild activities.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that every member and prospective member reads this and we hope it helps us to have progressively better experiences.  Also we hope that this serves as a guide to get us to our common ultimate goal, Dragon raids and Epic quests.  We also want to have your input, so any questions or comments, e-mail them to <a href="mailto:ludarian@epicshadows.com">Ludarian</a>.
