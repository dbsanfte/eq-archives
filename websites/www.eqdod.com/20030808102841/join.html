If you are interested in joining Disciples of Domination, please go <A HREF="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fdisciplesofdominationfrm38" target="_new">here</A> and put in the information requested.  Officers will get in contact with you and will group with you to get more aquainted.

If a guild invite is extended, the new member will be on a probationary period of two weeks.  During that two weeks, a mentor within the guild will be assigned to you to answer any questions that you have and to facilitate grouping with officers in the guild.  After the two weeks expire, officers will vote on your membership.  It takes two officers to vote down a member and a majority of officers must vote on any new member.  You must agree to the charter on our website in order to be extended an invitation into our guild.

Please be aware that we adhere to the EULA and that we do not extend invitations to players that have been Ebayed.
