<FONT COLOR="#ffaaaa"><B>Notice: As the EQ Guild DoD is coming to a close, this site will soon be changed to a site hosting personal projects, sigs for friends, and that's about it. There will be a mention as well as a link left in place for the old DoD Guild board, but the page will not automatically redirect once this change is made. Any questions or comments may be sent <A HREF="mailto:barfalimule@eqdod.com">Here</A>.<BR><BR>
Take care former friends.
