In order to provide a guild that promotes honesty and honor, we must have a framework to build upon.  This framework consists of guidelines that should be adhered to for the good of our guild and of the Everquest community.  These guidelines may change periodically.  You should check back from time to time and we will do our best to discuss these online and in our forums.  Anyone going against these guidelines will be given a warning for the first offense and removed from the guild for any further offense.  This is not an absolute however; the guild leader and officers may change this policy as situations warrent.
<BR><BR>
1.  Disciples of Domination (DoD) will abide by the EULA of EverQuest first and foremost. This includes not accepting applications from characters which have been purchased and immediately disbanding any members that are found to have broken this rule. 
<BR><BR>
2.  Kill stealing will not be tolerated by anyone in our guild.  Accidents happen, but it is your responsibility to apologize and try to make amends.  This applies to "camps", spawns, and gameplay in general.
<BR><BR>
3.  Never hide your guild tag (/anon).  Our reason for having tags is to show others the pride we have in each other and our guild.  You may choose to role play (/roleplay) if you wish to hide your level or class without hiding your guild affiliation.
<BR><BR>
4.  Refrain from using vulgar or offensive language in ooc, group talk, shout, tells, say, or guild chat.  We all get a little upset at times, but please use discretion when venting your frustration.
<BR><BR>
5.  Respect each other at all times.  We all come from different places and different backgrounds.  We do not have to always agree, but we do need to remember that we are a brotherhood.  No opinion should be treated with disdain.  We can agree to disagree without being disrespectful.
<BR><BR>
6.  Never expect items to be bestowed upon you by someone in the guild.  Refrain from begging for items from other guildmates.  That is not to say that a higher level guildmate will not bestow items to those that they think are worthy.  Show your worth by your actions of honor, not by your words of greed.  If there is an item you wish to acquire, I am sure members of the guild will assist you in obtaining it.
<BR><BR>
7.  We will not powerlevel upon request.  Those classes that are desperately needed may be powerleveled at the guild leader's discretion.  Do not ask to be powerleveled.  However, powerleveling as a whole is frowned upon by this guild due to the lack of play experience due to this practice. 
<BR><BR>
8.  If you ask another guildmate to craft something for you using his tradeskills, you may not sell that item unless given permission from the crafter.  If you no longer need that item, please give it back to the crafter or to the guild bank.
<BR><BR>
9.  When grouping, make sure everyone knows the loot order and rules.  Do not steal loot that isn't yours.
<BR><BR>
10. Bringing a bad name upon our guild we have worked so hard to build will result in immediate termination. Questionable activities that may end up putting the guild in negative light (public ooc wars, spamming, casinos, etc) are not permitted.
<BR><BR>
Most of these guidelines are common sense rules that we all follow anyway and I'm sure very few members will go against them intentionally.  Just remember that as a member of DOD, you no longer just represent yourself, but all of us as well.  One bad act may tarnish a great guild's reputation.  Likewise, good deeds and acts of honor will take this guild far.
