    Amadorne is a sensitive soul, and consequently has to wear the full length 
    protective suit you can see in the photo, otherwise she melts. It's true! 
    The only part of her that's safe is the shoulders, and fortunately, the rest 
    can be disguised as an elegant ballgown - that's all very well, but it does 
    look rather out of place when she goes to the supermarket...</p>

    Frisky made a filthy joke about how if Devastator had a sacraficial dagger, 
    he'd have a much ruder surname. Personally, I reckon he's filth, and deserves 
    a good seeing to, er, dressing down, er, telling off. Frisky that is, not 
    Devastator. Well, Devastator may well be filth, but who am I to judge? Could 
    be a saint, although to be honest, I can't think of any saint who would choose 
    the name &quot;devastator&quot;.</p>

    Juul happens to be a &quot;grand mistress of fletching&quot;, which if you 
    ask me, sounds rude (mind you, most things sound rude to me). Apparently her 
    tanks love her, because she makes arrows while she meds. Aaah bless, nice 
    to be loved =) (not that I'd know, *sobs uncontrollably*, ahem, ok, finished

    send in a picture.&quot; Bearing in mind time difference between sending a 
    photo to me, and posting, add about 20 levels to that =). Perhaps taking so 
    long wasn't such a good idea given the really rather scary photo and homepage 
    Kataryna has. Um, Frisky, you stay here, and talk to the nice lady, I'll be,

    Tyreck says this: &quot;Hey there fellow Norrathians! My name is Heath and 
    I've been in "their world" since Beta 4. The screen shot of Tyreck, my 12th 
    level Halfling Druid on The Rathe server, is one of my many characters. Hey, 
    Desmaria Angelheart, any time you wanna go hunting...my time is your time! 
    If anyone wants to check out my site which includes EQ material, the address 
    is <a href="http://www.geocities.com/southbeach/bluffs/8217">http://www.geocities.com/southbeach/bluffs/8217</a>&quot; 
    Ahem, this isn't a dating service you know, you have to pay for that ;-). 
    However, given that you've been playing since Beta4, that explains why you 
    have no clothes in your photo - never enough a) time and b) money to go buy 
    some :-)<br>
    (NOTE - this is just Tyreck's profile carried over from The Rathe) </p>

    Ah, a man after my own heart... Mean and tough image only slightly spoiled

    Wendi says: &quot;You take one step I take two, you move forward and I move 
    back, You look around and I attack!&quot; Ooh! Hang on, thinking about that, 
    if they've taken one step forward, and you've taken two steps backwards, by 
    the time you've attacked them, they've turned round again - there goes your 
    element of stealth! I recommend clubbing them on the head with a stick - always 
    worked for me (but then, I'm a terrible rogue...)<br>

    Wentil is a &quot;Founding member of The Order of the Crystal Blade; Inrepid 
    explorer of Norath, and collector of all things mysterious, and magical.&quot; 
    Ooooooh! If I collected everything mysterious in Norrath, I'm sure I'd need 
    many more backpacks than I have - there's why those brownies roast everyone 
    who comes near, there's why I fell through the world that time in east karanas, 
    er, why on earth there are only 3 poison merchants in the whole world....
