    &quot;People have been demanding a photo from me, so here it is :) I'm a high-elf 
    enchanter on Bristlebane and I have a Taco fetish. I like hunting frogs and 
    monkeys and chickens. My friends are the greatest, even though they won't 
    stop pulling on my tail :/ My name is actually *not* a reference to that Mummy 
    movie, though many people have pointed out the similarity-- It's an Indonesian 
    word meaning "Child of the Preacher" or, as I like to translate it, "Child 
    of the Prophet." If you search for the concealed meaning behind my name, you'll 
    probably just end up with a headache... So take it at face value :)&quot; 
    Well, at face value it just means &quot;something rather hard to spell correctly 
    twice&quot; and with the provided translation I just get the phrase &quot;the 
    only one who could ever reach me/was the son of a preacher man&quot; stuck 
    in my head. *smiles vapidly*</p>

    Aaldiana says, &quot;I have found myself enjoying the game of EverQuest immensly...not 
    because of the game itself, though it is fun, but because of the wonderful 
    people I have met playing the game. I can proudly say that some of my best 
    friends, and even my current real life love interest, are people I have met 
    through EverQuest.&quot; Aw bless :-). Keeps you away from those dodgy police 
    fetish balls though.. ;-) (joke, joke!) </p>

    Group hug! The group is represented by Alail, who says, &quot;Ok, we plucked 
    up enough courage to send in our photos. hahaha This one happens to come from 
    our recent trip to New Orleans on Halloween. So ask yourself...Do these guys 
    and gal dress like this all the time? Well, I won't tell. hehehe We are just 
    a group of EQ addicts who like having fun. Chas St'Vitus is the leader of 
    the Evermore Guild and also very friendly and powerful warrior. Alail and 
    Tavia are THE dynamic duo in Norrath and are usually always seen together 
    traveling the world. Sangoma is a recent addition to the evercrack family 
    who vowed never to play.&quot; You evil people! Addicting your friends to

    Amariah says &quot;I have 2 chars, both female, called Amariah and Tiberia. 
    Amariah is a fun loving lass with big pointy ears who roams the lands of Norrath 
    with her oddly named pets and is a member of the Unseen University guild [the 
    finest guild in the world! *plug* -ed]. Tiberia lives up north in the climes 
    of Evefrost and wears a polar bear on her head and carries a huge Midnight 
    Mallet to twat things with! She hangs around a lot with Iceberg the Polar 
    Bear 'cos he is the cutest thing in EQ! In real life I design computer games 
    at Argonaut Software and spend most of my life playing EQ dammit - the most 
    addictive game ever in the world! Apart from pooter games, I love animals 
    especially cats, oh and Rolf Harris is the coolest!! :)&quot; Plus she's in 
    my guild, hooray! Also added her druid in, which she plays because she wants 
    to look like a cute wolf... Cute?! have you seen their eyes?! Blinking rabid 
    if you ask me.....</p>

    if you fancy it. On a slightly more bizarre note, Arusa describes himself 
    as &quot;european&quot; (someone has to...), given that he was born in Germany, 
    lives in Switzerland, and has a French fianc&#233;! I'd be too confused just

    or write) and can't talk normal and don't roleplay. This is false cuz Barktooth 
    and Bilodar just talk like pirates. I always have room to group as long as 
    we can hunt or travel and not "pull", "camp the 8 hr. rare spawn", or "kite" 
    cuz those arent as fun as hunting and traveling.&quot; About his non EQ and

    It's super-info time! &quot;In game persona: I pretty much just solo most 
    of the time. Grouping can be a hassle sometimes. If I'm gonna get killed, 
    I'm gonna do it myself. Heh heh. I'm still a good guy to group up with though. 
    Don't get me wrong. Give me a hollar. I'm usually around the Freeport areas 
    late at nights. Personal stuff: I live in New Jersey right across the George 
    Washington Bridge from NYC. If you care to know, I am an artist. I'm into 
    sports, music, and anything fun really. And that isn't the most complimenting 
    picture of me, but I just wanted you all to know that I personally went to 
    the Smithsonian to train with Yoda. Yes, he's the real puppet from the movies. 
    Email me and we'll talk (not about Star Wars though, please).&quot; Hey man,

    &quot;Vasco is an agnostic warrior who spends most of his time fighting in 
    the Qeynos Hills. If you see Vasco, stop and say HI. I also started a new 
    character (Dunkan) a Paladin of Tunare. I work for Qwest Commmunications as 
    a Technical Engineer in Columbus, Ohio. Thats about it, see you on Everquest.&quot;

    Vladimirr says &quot;hail a giant bat. oops! (hits ESC key) Hail. I play (gasps) 
    an Erudite Paladin! Why, you ask? Well, there's the obvious INT level. I can 
    debate ssues of philosophy with the mages in my group, while the other tanks 
    just stand there scratching their heads (or other places, if they are ogres). 
    And plus the fact that we just look SO COOL in any kind of armor! (ignores 
    the snide comments about banded) Oh yeah, and the lame looking pic of the 
    white guy is me. Hold your judgements, it was taken after a 10 hour EQ session.&quot; 
    OOh, I'll hold your judgement sir, know what I mean - suits you, OOH! *ahem*</p>

    <font size="3">Vven says that his photo is him feeling the after-effects of 
    a day trooping in the great Canadian Wilderness, poor baby. Apparently his 
    main everquest goal is to be known as "Vven the Ultimate Warrior!!!". Not 
    without some warrior fixes ;-)</font></font></font> </p>
