  <p>The following photos have been submitted from those playing on the Cazic 
    Thule server.<br>

    ICQ - &quot;do an icq search for Sinadilye&quot;<br>
    Sinadilye is apparently &quot;a Classical Guitarist, and a damn good one at 
    that. :P ...The first picture is one of her professional ones for performances. 
    The second is with Soapy, the obsessive-compulsive ferret.&quot; Insert rude 
    comment about playing with long furry warm things here... (ahem).</p>

    Franlfoter is guildmaster for the guild &quot;Shadows of the Flame&quot; and 
    apparently also goes as the &quot;Lost Drunk Ranger&quot; by his guild members. 
    I can imagine the guild outings now - &quot;what we going to do today, guildmaster?&quot; 
    - &quot;wee'rrre goinn' to th'pub&quot;. Actually, sounds pretty excellent 
    - sign me up!</p>

    <font size="3">Sent in by Creatar, below (he's the one with the scanner...) 
    these are of the &quot;Baron of Weapon Masters&quot; for the Sacred</font> 
    Silver Blades. You'll note that, not only is he looking very scary, he's also 
    looking very scary...<br>
    <br>
    <font size="4" color="#cc0000">Creatar</font><font size="4"> - Half Elf Ranger

    <font size="3">Creatar is the boyfriend of Brynn below (it's for you-hooooo! 
    ho ho ho, er, oh, ahem), and you can see her again in photo number 1! The 
    second is him with his lovely daughter Sophia, aaaaaaaaaah, bless 'em. If 
    I wasn't such a cynical old git, I'd probably go all girly.<br>
    Updated! More pics </font>sent in - photos of him just skatin' around (flash 
    git ;-) ) - note Brynn in the background of photo4...<br>

  <p><font size="4" color="#cc0000">Arakkas</font><font size="4"> - High Elf Wizard

    </a><br>
    <font size="3">Another one of the gang! Arakkas is in the Sacred Silver Blades, 
    and is friends with Brynn, Creatar, Cormik, and Ceine (aaah). Slightly wierd 
    in that the screenshot isn't actually of him, just of all his friends :-). 
    And yes, it's another flash git who can use photoshop when I can't (mutter).

    This is Brynn</font> when she's not staring at a computer screen, photo1 she 
    describes as the ever loving her in full spirit, and photo2 is the party girl 
    her! And now to confuse the Americans among you, Brynn Brynn, it's for you-hoooo! 
    (the management would like to apologise for the immensely poor quality of 
    this joke, and would like to add that alas, this type of humour is likely 
    to occur at worryingly regular intervals.)<font size="1"><br>
    <font size="3">Updated! Added a screenshot for Brynn, and also her dark elf 
    wizard + screenshot. Tada!<br>

    e-mail - <a href="mailto:Schweet_Tiger@prodigy.net">Schweet_Tiger@prodigy.net</a><br>
    <font size="3">Ceine is a member of the Sacred Silver Blades along with Brynn 
    and Creatar. Well, honestly, they could have mentioned it... er, actually, 
    they might have done, er, oh, never mind...</font><br>
    <br>
    <font size="4" color="#cc0000">Xatheus Daemonspire</font><font size="4"> -

    e-mail - <a href="mailto:silver@powersurfr.com">silver@powersurfr.com</a><br>
    <font size="3">Xatheus is a loyal member in the Hand of Chaos, and describes 
    his photo as this: "Searching for motivation at work..... after an all nighter 
    of EQ". Work? what's that? oh, that wierd thing that goes on between everquest 
    sessions, I don't pay much attention to it, to be honest...</font><br>

    <font size="4" color="#cc0000">Wynter</font><font size="4"> - Tier'Dal Necromancer 
    - <a href="wynter.jpg">PHOTO1</a> - <a href="wynter2.jpg">PHOTO2</a></font><font size="3"><br>
    e-mail - <a href="mailto:wilc@mediaone.net%20">wilc@mediaone.net </a><br>
    Wynter explains his photos like this: &quot;I have two screenshots. The first, 
    a normal night of EverQuest. The second, is me saying "SWEET, BABY!" after 
    myself and a companion found the Runed Bone Fork for the first time!&quot; 
    nice! I bet you ran off with it too... (grin).</font></p>

    e-mail - <a href="mailto:widdowsson@earthlink.net%20">widdowsson@earthlink.net 
    </a><br>
    <font size="3">Vastad has loads to say! Here it is: &quot;My name is Vastad 
    and I'm a EQ'aholic. I love the game dearly and although all the cheasy linear 
    restrictive rules like lore items, no drop, etc gets me ready to toss my monitor 
    at Brad. I still manage to enjoy my time as a Erudite (hey we match) Enchanter 
    on Cazic-Thule.Oh Philly Rocks BTW, lots of EQplayers out here.&quot; Ooh, 
    anger problems there, take a chill pill, baby. Tell you what, you buy me the 
    ticket, and I'll be more than happy to visit Philly, s'only about a thousand 
    pounds, what are you waiting for?</font><br>

    <font size="4" color="#cc0000">Lillayen</font><font size="4"> - High Elf Wizard

    e-mail - <a href="mailto:mikesizemore@hotmail.com">mikesizemore@hotmail.com</a><br>
    <font size="3">Lillayen actually scares me quite a bit. As well as including 
    the phrase &quot;Kill em all and let god sort them out&quot; in his mail, 
    he also appears in his photo to be wearing combat gear, and wielding a rifle. 
    Err, does anyone have a problem with this? No? Just me?</font><br>

    <font size="3">Angelwing says this: &quot;I'm a freshmen at A&M University 
    studying for bookeeping (pic number 3) but spend most of my time shopping 
    or just having fun. I don't play EQ as much as many but I get around =).&quot; 
    Shopping instead of Everquest?! What is she thinking of? She should be sitting, 
    slackjawed, killing yet another orc in the name of another level, never stopping, 
    never quitting, playing on and on and on, and.... oh, ahem, I do apologise, 
    I must get some sleep in the near future.</font></p>
