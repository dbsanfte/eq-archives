    bit... lol the only person I know here from RZ is Willowness (RL Cutie I might

    Goofing off, yeah, I dig. &quot;Sure I'm camping your bind point, but relax,

    Tyreck says this: &quot;Hey there fellow Norrathians! My name is Heath and 
    I've been in "their world" since Beta 4. The screen shot of Tyreck, my 12th 
    level Halfling Druid on The Rathe server, is one of my many characters. Hey, 
    Desmaria Angelheart, any time you wanna go hunting...my time is your time! 
    If anyone wants to check out my site which includes EQ material, the address 
    is <a href="http://www.geocities.com/southbeach/bluffs/8217">http://www.geocities.com/southbeach/bluffs/8217</a>&quot; 
    Ahem, this isn't a dating service you know, you have to pay for that ;-). 
    However, given that you've been playing since Beta4, that explains why you 
    have no clothes in your photo - never enough a) time and b) money to go buy 
    some :-) <br>
    (NOTE: this is just Tyreck's profile brought over from The Rathe, he's level 
    43 on RZ though :-) ). Oops, found another e-mail - more info on Tyreck - 
    &quot;This is my level 46 Druid Azzrael <dark carnival> on Rallos Zek who 
    is one naughty bastard. I usually solo unless a group gets the notion to go 
    do something cool like visit the Plane of Fear. I enjoy helping others and 
    often hand out over 100plat or powerful weapons like Shaped Darkwood Compound 
    Bows to lucky folks who I feel would benefit from such a gift. I never give 
    money to beggars.&quot; Which just goes to show, I should read my e-mails 
    more thoroughly... sigh</p>

    I should caption his picture with this - &quot;Tashurthan, pronounced (Ta-shure-thin), 
    is a Friendly Dark Elf Mage that resides on the Rallos Zek server. He helps 
    newbies when they are getting mauled by Young Kodies or bashed by Lesser Mummies 
    in Nektulos Forest. He has saved many lives, and with the help of his pet, 
    killed many evil ones.&quot; Well, that's all very well, but how are you supposed 
    to pronounce those brackets?</font></p>

    Now Thadish has a small amount to say, which I've printed on the Bertoxx page, 
    so you'll have to pop over there to see it :-). Mind you, it's not <i>that</i> 
    inspiring, although you may take pity on the poor soul *grin* </p>

    Zenwen says &quot;This is at my school's christmas banquet, I'm the one on 
    the left :)&quot; Not that Zenwen still has a little colour in his cheeks, 
    hence proving that this is a pre-everquest photo :-)<br>
