    Now I have to admit, I'm very impressed - each character has its own homepage! 
    That's addiction for ya =) Er, dedication I mean, ahem. Seen here is a rare 
    photo of Aslasa actually <i>outside</i> *gasp* and not an everquest screen 
    in site, shocker...<br>
    Update! er, before I even published the first mail. I painstakingly added 
    two other characters, thinking Frisky had missed them, then I read the other 
    mail, which said only add Aslasa, because I'm not playing the other characters, 
    and quite frankly I'm going off to sulk, cos it's all just too much *mumble 
    mutter* </p>

    Some of you might recall Baskaul as the level-impaired Seauniey from Mith 
    Marr. Well he's run out on them (quitter!) and started afresh! He says &quot;I 
    finally have hardware that can keep up! I am now playing a Barbarian Shaman, 
    named Baskaul, on The Tribunal. He just picked up level 8 this morning. I 
    am attaching an interesting pic him. He seems to be quite a tank.....for a 
    Shaman. You can find him near Halas; but as of recent he has been spening 
    some time in North Qeynos and Qeynos Hills.&quot; Note, this was sent a way 
    back, so add a few levels :-)</p>

    Hooray! First entry for the newest server in the land (that is, as I write 
    this it is...). Hoodlim says this - &quot;Picture of me, firing upon those 
    silver wheels of steel. An american dj spinning the likes of uk house and 
    some good ol' american breakbeat. Ok, because of my love for music, I probably 
    would have been better suited playing a bard. The moment a bard get a pair 
    of tech. 12's, I will be the first on it!! :)&quot; Oh, I can see it now - 
    the scene, a deserted Blackburrow (ok, not all that realistic), a nervous 
    group stands uneasily in the room known familiarly as &quot;the train station&quot;. 
    &quot;TRAIN TO THE BRIDGE!&quot; comes the panicked cry - the group experiences 
    a brown trousers moment as 4 elites and 7 patrolling gnomes steam towards 
    them. &quot;No problem!&quot; cries Hoodlim, who promptly whips out his decks, 
    slams on a couple of records, and starts mixing. All the gnolls stop and start 
    doing it doggy-style (Dancing! filthy person), everyone has a booze up, makes 
    friends, falls over a lot, and wakes up the next morning thinking &quot;what 
    <i>was</i> I drinking last night?&quot;. It would certainly break the monotony 
    a little bit.... </p>

    <s>Not just a human paladin, but a human paladin extraodinaire! Valreth is 
    also another Tindi'Losi guildmember, lucky him. This is all very impressive, 
    however, why does Valreth look so shifty in this photo? It's being taken by 
    his mum on his first day of college - aaaaah, bless 'im ;-) <br>
    </s>Updated! Valen has moved wholesale to The Tribunal server! He says &quot;Lamentably, 
    I do not have an updated photo of myself that doesn't make me look like either 
    a thug or a homicidal maniac....&quot; That's ok, we like you just the way 
    you are, a thuggish homicidal maniac....</font>

    &quot;Hey there everyone.. I am Yummi.. aka.. Gummi, Tummi, and Tasty by my 
    friends on the server. If you are ever looking for me on the game, you can 
    most likely find me in SK or LR killing bad little birdies, or in Blackburrow 
    killing little gnolls. If I am not in either of those places, chances are 
    I am off somewhere working on the Stien of Moggok quest to make some money. 
    IF you ever are on EQ and I am not there, chances are I am in class, @ UGA, 
    in one of my Drama classes, or I am at work where I am a oart time model for 
    a local agency. Happy gaming&quot;
