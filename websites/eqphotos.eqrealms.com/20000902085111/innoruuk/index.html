    Arllan says, &quot;I'm a Gemology student in florida. As of right now i just 
    work as a lapidary..for those guys looking that up..you don't have girlfriends 
    do you? I'm a jeweler i make custom cut stones and mountings for gemstones. 
    I'm new to EQ but been playing games like it for a long time...second nature 
    to me. Probably not the place to post it but ..interested in finding a guild..once 
    i get a bit stronger that is..drop me an email if you happen to be looking 
    for new members..&quot; Ooooh, cor, a jeweler! Great, I'll have 2 platinum 
    black pearl rings, and, and, and, what? *whisper*. Bugger, real life. Bastards.</p>

    <font size="3">If you look closely, you might find Bleidd in a slightly younger 
    pose elsewhere on this page, needless to say, my lips are sealed :-). Bleidd 
    is a member of the lovely Iceni (which always reminds me of Jawas going &quot;uuteeeni&quot;, 
    but that's just me), and, er, um, oooh, I've just been told that the Iceni 
    were a real celtic (or thereabouts) tribe, there you go! You learn a new thing 
    every day! I'm so excited, I think I'll, er, have a cup of tea, because that's 
    the kind of exciting person I am...</font></font></p>

    Yep, it's another terse guy in a t-shirt. What's my motivation here? Hello?</p>

    DLMezem says &quot;I run around quite a bit as a Gnome as well, he's a much 
    better dancer ;) Spending much of my time shark fishing in Qey catacombs. 
    You just tie the gnome to the end of a rope....... ;) You can drop me a line 
    if ya like. The e-mail address is derived my fighting style. Flash 'em then 
    Hack 'em up ;) Good hunting.&quot; Tie the Gnome to the end of a rope..... 
    sounds rude if you ask me (which you didn't, but let's face it, you're reading 
    it, so you don't have much choice :-) ).</p>

    Some kind of ogre or troll, judging by the name. No-one ever names their ogres 
    or trolls &quot;Princess&quot; or &quot;Fairysparkle Lala&quot;.</p>
  <p><font size="4" color="#cc0000">Grimfold Stoneshield</font><font size="4">

    <font size="3">Grimfold likes nothing better in his spare time than riding 
    his Katana 750 motorcycle (apparently), and snowboarding during the winter. 
    Snowboarding dwarfs - whatever next! Ballet-dancing ogres?</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" color="#cc0000">Gronzal So`Jhin</font><font size="4"> - Dark

    e-mail - <a href="mailto:gnageren@hotmail.com%20">gnageren@hotmail.com </a><br>
    <font size="3">Gronzal is 22 and from Norway and is shown here hacking people 
    to pieces in real life! Well, ok, so it's live roleplay, but I bet he twinked 
    that chainmail vest, yer. (Note to pharmacist, Mr Passion needs his eq iv 
    drip dose increasing by another 20 ml, thank you)</font>.<br>
    Updated! Gronzal added 2 more photos! Not only does he like playing evil, 
    but he also hand crafted his chainmail vest! Not bad, but which trader sold 
    him the manual?</p>

    Izuare is an enchantress &quot;who specialises in being totally incompetent....&quot; 
    and I'm apparently to endorse you to go to her webpage and spend lots of money 
    on quality animations from the mouse of a master, er, mistress.. (I made that 
    bit up, but if you can't plug for your friends, what can you do? ;-) ).</p>

    Mysteriously, Jobin appears to have utilised a store security camera for his 
    photo, whether he was employed by, or was just robbing the store, we'll never 
    know...</font></font></font></p>

    <font size="3">Kanyon would like me to add the following caption: "Who's better 
    then Kanyon?" "Nobody!" "The almight derv slayer in the flesh". Sir, it is 
    done! And it appears from the photo that someone's discovered the wonders 
    of photoshop filters...</font></p>

    Kuppy says &quot;Yes I play a female character to get a little help from time 
    to time from strangers :)&quot; - SHOCKING! I'm appalled, honest (cough), 
    is that why you're looking so scared in your photo? ;-)</p>

    Morro has provided us with a &quot;best of&quot; of webcam shots. Glory in

    Raan is shown here with his army of (one) adoring fan ;-), he says &quot;I 
    am Raan Lionheart, officer of the Shadow Dawn guild on the Innoruk server. 
    I love role-playing my Paladin because that is what I am like in real life.&quot; 
    plus he says it in really big bold script, so it must be true....</p>

    <font size="3">Lady Shayye Mawr has apparently been a member of the BurningHeart 
    Guild for several years now, which is nice, although I wonder if in the photo, 
    she's noticed that there appears to be something stuck to her hand... don't 
    worry, if you give it a good wash with swarfega, it'll probably come off with 
    time.</font></font></font> <br>
    Updated! Shayye says &quot;I am no longer with BurningHeart since it fell 
    apart :-( sad day .... and also just go by Shayye now since i lost mine rp 
    husband too...... yeah RP life sucks at times too i guess * grins *&quot; 
    Bummer! Still, new homepage, so at least the spare time goes to good use =)</p>

    </font>Slaena says, &quot;The photos were taken in Texas at a renaissance 
    fair near my home. I am the admin. manager for a risk engineering/consulting 
    firm (which isn't as impressive as it sounds and is more stressful than it 
    has any right to be). I am 23 years old, I consume books at an astonishing 
    rate, and my boyfriend is a chemist who has more recipes for scary stuff than 
    I care to think about (thank goodness he loves me *chuckles*).&quot; Hmmn, 
    boyfriend eh? Funny, cos I keep getting these mails from people on Innoruuk 
    asking when your photos will be posted *ahem* =].<font size="4"><br>

    study the art, others use the art, but only a precious few...become the art." 
    He also says he's a &quot;felwithian wizard&quot;, what, a high elf? That's 
    one twisted high elf fella!</font><br>
