    I could play forever. :)&quot; What, forever? But, like, you'd get hungry, 
    and probably bored, and what about the people on the flights? and Wulfrede 
    - he'd miss you - you know, I really think you haven't thought this one through...<br>

    off! I must say, working in the film business is perfect for my EQ addiction: 
    Either I'm working and too busy to even think about EQ, or I'm not working 
    and can play for days on end. "May Marr watch over your souls" &quot;. Now

    deep brown eyes and rather form-fitting ringmail). Wish I could string the 
    bow more often than I do, but always have those essays to grade. (Still working 
    on some way to combine the two activities.) If you see me, I'll probably be

    ICQ#: 12063797 <br>
    Seauniey says &quot;I know... lvl6 [read level 50, ahem -ed] looks weak compared 
    to some of the other that I have seen playing, but then again, it's hard to 
    get into a game that is as good as EQ when you didn't have hardware fast enough 
    to get into it!!! Hoep to see some of y'all out there!&quot;. Ah, we can spot 
    the man who's shortly about to acquire a credit card bill of gargantuan proportions 
    =) <br>
    Updated! He's moved to Tribunal - QUITTER!</p>

    &quot;I am a student and have been playing Everquest for one year. Now that 
    summer is here I can't wait to level up quicker since there will be more time.&quot; 
    Ah yes, summer, the perfect season for kiting.</p>

    Apparently this is the &quot;old&quot; version of Simtai on Rodcet. He gives 
    all sorts of exciting info, but hey, he doesn't play on this server, so why 
    am I bothering telling you!? *sigh* </p>

    <font size=3>What is it with these dark elves! They're so shy of the personal

    Traxion says, &quot;This is Gabe Hooper the person behind Traxion Dreadcraft 
    of Mithaniel Marr server. Wizard of of the 37th level and his wizard familiar 
    Candy. Traxion is a member of Fleur de Lance and thinks that his pet could 
    take Frisky Mittens any day!&quot; Why that's fighting talk! Frisky? &quot;Frisky 
    would probably win. In fact, Giant Rats are about the only thing that clerics 
    can successfully melee.&quot; She's so self effacing :-)</p>

    Uinr explains that the photo is him showing his friends just how little sleep 
    he got the night before (although he hastily adds this was due to playing 
    EQ, therefore ruining my punchline).<br>
    Updated! Uinr has sent in a new photo, and would like me to add the following 
    - Photo1 = before EQ, Photo2 = after EQ - I am, as ever, your humble servant!</font></font></font></font></p>

    Utnayan says of himself: &quot;I sell computers and accessories for a living 
    - and also workout for the most part and party it up with friends... I love 
    playing EQ on Sundays as I am mostly comatose anyhow :) I cut out a couple 
    people in the 2nd photo - but yea - I am bombed.&quot; Hooray for bombedness!</p>
