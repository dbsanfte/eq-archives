    includes a little character bio: &quot;Grimulf is a true champion of Kaladim, 
    he is sent to fight against all evil powers that stand against the dwarven 
    empire and to watch over he´s kin. Grimulf is still young yet he feels the 
    powers grow inside him and will one day become a legend of his race.&quot; 
    His real life hobbies are &quot;soccer , downhill moutainbiking. drinking 
    beer, movies , computergames&quot; Oh yeah? Lazy kids! In our day, we rode 
    our bikes uphill! Both ways! While drinking *formaldehyde*! <font size="2">Yeah,

    over now, nothing to see here..</font></p>
