    Updated! Dharla has sent in a squillion new screenshots and a new (equally

    I have to be gratuitously nice to Leonidas, not only for forgetting about 
    him, but also for telling him that he'd been updated, when actually, er, he 
    hadn't, ahem. So this lovely, kind, handsome and wonderful fella says, &quot;The 
    photograph was taken at college a while ago. Unlike most photos in the gallery, 
    I'm not doing anything special or sitting in a sports car or showing off warrior 
    muscles. I'm just, well - there. Then there's a screenshot of me when I was 
    around level 20 or so back in April or May 1999 standing with my coolest buddy 
    Asilia Da'Shae, and then a screenshot taken not two weeks ago (as a level 
    36), of me sitting with my very close EQ friend, Alindria Fairlight. That's 
    all I have to say 'bout that.&quot;. Wise words, from a sensational person.....

    Yes, they are the ones from the EverQuest cover art. I met them in real life! 
    They exist!!! The screenshot is of me in the Qeynos sewers hanging out with 
    Drosco. He is really a nice guy once you get to know him. The other thing 
    I want to mention is about my rubicite greaves. Why does every female wood 
    elf I meet in the game want to get me out of these pants? Apparently some 
    male ones too, but I won't go there.&quot; You should take those ladies to 
    meet your nice friend Drosco - I'm sure they'd get on fine! Just before they
