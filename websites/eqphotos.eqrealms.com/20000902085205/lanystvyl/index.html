    &quot;I'm an old school college mudder trying my hand at my first char, so 
    far so good, and rangers by far are my fave class to play. (tho haven't played 
    any others ;) )&quot; Which is sort of like a person eating nothing but microwave 
    ramen and calling it their favorite asian dish, er, not that I'm knocking 
    *cough*tanklikeawetpapersack*cough* rangers or anything. I'm sure he means 
    that they're fun to roleplay, (ie &quot;Hello, I am selling these fine 'pine 
    tree' air fresheners, sniff my bony chest for a sample!&quot;) and my vicious 
    powergamer attitude is just getting in the way.</p>

    In Faltine's own words, &quot;Besides spending my free time running for my 
    corpse in EQ, I also enjoy practicing martial-arts, yelling for help from 
    behind you, music, running for my corpse, a good hockey game, yelling for 
    help from in front of you, and oh yeah, I almost forgot...running for my corpse.&quot; 
    Looks like someone needs some jboots and a good map of Beholder.</p>

    Woo! first entry, I'm so excited, my heart almost, er, speeded up a little 
    bit, but then didn't since that would involve effort.... Hooka says &quot;I 
    have two main characters and a tradesman. Hooka is a lvl 16 dwarf [as of this 
    post -ed] and is the guy with me in the picture. I also play Keldren, a lvl 
    10 druid and Mystikforge, who doesn't get out of the city much but is slowly 
    becoming an able smithe and tailor. The picture of Hooka and I is a bit blury... 
    I'll try to send a better one of myself in the future. Like when i get off 
    my butt and buy a camera for my computer!&quot; I don't have that problem 
    - I do, however, have the problem of making it actually work *noises of smashing 
    cameras from the background*</p>

    Frisky, you are evil :-). Combined nicely into cheesy photosets, we present 
    Jakk B'Nimble in all his glory. Why, he's not a man, he's a <i>superman!</i> 
    He windsurfs, he plays basketball, he stands around half naked, he runs, he 
    cares for trees, he shaves his head... He says, &quot;As for me in real life, 
    I am 27 year old Radiology Technologist in the Navy stationed in Naples, Italy. 
    My hobbies include playing EQ, Volleyball, Track and Field (picture taken 
    before I started shaving my head), Football, Rock Climbing, Kneeboarding and 
    Martial Arts. My own homepage is www.heathalvarez.com which includes a gazillion 
    pictures and too much meaningless inforamtion pertaining to myself.&quot; 
    - do you need an excuse?! Send the man money for goodness sakes, he's a star!</p>

    Krayzon says, &quot;Formerly of RZ, Prexus, TZ, Tribunal, and Nameless. I 
    just can't find a server to stay on. Hopefully this will be the one. There's 
    alot of nice people to group up with. However, a special hello goes out to 
    Adiana Warbringer. I think we don't see enough of each other =). Oh yeah, 
    besides being a biologist, you can see my other profession in my pic.... SUPERMAN!&quot; 
    Wow, impressive. <i>HEY</i> lardarse! No wonder there are so many disasters 
    in the world, get off yer butt, stop playing EQ and start stopping catastrophes! 
    Slacker! </p>
