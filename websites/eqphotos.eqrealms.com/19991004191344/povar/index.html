  <p>The following photos have been submitted from those playing on the Povar 
    server.<br>

    </font><font size="3">Soliel's name apparently means &quot;Sun of Hatred&quot;, 
    ooh, nice fella then? He spoils this mean 'n' nasty aura however, by adding 
    this comment: &quot;A fun word I like to say is "mucus." Go ahead, try it. 
    Mucus, mucus, mucus. See, I told you.&quot; Sigh, after all that good work 
    with the build up...</font> <br>
    Updated! Soliel has added a bevy of information! He is one of three leaders 
    of Via Cruxae (currently the one with the guild leader bit), and he is also 
    an admin of the rather excellent <a href="http://con.xrgaming.net">Crossroads 
    of Norrath</a> site. He also says the following - &quot;I'm showing off my 
    new toy, the Staff of Writhing (no Necromancer should be without), which I 
    got by trading a Jeweled Skull (affectionately known as Mr. Hat) for. Now 
    I need to get my new newbie robe (Oracle Robe) since this one is getting old. 
    I enjoy smacking the living snot out of the McMannus Family in West Kanara, 
    as well as issuing commands to my new pet Spectre.&quot; Cor, what a showoff. 
    Particularly notice the &quot;Hit by non-melee for 140 damage&quot; in screenshot3, 
    sheesh.</p>

    <font size="3">A solitary comment: &quot;Earl spends his time chasing around 
    the tall pretty high elf females =)&quot;</font> Ooh! filthy boy! Outrageous! 
    I could never approve, at least, not when anyone was watching...<br>

    ICQ - 14363947<br>
    Khelor is apparently a half-elf and proud! Well, someone has to be.... (grin), 
    and besides, if you check out his photo, it will quickly become clear that 
    quite frankly, he's not all there ;-)</p>
  <p><font size="4" color="#cc0000">Juxrut</font><font size="4"> - Troll Shaman

    e-mail - <a href="mailto:cereal@terranova.net%20">cereal@terranova.net </a><br>
    <font size="3">Juxrut descibes himself as &quot;The terror of the swamps&quot;!, 
    ooh! Excitement! Not only that, but his photo shows him being adored by two 
    willing and nubile female slaves! double ooh with ice cream on top! And in 
    a lovely story of heartwarming tenderness, Juxrut is a real life friend of 
    Popedo, and (gasp), he found him again using this photo board! I've got a 
    warm glowy feeling all over...</font> </p>

    <FONT SIZE=3>Popedo describes himself as the "Glowing Blackened Gnome of Clan 
    Unterpahnz", and is apparently the highest level Gnomish warrior on Povar

    <FONT SIZE=3>Taneril has given me a webcam shot, explaining the bizarre angle, 
    and hastens to add that he doesn't normally wear a goatee, having been on 
    leave from the US air force at the time. Everquest penetrates the military! 
    Next, the world!</font></font></font></p>
