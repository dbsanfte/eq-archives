    &quot;My life these days (as you can see from the pics) consists of raising 
    Audie, my first baby, playing in my rock band Old 97's, and of course, playing 
    Everquest :-). If anyone is an Old 97 fan please send me a tell and say "Hi" 
    and tell me how you got into this crazy game. I'll hook you up with tickets 
    next time we are at your town. And to anyone else the Sow's are always free 
    :-).... &quot;</p>

    Another military type sucked into EQ. Perhaps the government is using it as 
    a training simulation in case we ever have to go to war with the gnolls.</p>

    Aaaaah bless, an everquest couple =). Now something worries me about these 
    photos - note the smile on Dahilia's face, and the slightly crazed expression 
    on Coronas's. Now I'm not one to spread rumours, but if you need help, send 
    out 3 clear flashes on a torch tonight, you got it? We'll be in there like 
    a flash.<br>

    more time for it....welp thats it....keep on eq'ing...&quot; Hah! you're not 
    fooling me, come on, spit it out, how much did you pay those other guys to 
    pose with you? We all know that as soon as the photo was taken, you dropped 
    the cardboard guitar and sprinted back to the pc... &quot;I'm on a 26 hour

    Femina is what is known as a giving person - &quot;Her heart belongs to Corvalis, 
    her faith to Karana and the fury of her blade to the Emerald Warriors&quot;. 
    Which is all very well, but I hope they give it back. Otherwise she's gonna 
    look pretty silly when that train of goblins comes to get her....</p>

    Hawkfist says &quot;Hawkfist is a loner who delivers a lot of mail between 
    Qeynos, West Karana, Surefall Glade, and Halas -- mostly as it gives him cash, 
    and an excuse to slaughter gnoll guardians of Black Burrow. Hawkfist holds 
    grudges, and has developed overriding hateds for the Soloist, Composer, and 
    Lyracist skeletons which inhabit Everfrost 0 he leaves the diary pages for 
    those on the quest, though. Always willing to act as &quot;designated target&quot; 
    for group adventures, he is somewhat heedless of personal danger -- after 
    all, he has a bank account in Qeynos...&quot; Which is all very well, but 
    hopelessly out of date given how long I've taken (ulp, sorry). Still now he 
    can probably go back and stomp all over everything that killed him then, so 
    that's ok =)</p>

    Jihanna says, &quot;Hi there! My name is Holly and I just started playing. 
    My husband has been playing for a while...One heck of a marriage counselor, 
    let me tell you. I didn't understand. I have always been into roleplaying, 
    but not really into the video games like Diablo, etc. I finally sat down the 
    other night and stated playing EQ. Now we play together. It's great!! &quot; 
    Aw, sweet :-). Mind you, it's the first time I've ever heard of EQ saving 
    a marriage, usually it breaks them up... </p>

    Has anyone else ever wondered why the rangers wear that skin-tight Christmas 
    tree motif? no? just me then... Ahem, anyway, Kataryn says this: &quot;In 
    real life, (ugh) I'm in the Army as a Helicopter Crewchief. When not flying 
    or in the field, I'm protecting Tunare's children and searching out important 
    relics, such as the Eye of Stormhammer. If only I could find some easy way 
    to kill Slaythe.......&quot; Take to the skies, flyboy!<br>
    Updated! &quot;Photo is me and my daughter on vacation to Korea, screenshot 
    is a Quasi-recent one of Kat, now a member of Lions Denizens...I'm easy to 
    spot, I'm usually the one with 3 to 10 mobs behind me and guildmates running 
    in front of me =)&quot;</p>

    Kindolin says that he's &quot;the dwarf Snow White doesn't want you to know 
    about&quot;, (probably because his name didn't fit: grumpy; sleepy, doc, and 
    kindolin, nah, can't see it ). He says &quot;The reason for so many characters 
    is that I am an officer in the "Keepers of the Fiery Myste" guild and I bring 
    in one of my characters that is around the same lvl as a pledge so that I 
    can see if they work well with others ( I have no life) The cool thing about 
    being an officer is that I am traveling to see guild members.. England is 
    in the spring... &quot; Which is nice, but I'm not sure of the relevance of 
    England... (but hey, who cares, if I'm allowed to ramble on, then so is everyone 
    else...). You can also feel free to E him, whatever that means, although I'm 
    sure it's not supply him with illegal rave drugs...</p>

    a face to the face as it were. I'm a Lev 22 High Elf Mage. I also have a Necro, 
    Enchanter, Druid and Shamen. Maybe I will bump into you sometime. Always happy

    appliance. Hm, actually, I'd buy one of those. Heh heh.&quot; You female chauvenist, 
    er, pig, um, or something, never mind.. Martigan says &quot;Here is a three-and-a-half 
    year old picture of me and my two girls at Disneyland. They are now 10 and 
    7...and I'm the big 30! Yikes! My wife plays too and is a lvl 26 Wood Elf

    when you can; it comes back around, you know.&quot; Sure can! And they can

    I split Neener's big photo into the 4 smaller ones to make it more digestable 
    for you, you see how nice I am, and the things I do for you? why do I bother, 
    sheesh ;-). Apparently she has her old name from a text-based mud on it (ah, 
    those were the days), so where it says &quot;Shiva&quot;, you'll have to imagine 
    it saying &quot;Neener&quot;, got it? Not too difficult for you all? Good, 
    now go away and practice it, and come back when you're at skill 150...</p>

    that way people who know the names Nepz DeVir and Linky DeVir could associate 
    a name with a face. Basically I enjoy running around backstabbing or buffing 
    whatever comes my way, I try to help out newbies whenever posible and try 
    to almost always keep in RP mode.. welp, Now that a troll like myself has 
    had the courage to send in a pic, I sugest the rest of you do the same ;)&quot;

    Raspen can be seen &quot;flying about everywhere trying to seek out female

    grouped with a female counterpart&quot; I expect his piercing green eyes are 
    especially tuned to see the exhaust plumes of female counterparts who are 
    also, erm, flying about... er... But to go on, once Raspen finds this counterpart, 
    &quot;umm.. interesting.. conversations&quot; will occur, and ladies choice 
    as to whether drinking or destruction of everything in their paths shall ensue.
