    Wow! Two photos in one day! The excitment is practically overwhelming! Jonarra 
    used to play on Xegony as Tellwyn, and Solusek Ro as Broosr, but I couldn't 
    be bothered to put them in, because I'm lazy :-). Jonarra says &quot;With 
    4 teenagers I'm realizing that jumping around onstage is a sport for the young. 
    I've recently retreated to the solitude of the test server--big change from 
    the chaos of the live servers. When you meet someone it's unusual!&quot;. 
    Hmmn, I think I might go there, make a change from Greater Shout-dark ;-)

    Hooray! Our first test server player! Aurelia says she loves it there, despite 
    its ups and downs ;-). Aurelia &quot;is currently Lvl 15 and can most frequently 
    be found running between Qeynos to train and Oasis with hunting stops at various 
    places inbetween. If anyone is looking for help and I am able I am most willing 
    to lend a hand. :)&quot;. Whereas Sunarai is &quot;of Lvl 5 and when I play 
    her of late I prefer to hunt in the ButcherBlock Mountain area. Although she 
    can't do much I'm also willing to lend a hand with her. :) &quot;. So there 
    you go! Aurelia also says that &quot;the second photo is the most precious 
    reason that if you play with me you may find my game play very interrupted. 
    :)&quot; Easy solution to that, get 2 more computers, make them age about 
    10 years, and hook them up ;-)
