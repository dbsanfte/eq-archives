    ICQ# - 1512386<br>
    Ok, first Nameless entry, and boy is it gonna go on =) Freem &quot;enjoys 
    wandering around helping new arrivals, summoning stuf just to see the pretty 
    lights and not taking it seriously when some annoying beastie shaman-type 
    thwacks him with a spell! A real loner&quot;. On the other hand, Squawker 
    is &quot;gregarious and fun-loving, can often be found fishing at the port 
    with his cleric buddy. Regularly falls in the water due to alcohol abuse and 
    escapes dowing by the skin of his (brown, cracked) teeth!&quot;. Hmmn, old 
    ICQ number (he says &quot;OLD user, hee hee!&quot;, to which Frisky says &quot;4I 
    have an ICQ number lower than his. Nyaahhh. Amazingly enough, though, most 
    people I talk to have lower numbers than I do. It's some kind of geek synergy.&quot; 
    hey you! back to your oar, did I give you permission to speak?! ahem). Real 
    life Freem describes himself as &quot;Writer of reviews, lover of animals 
    (but not in *that* way), spender of money, payer of debts... :o)&quot;. Visit 
    his page for Stars!, Warlords III, Xpace and Malkari! (insert &quot;ah, those 
    were the days&quot; here.....)</p>
