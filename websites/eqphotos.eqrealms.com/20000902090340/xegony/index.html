    &quot;I'm a free spirit who goes wherever the wind takes me...But most of 
    the time you'll find me in the Dreadlands. I've grown rather fond of hunting

    I love these stream of consciousness-type things - &quot;Althea is a greek 
    name, which I am in real life. most of my chars will always have a greek name 
    because of this. In the game I am a member of Raven Clan. Most people seem 
    to enjoy grouping with me cause I am fun and humorous player. Death...it does 
    not become me....although I attract it&quot; Hey, why don't you become a necromancer, 
    then all this attraction of death will be useful for you :-)</font><br>
    Updated! Althea has a last name and a lovely picture of her doing that druid 
    flame-fist thing that the druids do.. yes, more of the usual comments about 
    the prudence of having fiery hands while you're going about planting trees 
    and cuddling fuzzy woodland creatures can go here.</p>

    &quot;A wizard of no little ablity, I just always seem to be on the wrong 
    end of someone's sword. Seriously, I first played EQ when it was still in 
    Beta on my bestfriend's computer. I hated it. Then as I watched him play, 
    I liked it. Now I have my own account and am as addicted as everyone else.&quot;

    fun and, above all, be kind to one another.", "Wait, I am lost!&quot;.&quot; 
    Amazing isn't it, the two classes that get track both get lost more than anyother 
    - miscellaneousranger tells the group, &quot;hang on, I'll track you&quot; 
    - ten minutes later - &quot;er, I'm lost, where are you?&quot;. You'd never 
    catch me wandering through Butcherblock mountains for 3/4 of an hour at level

    which is wierd for a paladin, but you got to appreciate how nice he looks

    1 whatever in rubicite just to get on people's nerves, bwahahahaha! On the

    with human paladins calling themselves &quot;Drool&quot;, you never know.

    Now I could rant and rave here about the fact that Ibierno hasn't given me

    A joint effort here! Jenikat is played by two people, the main one of which 
    is pictured here (Rosalyn, should you care to know...). Apparently, she levels 
    her, and he sells banded armour, which is nice :-) (p.s. I am reliably informed 
    it is an old screenshot, so you have to be impressed, and then multiply it 
    a couple of times, ok?).</font> <br>
    Updated! Jenikat has added a more recent screenshot, and quite a change it 
    is! Not least because of that humungous object she's got in her hand! Look 
    at the size of it! Phwoar! It's a wonder her wrist can take it! Try wielding 
    that in an enclosed space, how on earth does she fit <i>that</i> in her pocket...

    (known mudanely as Lyra of Seattle) is your average Spirt-o-Wolf casting little 
    druidess. Oh, yes.. there're those nasty habits of her's too -- something 
    about having a rather mmm.. loud mouth and the inability to refuse the buffing 
    requests of anyone nearby, especially fellow members of the guild she belongs 
    to, Asa-Tru. Quick to flirt and even quicker to cast Levitate upon her unsuspecting 
    victims, Katiah is an easy-going person both in and out of game. Nevermind 
    the vampy look in the photograph.. that was an 'evil twin' day. Er. Yeah. 
    Screenshots are of Kat in the Gorge of King Whatsizface and frolicking in 
    her more 'naturual' form in the deceptively lovely forest of Lesser Faydark

    of Paul Nobacon from the band Chumbawumba. Wow, a real pop star playing everquest, 
    surely not?! Well, in fact that's right, surely not, guess Transistor is too 
    shy to send in a real photo :-). This is what he says - &quot;here is a beautiful 
    pic of the evil Dark Elf Shadow Knight they call Transistor. I got the name 
    Transistor from the smash hit song of the coolest band ever, 311!! He's only 
    a lvl 12 [level 12?! in bronze and rubicite?! hmmn, methinks he's a bit higher 
    in this screenshot - ed] but is growing fast!! I am a part of the Black Rose 
    Society and love to slay human guards (regardless of the horrible faction)!! 
    In any rpg i love to be something evil. It makes it so much more interesting!! 
    I love to duel and everyone's invited to give it their pitiful try to destroy 
    me, but fail, anytime!! Just remember.....it's your funeral!! Gotta go play 
    some eq. peace out&quot; So there you go... <br>
    Updated! Added a new screenshot! Looking (if possible) even more sinister 
    and scary! Bah - you don't scare me, you think you scare me? Oh, ok, you do

    Updated! What fashion is Virile modelling this spring? Exactly the question 
    which has been on all our minds! Here we see her in a lovely pastel suit of

    take tons of screenshots of yourself.</p>
