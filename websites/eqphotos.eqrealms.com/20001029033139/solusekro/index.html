    Soooo, I wonder which one plays the more Everquest :-). Surely not Alkie? 
    This photo was apparently taken &quot;on our recent trip to the UK. Guinness 
    is GOD!&quot; Really? I thought it was a drink, which just goes to show, I 
    don't go down the pub enough. Taxi! </p>

    Almighty is a member of the Order of the Crimson Hands (too much jam on their 
    toast), and as we can see from his photo, lives an unhappy existence in a 
    small 2' by 4' box, with EQ as his only release... *sigh* oh, the humanity!</p>

    it in the family and all that. Except the marriage, obviously. You don't want

    Right, hmmn. Shailak has given me quite the HUGEST amount of info I've ever

    and live now in Virginia USA. Traveling is my passion, but who has the time? 
    A lot of my real life friends play EverQuest, and that lets us spend time 
    together, even so we are living on different coast's.&quot;, then she says 
    this &quot;When I don't attend court hearings, monitor compliance's, or track 
    down people that don't want to be found, I am on my PC. Also I enjoy creating 
    mosaic art, my Dog (a German Shepherd), anything old (Books, History, Museums) 
    and great conversation with my friends over some excellent wine and good food. 
    My Family is very international, we represent about 6 different Countries, 
    there is always someone visiting, and a lot of action.&quot; oo-er! Ah what 
    the hell, let's have it all, cos then she says this &quot;As to role-play 
    and Fantasy, I have always loved to indulge in fairy tales, and such. As a 
    child growing up, I attended a Boarding school in Germany, that was actually 
    an old castle/monestary, build accommodate the troops of the king, in-between 
    battles. Lots of history there, and room for fantasy. I miss the old country, 
    and go back every chance I get.&quot; Talk about a full life, I feel really 
    boring now! (that would be because I am mind you, but there's no need to point 
    it out ;-) ). </p>
