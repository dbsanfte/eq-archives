    I'm guessing that this is Benzon's name, since he didn't tell me (it's on 
    his e-mail, as you can see....), but what the hell, he's really quite impressively 
    juggling 3 flaming torches, and apparently has a photo of him juggling seven 
    balls, which sounds rude, especially considering that they are obscuring his 
    face in the photo, which is why he didn't send it in...(ahem, I'm so sorry, 
    long day, you know how it is...)<br>
    Updated - Ammadayu is the man formerly known as Benzon. Here he is juggling 
    more things.. &quot;One is on me juggling 9 balls and one is of me juggling 
    8 rings. (i'm sorry to say I juggle more than I play EQ, because I am practicing 
    for the world competition in Montreal in August. hehe)&quot;</p>

    As Frisky so ably points out, it's another raceless ranger.... (snare, shoot, 
    snare, shoot, ahem) We find ourselves wondering (well, ok, Frisky did, and 
    I'm gonna pretend to, just to seem as if I'm still the funny one) whether 
    he's married to Alfafemale...<br>
    Er, curses, that comment no longer makes sense. As <i>Alair</i> explains: 
    &quot;i just replied to let you know that the ever vigilant GMs of everquest 
    have deigned that Alfamale was not a proper character name for the eq environment, 
    (apparently, Bitchkilla IS), anyway, my raceless ranger's new character name 
    is Alair&quot;. The swines! Why I oughta... didn't you tell them it'd ruin 
    my ever so witty comment?!</p>

    Frisky says: &quot;More Champions of Norrath [Go CoN! ;-p - ed]. The ranger 
    seems to have left his wee ranger knives somewhere in Crushbone, and is just 
    mad enough to slap those naughty orcs silly! At least that's what the place 
    looks like. What do you think? I guess it could be Unrest, too. In that case 
    replace &quot;orcs&quot; with &quot;zombies&quot;. If you want to. You wouldn't 
    want to make me look all presumptuous, would you, thinking I could tell you 
    the zone in one look? I still think it looks like the entrance to Crushbone. 
    Yeah. And no I don't have anything against wood elves, I just think they look 
    like a bunch of doe-eyed surfers with &quot;Christmas Tree&quot; air fresheners 
    all over their clothes. I have plenty of friends who are wood elves. Okay, 
    I used to. I guess I kind of got drunk and insulted them until they /ignored 
    me.&quot; Hmmn, whose idea was it to let him write these? What do you mean,

    rather grand, but since I got meditate, I got mana coming out of everywhere.. 
    *laugh*&quot; Beautiful Erudin? Have you ever been there? A more dull city 
    I have never seen, honestly. Mind you, since he seems to be finding it difficult 
    to fit his face in the camera frame, I expect he's a little short sighted

    Our friendly big-eared druid says &quot;Byler is, as her dear friend Issa 
    has called her, a bit &quot;saucy&quot;. She enjoys adventuring to many different 
    places, and is quite the hyper little druid. She says away from Everfrost, 
    though, only because her military uniform is a bit &quot;lacking2. In RL, 
    she is a student of psychology and business, and chases three little rugrats 
    around most of the day!&quot; As Frisky says, chasing rugrats around is a 
    lot like chasing giant rats around. I hope she doesn't pull off their ears 
    and sell them for copper though. On the other hand, it'd certainly stop them 
    whinging &quot;mum, I don't like cabbage&quot; *RIIIP* &quot;more cabbage

    but gave him the freedom to select his own surname. He's been on hiatus for 
    a bit, but may return to the ranks of the actives at some point soon. His 
    trusted allies, Felron and Sareliel Swiftstryke (of Champions of Norrath fame) 
    and Korrg Dawngreeter are never far behind when Norlef is around. He frequents 
    Permafrost - a place that traumatized him in his youth, but thanks to the 
    efforts of Bearjangles of MFH, didn't lead to corpse loss.&quot;<br>
    &quot;Aymen Tadat, Dwarven Cleric - This appropriately named cleric has been 
    rising through the ranks quickly, and making a name for himself by frequently 
    buffing all those around him. Look for him in Permafrost, bringing the word 
    of Brell Serillis to the goblins there.&quot; Formerlysuperkev. Superb surname,

    I do some artwork and portraits and here's my EQ art site.<a href="http://members.tripod.com/%7Eumberman/eq/uber.htm"> 
    http://members.tripod.com/~umberman/eq/uber.htm</a> I am one huge EQ addict 
    and i've been playing since the end of beta. Hope people like the little bit 
    of art work i did with the portraits.&quot; Very nice - a disciple of the 
    &quot;floaty-head&quot; school of art I see....</p>

    Voxx says &quot;Because people fear what they cannot understand I am scorned 
    and disdained from normal society. That is ok, because I know that I am just 
    like all the rest of you...I just happen to wear my dark side on my sleeve.&quot; 
    Look, there's no need to justify it - you like to hang around with dead people 
    - that's not a problem, just don't bring them round for tea, ok?</p>

    His name means &quot;Protector of Life&quot; in serbian latin. Which of course 
    you recognized immediately. Right? Anyways, he's level 42 at the time of writing 
    and a proud member of the guild Clan Icewind. <br>
    *ahem* There was also another photo of him here, but that was just hastily 
    deleted, cos it turns out he never sent it in the first place... *whistle*<br>
    Steve plays Big Brother and re-writes history, hmm?<br>

    Aaargh! These people who know how to use Photoshop properly! I'm seething 
    with jealousy! I'd write a vicious review, and truly put him in his place, 
    but, but, I can't! It looks too nice! Bastard! <br>
