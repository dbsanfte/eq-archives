    a lovable one. Many people love me. I used to make lots of money in pottery, 
    until the costs were jacked up. Life is depressing.... I love to make jewellery 
    too and many people love me because I heal everybody everywhere I go. My name 
    is known in Felwithe, Kelethin, Crushbone, Butcherblock, Greater Faydark and 
    I am working on Unrest, Befallen, and Freeport.&quot; </font> No problems 
    with the ego there then ;-) Oh, and it's a painting, btw, in case you think 
    she's a REALLY bizarre looking lady (grin)</p>

    Shagswell?! uh huh. Ariane says, &quot;I would like people to seek me out 
    to hunt with. I got on Everquest about 6 months after all of my friends soooo 
    that means that they are level 35-50 and don't have much time for a lowly 
    ranger. This means that although I have many people to give me advice, I am 
    playing this game pretty much alone :( Thanks again - please feel free to 
    e-mail me - am a flight attendant and travel a lot (so that means I'm traveling 
    alone in reality too). Kiss.&quot; That's a bit forward innit?! I barely know 
    you! :-). Still, I'm sure there are plenty out there willing to oblige you, 
    the selfless perverts that they are ;-)</p>

    Hmmn .... She says &quot;Hobbies- Rock Climbing, Scuba, Dirt Bikes, Fishing, 
    Skiing and on and on and on OH yes EQ. Personal Quote---- I hope I die like 
    my grandfather, peacefully and in my sleep rather than screaming like the

    Bloodrose conveniently writes a little biography about herself : &quot;she's 
    presently engaged to Vanguin Quelvelguk (yummy dark elf rogue boi... gotta 
    love those bois in black! <grins evilly>) who will take her surname in the 
    wonderful drow way. bloodrose is well known throughout the lands of norrath 
    for tossing various race triscuits (eg dwarf triscuits, gnome triscuits, hummie 
    triscuits, etc) at the unsuspecting. her jewelcraft is 200 (finally... 5kpp 
    later :P) and she's presently working on baking (fire beetle pie! w00t!). 
    did i mention vanguin is yummy? <smirk>&quot; All her RL information may be 
    found on her website listed above, thank you and goodnight.</p>

    Caat is the girlfriend of Ikol above (apparently, her playing is all his fault...) 
    and on Ikol's recommendation, has sent in this photo. I'm desperately resisting

    Right, proper info for Chueh on this page =) He's a 20 year-old Caucasion 
    Male, height 6'1&quot;, Weight just under 150lb.(why am I telling you this?!). 
    Interesting, er, photo =) Apparently Mokujin's surname is subject to change 
    due to his &quot;engagement to Icefrost, a FEMALE High Elf Wizard&quot;. Well 
    If it were a bloke, I'd use the capitals, but that's overdoing it a bit, no?

    looking for a bind.&quot; Poor Eddie, the path of the unwilling pker is a 
    treacherous one. He also adds the following wise words &quot;I got EverQuest, 
    now I have no life&quot;. Pull back those curtains! see the sunshine for the
