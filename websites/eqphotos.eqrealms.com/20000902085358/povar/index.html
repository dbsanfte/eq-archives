    Annanas, apparently spurred on to post a photo by Drawmjil and his harem, 
    says: &quot; They say I'm the sweetest and cutest Barbarian Shaman in the 
    world of Norrath ;o) and I'm mentioned on Drawmjils pages too....oh, yes - 
    he is a RL friend. Who said Barbarians couldn't love Ogres?? Hehe...there 
    might be a wedding on Povar soon!&quot; Oh dear, 10 foot skirt-wearing children 
    with tusks..</p>
  <p><font size="4" color="#CC0000">Baibbas Bagginns</font><font size="4"> - Halfing

    e-mail - <a href="mailto:brynbeth@xmission.com">brynbeth@xmission.com</a><br>
    Baibbas is apparently &quot;a cocky, headstrong halfling from Rivervale who 
    lives up to the term "good things come in small packages". From the coldest 
    reaches of Everfrost Peaks to the rotten hell of Unrest, this little dude 
    has been everywhere. Wielding his trademark Langseax of the Wolves, Baibbas 
    is a formidable foe, while at the same time an irreplaceable ally to have 
    in battle. Baibbas swears allegiance to only a handful of players on Povar, 
    to include Replicantone, Tizleena, and Aakasha. Mohannas is a kind, helpful 
    high elf from Felwithe. In his fifth season, Mohannas actually made the run 
    without SOW from Felwithe all the way to Rivervale to be with Baibbas, to 
    include running through Kithicor woods in the dead of night. He then returned 
    to Felwithe in the same fashion and aggressively worked to move into his eleventh 
    season in the span of less than a week. Did I mention he was crazy? Mohannas 
    is currently on hiatus from adventuring to pursue religous exploration in 
    the Karanas. Look to see him back in action soon!&quot; so there you go.... 
    in real life he's a &quot;Captain in the Air Force, out of service in 30 days&quot;, 
    due to suffering from the distressing angular haircut condition ;-p </p>

    <a href="baulshot2.jpg">SCREENSHOT2</a> <br>
    </font>Apparently, &quot;Baul is hot-tempered, generous, somewhat reclusive, 
    kind-hearted, loves to be in the middle of the fray, hates clusterf__cked 
    combat and will always help out a friend.&quot; Pretty complicated for a troll 
    really. Most interactions with trolls that I have go along the lines of &quot;ME 
    EAT YU&quot; -no, I'm not edible- &quot;ME SMUSH YU&quot; -you could try, 
    but how about we kill this orc instead?- &quot;uh, ok, me frend now&quot;. 
    But hey, that's just me, innit =)</p>

    An ogre with HTML, scary concept. Waving his testerone about, he sent me the

    with pretty vomen on their photos, I, as a beautiful Ogre would of course

    e-mail -<a href="mailto:bplong@att.com"> bplong@att.com</a><br>
    Gilamorf says &quot;This RL photo was taken during my two week active duty 
    period with the US Navy. I helped deliver babies during hurricane Floyd ( 
    Yes, It's true!), and like my self my character is a healer...sort of. Gilamorf 
    Frosthammer is my character's name, and is a 22nd level shaman on the Povar 
    server. In RL I'm an IT administrator, but two weeks out of the year they 
    let me be a medic in the US Naval Reserves.&quot; Aw, what a sweetie, although 
    I can't see it happening in everquest - it's a baby boy! Quick, kill it, what 
    does it drop?<br>

    e-mail - <a href="mailto:merenpha@hotmail.com">merenpha@hotmail.com</a><br>
    Hapi says, &quot;Hapi is the eqyptian god/goddess of the nile. She is often 
    depicted in animal form as a hippo. On cavings she is depicted with male organ 
    and female breasts. Though Hapi is very much a man he acknowledges his feminine 
    sides - give me a tell and you will find a very gentle soul roaming the face 
    of Norath in the Povar dimension.&quot;. Well there you go, an informative 
    history lesson. Just one thing - what would a non-female breast be? ;-)</p>

    Illierd, who apparently lives around people who take pictures of him as he 
    heads to the shower, says: &quot;I'm a 16yr old student at a Military academy 
    (kinda wack) Also my character Illierd, a halfl cleric, who's currently lvl 
    22 soon to be 23, is in the same guild as Gilamorf, our current guild leader.&quot;

    ooh! Excitement! Not only that, but his photo shows him being adored by two 
    willing and nubile female slaves! double ooh with ice cream on top! And in 
    a lovely story of heartwarming tenderness, Juxrut is a real life friend of 
    Popedo, and (gasp), he found him again using this photo board! I've got a 
    warm glowy feeling all over...</font> </p>

    Khelor is apparently a half-elf and proud! Well, someone has to be.... (grin), 
    and besides, if you check out his photo, it will quickly become clear that 
    quite frankly, he's not all there ;-)</p>

    Absolutely my <i>favourite</i> photo of all time! Fantastic stuff :-). Foot 
    planted firmly on stump, Kring Wolfshadow stares into the distance - his manner 
    denoting majesty, grace, and style. &quot;back off, healer, I'm camping this 
    stump for my cleric twink&quot;. </p>

    e-mail - <a href="mailto:dakronack@yahoo.com">dakronack@yahoo.com</a><br>
    Kronack is a massive level 4! Well, he was when he sent this :-) I expect 
    he may have gained just a teeny few levels since then (which reminds me, I 
    must update my character pictures, how embarassing), he says he's &quot;, 
    a 4th (and climbing) Level Dwarf. Seemingly an expert now at finding my own 
    corpse rain or shine. If corpse littering was against the Everquest law I 
    would be in jail for a very very long time. I am the one in the middle with 
    the red "spear" &quot;. Aaaaaahhhh, the glorious moment we've all faced in 
    our eq lives where we suddenly realise we should press the &quot;enter&quot; 
    key before hitting A if we're gonna talk to our guildleader....<br>
    Updated! Kronack now says, &quot;Ok, so you can add 20 levels and a surname 
    to my stats. Who knows by the time this gets posted I might be 50th? hehehehe 
    [the cheek! -ed] Thanks really just kidding. New screenshot for ya except 
    now I be stylish in BL Mail and the rest be crafted.&quot; So there you go, 
    so much excitement, you might as well have a lie down for the rest of the 
    day. </p>

    Mohana says that she is &quot;friendly, and struggling to join the higher 
    ranks. See you on there!&quot;. Well strictly speaking, you won't, due to 
    the fact that I don't play on Povar... oh, right, you meant <i>them</i> *gestures

    Mucus, mucus, mucus. See, I told you.&quot; Sigh, after all that good work 
    with the build up...</font> <br>
    Updated! Soliel has added a bevy of information! He is one of three leaders 
    of Via Cruxae (currently the one with the guild leader bit), and he is also 
    an admin of the rather excellent <a href="http://con.xrgaming.net">Crossroads 
    of Norrath</a> site. He also says the following - &quot;I'm showing off my 
    new toy, the Staff of Writhing (no Necromancer should be without), which I 
    got by trading a Jeweled Skull (affectionately known as Mr. Hat) for. Now 
    I need to get my new newbie robe (Oracle Robe) since this one is getting old. 
    I enjoy smacking the living snot out of the McMannus Family in West Kanara, 
    as well as issuing commands to my new pet Spectre.&quot; Cor, what a showoff.
