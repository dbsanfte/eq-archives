    &quot;I am a member of one of the newest guilds on Luclin "Norrath's Justice" 
    where we are all dedicated to helping out so if you see one of us just give 
    a yell we will help if we can.&quot;</p>

    Barrakuda says: &quot;Do on to others, what others do on to you. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!&quot; 
    I think he means &quot;unto&quot; as not many people do things &quot;on&quot; 
    you, unless you're into that sort of thing. That sort of &quot;doing on&quot; 
    thing. No, I don't know what I'm talking about.</p>

    &quot;I have the rather unique honour of being a guild member of the 'Elven 
    Council of Life'. (The stick on pointy ears fooled their reqruitment officer 
    :) Anyway the RL photo of me is either a day out rowing OR me wielding the 
    DeepWater Harpoon - close call. I 'Hail' from England but have travelled widely 
    around the this planet (any offers of trips around others eagerly sought - 
    give tell). Lookforward to seeing you all in Norrath, till then happy travels,
