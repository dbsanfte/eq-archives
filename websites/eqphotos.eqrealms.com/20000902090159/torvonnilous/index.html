    &quot;Hey hello everyone... cant be all to hard to figure out what my hobbies 
    are from looking at my pic (in RL and on EQ).. you can most likely find me 
    in any local pub, enjoying my favorite past time, when i am not playing EQ 
    you can most likely find me in any bar on the strip enjoying my favorite past 
    time, but most of the times, you can find me on EQ enjoying my favorite past 
    times while I am enjoying it in real life also. Hope to see you all soon. 
    and if i do see you, the next drink is on me &quot;</p>
