    &quot;HellooooooOOOooOOoooo, I am a Officer from the best Guild on Saryrn 
    named: Fyrelake Guardians. On Veeshan I was Raoul Sagunto from the Orders 
    of the Vigilant Hand and I had 7 Chars more... By this way I want to say hello 
    to all Veeshan ppl who switched to Saryrn! /wave&quot;</p>

    Garbhad is a member of Blood Reign and &quot;quite possibly the most dead 
    sexy enchanter on the face of Norrath. No ladies i am taken. Only one druid 
    has my attention. She knows who she is. May the gods smile on you..&quot;<br>

    "In 17 years of playing RPGs (I started AD&D at age 12) and online games, 
    this was the first time I ever thought to play a female. I felt it a challenge, 
    and it has been both that and hillarious. I want to say I loved my friends 
    on Bristlebane, and carry that spirit still on Saryrn. Familjen forever, and 
    Tunare bless all your souls!" </p>

    &quot;Nuuko is a member of the Fyrelake Elves (short for Fyrelake Elven Association) 
    which is based on the Saryrn Server. The Fyrelake Elves started out on Rallos 
    Zek, then moved over to Bristlebane and has finally ended up on the Saryrn 
    Server. Nuuko has been a member of the Fleas (as they are called) for about 
    3 years, considering he has been in their companionship for as long. Nuuko 
    was first born on the desert world of Athas in Darksun Online as a member 
    of the Veiled Alliance and was featured weekly in the Tales of Tyrian Intrigue 
    Event/Storyline. He presently makes his homeland on Norrath alongside the 
    Fleas. Cheers&quot; </p>

    While these are most likely not actual pictures of the player behind Stroke, 
    I thought they were interesting enough to put up anyways. Stroke says: &quot;All 
    shall fall to their knees before the fury of STROKE. BLOOD REIGN&quot; I thought 
    it'd be the other way 'round, but I guess dwarves don't need to kneel. Yarr!</p>

    &quot;In my picture, I'm the guy in uniform on the left. Don't mind my cheesy 
    smile or squinty eyes please =) All Hail the Screaming Fist! Like Kosch, I 
    am a member of the Screaming Fist and enjoy hunting with guild members, the 
    only difference between our characters is I'm not a stiff Britt (j/k ;) ) 
    Strangely enough, by looking at Kaymara e-mail addy...I am not related to 
    her, nor did I steal my characters last name from Fantasy's e-mail addy ;)&quot; 
    Eluan is also not named after the cuban media darling of similar name. </p>

    "In the perfect battle, there would be 5 paladins and a shaman! for the paladins 
    need no one! they heal! they buff the melee! They rock! and so does Guardians 
    of Light" So they'd just have the shaman there to constantly point out how 
    unneeded they are? How cruel. </p>

    <font size="3">Fantasy ha</font>s the following message: &quot;Hello everyone 
    .. I hope that you are all finding things well in the world of Norrath&quot;. 
    Inspiring, I'm sure you all agree. However, she's given us a lovely poem on 
    her screenshot, so I suppose we might forgive her. (although I can't think 
    of any warriors I've met recently who have &quot;a voice of reason and sympathy&quot;, 
    to be honest...) ;-) Oh, apologies for the size of the screenshot, but I couldn't 
    resize it without ruining the text, soz.<br>
    Updated - Upon her move to Saryrn, Fantasy says &quot;Hello from Blood Reign&quot; 
    and &quot;I really think its a shame that we have to put our real life pictures 
    out here to prove that we are female! I guess from what they say in the statistics 
    is that over 80% of the female characters in this game are played by males. 
    But I dont think thats true I think us girls just dont speak out much :oP&quot;</p>

    Kosch, posing with the shy Zastil in the background, says breathlessly: &quot;All 
    Hail the Screaming Fist, The Darkness will fill the sky and upon that day, 
    the young shall know the ancient terror, Watch the shadows. Well that will 
    have to wait till an can Organise my guild, (The Divine Shadow). When I am 
    emperor I shall smite the Norrath plague (Gnolls,Orcs anything that looks 
    odd) with a mighty vengance, take the Light away and embrace the darkness. 
    Do you everwish you could find more time to play EQ? What I've got a family 
    who are they?&quot; Whatever you say.. I am being hypnotized by his teeth..</p>

    Zastil says he is a member of the Guardians of Light, and not much else. So 
    I'll just let everyone know that the guild title makes me think of someone 
    crouched desperately over a tiny lit candle, screaming, &quot;Oh no! I know 
    what you want! You covet my beloved LIGHT! ..I've had it since I was a small 
    child.. people.. always trying to take it from me! Why don't they just.. LEAVE! 
    ME! ALOOONNE!!!&quot; And that is my best Kricfalusi impression, thank you, 
    goodnight.<br>
