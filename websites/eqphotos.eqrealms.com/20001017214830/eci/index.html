    Agadnmenmon is supposed to be Agamemnon apparently (*cough*naming rules violation*cough*), 
    and hails from Los Angeles. He says &quot;Just like other Paly's I am poor, 
    most of my loot and extra stuff go to the newbies instead of the overpriced 
    stores, still trying to learn smithing, baking and all those other skills 
    that make the game more fun. Gives me something to do when the population 
    is low and the Orcs, Dervs and bad creatures are not around. Hope to get a 
    screenshot soon, can someone help?&quot; Take photos of this historical figure!

    A bit about Cycle, after I mention that I would have picked the last name 
    &quot;Mates&quot;.. but that's why he's out there and I'm in in a dark little 
    room with my face glued to a monitor, thinking that 70 days played doesn't 
    seem like such a long time: &quot;Anyways, here's my pic which was taken about 
    2 years ago, but I don't look much different; and some relevant info about 
    myself: I'm 24 years young and live in SF California. Character's name is 
    Cycle Cloudwynd and is a level 22 Erudite Mage of E'ci. I am a member of a 
    relatively new guild called Circle of Trust which boasts a modest 12 players

    Updated! Another hideously late update here (oops) - Darkpact says &quot;Darkpact

    now changed. That was too variable to maintain, and I don't have time. So

    have noticed, because he's still attached to the PC, he's also lead GM of

    Tassadar is level 50, and says, &quot;I have not lost 50 yet, unlike other 
    levels, 8 and 9 times, and I have even ventured to the Planes of Hate and 
    Fear, and helped slay Nagafen and Lady Vox, but when I go to the Airplane, 
    I am going in NAKED!!, I don't want to loose my stuff. I am not sure what 
    other players on Ec'i think of Tassadar, but I don't seem to be hated. I tend 
    to help the lower levels a lot, I never charge for teleports and I never Kill 
    Steal, and I have yielded to lower levels at camp spots. I HATE CAMPING!!! 
    Albert is 30, and wonders why he has quit this game twice and come back.&quot; 
    Aw, cos he's so nice, and has to spread his sweet lovin around :-). Also, 
    because his embarassing head mutation as seen in the photograph makes him 
    a laughing stock unless he's at a call-centre convention...</p>

    and started playing the game because it liked the idea of a 3d chatroom. Knight

    Webairn says &quot;This is me, Webarn Bladedancer of the rangers of Surfal 
    Glade. I am 17 and live in America. Webairn is 18th level so I don't have 
    my surname yet but this is the one I want. My dad plays too. He is Deyaja 
    Loremaster, a 20th level Erudian Wizard. In game he is my father also (that 
    is a long story I won't bore you with). Between school and my job I don't 
    have a lot of free time to play so I am not on as much as I used to be&quot;. 
    Apparently the photo is a little old, but it kind of looks like Webairn, and 
    it's one of her Dad's favourites =) To be honest, I haven't seen too many 
    rangers that look like Heidi, but then who am I to judge ;-p</p>
