    If you ain't using EQ to escape this mundane reality, you got to use any means 
    you have at your disposal! If that's booze, then so be it! (I would like to 
    add that the use of alcohol for recreation is at the owner's discretion, although 
    I would stress that not only is it fun, it also looks good and makes you more 
    attractive... ahem). <br>
    <font size="3">Updated! Added an extra picture - in his own words - &quot;I

    I enjoy dwarf tossing and moonlit walks along the beaches in between the trouncing 
    of sand giants and griffons. Turn-ons: Dark Elf females in leather with whips.

    use a time system based on the real world time system then people should be 
    able to be named after the months...oh well...Chonk is gone...Octobre is a 
    thing of the past...and November is renamed Alandir....</font>&quot;<br>

    with her accident-prone friend Barbaraeden. She's happy to help out newbies, 
    but is usually in need of help herself whether it's running from Sand Giants 
    or being ganged up on by just about anything under the sun! She also adds 
    some info on Bloodless on Quellious, which is too much for here, but suffice 
    to say, a large portion was about an erudite called &quot;Blacksilk&quot;,

    Nurse! Fetch the EQ IV drip, it's another case of pure addiction! &quot;This 
    is kindof neat, it is cool to see who all these people are. Everyquest is 
    the first true alternate reality on earth. It also happens to be more addictive 
    than crack cocaine, compared to reports ive heard. About me? In the rl, im 
    a 23 year old electrical and computer engineering student in missouri. I play 
    drums and ac. guitar, date whatever woman is up to it, and produce a call 
    in radio show on the local npr station(i love npr). In EQ, im Siddaq the enterprising
