    reach 20th level Kiztan and Klantyre will be married. I play only healers 
    but finally am devoted to playing Kiztan as my primary character.&quot;, he

    Hey, hey! Another member of the Voice of One.... Guess it's the voice of two 
    then. She says &quot;Klantyre is engaged to Kiztan the High Elf Cleric, and 
    they'll be getting married and getting last names when they hit level 20! 
    *cheesy grin* What to say about my picture...well, I think you can tell from 
    looking at it that I have an evil-streak in me, and that comes out in Klantyre 
    during battle when she suddenly reverts from sweet, loving, Erollisi Marr-worshipper 
    to blood-thirsty monster-choker! In fact, I'll send you one-such of those 
    screen-shots as well! (anyone else notice that their character resembles them 
    somewhat?) *more grinning*&quot; Well your character resembles a figure surrounded 
    by rather a lot of flames, but hey, who's counting :-p<br>
    Updated! Explained at last :-) Turns out she's actually an enchantress, and 
    sent me the wrong photo ... appropriate screenshot attached...</font></p>

    to go around dominating good if it's constantly dying and being destroyed!

    On a personal note: Both of us are single, and we are not brothers in real 
    life, we just work together surfing the web constructing our webpage for the 
    ultimate EQ resource page [see above -ed], We have an extream passion for 
    roleplaying, sometimes we can be caught offgaurd, but dont mistake our OOC 
    (out of charactor) for our IC (In Charactor) talking, we tend not to be OOC 
    at all, 90% of the time we are all in IC. We are proud members of <voice of one>. 
    We both despise people who try and talk IC and say thing such as "hey dood

    and now am working in maternity delivering babies, soon to finish school for

    My character is working diligently on my jewelery skill, if you should need 
    any please let me know (....) Ever need help let me know.&quot; 5 children, 
    maternity nurse, at school <i>and</i> EQ?! Can we say spare time?! Well, probably 
    not... <br>
    (Frisky complained vociferously about the photo, which wouldn't display in

    not particularly necessary to tell you, but an explanation is nice, and I
