    Apparently the photo is three years old, but that's how long his scanner has 
    been busted, and he can't be arsed to get it fixed :-). Shocking. Anyhooooooooo, 
    Adok is the fella, and Rosemary is the lady, as he says: &quot;As if a girl 
    would play a troll... no.. she has to play a gnome because they are 'cute' 
    d'oh! We're in the UK too (Red dragon forever!!) &quot; Indeed. Er, isn't

    Allinon was apparently Web Master for the guild of MoY when playing Drakkar

    tell them to add about 8 inches more hair length &lt;g&gt;&quot; Okay then, 
    there you are, though I'm sure some of them will want to shave it off while 
    you're sleeping, for getting that &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot; song stuck 
    in their heads. Paaarrsley, sage, rosemary and a big glass of shut the hell

    Frisky (our resident dark elf expert, erm..) comments: &quot;Geneveive belongs 
    to the guild Elg' Carresen, which she says is full of angry females. Not surprising 
    if they're all dark elven women who have gotten their first pair of nice patchwork 
    pants and are surprised to discover that one rather tender part has been left 
    unprotected.. She also says: &quot;I don't play eq as much as I want, the 
    damnable real world keeps jerking me back. And for some reason I find myself 
    attracted to large blue men with pointing ears...... no not the smurfs!!!&quot; 
    So for those young men who would like to impress her, I'm pleased to announce 
    a new EQPhotos service. We will elongate the ears of, and tint blue, the face 
    in your photo. Just make out a money order for $15 (US) to Frisky A. Mittens..&quot;

    This is Brynn</font> when she's not staring at a computer screen, photo1 she 
    describes as the ever loving her in full spirit, and photo2 is the party girl 
    her! And now to confuse the Americans among you, Brynn Brynn, it's for you-hoooo! 
    (the management would like to apologise for the immensely poor quality of 
    this joke, and would like to add that alas, this type of humour is likely 
    to occur at worryingly regular intervals.)<font size="1"><br>
    <font size="3">Updated! Added a screenshot for Brynn, and also her dark elf 
    wizard + screenshot. Tada!<br>
    Updated again! not-Brynn says &quot;Sadly brynn is no more, so i regretfully 
    ask that you take her pictures and screen caps down =( BUT!! on a happier 
    note i have made a new character, I ask that you repost this picture and screenshot 
    in Brynn's place, My new char is a High Elf, Enchantress, also on Cazic Thule. 
    Her name is Xign Dezire, hehe pronouned Zine. FYI thats me in the hat at Club 
    Utopia in Las Vegas.&quot; So there you go, or as Frisky says &quot;Arrrghh.. 
    I wish people wouldn't do confusing shit like this... *you* rewrite it. 8)&quot; 
    What do you mean, I wasn't supposed to actually put that on the site? *&lt;;-]</font></font><br>
