    When not leading the evil hordes of the Denizens of Darkness or baking little 
    high elf shaped cookies and biting their heads off, Chase (can I call you 
    Chase? Please? I'm too lazy to type the rest again) is: &quot;a painter (mostly 
    oils lately), I run a custom leather business (Crypt Leather) and try to raise 
    the kids (kitties) while playing several rpgs and fending off the covetous 
    fiance from the EverQuest chair...simultaneously.&quot;</p>

    Gillo says: &quot;Hello, my name is Marylou. My EQ friends Jerunell and Khenmyra 
    already have their pictures posted, so I figured I'd send a few in of myself 
    as well. The first picture is of me in 1987. I was bombed. The second is in 
    94 in Tijuana with my family. The donkey's name was Hidalgo. I was bombed 
    there too. The third picture is this past Christmas at my son Barry's house. 
    I may have been bombed by then. Anyway the screenshots are also from last 
    Christmas when I put on a play with my friend Teepo. We performed CATS, the 
    Tony award winning musical, at the Wintergarden Theater.&quot; Okay, I can 
    see you getting a druid and performing DOGS, but CATS?</p>

    to be a full real estate manager/investor, right now I'm more of a real estate

    &quot;Hello, my name is T. I am a recovering EverQuest addict. I played my 
    character, Jerunell M'Laine since the day EQ was released, on Fennin Ro, and 
    switched with my guild, The Order of the Divine Light, to Druzzil Ro when 
    it opened. Cookie!! Here I am rokking in my aunt's kitchen (yes that is a 
    real tattoo of Pac-Man), and here I am eating a brownie with pudding, ice 
    cream, and whipped cream. It was delicious. Here is Jerunell on top of a lizard's 
    head. He is a hotty. Here is a Michael Jackson Wan Knight. He is the rarest 
    of them all!!&quot; Yeah, I killed that once. He drops the Guise of the Eccentric, 
    DE only, effect: High Elf Illusion.</p>

    Khenmyra, formerly of Fennin Ro, sends a new epic and and three more photos.. 
    what do I look like, Geocities?! Anyways: &quot;In picture one, you can see 
    the real life me (known hereon as 'Corrie') strutting my stuff. (the jacket 
    was from my school's lost and found...don't ask.) #2 is of me in my ren garb... 
    I see all these dorks (ALL eq players are dorks, me included) in their renaissance 
    clothes... I hope I don't look as cheesy. My real life activities include: 
    Eating, Using the term 'y'all', Posing, Sleeping, Not doing my homework, wearing 
    clothes and staying in the house all the time. I fully intend on being either 
    Jessie from Team Rocket (Pokemon, people! do you ever get out?!) or Rogue 
    (as in the mutant, not the class) for halloween this year. You better believe 
    you'll be recieving a picture of that! In my everquest collage of sorts, you 
    can see the many faces (or..bodies...) of Khenmyra Elena'melar. My everquest 
    activities include: Tailoring, Baking, the /flipoff command, and getting my 
    ass kicked by a multitude of creatures. Haha...Jet sucks! You hear me, punk?! 
    I'll teach you to interfere with me!&quot; </p>
