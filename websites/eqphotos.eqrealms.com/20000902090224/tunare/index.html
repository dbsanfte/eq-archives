    They like to battle in Unrest. Yes, if I had a &quot;significant other&quot;, 
    there's nothing I'd rather do than spend time with them chopping the undead 
    into little bits while ghouls moan sweetly in the background. And we'd have 
    our honeymoon in a tiny cabin in the woods, reading the Necronomicon by a 
    crackling fire. Ahhhh.</p>

    Winstone has thoughtfully written up a lovely bio for himself, and here 'tis: 
    &quot;Let's be honest, being a warrior is the most basic thing you can be 
    on Everquest, and that's why I'm there! Once I decided to become a Barbarian 
    in the cold Halas region, I thoughtfully went out to the cold myself to acclimate 
    myself to the cold upper regions. (That and ski Deadman's Bluff - which I 
    unsuccessfully did right after this picture was taken.) My problem is that 
    my RL takes up 50 percent of my time, which is unacceptable in the Everquest 
    community. But I slosh on, and one day I will settle down with a cutie pie 
    and raise woolly mammoths in Everfrost.&quot; Ah yes, the mammoths. Everyone 
    loves to watch a nice mammoth race, but once you get into the business you 
    start making enemies, and one morning you wake up with Lil' Tuskie's 1 ton 
    severed head next to you on the pillow..</p>

    In her own words (thereby not risking another &quot;incident&quot; like with 
    Aerynea): &quot;Gwane is what I call the medicine woman of Tunare. If anybody 
    is in trouble, she will stop to help them, whether it be a heal or a buff 
    or what have you. Gwane is also married to one of the best warriors in tunare. 
    His name is Boston.&quot; And neither of them are scary in the slightest, 
    except when they're at the head of a train to the City of Mist zone.</p>

    Shanolar is &quot;your basic example of a "Save the Whales" type Druid. Even 

    though he isn't very strong ( Yet ), he can still pack quite a punch against 

    the Orcs he's learned to hate so much. Okay, now more about me...uhm...I like 

    anime ( Ah Megamisama being my personal favorite ), RPGs, and women. :) Heh. 

    Anyway. If you ever want to email me or IM me, feel free, if you ever wanna 

    see Shanolar, you better do a /who all shanolar, because I like to go wherever 

    the wind takes me.&quot; A nice thought, but damned inconvenient if the wind's 

    blowing out to sea and you haven't got a boat, hmmn? Bet you didn't think 

    of that one did you? HMMN?! NO! you never <i>think</i> about these things 

    do you young man?! Now go to your room and think about what you've learned 

    today... </p>

    Teppeny claims that she's a druid, but a bard at heart.. (!), and says, &quot;Teppeny 

    (or Teppie as she most the time calls herself) is basically a confused little 

    hobbit who's common tongue has been referred to 'sounding as if an Ogre taught 

    her to speak'. Teppie is a bit simple-minded, you could say and doesn't always 

    get what is said right when someone says it... Sounds a bit like your typical 

    blonde.. :P She's usually running around 'keeling' things, and has been known 

    to drink an EXTREME amount of caffiene... Keep on the look out for this Hobbit, 

    as she's been known to bite a traveler or two.. or three.. or.. five...&quot; 

    Cor, and you don't even have to pay - bonus!</p>

    I'm convinced there's a connection between real-life armourers and everquest 

    players ;-) - &quot; My character's name is Khalista she is a Human Cleric 

    on the Tunare server. Khalista likes to TRY to help people, although I can't 

    always get to an area where someone may need it, but I will try. I enjoy talking 

    to people on EQ, so I usually welcome tells. If anyone would like a mid-teen 

    lvl Cleric in their group I will be happy to join in if I am available. <br>

    As for me, I am 5 ft 1 1/2 in tall and my hair is 3 ft 6 in long (which I 

    am very proud of). 8Þ I am interested in medieval re-creation and renaissance 

    festivals. I also am in a small business that makes chainmail and leather 

    wear, both costume and armor. People are welcome to e-mail me at the contact 

    above for info on that.&quot; Lovely, now to business, the rate for advertising 

    here is as follows......<br>

    Updated! Added two URL's and a screenshot- enjoy! <br>

    Updated! ok ok ok. Er, this may or may not be the last update for Khalista, 

    not sure, I get a bit lost to be honest... She's now married to Vanion Al'Kabor 

    (of rune fame?) and is in a guild called the Jaded Flame (the flame that's 

    a bit bored? Can't be arsed any more? Shhh Steve), er, screenshots removed, 

    new one added, new webpage, ach, I've no idea, I need a lie down.</p>

    About his character, Salah says &quot;Salah is a crazy character. The first 

    to jump into battle, also the first to die for getting himself buried in deep 

    trouble real quick. He doesn't mind throwing himself in the way to help other 

    party members, but running to save his own ass is always a viable option. 

    It's a rough world out there. Gotta look out for number one. He also will 

    help out other parties if he is running solo, which is fairly often.&quot;. 

    I'm not sure if it's anything to do with him, but his e-mail signature was 

    ranting on and on about some gun or other, no idea what he's talking about

    her likes as &quot;Wearing a Bearhead; Curling up with a good book; Breaking 

    the skulls of my enemies and dancing upon them&quot;, and her dislikes as 

    &quot;Respawning at night; Certain kinds of cheeses; Trains; Having my skull 

    broken and danced upon&quot;. That's nice, I spot a conspiracy here, although 

    they have different e-mails, I suspect they may inhabit at least the same 

    office...</font></p>

  <P ALIGN=center><font size="4" color="#cc0000">Than Al'Hazred</font><font size="4">

    e-mail - <a href="mailto:kdeacon@home.com%20">kdeacon@home.com </a><br>

    <font size="3">Again, I'm left with not much info here. Well, ok, none at 

    all. So we'll instead have to look at Than's photo and admire his gleaming 

    locks as a substitute, lovely.</font> </p>

  <P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" size="4">Halaster <FONT COLOR="#000000">- 

    Wizard - <A HREF="halaster.jpg">PHOTO</A><br>

    <FONT SIZE="3">Halaster describes himself as an "Unsane Wizard", and adds 

    the following puzzling statement - "rebirth through fire". I see. From the 

    look of his photo, the poor dear's a little confused, there there.</font></font></font></p>

  <P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" size="4">Epitome <FONT COLOR="#000000">- 

    Dwarf Cleric - <A HREF="epitome.jpg">PHOTO</A><br>

    <font size="3">e-mail - <a href="whos_your_daddy@hotmail.com">whos_your_daddy@hotmail.com</a></font><BR>

    <FONT SIZE="3">Epitome states that other than being stocky, he does not look 

    like a dwarf, although he has the nose for it. And no, he is not stoned in 

    that picture (the thought!) He can be found outside Crushbone - heals and 

    buffs for all!</font></font></font></P>

  <P ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR="#cc0000" SIZE="4">Drakk Maelstrom<FONT COLOR="#000000">

    <font size="3">e-mail - <a href="mailto:ultraskot@mediaone.net%20">ultraskot@mediaone.net 

    </a></font> <BR>

    <FONT SIZE="3">Drakk adds these inspiring words to accompany his visage - 

    "I must retreat from real life into the Everquest world often, for I am shunned 

    by my peers for my unusual hobbies" - indeedly doodly!</font></font></font></p>



  <p align=center><font COLOR="#cc0000" size="4">Mandonnagon<font color="#000000">

    </a></font> <BR>

    <font size=3>Mandonnagon is shown here being all "at one with nature", I'm 

    sure he should have a druid. (grin).</font></font></font></p>



  <p align=center><font color="#cc0000" size="4">Tarne <font color="#000000">- 

    Dark Elf Warrior - <A HREF="tarne.jpg">PHOTO</a><br>

    <font size="3">Tarne, in typical Dark Elf style, is reserved in giving personal 

    details, so instead, we'll have to draw our own conclusions from his photo.	

    Too much everquest, not enough tidying? ;-)</font></font></font></p>
