            <p><b>Dwarven Warrior</b><br>
              By Brylden </p>
            <p>For starters let me tell you how I distributed the bonus points. 
              I put 20 in AGI and 5 into STR. So this brought my stats to:</p>
            <p>STR 105<br>
              STA 100<br>
              AGI 95<br>
              DEX 90<br>
              WIS 83<br>
              INT 60<br>
              CHA 45</p>
            <p><b>Levels 1 - 4</b><br>
              For level 1 I killed decaying skeletons, bats, snakes and goblin 
              welps. For level 2 I also started killing skunks and scarabs. That 
              is about all I did until level 3 where I went to the crossroads 
              and started killing more skunks and white large snakes and large 
              spiders. During this time you should try to get patchwork armor 
              and a rusty 1h slash and if you are lucky a rusty 2h sword. You 
              can also turn in 2 scarab carapices for the scarab helm. At level 
              4 you should be able to kill more large snakes and large spiders. 
              By the way, you should keep all spider silks because since the new 
              tailoring patch people buy the silks for 3-4gp each.</p>
            <p><b>Levels 5 - 8</b><br>
              At level 5 I grouped with a like level cleric and killed the skeletons 
              at the druid stones. I pretty much did this until I made level 9. 
              You should keep all bone fragments that you get for a quest that 
              you can do at the Paladin guild. At this time you can do some quests. 
              There is one real good one that I did quite a few times. It is the 
              Bull Smasher quest in Ak'Anon. I will let you discover the specifics 
              for the quest yourselves.</p>
            <p><b>Level 9 - 16</b><br>
              At level 9 I got on the boat and went to Freeport. The first thing 
              I did of course is get bound at the East Gate. Then I went to Oasis 
              with my Cleric friend and killed caimans. You can stay here till 
              about level 22 but I got bored and left at level 17. I have almost 
              full bronze, a Crafted Gauntlet, 2 Langseax, and a Brutechopper.<br>
              <b><br>
              Level 17- 21 (Present) </b><br>
              This is when you start being able to do many things. At 17 I went 
              to High Hold and killed orcs and gnolls. I got a Polished Granite 
              Tomahawk and sold it for 250pp well worth waiting for the spawn. 
              I stayed here for a while but decided to go explore the world. The 
              next place I went is Rathe Lake and killed the Aviak Guards outside 
              the Arena. When I hit level 18 we went to South Karana and killed 
              roaming aviaks until 19. At 19 we went the the Beholder Maze and 
              killed Gorge Minos and Evil Eyes. (just on a side note you are going 
              to have to find a decent sized group to start doing anything worth 
              while.) At level 20 I found myself at Mistmoore and this is where 
              I am going to stay for a couple more levels. I am currently level 
              21 and have Crafted Boots, Greaves, Gauntlets, and Bracer. The rest 
              is Bronze.<br>
