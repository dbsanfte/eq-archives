            <p><b>Bashing/Kicking</b><br>
              By Dextor Malthorn</p>
            <p>Many warriors find out early that Kicking does more damage than 
              the Slam/Bash skill. This is in fact true and many warriors never 
              give Slam/Bash a second thought. Wrong! Bad move! Permit me to explain.</p>
            <p>Kick is good when your in a straight knife fight with the exception 
              listed below.</p>
            <p>I used Slam ( A skill give to large races) and Bash interchangeably. 
              The only difference is that Slam does not take a shield and so can 
              be used with two handed weapons.</p>
            <p>The more commonly know use for Bash is to stun your opponent. I 
              use this frequently when my victim has decided to run. At 28th level 
              I stun about 50% of the time when I hit. The means my victim dies 
              before getting as far and to his reinforcements. (can you say TRAIN!)</p>
            <p>The less well known and by FAR better reason to keep your Bash 
              skill up is that when it hit it will Always(99%) interrupt a spell 
              while being cast. At high levels the caster spell can hurt us far 
              faster than some brute. Don't Kick or bash, just melee with the 
              caster. When you see him begin to cast...BASH! If you hit him before 
              he completes his casting his spell Will Be interrupted. With the 
              most aggressive casters you can prevent 50% of the spells from being 
              cast. This is because spell recover time is less than bash ecovery 
              time. Two warriors trading off bashes can stop 90% of the casts, 
              only failing when the bash misses. This can be a life saver in a 
              group and most people don't even realize what's happening.</p>
            <p>I always get a kick when I here someone say, &quot; Did they make 
              these guys easier?&quot; Happy Hunting.<br>
