            <p><b>Pottery</b><br>
              By <a href="mailto:StephenY@hawaii.rr.com">Faelene</a><br>
              <br>
              Pottery is the art of making jars, bowls, and pots out of clay and 
              other natural materials. However, for the most part, the only people 
              for whom pottery is useful for are bakers (who cook things with 
              it), and smiths (who make the pottery into stuff for bakers). <br>
              Recently Rogues have been able to make poison, and they require 
              vials which can be made using pottery -- so now there is more use 
              for pottery. There are a lot of things that you can make out of 
              pottery that are just as good as smithing them, However, they can 
              be a quite a bit more or less expensive, depending on what you are 
              making.</p>
            <p>I've worked on pottery for quite awhile now, and one of the things 
              that I must say is nice about pottery is that it, well, WAS not 
              very expensive -- The most expensive block of clay is about one 
              gold, a glass shard is about one gold, a High Quality Baking Sheet 
              goes for about 5 silver, and the water flasks and sketches cost 
              about 1 silver each. However, a patch released awhile ago adjusted 
              the prices of some of the sketches to an astronomical high, making 
              it very unreasonable to make unless you are certain of success.</p>
            <p>The second most expensive items in pottery are often the metal 
              bits, which must be fashioned by smiths. Also, some sketches cost 
              more than the others (Pie tins, muffin tins, etc). But enough rambling, 
              let's get on with the basics..</p>
            <p>Put about 5 points of skill into pottery if you want. You'll also 
              want to buy a Basic Pottery book for about a gold(?) or so. In it, 
              you'll find many basic recipies for clay items. Early on, I would 
              recommend making Medium Clay Jars -- They're relatively cheap and 
              easy to make(at least for me). To make a Medium Clay Jar, you'll 
              need the following (approximate cost):</p>
            <p>Medium Clay Jar sketch -- 1 silver<br>
              Flask of Water -- 1 silver<br>
              Medium Block of Clay -- 5 silver<br>
              Quality Firing Sheet -- forgot</p>
            <p>At least, I *think* that is the recipe. Check the Basic Pottery 
              book to make sure, then add ONE unit of water, ONE sketch, and ONE 
              block of clay to the potting wheel. Do NOT add the Sheet yet. Combine 
              the three items, and hope for the best. If it said &quot;the items 
              does not combine in those quantities&quot;, either you added too 
              much/not enough ingredients, or maybe the recipe was wrong.<br>
              Anyway, if the items combined correctly, you should have a nice, 
              unfired clay jar in your inventory. Once you're done with the potting 
              wheel, go over to a Kiln, which usually (but not always) is near 
              a Potting Wheel. Make sure it's a Kiln -- if you try to bake the 
              clay in an oven, or a forge, you'll probably end up ruining the 
              jar. Put one firing sheet and one unfired jar into the Kiln, and 
              bake. If successful, you should have a medium-sized jar, capable 
              of holding items. Medium and Large Clay Jars are useful and valuable 
              for newbies to have in areas where containers are harder to find 
              (Freeport for example).</p>
            <p>Keep making these jars. If you wish, you can also try other things, 
              but don't try anything too difficult. At 50 skill I was struggling 
              to make pie tins and muffin tins, and Medium Bowls proved almost 
              impossible to make. Stay small, with jars, skewers, and ceramic 
              lining. Once you get tired of making jars (personally I prefer ceramic 
              lining because you can stuff them into containers, unlike<br>
              jars... never tried skewers, though), try ceramic lining. You should 
              sell your products to either bakers or NPCs in order to fund your 
              pottery trade. The ceramic lining requires:</p>
            <p>Ceramic Lining Sketch -- 5 silver<br>
              Flask of Water -- 1 silver<br>
              Small Block of Clay -- 1~2 silver<br>
              Quality Firing Sheet -- forgot</p>
            <p>A bit more expensive, but worth the extra money, in my opinion. 
              Continue making these until you reach the point where you get the 
              message, &quot;This item is trivial for someone of your skill level 
              to make..&quot; when you're using the *potting wheel*. Baking the 
              item in the kiln is rather easy, generally, baking a clay item will 
              result in success, especially later on. At this point, hopefully 
              your skill will be at around 30. I began making pie tins and muffin 
              tins at around 40, and I was soon able to raise my skill to 100 
              quickly. However, the main caveat with this is that with such a 
              low skill, you will be prone to failure, and every failed attempt 
              will cost TONS of platinum now. I was able to raise my skill quickly, 
              but that's due to high intellect and low prices. I would highly 
              suggest finding an alternate item which would allow you to raise 
              your skill until you hit at least 50, since many of the sketches 
              cost a fortune. In any case, here are the recipes...</p>
            <p>Muffin Tin Sketch -- 1 platinum(!)<br>
              Flask of Water -- 1 silver<br>
              Medium Block of Clay -- 5 silver<br>
              Metal Bits -- 1~2 gold<br>
              High Quality Firing Sheet -- 5 silver</p>
            <p>Pie Tin Sketch -- 1 platinum<br>
              Flask of Water -- 1 silver<br>
              2 Medium Blocks of Clay -- 1 gold<br>
              High Quality Firing Sheet -- 5 silver</p>
            <p>One of the best reasons to make Pie Tins instead of Muffin Tins 
              is that you don't need Metal Bits -- however, you will need to buy 
              lots and lots of clay to make up for it, as clay doesn't stack. 
              This is one reason why pottery isn't a huge money maker -- you have 
              to run back and forth gathering trade items, wasting time all the 
              way. Also, the more advanced items cost a whole ton to make now. 
              In any case, I would stick with the cheap items, until it becomes 
              trivial to make. </p>
            <p>The profitability of pie tins were exploited, leading to a price 
              hike to the sketches, but some conniving people used the patch to 
              gain money by buying pie tin sketches, making heaps of platinum 
              after the prices were raised. I wish they didn't have to do something 
              so drastic. Smart move for the rich boys and bad move for just about 
              everyone else. Oh well..</p>
            <p>One more thing... I started this business in North Freeport, so 
              I shall list the areas where I found the items:</p>
            <p>Sketches -- In North Freeport in building near Bank; also can be<br>
              found in Southern Desert of Ro.<br>
              <br>
              Clay -- In East Commonlands inside a building close to the inn nearest 
              town (merchant name is Merra Clayfinger, though he is often not 
              open for business). Also can be found in the Southern Desert of 
              Ro, and in the Blacksmith shop in North Freeport.<br>
              <br>
              Flask of Water -- Blue house next to Sketch shop in North Freeport; 
              or just about anywhere.<br>
              <br>
              Firing Sheets -- (Most irritating items to get) in Southern Desert<br>
              of Ro, or East Commonlands, from that slacker Merra Clayfinger.<br>
              <br>
              Metal Bits -- Buy from PC blacksmiths, or make yourself if you are<br>
              a smith.<br>
              <br>
              Glass Shards -- Buy from Merra Clayfinger or from Southern Desert 
              of Ro.</p>
            <p>Whew! Well, that's all the information I can think of right now. 
              I base my work in Northern Freeport, as most of the items I need 
              are there, though I must travel a bit to gather firing sheets. I 
              am now a master potter, and use my skill to replace my baking goods 
              when I foul up. Information, corrections, and other information 
              regarding this document can be sent to [<a href="mailto:StephenY@hawaii.rr.com">StephenY@hawaii.rr.com</a>]</p>
            <p>I would appreciate seeing this document being distributed to EQ 
              sites across the web so that people will be able to begin practicing 
              and offer their own experiences regarding this overexploited and 
              now overpriced trade skill.</p>
