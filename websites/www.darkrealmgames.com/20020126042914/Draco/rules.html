<p>Casters Rules... &amp; Practices - </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>General Members -<br>
1. All members will assist with corpse retrieval of other members if they are in the same
zone as the member in need (however I hope that members will assist even if someone is a
zone or two away). <br>
2. Members will NOT use foul or rude language towards others, regardless of the situation
you should act in a respecful manner. <br>
3. Members are NOT allowed to KS (kill steal) others. You have a right to defend what is
yours, but if a monster is obviously someone elses don't take it. <br>
4. Members should try to ask for advice but not for free items or money. Everyone is in
the same boat you are, regardless of their level. Remember that as people level their
spell costs and item costs go up. However you can go a long ways with a bit of advice. <br>
5. Try to sell goods at a discounted rate to other members, give them at least a 10% break
if you can. Although this isn't required, its' a good practice. And offer to your guild
first. <br>
6. Inform your guild of great deals or other such things they can profit from... for
example you are in a zone and someone is offering to buy a stack of bone chips for 5pp or
more, you don't have bone chips but someone in the guild might, just simply say *Bob Doe
is buying stacks of bone chips in EC for 10pp*. This will help out other members... or
*Zen Doe is selling an FBR in N Ro for 125pp*. Remember, you help the guild, the guild
helps you. <br>
7. If an issue arrises between you and another member of the guild, instead of causing
further arguement to a bad situation, contact an officer immediately. Officers are here to
help you! Let them. Whether its' to add someone to the guild, or if you have a problem,
please lean on the officers of the guild for help. <br>
8. If a fellow member needs a bind and you are with in two zones... bind them! We are here
for eachother thats what a guild is about. <br>
9. Being /anon (anonymous) is not allowed, if you need to hide your level/class then use
/roleplay. Myself or an officer will remind you, however if we have to keep doing this, it
shows us that you aren't interested in being in a guild and can result in removal. </p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p>Officer Rules - <br>
1. You must assist fellow members with common issues' such as binding. <br>
2. You must NOT be in /anon (anonymous) at any time, officers MUST always show their guild
tag, not doing so will result in demotion. Accidents do happen, so obviously I will ask
you, but if I have to do it more then a few times in a short period of time you will be
demoted. You are here for the guild members, and should show your tag. <br>
3. Officers need to announce when they log on, announcing must include your Rank
(Officer), Name (Thacs), and your current Location (EC or East Commons). <br>
4. If you have moved from your log in location by more then one zone you need to announce
it, please do this before you move, so if someone needs you in a zone you are going
through they can say something before you get to where you are going. If you forget and do
after you arrive no big, however you must announce. Everyone should remind officers who
forget to announce. Announcing doesn't take much time and is a great way for members to
recognize who the officers are, become familiar with them, and get more use of the current
officers. <br>
5. If a member of the guild is looking for a group, and you can assist in any way please
do. If for example they are going to Oasis and you know there are people in the area that
are their level try and get them in that group. <br>
6. Try and promote guild groupings, if there are members in the area, suggest they group
up. <br>
7. Its not required however Officers should try and form guild events. <br>
8. Officers should try and resolve guild issues if they can. I will handle player issues
if I am around but if I am not please do. </p>
