<p>Wednesday, January 31st:</p>

<p>New idea for guild titles I have would be something along the lines of this:</p>

<p>All new members would be:</p>

<p>- Neoteric</p>

<p>Neoteric means &quot;New&quot; so this would be the first title received.</p>

<p>Upon reaching a point they can receive a &quot;Quest&quot; or a &quot;Task&quot; from
at least one officer of the guild, which must be approved upon by at least one other
officer or the leader of the guild.</p>

<p>Once confirmed as completing this task you then become an &quot;Official Member&quot;
of the guild, this of course is only if the task was completed and there was no other
reason for you to be rejected by the guild.</p>

<p>- Official Member</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once you have become a full member of the guild you then may consider other routes,
such as becoming an officer. To attain this title the following requirements must be met:</p>

<p>You must have first become a full member of the guild, which means you must have
quested or performed a task, as well as be accepted with out doubt to your value to the
guild. You must also have accomplished at least the 20th season.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Officer</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once you have become an officer you may then attempt to go even farther with in the
guild, the next area would be sort of &quot;specializations&quot; with in the guild. To
reach these you must have reached at least the 25th level, and you must perform a task
that is fitting to this new title you may receive. Upon filling the task that is needed
for these titles you must be approved by &quot;The Council&quot; which is explained later:</p>

<p>- Quest Advisor</p>

<p>Quest Advisor is one that is studied in quests, they compose articles of documentation
to explain the items and routes you take through questing to attain the successful
completion of a quest. To attain this you must have reached no less then the 25th level,
been an officer first, and have completed one quest, and document two. After fitting the
requirements &quot;The Council&quot; would then judge if you have performed to reach this
title.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Master of Crafts</p>

<p>Master of Crafts is one that is studied in a craft, they compose articles of
documentation to explain the items and skill levels to make an item in their chosen craft.
To attain this you must have reached no less then the 25th level, been an officer first,
and have completed one crafted item of no less then average skill level, and document two.
After fitting the requirements &quot;The Council&quot; would then judge if you have
performed to reach this title.</p>

<p>- Council Member</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Upon completing these prior listed titles you could then continue if you so desire to
part of &quot;The Council.&quot; The Council would be made of at least no less then four
individuals of the guild, and even though they are not the direct ruling body of the
guild, they are looked upon as not only advisors but as the second highest ruling body of
the guild. The Council's purpose is also to maintain leadership in the guild, if at any
time the leadership of the guild were to need to step down, or no longer have the desire
to lead, the Council would then be required to choose one in the council to promote to the
level of Guild Leader.</p>

<p>The title progression is as follows:</p>

<p>&nbsp;

<dir>
  <li><pre>- Neoteric</pre>
  </li>
  <li><pre>- Official Member</pre>
  </li>
  <li><pre>- Officer</pre>
  </li>
  <li><pre>- Master of Crafts</pre>
  </li>
  <li><pre>- Council Member</pre>
  </li>
  <li><pre>- Guild Leader</pre>
  </li>
</dir>

<p>Saturday, June 4th: <br>
Currently I am considering a new title system, however I don't have current title ideas'
as of yet. I will post the point system that I have come up with so far, however I will
not have the titles posted until I am sure what they can be.. </p>

<pre>
</pre>

<p>Each title has a required point value, if a title has 100 points, then you need 100
points to have that title. Points are not spent, they are just totalled to see where you
are. </p>

<pre>
</pre>

<p>100pts - First Title Gained <br>
200pts - Second Title Gained <br>
300pts - Third Title Gained <br>
400pts - Fourth Title Gained <br>
500pts - Fifth Title Gained <br>
600pts - Sixth Title Gained <br>
700pts - Seventh Title Gained <br>
800pts - Eighth Title Gained <br>
900pts - Ninth Title Gained </p>

<pre>
</pre>

<p>Points are earned by: </p>

<pre>
</pre>

<p>25pts for every 10 levels, if you are 10th level you get 25 points, when you hit 20th
you get another 25. <br>
5pts for binding a member of the guild <br>
10pts for assisting a member of the guild who is not in the zone you are currently in <br>
20pts for recruiting anyone who has a /surname <br>
</p>

<pre>
</pre>

<p>Points are lost by: <br>
25pts for using /anon (you can use /roleplay if you MUST hide your class/level) <br>
20pts for charging fellow members for any buff or bind (this includes asking for
donations) </p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p>Members of the guild also can request that someone should be awarded or lose points,
however there must be clear reason as to why, and the suggestion must be approved by
myself before points are awarded. This system is only for those that are interested in
utilizing it, no one has to take part in the title system. The only exception to taking
part is if you are constantly reminded to stay off /anon then I will give negative points
to track the number of times you were asked to use /roleplay instead or neither. </p>
