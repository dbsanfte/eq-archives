            <P>Thursday, April 26th, 2001:</P>
            <P>CoM is back! And for good!</P>
            <P>Last evening while in Overthere a GM contacted me and inquired as 
            to if I it was ok to re-activate the guild to Kuahara. It seems that 
            Kuahara after selling the guild to Mallian that he started to remove 
            those that Mallian added, and ended up removing himself and 
            contacted a GM to get it back. Since the guild was registered to me 
            the GM asked my permission. Of course I said no and that I'd like 
            control of it again.</P>
            <P>Radical, Cummel, and Daxmar are now officers, and will be trying 
            to get all our old membership back, in the future we'll have a few 
            changes, such as a level requirement, and a required application 
            process to enter the guild.</P>
            <P>If I ever have to leave the guild will go to Radical, if Radical 
            or I leave him and I will choose someone. This guild must live, it 
            has been here for several years and has a rich history of some of 
            the greatest players in Fennin Ro taking part in it.</P>
            <P>Peace to all my brothers and sisters of EQ.</P>

Originally when the site was built my main focus was on site content and getting the site up and running, however I had always planned on a new look for the site. So here we are, a new guild site look. Of course this does not mean this deseign is permanent, only that its the one we utilize now.</FONT></PRE><PRE><FONT face="Book Antiqua" size=3>I thank every one for their patience, I have been putting in many hours into Dark Realm Games.com main site and not the hours into this site that I had origally freed up. The rest of the site will start to look different as soon as I have the time.</FONT></PRE><FONT
