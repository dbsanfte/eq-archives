        5pm EST (East Coast, USA)<p>Our next raid will be held in Paw! Lots of gnolls and such
        here, and my understanding is that this is a 20's+ area, make sure to talk to others to
        verify this. There will be porting set up from Butcher Block and West Commons through the
        morning before the event. The event was set up by Radical, so if you see him online let
        him know you appreciate him setting this up. Both Radical and Daxmaer will be porting,
        however if someone else would like to help out please do.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>June 17th, 2000 - 1pm PST (West Coast, USA)<br>
        Our next event will be held in High Pass Hold against the Orcs and Gnolls of High Pass,
        and from these foul beasts we will sieze great wealth from ring mail, and other valuable
        items. I would say this place is 16 and up, however if anyone is around 14+ and there are
        enough members of higher levels to heal/buff and to keep an eye on them, it should be ok. </p>
        <p>If the Crush Bone orcs thought they got a beating... well wait till the ones in High
        Pass see what we can do now. </p>

        Our next event looks like it will be held in Oasis yet against the Orcs, Caimans, and
        DW's. If anyone has reasons to select a different place please let me know. The event
        would take place Saturday the 3rd of June after 12pm. This place is 12 and up in levels if
        you are in a group, of course everyone that attends should be ready to help fellow
        members. </p>
        <p>The last event didn't go over very well, even though the CB Raid went great! We had a
        lot attend that event so gather up your things and head to Oasis! </p>
        <p>Officers should reveiw locations to hold events, using the consideration of the members
        levels. Also lets use this as a chance to recruit new members! Remember right now we
        actively seek out 15th and up! </p>

        Storm Crushbone! The event to storm Crushbone seemed to be a success, several of the lower
        leveled members held the forces of Clan Crushbone at bay at their own entrance, as the
        others marched into the heart of the castle itself. Many of the members took it upon
        themselves to march into the slavers area to free the slaves that have been kept under
        control by the Crushbone orc hoards. </td>
