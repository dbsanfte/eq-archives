              Loot Policy :</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">
Raid items are being awarded by officers. In most cases officers will ask those present, who need the item, and then will discuss amongst themselves the people that need the item, what they have been awarded lately, and how much it will help them if they are awarded the item. We will try to distribute items so everyone gets something at sometime but also to those who need it the most and help the guild the most.
<p>
If you attend our raids, please ask ahead of time what loot will and will not be available if you are outside of our guild. As of right now there is no clear cut responce.
<p>
You may only request items for the toon present unless all present pass.<br>
Exception:<br>
If you were going to take a different toon of the right level, and were asked to bring another, you may roll on the toon's items you did not bring, and not on the items for the toon you did bring. You must state this intention before the raid to the raid leader or loot dealer.
<p>
<b>Ninja Looting</b> will never be tolerated under any
circumstances. This doesn't mean a multi-questable
item can't be looted prior to a complete wipe-out.
However, if you do not have rights to loot a no-drop
item it is better to let the item rot then loot
inappropriately.

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">First 
              all applicants must have a sponsor. This sponsor will be responsible 
              for making sure you have the opportunity to join us on some events, 
              groups, etc. and it will be the responsibility of that sponsor to 
              report to us and recommend you for membership. A member can only 
              sponsor one person at a time. All applicants need to apply on our 
              site (soon to be coming to a theater near us). Once the application 
              has been completed there will be a 3-4 day comment period on that 
              application from all or any members. If two or more members have 
              a concern the enforcement committee will step in and do an evaluation. 
              More then likely, if two or more people have a concern they will 
              not be accepted. If there are no concerns, they will be an &quot;interim&quot; 
              guild member. They will have our tag, participate with us in any 
              and all events, and get to know us. This &quot;interim&quot; period 
              will last 2-4 weeks. During this time further comments will be able 
              to be made either in support or rejecting this candidate. If the 
              overall message is positive they will be moved by the membership 
              committee to full status and have access to the full boards. If 
              negative, the will be moved to the enforcement group for enforcement.

              they deem is in charge of the merger from their end. they draft 
              a 'plan' which contains all the relevant info about the merger, 
              such as: names of the people being merged, how long we 'grandfather' 
              people in, which (if any) officers keep an officership in Asatru, 
              and whether the merging members are automatically full members or 
              trial members. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">after 
              that has been completed, it's put to both guilds for review, and 
              both guilds comment on it and suggest changes. it's up to the officer 
              from Asatru to change what they deem necessary, but the officer 
              from asatru and the officer from the merging guild have to let each 
              other know what changed. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">after 
              3 or so days of review, it gets changed into a poll, and 2/3 of 
              the votes need to be in favor of the merger. the voting should take 
              at least 5 days, to give everyone a chance to make up their final 
              mind and for those that don't check the board as often.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">if 
              approved, officers can start inviting the former guild members and

              isn't approved, the officer from asatru and the officer from the 
              othe guild revise their plan and re-submit it to both guilds for

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>1.</b> 
              If a Raid is scheduled for a specific time, it will start at that 
              time. Neither sooner nor later. Exceptions will be made if the case 
              justifies it. This, however, does not include waiting for people 
              or the Raidleader thinking he/she cannot wait.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>2.</b> 
              If a participant is late for the raid, whatever circumstances may 
              have caused it, he/she will be brought in if the situation allows 
              this. Should this not be the case, the participant can either wait 
              till we are able to get him/her in or cancel participation in this 
              raid. If the participant is late, he/she goes to the bottom of the 
              reserves. Reserves are taken in order of need, not necessarily in 
              order of signup.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>3.</b> 
              The commands of the Raidleader are to be followed at any times. 
              Failure to do so will be followed by a one time warning and if that 
              does not help it will result in the banning from this or even further 
              Asatru-lead Raids. Nobody is perfect, but if a participant is willingly 
              rejecting orders or not listening to them we need to kick him/her 
              out to ensure that the raid is not being put into danger by that 
              person. See the Raidleader as your commanding officer and follow 
              his/her commands to the point. A raid is not a democracy.</font></p>
