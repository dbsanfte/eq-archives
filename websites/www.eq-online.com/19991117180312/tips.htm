<p>
If you're near a guard and another PK challenges you, don't fight back.  Let 
the other guy take the first swing or cast the first spell, and the guard 
will take him/her out for provocation.
<p>
Also, if you're getting massacred by another PK and know you're going to 
die, if you are within running distance of an NPC, commit honorable suicide 
by attacking the NPC, that way an NPC kills you and your loot can't be taken 
by the PK, since the PK didn't actually finish you off.
<p>
<center><B><font face="helvetica" size="3">Tip for Wizards</font></b></center>
<p>
After you reach level 8, you will find that you cannot survive at melee
with nearly anything that will give you experience.  As you know, for a
wizard, parting is essential.  During a fight with your party, do not
attempt to melee at all.  When you are struck by a NPC it will interrupt
your cast, and because you cannot use your melee weapon very
effectively, you probably won't hit it or do much damage that way.  It
is much more effective to stand back altogether and cast for 35 damage
with Shock of Ice and hit without interruption.  When you use all of
your manna, do not engage in melee.  Instead, step back and meditate so
that you can get one more good cast in before the fight is over.
However, tell your party about your combat style before you attack so
that they will know that they have to take the hits in advance.

<p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">
Dont kill decaying gnome skeletons unless you want to be KOS (Kill on sight) to the necromancers guild.  Also the merchant at the very entrance to Ak'anon
sells the Jr and Sr apprentice robes for Necromancers.  I found this out last night and since I see alot of naked gnome necro's running around I figure I would share the info.

<p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">
To get to the necromancy and shadow knight trainers:
Turn right at the wall of green skulls. Go to the T intersection and 
turn left down the tunnel. This leads to Neriak Commons.
<p>
You will be in a room with a waterfall on the right. Go right and down 
the ramp into the doorway at the bottom. The next room has two symbols 
of a face with tongue hanging out (will be referred to as 'tongue' from 
this point on) flanking a sun symbol. Go through the wooden gate under 
the sun.
<p>
Go straight through up the ramp, under the star and down the ramp then 
go through the wooden gate under the sun symbol.
You enter a room with a tongue symbol under a sun symbol. Go through the 
wooden gate that is to the left as you face the symbols. Turn left at 
Adamant Armor, you'll pass BF (Blue Flame) on the right and Neriak Down 
Under on the left. The bank is in Neriak Down Under. The entrance to 3rd 
Gate is opposite the statue of a man in a fountain. The entrance is 
flanked by 2 suns on each side. Go through open doorway with wooden 
doors on each side.
<p>
3rd Gate
You pass right through another tongue symbol to enter a cavern with a 
crystal building decorated with 5 tongues (I believe this may be the 
magician's guild). Go right, not entering the building, following the 
ledge above a moat. When you are at the back of the crystal building, 
turn your back to it and go in the doorway facing the back of the 
building. You'll be in a room with a waterfall with a red eye symbol 
hanging in the middle. Go in the opening to the right. Pass through the 
curving hallway ending in a ramp. At the bottom of the ramp will be a 
room with a sun in the middle with a wooden gate. There are tongues on 
each side and open fires. Go through the wooden gate. The next room has 
sun, tongue and hand symbols over doorways. Go under the sun symbol. The 
next room has stairs to a rabbit eared symbol. Go around the stairs to 
the right and througha doorway with an eye symbol over it. When you come 
out of the doorway you will have a tongue symbol on left, a bridge and 
swimming figure on right. Facing the tongue will be a doorway with 
stones that look like teeth in an open mouth and ghouls. Go through into 
a tunnel. When you emerge you'll see a red pagoda like building. Go down 
the ramp and straight in. In the center on the main floor are the 
necromancer and ShadowKnight trainers. Necro spells are on the main 
floor to your left as you enter.

<center><B><font face="helvetica" size="3">Word of advice starting a Wizard</font></b></center>
<p>
Here is a good trick I learned after a few tragic newbie attempts.  Mainly
works for magic using classes like wizards.  I will tell you what I did and
you can incorporate it how you will.
<p>
I created a gnome wizard and started the game inscribed and memorized my
first two spells.  Then found me a nice spot to stand around and hot keyed
both my spells. I just repeatedly cast them on myself over and over, I also
used the sense heading skill.  And to my surprise my spell levels (abjure
and evoke) and channeling continued to rise (currently lvl 2 wizard with 18
abjure 10 evoke and 17 channeling).  
<p>
Getting this stuff (especially channeling) can really help you out for
countless levels.
<p>

Gnomish Wizard
<p>
Now I know what your thinking what about food?  Simple run out and get
yourself killed.  You don't lose experience (under lvl 4) and when you
return to your home point you have 5 food and 5 water (same reason under lvl
4).  
<p>
<center><B><font face="helvetica" size="3">Corpse Command ( /corpse )</font></b></center>
<p>
If you ever die should die in a very bad spot...say in a pool of man-eating
sharks or pirahana infested waters for example and you need to recover items
from your corpse and not re-enact your original death scene over and over as
in some sort of grim, dark comedy, use the /corpse command. 
This will summon your corpse to you. Of course you must be close by for this
work. But work it does. Believe me it can save you a lot of grief and
frustation.

<p>
If you know you are going to die, and there is no way out, do a /loc before you bite the dust, and you will know where your body is.

<center><B><font face="helvetica" size="3">Tips for low level Warriors</font></b></center>
<p>
Tired of waiting forever early on(up to level 5) for your precious health to 
regen*? Why bother? Go into combat and die. Take on that extra mob you don't 
think you can take. Only a few things can happen.
<p>
1. You kill the mob. Yah!! 
<p>
2. You die. No worries, you don't lose any exp and save a short trip to your 
corpse you haven't wasted much time. You could always find the coveted 
respawn point and head for it once your on your suicide run(makes the trek 
even easier). You get new food, waste no real time healing and wala your 
back in the mix killing things and gaining exp with a full bar of health.
<p>

*This tip of course doesn't apply to trolls who have the natural ability to 
heal much quicker.

Ok I am not sure this works, but someone on my server told me that if you turn TRADE off in the general options window it will not allow people to give weapons to your pet.
After all when you are a 16th level necromancer, having someone give your pet a rusty dagger can piss you off :)
<p>
<center><B><font face="helvetica" size="3">Tiny daggers</font></b></center>
<p>
Tiny daggers use the Archery skill, equip one and you can improve your archery skill very well.
you will only do 1 point of damage so fight something you know you can kill, but your archery will go up quicker.
