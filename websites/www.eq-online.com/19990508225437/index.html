<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>Krimzon to do EQO maps</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica">Krimzon a loyal EQO veiwer has contacted me about doing maps for EQO, I have seen only one from him so far, but it blew my mind!  It was to say the least, AWESOME!
We will be displaying his work shortly.  And re-doing the map section in the process.
<p>
<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>#2 at Simsearch in one day</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica">Hey thanks all for voting, we are currently rated #2 out of 100 on our first day on the Simsearch Top 100 sites, the #1 site is a Sim site, blah ;p
<p>
<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>Patch Problems?</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica">Alot of little quirks and problems have been reported during the last couple weeks of patching, my own account had a nasty bug hit it, and it is still not fixed, Daknor has also been affected by some 'strange' things.
We are not at liberty to mention anything just yet about any of these problems, but we will keep you informed.
<p>
<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>Spell Locations and Descriptions</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica">We are looking for more info on spell locations, like the 20th level Magician pet spells? Hungry earth necro spell?  Also we are looking for detailed descriptions of what a spell does.
If you play a magic user you might want to consider doing a write up for out newly added Spell Analysis page :)

<p><font face="helvetica" size="1" color="white"><b>Updated by <a href="mailto:wraith@eq-online.com">Wraith</b></a></font><p>
<p>
<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>Spell Analysis section</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica">After receiving a few submissions on analysis of spells we have decided to put together a spell analysis section. This new section will include detailed explanations and in some cases unconfirmed reports of exactly what a spell does.
This section should be up some time today.
<p>
<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>Equipment section updated</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica">Equipment section has been updated to include a few Fine Steel weapons, and all the bronze weapons in the game.
<p>
<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>Shot of the Day</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica">Back by popular demand, this is a shot of Meldrath the Malignant over in the Steamfonts, if you hunt mino's there you have probably met this gnome, a high level necromancer who likes to charm people.
We put this shot up about a month or so again, now it is back up due to popular demand.
<p>
<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>Latest changes to EQ</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica">On a personal note I would like to assure all rogues that safe fall does now work as intended, and you do get the "you have increased your skill" message when it goes up!
Also I know alot of Rogues are pissed that make/apply poison are not in the game, but look at it this way, when they are implemented this will be a Rogue only trade skill :)
<p>

<b>Gameplay Change</b><br>
+pvp Player A’s corpse will only be lootable by +pvp Player B if Player A was killed by Player B or 
someone in Player B’s party.  A +pvp Player’s corpse will no longer be lootable if he was killed by an NPC 
or other means.   
<P>
<b>Skills</b>
<p>
<b>Disarm Traps</b> -- Clarification<br>
The Disarm Traps skill only works on moving traps (i.e. Not invisible walls, floors, etc.)  Disarm traps is 
activated by clicking on a moving trap.  Messages indicating whether the skill was successfully activated 
(which is based both on the player’s skill level and the type of trap) will be added shortly.
<P>
<b>Sense Traps</b> - Clarification<br>
The Sense Traps skill only works on moving traps (i.e. Not invisible walls, floors, etc.).
<P>
<b>Make Poison</b> - New Functionality<br>
The Make Poison skill will be implemented as a trade skill in the future.  It will be similar to other trade 
skills, and will involve combining poison components to create various types of poisons.
<P>
<b>Apply Poison</b> - New Functionality<br>
The Apply Poison skill will be implemented such that a character will be able to apply a poison in his 
inventory temporarily to his or her primary weapon.  The effect of successfully hitting an opponent and 
successfully applying poison will vary depending on the type of poison used.
<P>
<b>Specialization</b> - New Functionality<br>
The various Specialization skills will be implemented such that if a spell is cast in, for example, the 
abjuration family, the Specialization Abjuration skill will be checked (if present) and if successful, will 
decrease the amount of mana used to cast the spell.   The Specialization skills are as follows:  
Specialization  Abjuration, Specialization--Alteration, Specialization--Conjuration, Specialization-- 
Divination, and Specialization--Evocation.
<P>
<b>Spells</b>
<p>
Please note that Beta was used for testing spells.  Some spells did not make the final cut for release.  This is 
what Beta was used for testing the viability of spells and their impact upon game balance.
<p>
Unless noted below, all spells work with their intended effects. 
<p>
<b>Scheduled Changes</b>
<p>
Identify: The identify spell was originally going to reveal the statistics of an item (Damage, Weight, 
Weapon Speed, Ac, etc.).  We decided, however, to leave in the Beta ability of right-clicking an item for 
information.  The identify spell will soon be used for revealing the lore, if any, associated with item.  Lore 
will only be found on high magic or Artifact level items  an item with lore will typically be rare. 
<P>
Detect Magic: This spell will be replaced with a new spell sometime in the near future.  All players who 
have purchased this spell will have it automatically updated into their spell books.
<P>
Whirl till you hurl: This spell works as intended and at full effect.  There is a display error, where a 
‘monster’ will not be seen to spin when the spell is cast on them.   This will be fixed shortly.
<P>
Illusion: Air Elemental, Water Elemental and Fire Elemental: There is a display error that causes 
Enchanters who cast the illusion to look like Earth Elementals.  This is only a display error all NPC 
reactions are still based on the appropriate elemental type.  This will be fixed shortly.
<p>
<b>Changed</b>
<p>
Dark Pact and Allure of Death  these spells will no longer change your form in to that of a skeleton.  The 
remaining effects work as in Beta.  Higher level versions of this spell will continue to change your form to 
that of a skeleton.
<p>
Whirling Wind, Chaotic Feedback, Sanity Warp, Dizzying Wind, Force Shock and Chaos Flux: These 
spells are listed in the Strategy guild with the phrase Direct Damage and 2 sec stun, where they should be  
listed to say  Direct damage and knock the target our of spell casting.  These spells will disrupt spell 
casting, forcing the target to begin casting their spell again. 
<p>
<B>Removed</b>
<ul>
<li>Enchantment of Light</li>
<li>Enchantment of Brilliance</li>
<li>Winged Courier</li>
<li>Umbral Messenger</li>
<li>Detect Magic</li>
</ul>
<p>

<p>
Minor Illusion (Enchanter Spell)  a maximum size has been placed on objects that your illusion will copy.
<p>

<p>

300%.

draining HP from your target every time you attack.  Formally, this spell added to your attack roll.

<font size=2 face="helvetica">Well, after not receiving any adventure list emails for awhile, today I finally looked at the code to the page.
The email address those mails were sent to once you submitted info was my old email, not the new one.  So I have not received any of those submissions.
The guild submissions are coming in fine, but the Adventure list form was pointed to wrong email address.  This has been fixed and also that page and the guild 
submission page have been updated to reflect the new servers.

<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>Event on Rallos Zek PvP Server</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica">
On Saturday May 8 1999, Darkenbane and The Horde will launch an attack on
Freeport and surroundings zones between 10PM and Midnight EST (7PM and 9PM
PST).  We cannot give you the exact time, since this is a war.
<p>
As one of the larger and better-known guilds on Rallos Zek, I feel we should
take the initiative in building a community.  Many of our attacks are not
announced, but I know there are many roleplayers out there who have wished
to battle us.  Here is our announcement.
<p>
I will contact GMs to see about the possibility of turning off the Griffons
and Guards in ECommons for a few hours (or the GMs can contact me).
<p>
For more information, contact <a href="mailto:hollygo@RallosZek.com">hollygo@RallosZek.com</a> or head to
