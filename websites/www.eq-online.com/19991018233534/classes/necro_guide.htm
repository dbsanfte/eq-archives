The numbers in green are the primary stats for this class.  These are the stats that are suggested you increase.

These are the stats that a Necromancer will use more in his/her career.  Dexterity is important in determining whether

you will be interupted when casting a spell.  Intelligence is used to determine the casting abilities of a Necromancer. 

<p>

<center><b><font face="helvetica" size="3">Deities</font></b></center>

<p>

Necromancers have a limited number of deities they can serve, but these differ based on what race you pick.  

The Necromancer can choose as his Deities, depending on race:

<ul>

<li>The Plaguebringer</li>

<li>The Prince of Hate</li>

</ul>

<p>

Deities can affect how NPC's react to you.  Most elven races choose Tunare-The Mother of All as their Deitie.

This is because Tunare is widely worshipped in the elven lands, and NPC's generally regard you warmly by serving this deitie.

The choice is ultimately up to you.

<p>

<center><b><font face="helvetica" size="3">Skills for the Necromancer Class</font></b></center>

<p>

The Necromancer has a wide range of spell casting abilities.  And significantly less melee abilities.

<p>

<ul>

<li><b>One handed blunt</b></li>

<br>

This is your skill in one handed blunt weapons.  Weapons such as the mace, club, etc.

<p>

<li><b>Evocation</b></li>

<br>

Your skill in spells that utilize Evoking.

<p>

<li><b>Two handed blunt</b></li>

<br>

This is your skill in two handed blunt weapons.  Weapons such as Great staff, two-handed hammer, etc.

<p>

<li><b>Alteration</b></li>

<br>

Your skill in spells that utilize Altering.

<p>

<li><b>Bind Wound</b></li>

<br>

This skill stops a comrade from bleeding to death, it requires bandages, but can save a life.  When you drop below

your total hit points, you go unconcious, a party member must act fast to prevent you from bleeding to death.

<p>

<li><b>Defense</b></li>

<br>

This is your natural defense, your skill at avoiding blows this skill combines with Dodge to boost your overall defense against 

attacks.  This skill when improved slightly increases your Armor Class.  Note that this is your "natural" armor class, thus if you 

were to not wear armor, this would not lower the bonus provdided by this skill.

<p>

<li><b>Abjuration</b></li>

<br>

Your skill in spells that utilize Abjuring.

<p>

<li><b>Conjuration</b></li>

<br>

Your skill in spells that utilize Conjuring.

<p>

<li><b>Channeling</b></li>

<br>

Your skill in spells that utilize Channeling.

<p>

<li><b>Hand-to-Hand</b></li>

<br>

Hand-to-Hand combat is fighting with no weapon.  Bards will utilize this if they are using an instrument in 

one oe both hands and need to fight.

<p>

<li><b>Offense</b></li>

<br>

Like Defense, this skill raises your "natural" offensivness, meaning it raises your attack number and this bonus would still 

be there if you unequiped whatever weapon you are using.

<p>

<li><b>Piercing</b></li>

<br>

This is your skill in piercing weapons.  Weapons such as Spear, Dagger, etc.

<p>

<li><b>Sense Heading</b></li>

<br>

This skill allows you to sense which direction you are heading.

<p>

<li><b>Divination</b></li>

<br>

Your skill in spells that utilize Divining.

<p>

<li><b>Swimming</b></li>

<br>

This is your ability to swim and to hold your breath for longer periods of time.

<p>

<li><b>Throwing</b></li>

<br>

This is your skill in thrown weapons.  Weapons such as Throwing axe, Shuriken, etc.

<p>

<li><b>Fishing</b></li>

<br>

Your skill in fishing determines how many failures you have before actually catching a fish, it also should help 

you avoid breaking your fishing pole.

<p>

<li><b>Baking</b></li>

<br>

Your ability to bake things.

<p>

<li><b>Tailoring</b></li>

<br>

Very useful for a beginning bard, you can take wolf pelts and make patchwork armor out of them.

Patchwork is almost as good as leather, and if you get a blacksmith you can also add studs to your 

patchwork armor making Studded leather.

<p>

<li><b>Smithing</b></li>

<br>

As mentioned above this is your ability to shape steel or other metals into useful objects, like lantern cases, 

studs for leather armor, even metal armor.

<p>

<li><b>Fletching</b></li>

<br>

This is your ability to make arrows.  There are a wide range of materials you can use to make arrows, these will be 

listed under a different section.

<p>

<li><b>Brewing</b></li>

<br>

Your ability to brew alcoholic beverages, yeah!!

<p>

<li><b>Alcohol Tolerance</b></li>

<br>

Your ability to avoid adverse affects of alcohol.

<p>

<li><b>Beg</b></li>

<br>

This is a skill all races get, use this with extreme caution NPC's will kill you if you beg from them to much, 

or some if you beg from them at all!  So use this cautiuosly, I have heard reports of NPC's giving away some very cool 

things as a result of begging though.

<p> 

<li><b>Jewelcraft</b></li>

<br>

Not much is known about this skill, make jewelry from rocks?  No one knows, if you do find out 

let us know :)

<p>

<li><b>Pottery</b></li>

<br>

Makes pots, jugs, vases, etc.  This is your ability at making these.

<p>

<li><b>Common Tongue</b></li>

<br>

Common tongue is the common language of 

Norath.

<p>

</ul>

Here is a list of skills the Necromancer gets at a later level:

<p>

<ul>

<li><b>Meditate</b></li><br>

Level 4<br>

Decreases the time it takes to scribe, memorize, and regain mana.

<p>

<li><b>Research</b></li><br>

Level 16<br>

Research new spells?  Email us if ya know.

<p>

<li><b>Specialize</b></li><br>

Level 20<br>

There are quite a few of these spots, we are wondering if they are used for specializing in specific magic skills like Conjuration, etc.  Email us if you know for sure.

<p>

<li><b>Dodge</b></li><br>

Level 22<br>

Allows you to dodge blows in combat.

<p>

</ul>

<center><b><font face="helvetica" size="3">A few tips for Necromancers</font></b></center>

<p>

<ul>

<li><b>Starting Out...</b></li>

<br>

Welcome to the darkside of magic.  You have chosen a difficult path, and now there is no turning back.

This class will be easy for you if you have chosen to be a dark elf, the dark elves have respect for the masters of the 

dead, while other races shun the necromancer.  There will be NPC's who will kill you outright for your beliefs, and those that will 

embrace your presence, tread lightly while your are low of power, and walk with confidence when you have mastered the 

dark skills.

<p>

<li><b>Armor</b></li>

<br>

As a Necromancer you can only wear cloth armor, which is relatively cheap, I had all my cloth armor at level 4.  It's cheap and easy to get.

So buy it when you can, and get your pet spells to.

<p>

<li><b>Pets</b></li>

<br>

Master your pet commands!  Many mages I have seen get slaughtered because they let their pets run wild attacking things that will 

kill the Necromancer with ease.  The pet commands are as follows:

<p>

<li><b>Guard me</b></li>

<br>

This command tells the pet to guard you with his life, ANYTHING (except other players) will be attacked if 

it comes within a certain radius of you, even city guards, so be careful with this one.

<p>

<li><b>Guard here</b></li>

<br>

Very useful if you want to leave your pet in a certain spot and run back to a merchant and sell stuff.  They will

stay in the spot you left them and still attack anything that comes into the radius but if you left them in a good spot 

you shouldnt have to worry much.  The pet will guard until killed or until you get back and issue another command to the

 pet.

<p>

<li><b>Follow</b></li>

<br>

This command tells the pet to follow you and if you are attacked while the pet is in this mode, it will stop and attack whoever attacked you.

<p>

<li><b>As you were</b></li>

<br>

Returns the pet to neutral mode.  When in this mode it will just stand there until something attacks you.

<p>

<li><b>Overveiw</b></li>

<br>

This class can be hard to start but with a little perserverance and common sense you can become a very powerful character.
