<center><font face="helvetica" size="4">The perfect rogue?</font></center>
<br>
After I wrote the first part of this guide I got alot of email asking me "what is the best race to be a rogue?".  Well here is my opinion, lets take the time to break each one down, and see which one is the best.
<p>
<center><font face="helvetica" size="4">Halflings</font></center>
<br>
By far the best starting dex and agility, with the wood-elf and half-elf running a close second.
So as you can see the base stats of the class have the highest for the prime resiquite of a rogue which is 
Agil and Dex.  Here may be the downfall, second lowest charisma of any race able to be a rogue.  This wont affect you much at the beginning but later on when you start buying things that cost 50-60 plat or so.
You could start seeing a big difference in what you are paying and what another higher charisma character pays for the same item.  There is a way around this though and that is to get a freind who has high charisma to get you the item at the reduced rate.
<p>
<center><font face="helvetica" size="4">Wood-elves and Half-elves</font></center>
<br>
I linked these two because both of these races seem to be very well balanced.  If you like the balanced characters either of these two should be great for your rogue.
Since they have decent base stats you can pump up the prime resiquites which are dex and agility without fear of any other stat being to low.
<p>
<center><font face="helvetica" size="4">Dwarf</font></center>
<br>
Dwarves are not bad either, second highest base strength for a Rogue.  And their dex and agility starts at a good point too.
Their downfall again would be Charisma.
<p>
<center><font face="helvetica" size="4">Gnome</font></center>
<br>
Gnomes aren't bad, I play one now obviously.  And I find the high intelligence this race starts with to be a bonus when learning new skills and improving skills.
I usually max hide and sneak 10 minutes into raising a level.  Their dex and agility dont start off to bad either.
However their strength is kind of low.  One other thing I should point out is that the rogues guild in Akanon consists of one NPC, who is only there to train you, he gives no quests or anything.
This was the worst part about it for me.  
<p>
<center><font face="helvetica" size="4">Barbarian</font></center>
<br>
Highest base strength and stamina of the races available to be rogues.  Lowest base dexterity of the other races available to be rogues.
Barbarians would be an option if you are looking for a slightly harder hitting, higher hit point rogue, who might be a bit clumsier :)
<p>
<center><font face="helvetica" size="4">Human</font></center>
<br>
Talk about average.  And your talking about the human.  75's for most of their base stats, not to bad if you like a well balanced character.  But you would need to buff up those dex and agility scores a bit, kinda low.
Also as with the Barbarians, they dont get Infravision.
<p>
<center><font face="helvetica" size="4">Dark Elf</font></center>
<br>
Not bad at all, highest base Intelligence of races available to be rogues, good dex and agil scores, innate ability to hide.
Very good race for rogues.
<p>
Well there you have it, my opinions on the pro's and con's of the different races.  If you really want to have a good rogue, my suggestion would be to play a coupla different races as a rogue for a few levels, and see which one works the best for you.
Gnome seemed to work the best for me so that is what I stuck with.
<p>

<p>
As you can see from the available races here, the halfling has the other races beat as far as base stats go.  The Prime resiquites for a rogues stats are Dexterity and Agility.
The Halfling starts off with the most and will more likely than not have more points in these than the other races.  But lets look at some pro's and con's here.
Some races start with a higher Base dexterity and Agility than other.  If your really worried about stats choose the ones you think would be best for the rogue you create.  Some of these races could make excellent rogues.
<p>
<font size=3 face="helvetica">Day One</font><br>
Ok, so here I go, rolling up a rogue.  Hmmm..what race to pick?  Well I chose the gnome, coupla reason on why too.  The Gnome has a high intellect, which allows you to learn things faster, my character right now at level 10 has maxxed:
Sense Heading, Pick Pockets, Hiding, Sneaking, Piercing, Offense, Defense, Dodge, Sense traps, and Archery.  With fletching getting up there :)  These guys get improves in skill quickly, and usually if I just walk by a conversation in another language I pick it up.
I have skill in 10 different languages right now.  So I think this was a wise choice.  The Gnomes do have a lowered base dex and agility but as mentioned above there are other benefits.
<p>
Once I hit sixth level things started to get interesting.  In beta you obtained Pick pockets at level 3 now it is level 7.  So I was kinda bummed I couldnt steal cash off monsters at earlier levels.  But that was alright.
For the points I gained everytime I raised a level I saved almost all of them.  Put only one in the skills I needed to learn like Dodge, and hiding.  Because you have to put a point in these skills to learn the basics of the skill.
I estimated at 10th I would have 35 points saved, which when I reached tenth is exactly how many I had.  Things are pretty quite as a rogue until you start hitting higher levels.  And 10th level should be your goal right from the start.
It was mine :)
<p>
<a href="backstab.jpg"><img src="backstab_thumb.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left"></a>
Also I should mention that as a rogue you want to work on your piercing skill constantly.  When you get backstab you can only cause backstab damage with a piercing weapon so if you dont have a high skill in piercing it could affect the damage your backstab does.
You can see how much mine does in the picture to the left.  I should also mention you can only backstab from behind...as if you didnt know :)  But the damage in that screenshot is how much I do normally.  If I fight something that cons yellow to me I do a little less.
And this skill seems to go up slowly.  I got one improve in the skill all last night, and I used it constantly, ask Bozilas! heheheh...  I usually start off an encounter by running up behind something and backstabbing it before I actually start fighting it.  Now there is a 
small problem here, you dont always hit, which is why you want to make sure your piercing skill is high if not maxxed for your level.  
<p>
In the picture above I am in the Misty Thicket.  The area right outside Rivervale.  I left my home continent of Faydwer at around level 8, being persuaded by Daknor to see the world. hehe.  So we got on the boat bound for Antonica.  Which was a little bit of an aggravating experience.
Right when we zoned into Freeport.  Dak and I lost our connections, she got back on right away but I couldn't get on fast enough and had to sit on the boat for another round trip.  Which sucked.  But finally I made it to freeport.  Once there I found that no human merchants would sell to me.
So I decided to head to Rivervale where I found out something very interesting.  When I got to Rivervale I noticed all the guards in the city were indifferent to me, which was ok, that basically means they neither love nor hate me.
And I found that the rogues guild members were amiable towards me which meant of course that they liked me.  Well I found a quest there given by the Sherrif that allows you to raise factions with the guards.  You have to bring war beads to the sheriff and in return you get a little bit of cash and
some exp.  Not much at my level but I returned alot of beads.  The problem I ran into was that after I had turned in a large number of beads, the thieves guild now wants nothing to do with me!  They wont train me or even talk to me, while on the other hand the guards and the sherrifs think I am pretty cool.
ACK!  So if you are a rogue, beware of this pitfall.
<p>
Being a rogue it is easy to practice your skills, Pickpocketing I have found is best practiced on the bi-pedal humaniod creatures (orcs, goblins, kobolds, etc) you seem to imp faster, I got very few if any improves off animals and the like.
Setting up hotkeys for the skills you want to practice is the best way, you'll definantely want a hot key for Backstab when you get it.  As you can see in the picture above I set one up for Pickpockets, sense traps, sense heading, backstab, sneak, and hide.
I practice these in those times when I am sitting there healing and basically not doing anything.  But as I said before pickpockets is best practiced on humaniod type monsters.  Now to do this you have to stop your auto-attack.  That is why it is good to have a hot-key for the pickpocket skill.
This allows you to quickly turn off auto-attack, pickpocket, and then turn it back on without missing a beat.

Ever wonder how things look from the eyes of one of the smallest races in Everquest?  Here is a picture of me taking on a Young Kodiac.  Which I was barely able to kill on my own hehe.
Overall I enjoy the Rogue very much.  And I think it is a fun class to play.  Below are a few other screenshots I got last night while I was practicing the roguish arts around Rivervale.
If you have any questions about the rogue feel free to post them on our <a href="/forums/general/">General Message Board</a> and I will answer what I can, additionally if you can think of anything I missed so far in this guide
email me and tell me about it.
<p>
When I do get higher level I am definantely going back to my homeland to kill a troublesome Ogre Shaman named Zamoochi, perhaps you have heard of her?  She killed me once when I was sixth level...and I am going to pay her back :)

<p>
Well, she died, twice :)  I loved slaying that ogre.  Well, now I am level 14.  And I have a few updates on the roguish type skills.
Here they are:
<p>
<center><font face="helvetica" size="4">Hide</font></center>
<br>
Ok, in beta I didn't see this used much, I used it alot going in for a corpse recovery or things such as this when I died.
When you die in Crushbone it's hard sometimes running in naked to get your stuff.  So hide proved very effective there, to bad you can't do it <i>while</i> you are looting your corpse, that would be cool.
So I have practiced this skill alot.  One thing you want to be wary of is the fact that if you are grouped with a bard their song will automatically reveal you if you are hidden and they run by.  But I have hid, at 14th level from 
Evil eyes a 30-40th level monster.  So it is effective for rendering yourself hidden, as long as you dont move :)  Theoretically though you could hide, run, hide, run, hide, etc until you got through a particularily nasty zone, like Beholder maze.
This skill is cool.  I also used a tip submitted to our message board by someone I dont remember who about conning a monster when you are hidden, if the monster cons indifferent then you are succesfully hidden.
If not and it still scowls ready to attack then you are still visible.  The only thing I dont know about hide is if the monsters that can see invisible in the game can see a hidden person too, I will try to find out though :)
<p>
<center><font face="helvetica" size="4">Sneak</font></center>
<br>
Someone mentioned this in an email to me, and how useless it was.  In beta yes it was pointless.  But now in final it seems to work well.  I was sneaking into orc and kobold camps getting a backstab off before they knew I was there, just using sneak.
You can't however walk up in front of them.  But if you walk behind them it seems to work really well.  Undead it appears you cannot sneak up on.  I tried sneaking up on a lesser mummy and a zombie and I couldn't do it.
So this skill definantely has it's uses.
<p>
<center><font face="helvetica" size="4">Sense Traps</font></center>
<br>
Went to a dungeon the other day, dont remember the name of it but it was the first place I actually detected a trap.  All it does is point you in the direction of a trap and say "you sense a trap in this direction".
I was using it to turn complete 180's hehe, was kinda fun.
<p>
<center><font face="helvetica" size="4">Safefall</font></center>  
<br>
This is a wierd one.  When you jump off something high sometimes you take no damage.  That is safefall, but I also got no message either.  As far as I can tell it has not improved.  At least I have received no message about it improving.
But it seems like a very good skill, low falling points I usually dont take any damage on, however I jumped off a mountain and took 119 points.
<p>
I am level 17 now, almost 18th.  And would like to update all you rogues out there on some of the higher level skills you will be getting.
<p>
<center><font face="helvetica" size="4">Dual Wield</font></center>  
<br>
I ran all the way back to Kaladim from the Estate of Unrest to train this skill, when I got to Kaladim I had discovered that this skill is automatic (at least for rogues).  When I went to train it I noticed it was already feeble and that I did not have to put a point into it.
Also this comes at level 15 not 16.  I think our stats our wrong on this, anyways I have also noticed that this skill is improving past my level cap.  My level cap right now is 90 my dual wield is at skill 98.  Kinda wierd.
<p>
<center><font face="helvetica" size="4">Double Attack</font></center>  
<br>
I am like a little machine gun now, with double attack and dual wield going I hit alot.
<p>
Next level when I get Apply poison I will be sure to let everyone in on how it works, once I find out how it works that is :)
Here is a cool little storie about something that happened last night.
<p>
I was walking through Butcherblok having just zoned from Greater Feydark.  When in the distance I see Corflunk.  A big, smelly, ugly Ogre.
As he is running towards me I notice he is chasing a someone, later I realize this is a gnome!  And a rogue to boot!  A monster attacking a rogue around me is bad enough but a gnome rogue?
This ogre had to be taught a lesson.  As the little gnome rogue past me headed to the zone exit, I followed.  The rogue got away and Corflunk, discouraged by his fleeing prey turned to head back out to find another person to 
eat.  As he walked past me I sunk my combine spear deep into his back doing a good 46 points of damage.  Enraged by this he turned on me, wielding a rusty scythe he began to try and pummel me.
The first attack I parried, the second attack I dodged, all the while I was piercing and slashing furiously.  After a few rounds of very nasty abuse Corflunk decided he was outmatched by this mean little rogue.
He turned tail to run.  I brought my bow to bear and sent several arrows into his back.  He continued to run, just as he did, the gnome rogue I had been avenging zoned back in.  He turned and headed for her again!
One more backstab sent the Ogre to the ground.
<p>
Hey...us rogues gotta stick together :)  If I ever see a rogue under attack, especially a gnome rogue, you better bet I will jump in :)
<P>
More soon.......
