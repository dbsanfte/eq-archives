<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=167 HEIGHT=254 SRC="d_cazic_thule.gif"><font face="helvetica" size=2>Followers of Cazic-Thule fear their Lord and believe that

 only by causing terror in others will they be spared his

 vengeful wrath. They strive to beat down and suppress all

 hope. Fear rules their lives and through fear they rule the

 lives of others. Pain, misery, violence, torture, living

 sacrifice; these are the tools of a Cazicite. Many

 Lizardman tribes are devout followers of Cazic-Thule, but

 his number of humanoid followers grows daily, a cold

 shadow slowly engulfing the bright spots of Norrath in a

 nightmare of horror and pain.
