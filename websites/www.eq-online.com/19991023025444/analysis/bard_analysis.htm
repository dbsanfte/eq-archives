<p>
<pre>
Level 1: Chant of Battle
Effects: PARTY: +DEX  & +STR
Skill Used: Percussion Instruments
Location: Any
Notes: Won’t co-exist with Anthem De Arms
Rating: 3
Analysis: This is a good 1st level song and highly recommended as the primary buff song until lvl 6 (healing).  Initially, this gives you +5 STR and +5 AC.  As you go up in levels, this song will gradually become more powerful, especially when you can play an instrument instead of just singing.  This is a good buff song to twist with Hymm of Restoration (lvl 6).  Unfortuantly, Chant of battle does not appear to be able to co-exist with the 10th lvl song, Anthem De Arms.  When Anthem is active, and you try to invoke Chant, it will say “the song failed to take hold”.  On the discussion boards, someone has claimed +19 STR and DEX, and +5 AC at 30th lvl while playing with a drum.  In the same message, it was mentioned that this would be a boost for someone who is trying to do smithing.
 
Level 2: Chords of Dissonance
Effects: NON-PARTY: Damage to all non PC’s in 30’ radius
Skill Used: Stringed Instruments
Location: Any
Notes: Warning: area effect song
Rating: 2
Analysis: Commonly known as the ‘wince’ song as it causes all affected beings to wince for a few points of damage.  Be very careful!  This song will wince all non-PCs, including guards, inn keepers, etc…  I have died quite a few times because 1: I had this song going when I was too close to a guard or 2: I used this song to kill a monster and forgot to turn it off when returning to the safety of a guard to heal/rest.    For fun, when you get past lvl 8, go walk around the Freeport newbie area with this song on and see how man lvl 1 monsters you can kill just by playing this song.  As you level, this song will grow stronger.  Someone reported doing 16 damage per pulse with an instrument at lvl 30.
 
Level 3: Jaxan’s Jig o’ Vigor
Effects: PARTY: Stamina Return
Skill Used: Percussion Instruments
Location: All
Rating: 2
Analysis: At first, I thought this song was totally useless, but have found some limited uses.  Basically this song restores lost stamina.  Until you get your  lvl 5 song, Jaxan’s Jig o’Vigor is the song to play while traveling/running for long periods of time.  However, there is another use for this song.  Selo’s Accelerando does not work when swimming, but this song will.  With Jaxan’s, I was able to swim continuously for about 2 hours (actually, I fell asleep at the keyboard, don’t ask) and still had 100% stamina at the end. Also, for those long battles where stamina loss becomes an issue, this song will help (but not eliminate) this problem.
 
Level 4: Lyssa’s Locating Lyric
Effects: SINGLE:  Find Corpse
Skill Used: Singing
Location: Any
Rating: 4
Analysis: This is one of the more useful songs in the game.  It allows you to find corpses anywhere in your zone.  People are getting killed in odd places all the time and don’t know where to find their corpse.  With this song, you can help them.  Just click on the person whose corpse you want to find and then fire off the song.  If you want, I’m sure you can charge money for this, but I never do.  Making friends comes in handy when looking to group up. Just remember to turn the song off if you ever need to stop looking for the corpse (you come under attack/get to the corpse and no longer need it) as every few seconds, no matter what you are doing, this song will auto turn your body to face the direction of the corpse.  Necromancers (lvl 1) and Shadowknights are the only other spellcasters that get this ability. 
 
Level 5: Selo’s Accelerando
Effects: PARTY: Increases Movement and Stamina
Skill Used: Percussion Instruments
Location: Any
Rating: 6
Analysis: Even more useful than Lyssa’s Locating Lyric.  This song will probably be one of the most used in a Bard’s arsenal.  It makes you run… run fast.  When played with a percussion instrument (a skill which you also get at 5th lvl), you run faster than someone with the popular Spirit of the Wolf spell.  When not in combat/healing, always have this song on, in case you get jumped by a train, or if a griffin decides to reach out and touch you.  Yes, I have personally outrun the griffin with this song.  Also, you will be the toast of any party that is crossing zones as you will save them so much time.  Keep in mind, that when playing this song with a percussion instrument, you are faster than just about any monster in the game.  If you get attacked, just keep running and ignore them.  If you are under 50% HP or more, you will run slower, so if you have 1% hp left, you are not going to be ‘running like the wind.’  There is one problem with this song.  Sometimes it works too well.  When traveling with a party

 with this song.  Always bring up the rear, ie: be the last person in the party.  People always get left behind, due to lag, packet loss, or just because you are a human and they are halflings.  Run last… keep an eye on everyone.  Being last also helps out because if the person at the front of the party gets too far ahead, he will leave the range of your song, slowing down until you catch up again.  In places like HighHold Pass, it is very difficult to keep the party together because of all of the narrow twisty passages, so be careful.  Lastly, this song only works outdoors.  It will not work in places like Kaladim, or inside any indoor dungeons.  All of this aside, the most useful aspect of this song is that it allows you to run away from a monster who is smashing you just a bit too hard.  I can’t tell you the number of times I would have died had it not been for this song allowing me to run away.  Even when slowed by spells or low hitpoints, I was still able to get away a lot of times.  Keep this in mind.  

If you are soloing, this very ability will allow you to take greater risks in combat with less fear of dying and that is why this song gets a rating of 6 out of a possible 1 to 5.  Unconfirmed: supposedly you can break root type spells when this song is played.  This is supposedly NOT a bug, but a design issue.  In support of this rumor, you can ‘un-stick’ people who cast minor illusion on themselves to make them look like a lamppost/tree/rock/etc… so they can walk around.  
 
Level 6: Hymn of Restoration
Effects: PARTY: Healing
Skill Used: Stringed Instruments
Location: Any
Rating: 5
Analysis:  Second only to the 5th level Accelerando song, this song will make you the life of any party that has tank characters.  I have received many thanks for this song from clerics, who don’t have to cast healing as often.  In combat, keep in mind that every point that is healed by this song, will piss off a monster as much as doing 1 point of damage to it.  For example, if you are healing 6 players, for 6 points each, the monsters you are fighting will react as if you were doing an extra 6*6=36 points damage to each of them every pulse.  Use with caution, monsters may start to concentrate more of their attacks on you.  As you go up in levels and your singing/stringed skill goes up, this song will slowly heal faster and for more points per pulse. The rate of healing goes up about 2 points per pulse every 6 levels, hence lvl 12 heals at 8 points/pulse, lvl 18 heals 10 points/pulse, lvl 24 heals 12 points/pulse, lvl 30 heals 16 points/pulse, etc…
 
Level 7: Jonthan’s Whistling Warsong
Effects: SELF: +STR, +AC, +Attack Speed
Skill: Singing
Location: Any
Rating: 2
Analysis: For those soloing, this is an upgrade to the chant of battle song and is actually better that the 10th lvl Anthem De Arms.  This song also will increase attack speed a consistant 10%.  For example, it will reduce the delay of a longsword from 28 to 25. Of course, if you are in a party, this song should be avoided in lieu of Hymm of Restoration or Chant of Battle. Also, while this song is stackable with Anthem de Arms, the attack speed increases not stack.

 
Level 8: Kelin’s Lugubrious Lament
Effects: Target: Lower Reaction and Help
Skill: Stringed Instruments
Location: Kelethin
Rating: 4
Analysis:  This is the first of many songs that are not available in every bard guild.  At this point in a Bard’s character, we must now start our journeys across the entire Norrath for songs.  This song is very good.  It causes a monster to ‘become sad’ and ignore you.  This is the first Bard Song that is not continuous. You can Lament several monsters, one right after the other.  Doing this, you can lure a monster from a group, one at a time.  This is similar to the Soothe spell that Enchanters and other mage classes get, but is apparently stronger, and harder to resist.  Warning: sometimes when it fails, it will tend to attract everyone (including those that are already soothed)
 
Level 9: Elemental Rhythms
Effects: PARTY: + Protections - Fire, Cold, and Magic
Skill: Percussion Instruments
Location: Kelethin, Qeynos
Rating: 3
Analysis:  This is the first of the protection songs.  On a 13th lvl Bard, resistances are +9 singing, or +19 with an instrument.  This song is no longer broken.
 
Level 10: Anthem de Arms
Effects: PARTY: +Attack Speed, +STR
Skill: Singing
Location: Freeport, Qeynos
Rating: 4
Analysis: Basically, this is considered the next upgrade for the Chant of Battle type of songs.  In Party combat, the +Attack speed comes in handy for the tanks.  The attack speed will increase about 10%, sometimes a little bit less.  For example, it will reduce the delay of a longsword from 28 to 25. This is a great song to twist with another and should be used in almost all combat.  It will not stack with the Chant of Battle song.  Also, while this song is stackable with Jonthan’s Whistling Warsong, the attack speed increases not stack.
 
Level 11: Cinda’s Charismatic Carillon
Effects: Single/Self: Add NPC faction
Skill: Wind Instruments
Location: Kelethin
Rating: 1
Analysis:  It had great promise, but this song turns out to be mostly useless.  It is supposed to make NPC’s look upon you a little bit more favorably.  This is useful for quests that require you to have good faction to begin/end them. Prices from Merchants will also be affected by your faction, so the higher, the better.  When I’ve used it, I haven’t noted any change in how NPCs react tome at all.  This song is currently broken.
 
Level 12: Brusco’s Boastful Bellow
Effects: SINGLE: 1-7 points damage
Skill: Singing
Location: Freeport, Qeynos
Rating: 4
Analysis:  This is the first single person direct damage song in the Bard’s arsenal. This song, like Kelin’s Lugubrious Lament, is quick.  It does its thing, then ends.  In combat, treat this song almost as a warrior’s kick attack, which does similar amounts of damage.  In your average combat, you can cast this song about 10 times, which adds up to about 70 points damage.  Just like with Kelin’s Lugubrious Lament, after the song effects the monster, you can immediately cancel casting, so you can do other things, like re-cast the song.  Normally, after effecting the creature, the song still goes on for about ~5 - 7 seconds.  This time is totally useless and should be avoided. When casting this song, as soon as it says “Hit for 7 points non-melee dmg”, immediately cancel and recast the song, do not wait until the song ends on its own, there is no benefit.  Another lesser use of this song is to help out other people who need some assistance killing a monster.  Use this song a few times instead of getting directl

y involved in melee combat. Warning!  In dungeons, this song is the monster magnet of all time.  It has been known to draw monsters from totally separate rooms, through locked doors.  Be very careful with this song in delicate dungeon settings.  Does an extra point of damage per 2 levels, so does up to 9 points at 16th lvl, up to 10 points at 18th lvl, up to 11 points at 20th lvl, etc…
 
Level 13: Purifying Rhythms
Effects: PARTY: +Protection: Poison, Disease, and Magic
Skill: Percussion Instruments
Location: Kelethin, Qeynos
Rating: 3
Analysis:  This song is the same as Elemental Rhythms.  The only difference between these songs is the type of protection provided.  The level of protection is either +9 or +19, depending on whether or not an instrument is used. In particular, it appears that this song is tailored to combat the specific resistances needed to battle undead creatures.  This song is a must for combat with, mummies, zombies, and evil mages.  This song is no longer broken.

Level 14: Lyssa’s Cataloging Libretto
Effects: ITEM: Identify
Skill: Singing
Location: Erudin
Rating: 1
Unconfirmed Analysis:  The identify song was originally going to reveal the statistics of an item (Damage, Weight, Weapon Speed, AC, etc.). Verant decided, however, to leave in the Beta ability of right-clicking an item for information. The identify song will soon be used for revealing the lore, if any, associated with item. Lore will only be found on high magic or Artifact level items - an item with lore will typically be rare.  To obtain information about an item, you have to hold the item with your mouse.  Simply right-clicking on the item will not suffice.

Level 15: Kelin’s Lucid Lullaby
Effects: NON-PARTY: Enthrall & Nix S. List
Skill: Stringed Instruments
Location: Kelethin
Rating: 5
Analysis: What does “Enthrall & Nix S. List” mean?  Well, This song will attempt to make all monsters nod off and fall asleep.  It will nix the ‘shit list’ of a monster.  The ‘shit list’ is an internal list a monster keeps of everyone who has attacked it, and remembers who ‘pissed it off’ the most.  A monster uses the ‘shit list’ to find out who it needs to concentrate on when fighting your party.  Nixing this list will erase it from the monsters memory, so that it will no longer ‘track you down throughout the entire dungeon’.  Enthrall basically means that the monster will ignore your presence (until you start attacking it).  Sounds pretty powerful, eh?  Now when you get this song, don’t be thinking that you are instantly Mr. Badass and walk right into the middle of the Dervish camp in West Commons, expecting nothing to attack you.  When you first get this song, it is not very effective, but as you go up in level, it becomes stronger.  Word of warning, just like Chords of Dissonance, this song will affect ev

erything, including NPCs.  Please do not use this song next to a guard, or he will start attacking you. This song has recently changed, and mobs now have two chances to break out of the Lullaby every pulse. The first is a standard resist, which nullifies the song outright, and the second is the chance (which varies based on Bard CHA, instrument used, level spread, etc) to just plain ignore the song. Also, Kelin’s Lucid Lullaby now has a maximum of four targets.  You won’t be hearing any more stories about a Bard stopping a 27 mob train.  It's not totally a waste, it does reduce the volume of fire to the party, and the nod effect is great for making casters flub a spell.

Level 16: Tarew’s Aquatic Ayre
Effects: PARTY: Water Breathing
Skill: Wind Instruments 
Location: HighHold Pass
Rating: 3
Analysis:  This is the first Bard ongoing song that uses Wind Instruments (Cinda’s Charismatic Carillon is the first song that uses Wind Instruments, but it is a momentary song, it only lasts a few seconds), like horns or flutes.  Contrary to rumors floating around, an instrument is not required to play this song.  There are no differences in effects between singing and playing this song.  The effects of this song are pretty obvious. It allows your entire party to breathe underwater. Feel like walking from Freeport to ButcherBlock? Fall off the boat?  Well, this is a nice song to have.  This song is tough to get off.  Expect numerous song failures when trying to start up, until you get a few more levels under your belt.  Also, use this song to pump up your wind instruments skill to a respectable level, in preparation for the lvl 19 invisibility song.  There are two things I find interesting about this song.  First, I find odd that for a song that is effective in water that I have to go to a high mountain pass

 to get it.  Two, How do play a horn or a flute underwater?  

Level 17: Guardian Rythms
Effects: PARTY: Pro. Magic & AC & Spell Shield
Skill: Percussion Instruments 
Location: Kelethin, Qeynos
Rating: 3
Unconfirmed Analysis: Contrary to rumors floating around, an instrument is not required to play this song.  It gives +13 magic resistance and +4 AC when singing.  You get a lot more when played with an instrument.  Using a drum, twisting this song with the lvl 13 Purifying Rhythms, you can easily beef up a party’s magic resistance to at least 50.  Good for fighting Evil Eye’s and shamans.  As for the party spell shield, I really haven’t seen it do too much good.  I’m not even sure what this does yet.  It doesn’t appear to absorb damage or dish it out to mobs that hit.  Investigating.

Level 18: Denon’s Disruptive Discord
Effects: NON-PARTY: Damage & -AC
Skill: Brass Instruments
Location: Freeport, Qeynos
Rating: [not rated yet]
Unconfirmed Analysis: An upgrade song to the lvl 2 “Chords of Dissonance”.  While doing the same amount of damage, it additionally lowers the AC of all monsters within rage.  I have a feeling this song is very dangerous as it may cause all monsters to stop fighting everyone else and concentrate on you. Also, word of warning, just like Chords of Dissonance, this song will affect everything, including NPCs.  Please do not use this song next to a guard, or he will start attacking you.  At 30th lvl, it drops  AC 5 points and does 7 damage per tick without a horn, 14 with, and lasts for three ticks after it pulses.

Level 19: Shauri’s Sonorous Clouding
Effects: PARTY: Invisibility
Skill: Wind Instruments
Location: Erudin
Rating: 4
Unconfirmed Analysis: Group invisibility is nice.  The radius of invisibility is somewhat small, so caution.  You cannot twist this song with any other bard song.  As soon as you stop singing this song to sing another, your party returns to view. This song does not allow the party to see each other while invisible, however, it does help a little. Each party member affected by this song will be invisible, but will have a huge bouncing ball appear where they are each pulse. At 24th level or higher, there are additional particles that fan out from the ball, making predicting motion quite easy. Suggestion: Buy a flute and stand around singing Aquatic Ayre for a couple of hours, to advance your wind skill, as this song is hard to fire up with a low skill rating. Of course, if you are soloing, this song is extremely useful at getting through places like HighHold Pass, or if you are a good alignment character, helps when you are walking through Nektulus Forest.

Level 20: Largo’s Melodic Binding
Effects: NON-PARTY: -Attack SPD & AC
Skill: Singing
Location: Freeport, Qeynos
Rating: [not rated]
Unconfirmed Analysis: Song effects are obvious, reducing attack speed and AC of monsters and NPCs.  This song is one of the most dangerous, but useful, songs a bard can sing. It generates a much more hateful response than just about any other song besides Lullaby, but the reduced attack speed and AC is well worth the heat, in most cases. As with most songs, this one grows with the bard, the effect becomes more and more powerful as you level.

Level 21: Melanie’s Mellifluous Motion
Effects: PARTY: Short distance random teleport
Skill: Wind Instruments
Location: HighHold Pass
Rating: [not rated]
Unconfirmed Analysis: Every five seconds that this song is played; everyone in your party will be randomly teleported a short distance.  Apparently does not teleport you through walls or locked doors.  In a dungeon, this song can get you in a whole lot of trouble. Outdoosr, however, with a flute in hand, it has an amazing range. From the front gate of Qeynos, one pulse can jump you to the zone line. Lots of fun, you do a silly dance while playing it, but not real practical in the real world.

Level 22: Alenia’s Disenchanting Melody
Effects: PARTY: Cancel Magic
Skill: Stringed Instruments
Location: Kelethin, Qeynos
Rating [not rated]
Unconfirmed Analysis: right now, cancel magic is very buggy, so it’s usefulness will vary, but theoretically it will cancel all those nasty spells (heat blood, lifetap, root, etc…) that have been cast on your party by nasty monsters.  This song has the capability of being extremely useful.  This song is no longer broken.

Level 23: Selo’s Consonant Chain
Effects: TARGET: Slow Down Target Movement & Attack Speed
Skill: Singing
Location: HighHold Pass
Rating: [not rated]
Unconfirmed Analysis: Apparently a good soloing song, as it will make monsters move slower, so you can run around them, casting direct damage songs without being hit.  Also, if a monster is trying to run away, this song will supposedly root them.  It is similar to spell snare.  Unlike other spell casters, a Bard can sing this song while running after a mob that is trying to get away, making it very useful in places like Guk and Befallen, where mobs run away, only to come back later with a quite a few of their friends for some payback. This is a great addition to a Bard's arsenal.

Level 24: Lyssa’s Veracious Concord
Effects: PARTY: See invisible/ultravision
Skill: Wind Instruments
Location: Erudin
Rating: 3
Unconfirmed Analysis: Allows you to see invisible, as well as give you ultravision (useful for us blind humans).  This song also tends to give everything a bluish hue.  Too bad you can’t use it in conjunction with the invisibility song…

Level 25: Psalm of Warmth
Effects: PARTY: Cold Protection
Skill: Singing
Location: Erudin, Kelethin, Qeynos
Rating: [not rated]
Unconfirmed Analysis: Increases resistance to cold-based spells. Not much use has been found for this yet.  This song is no longer broken.

Level 26: Angstlich’s Apalling Screech
Effects: NON-PARTY: Fear
Skill: Brass Instruments
Location: Kelethin 
Rating: [not rated]
Unconfirmed Analysis: Will cause all monsters in it’s path to flee in terror, but only for about a minute or so, then they will come back.  This is a useful song if your party is trying to run, but failing, or if a party member, unable to run, is about to die.  This is an area effect Fear spell, mentioned as a “get out of death free” song, if used at the right time.

Level 27: Solon’s Song of the Sirens
Effects: TARGET: Temporary Charm
Skill: Wind Instruments
Location: Kelethin 
Rating: [not rated]
Unconfirmed Analysis: Will charm a monster for ~ 10 seconds.  During that time, the monster will respond to /pet commands.  Allows you to do things like charm DiVinn and tell him to attack Crush.  Be careful tho, because when the charm wears off, the monster will be very pissed off and will frenzy on you.  One interesting use of this song is that you can lure 1 monster from a group fairly easily. When charm wears off, just have your party attack it.

Level 28: Crission’s Pixie Chase
Effects: Target: Mesmerize
Skill: Wind Instruments
Location: Kelethin 
Rating: [not rated]
Unconfirmed Analysis: Does a nice little 'glaze over' effect, it's basically Mesmerize, while the mob is 'chasing pixies', he's ignoring you.

Level 29: Psalm of Vitality
Effects: PARTY: Protection from disease and Poison
Skill: Singing
Location: Kelethin, Qeynos
Rating: [not rated]
Unconfirmed Analysis: [none]. This song is no longer broken.

Level 30: [unknown]
Hint: “Look in a Library”

Level 31: Agilmente’s Aria of Eagles
Effects: PARTY: Levitation
Skill: Wind Instruments
Location: HighHold
Rating: [not rated]
Unconfirmed Analysis: useful song for exploring the Air Plane, or walking the oceans, looking for uncharted islands.

Level 32: Cassindra’s Chorus of Clarity
Effects: PARTY: Increased Mana Regeneration
Skill: Singing
Location: Kelethin, Qeynos
Rating: 6
Unconfirmed Analysis: This is the Holy Grail song of any party with magic users.  Supposedly will regen mana at twice the normal rate.
