The numbers in green are the primary stats for this class.  These are the stats that are suggested you increase.

These are the stats that a Wizard will use more in his/her career.  Dexterity is important in determining whether

you will be interupted when casting a spell.  Intelligence is used to determine the casting abilities of a Wizard. 

<p>

<center><b><font face="helvetica" size="3">Deities</font></b></center>

<p>

Wizards have a limited number of deities they can serve, but these differ based on what race you pick.  

The Wizard can choose as his Deities, depending on race:

<ul>

<li>The Plaguebringer</li>

<li>The Prince of Hate</li>

<li>The Mother of All</li>

<li>The Rainkeeper</li>

<li>The Queen of Love</li>

<li>The Burning Prince</li>

<li>The Lightbearer</li>

<li>The Prime Healer</li>

<li>The Oceanlord</li>

<li>The Tranquil</li>

<li>The Duke of Below</li>

</ul>

<p>

Deities can affect how NPC's react to you.  Most elven races choose Tunare-The Mother of All as their Deitie.

This is because Tunare is widely worshipped in the elven lands, and NPC's generally regard you warmly by serving this deitie.

The choice is ultimately up to you.

<p>

<center><b><font face="helvetica" size="3">Skills for the Wizard Class</font></b></center>

<p>

The Wizard has a wide range of spell casting abilities.  And significantly less melee abilities.

<p>

<ul>

<li><b>One handed blunt</b></li>

<br>

This is your skill in one handed blunt weapons.  Weapons such as the mace, club, etc.

<p>

<li><b>Evocation</b></li>

<br>

Your skill in spells that utilize Evoking.

<p>

<li><b>Two handed blunt</b></li>

<br>

This is your skill in two handed blunt weapons.  Weapons such as Great staff, two-handed hammer, etc.

<p>

<li><b>Alteration</b></li>

<br>

Your skill in spells that utilize Altering.

<p>

<li><b>Bind Wound</b></li>

<br>

This skill stops a comrade from bleeding to death, it requires bandages, but can save a life.  When you drop below

your total hit points, you go unconcious, a party member must act fast to prevent you from bleeding to death.

<p>

<li><b>Defense</b></li>

<br>

This is your natural defense, your skill at avoiding blows this skill combines with Dodge to boost your overall defense against 

attacks.  This skill when improved slightly increases your Armor Class.  Note that this is your "natural" armor class, thus if you 

were to not wear armor, this would not lower the bonus provdided by this skill.

<p>

<li><b>Abjuration</b></li>

<br>

Your skill in spells that utilize Abjuring.

<p>

<li><b>Conjuration</b></li>

<br>

Your skill in spells that utilize Conjuring.

<p>

<li><b>Channeling</b></li>

<br>

Your skill in spells that utilize Channeling.

<p>

<li><b>Hand-to-Hand</b></li>

<br>

Hand-to-Hand combat is fighting with no weapon.  Bards will utilize this if they are using an instrument in 

one oe both hands and need to fight.

<p>

<li><b>Offense</b></li>

<br>

Like Defense, this skill raises your "natural" offensivness, meaning it raises your attack number and this bonus would still 

be there if you unequiped whatever weapon you are using.

<p>

<li><b>Piercing</b></li>

<br>

This is your skill in piercing weapons.  Weapons such as Spear, Dagger, etc.

<p>

<li><b>Sense Heading</b></li>

<br>

This skill allows you to sense which direction you are heading.

<p>

<li><b>Divination</b></li>

<br>

Your skill in spells that utilize Divining.

<p>

<li><b>Swimming</b></li>

<br>

This is your ability to swim and to hold your breath for longer periods of time.

<p>

<li><b>Throwing</b></li>

<br>

This is your skill in thrown weapons.  Weapons such as Throwing axe, Shuriken, etc.

<p>

<li><b>Fishing</b></li>

<br>

Your skill in fishing determines how many failures you have before actually catching a fish, it also should help 

you avoid breaking your fishing pole.

<p>

<li><b>Baking</b></li>

<br>

Your ability to bake things.

<p>

<li><b>Tailoring</b></li>

<br>

Very useful in the beginning, you can take wolf pelts and make patchwork armor out of them.

Patchwork is almost as good as leather, and if you get a blacksmith you can also add studs to your 

patchwork armor making Studded leather.

<p>

<li><b>Smithing</b></li>

<br>

As mentioned above this is your ability to shape steel or other metals into useful objects, like lantern cases, 

studs for leather armor, even metal armor.

<p>

<li><b>Fletching</b></li>

<br>

This is your ability to make arrows.  There are a wide range of materials you can use to make arrows, these will be 

listed under a different section.

<p>

<li><b>Brewing</b></li>

<br>

Your ability to brew alcoholic beverages, yeah!!

<p>

<li><b>Alcohol Tolerance</b></li>

<br>

Your ability to avoid adverse affects of alcohol.

<p>

<li><b>Beg</b></li>

<br>

This is a skill all races get, use this with extreme caution NPC's will kill you if you beg from them to much, 

or some if you beg from them at all!  So use this cautiuosly, I have heard reports of NPC's giving away some very cool 

things as a result of begging though.

<p> 

<li><b>Jewelcraft</b></li>

<br>

Not much is known about this skill, make jewelry from rocks?  No one knows, if you do find out 

let us know :)

<p>

<li><b>Pottery</b></li>

<br>

Makes pots, jugs, vases, etc.  This is your ability at making these.

<p>

<li><b>Common Tongue</b></li>

<br>

Common tongue is the common language of 

Norath.

<p>

</ul>

Here is a list of skills the Wizard gets at a later level:

<p>

<ul>

<li><b>Meditate</b></li><br>

Level 4<br>

Decreases the time it takes to scribe, memorize, and regain mana.

<p>

<li><b>Research</b></li><br>

Level 16<br>

Research new spells?  Email us if ya know.

<p>

<li><b>Specialize</b></li><br>

Level 20<br>

There are quite a few of these spots, we are wondering if they are used for specializing in specific magic skills like Conjuration, etc.  Email us if you know for sure.

<p>

<li><b>Dodge</b></li><br>

Level 22<br>

Allows you to dodge blows in combat.

<p>

The Wiz by Mieth



<p>

Ok first i will give you the disadvantages to being a wiz. The first bad thing is that your melee skills are crap and you can depend upon them like a divorced dead beat dad with a crack adiction. The second bad thing is that your life is terrible and you find yourself running away from enemies like Carl Lewis on severe stimulent  medication. The next bad thing is that you will suck for a long time. I mean your going to be pissed when your level six and a level 3 anything else can beat your ass like a red headed step child.

<p>

Ok now the good. Good things coem to those that wait. some of your spells will be able to do some serious dammage latter on. It is going to take a long time and it will be very frustrating. You will eventually have the best defense in the game (the best offense). You will be able to cast your spells from a reasonable distance away. You can do a lot of dammage simultaneously. You have the spell gate which willl allow you to get the F*** out of there quik if your being PK'd or if your in danger or if you just feel like going home quik. I mean its a great thing when your in quenos and soem jerk feels like he needs to ferment his lack of manhood and starts attacking you and then you cast yourself back to toxx forest, yeah I'd like ot see him follow me then.

<p>

Alright enough, Ill start getting into it. Ok you will start off with 4 pieces of paper 2 spells a PK not and a guild note. First click on your book and then click on one of your spells and then drag it to an open box in the book and click. It will start scribing and it wil take a while. 

Next do the other spell. 

then click one one of the spells in your book and it will turn into a little rock, drag that onto one of your open spaces on the left where they are supposed to fit.

Now go find your guild and give the note to the Leader. You will recieve a guild tunic and soem exp.

You dont have to do this but i recomend it. Cast your minor shielding spell and then click on your skill sense heading. Just keep doing this till you get abjurbation up to lvl 10. remember to keep using your sense heading skill(very valuable)After this go find yourself a little spot where no one is around and where no one will kill oyu because you will be inflicting dammage upon yourself. now do the same thing with your shock of frost spell. make sure to get evoke and chanelling as high as you can just like abjurbation.

OH YEAH MAKE SURE NOT TO KILL YOURSELF WITH THE SHOK OF FROST SPELL

Ok time to go kill stuff. make sure that you are shielded and then go up to a snake or soemthing that says even fight . Always consider your oponents.start attacking with your dagger and cast shock of frost over and over till it dies. take the loote and save it till you go sell. Just keep killing stuff this way over and over and take the stuff so you can sell it. Soon you will know what gives goood money and decent experience ect and you can make more educated decisions.

Dont worry about dying too much before level 4 cause you dont lose exp and oyu start of with more food and water when you die. After you have accumilated soem items go sell them. At this point when you save up a gold or two always go back to the town and put it in the bank. Because you will die and oyu wont be able to find your corpse at this point. Just take my advice. And keep saving dont spend it !

ALSO IF YOU FIND YOURSELF OUT OF FOOD JUST GET YOURSELF KILLED AND YOUSTART OUT WITH 5 MORE FOOD AND WATER AS LONG AS YOU ARE UNDER LVL 4

<P>

Ok i can seee it now soem stupid newbs are going to save up some gold and get so anxious to go get spells and you are going to waste it on the wrong ones. So i will tell you what and what not to but for your first two ranks and then I think you can make decisions for yourself.

Dont buy any of the first rank spells. They start you off with all that you need and the rest are pintless. Trust me.

at second rank buy 

<p>

SHOCK OF FIRE<br>

GATE<br>

ROOT<br>

ICESTRIKE ( THIS ONE IS KIND OF IFFY BUT IT IS REASONABLE)<br>

THATS IT DONT BUY ANY OTHERS.<br>

<p>

also feel free to group with some people. you can both help each other and you are less likely to die.
