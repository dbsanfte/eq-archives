This document is intended to be an inclusive Paladin's guide.  In it, I
highlight the strengths and weakness of the Paladin class, and tell you what
and what not to do to be effective.  I have read all of the Paladin guides I
know of, and while they all contain good information, none of them IMO tell
you all you need to know.  Telling you your strengths and weaknesses is
good, but none of them that I have read have told you what to actually do to
minimize the weaknesses and use the strengths to their greatest advantage.
I hope to do this.  Let me be frank, Paladins are weaker generally in any
role until after level 22.  Playing a Paladin before this consists of
knowing how to use your strengths and minimize your weaknesses.  Some of
this is HEAVILY IMO, and could be disputed.  I don't cover how to act as a
Paladin here, as it would make this too long.
<p>
The basic strengths of the Paladin are A. The ability to save the day in a
way that no one else can with Lay Hands.  This is possibly the best ability
in the game. B.  The ability to provide backup healing/buffing. C. The
ability to Tank (which comes to full fruition at level 20), D. The ability
to (after level 15) be very effective against undead, and E. the ability to
solo pretty well.
<p>
The weaknesses are A. The ability to tank is not very good until level 20,
B. Leveling is *very* slow, and C. You do not get spells until relatively
late in your career.
<p>
<center><b>Starting as a Paladin</b></center>
<p>
Paladins need STR (for plate armor) and WIS (for mana) primarily.
<p>
I would say that an 85 STR is minimum to carry loot and wear armor (and even
then you will need buffing magics probably).  
<p>
Having less than a 90 or so WIS begins to degrade the primary benefit of a
Paladin, which is the healing/buffing/undead DD/Undead Lull ability.  If you
leave WIS at 60, why not just be a Warrior?
<p>
Racially, each choice has it's pros and cons.  I refer you to other guides
concerning races as they are much better than anything I could give you here
(eq.stratics.com for example).  I chose a High Elf for RP purposes, but a
Dwarf or Human are argueably the best choices.
<p>
-At level 1 drop 5 points into 1 handed slash. This isn't essential but it
gives you a nice headstart.
<p>
-At level 4 I dropped 10 points into tailoring and did not regret it (but I
wouldn't say this is necessary since you can buy Patchwork now for cheap.
Back then hardly anyone knew how to tailor).  If you don't you might want to
consider dropping some into 2 handed slash.
<p>
-At level 6 I drop 10 points into Sense Heading.  I guess you could build
this from nothing but it takes forever, and Sense Heading is *very*
valuable.  
<p>
-At level 8 drop 10 points into Taunt (otherwise it will go up VERY VERY
slowly, and this is a skill you need to capitolize on IMO).  
<p>
-At level 9 drop 1 point into Channeling, Divination, Alteration, and
Abjuration.
<p>
-At level 12, drop 1 point into Bash and Dodge, and a point into Meditate.
<p>
-At level 15, save yourself a LOT of frustration and drop at least 10 points
into Conjuration.  Hammer of Wrath costs 50 mana and is your first
Conjuration spell (i.e. you haven't built it up before now).  Building it
from base is hideously time consuming and wastes TONS of mana.  Also drop at
least 10 points into Evocation for Ward Undead if you can. 
<p>
-At level 17, drop 1 point into Parry.
<p>
-At level 20, drop 20 points into Double Strike. 
<p>
<center><b>Starting out.</b></center>
<p>
I would solo until level 5 at least since this will usually get you to where
you need to be the quickest.  No matter where you are, kill everything in
your path that will not hurt an important faction (like Pixie Tricksters for
example).  Stay near the guards if you need to run.  You should at a minimum
have full patchwork and a rusty weapon soon.  Most any Newbie zone is ok at
this level.  Build both 1 and 2 handed slash at these levels.  
<p>
Levels 5-9 are really hard.  You will need friends that will let you group
with then even though you hit less often and can't cast anything yet.  Many
powergamers will shun you (especially if you just used your Lay Hands) but
hopefully some will be impressed by your brevity (you are selfless and
willing to lay down your life to save another, right?).  When you get a
group of friends to adventure with, tank tank tank.  Build Taunt.  Try to
keep the monsters off everyone else, even if you are not the only tank.
Other players will appreciate this.  I always Taunt in combat unless I'm
under two bubbles of health.  Use your Lay Hands sparingly, but use it.
Don't hog it to yourself.  I almost never waste my Lay Hands to defeat a
tough monster I/we would otherwise not be able to kill.  Save it for when a
party member really needs it.  You will make a lot of friends this way.
Whenever I see a party member at less than a bubble in combat, I Lay On
them.  Your true usefulness now (and forever) is saving the day when no one
else can. Almost no class can save the day like you can at this level (and
none EVER in so dramatic a fashion).  If you waste your Lay Hands to solo a
tough monster, you will not be able to "save the day".  Misty Thicket is
where I was at this level, and I made out well there.  If you have the
patience, build 1 handed blunt.  This isn't necessary, but it will save you
time later.
<p>
An additional recommendation-Don't use a Minotaur Axe.  They are too slow
for you as the only attack you have, and without Kick or Dual Weild you
really pale in comparison to other tanks.  Try to get a regular/steel/fine
steel Longsword or Scimitar.  You hit almost twice as fast for just a few
points less damage per whack.  As a Paladin, this will work out better.
Trust me on this one.
<P>
Levels 9-12 are much better. You *finally* can heal and buff yourself, which
are lifesavers. I recommend you spend a level or so soloing at level 9 to
bring up your feeble magical skills (I did this in Misty Thicket on
gobs/spiders/wasps).  By level 10 you should be good to go and are ready to
be a more valuable asset to the group.  Continue doing what you were doing
before in groups, except now you can heal/cure disease/buff too.  By now you
should be making some decent cash.  Start saving for a Combine
Longsword/Scimitar and a Shiny Brass Shield.  I know you are hating that
newbie look by now, but you can live in leather armor until level 14-15 if
you need to.  Crushbone, Blackburrow, and Paw are good places for you at
this level.                
<P>
Levels 12-15 you get Bash, and I *HIGHLY* recommend you use it.  Don't
listen to people who say Bash is useless.  They are wrong when it comes to a
Paladin and Bash.  Bash may not be good for other classes, but it is VERY
good for you.  It's especially useful with a Shiny Brass shield since you
can Bash ghouls and such.  I bash on an average or 6-8 points per hit.
Complimented with a Combine weapon, you close the gap a little between those
dual weilding kicking fighters.  Still not as good, but much better.  I
developed 2 handed slash until this level, then dropped it (left it at 65 or
so) to use Bash.  It's still high enough to pick it up again later this way.
Meditate also makes the mana gain a lot faster, and Dodge is nice too.  Good
places for you now are Befallen and Unrest. 
<p>
Levels 15-17 You get spell upgrades (yay!).  Hammer of Wrath, Holy Armor,
Cure Disease, Ward Undead, all are great assests and against undead you are
a great benefit to any group.  If you don't have that shiny Combine yet,
Hammer of Wrath works just fine and is almost as good in fact.  I did not
build 1 handed blunt until level 13 or so, and it went up slowly to start
but it did go up.  Ward Undead is an awesome spell and is the most efficient
way to draw from distances and kill undead for you.  Once again, you may
want to solo a while to develop it.  I cannot over-emphasize it's utility
for you.  Alone I use it mainly draw and finish off undead, keeping a store
to heal myself in combat.  In groups I burn it all onto them and between
that and me hacking away I do a lot of damage.  
<p>
If you don't have a Combine sword (or Hammer of Wrath handy with good 1
handed blunt skill), Shiny Brass Shield, and at least partial
Banded/Ring/Chain armor, you need to make that top priority.  You need all
these IMO to do your job in a group.  You definitely go up a bunch of
notches on the usefulness scale at these levels, especially in places like
Unrest and Befallen.  I began to successfully lead and primary tank in
groups around this level.  
<p>
Levels 17-19  This is the final stretch for us brothers.  At 17 we get Parry
which is a great additon.  Not much else to say.   Your mana has gotten to
the point where you can do a very good amount of healing and dish out some
serious justice to undead.  From my observations, if you put stat points
where I told you to, you should have a ton of the blue stuff in comparison
to what your spells cost.  People actually start looking for Paladins now.
Unrest is still good but Befallen is probably too low level for you now.
You will do well anywhere, but I still recommend you stick to undead areas.
<p>
Levels 20-22, and beyond.  You made it.  You finally get Double Strike and
this closes the substantial gap between you and the Warrior in terms of
dishing out damage.  At this level your fighting ability is finally
comparable to the other tanks.  Level 22 Spells bring Root, Center, and
Invisibility to Undead (among others).  These are the just about the most
important spells you will ever get, especially Root.  You should already
have enough experience in the game to know what I mean by that.  I can't say
much about anything beyond this range, I can't see that far.
<p>
Soloing-Soloing is never really easy, and it's not nearly as much fun as
grouping, but so far as the ability to do it goes a Paladin is pretty good.
I have probably soloed about 4-5 levels in total (besides 1-5).  Paladins
are good at soloing mainly because after level 9 you can heal yourself
during combat instead of running when it gets hairy.  Really tough monsters
will interrupt you when casting, but whites and under usually will not
(depends).  With practice, you can become fairly adept at tabbing between
yourself and your target to heal.  Always keep buffs on, and pick a place
near a wall or corner.  This was you have 50%-75% less area to keep a watch
for monsters wanting to join your fight.  Of course, always have a clear
exit to run (preferably with guards).   I suggest you do NOT rely on Lay
Hands to beat tough monsters unless the payoff is enormous (like if you see
a monster carrying a great weapon or something).  This practice is good
once, but since you can't do it consistantly, it's not worth being screwed
later on because you used your Lay Hands.  When you solo, you need to take
single blues one after another as fast as possible with Lay Hands as a
backup.  You should not take one Yellow or Red per hour+half then blues
after that.   
<p>
The best thing to do is to run up, hit a single blue, then run back to your
cubby hole (drawing the monster back) to finish it at levels before 15.
Rinse and repeat.   This is the basic process for most any character.  At
level 15, if you solo undead you can stay in your cubby hole and draw single
undead to you with Ward Undead.  When doing this, conserve mana for healing.
Use one Ward Undead to draw then hold off and just melee it.  If it starts
going bad, heal yourself and duke it out.  If it goes well and the monster
flees, hit it with WU again so you don't have to follow and expose yourself
to more risk.  You can also use Lull Undead to take only a single monster
when there are two, although I rarely found this to be worth doing.  At
level 22 you get Root to make them stay put.  This is very important since
by then you will be doing more damage faster, and monsters will tend to flee
earlier and bring back really tough nasties if you let them.  Root is
essential to solo at later levels.
