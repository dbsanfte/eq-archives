&nbsp; &nbsp; Among the classes available in Everquest few are as charged with history and mystery as the Wizard class. 
Since the mighty Gandalf a wizard has epitomized mystery and power in countless fantasy works. That's why the prospect of 
role-playing a realistic wizard seems so appealing to so many.

&nbsp; &nbsp; The wizard is one of the most potent offensive forces in existence at the higher levels. Although certain classes 
(monks in particular) would be overwhelming to the Wizard up close, there is no class that can survive a potent wizard's wrath 
if he sees you first. In addition, at the higher levels, Wizards posses spells that can render them virtually impervious to climate, 
poison, and gift them with skin as hard as forged steel.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; All of this seems, perhaps, too good to be true. After all, who wouldn't want to be able to incinerate those who 
offend you from a great distance? But Verant has, in their quest for a balanced game, imposed quite a few restrictions upon the 
Wizard class. First and foremost are the physical limitations of the class. Following the logic that few are both mentally and 
physically potent Wizards are among the physically weakest of classes. Also, Wizards may not wear any form of significant 
armor (Wizards are restricted to cloth armor) and may not wield any but a few selected blunt weapons.

&nbsp; &nbsp; What does this boil down to? While the wizard at level 50 need fear few enemies (but don't kid yourself, there 
will ALWAYS be beasts that can kill you without breaking a sweat) it is a trying task to achieve so lofty a state. The purpose 
of this article is to help you, as the title implies, avoid some of my mistakes I made as a newbie, and "Get to Level 8 faster than 
I did."<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; I picked level 8 because this marks the second time in a young wizard's life that he has gained a new level of 
spells. At this point you will graduate from around 15 pts of damage per cast and move on to 45 pts or so. Also among the 
spells that become available is your second shield spell. Your greater offensive and defensive capabilities will open up new 
possibilities for you at this point. Furthermore, once you reach level 8, you don't need me to tell you how to run your 
character.<br>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Choosing a Race</b>:<br>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not all races may be a Wizard. The mental requirements eliminate several races immediately. That said you 
need to balance two considerations when choosing a race for your wizard: playability and power. Playability will determine how 
quickly you can level your character, and how easy it will be to play at lower levels. Humans and Erudites and High Elves 
would be among the easier to play; you will be less likely to be slaughtered by guards if you attempt to travel (which is 
important) and you will be able to more easily find a group to partner with.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Power takes into account the raw potency that your wizard will attain at higher levels. Erudites have the highest 
base intelligence, and therefore would be the most potent (assuming you put all your points into intelligence) at the higher levels. 
But the Dark Elves have nearly the same intelligence, with a slightly higher dexterity. Dexterity helps determine whether your 
spell will be interrupted when you are attacked while casting, and a higher dexterity may be a large aid at lower levels (and 
higher ones, too.)

&nbsp; &nbsp; I chose the Dark Elf, but you must decide what you consider more important, power or playability. Remember 
that if you level faster you will be potent, so don't agonize too much over your decision.<br>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Creating your Character:</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I'm going to assume you are basically familiar with the character creation in Everquest. Since Intelligence 
determines how much Mana you will have, and how potent your spells are, Adding all or most of your points to intellect makes 
good sense. A few points to dexterity would be a good idea too, because, as I mentioned before, this will possibly save your 
life on more than one occasion. If you cant cast your new, potent spell, then the monster is likely to kill you.<br>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>What to do first:</b><br>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If you have ever read a tutorial on Everquest character creation you know that your character will have, among 
other things, a note for your guild master. Your first task should be to locate your guild and give the note to your guild master. 
This will give you exp and something to help you on your way. If you have trouble locating your guild, try a /shout. In my 
experience there are always a few people around who will help a newbie out. After you have equipped the items you received 
from your guild master and the weapon you had on you when you were "born" you are ready to set out.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Your first kill:</b><br>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Many newbies ask "where is the newbie area?" The simple answer is there is no newbie area. Everywhere you 
go, unless a guard is standing right next to you (and sometimes even then) you can, and most likely will be, killed. Your task is 
to kill the weakest enemies you can find without straying too far from the guards. Depending on your area you will find different 
enemies that you may kill at this point; /con everything by right clicking on it, and only attack even fights or below.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Basic strategy:</b><br>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A wizard was never intended to fight alone, particularly at the lower levels. Attempting to range about, 
wreaking havoc at level 4 will inevitably lead you to an early death. It is, therefore, of utmost importance to form groups with 
other, sturdier, characters as often as possible. You will need a "tank" to hold the monster at bay while you are free to cast 
away. Even splitting the exp in this manner will bring you to higher levels faster than going solo, I promise. Once you have been 
in the game a while you will develop friendships with players that you work well with, and you will group with them often. Until 
that happens you can try a /shout, or do a /who and /tell to individuals enquiring about grouping.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Becoming more powerful:</b><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course the best way to get stronger is to increase in level. But there are ways to maximize your strength at 
the level you are at. Your skills will only increase to a finite point for each level, but why should you wait until you are nearly to 
the next level before you max out your skills? Practice your spells on yourself, pausing to regain mana whenever you run out, 
and you will find your magical talents improving quickly. The other, equally important area you need to increase as quickly as 
possible is your ac, or armor class. You need to purchase as many items of cloth armor that you can as quickly as possible. 
While it may be true that the best defense is a good offense, before level 8 or so you don't have much of an offense. You need 
to increase your defense if you wish to live. Lastly, the best favor you can do for yourself is to spend a little money on a staff 
and ditch the dagger. A staff has better range and will do more damage. Save up two gold or so and find yourself a cheap 2HB 
staff. You will be far more potent and will therefore level faster.<br>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Making money:</b><br><P>
<ol>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Having stated the importance of armor it should be mentioned that armor is expensive. Purchasing all the armor 
you can obtain before level 8 will require 3 or 4 platinum at least. Indeed, to obtain all of your spells that you will need by level 
8, and your armor, and a better weapon, you will need around 25 to 30 Platinum. That is, I know, a large amount of money. 
So how do you do it? The answer is that there is no quick and easy way to make cash as a young wizard. The beasts you will 
be able to kill will not have on them items that will make you rich. There are some strategies you can employ, howerer.
<p>
<li> Buy a backpack. Save up the 4gp or so that they cost and get yourself a backpack as soon as possible. The extra space will 
allow you to loot longer without needing to return to town, saving you time.</li>
<p>
<li>Be adamant that your group splits loot fairly, and always have the /auto split set to yes for the group. Don't get greedy, 
however, and try to hog the loot (or secretly turn off the auto split on yourself) because the last thing you need is for your 
friends to get angry with you. (See the section on the importance of grouping.) A good method for loot splitting is alphabetical, 
but whatever method your group settles on, speak up and make sure its fair.</li>
<p>
<li>At higher levels you will be able to hunt enemies such as skeletons that don't give you the best exp possible, but are very 
profitable. I've made 5 or 6 plat in a single evening just standing where the skeletons generate and slaughtering. (This is also a 
good tactic if you cant find a group - kill low level creatures for low exp, but make money. It will pay off in the end.)</li>
<p>
<li>Several skills can be real money makers. Spend a few practice points on one or two that catch your eye and you can rake in 
the platinum when you become skilled at it. A full set of Banded armor can gross 100pp or more (of course it would take you 
quite some time to become skilled enough to create this armor.) Fishing is also a good source of revenue you can use to fill the 
time while waiting for your friends to log on.</li>
</ol>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Practice Points:</b><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Practice points can be a real life saver in the early points of your development as a young wizard. Using them 
to increase your skill with your knife or staff can help you survive and thrive as a young wizard. In a solo situation your skill with 
a weapon will be vital since your spells will be interrupted and will fizzle often. But I don't recommend that you use them to 
increase your skills in the various magic realms. If you follow my advice and repeatedly cast your spells each time you reach a 
new level you will come to their maximum level for the Level you have just reached. In this way you can save up a large number 
of points for other skills, such as blacksmithing, and make large amounts of money.<br>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Well, there you have it. All my wisdom (if you can call it that) distilled here for your playing pleasure. I hope 
you find these tips useful, and use them to avoid the mistakes I made on my way to level 8. Good luck and I'll see you in 
Norrath!<br>
