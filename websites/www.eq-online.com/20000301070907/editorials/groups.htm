Everquest is a group game.  Yes, we have all heard this somewhere before.  Which is fine, Verant wanted to keep player interaction in Everquest and made it a group oriented game.
For the most part.  Some people wish to solo, which is also fine.  Now you group fanatics may wonder why this is.  Let me ask you this, have you ever been in a group where one person loots out of turn, joins your group and does nothing, 
pulls things that end up getting the whole party killed except the puller who for some reason almost always lives (my personal favorite).
<p>
Is it any wonder why some people prefer to solo rather than put up with stuff like this?  I have had my own personal bad experiences with groups and group with very few people now, basically the ones I trust.
And finding a good group if your friends aren't on can be a grueling task.  The whole concept of a group oriented game is great.  But one thing Verant didn't account for was the human factor.  It's sad really, there are many people who play the game that are really nice people.
But there seems to always be a bad apple in the bunch, no matter where you go.  If I gave you examples of all the crap I have seen in Everquest this editorial would be huge.  
<p>
I can however give everyone who reads this the rules I live by when grouping.  Here's a list:
<ul>
<li>Dont take a known killstealer</li><p>
Alot of these kill stealers out there say they are kill stealing because they can not get into a group, cry me a river, if you cant get into a group is no reason to kill steal.
They are playing on the "if you cant beat them join them" idea.  If you cant compete with the kill stealer, let them join.  I can't begin to tell you how much of a problem I have with this.
These people need to learn that training people and kill stealing will NOT be tolerated.  It's the only way they are gonna learn.  I train kill stealers every chance I get, or cast a spell on them as I am running to the zone from a train, so it heads back after them.
I dont recommend you do this of course, but this is what I do.
<p>
<li>What to do when someone loots out of turn</li><p>
Warn em, then boot them.  It's that simple, if you have a designated loot order and someone repeatedly breaks it, dont put up with it.
I saw this in unrest alot when I was there at around 20th.  When a special monster was pulled i.e. Knight, Hand, etc.  I found people looting out of turn.
To get whats on these particular mob's.  Just a note to all of you the hand, barkeep and knight always drop something, in the case of the hand it sometimes drops a book.
But if someone loots out of turn and loots a knight or barkeep, and says they had nothing they are lying, those two mob's always drop magic items, always.  You will also quite likely get the lamers who
blame this on mouse look, tell em to turn it off.
<p>
<li>Getting a bad puller</li><p>
If someone is pulling for the group and starts pulling things the group cannot handle and you end up repeatedly zoning, find a new puller.
I have pulled with another character of mine, all I asked for was a SoW and then I would pull.  Now a good puller will know when he has pulled to much and zone it so as to not harm the group.
A bad puller will just /gsay Incoming and drag a bunch of crap right to the group, leaving you no choice but to fight or watch the puller die.
And a good puller always knows what his group can handle, a bad puller doesn't care he is thinking about the exp award IF he can convince the group to take on things they cant kill.
Know your puller...best advice I can give ya.
<p>
<li>Playing with smart players</li><p>
If you need an explanation of this let me ask you if you have ever been in a group where a cleric had mana and you died.  No reason if the cleric/healer in your group has mana that you should have died.
This is an example of what I am talking about.  And this does to some extent come with experience.  The longer you play the more you will notice mistakes that someone or even you made that could have been avoided.
For the most part you also want to look for a well balanced group, which I could give many examples of.  Your healer should concentrate on keeping the tanks healed.  The tanks whether they be warriors, rangers or whatever are your strong front line troops.
If they go down, you will most likely be soon to follow, this is especially true the higher level you get.  Where non-tank types dont last long against mob's.
<p>
This has kind of turned out to be more of a guide to grouping rather than an editorial..but maybe that isnt bad.
Here's some more information on grouping.
<p>
</ul>
<center><font face="helvetica" size=3><b>A well balanced group</b></font></center><br>
<p>
Verant did a very good job of creating different types of classes and giving groups a wide possible range of abilities available.
This has to some extent been ignored, I personally look for a well balanced group which could contain almost any class as long as the group is balanced well.
Your opinion may differ from mine but these have been the best for me.  When I play my necromancer, the two classes I look for most in groups are a Bard, or Druid.
And the reason is simple, Druids are great all purpose classes.  They can cast evacuate spells, saving your party from death, they can also cast regeneration at higher levels on the party which will allow
the whole party to heal and lets you lose little if no health while you cast Call of bones, or any other mana regen/health degen spell.
<p>
Bards are just a great class period, they can fear, charm, get a mana regeneration song at 31st or so and just make a great addition to any group.
But enough about my personal choices.  The roles of classes in groups are pretty simple.  Clerics/Druids/Shamans buff and heal.  Wizards/Mages/Necro's/Enchanters nuke or cast beneficial magic.
Tanks just tank.  I though it was interesting the other day when I made a cleric and started grouping at a low level.
<p>
The people I grouped with were SURPRISED to be getting healed and buffed.  They could not beleive that I was actually healing them.  Whats wrong with that picture?
Worse yet, a couple of the party members actually bitched me out for not tanking!  Like I was a fighter!  Completely ignoring the fact that the tank would have died more than once if not for the fact that I was burning all my mana healing him.
After all he is the tank!  Now one problem with me tanking...if someone needs a heal, I will most likely be knocked out of casting if fighting.
<p>
Probably resulting in someone dying.  Which was the point I argued with the group, even worse one of the members that was pissed I did not tank booted me out, even as the fighter complained (he liked getting the heals).
The two guys that were upset with me for not tanking will learn as they progress in levels that the cleric is not a tank, they can and do run interference sometimes, but for the most part are not tanks.
But this is where experience comes into play, at a lower level the cleric can be an effective tank.  But that soon changes.
<p>
The above was just an example of a classes role in a group, sometimes it is not clearly defined, but do yourself a favor and look for a well balanced group, one that offers many different benefits and can kick some ass.
Well thats my thoughts on Grouping, and trust me, the higher level you get the more your role in a group is defined.  Just be sensible about how you play your class, give your group every possible advantage.
And use your skills!  Clerics heal the tanks, Tanks taunt that monster of the mages, Mages dont burn your mana on one mob when fighting four.  As always I welcome comments.
