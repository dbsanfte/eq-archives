<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=167 HEIGHT=254 SRC="d_erollisi_marr.gif"><font face="helvetica" size=2>Followers of Erollisi Marr cling to the belief that love

 conquers all. It should be pointed out that while love is a

 generally peaceful concept, Erollisi worshippers are not

 pacifists. They would like to live in a world where everyone

 loves everyone else and violence does not exist but they

 are not naïve enough to think that Norrath is that world.

 They have passionate loves of people, places and ideas

 and are more than willing to fight and die to preserve those

 things. The dream of every follower of Erollisi is to die in

 selfless defense of someone or something they love. Many

 Paladins hear the true calling of their hearts and follow

 Erollisi Marr.
