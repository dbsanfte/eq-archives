<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=167 HEIGHT=254 SRC="d_brell_serilis.gif"></IMG><font face="helvetica" size=2>Followers of Brell Serilis believe that the surface world is a

 waste of space. They find true happiness in the caves,

 caverns and tunnels that perforate the belly of Norrath. But

 this is one of few points that all followers of Brell can agree

 upon. There are many different factions who all worship

 Brell. The Runny Eye Clan of Goblins claim he is their

 father much to the disgust of the Dwarves of Kaladim who

 know that the Dwarves are the true children of Serilis. But

 the vicious Gnolls of Split Paw disagree entirely. For was it

 not Brell who sculpted them out of the sacred Clay of

 Cosgrove? Followers of Brell Serilis in one form or another

 can be found nearly anywhere you enter the Underfoot of

 Norrath.
