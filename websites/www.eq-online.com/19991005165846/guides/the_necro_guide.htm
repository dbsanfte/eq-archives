<i>Aboslute power corrupts absolutely</i>
<p>
And there is no greater power than that of a skilled Necromancer, make no mistakes, and do not be fooled by the pathetic weaklings that would have you believe that Necromancy is a feeble practice.
Such lies are spread by the fearful, jealous masses that seek to discredit and ultimately destroy the Necromancers.  They are however wise to fear us, no magic user on Norrath is more feared, or more respected than the 
Necromancer.  If you do choose to follow this path, make no mistake it shall be a difficult one.  There are many places where Necromancers are unwelcome and usually attacked.  But that is the price you pay for wielding such awesome
power.  Masters of the dead, Necromancers practice a dark, ancient magic that has been on the face of Norrath since its inception.
<p>
I write this tome to aid those who would seek this power, and join there brothers and sisters of the darkness.  The goal of an apprentice Necromancer should be to master giving commands to his or her undead pet.
This is the key to winning or losing a battle.  Many young fools have met their end by not fully understanding how to use this undead servant to its full advantage.
<p>
All the guilds across Norrath shall give you two scrolls in which to start your career, these are the spells <i>Life tap</i> and <i>Minor shielding</i>.  Scribe these spells, they may not seem like much, but they are very effective to the young 
apprentice.  Once you have added this ancient knowledge to your spellbook, you must go forth and practice these incantations, and earn the money you will need to buy some other spells from your guild.
The one you should be most concerned with is <i>Cavorting Bones</i>.  This is your first pet.  And he should serve you well.  Many young Necromancers have found that giving this first servant a weapon to wield is very effective, this is a good idea, it will increase 
the damage your servant does in combat.
<p>
Depending on how you wish to perform in combat you may consider a few other spells of the first circle.  These are <i>Disease cloud</i> and <i>Siphon Strength</i>.  I have always been a very offensive Necromancer, maximizing the damage I deal an opponent is my highest priority.
I give them a quick and usually very painful death.  You may wish to take a different route than I, so be it.  But apprentice, let me tell you more about these spells, <i>Life Tap</i> was created by an unknown Necromancer during the Age of Scale.  This Necromancer found the secret to tapping the 
life forces of his victims and adding them to his own.  Accomplishing two things, healing you and damaging your foe.  He created several different levels of this spell, each one more damaging than the last.  <i>Disease Cloud</i> is a very affective spell indeed.  Created by Ternin Moxx under the tutilage of the Master Necromancer 
Ivin.  This spell hinders your foe from healing and also deals a blow at the time of casting, the damage is not that great but the fact that your opponent will not heal while under the effect of this spell makes it a very useful tool.
<p>
<i>Cavorting Bones</i> is one of the many conjuring spells a Necromancer gets.  It will require bone fragments from a skeleton, any skeleton should do.  As the spell is cast the bone chips are placed into the ground and a servant rises forth.
<i>Siphon Strength</i> this spell steals the strength of your foe and adds it to your own.  No more needs to be said.  As you increase in levels you will notice that your pet becomes increasingly weaker and feeble.  Do not fret, as soon as you attain the 4th level of Necromancy you shall accquire a new spell for summoning servants.
But until you reach the 4th level, your pet should serve you well.
<p>
The other spells of the first circle are fairly self explanatory, if you cannot understand there functions merely by looking at there names you should consider taking up another career, such as a mage, or wizard, this lot is full of fools like you.
My guess is that you will understand what they do so I will continue.  At the 4th level of Necromancy a few new and interesting incantations become available to the apprentice.  But I shall only mention those that I found effective in my travels.
<P>
These spells are <i>Clinging Darkness</i> which I used quite often when I was an apprentice, this spells slows an opponent and damages them as it does.  This spell is effective and with your target slowed and taking damage your pet can chase it down and kill it with relative ease.
<i>Grim Aura</i> this spell allows you to increase your melee attack skill/stat for a brief period, I found it useless, but I mention it nonetheless.  <i>LifeSpike</i> the continuation of the Life tap spell, this is a slightly more powerful version of the Life tap spell.
<i>Gate</i> only a foolish Necromancer does not have this spell, it has saved my life more times than I can count.  <i>Leering Corpse</i> your 4th level servant spell, as promised.  This servant can be of varying levels, but never higher than your own level.
<i>Poison Bolt</i> hail the effects of poison, I used this often, poisoning a foe and watching it run thinking it had got away only to die minutes later.  <i>Fear</i> this spell has a few uses, it seems resisted often, and even if successful the foe it is cast on returns to pummel you after its effects wear off.
This spell is however good for a quick escape, should you need to flee.  <i>Numb the Dead</i> this spell commands undead to give you the respect you deserve, making them docile and ambivolent.
<p>
I should mention how important it is to consider each opponent carefully.  Many shop keepers, innkeepers, merchants, and guards across Norrath would like the chance to cut down a Necromancer.  Consider everyone an enemy until you know otherwise.
Soon you will attain the 8th level of Necromancy, this is where your power really starts to show.  You receive at this level some very potent incantations.  The more useful being <i>Ward Undead</i> this spell is a direct assault on undead beings.
As Necromancers we weild power over the undead and control them for the most part, there are however undead out there that do not recognize our power, that is why this spell was created we send these inferior undead back to hell with this spell.
<i>Lesser Shielding</i> this spell not only adds to your hit points but also add to your resistance against an opponents magic.  <i>Mend Bones</i> besides the ability to destroy undead we also have the power to heal them.
Mend bones will heal undead, but mainly should be used on your servant.  <i>Gather Shadows</i> one of the Necromancers best freinds, this spell allows you to walk unseen amongst the masses.  The duration is random, remember this.
<i>Dark Empathy</i> I have no idea what weak hearted fool created this spell but nonetheless I shall mention it here, this spell takes your life and gives it to another person.
Kind of a reverse life tap if you will.  <i>Shadow Step</i> an interesting spell that teleports you to a random location in the area you inhabit.  Can be very confusing.
<i>Bone Walk</i> this is your 8th level servant spell.  Once you reach higher levels of Necromancy around 9th or 10th you will ocasionally see a stronger pet summoned with this spell.
If you can manage to summon a pet of 9th level he will attack and bash opponents.
<p>
At 8th level there is no need to give your servant a weapon anymore, your servant is now fairly strong and a weapon would only hinder it in combat.  With your new found power against the undead you can fight skeletons even ones that might be a gamble with relative ease.
Some good tactics to use are mana burn or tank, Mana burn is simple, throw your pet on the skeleton and cast Ward undead until the skeleton is dead.  This "burns" your mana, obviously.
Or the tank method in which you let your pet tank the skeleton and you stand back and heal him with your new found Mend bones spell.
<P>
At the 12th level of Necromancy you get some very powerful spells, this is where your power really starts to show, You get your first Damage over Time spell, <i>Heat Blood</i>.  This spell does 16 points of damage every round for 10 rounds, roughly doing 
160 points of damage at its end, combine it with Engulfing darkness and your target has not a prayer.  The pet you get at this level is also more powerful able to hit creatures that could only normally be affected by magical weapons.
<p>
Now you are armed with some knowledge of Necromancy, go forth into the world and spread the word.  Necromancers shall rule again, it is only a matter of time.......
