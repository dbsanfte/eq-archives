<td><font face="helvetica" size=2>Welcome to the Unofficial Everquest F.A.Q.  We put this FAQ together because as a day to day part of our operations here we are asked 

many questions both on our message board and more frequently through email.  So we have compiled a list of the questions we have seen the most and/or the best questions asked of us 

since 12-21-98 when this site was founded.  Below we will provide answers to these questions.

</tr>

<tr>

<td><font face="helvetica" size="2" color="white">A. Combat is initiated for the most part by you, the player.  In some 

circumstances the monster attacks you first and then you need to go into "combat" or "Auto attack" mode.  The default key for auto attack is A. 

We suggest switching this to Z, for the simple reason that if you go to say something and did not hit the enter key hard enough you will go into attack mode, 

this can be particularily nasty if you have a guard targeted at the time.  Once you hit the auto attack key, whether A or Z or whatever you tell the game you want it to be

you will attack whatever is currently targeted.  And a small box will flash in the upper right hand corner to let you know you are in auto attack mode.</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><font face="helvetica" size="2" color="white">A. You can log out at anytime.  But unless you camp (which you cant do if you are getting beat on by a monster) your character will stay in the 

game for a short amount of time.  The bottom line is if you bit off more than you could chew by attacking something that is alot higher level than you, the best thing to do is try to get someone to help, or run.

Alot of times running can be worse than just standing and facing your fate.  Running turns your back to the monster and increases their chance of "Stunning" you.  In Everquest, if your think you are going to die because you 

have either taken on something to powerful for your level, or have been ambushed by more than a few things, the best thing to do is go out fighting.  You might even take one with you.

</tr>

<tr>

<td><font face="helvetica" size="2" color="white">A. Yes, you can group in Everquest.  Groups are currently limited to six people but this gives you plenty of members of the group that can do different things.

Ideally you should have a "tank", who is usually a warrior or some other high hit point class that takes most of the damage while the rest of the party beats on whatever you are fighting, clerics in a group are ALWAYS a good 

idea do to their ability to heal and "buff" the characters in the party, rogues at higher levels can backstab and cause some serious damage to what you fight, so as you can see everyones has a definable role in a party and every class

can be successful in a group atmosphere.  To create a group find other players who are near your level, target them and hit the invite command.  If they accept you will form the group.  Your party window on the right side of the screen will 

be updated to show you the health of your group members, this can be very useful if someone who is not in your current view is under attack, you can also default your chat window to tell specifically to the group.

<td><font face="helvetica" size="2" color="white"><b>Q. How bad is the lag in the game?</b></font></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><font face="helvetica" size="2" color="white">A. This is a tough question, there were some times in the beta that I thought I was under some heavy lag, but looked down at the "lag meter" and realized that what I was experiencing was not 

internet lag but what us beta testers called "video lag".  Video lag can be annoying, if you get tons of people on the screen at the same time casting spells, fighting, etc.  Your graphics update will slow down, you wont move very fast, but the rest of the 

game is moving at normal speed, it can be very annoying.  And happens even to those with higher end video cards/machines.  But more rarely.

video cards and hardware they have tested in the game.

</tr>

<tr>

<td><font face="helvetica" size="2" color="white">A. Yes, many different views, and you will learn to use the one that best fits the situation.  

An example would be in Kelethin, the wood elf city, there are a lot of places to fall of the platforms in the city and fall to your death.  Some of the ramps in the city 

can be hard to see in first person, it is a good idea to switch the view to something like overhead view to see where exactly that ramp is.

</tr>

<tr>

<td><font face="helvetica" size="2" color="white">A. Well I can't vouch for the PVP server but on the normal servers, no, not unless you are +PVP.  If you are -PVP which means you have not decided to follow the 

ways of chaos, then you are safe from looters, and being PK'd.  NO ONE can loot, kill, or steal from you.  On the other hand you can "consent" someone to loot your corpse, giving them permission to loot your corpse.

You should only have a freind or someone you trust do this though.

<tr>
<td><font face="helvetica" size="2" color="white">A. In some ways it is like D&D yes.  You do have to scribe spells into a spellbook before you memorize them, and must memorize them before you cast them.  We have 
some <a href="http://www.eq-online.com/tutorial/">tutorial</a> information on how to do this.  As far as weapon specializations, in a way they do yes.  You increase skill in certain types of weapons, for instance if you had a character that used 
a mace as their primary weapon, they would increase their One handed blunt weapon skill.  Since the mace utilizes the One handed weapon skill.  And yes you do need experience to gain levels.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><font face="helvetica" size="2" color="white">A. The Autosplit function is an option that you turn on, it divides up the money equally between your party members.  In beta it also divided it up if you died and went back to get the stuff off your corpse, not sure if that still 
happens but for safety's sake might want to turn it off before you loot your corpse.</td>

<tr>
<td><font face="helvetica" size="2" color="white">A. Considering or "conning" as it was called by beta testers, means to size up an opponent.  If you see a monster that you are not sure you are
ready for or not target it and hit the "C" key.  It will give you a message.  We will have a list up of these messages soon, basically from what the message says you can determine whether it would be 
suicide for you to try to defeat the thing or not.</td>

<tr>
<td><font face="helvetica" size="2" color="white">A. Depends on what you mean by good?  We noticed in the beta the monsters generally went after:
<ul>
<li>The weakest character</li>
<li>The most wounded character</li>
<li>The lowest level character</li>
<li>Any spellcasters/healers</li>
</ul>
<br>
Plus the fact that if the monsters has gotten one of your party members down to very low hit points there is a very slim chance that you will be able to 
"taunt" it off of that character or distract it in any way, it smells blood, and knows that the character is near death.  And usually wont stop until that character is dead 
or the beast is.</td>

<td><font face="helvetica" size="2" color="white">A. Ouch! This answer may be a tad long.  Ok, here is the basics.  Sometimes when you greet an NPC they respond to you and in their response there are words that 
are in brakets like this [what a fine day].  This is where you need to ad-lib a bit and say something like "You think it is a fine day?" or "Yes it is a fine day!".  It takes some practice but eventually you 
will say something that gets another reaction out of the NPC.  And a quest unfolds.</td>
