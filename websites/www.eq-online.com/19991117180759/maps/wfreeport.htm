<p>
Freeport is a very busy city, filled with intrigue, danger, and a number of different races.
There are a number of interesting places to visit while in Freeport.  In West Freeport you have a variety of guilds and a few shops.
As well as the Headquarters of the Freeport Militia.  
<P>
1. <b>Steel Warriors Bunker</b> - This is the Warriors guild of Freeport, The Steel Warriors.  They operate the Arena in Freeport (Area 2).
The Steel warriors are concerned first and foremost with the protection of Freeport, and seek the destruction of the Deathfist clan Orcs.
To see maps of the guildhouse and descriptions of the NPC's within, click <a href="steelwarrior.htm">here</a>.
<p>
2. <b>The Arena</b> - The Arena is the place to go if you have a dispute over something.  It is a PvP area and you will be warned when you enter it.
It is safer to take conflicts to this arena rather than dueling in another part of the city as guards often get involved.  From the arena the Freeport Jail (Area 12) is readily accessible.
<p>
3. <b>Freeport Militia House</b> - The Freeport Militia is a rough, military type faction who beleive that Freeport is theirs to control.
Their leader Sir Lucan Dlere is the self-proclaimed ruler over Freeport.  While it is disputed among many other factions in the city, none have directly opposed his claim to power as of yet.
A bitter war could break at anytime between the Freeport Militia and thier rivals, the Temple of Marr, and the Knights of Truth.  Who often employ the services of adventurers to kill Freeport Militia Guards.
To see maps of the Freeport Militia house and descriptions of the NPC's there, click <a href="militia.htm">here</a>.
<p>
4. <b>Smithson's Weaponry</b> - Smithson's weapons rumored to be the best weapon for the price.  This shop sells your basic steel weapons along with anything else they come across from adventurers.
The owners of the shop are true business men often overlooking religious differences, to make the sale.
<p>
5. <b>Hogcallers Inn</b> - Necromancers, Shadow Knights and clerics who serve evil gods should steer clear of the Hogcaller Inn.
There are regulars there that tend to take a dim view of those that serve evil deities.  Lady Shae is one such resident, she will attack Shadow Knights on sight, and glowers dubiously at Necromancers.
Necromancers, instead of being attacked by Lady Shae will be assualted by Hyrill Pon, another resident who shares no love for dark arts.
If you can enter the Inn without being killed, then you will find it is a haven for rumors and a decent place to spend the night.
<p>
6. <b>Academy of Arcane Science</b> - The Academy of Arcane science caters to Magicians, Enchanters, Wizards, and Druids.  Offering a wide range of spells on scroll, the Academy is an interesting place to visit.
With a teleporter in and back out, it is somewhat of a tourist attraction in Freeport.
<p>
7. <b>Theatre of Tranquil</b> - Perhaps they call it this because it is so quiet?  This is a popular place in the spring when many bards and actors come out to make use of the stage.
<p>
8. <b>Locked Building</b> - No one really knows what is in this locked building...
<p>
9. <b>The Ashen Order</b> - This is where young monks come to train and earn their headbands, this is one of only two monks guilds on the face of Norrath.
<p>
10. <b>Torlig's Herbs & Medicines</b> - The name says it all, if your looking for something no one else has, dont forget to stop by Torlig's.
<p>
11. <b>Empty Building</b> - An empty building.
