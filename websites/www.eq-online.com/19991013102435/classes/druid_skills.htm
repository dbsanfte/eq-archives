<center><b><font face="helvetica" size="3">Skills for the Druid Class</font></b></center>

<p>

The Druid has a wide range of spell casting abilities.  And decent melee abilities.

<p>

<ul>

<li><b>One handed blunt</b></li>

<br>

This is your skill in one handed blunt weapons.  Weapons such as the mace, club, etc.

<p>

<li><b>One handed Slashing</b></li>

<br>

This is your skill in one handed slashing weapons.  Due to druidic beliefs the only slashing weapon you may use as a druid is a scimitar.

<p>

<li><b>Evocation</b></li>

<br>

Your skill in spells that utilize Evoking.

<p>

<li><b>Two handed blunt</b></li>

<br>

This is your skill in two handed blunt weapons.  Weapons such as Great staff, two-handed hammer, etc.

<p>

<li><b>Alteration</b></li>

<br>

Your skill in spells that utilize Altering.

<p>

<li><b>Bind Wound</b></li>

<br>

This skill stops a comrade from bleeding to death, it requires bandages, but can save a life.  When you drop below

your total hit points, you go unconcious, a party member must act fast to prevent you from bleeding to death.

<p>

<li><b>Defense</b></li>

<br>

This is your natural defense, your skill at avoiding blows this skill combines with Dodge to boost your overall defense against 

attacks.  This skill when improved slightly increases your Armor Class.  Note that this is your "natural" armor class, thus if you 

were to not wear armor, this would not lower the bonus provdided by this skill.

<p>

<li><b>Abjuration</b></li>

<br>

Your skill in spells that utilize Abjuring.

<p>

<li><b>Conjuration</b></li>

<br>

Your skill in spells that utilize Conjuring.

<p>

<li><b>Hand-to-Hand</b></li>

<br>

Hand-to-Hand combat is fighting with no weapon.  Bards will utilize this if they are using an instrument in 

one oe both hands and need to fight.

<p>

<li><b>Offense</b></li>

<br>

Like Defense, this skill raises your "natural" offensivness, meaning it raises your attack number and this bonus would still 

be there if you unequiped whatever weapon you are using.

<p>

<li><b>Piercing</b></li>

<br>

This is your skill in piercing weapons.  Weapons such as Spear, Dagger, etc.

<p>

<li><b>Sense Heading</b></li>

<br>

This skill allows you to sense which direction you are heading.

<p>

<li><b>Divination</b></li>

<br>

Your skill in spells that utilize Divining.

<p>

<li><b>Swimming</b></li>

<br>

This is your ability to swim and to hold your breath for longer periods of time.

<p>

<li><b>Throwing</b></li>

<br>

This is your skill in thrown weapons.  Weapons such as Throwing axe, Shuriken, etc.

<p>

<li><b>Fishing</b></li>

<br>

Your skill in fishing determines how many failures you have before actually catching a fish, it also should help 

you avoid breaking your fishing pole.

<p>

<li><b>Baking</b></li>

<br>

Your ability to bake things.

<p>

<li><b>Tailoring</b></li>

<br>

Very useful for a beginning bard, you can take wolf pelts and make patchwork armor out of them.

Patchwork is almost as good as leather, and if you get a blacksmith you can also add studs to your 

patchwork armor making Studded leather.

<p>

<li><b>Smithing</b></li>

<br>

As mentioned above this is your ability to shape steel or other metals into useful objects, like lantern cases, 

studs for leather armor, even metal armor.

<p>

<li><b>Fletching</b></li>

<br>

This is your ability to make arrows.  There are a wide range of materials you can use to make arrows, these will be 

listed under a different section.

<p>

<li><b>Brewing</b></li>

<br>

Your ability to brew alcoholic beverages, yeah!!

<p>

<li><b>Alcohol Tolerance</b></li>

<br>

Your ability to avoid adverse affects of alcohol.

<p>

<li><b>Beg</b></li>

<br>

This is a skill all races get, use this with extreme caution NPC's will kill you if you beg from them to much, 

or some if you beg from them at all!  So use this cautiuosly, I have heard reports of NPC's giving away some very cool 

things as a result of begging though.

<p> 

<li><b>Jewelcraft</b></li>

<br>

Not much is known about this skill, make jewelry from rocks?  No one knows, if you do find out 

let us know :)

<p>

<li><b>Pottery</b></li>

<br>

Makes pots, jugs, vases, etc.  This is your ability at making these.

<p>

<li><b>Common Tongue</b></li>

<br>

All of the three races that a Bard can be get this skill.  Common tongue is the common language of 

Norath.

<p>

</ul>
