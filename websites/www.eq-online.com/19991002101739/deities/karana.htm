<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=167 HEIGHT=254 SRC="d_karana.gif"><font face="helvetica" size=2>Followers of Karana believe in the absolute power of

 storms. They worship the life giving power of the rain and

 respect the destructive force of a sandstorm or hurricane.

 Typical followers of Karana are rural humaniods, farmers,

 ranchers, hunters, and the like. They will often offer shelter

 from the elements to strangers. Many Karana followers live

 a nomadic lifestyle, travelling where the winds take them.

 They are humble, generous people who value strength and

 honesty and brook no disrespect of Karana and his work

 for they know it is only through his wisdom and kindness

 that all of Norrath is not consumed in an eternal tempest.
