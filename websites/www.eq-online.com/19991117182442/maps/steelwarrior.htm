<b>Level 1</b><br>This level holds many of the trainers of the Steel Warriors guild in it.  The steel warriors are always looking for novice and veteran warriors to perform 
tasks in service to the guild.  The guild house also has it's own personal forge that apprentice blacksmiths can use.
<p>
1. <b>Plagus Ladeson</b> Plagus Ladeson is originally from Qeynos, he came to Freeport to become a Blademaster for the Steel Warriors.
He gives new recruits tasks to be completed and will also train them.  And he is quite smiten with Toala.
<p>
2. <b>Larn Brugal</b> Larn Brugal will greet you, but don't expect much beyond that from this seasoned warrior.
<p>
3. <b>Brina Foxtripper</b> When hailed Brina has very little if anything to say, she is quite shy, for a warrior anyways.
<p>
4. <B>Brena Donyld</b> Brena, it seems, doesnt have much to say either...
<p>
5. <b>Joffin Sinclay</b> Joffin is a bit gruff, but what warrior isnt?
<p>
6. <b>Tyeg Envill</b> Tyeg is the resident merchant at the Steel Warriors bunker, he buys and sells many things, mostly weapons.
<p>
<img src="steel2.jpg" width="300" height="300" align="left">
<b>Level 2</b><p>On this level you will find Cain Darkmoore, the Guild Master of the Steel Warriors.
<p>
7. <b>Cain Darkmoore</b> Distressed by the Deathfist orcs so close to the gates of Freeport, Cain just might offer you a reward to clean things up.
