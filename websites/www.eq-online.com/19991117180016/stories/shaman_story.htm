You awake with a rush of cold air blowing down your spine.  Every hair on your body stands on end, even you are not used to these cold winds.  It seems more then just cold air on this night, it seems like a warning of some sort.  It is not the first one though, for you had not slept well all night either.  Visions of many deaths, many deaths of fellow tribesmen.  But one person is missing from these deaths, you.  You pass aside these thoughts, they must just be your nerves on edge.  Besides that though, you are a barbarian and you have no room for fear or questioning the night.  Fate will decide what happens and there is nothing you can do about it, that is your pagan belief.  That is how it has always been and that is how it always will be.  For now you will get up and go forth to warm yourself by the fire.  Once outside you feel the air that woke you.  Unnaturally cold the wind is tonight, no matter how many furs you wear the wind bites through them like a gnoll gnawing on a baby's body.  You move closer to

 the fire as you try to escape the frigid wind.  Startled, you quickly turn to your left to see the village shaman next to you.  He stares into your eyes, probing your very soul.  Again the wind sneaks up your furs like a snake through the grass.  The shaman speaks to you in his old and dying voice, "Grim my friend, can you feel the air tonight?  Cold is it not, colder then any air I have ever felt.  Fate is not on our side young shaman.  I guess I should not call you shaman yet, but I have no worries that you will pass your test.  My time is up, and yours is just beginning."  You listen intently to the shaman speak, for you have regarded him with high praise your whole life.  You can tell by the look on his face that he knows something is awry tonight.  But what it is you have yet to find out.  The elder shaman finishes coughing and tries to spew out a few more sentences to you.  "I have many things to tell you Grim, but for now we must start the ceremony.  We must start now before they come."  You mutter se

veral sentences in one as you are confused by the shamans remarks.  Before you can get your thoughts together the elder shaman scurries off to the center of the village.  You now begin to worry about the coming night.  What does it bring with it?  A question you have no answer to yet.
<p>
The largest fire is located in the center of the village.  Many trees were cut down to get the fire this high.  But it is written in the old text that the fire must be high enough to engulf the shaman.  That is punishment for not passing the test.  Not just anyone can become a shaman in your tribe.  Only those who the Tribunal has chosen will be granted the arcane arts of the shaman.
 You hear the drums begin to pound and you watch as your fellow tribesmen dance around the fire.  You hear there chants and prayers to the Tribunal as they encircle the fire.  The elder shaman stands before the fire and begins to speak.  He reads passages from the old text and draws several runes in the snow around the fire.  No fire can melt the frozen tundra of the north.  You look on in amazement as the runes begin to glow.  The arcane arts have always intrigued you.  Then you head forth to the shaman and stand before him.  Chest pushed out and every muscle in your body flexed.  A small barbarian is considered weak and useless.  The shaman recites more passages from the old text and thrusts the end of his wooden staff into one of the glowing runes.  The end of the staff glows red hot with magic.  The shaman then begins to write on you with his staff.  He draws several runes on your chest.  Every shaman has markings on him, to tell what tribe and what god he follows.  This is a sign of respect for your god 

and tribe and must be done.  Then you are ordered to place a hand on each rune.  You kneel down and place your hands on the runes.  Pain shoots through your body but you can not show that or you fail right there.  You stand up now with the markings of a shaman.  Lastly the elder shaman begins to give you his spells, his life force.  He places a hand on each side of your head and begins to chant each of his spells.  You feel his life force seeping into you.  He finishes two of his spells when you both are startled by the screams of your tribesmen.  You quickly turn around to see your tribesmen dying.  You can not tell what is killing them though.  All you see is a flash of light around a man then his chest explodes spilling his insides on the ground.  Then you see several humanoid creatures weaving the spells that are killing your friends.  They are all wearing black and red robes so you can not make out exactly what they are.  Elder shaman begins to cast a spell but his concentration is quickly broken as bloo
<p>
d begins to flow from his eye sockets.  You want to help, you need to help, but you cant.  You are frozen with fear, unable to move a single muscle.  Elder shaman begins to cast another spell as the blood pours forth from him.  Light swirls around his hands and blasts forth at you.  You are engulfed in his light and can see nothing but a bright light.  You notice that you can now move.  Then the light fades and you are in Halas, but how did you get here.  You have never heard of a spell that can move you from one place to another.  But then again you have not really heard of many spells.  In fact you only know two.  
You look all around Halas in a daze.  You are still disoriented from the spell.  Then things go black again and you leave the conscious world.  You awake in the local inn staring up at the elder shaman.  You are ecstatic as you have dreamed last nights events.  But then Elder shaman quickly dismisses that and you realize that in fact you are still dreaming.  Elder shaman has used his last strength to teleport you to the town and leave this message in your head.  "Grim, go forth with what little knowledge you have.  Find these men and avenge your tribe, do not let us die in vain.  I have only left you with two of my spells.  There are many more out there but you must know where to look for them.  Norrath is a huge world, I know it will all seem new since you have never left the confines of our snow covered huts, but you must venture forth."  His image fades as you start to awake.  The last thing you hear is " do not let us have died in vain."  With that everything you knew of your tribe is gone. except you.  Y

ou reach into your pocket and feel some coins, a medicine bag and your book of spells.  With this you must find out the truth.
