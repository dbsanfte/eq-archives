<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=167 HEIGHT=259 SRC="d_rallos_zek.gif"><font face="helvetica" size=2>The followers of Rallos Zek believe in survival of the strong

 and death to the weak. In the heat of battle is the only

 place where enlightenment can be gained. The universe

 was formed by conflict and in conflict it will end. The

 victors feasting upon the remains of their fallen enemy. No

 respect or regard is given to the dead, for if they were

 worthy their hearts would still pump blood through their

 veins and not upon the soil of Norrath. Followers of Zek are

 almost exclusively warriors.
