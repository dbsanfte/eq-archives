<p>
This manual that you can buy in the game tells you that you need another manual called "Guide to Blacksmithing" which is
kind of useless unless you want to make studs for studded leather or reinforced leather.
<p>
Here are some excerpts from the Armor and Weapons Guide:
<p>
<b>Required</b><br>
A forge<br>
Earth<br>
Fire<br>
Water<br>
Skill<br>
<p>
I have not figured out the Earth and Fire part, I assume they mean the forge.  Anyway what you do is buy sheets of metal, 
you need the appropriate amount of sheet metal to produce the item you want to make, here is a rundown of 
the peices you can make, and how many sheets of metal you will need:
<p>
<b>Belts, Cloaks, Helms, Masks, and Sleeves.</b><br>
2 Sheets of Metal
<p>
<b>Leggings, Mail, and Mantles</b><br>
3 Sheets of Metal
<p>
The size of the armor is determined by the mold used.
<p>
Each section of the Banded Armor requires a Sheet of Metal and a Mold appropriate to that section of the body. Each also requires a flask of water to cool it.
<p>
Each piece of Banded Armor can be sized to a small, medium or large client.
<p>
Now I found a Gorget mold, but notice how the list does not show a gorget in it.  So some experimentation might be needed.  Also my 
smithing skill of my character is low, so I bought a leggings mold, 3 sheets of metal, and 1 Flask of Water and went to the forge.  I placed all 
the items in there and hit the combine button.  I failed my skill check, but I got the appropriate message that says:
<p>
<i>You lack the skill necessary to fashion the item</i>
<p>
You can also get the message:
<p>
<i>These items cannot be combined.</i>
<p>
This means you tried to combine things that could not be combined and the result is you lose whatever you were trying to 
combine and have to start over, so be careful.
<p>
Here is the sizing of armor based on Race:
<p>
Some types of Armor must be sized to your client. There are three sizes of armor: Small, Medium and Large. Some races can wear more than one size of armor.
<p>
     Barbarians, Ogres and Trolls can wear large armor.<br>
     Barbarians, Elves, Erudites, Half-Elves and Humans wear medium armor.<br>
     Dwarves, Elves, Gnomes and Halflings wear small armor. <br>
Good luck!

You can create some useful things with the smithing skill, and can also produce the pieces needed to 
fasion studded leather, and reinforced leather.

<br>
3 Large Bricks of Ore = 1 Block of Ore
<p>
You will need a flask of water to cool the Ore.

<center><font face="helvetica" size="4"><b>Guide to Fletching</b></font></center>
<p>
Fletching, the art of making arrows from component peices, is one of the oldest weapon crafts on Norrath.
This tome details the construction of arrows, as well as providin information on the sister craft of the Bowyer.
Bowyers and Fletchers both require a Fletching Kit to practice their trade.
Fletching kits can be purchased from archery shops.
<p>
<b>Shaft</b><p>
The shaft of the arrow can be made from a variety of different materials. The most common material used for shafts is wood. Bone shafts are stronger than wood, and Porcelain
strongr than Bone.  Steel is the strongest material used for arrow shaft.
<p>
<b>Nock</b><p>
There are three types of Nocks, differenciated by the size of their grooves. The larger to groove, the easier the arrow is to make. The smaller the groove, the farhter the arrow
travels
<p>
<b>Arrows</b><p>
There are four parts to every arrow.
Generally, the cheaper the part, the easier it is to assemble.
Expensive componenets produce superior arrows.
<p>
<b>Tip</b><p>
There are many designs for arrow tips. The most common is the point tipped arrow. Slightly more damaging is the hooked tip - it's small blades cause tearing and bleeding. Actual
bladed arrows do more damage than the hook tipped arrows, though they are easier to remove.
<p>
<b>Fletch</b><p>
The fletch, or feathering, of the arrow influences the distance the arrow travels, as well as the impact delivered upon a succesful hit.
The easiest pattern to fletch is a round cut.
Slightly more difficult is the parabolic cut, whos spin gives the arrow additional flight range.
The shield cut fletch pattern has a shorter range than either the round of the parabolic cut, but produces a spin providing superior armor penetration.
