<center>Planar Raids</center>
<P>
<P>
Pre-random prior to fighting. Each class will random and that order will be established for the duration of that raid. The first person may choose to pass on loot if they wish until something they wants comes up knowing that at any time no item may come after for them to loot.. Then if everyone chooses to "Pass" on an item (i.e. cleric shield, cleric boots) then the first person could take it without penalty or pass again to anyone who wants it for no penalty.<BR>
<P>
<P>
Planar Robes, Breastplates, High end encounter Quest armour pieces will be the exception to the above Rule. In those instances where these items are obtained while on a guild raid, the guild leader, and in the absence of the guild leader, the raid organizer/leader will assign those particular pieces.<BR> 
<P>
<P>
<BR>
The short and simple of this goes as follows..<BR>
*Loot goes to those that can and will equip first.<BR> 
*Class loot always goes to a member of that class.<BR> 
*If no one in group can or will equip it then that item should be offered to one that can/will in the guild.<BR> 
*If none of the above makes sense random.<BR>
<P>
<P>
When we have guests along.. They will be allowed to random along with the rest of the group there. Class groupings included.
<P>
<P>
<P>
It is expected that if on a guild raid, the items earned on the raid would stay within the guild. I would not like to think that someone would random on an item against another in the family that would use it then turn around and sell it the very next day 
<P>
<P>
<P><BR>
<center>1 or 2 guild groupings where we are going on a specific raid.</center>
<P>
<P>
Those that can use, that are in attendance at the raid, get first choice on the item.. There will be a random on the item between those of the specific class(es) involved that are interested. (The exception being stated in regards to high end encounters. See above exception.) If not, it is randomed between all that wish the item. At that time a trade will be effected. i.e., if the item that is being replaced is not no drop, it is to be handed over to an officer within the guild. That item will be held for another within the guild that can use or to be awarded as a prize or recognition for outstanding performance within the family.
<P>
<P>
<P><BR>
Individual groupings and experience groups can decide amongst themselves as to how loot will be distrubted.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<BR>
Rewards for Service to the Family will be handled in a different manner. i.e., in game guild meeting and public recognition of service tendered. 
<P>
<P><P><BR>
*This policy is in effect for GUILD ONLY raids of two groups or more and the items referred to are those items that are acquired on guild raids. We do not expect you to hand over items that you acquired on your own or were gifted to you by another. I.e., You recieve a breastplate from a guild raid. You upgrade that Breastplate. You would be expected to hand over the Breastplate A you recieved at the guildraid to another in the family. It stays within the guild. When handing over the breastplate you explain that it is family property and needs to stay within the family.*
