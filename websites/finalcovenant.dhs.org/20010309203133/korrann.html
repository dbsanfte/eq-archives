<font size=+1><i>I was born a poor mountain dwarf.  Times were hard for my family.  Living so close to the surface meant that we were always on alert for that next goblin raid.  Sometimes 3 to 4 times a day we could expect at least a handful or the smelly green creatures.  Our community seemed to develop many courageous warriors and many needed healers.  Our community was aptly named Prima Difesa.  We were well decorated and much honored for our services.  But medals and praise did not feed us well.  We went out and foraged in parties to find what we could but it was a very dangerous operation.  We always suffered tremendous losses but it was the only way we knew.  Many of our greatest warriors and healers left when they heard that their skills could be used to find great riches and greater glory.  Most that left said they would return and bring back everything they received to finally bring the community its much-deserved glory.  Few if any returned.  This is what happened to me.
<P>
I grew up without a father.  My father died before I was born in the great Goblin-Orc raid of '16.  I was told he was a great fighter and protector.  He served the community well and was one of the few Inner-dwarves that migrated up to perform his duty.  My mother always felt pained that her healing skills were not good enough to save him.  She then devoted her life to learning everything she could of the healing arts.  Even traveling great distances underground to seek out the most knowledgeable teachers and returning and sharing her knowledge with the others.  I helped her conduct the research she needed and was learning the trade myself.  
<P>
About my 32nd birthday my mother and I began the long trek from Kaladim to the famed city of  Steamfont to learn from the great gnome teachers.  We were set on by a great horde of goblins.  We held them off as well as we could but my mother went down and I was forced to run.  I waited and later returned but there was not much left of my mother.  Those foul beasts mutilated her body and no praying I could perform could bring her back to me.  There I decided that I must travel the world.  Not stopping until I could bring back the knowledge that would save us from the ravages of all these monsters.
<P>
I know that sounds familiar and my chance of returning would be slim but I did make it back.  When I received my 22nd circle I gave up my worldly possessions and returned to the village.  I stayed for many years.  Becoming a teacher to the local healers and bringing a better life to them.  But after a time the wanderlust of Norrath did take a hold of me again.  I vowed I would return with more knowledge as soon as I could and I set forth for more knowledge and adventure.  
<P>
That brings me to where I am now.  Back out in Norrath.  Making sure that the forces of evil do not win their fight and that I can soon return to the village I still love and bring forth a more stable and fulfilling life for them all.
