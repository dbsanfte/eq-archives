<h1><i>"Welcome to our Tavern.... "</i></h1>
<blockquote><blockquote>
The little bard smiles and sets down her quill.  Turning to you, she begins to speak softly.. 
<P>
Please, be seated and enjoy the fire and the ale.  Our  Tavern is for all to enjoy and use..  It is a place for recounting of tales and battles.  It is also a place for those that are friends to the family known as The Final Covenant."
<P>  
"If you are one that seeks to join this fine family, listed here are those things which you must accomplish.  It is not difficult nor tedious.  But it does give us insight into your personality and habits.  Be warned... if you are accepted into this family, we are just that, a family.  We love and we squabble, but through it all, we remain family and are stronger for it.  If you truly desire a place within our family, you will find that which we ask is not so very difficult. "  
<P>
The little bard sorts through the stack of parchments to her side and withdraws one, handing it to you... "Please read this as it will answer your questions."
<P>
<P>
Application Process
<P>
1) The Final Covenant is an invite only guild. Each applicant must have a sponsor who is a full member of this family . Sponsors are expected to know the applicant well enough to vouch for their virtue.
<P>
2) The sponsor will make a request in the guild only application forum. The request should state pertinent information about the applicant and contain their email address.
<P>
3) The sponsor will encourage the person to get to know as many family members as possible and to get to know the officers. They can find who they are on the eq.guildmagic.com/
<P>
4) A minimum of five regular members and one officer must reply to the request and state that they think the applicant would make a good addition. Each person posting must have grouped with the individual and be fairly certain that they would make good members.
<P>
5) Upon meeting the above requirements, a questionnaire will be sent out to the applicant and the guild leadership will decide if and when the applicant will be invited as a page.
<P>

Description of a Page
<P>
Pages are basically those waiting to be accepted as full members within the guild. They shall enjoy the privileges of the guild with the exception of the guild banner and access to the guild only message board. They shall have the banner, but must remain Anon until full membership is achieved. Any violation of this shall be grounds of immediate dismissal from the guild.
<P>
The following outlines the page process:
<P>
1) The canidate will remain a page for a maximum of 30 days, in which a decision will be made if they are to be accepted into the guild. Acceptance will be granted at the monthly guild meeting.
<P>
2) Before the meeting, the guild will be asked for their opinions of each of the pages using the guild only message board. The thread will be deleted before the meeting. 
<P>
3) The officers will convene and make a final decision on each of the pages. A minimum of 2 officers must be convinced that the page would make a good candidate. If any officer votes against the page, he/she will not be accepted. 
<P>
Pages are STRONGLY encouraged to attend guild events, write on the message boards, speak in guild chat, and group within the guild. We are looking for active members, thus their activity and the thoughts of the guild will be reviewed when making the final decision

<P>
<p>
The little bard begins to speak again..  "I wish you good luck on your quest to become a part of this family. "
<P>
"Merry Met, Merry Part, Merry Meet Again"
<P>
Picking up her quill, the little bard returns to her writing.
