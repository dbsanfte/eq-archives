We beg thy indulgence and please excuse the mess as we continue to grow and add more each day.  </font></i></center>

<font size=+2><I>January 5th, 2001--Plane of Hate</f>
<BR>
<Font size=+1>The Final Covenant again has proven their worth.  Assisted by friends from other families, such as Ashen Vendetta, The Pantheon, Justifiers, Patronas Veritas, Daughters of Innoruuk, Lost Souls of Glaznor, we moved into the Plane of Hate.  Running to camp proved to be a thing of luck this night.  Several were not able to make it past a little rat skulking in a corner on the wall.   After a wait, and the ressurections completed, we began to let our might be felt.
<P>
This was an absolute first for many, having never before been to this place of hatred.  Cragie and Nadilya learned the names of many of the denizens, learning how to be primary and secondary assists.  Lifted and Ishogio, learning how to pull within the place, led by Balandrus.  
<P>
Soon, we encountered the Maestro.  Only ONE fatality during that battle, happening within the first 5 seconds.  Krattack called out words the Maestro took great exception to and was dead before his body hit the ground.
<P>
All in all it was a very successful raid.  Many people walked away with something this night as a momento
<P>
Allayna-Essence of Vampire.  This was all she required to complete her  Enchanters Epic Quest.

Plane of Fear....
<BR>
After some delay, The Final Covenant entered the plane of Fear.  Running to the North Camp was indeed a successful venture.  Few fell along the way.  Special thanks must be extended to those that were on the pull team.  Without their expert guidance, the raid upon the plane that rains blood would not have been near the success that it was.

A set of Shiverback Wristbands did drop and were destroyed as there were no monks to join us in our venture.  Unfortunately, or fortunately, Cazic Thule deigned not to make an appearance last night. 

Thank you all, to the Final Covenat, Daughters of Innoruuk, Justifiers and Unbroken. Specifically, thank you to Dakker and Rykar.  Your selfless sacrifices time and again for our raid is greatly appreciated. Thank you for making our second raid to the plane a very successful raid!

*ooc commentary*<BR>
As one can see, I have been working on the looks of the web page.  Please bear with me as I work through some of the coding.  I am learning as I go. I am starting to unify the look and pull the web site together..There will be added a history page that will include past members names and the biographies recieved from them.  As well, I am working on the classes page.  This will help everyone identify what classes we are strong in and what classes we are lacking.  Again.. Thank you for your patience as I struggle through this labour of love... (kinda like having a baby.. grins)
