<font size=+1><i>Hugh Wolfrydr--In a realm far away from Norrath, two adventurers formed a partnership. Wolfrydr, who is known as Hugh Wolfrider
in that realm, had grown to some prominence. Ahhh, but let's get to the beginning.
<P>
Hugh, is the son of Lord Owen and Lady Shay. When he was very young, he became separated from his family.
Helpless in the great forest and at the mercy of all evil that dwells there. A very large grizzly bear came upon the
young lad. This bear was quite unusual, for his fur was completely silver!. Grizzly Bear, has he was called by Hugh,
picked up the young orphan and carried him to a very secret place. There he let the young boy rest. Shortly, a grey
wolf approached the two. This was a very strange meeting, for the two animals were actually talking! More amazing
,Hugh could understand them! It was agreed between the two that the Grey Wolf Clan would raise Hugh.
<P>
Now Hugh, was very young and didn't have the strength to run with the pack on their hunts. Like all pups he remained
behind and was look after by one of the older females in the pack. Hugh, learned to track with his nose, smell the wind
to learn if danger was about. And like all pups played with other pups in the pack. As Hugh grew stronger and he still
wish to run with the pack. Yet his legs still were not strong enough to keep up. Then, one day while Grizzly Bear was at
the camp, he picked up Hugh and placed him on Grey Wolf's back. Hugh dug his fingers into the thick mane of the
wolf's neck, and squeezed his legs as tight as he could around the great wolf's shoulder. Grey Wolf leaped off with a
great bound. Hugh buried his face deep into the grey fur of the wolf. Grey Wolf was very careful about how he ran and
Hugh managed not to fall. It wasn't long before Hugh was running with the pack. Villagers were startled to see a
young boy on the back of a huge wolf. Soon, word spread around the realms of people seeing a boy riding on the back
of a wolf. Soon he was being called the Wolfrider. 
<P>
Hugh, grew in strength and wisdom with the pack. From Grizzly Bear, he gained strength. From the great cats he
learned stealth. And from the wolves he learned the value of a pack.
<P>
As Hugh got older, the Clan had decided he needed to return to humans to learn how to speak the ways of their group.
It was at this time that Hugh Wolfrider found his mother and father. Lady Shay was overwhelmed with joy. But, she
knew she had a lot of work to do to "civilized" this wild creature who was dropped off at her doorstep. But, all
mothers have a natural instinct to nurture their young and Lady Shay was no different. Hugh, finally learned to be
human, but he was still rather wild.</font></i><P>
