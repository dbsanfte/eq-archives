<P>
<Font Size=+1><B><I>Wolfy, was becoming a hunter and warrior of some renown. One day, while traveling in a dungeon named Shame, he
came upon a poor hapless gully dwarf. For some reason, Wolfy, took pity on this poor creature. Thinking the gully
dwarf would make a nice "pet" he took it home. Lady Shay would have no part of this. having a semi wild boy in the
house was one thing, but to have a gully dwarf, was totally out of the question. And with a great heave, she tossed
them both out the front door.
<P>
Hugh, still unused to human ways, didn't really understand what the problem was. He thought the gully dwarf was just
a little dirty, so he would give him a bath. This was the first and ONLY time Wolfy tried to give a gully dwarf a bath!
For some unknown reason gully dwarves like being dirty. And Highbulp was no different. To this day, Highbulp had
had only two known baths. Normally gully dwarfs can count only to two. Only Pudg, king of the gully dwarves, could
count higher. And Pudg referred to everything above two as "a whole bunch"! Yet, Highbulp could count! He also
understood logic. This sparked the interest of Wolfrydr. Thus they started doing things together. Soon and bond
developed between. 
<P>
Wolf's skills leaned toward the woods and nature. Wolf believes in "The Balance". That all things have a purpose.
Both good and evil must exist. Sometimes the Balance will be off center, but, in time, it will come back. Wolfrydr seem
to know he was going to be a druid for a very long time.
<P>
Highbulp had the unusual ability to make things better. More then once he has put Wolfrydr back together after one of
their misadventures. Highbulp also likes to crawl into computer and "fix" things. Much to the dismay of Wolfrydr.
Highbulp has learned the way of a cleric. Much to the amazement of other humans around him. Lady Shay, now
tolerates the gully dwarf, but she still will not let him in her house. But she does let him in the tavern, for it seems the
dwarf is a damn good cook! Of course, Lady Shay has learned a long time ago not to ask exactly WHERE Highbulp
got the ingredients he puts in the pot!</font></B></I>
