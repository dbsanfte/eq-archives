<Font size=+1><i><b>The History Ohaga Bonecaster...</font></i><p></b>
<P>
<font size=+1><i>Many Years have passed since the Birth of this gentle giant.  Many years ago in Oggok, Ohaga was
Brought to life by his parents and with the aid of (god) his god. While still young Ohaga was 
raised in the shamans chambers, educated and trained he was growing to become a Shaman like his 
father before him.  Although very young, much promise was seen in this young ogre to become 
something great, even the oracles believed that he would surpass his father in might and wisdom.</font></i><p>
<p>
<Font size=+1><i>But alas, one foul day while Ohaga was sent on a quest by his shaman council, his family and what
he knew to be home was taken from him.  Ohaga's returned from his quest to find his parents Hut
Torched, with His father and mother inside both slain.  This news quickly reached the council and
Ohaga was hidden for many days with hope that whoever had slain his parents would give up in their
search for him as well.  Days past and news was brought to the council that a band of dark elves 
were responsible, "but how could this be so?" Ohaga thought to himself...  "Were any of my fathers
actions in his life so bad that an order from Neriak itself was placed to end his life? or is it 
more than that?".</font></i><p>
<p>
<font size=+1><i>Sifting through what was once his home, looking for anything to salvage Ohaga found a buried chest 
underneath the hearth of the hut.  Inside he gazed upon a dazzling full set of Banded armour, once
his father, and now his.  Dawning on his Fathers suit, and with his Runed Totem Staff, Ohaga Bids
his council farewell one last time.  Ohaga has set out onto this world to find those who has done
him wrong and to repay their deeds with a swift death.  With only the single clue to spurn Ohaga 
to action, He left his home for that last time, not to return till his ultimate quest was complete.</font></i><P>
<P>
<font size=+1><i>Many seasons have passed, and Ohaga living a solitary life, had few friends and no family.  Seeking
those who needed aid he devoted his time in aiding other when needed.  From healing those younger 
than him to speeding those up in a hurry to get somewhere, Ohaga still could not quite fill a void
that was slowly eating him away, a family...  friends.  One day Ohaga was meditating after a grueling
battle when he heard the shouts of a lost lady, looking for guidence to Cazic Thule.  After guiding
this "pretty lady"as Ohaga reffered to her and Xaria to others, a lasting bond was made without
his knowing.  A few season passed, a few conversations with Xaria, and then a finally meeting Her
Married half, her husband, Hindance.  Hindace and Xaria both asked Ohaga at this meeting if he was
interested in being within their close circle of friends.  Xaria speaks quietly "For you are kind and
gentle Ohaga, are a true friend and unlike most Ogres we have encountered did not attack us, but
helped me when I needed it most.  For it was this selfless act of kindness that we ask you to be 
our friend."</font></i><p>
<p>
<font size=+1><i>"At last a family" Ohaga thought, It was from this day that Ohaga was brought into the family of 
The Final Covenant.  And this day Ohaga has found the rebirth of his parents in the form of Xaria
and Hindance, to Ohaga they are his adoptive parents.</font></i><p>
