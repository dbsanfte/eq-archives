<Font size=+1><I><b>Twenty-one summers ago, a Dwarven infant was born in Kaladim.....This happens all the time in these lands of Norrath, but this infant had been chosen already to be a priest of Brell Serilis.....The Dwarven Midwives gave the boy, against the mother's wishes, to the Priests of Brell, for they saw a mark on his body, a birthmark that looked like feathered wings covering his back.....
<P>
Upon showing this mark to the Priests, they took him in with open arms.....They nurtured him and gave him a name of one of Brell's students when he was but a mere mortal.....That name was Ozheel..... 
<P>
When time came to teach the young Dwarf, he learned of the ways of Priesthood under Brell.....He learned very rapidly and became a student of many things in his youth.....He also began to stitch together the clothing of the Priests, seemingly a natural at being a Tailor..... 
<P>
He also learned the use of a weapon, but has chosen not to use it unless necessary.....Since he likes to keep both of his rugged hands busy, he chose to learn the use of most large and blunt weapons.....They also trained him in the use of many types of armor, how to move in the different types, the uses of each type, and how to survive in different climates when wearing the armor..... Eventually, they set the boy of thirteen out on his own, for he matured at a very early age.....He began to fend for himself in the areas of the Butcherblock Mountains.....And throughout his training, he was never grouped with other students, being a soloist in his teachings.....In doing so, he also, on his own at this early age, hasn't found a need of making friends and keeping constant groups with anyone..... 
<P>
Being trained to his Sixth Circle of Priesthood in Brell's Service, he learned of his brother, Arongarr.....Since he had been taken from birth to the Priesthood, he had not known of his brother.....He had embraced his brother with open arms, rejoicing in this newfound knowledge.....Ever since then, they have grown so together that when one is in danger, the other knows.....Tis probably why Arongarr is now with us, more than likely sensing the danger posed by R.....
<P>
Upon reaching his Ninth Circle of Priesthood at the age of nineteen, he decided to travel the lands.....He took a boat to the main island of Norrath, and found a harsh desert called Northern Ro.....Here, he decided, he would find his calling.....Here, he decided, he would make a friend..... 
<P>
During his Tenth Circle, he came across a young man by the name of Tartufe.....Ozheel cured, healed, and buffed this man as if he would any other traveller who needed his gift that was bestowed upon him by Brell.....But this time it was different.....Tartufe actually talked to Ozheel as if he was a friend.....This came as quite a shock to the young Dwarf..... 
<P>
A friend..... 
<P>
Tartufe asked him if he would be interested in making more friends.....by joining the guild he was in.....Dumbfounded by his new friend's request, he decided to see what friendship really was, and he accepted..... 
<P>
Ozheel is now a Vassal among The Final Covenant.....He has made many friends, more than the one that he was expecting in his journeys of Northern Ro.....He thanks Brell for guiding him to the man named Tartufe, and The Final Covenant..... 
<P>
Only a few nights ago, He was the Master of the Ceremony for Shadowulf and Shayye's marriage.....It went very well, having the gods bless the marriage in the lands of the Butcherblock Mountains.....Brell shined upon all that day.....
<P>
Ozheel has convinced his brother, Arongarr, to join the Final Covenant, so they, too, can call him brother.....He is a very honorable Dwarven Priest of Brell Serilis as well.....
<P>
Ozheel now resides in Norrath, no one area his home.....He travels from land to land, righting what wrongs he can, healing those in need.....He is a friend to all, until they prove otherwise.....He is Family to only a few.....He has found that he likes to be with the Final Covenant.....
