The Final Covenant (known hereafter as FC) is a guild dedicated to the following precepts. Goodness, Role-playing, and most of all... Friendship. We do not believe in practicing Kill Stealing, Greed, Deceit, or Evil. It is open to all that share this philosophy. All races and classes are welcome as long as their powers are used to uphold the founding precepts. We are a guild that is dedicated not only to helping our fellow guildmates, but those around us. We shall exemplify friendship and goodness to all we encounter. None shall be shunned in their request for aid. If it is within our ability to offer assistance, it shall be given.<br>
<br>
This guild shall be run in the fashion of those of old. It is not a democracy...it is a guild. The guild leader shall have FINAL say in all matters that relate to the guild and it's members. As in the guilds of old, there shall be an established hierarchy. Those in the top tier, including the guild leader, shall be known as Lords/Ladies. Below them are vassals, and below them shall be the pages. There is one other position within the guild. That known as Guild Champion. These titles, are just that...titles. They shall not be construed as license to belittle or degrade those below ones stature (as this would go against the FC founding precepts). Should the guild leader hear of any such nonsense, it shall be his/her duty to strip the offending member of all his/her titles and privileges.<br>
<br>
No man/woman stands alone...so, the guild leader shall have a council of advisors. The council shall be made up of 8 members. These advisors shall be known as Lords/Ladies within the guild. It is their duty to gather and discuss all matters that deal with the guild and it's members. They shall then report any findings/conclusions to the guild leader along with any recommendations they may have. It shall also be the councils duty to screen all applicants to the guild.<br>
<br>
Vassals shall have the responsibility of spreading the word and goodwill of the FC (though all should practice this). They are the backbone of the guild, and as such, must uphold the honor of the guild. This is not to say that they must answer every duel that is presented to them (this is the duty of the guild Champion). It means that their actions shall embody all that the guild holds dear. There shall be no limit to the number of vassals within the guild at any one time. <br>
<br>
Pages are basically those waiting to be accepted as full members within the guild. They shall enjoy the privileges of the guild with the exception of the guild banner. They shall have the banner, but must remain Anon until full membership is achieved. Any violation of this shall be grounds of immediate dismissal from the guild. To become a page, one must be vouched for by any member of The Final Covenant, the council or the guild leader. To become a full member, the page must follow the recruitment policies set forth. NOTE: Any actions by the serf shall be the responsibility of the vouching guild member, council member or guild leader ...so choose with care.<br>
<br>
The Champion can be of any rank within the guild (other than guild leader). They shall be known as the Chosen. The Chosen shall be selected by the guild leader. While this is a title of great honor, it is also one that comes at great expense. It is the duty of the champion to accept ALL challenges that question the guilds honor and goodness. They cannot turn down any such challenge, no matter the strength of the challenger, without direct permission from the guild leader. The Chosen fights for the honor of the guild, and as such may request any item that another member owns to help in his/her duties. This shall only be done in times of pending duels, and the item shall be returned after such duels. ONLY the Chosen, the Guild Champion may duel with the guild banner showing. All others, when dueling must go anonymous. <br>
<br>
It is the duty of all members to help their guild brothers and sisters. First, we are to encourage each other in the development of trade skills and master a trade. In this way, we can help each other acquire items needed for quests and armour, etc. There will be a guild treasury established to this end. Items, armour, weapons, coin will be set back to aid those within the guild that are in need. These things will be strictly on a loan until a suitable replacement can be found.<br>
<br>
Secondly, when help is requested, the proper response should be that help is on it's way…not…well…so and so is near thee..ask them. It should also be noted that the nature of the game involves people camping rare spawns…for many many hours. This should be taken into account as it does occur. But, if ye can help, no matter the distance, ye should. NOTE: This does not mean that a 1st level member should drop his hunting spree in the newbie area to assist a brother/sister in the Plane of Fear. Please use good judgment.<br>
<br>
In this guild, it is your character that is the member, not the controlling person. Ye may have more than one character within the guild. Any other characters that ye may have, may belong to other guilds, as long as it does not interfere with FC duties.<br>
<br>
As happens in all situations, a guildmate may find that they are no longer content to be within the guild. They may take their leave at any time from the guild. Doing so will garner no ill-will nor repercussions. They will still be considered a friend of the guild and will still enjoy the friendship of all former guildmates. <br>
<br>
Dismissal from the guild will be done at the Guild Leaders discretion. When this happens, titles and banners shall be removed from the disgraced member and all shall turn their backs upon the former member. No aid or assistance shall be forthcoming from this guild towards the removed member. Any caught doing so, shall answer to the Guild Leader for their actions. Once dismissed from the guild, that character shall never be allowed to petition for re-admission into the guild. As with anything, when growth occurs, changes too must occur. This charter is subject to change as circumstances warrant. However the founding principles will and shall always remain the same.
