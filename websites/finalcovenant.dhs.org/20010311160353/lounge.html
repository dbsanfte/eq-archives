<br>But his fists were fast as lightening.

<BR>Lounge hated arithmetic,
<br>But could release an awesome kick.
<br>Oo, student of Talon.
<br>Oo, student of Talon.
<P>
<br>A scholar he will never be,

<br>And with his Master's teaching at hand,
<br>He journeyed to Anatonica's land.

<br>Chapter 1:  Waspp and Lotuss
<br>Part 1:
<P>
<br>Lounge meet a Wood Elf couple,
<br>And from the beginning knew they were trouble.
<br>Oo, huggers of the trees.
<br>Oo, huggers of the trees
<P>
<br>They liked to levitate off the ground,
<br>And teleport all around.
<br>Oo, huggers of the trees.
<P>
<br>Their names were Waspp and Lotuss.
<br>Our hero tried to teach them to focus,
<br>Alas they could neither wax off or on.
<P>
<br>Tired of waiting for a spawn,
<br>"Over those dunes lie the Orc Pawns!"
<br>Lotuss pointed saying, "Let's see what they con."
<P>
<br>Oo, huggers of the trees.
<br>Oo, huggers of the trees.

Part 2:
<P>
<br>Now thumping Orcs is all in good fun,
<br>But soon the Druids said, "We have to run,"
<br>"Before the Moon replaces the Sun."
<P>
<br>With a bow of Lounge's head,
<br>Over the sandy dunes they fled,
<br>Never stopping even once to med.
<P>
<br>Oo, huggers of the trees.
<br>Oo, huggers of the trees.

<br>Chapter 2:  Achates
<P>
<br>Part 1:
<P>
<br>Lounge came upon a strange creature,
<br>With a very harsh feature.
<P>
<br>Oo, Wolf of the North Star.
<br>Oo, Wolf of the North Star.
<P>
<br>Now Lounge believed an ordinary Man he be,
<br>Until the figure growled, "Are ye staring at me?!"
<P>
<Br>Oo, Wolf of the North Star.
<br>Oo, Wolf of the North Star.
<P>
<Br>With a grimacing frown,
<br>The burly man knocked Lounge to the ground.
<br>Stating his name was Achates!
<P>
<br>"I am no mere Man!"
<br>"But a Barbarian!!"
<br>"Could you not tell by my traits!?"
<P>
<br>Oo, Wolf of the North Star.
<br>Oo, Wolf of the North Star.</font>
