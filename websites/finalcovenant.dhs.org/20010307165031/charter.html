<p>
                   The Final Covenant (known hereafter as FC) is a guild dedicated to the following
                   precepts. Goodness, Role-playing, and most of all….Friendship. We do not
                   believe in practicing Kill Stealing, Greed, Deceit, or Evil. It is open to all that
                   share this philosophy. All races and classes are welcome as long as their powers
                   are used to uphold the founding precepts. We are a guild that is dedicated not
                   only to helping our fellow guildmates, but those around us. We shall exemplify
                   friendship and goodness to all we encounter. None shall be shunned in their
                   request for aid. If it is within our ability to offer assistance, it shall be given. 
<p>
                   This guild shall be run in the fashion of those of old. It is not a democracy….it is
                   a guild. The guild leader shall have FINAL say in all matters that relate to the
                   guild and it's members. As in the guilds of old, there shall be an established
                   hierarchy. Those in the top tier, including the guild leader, shall be known as
                   Lords/Ladies. Below them are vassals, and below them shall be the serfs. There
                   is one other position within the guild. That known as Guild Champion. These
                   titles, are just that….titles. They shall not be construed as license to belittle or
                   degrade those below ones stature (as this would go against the FC founding
                   precepts). Should the guild leader hear of any such nonsense, it shall be his/her
                   duty to strip the offending member of all his/her titles and privileges.
<p>
                   No man/woman stands alone…so, the guild leader shall have a council of
                   advisors. The council shall be made up of 8 members. These advisors shall be
                   known as Lords/Ladies within the guild. It is their duty to gather and discuss all
                   matters that deal with the guild and it's members. They shall then report any
                   findings/conclusions to the guild leader along with any recommendations they
                   may have. It shall also be the councils duty to screen all applicants to the guild.
<p>
                   Vassals shall have the responsibility of spreading the word and goodwill of the
                   FC (though all should practice this). They are the backbone of the guild, and as
                   such, must uphold the honor of the guild. This is not to say that they must
                   answer every duel that is presented to them (this is the duty of the guild
                   Champion). It means that their actions shall embody all that the guild holds
                   dear. There shall be no limit to the number of vassals within the guild at any one
                   time. 
<p>
                   Serfs are basically those waiting to be accepted as full members within the
                   guild. They shall enjoy the privileges of the guild with the exception of the guild
                   banner. They shall have the banner, but must remain Anon until full membership
                   is achieved. Any violation of this shall be grounds of immediate dismissal from
                   the guild. To become a serf, one must be vouched for by any member of the
                   council or the guild leader. To become a full member, the serf must be vouched
                   for by no less than four members of the council and/or the guild leader. NOTE:
                   Any actions by the serf shall be the responsibility of the vouching council
                   member…so choose with care. There can only be 9 serfs at any one time within
                   the guild. 
<p>
                   The Champion can be of any rank within the guild (other than guild leader). They
                   shall be known as the Chosen. The Chosen shall be selected by the guild leader.
                   While this is a title of great honor, it is also one that comes at great expense. It
                   is the duty of the champion to accept ALL challenges that question the guilds
                   honor and goodness. They cannot turn down any such challenge, no matter the
                   strength of the challenger, without direct permission from the guild leader. The
                   Chosen fights for the honor of the guild, and as such may request any item that
                   another member owns to help in his/her duties. This shall only be done in times
                   of pending duels, and the item shall be returned after such duels. ONLY the
                   Chosen, the Guild Champion may duel with the guild banner showing. All others,
                   when dueling must go anonymous. 
<p>
                   It is the duty of all members to help their guild brothers and sisters. First, we
                   are to encourage each other in the development of trade skills and master a
                   trade. In this way, we can help each other acquire items needed for quests and
                   armour, etc. There will be a guild treasury established to this end. Items,
                   armour, weapons, coin will be set back to aid those within the guild that are in
                   need. These things will be strictly on a loan until a suitable replacement can be
                   found. 
<p>
                   Secondly, when help is requested, the proper response should be that help is on
                   it's way…not…well…so and so is near thee..ask them. It should also be noted
                   that the nature of the game involves people camping rare spawns…for many
                   many hours. This should be taken into account as it does occur. But, if ye can
                   help, no matter the distance, ye should. NOTE: This does not mean that a 1st
                   level member should drop his hunting spree in the newbie area to assist a
                   brother/sister in the Plane of Fear. Please use good judgment. 
<p>
                   In this guild, it is your character that is the member, not the controlling person.
                   Ye may have more than one character within the guild. Any other characters
                   that ye may have, may belong to other guilds, as long as it does not interfere
                   with FC duties. 
<p>
                   As happens in all situations, a guildmate may find that they are no longer
                   content to be within the guild. They may take their leave at any time from the
                   guild. Doing so will garner no ill-will nor repercussions. They will still be
                   considered a friend of the guild and will still enjoy the friendship of all former
                   guildmates. 
<p>
                   Dismissal from the guild will be done at the Guild Leaders discretion. When this
                   happens, titles and banners shall be removed from the disgraced member and all
                   shall turn their backs upon the former member. No aid or assistance shall be
                   forthcoming from this guild towards the removed member. Any caught doing so,
                   shall answer to the Guild Leader for their actions. Once dismissed from the guild,
                   that character shall never be allowed to petition for re-admission into the guild. 
                   As with anything, when growth occurs, changes too must occur. This charter is
                   subject to change as circumstances warrant. However the founding principles
                   will and shall always remain the same.
