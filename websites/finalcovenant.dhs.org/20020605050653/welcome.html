<h1><i>"Welcome to our Tavern.... "</i></h1>
<blockquote><blockquote>
The little bard smiles and sets down her quill.  Turning to you, she begins to speak softly.. 
<P>
Please, be seated and enjoy the fire and the ale.  Our  Tavern is for all to enjoy and use..  It is a place for recounting of tales and battles.  It is also a place for those that are friends to the family known as The Final Covenant."
<P>  
"If you are one that seeks to join this fine family, listed here are those things which you must accomplish.  It is not difficult nor tedious.  But it does give us insight into your personality and habits.  Be warned... if you are accepted into this family, we are just that, a family.  We love and we squabble, but through it all, we remain family and are stronger for it.  If you truly desire a place within our family, you will find that which we ask is not so very difficult. "  
<P>
The little bard sorts through the stack of parchments to her side and withdraws one, handing it to you... "Please read this as it will answer your questions."
<P>
<P>
A) Are we actively recruiting? No and yes. We are not actively recruiting in the sense that we are looking for people of certain classes or levels to join the guild or go out recruiting. We recruit from friends and from people who go that extra mile to get to know us. 
<P>
B) Who do we invite to join: Simply put, we invite friends. The Final Covenant is not about randomly inviting people so we can fill out ranks, it is about a group of people that enjoy the company of their friends and guildmates. 
<P>
C) How do you get considered as someone to invite into joining the guild: We insist that a potential recruit spend a lot of time getting to know as many of the guild as possible. This is done by making yourself available on planes runs, larger multi-group raids that need extras (ie.- Kael, Temple of Veeshan, Epic fights, etc.), 6 person groupings and just generally keeping in touch through talking to people in guild in game and out of game on the boards.  We also have an IRC Tavern that you are welcome to come to. 
<P>
"So ok, how do I get invited on these things?" To be honest, unless you know someone in the guild very well that's willing to speak up for you then it will be difficult to do. Obviously as we fill in spots for groups we go with guildmates first, other people after that. Keep an eye on the General Raids, Pickup Groups, and Planar Raids boards to see what large group activities are going on. A good place to look for the occasional pickup group is talking to those within the guild you know and see if they or anyone else has room for another. 
<P>
The effort has to come from you.
<P>
On a side note to going on raids, Quite often, people ask us about attending events and we have to turn them down. This is largely due to the fact that we have a high attendance rate for events. It is not unusual to see 30-40 turn out for an event. With this kind of turn out we really have to limit the attendance of guests. Likewise, these event encounters are typically against mob's that are higher level. Due to the high level of these encounter mobs we usually wont add guests that are more then 10 levels below the mob. For example, against a level 65 dragon, a level 52 anything would be providing limited help while increasing lag issues as well as additional logistic issues. Don’t feel to discouraged if you find you are denied access to events and please focus primarily on meeting people via smaller events or 6 person groups.
<P>
Please remember though that this doesn’t mean /tell spamming someone. If they don’t answer, they are probably busy.. try them again another night or give them some time as people can be fighting/afk. Someone spamming multiple people over and over do not tend to build the best reputation with us. 
<P>
D) Levels: Although The Final Covenant has a minimum level requirement of level 30, the fact is that almost 100% of the guild is 50+. If you're a lower level then that, it makes it difficult in the extreme to meet people and difficult for us to get to know you. Does that mean it's impossible to join if I am a lower level? Not at all, just takes a LOT more effort.  
<P>
E) How do we actually decide whom to invite?: After you spend some time with us, your name will start being discussed on Guild only boards. Honestly, it takes most of the guilds approval for an invite. If you've really angered someone 20 levels ago, believe me.. they will speak up and let us know. Former problems that come to light will be discussed with you with an officer and then the officer will talk to the person that spoke against you. Beyond that, Invites are usually done when enough guildmates harass the GL with tells of "why haven’t we invited so and so yet?" 
<P>
Summary:<br> 
The Final Covenant is about the people behind the keyboard. We are a family oriented guild, not one which is more raid oriented. Does this mean we don’t raid? No, actually we do quite a few raids, but people are not required to goto raids if they don’t want to. We are not concerned with what class or race you play. We are concerned with how you play that character. We are very sensitive about the good reputation we have earned and wish to keep it.  
<P>
If you’re someone that killsteals, harasses people in open channels, forces PNP on people to get a spawn, etc.? Then you're probably not what we are looking for.  We are are 50 + guild, even though we would consider taking someone at a level below 50 you need to consider there reasons for joining closely before asking.  We are a family oriented guild.  One that is not focused upon raiding or loot.  If you are seeking a guild that focuses on these things, then we are not the guild you are seeking.   
<P>
Joining The Final Covenant without some type of a sponsor can be very difficult. It's not impossible, just something you have to work very hard towards. Don’t expect it to happen in a week or two. Make an effort to go out of your way to get to know people. Don’t be a pain by requiring people to come get you. Look for ways to get to where the other people are. By constantly asking for ports over and making members go out of their way so you can meet them we get the impression you don’t actually want to meet us unless its easy for you. 
<P>
Again.. the effort has to come from you. 
<P>
What is our obligation?<br>
<br>1. There must be a minimum of 10 people to speak up for you within the guild.
<br>2. There must be a minimum of 5 officers that will speak up for you.
<br>3. Your sponsor is responsible for your actions.  We take the reputation of The Final Covenant very seriously.  Your actions reflect back upon your sponsor which in turn reflects back upon the guild. 
<br>4. Once you have met the above requirements an application will be sent to you.  The officers willl review your application and make a final decision at that time. 
<br><br><br>
<P>
<p>
The little bard begins to speak again..  "I wish you good luck on your quest to become a part of this family. "
<P>
"Merry Met, Merry Part, Merry Meet Again"
<P>
Picking up her quill, the little bard returns to her writing.
