Xaria was born in the beautiful city in the treetops called Kelethin.  Her parents were simple inn-keeps. Running a fine establishment, it drew travelers from all over Norrath.  She would sit and listen by the hour to the tales recounted of acts of heroism and barbarism alike.  She led a relatively sheltered life with her parents in the inn until she reached the age of 15. It was then her parents were captured by slavers and taken into the mines of the Crushbone.  They died under the slave-masters harsh demands.  As the only child of doting parents, she was crushed by their demise.  With their death, came the news that her father was not as adept a businessman as he had led his family believe and the inne and all that was in it were confiscated to pay merchants who were owed large sums of money.  Without her parents to cosset and pet her, Xaria quickly learned how tough life without family or hearth could be.    
<p>
Setting down, Xaria took stock of her situation.  Hungry and destitute, she had to make fundamental decisions.  Only 15, she knew she would have to find a way to survive.  The thought of selling her body for the pleasure of others was as revolting as the thought of thieving. Having a pleasant voice, the ability to recall events and good at telling stories she opted to try earning her living singing and recounting tales she had heard from travelers of far-away places.  
<P>
She caught the attention of the Master-Harper, who quickly took her in and started teaching her the rudiments of becoming a bard.  The first being always keep ones eyes and ears open.  The second, keep your mouth closed.   (T'would seem a contradiction when thinking of a bard!)  If one followed those first two rules, the rest would come easily.  For several years, Xaria studied under the master-harper. He became as her father and she was content to stay close, until he died at the hands of an orc runner.  She vowed that she would do what she could to avenge the loss of those that she had loved and had died at the hands of evil beings.
<P>
Xaria had always wanted to see the faraway places and the wanderlust hit her hard with the death of her master. Her desire to learn and explore, she started her journey.  The wanderlust itching her toes she moved across the land, learning as she went.  Gleaning knowledge and little tidbits of information, she stored them back, using them to entertain and inform. What little Xaria does have at her disposal, she is always willing to share and to lend a helping hand, whenever she can.  For there are always those that are less fortunate than she, starting on their new paths or finding themselves in dire situations.  She will never forget those days of hunger and depravation after having wanted for nothing.  
<P>        

Xaria was taught to believe that there is inherent good in everyone.  Sometimes you just have to look a little deeper to find it.  People are always given a fair chance until they abuse her good-hearted nature.  Then it's BEWARE! She decries unfairness and cruelty to others and strives to answer a call for help if the need arises.  She believes that passing along good deeds sent her way is part of the circle of life. 
<P>
She seeks knowledge, for knowledge is the key to answer the questions posed by life. Each and every day, she seeks to learn something new and firmly believes that when the process of learning ends, it will be only because she has received the final summons from her Lord, Bristlebane, asking her to partake at his eternal banquet
<P>
 Xaria met and banded with those that formed a family called The Burning Heart.  Happily she journeyed across the lands on a positive path.  Growing, learning, she moved through life enjoying the companionship of her new-found family. 
<P>
One day, Xaria was sitting in the town center of Rivervale, visiting with many in her family when Shayye Mawr stepped into town with her son in tow.  Hindace was the product of the union between the mighty warrior, Meldryn Mawr and the spritely wood elf, Shayye Mawr.  Filling the entrance to the little town, Hindace soon filled Xaria's life as he filled that entrance.  Where-ever the bard was to be found, Hindace Mawr was certain to be close at hand.  
<P>
This was not met with great pleasure by the head of the Clan Mawr, Meldryn.  He set forth obstacles and tests time and again trying to destroy the budding bond forming between Xaria and Hindace.  The final test came the night of Hindace's Coming of Age Ceremony.  It was then, that Meldryn decreed that if Hindace was to one day become leader of Clan Mawr and take over his sire's position, he would have to set aside his first wife and take a second of the choosing of the Clan.  Xaria, hearing these words, bowed stiffly in the direction of the warrior and then the druid and left the high tower.  Heart broken, not wanting to stand in the path of her beloved's future, she began to run.  Hindace, taking his leave from the ceremony called after her and followed her, vowing his love and devotion, telling her that he would rather spend his days with her, than to lose her to become Clan Leader.  
<P>
It was that night, they pledged themselves to each other and handfasted, binding themselves for time eternal together.  
<P>
That was not to be the end of the trials and tribulations for Xaria and Hindace.  It was not long after that , a monk named Delen found his way to the tavern and talked to Xaria, telling her of his urgent need to find her Lady, Shayye.  Looking at the monk, it was evident that he had met many trials along his journey, ragged, unkempt, his feet bound in bloody rags.   It was during this conversation that he rose, grasping his side and then fell into a coma.  
<P>
When Xaria ran to tell her Lady and Lord of the arrival of Delen, they were shocked, thinking he was dead.  Many hours later and the recounting of many tales, it came forward that Delen had been the tutor of the young child known as Hindace. Taking Hindace out onto the tundra to teach him the ways, one day, they were accosted by snow orcs and bidding Hindace to run, Delen began to fight the orcs.  The last sight Hindace had of Delen was Delen falling beneath the onslaught of the orcs.  
<P>
It was right after this recounting that Shayye left the tavern to sit under her favourite tree.  A scream pierced the air, suddenly, Dekkion was there with Shayye in his arms and a jagged gash on Shayye's leg.  Trembling, telling of the events that transpired, Hindace, in a rage grabbed his bloodforge hammer and yelling, ran out to confront whatever being accosted his mother.  That was to be the last that any saw of Hindace for a great long time.  There was a great commotion within the underbrush and then silence.  The only thing remaining, Hindace's cloak.  
<P>
This was to be a dark period of time for Xaria. Unable to cope with the possibility of another loss in her life, Xaria slipped away into a land of pleasantry and happy memories.  Hanging about the tavern, humming a merry little jig, she waited and watched the door for her beloveds return.  Meldryn and Shayye were at a loss as to what to do.  Several times, Meldryn attempted to set the record straight,but then, at the las minute, staved off, unable to break his daughter-in-laws heart. Eventually, Meldryn could not forgo the truth and one day, brutally sat forth events as they transpired and forced Xaria to face the possibility that Hindace would not be returning.  Heartbroken and then angry, Xaria vowed to do what she could to find her husband and return him home.
<P>
It was found to be that a necromancer by the name of Vinven had taken Hindace.  Until certain events transpired, Hindace had been held safely within the dungeon of the necromaners tower.  It wasn't until the necromancer had been scorned that Hindace was turned over to the relentless appetites of the necromancers servant, Arduatha.  
<P>
One day, Hindace appeared in the vale, dazed and bewildered.  Pale and gaunt. 
His first thought for Xaria, he found her and they found comfort within each others arms.  Xaria was unwilling to let her husband out of sight for a very long time.
<P>
It was shortly after this, Xaria and Hindace formally bound themselves to each other.  Gathering upon the Pavillion in the frozen lands of Everfrost they were joined by family and friends, their numbers exceeding 100.   The ceremony was punctuated by the death rattles of the snow orc known as Redwind and his cohorts as they tried time and again to stop the wedding.  It was said by many that they had not had such a good time at a wedding in a long time..
<P>
As with all things, some things must come to an end and so it was with Hindace and Xaria and The Burning Heart.  Choosing to step down a different path, Xaria and  her husband broke ties with the family they had loved so very dearly and began to walk on their own.  Soon, they were joined by others that had the same goals and ideals.  The numbers continued to grow.  Finally, Hindace told Xaria that he was going to form another family, one that would build upon the values of the Burning Heart, but would be a lasting promise to all.  
<P>
Today, Xaria stands at her husbands side and aids him in whatever way she can.  She has dedicated herself to her husbands dreams and helps him build a new family, The Final Covenant.<BR>
