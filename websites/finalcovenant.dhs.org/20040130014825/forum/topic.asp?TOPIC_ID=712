Very close to home.If we keep forward we can reach it before sundown..."<br /><br />Noracor fastened his pace as even as if he could sence his masters wish before he could even spell it to him...<br />Indeed they were close.Soon they saw the battlements of the rose-like Keep.<br />Man and horse charged in the middle of the road as if some fiendish creature was hunting them.<br /><br />"Cavalier approaching"... shouted the guard above the main Gate.<br /><br />"Which banners does he ride under?" yelled the captain of the guard from below.<br /><br />"Mithaniel Marr's milord... and i think i can see our banner also on his shield" replied the guard.<br /><br />"Raise the portculis!" shouted the captain, "someone lead his horse to the stables and take care of it"...<br /><br />So he crossed the bridge again, his heart beating faster that before.<br />As he dismounted, he wispered some thankfull words to Noracor ears and let the reigns to a men-at-arms.<br /><br />"Hail to thee, Agrivar" he said to the captain<br /><br />"Greetings Griffonheart. How art thee?" <br /><br />"Tired... but i return with Mithaniels blessings. I found what i was seeking"<br /><br />"Very good.I do understand that you are tired but the Lord wishes to speak with you.He ordered us to sent you to him as soon as you were back"<br /><br />"Anounce to him my return.I will be at his office as soon as i change my armor and wear something more formal"<br /><br />....<br /><br />Closing the door behind him, he steped into his room.A pleasant smell reached his nostrils.There, on his bed beside his pellow, was a handfull of white roses.Under them was a purple silken cord.Gently he raised one rose and smelled it while he was looking at the cord.It looked familiar.<br /><br />"Yes... she rides under those colors... Purple colors.." he said to himself.<br />Laying down the rose and the cord, he started removing his plate mail.<br />Reaching in a wooden chest, he pulled off a new suit of chain mail armor and a white winter cloak.As he was dressing up he took the cord and placed it under the chain mail at the place of his heart.<br />Blowing the torch off and taking his sword , he left the room without looking back.<br />...without looking back at the now dark room<br />...at the rose<br />...at the flower that was now slightly different... it had turned black.<br /><br />...<br /><br />He stood in front of the closed door of the Lords office. Following the knights Code and Meassure he knocked thrice but he did not enter.<br /><br />"Come inside" said a soft melodic voice.<br /><br />Gently he pushed the wooden door and entered the room.Closing the door behind him he took 4 steps into the room and bowed deeply.<br /><br />"You summoned me , milord" <br /><br />" yes yes... i wish to speak with you Griffonheart"<br /><br />He could never sence the temper of his Lord.Elves where known for their great wisdom and that they have been granted with  immortality.So their faces never showed up any feelings.<br /><br />"What is it about great Lord?"<br /><br />"As you know , you were away for many days and nights knight.During your absence many things have taken place.I will not bother you with all of them but there is one that i wish to speak to you for.I believe you do know a young squire by the name Lorein"<br /><br />...echoes of battle... horses charging... men screaming in pain...suddenly a heavy lance piereced his heart... lorein... Lorein...<br /><br />"Yes my Lord , i do know the squire you speak off.I have vowed to Mithaniel Marr to be her protector and champion after she saved my life."<br /><br />"Well there is a slightly problem with that matter, Knight. Squire Lorein has been casted away from our orders under the charges of breaking the Code and the Meassure.She was allowed to take her personal items and she left our Keep 1 week ago.She will no longer be under our protection and the next time one of us should encounter her, he should treat her as a stranger."<br /><br />...he reposted to the ogres attack... but as he was ready to strike the deadly blow a greatsword severed both of his legs at knee-hight...<br /><br />"But Lord, which part of the Code did she violated?" he asked ... his voice cracked...<br /><br />"She was seen speaking to a man not worthy of our attencion.A man under our status.A man that is considered our enemy."<br /><br />"But milord... who is that man? i know that Lorein treats our enemies as enemies, i have seen what see can do in battle.So she would never come in friendly terms with one of those..."<br /><br />"You are not to judge my decisions knight.You are to accept them.You have been noticed about her leaving and from now on i expect you to treat her accordingly. You are dismissed."<br /><br />He bowed again and he left the room speachless.<br /><br />....<br /><br />The guard stood watch in the highest post of the battlements.Freezing winds made him cover his shoulders better under his heavy cloak.Suddenly he heard armored steps behind him.<br /><br />"Who goes there? Come closer so i can identify you but keep your hands away from your weapons"<br /><br />"You are relieved of your post soldier.Go to your barracks and rest" said a deep voice under a plate helm.It seemed as if the mans voice came from the deeper layers of hell.<br /><br />"But milord Griffonheart arent you tired? You had a long journey. It is you that you must be resting now." replied the soldier although the thought of a bed and a fireplace made his heart tumbling.<br /><br />"This is an order soldier and you are not to question it.Now go " ...<br /><br />The man-at-arms left his post as quickly as possible.<br /><br />....<br /><br /><br />There he was now.<br />Standing on the battlements.<br />He wasnt cold.<br />That cord under his breastplate seemed to be heating him and keeping him warm.<br />He was all he ever  dreamed to be.<br />A solemn warrior, evils bane, goods champion, helper of the weaks , defender of the poor, first to charge and face the enemy.He had chosen a difficult road to walk.But he have endured all the dangers.Because he was doing what his heart told him to do.He was following Mithaniel Marrs will.He had witnessed discraced knights and their downfall.He even knew that discraced knights still existed in the order he served, masking their actions under the Code and the Meassure.<br />And there he was now standing alone on a place that once seemed friendly... when she was around...<br />But she was gone...<br />...gone because of an order...<br />...gone because she followed what the Code and the Meassure ment for her , and not because of what it meant for the others...<br /><br />He looked at the starlit sky...<br /><br />"Forgive me Great Paladin... because for my first time i do not know what to do.All these years i have served you well.Because even if what i had to do was difficult, the path was lighted by your presence and guideance.But now i stand on a crossroad.For the first time in my life.I do not know what to choose... please forgive me..."<br /><br />....<br /><br />hours passed, he stood there motionless.<br />But a great battle was fought into his body.His heart was dueling his mind.<br /><br />He had to choose...<br />before the sunrise...<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></span id="msg"></font></td>

The small house was under the siege of the weavy rain but it withstanded it just fine...<br /><br />Inside a small bearder figure moved through the shadows throwing another log into the fireplace...<br /><br />"Damn that weather... I should have never left my home in Thurgandin"...<br /><br />Blowing his nose noisily he threw his aged body on a comfortable armchair.<br /><br />"Well, if i am not allowed to sleep maybe i can spend my time doing something else." said the old dwarf reaching for a carving knife and a piece of wood.<br />Though those were not the tools of his profession he loved wood-carving. When he was not at the company of his forge and his hammer , he carved finely figures on wood. All the furnishing and the sculpture inside his small house witnessed it.<br /><br />Watching the flames consuming the log in the fireplace his hands run over the small piece of wood with love, just before he started carving it...<br /><br />-----------------<br /><br />Say will you dream of me tonight under moonless skies.... a final dream within the shadows...<br /><br />--------------<br /><br />He was staring the flames dancing over the almost comsumed for too long now, when the old dwarfs eyes widened in surprise...<br /><br />The dancing flames have formed the figure of a handsome man clad in plate mail armor.Only his head was uncovered.Blonde hair run over his shoulders, like a waterfall...<br />The burning figure noded at him<br /><br />"Greetings Boldaim... I see that time has treated you well olf dwarf.Please listen to me because i will only say this once. Three moons from now you will be visited by a man who has lost his way.You are to present him with your finest creation."<br /><br />Fumbling with the items he was holding, Boldaim stared into the flaming figure which was staring to fade away.<br /><br />"But who will that man be? And who are you? What am i to present to him?" he managed to say in his surprise...<br /><br />"Well... " said the figure gently "i have many names... dwarves,elevs,gnomes,halflings have many names for me.But i am fond of the one humans use... Truthbringer"... <br /><br />The flames died down... <br />But the surprises didnt...<br />Boldaims vision went over to the piece of wood he was carving for so many hours... He picked it up...<br />There in his hand stood the figure of a knight clad in black battle armor, his breastplate decorated with black roses with long thorns.Around them a silken purple cord wieved a strange pattern...<br /><br />"By the thousent warhammers, ill be damned" he wispered at himself. Still looking at the wooden knight he reached with his other hand to remove the burned log and make space for another one.But what his hand closed on wasnt burned wood.It wasnt even warm by the fireplace.Wood has given its place into some strange black ore.<br />Noding his head in disbelief, he took the black ore and the wooden figure...<br />Cursing the weather he steped outside his house to a smaller building next to it...<br /><br />That night all the denizens of the Rathe mountains could swear that above the sounds of the frenzied wind and the storm, the sound of steel against steel echoed...<br /><br />----------<br /><br />My Honor is my Life...<br /><br />----------<br /><br />At the same time in a place not very far away from there... a portcullis was raised.<br /><br />"He must be crazy..." wispered a guard to the men that were pulling the weavy chains that lowered the brisge of the castle, as if he was afraid that the armored knight that was ridding the big black heavy warhorse could hear him over the raging winds...<br /><br />"I believe he is.." replied another one.. " Did you see his eyes through the visor of his Helm? I can swear that those are not the eyes of a sane man.."<br /><br />"But he just returned... " said a young squire... "Look at him and his horse... and that armor... that armor is so old, just like the one my grandfather used to describe to me , that the Great Lords in the Halls of Truth had the privilege to posses..."<br /><br />"He looks like he is hunting something... and he doesnt want that something to get away from him..." <br /><br />"Clear his way, let him pass.." said an old guard...<br />Noding a guantleted finger at the last who has spoken he said... "Even if he is hunting something... the last thing i would like now would be to stand between him and that something.."<br /><br />As soon as the lower end of the wooden bridge layed on the other end of the chasm, man and horse charged out side the Keep.<br />Like a demon that has awaken and wants to flex his muscles they rode outside... Just 200 yards away from the keep , they turned to face the castle. Horse raised in its behind legs in a mark of disapproval towards his master that ordered it to turn.<br />The knight raised the lance with the colors of Mithaniel Marr and the banner of the Keep.Waving it into the air thee times he drove the lance into the wet ground. Noding his head twice the warhorse acknowledged the cavaliers wish and returned towards the road...<br />Man and horse disaapeared into the darkness...<br /><br />As of some insane God was looking on Norrath that night, noone from the creatures that live and walk in the darkness dared to cross paths with the riding figure<br />Both living beings seemed locked with each other as they rode in the night...<br />...followin...<br />....<br />the smell of black roses...<br /><br />--------- <br /><br />Say willyou dream of me tonight... under moonless skies... <br /><br />---------<br /><br />The winds... The rain... his body in pain but he kept riding...<br />Voices wispered in his head...<br /><br />"We wonder the road sometimes...<br />Green forests,stars, and stories...<br />a secret time under three moons<br /><br />We walk the clouds sometimes<br />and ride on dragon fairies...<br />a drink with friends under three moons...<br /><br />Say will you dream with me tonight...<br /><br />And then we turn around <br />and find the forests gone<br />and find the stars and stories gone..<br />And then we turn around<br />and find the fairies gone..<br />and find the dragon fairies gone...<br /><br />Say will you dream with me tonight..."<br /><br />"... Yes my love... i will dream with you... wait for me... i am coming there..."<br />i<br />am<br />coming...<br /><br /><br />The heart has won...</span id="msg"></font></td>

Under normal circumstances , he would have been into his small house now, drinking his ale next to the warm fireplace.But the fur trade was the only thing that would keep his belly full and his skin warm and dry, and business has been very bad this winter.<br /><br />  Cursing the weather and the snow that has been falling for the last week covering the tracks of the brown bears he was hunting, he kept moving higher into the mountains.Suddenly as he took the next step, he found himself falling flat faced into the snow.<br /><br />"Tunare damn all the broken bowstrings, what the hell is it this time.." he muttered under his teeth as he tried to assemble himself and stand up. Embaraced he looked around, expecting to hear a mocking laughter from someone familiar, but he remembered that he was alone on this hunting expedition. Sighing loudly, he tried to find out what was the cause of his fall. There, half buried under the snow stood a big piece of shining metal. Unfortunatly, by the angle it was buried it was almost invisible inside the snow, one had to come sideways to see it.<br /><br />Droping to his knees, and leaving aside his longbow and quiver, he cleared the snow off the shining object. Examining it closely now, he realised that it was a bit familiar.<br /><br />"I'll be damned and turned to a frog, if this isnt horse plate barding..." he said loudly. A few glares around revieled him more metalic pieces. <br /><br />"What the hell is going on. One must be very stupid to cross these mountains with a horse in full barding. Or desperate enough"<br /><br />His late discovery woke up his curiousity. The bears wouldnt go anywhere. After all, so many years close to this territory, he considered his responsibility to partol the mountains and the lake close by, and be sure that everything was going on in natures way.<br />Raising up in haste, he grabed his bow and secured it behind his back.<br />Raising his gloved finger , he brought it to his forehead and closed his eyes. Feeling the magic flow within him, he wispered the same arcane words that have saved his life so many times as he brought to his mind the image of a wild and powerful wolf. Waving his hand into a strange pattern in the air, a mystical symbol appeared out of nowhere, it flashed once and dissapeared.Feeling the magic flowing within his body, he started to run. As his light leather boots touched the snow, one could swear he was more flying than running, leaving no prints on the fresh snow bed that has covered the Rathe mountains that winters morning....<br /><br />Edited by - Griffonheart Solamnus on 11/11/2002  09:10:21</span id="msg"></font></td>

As the creatures that take residence on the Rathe mounts and love and embrace the darkness were slowly opening their eyes, a howl broke the silence...<br />Then another, which was answered by yet another...<br />The wolves decided the time has come, hunger driving them mad.<br /><br />Noracor was cold and thirsty. Multiple wounds were covering his proud body, some of them even open. His blood was slowly spilling on the snow, and with it, his power too.The horse was a fierce opponent for the wolves. A dozen wolve bodies laying dead on the sheet of snow witnessed that fact.But the beasts have been patient. Slowly weakening the stalion, denying it sleep and rest, they were waiting for the time to strike. And all this time, the horse never left his masters side. Next to it, lay still the body of a plate armored figure, half covered in snow.Inside his gauntleted fist, could be seen a purple cord....<br /><br />The next howl was met by the wolves appearance. Slowly aproaching in a cresent formation, the beasts red eyes were focused on Noracor. The stalion raised its body in his behind legs in a defiant stance, and stood its ground...<br /><br />Rainstalker was literaly flying. His instict was urging him to move with haste, as he was discovering more left overs on the mountain later. Saddle bags, spare equipment... a riding saddle...<br />The tracks were showing him that the rider was on foot now, not wanting to push his faithfull animal more and cause its death.<br /><br />"I have to be getting close.Tunare guide me " .. he wispered. Then the first howl reached his ears.Cold sweat run down his spine. He knew this howl. Dire wolves closing on their cornered prey. Then he heard the second, and the third one...<br />Rushing forward like a mad demon, he removed his longbow from his back.He could see the scene clearly now.A horse backing slowly , keeping more than two dozen wolves at bay. But it was mortaly wounded, old scars on his legs reopened each time it was taking another step.Calmly but quickly he drove 6 arrows to the ground next to him as he knelt to one knee. <br />"Tunare guide my hand.", he prayed , as he let loose his first messanger of death. The arrow flew true, piercing the first wolves hide, passing though ribs and finally reaching its heart. The beast grinned and fell, motionless.In the blink of an eye, the second arrow struck, this time going through a wolves eye and crsuhing his scull on its way out.The rest of the beasts backed off a bit, but their hunger was too great to abandon such a feast. A third and fourth arrow met their victims, two more wove modies fell on the snow. Deudred threw back his head and let out an unearthy howl, a message to the predators that stood there, that this night they would have to seach for a new prey. The wolves backed up some more, then slowly turned and dissapeared in the cover of darkness, teeth bared nad grining.<br /><br />Leaving his bow aside, the ranger stood up slowly. <br />"This might prove challenging... " , he smiled to himself. He had heard about the trained warhorses loyalty to their master, and this particular warhorse was even more fierce than the best breed he had ever seen in his half elven life.He started to approach it, slowly, carefully, one hand extented infront of him as a sign of peace. Whispering soothing words, those that would even calm down the wildest animal, he reached the stalion.While it was backing away, it let the ranger touch his head and embrace it lovingly. Without stoping speaking to the animal, Deudred reached to a pouch that hanged from his belt and removed a mixture of green leaves,white dust and some strange liquid.Careful with one hand, he applied it to the animals open wounds.Stroking the stalions head steadily, his eyes searched the snow for any signs of its master. Then he saw the body laying close to him.Beside it was a big mark on the snow, a sign that the horse was laying close trying to keep its master warm.<br /><br />"Now lets see if he is still aliv-"... Hadnt been his superior reflexes he wouldnt have the time to avoid the deadly hoof. He rolled carefuly on the snow, and in a blink he was standing, his hand locked on the hilt of his longswod.The stalion was standing between him and the body, its eyes on him.<br /><br />Slowly he removed his hand , and smiled slightly...<br />"I understand you my friend.." he wispered, "but i will not harm your master..". He moved closer to it, "Allow me to tend to him as I did to you.."<br />Stroking the horses back , he knelt beside the body, fully knowing that the horse was still watching him carefully. He rolled the man over, and removed his great helm. On his moustache there were tiny bits of ice. Deudred removed his leather glove and reached to the mans neck, under his plate gorget.<br /><br />"Tunare be praised, by the thousand springs..." he said with surprise... "He is still alive..."<br /><br />Edited by - Griffonheart Solamnus on 11/11/2002  09:11:35</span id="msg"></font></td>

Before him, stood a black warhorse and next to it, a figure clad in a beautiful black plate mail. The sun was stroking the carved breastplate, where one could recognize a thorny rose and a cord weaving a strange pattern around it.<br />  The armored figure dropped to his knee and bowed his head slightly in revere.<br /><br /> "Boldaim, I have no words to describe my feelings for you and what you did for me. If you are ever in a ..."<br /><br />  The ancient dwarf took two paces forward and brought his strong hand upon the mans shoulderguard.<br /><br /> "Nae mention it , lad. Whate't did, ae did in the name of Brell. Lads like ye are tough te find, like a flawless diamond in a mine of silver."<br /><br />  Stroking his beard with his other hand he continued..<br /><br /> "Then again it might be sometin ta do fer me , lad. Tell Delmair that I'll be waitin his worthless dwarven hide te come'ere and talk'bout things of old. Tell'm I got som'strong dwarven ale and all the time in the world."<br /> <br />  The old dwarf chuckled as he removed his hand...<br /><br /> "Now, be on yer way lad, ye have lots ta do. And remember... " he said in a deep voice as the armored figure mounted...<br /> "Seek and ye shall find lad.. Seek and ye shall find..."<br /><br />  The armored figure noded and gave the Knights salute to a friend, turned his mount towards the path and rode away into the morning suns light. The dwarf kept his vision locked on mand and horse until they both became tiny dots on the green bed of Rathe mounts. He brought to his mind the image of a half elven ranger carrying that young man in his arms and the wounded horse next to him that appeared one day into the middle of the heavy winter outside his small house. He has been expecting them, a burning figure had warned him before. Noe , the man fully recovered was riding outside, clad in dwarven made armor and carrying an ancient twohanded sword...<br /><br /><br /> "Karar bea Brell... " he wispered slowly as he wiped a small tear with the back of his hand...

He seemed to be dressed in some kind of military uniform and he was walking in a slow and steady pace. He was holding something in his arms, it was more of a someone though...<br />A hand was across his shoulders and a pair of finely curved legs could be seen , extending at the side of his right arm.He watched carefully as the figure aproached slowly a large bed and layed the body upon the white sheets. It was a young girl in her low twenties, her face almost covered from a waterfall of blonde hair. She wasnt moving at all.<br /><br />He walked slowly towards the bed, a bad taste reached his mouth and he stirred slightly as if an imaginary hand squized his stomach.<br /><br />Now the man was sitting on the bed next to the girl, which was covered in a blue silken robe, decorated with familiar symbols. Mythaniel Marrs. The twist in his stomach was getting hander and harder as he came closer and stopped next to the bed. <br />Something was telling him to pull away from there, to stop looking , but it seemed as if his legs had a will of their own and kept him pinned there. <br />The mans right hand reached to her chin and stroked it slightly revealing her face, a familair face from the past, one not to be seen many a moons ago.<br />He felt his heart stop beating as an unearthly howl came upon his lungs... <br /><br /> "NOOOoooooo............"<br /><br />He woke up, covered in sweat, both of his hands locked upon the sides of the small wooden bed, the blood veins on his neck were swollen, as if ready to explode. The howl was still echoing in his ears as he shook his head violently trying to chase away the image that had caused this.<br />Covering his head with his hands, he tried to bring himself into control..<br />Slowly, he stood up and walked towards a small bucket of water. Taking two handfulls he threw it in his face. The cold water felt good, waking him up fully within seconds. A small glance outside revealed that the night was just starting to fall. Giving a silent prayer that noone had awaken to investigate the cause of the howl, he started to don his armor. <br />The night was till young, and there was pleanty of time to reach the Oasis of Marr, before the temperature had dropped low enough to make traveling impossible.The thought of the sea he so loved to visit along with his father when he was a younger boy , made him focus and work faster.Like an old veteran full of battle scars who was used to work without a canddles light, he was done within minutes. Reaching to his belt pouch he removed two platinum pieces and left them on the pillow along with a prayer for the denizens of the camp who were kind enough to allow him rest in one of their tents. <br />Walking outside, he found Noracor standing next to the tent, nodding his head slightly as his right front hoove was digging into the sand.<br /><br />Smiling to himself, he reached for the reigns of his faithful mount and he strapped on the saddle. <br /><br />"Thank you for watching over me yet another night my friend. Most kind of you "  he wispered to the horse as he started walking beside it, reigns in his right hand, helm in the other.<br /><br />Moving silently between the tents, he noticed two pair of eyes staring at him. Turning to face em, he found a small boy standing next to a tent holding a wooden toy sword almost as big as him. Next to it was a beautiful young girl with a handfull of night lilys in her embrace.Both of em were not older than a decade...<br /><br />As he passed close to them he felt their eyes penetrating him as a wave of security, warmth and power overwelmed him. He stood there for a moment, looking back at the two kinds, then silently turning ahead resuming his course...<br /><br />When he was well away of them, the girl turned to face the boy with an angry look in her eyes. <br /><br />"Dear brother what have you done to this man? I sence great sorrow within him."<br /><br />The boy was still staring at the knights figure as he spoke slowly...<br /><br />"I have done nothing to him , my dear sister.His destiny is his own, you know. I just gave it a gentle push..."<br /><br />"A gentle push?!? " The girl was now hodling her flowers in one hand and was nodding her other to the boy.She was unearthly beautiful and calm...<br /><br />"His loyalties stand with you until his last breath. Yet you insist on breaking him. Why? "<br /><br />"He needs to be broken , sister. For what awaits him ahead, needs him strong , not only in body but in soul too. And speaking of that, what interest is of yours in him? I thought you were too buzy playing with that wood elf who was trying to enter our barbarian culture to take notice on anything else."<br /><br />The girl gave a toyful stroke with her flowers at the boys chest.<br /><br />"It matters me, you know. Because what you do, involves someone else, who is out in your name too."<br /><br />The boy turned and smiled warmly towards her, his eyes the eyes of a ten year old were filled with the wisdom of ages. <br /><br />"He will be a valuable piece in the chessboard, sister. Now that he will be broken, he will be the perfect tool for the plans."<br /><br />He started walking slowly..<br /><br />The girl starred at him for a while, then a broad smile crossed her face.<br /><br />"So you think, brother. But there is something that you dont count , in your masterfull plans. Love will find a way.. Love always finds a way.."<br /><br />Kissing the lilys, she scattered them to the winds and started walking behind him..<br /><br />As the lilys pedals were drifting in the nights breeze, a soft song broke the nights silence..<br /><br />  No Love,<br />  No Truth,<br />  No nothing, <br />  You dont exist<br />  Not anymore<br />  The sun rises again ending the world where it began.<br />  Is there anything left?<br /><br />...<br /><br /><br />He was not yet done.</span id="msg"></font></td>
