<P><br>
<P><br>
<font size=+1>
Please be aware that you are carrying the banner of The Final Covenant.  As such conduct yourself in a way as to bring pride to the Final Covenant. Your behaviour reflects back upon the rest of the guild.<BR><br>
1.Airing of grievances with another guild member in a public forum will not be tolerated.<br><br>
2.Respect and courtesy towards each other will be enforced. That means, arguements and disagreements will be held in tells or private modes of communication.  This applies in our interactions both in guild and with non-guild individuals.  If you can not resolve the disagreement, call in an officer to assist in the mediation.  No shouts or ooc arguments across a zone will be tolerated.<br><br>
3. Inflammatory posts towards another member of the Final Covenant  upon The Final Covenant's Message board or any other message board will not be tolerated.<BR><BR>
4.Refrain from public bashing of Verant/EQ.  There are other venues that are appropriate for these matters.<BR><BR>
5.Officers within the Final Covenant have a greater responsibility to uphold the guidelines that will be set in place. <BR><BR>
6.We are here to help and assist each other. But, please, do not abuse that kindness we have towards another.  Make sure it is a need and not a want.<BR><BR>
7. The Final Covenant and members of The Final Covenant will not knowingly engage in any activity that is an exploit.  To do so will be grounds for guild removal<BR><BR><BR>
