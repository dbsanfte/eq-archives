<Font size=+1><center><I>The earliest memory she has is the smell of the dry, dusty cave, the sound of howling winds and the warmth of four furry bodies curled up next to her in the compact wolf den that she first called home.  Ambeaux had no memories of tribe or family and since wolves keep time and history differently than two-leggers, she had no real idea of how she'd come to be adopted by the large grey she-wolf.  All of her earliest reckonings contained her four wolf brothers--hours spent cuddling and playing and sharpening her teeth and her wits against them--and the only mother she'd ever known.<P>

Growing more slowly than her adopted whelps, Ambeaux's stay in the wolf den long outlasted her litter mate's and, indeed, the few litters that followed.  Some instinct or unspoken intelligence was at work in her mother that Ambeaux wasn't eventually run out of the cave like each successive litter to make room for the next.  In exchange for the shelter and ongoing protection, she learned to use her human hands to heal and bind pups that fractured legs and to rub warmth and life into the pups that were stillborn.  In the 10 years that she lived with the she-wolf, each litter born to the little wolf den reached adulthood intact.  While Nature often claimed the lives of the weak or the unlucky, Ambeaux's gifts for healing and life granted her many siblings life where they might have had none.
<P>
One night in Ambeaux's tenth winter, the she-wolf--barren for the first time since her cycles could give life--returned to the cave with a gaping wound in her side.  An encounter with hunters had marked her and some unseen force intervened to spare her long enough for her to return to the den and to her daughter.  Keening while she worked (raised among wolves she had never learned to cry), Ambeaux called on every gift she'd ever known to try to heal and repair the wound but despite her skill and the power in her small hands, the blood could not be staunched and the she-wolf died in her arms. 
<P>
In spite of the snow and winds outside, the two-legged hunters were able to trace the trail of blood to the small cave.  The moaning from inside made them pause in fear and it wasn't until Ambeaux stumbled out of the cave mouth--covered in blood and howling--that the hunters realized the sound was human.  Recovering from their shock they forgot about their prey and subdued the girl--wrapping her in furs and taking turns carrying her--and took her back to their small encampment.   
<P>
Ambeaux was unreachable.  Unable to communicate and lost somewhere within herself and her grief, she took no notice of the clothes that were put on her or the fire she was placed in front of.  She ignored the stew that was given her and occasionally unnerved the whole camp when she broke into bouts of uncontrolled howling.  At a loss, the hunting party decided to cut short their trip and return to the City of Halas.  Their hope was to leave the strange wolf-girl with the Healers there.
<P>

<P>
It took many months under the watchful care of the head wise woman before Ambeaux would take notice of her surroundings or respond to attempts of communication.  
<P>
The next few years were lonely ones for the half-wild girl who slowly learned the disconcerting ways of human speech.  Her progress was impeded by her confusion when confronted with people who would speak words that did not meet the message their bodies, movements and smells betrayed.  She did not understand the pain or the fear that many of these two-leggers carried around with them while they smiled and talked as though they were fine.  Finally she became discouraged and took to spending long (and quiet) hours studying the ways of the Mystics and the Healers in Halas.
<P>
Many of their methods she recognized and, over time, Ambeaux lended her quiet, confident assistance in matters of healing and childbirth.  Possessing the ability to soothe and calm even the most panicked patients, her presence was soon sought by the most skilled shaman and physicians and Ambeaux's knowledge of healing plants, methods and other arts became more and more refined and eventually surpassed her most experienced mentors.  Soon many of the sick or injured of Halas began to seek her out for treatment and healing.  Before long this began to breed resentment among her teachers and even her strongest advocates and eventually isolated her even more.
<P>
Moving to a small deserted hut on the edge of the city, Ambeaux quietly cared for the few who sought her out for treatment and took payment only in what she would need to live.  
<P>
One day in her 16th season, she found a half-dead stranger on her doorstep.  Bringing the unconscious woman into her hut, Ambeaux labored for several days--barely stopping to eat--to save her.  Finally her wounds began to heal and the woman slowly regained awareness.  With marks on her arms and face and large plugs and various rings in her ears, the woman was unlike anyone Ambeaux had ever seen before.  As the woman recovered she began speaking in a language unknown to the young healer.
<P>
For several months the woman stayed with Ambeaux and gradually Ambeaux was able to make out parts of her story.
<P>
Wedo had lived on a small island in warm seas (something Ambeaux did not know existed) with her mother, the village leader.  Many of the traditions of her people were steeped in magic and Wedo had been taught all of the magicks and powers that would befit the daughter of a great leader.  Often, delegations would leave their island and travel to other parts of the world in search of knowledge of other peoples and cultures.  These delegations would eventually return and share their experiences (which would be scribed) and this information exchange strengthened the tribe and helped their culture grow.  One day Wedo was put in charge of one such delegation and set sail for Northern waters.  Many of her delegates perished in the harsh Northern weather and when they finally put ashore only Wedo and four others left the boat to search for other people.  A small crew stayed behind to repair and guard the ship.  The small party was soon lost in the icy lands and during a storm Wedo, separated from her group, wandered alone until she collapsed mere feet from Ambeaux's door.
<P>
Enticed by Wedo's story, Ambeaux gathered her things and dressed her new friend in furs and hides and the two set out for the ocean shore.  After several days they reached the ship and Wedo was reunited with her crew and the delegates who'd made their way back in the storm.  Soon they were under sail and Ambeaux found herself welcomed for the first time by these strange people with their beautiful jewelry and tattoos.  During the voyage she picked up many of the words of their lyrical language and Wedo began to teach her to call upon energy from the organic material around her and Ambeaux found that she could use this knowledge to strengthen her healing skills.  After a few weeks at sea the island Wedo called home came into sight and Ambeaux braced herself to begin her new life there.<P></font></center></i>
