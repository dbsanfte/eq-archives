<Font size=+2><i>Alander's background is not quite known. He was born in a gypsy camp in North Karana. Yet the father is unknown.
He is half-elf. When he was very young, Wolfrydr had came to the camp to conduct some "business" and discovered
the lad. After some discussion, he was allowed to take Alander with him. The physical features between Alander and
Wolfrydr are quite remarkable. Highbulp was the first to notice this. And when he looks at the two, he just grins,
shakes his head and walks away. Highbulp seems to understand the truth of the origins of the young ranger, but has
kept the secret to this day.
<P>
Alander was trained by Wolfrydr in the skills of a druid. But the lad's heart leaned to that of a warrior. With skill of a
druid, Alander chose the path of a ranger. This, he felt, was a good mix of both worlds. 
<P>
He still is mastering the skills of a warrior and a druid</font></i>
