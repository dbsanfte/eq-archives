<h1><i>So,thee hast found us...</i></h1>
<blockquote><blockquote>
<h2><i>NOW what???</i></h2>
<p>
<P>
"Prithee, dear adventurer, pull up a bench and warm thyself in front of the fires whilst I tell thee that which must be accomplished before admittance into The Final Covenant.  The reason we ask this of one that is interested in our family is that we must make sure we both suit each other.  Our family thee and thee, us.  For, if the suitability is not there, then none are happy and great disharmony and discord arise.  This does not benefit any."
<p>
<P>

The bard smiles gently at you and moves to the fire place and settles down upon the stool there and begins to softly strum upon her lute...
<p>
<P>
"If thou hast come this far, then it shall be taken for granted thou hast read our charter and are in accord with the words therein.  It shall be asked of thee to then visit our message boards and there, leave a scroll introducing thyself to us, telling us who thou art, thou intentions and goals."
<p>
<P>
"Whilst we are in the process of re-evaluating our admission process, there are a few basic steps one must take at this time.<P><P>
1. One must have trained a minimum of 10 times before their guild master.  They must have been summoned 10 more times for training before becoming a full vassal within the guild. This is an attempt to decrease the level disparity so one may be able to group with those within the family."<P>
<P>
<P>
2.  A completed biography of ones life and history must be submitted to the Family.  It needs not be elaborate.<P>
<P>
<P>
3.  It is encumbant upon the Page to the Final Covenant to contact and arrange to meet with each officer within the Final Covenant.  In turn, it is encumbant upon each Guild Officer to accomoadate the page within a reasonable and timely manner.  Each officer may or may not require a task from the page.  
<p>
<P>
"After a suitable amount of time has passed; and this time is dependant upon how often and how long thee interacts with other members of the family; the council assembles to vote upon thy status within the family.  At that time, thou art either a full fledged Vassal or, informed that, perhaps we do not suit what thou art seeking and perhaps another guild or family would be better suited for thy needs."
<p>
<P>
"Once a vassal within the guild, thee must do but a few things to maintain thy status. One of which all are required to take up a trade/skill and become master at least one. It does not need to be done over night, but worked on.  It is in this way, we can best help each other and others that we encounter on our daily adventures within the realm of Norrath.  We would like to become known as THE trades guild within Norrath."
<p>
<P>
Smiling, the bard sets aside her lute and stands up.
<p>
<P>
"I do so hope this helps thee in thy journey to our family.  Good Luck to thee adventurer!!"
<p>
<P>
Pausing, the bard stops and turns to look at you again... 
<P>
<P>
"OOH!! If thou hast questions and I am not to be found in Norrath, or any other member of the council, please, send a messenger with a scroll to this address....  xaria@finalcovenant.dhs.org  . I shall endeavour to answer it as clearly and concisely as possible. Again.. Merry Meet, Merry Part, Merry Shall We Meet Again!!!"
