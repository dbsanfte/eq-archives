Planar Robes, Breastplates, High end encounter Quest armour pieces will be subject to distribution by the Guild Leadership. In those instances where these items are obtained while on a guild raid, the guild leader, and in the absence of the guild leader, an officer will assign those particular pieces.  If there is no officer in attendance, the Raid Leader will then determine distribution.<BR> 
<P>
It is expected that if a raid is started prior to the arrival of an officer, leadership of the raid will be turned over to the Officer in Attendance as well as looting rights.<BR>  
<P>
<P>
<BR>
The short and simple of the Loot Policy goes as follows..<BR>
*Loot goes to those that can and will equip first.<BR> 
*Class loot always goes to a member of that class.<BR> 
*If no one in group can or will equip it then that item should be offered to one that can/will in the guild.<BR> 
*If none of the above makes sense random.<BR>
*Mains will be given primary consideration over secondaries, unless the secondary was specifically asked to be in attendance.<br>
<P>
<P>
When we have guests along.. They will be allowed to random along with the rest of the group there. Class groupings included.
<P>
<P>
<P>
It is expected that if on a guild raid, the items earned on the raid would stay within the guild. I would not like to think that someone would random on an item against another in the family that would use it then turn around and sell it the very next day 
<P>
<P>
<P><BR>
<center>1 or 2 guild groupings where we are going on a specific raid.</center>
<P>
<P>
Those that can use, that are in attendance at the raid, get first choice on the item.. There will be a random on the item between those of the specific class(es) involved that are interested. (The exception being stated in regards to high end encounters. See above exception.) If not, it is randomed between all that wish the item. At that time a trade will be effected. i.e., if the item that is being replaced is not no drop, it is to be handed over to an officer within the guild. That item will be held for another within the guild that can use or to be awarded as a prize or recognition for outstanding performance within the family.
<P>
<P>
<P><BR>
Individual groupings and experience groups can decide amongst themselves as to how loot will be distrubted.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<BR>
Rewards for Service to the Family will be handled in a different manner. i.e., in game guild meeting and public recognition of service tendered. 
<P>
<P><P><BR>
*This policy is in effect for GUILD ONLY raids of two groups or more and the items referred to are those items that are acquired on guild raids. We do not expect you to hand over items that you acquired on your own or were gifted to you by another. I.e., You recieve a breastplate from a guild raid. You upgrade that Breastplate. You would be expected to hand over the Breastplate A you recieved at the guildraid to another in the family. It stays within the guild. When handing over the breastplate you explain that it is family property and needs to stay within the family.*
