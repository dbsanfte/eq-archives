<img src="axe_2.jpg" align=left><Font Size=+1><I>I am Mohanrai Moriancumr a historian and scribe assigned by my order to the study of Meldryn Mawr, I have earned Meldryn trust and have served him as his personal advisor for neigh to 30 years in exchange I have been allowed access to clan record that have never before been seen or read by outsiders and have been privy to his most private of meeting and decisions.  Though Meldryn is fluent in languages and is a talented scribe of mystical writings he has asked me to write a short Biography of him to be placed witting the records of the Burning Heart.  In no way is this a small task, I have complied many volumes about Meldryn in my detailed study of him.  Also there are a few other writers who have made lengthy records about Meldryn.  With this in mind I shall give you a very brief raw look into the life of Meldryn Mawr, but in no way can one gain a true understanding of this man by this brief summary.
<P>
Meldryn Mawr born unto the Mawr Clan as second son and third child of the chieftain Celdryn Mawr but Eldest child of the first wife and thus blood heir of the clan.  At the time of his birth the clan centered on the Island of Nujel'm.  Nujel'm has always been a land of riches and wealth.  Never has Lord British ever been able to enforce any of his laws or regulations on this island.  Over 300 years ago the Mawr migrated to the lands of Sosaria and settled a region of wilderness thought to be unclaimed.  However it was lands of a local lord who labeled the clan as outlaws and poachers and a small battle took place between Mawr clansmen and a combined force of Mercenaries and soldiers of the ruler of Sosaria an ancestor to the now reigning Lord British. Ever since then the Mawr clan has been considered outlaws by the Brittish family.  Forced to live a life of outlaws the Clan to their demise became involved with group of Pirate on the raise in power.  And so we find the Mawr clan though very wealthy and owners of many trading vessels and trade routs subject to the Pirate king Vestril who at the time of Meldryns birth is using the Mawr clans trading companies as a front for pirated goods and taking many young men of the clan to serve on his pirate ships. 
<P>
For over 400 years the heart, pride and treasure of the Mawr clan has been its bloodline rich with fierce berserk warriors.  The blood of the berserk is and has always been considered sacred to the clan.  The blood of each child at birth is put to three test Fire Ice and Earth.  And though I have never seen the test the clan has a council of elders who are very skilled and trained in the reading of these test or blood rites and they supposedly can prophesy to some extent the life and future of a child.  I have read the prophesy of Meldryn and I to this day still do not understand the intricate details of his blood rites but I understand how and why the council had great concern over the results of his test.  Meldryn tested to be of pure berserk blood to a degree that causes an extremely high mortality rate.  The council also saw great strengths and potential in Meldryn from these tests.  The council approached Celdryn and told him that his son Meldryn would not be expected to live through his childhood unless given sever training in discipline and control over his berserk nature.  Celdryn with loving concern agreed to the councils request.    
<P>
The council considered Meldryn practically a lost cause and thus expendable.  They planed a desperate attempt to use the possible potential they saw in Meldryns test to their on plans.  Meldryn would be a desperate and risky experiment in molding and shaping a child to their will.  Implanting into this child total devotion to the clan and strict discipline, which they hoped to control and use as a pawn to overthrow Vestrils power over the clan.  I'll not expound on what they put the child through but suffice it to say the child was never allowed contact from his mother.  And was raised in near total isolation from any other children and denied any emotional contact with anyone.  He was taught that emotions were flaws in men that corrupted and distorted judgement.  He was taught to be cold and very calculating in all dealings.
<P>
Some where between the age of 8 and 12 Meldryn managed to develop a secret friendship with Teancum a son of a member of the council.  Teancum would eventually become Meldryns closest confidant companion and captain of Meldryns personal army and quite possibly the only man to truly ever understand Meldryn though his loyalty to Meldryn is such that he has never discussed Meldryn with anyone to my knowledge. 
<P>
At the age of 12 the leaders subjected Meldryn to a very twisted version of the three tests they give young warriors usually of age 16-19 to win the rights of adulthood.  The test typically last less than one season of the weather and prepare the youth to accept and take up responsibility and confidence to see them through their adult lives.  Meldryn test were so difficult that they took 6 years to complete.  I believe that it was during these tests that the council lost control of Meldryn and created a force beyond their control.  The third and final test for Meldryn began around the age of 15.  In brief the council gave Meldryn a false name and sold him to the Pirate king Vestril as a supposed thief and trouble maker that would make either a good slave or battle fodder for Vestrils pirate ships.  Their instructions or test that they instructed Meldryn with was to Come to know then clans enemy Vestril in such an intimate way and to return to them only when he of a certainty had the knowledge to give them a means to defeat and or rid themselves of Vestrils oppression.  Three years later Meldryn turned Vestrils officers into a blundering chaos of rivalries that shattered Vestrils control of the seas turning his armada into rival bands fighting each other over the spoils of the Pirate kings empire.  Meldryn at this time of confusion appeared before the council and declared his test complete, his training at there hand over and that he had joined into an Alliance with Vestrils son Jintu also know as the Bard Daylar founder of The Burning Heart. For through Daylar and the BH, lay the way to remain free of Vestrils reign.
<P>
The council soon formed an alliance with another clan and a treaty was agreed upon and as a show trust between the two clans the daughter of the Chief of the other clan was to be given in marriage to Meldryn the day after the joining of the alliance.  The Festival of alliance turned into a pre-wedding feast and Celdryn announced that upon Meldryn wedding day leadership of the clan would be passed to his son Meldryn.  Meldryn had no problem with marriage and looked to it as his duty to pass on the sacred clan bloodline.  However during the festivities Meldryn and Teancum were summoned by the Rogue Kishkuman.  Kish lead Teancum and Meldryn to a hiding place where they observed a secret meeting of several council members with leaders of the other clan.  Following the meeting the three followed Teancums father to his house where he hid several documents from the meeting.  The three later stole those documents which revealed a secret plot and conspiracy.  Meldryn quickly laid out a plan and Teancum vowed his loyalty to Meldryn and that night the set in motion many events.
<P>
That night they abducted Meldyns bride to be and revealed unto her the plot of the council and she agreed to their plan and they secretly were wedded in the night and then divorced.  Meldryn then disappeared.  The next morning Meldryn disappearance caused much commotion.  The two clans both blamed each other for things and the group of secret conspirators who were suppose to be a special council to over see the running of both clan for the first 2 years of Meldryns reign were at odds and contended one with another.  In the end clansmen of the two clans lost all trust and faith in each other.
<P>  
  Over the following two years Teancum slowly recruited young warriors to him carefully selecting them and swearing them to secrecy.  Meldryn joined the Burning Heart and took over several abandoned mines and began a moderately successful mining operation.  Next he turned his efforts to pirates brigands and outlaws whom he had become aquainted with during his three years on Vestrils ships.  He put together a band of fairly honorable outlaws and ex pirates and they began to hunt pirates.  Particularly pirates who were hitting merchant ships of the two Clans.  Meldryn considered the treasure stolen from his clan by the pirates and in turn stolen back by him as rightfully his both as loot and as his by way of being leader of his clan.  He then used his mining company as a front to market the goods and donated most of the funds to charities.  Part of Meldryns teaching by the Elders had instilled into Meldryn a total dedication to the bloodline and future of his clan..  Believing that wealth has weakened his clan making them soft he sought to take all luxuries from his people that they may have a hard life and be force to become a strong people once more.  Over two years Meldryn became quite wealthy while slowly selling of the wealth of his clan  it is even believed he pirated his own clans ships for during those two years a great number of the clan ships that were pirated the entire crews were released by the pirates who plundered them.
<P>
 At the conclusion of the two years the time in which the provisionary council should have had control over the two merged clans prior to Meldryn full control.  Meldryn returned by night to Nujel'm.  Many rumors and stories exist about that night of his return.  A fight and skirmish broke out about the time Meldryn was proclaiming himself rightful ruler over both clans and some how Meldryns father-in-law was killed and Meldryn blamed.  His wife became wounded by her own fathers poisoned dagger and because none were around who could save her she asked Meldryn to end her suffering for her and several guards of her father saw Meldryn deliver the mercy blow beheading her.  They did not know it was done in mercy and perceived it as an execution seeing both her and her fathers corpse at Meldryns feet.  Fierce fighting erupted and a great portion of the town was burnt to the ground that night.  Meldryns men were forced to flee by a combined force of soldiers from both clans as well as mercenary guards of the local town officials.
<P>
 Meldryn fled to the home of the lady Shayye whose house he had been using for some time now as both a hideout and place of storage while he posed as a businessman in the town of yew.  The next year was a long bloody civil war amongst the clan with Meldryn eventually taking total control over both combined clans.  Close to the end of the war Meldryn had a fight with his land lord the lady Shayye and they were married as a settlement of a dispute between them.
<P>
About this time the clan was beginning to accept Meldryn as the ruler over the clan.  An had playing upon Meldryn loyalty and duty to his clans bloodline required that Meldryn take more wives and have several children…  This they had done partly out of anger at Meldryn for his having married the elf Shayye and Shayyes wishes not to have any children.  This caused a permanent rift in the relationship between Meldryn and Shayye as Meldryn was town between Duty to his clan and a promise made to Shayye.  During this time several other ladies were selected by the council as mates to bear children for Meldryn and though Meldryn never took any unto his bed.  This persistence of the clan drove more wedges between Shayye and Meldryn that would never be removed.
<P>
Soon trouble returned in the form of Meldryn enemy Vestril.  Vestril had rebuild his power during this time of civil war amongst the Mawr Clan which was also a time of upheaval and separation amongst the Burning Heart over what sides to take in various Guild wars that were growing rampant about the lands far beyond the control of lord Brittish who in Meldryns eye had never been a Proper fair or just leader who had allowed corruption to run rampant across his land unreigned for many years.  At this precarious time Vestril struck at the Heart of Daylar with a false replica of Daylars first wife Charlana.  At the same time Sigma taken under a charmed necklace and Meldryn was bound by a clan oath made by his ancestors to grant a wish unto Vestril and thus Vestril took over the Tower of the Burning heart with Meldryns forces assisting in the Vestrils defense.  Alas though Malimn Raja and Primion and many others of the Burning heart broke through and reclaimed the tower this Broke Meldryn bond to assist Vestril and the false Charlana was slain and reverted back unto her true being.  With this Meldryns forces joined Daylars Burning Heart forces in a relentless pursuit of Vestril.  They tracked Vestril to the land known as Norrath and Daylar chose to gather a select number of the Burning Heart to travel to Norrath in pursuit of his father.  Meldryn bound by an Oath to Daylar was bound to join him in the passage.  Meldryns scouting of the lands of Norrath found a group of clans living in the town of Halas in Norrath with traditions very similar unto those of his clan.  Blood test were done and it was concluded that these clans were of the same lineage as Meldryns clan and thus Meldryn chose to uproot his clan and make an exodus to this new lands… for over the hundreds of years in which his clan had lived in Sosaria their blood line had become diluted and weakened by marriages to the lesser inhabitants of Sosaria.
<P> 
Meldryn as leader of his clan was tested by the leaders of Halas to win rights for his people to settle the region about Halas.  Meldryn as clan leader and ruler over his people was tried before the Tribunal of Norrath and found worthy to take the oath of a tribunal judge in the lands of Norrath.  Mean while though things were going well with Meldryn his clans rapid acceptance and integration into the new lands the Burning heart was struggling.  Its leader became afflicted with a feverish plague that spread amongst many member and even effected Meldryn.  Meldryn while fighting beside Svein Arella Cernus Syndie and others, was taken in a fever and passed out in the dessert.  While unconscious he was overcome with many wild feverish dreams about his then pregnant wife Shayye and their unborn child.  A paladin found Meldryn in the desert and used all his powers of healing to revive Meldryn to consciousness.  Meldryn however was still under the influence of the dreams and fearing for the lives of his wife and child ran all the way to Halas. When he arrived in Halas he was in such a feverish state that he was totally beyond reality and commenced to attack the guards of Halas who would have slew him fearing him to be a madman had not a young shaman lady intervened and rendered Meldryn unconscious.  For days the high shaman of Halas spent all their efforts keeping him alive but the disease in the form of a rash had covered him from head to toe and the shaman felt the only chance at survival for Meldryn was to kill the infection with fire.  They coated Meldryn in Oil and lit him as a human torch.  This almost killed Meldryn and permanently weakened him (ooc Meldryn lost 15 levels of Experience that night and one him a cover story about role-play in EQ vault and role-play recognition for the Burning Heart Guild)  Meldryn was tenderly nursed back to health my the daughters of the high Shaman of Halas and soon returned to Vale the Head quarters of BH about the time of the birth of his son Hindace.  Soon Daylar who in Meldryn eyes never truly recovered from the plague lost his heart and drive for success in settling the new lands and Turned the rule over to a council of three Mystiana Cernus and Meldryn with Cernus to be the leader of the three.  Meldryn desired to follow Daylar for it was to Daylar and Daylars quest that Meldryn was sworn to and not specifically to the BH as was most its members.  But Daylar personally requested that Meldryn remain, so Meldryn loyal to his oath took on the duties assigned by his liege Daylar. 
<P>
Problems soon came but not from the direction expected. Cernus was a clan leader of a fox clan, which had been blood enemies to Meldryns clan for centuries, but this was not the source of strife.  Cernus and others resented Meldryn because of Meldryns unconditional loyalty to his Oaths and because Meldryn was not sword into the BH under the same oaths as they had been.  And Cernus quickly established to Meldryn that He was the supreme decision maker in the BH and that Meldryns position mearly existed at his will.  This mattered little to Meldryn for Meldryn was not concerned with power and control as other were but in keeping the foundation of what Daylar had formed together for that was his commitment to Daylar or in this case in the absence of Daylar his founding dream that had formed the BH.  But Cernus continually turned a blind eye the problems at hand and would not head the cries of the guild.  Eventually the greater part of the guild left in sorrow as they watched what they had valiantly fought for crumble before them.  The sins of omission are always the greater sins.  The sin of neglect one of them Meldryn witnessed first hand.
Laim Javert  a prosecutor from the lands of Sosaria arrived one day and took sigma and Daylar as prisoners back to Sosaria to face false charges.  And despite a pardon from Lord British Laims false prosecution lead to great tragedy.  An old comrade of Meldryns appeared with information that Vestril may be behind the arrest of Daylar and sigma so Meldryn took Kishkuman and made haste back to the lands of Sosaria where they were ambushed and slain by Vestril and his men.  As Vestril left the scene of the battle leaving Meldryn o bleed to death the Goddess Amanda suspended Meldryn existence and took him into her plane and taught him of his lost soul.  Mean while in the woods of Sosaria near unto Yew Fireangel found Meldryns body and with a teardrop broke the suspension and she nurtured Meldryn back to health and returned him to the lands of Norrath where Shayye knowing of possible past feeling between Meldryn and Fireangel did not joyfully welcome Fireangel.  
<P>
Later Laim would again appeared in the lands of Norrath, by this time Tribunal authorities had heard of Lord Brittishes officials tampering in their realm of jurisdiction and had a warrant out for the apprehension of and foreign officials trying to illegally exert jurisdiction under their jurisdiction.  Meldryn detained Laim and brought him before the tribunal to which Laim requested rights of Judgeship over the lands of Norrath and was subsequently tested and found unworthy and sentenced accordingly.
<P>
 In the meantime Meldryns son Hindace grew and passed the trials of adulthood and took to wife the elf Xaria who Meldryn also put through a series of trials.  Meldryns time spent in council left his wife Shayye feeling neglected and she sought companionship in the arms of other men.  Meldryn heard reports of one then another but with faith in her neglected warnings of friends and one night he returned to find her in the bed of a trusted friend and Paladin whom Meldryn has asked to watch over her while he traveled on a journey.  Meldryn started to raise his sword against them in their sleep but instead removed his wedding ring and tied it to the sword he had given his friend to use to protect Shayye with signifying the end of the Marriage. 
<P> 
Shortly there after Meldryn proclaimed Hindace proxy chieftain of the clan.  With this decision made he began to set about lone journeys searching for something following what he called the bantan. As Hindace began to consolidate authority under him a Shaman a few years his senior came forth and Proclaimed himself the son of Meldryn by a 7th degree marriage between Meldryn and his half sister Ras Shamra his identity was confirmed and a few questions quickly calmed as law clearly stated that Hindace a son of a first degree marriage though younger in age was the legal heir.  And Maher Shala Shamra was embraced by Hindace as a brother and Maher took his rightful place in the council as the eldest male descendant of the Shamra family a position left vacant since the death of Ras's true father and her adoption by Celdryn.
Meldryn turned full leadership of the clan to his son Hindace who was also leading a rapidly growing guild know as the Final Covenant and went of then on a long search for his lost soul which he had been taught about by the Goddess Amanda.  On this journey he was greatly assisted by the young Warrior madden Guen, then the AGL of the UO chapter of the BH. Together they formed a close bond sharing in each others pains.  Meldryn made an offer to her which she refused but Meldryn regretfully mistook meanings.  Eventually Meldryns Quest lead him to the God of War and a pool of Blood.  The War god had long been banished from the lands of Norrath by the other god for having lead a huge army o giants ogres goblins and many other races including humans across the land.  He has long plotted his return and took Meldryn unto him with a great feast in which he got Meldryn drunk on a strange ale that does not effect the god and he tricked Meldryn into a terrible bargain in exchange for his soul.  Meldryn awoke drowning in a pool of blood but with youth restored, his soul and a torrent of emotions he had not felt since he was a small child when his soul had been torn from him. 
<P>
While still learning of his new soul and fresh youth he was faced with four women each seeking a commitment from him.  In the end he went with none of them and turned to his sword and a few small rival clan disputes.  In the heat of battle he soon began to gain some understanding of just how terrible of a price he had paid for his soul in his bargain with the War god.  What he began to learn frightened him and for the first time in his Life Meldryn feel fear.  The fear was not of anything or creature but of what terrible change or bond that had been formed inside him linking him to the god of war.  Meldryn turned to the plains of everfrost where he has always gone over the years to think through weighty matters.  From a lone secluded cave know of only  by a select few he has lived.  To this frozen cave high atop a mountain peek Teancum has faithfully provided Meldryn with reports of the worlds and changes taken place amongst them.  To this cave was delivered news of old comrades, Malimn Primion and Fireangel rebuilding the foundation of the dream Meldryn had sworn to protect so long ago.  Here he has meditated and sought a reason to go on for a meaning to his life.  Here he has heard Xaria come and sing songs of the clan and his son and the battle fought and won.  From this lone cave in the frozen peeks Meldryn has arisen Reborn in many ways yet the same in many ways and stepped forth again like a sleeper awakening. 
<P> 
Meldryn has not told me what his purpose is or what he has found from his search within his soul I know only that he has spent a large sum of money to have a spell researched for him to allow him to travel between several worlds and that he has sent forth several of Teancums scouts to these various worlds to prepare things of which I do not know save through a series of correspondence with leaders of the BH he has recommitted himself to their ranks and a series of letters have begun to flow between Meldryn and his sons  entourage the FC. 
<P> 
And so the life of Meldryn Mawr.  Heir to the Clan, Bound to a god of war, High Judge of the Tribunal,
