Inside her she felt that a visit to Ares was needed. Now for one who never worships the gods, this was a quite different. <br>
<br>
 After her training session had turned into a conference room about herself, she had followed Sartha in leaving. It wasn't that she was being cowardly, it was because she knew half of them were right. . right about her. What parts they were right about she would never tell them.<br>
<br>
 The assassin slid from the black mare's saddle, as she came upon the main temple of Ares. Walking along the horse, she gently patted it on its hind quarters, signalling it to go off on its own.  Then out of habit Dawn wrapped her hands around the two swords at her side, and began up the steps.<br>
<br>
 Upon reaching the door, she slipped inside. Waiting a moment for her eyes to adjust to the lightening contrast, and then proceeding forward to the altar. Quite surprised at the emptiness, so late at night.<br>
<br>
 She didn't kneel as she rounded the pillar to the altar. Instead she took a dagger, the blade going into her palm, and sliced the flesh. [Perhaps this would draw attention to the watching god.] Opening her now bleeding hand, she dropped the dagger with a clang onto the scarafice -table thing-, her blood dripping down around it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 279<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(8/14/01 10:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=137.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> As the blood</span><hr size=1>  As the blood dripped down from Dawn's flesh, her eyes took that crimson color for only a brief moment, and then back to the emerald color they knew best.
