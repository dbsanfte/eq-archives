     Doriana made her way back from the communal bathing area after a particularly long soak in a very hot bath.  She felt extremely relaxed and it showed in the slow way in which she walked back to her hut.  Not only was she relaxed but her mind was on more pleasant things and they all included a small blonde healer.  <br>
     It's said that when a warrior's mind is preoccupied that makes them the most vunrable and this time was no exception.  Before she even know what was happening a tarp was thrown over her head and then she felt ropeing around her upper torso, trapping her arms to her side, and another rope around her legs, keeping her from kicking out.  She struggled and even threw off a few people, but then others joined in effectivly trapping her and lifting her to carry her out of the village.  <br>
     Her first thoughts were to the village guards and how they allowed what seemed to be a small army in their home.  They would be drilling for days, if she had anything to say about it.  Her second thought was all the plesantness she would be missing out on this night.  <br>
     Her captors were carrying her for what seemed like a candlemark when they set her down roughly propped up next to a tree.  She could hear them breathing heavily and she mentally rolled her eyes.  It seemed fitting she would get kidnappers that were out of shape.  <br>
     After a short rest she was lifted again and they were on their way.  She listened to the sounds around her and from the way the mens feet landed on the earth she could tell it was more then likely rock, which meant they were headed up into the mountains.  Taking the more difficult way, where they.  Well not only were they out of shape, but they were morons too.  That only angered her more.  She was put out with herself for ever letting these hades be damned idiots get the drop on her.  <br>
     She tried to distinguish how many different men there were, she was sure of at least four, because she could make out at least that many distinctive voices whispering to each other.  She didn't know their language so therefore she wasn't able to pinpoint where they were from.  Thinking to herself, 'This is going to be fun, I have no idea what they are saying, so I have no idea what they want.'  No matter she was going to kick their sorry asses when they get to where they were going anyhow. <br>

<br>
Later that day, Chiara realized she hadn't seen the Princess all day.  While that wasn't unknown, it was pretty unusual.  Her first thought was that Dori was ill or injured, or perhaps just spending time with Zoe.  <br>
<br>
Dori wasn't at home, however, or in the healer's hut.  When she began to ask her sisters when they'd last seen seen the daughter of Aella, none could recall seeing her after she'd been to the bathing hut.  It wasn't until then she truly became concerned... <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">~*~  Chiara  ~*~</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

The air started to get colder and thinner.  The out of shape finally let Dori to her feet, tying her hands behind her back and made her walk the rest of the way.  She stumbled a bit, still having a tarp over her head, but eventually found her footing and moved along with them.  <br>
     <br>
     She was getting more and more tired and cold.  She certainly didn't leave the baths this morning wearing her warmest clothing.  What bother her more was the fact that she didn't know if these men had taken her to sell as a slave as so many of their Amazon sisters had been or if they knew her position in the tribe and we going to ransom her.  She was certainly not going to let that happen.  Hades with these men if they tried to put her tribe in some sort of danger.  <br>
     <br>
     The men continued to talk in their mother tongue quietly to each other.  After what seemed like another few candlemarks they stopped and she was tugged to a halt.  At this point it was pretty hard to feel her hands, they had gone numb some time ago.  She was jerked off to her side and stumbled over, landing her shoulder into a tree.  She was pushed down and tied securely to the tree.  She didn't know if they were at their destination or if this was a night stop.  <br>
 <br>
     Dori had stayed quiet throughout the whole ordeal, but she needed to move her hands or else she was concerned that it could do permanant damage.  She felt one of the  men kneel next to her to check her bindings.  &quot;Hey, can you at least untie me so I can move my hands.  And how about a little food.&quot;  It seemed it wasn't the smartest thing to do, since the man yelled at her in his language and then she felt the side of his boot connect with her temple.  There really wasn't much after that except darkness. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=queenchiara>Queen Chiara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#993300>(2/24/03 9:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm55.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/cslrwillow/images/chiarasig.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Your Worst Nightmare&quot;</span><hr size=1> Chiara found her sister queen, Rhiannon, and told her of her concerns.  <br>

Reserved since she was a child, Chiara rarely showed her emotions.  Dori, however, was closer to her than many sisters were to each other.

A young sister had been badly injured in a mock battle earlier that morning with some of the other students, and as such had required stitches and some tender care. The girl wasn't yet a warrior, but the teacher of the class had gotten a little sloppy and had allowed the children - who were all between six and nine summers old - to use longer staves than were specified for children that age. A few badly placed moves, a rock in just the wrong place - and the girl had gone down. Hard. She was carried to the healer's hut and Zoe had spent most of the morning soothing her, stitching up her wounds and keeping the mother well out of the way. It was a full time job, she mused - and now that she was the village's main healer, she loved every second of it. Especially since it meant a few stolen moments with the Princess. Audrey was gently helped to her feet, and the seven year old eased her way out of the healer's hut to find her mother outside. Brave girl she was. <br>
<br>
And speaking of the Princess, Zoe realized she hadn't been interrupted by her all morning. Interesting. And why had Chiara come in asking if she'd seen her? She'd been too busy, and besides - Dori likely had classes this morning and afternoon. Zoe really hadn't expected to see her until the evening meal. She sat down on a stool outside the healer's hut to adjust a sandal, and took off for the main hall to find Chiara - and see what in the world was going on. And where was that Princess of hers anyway? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=queenchiara>Queen Chiara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#993300>(2/25/03 4:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm55.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/cslrwillow/images/chiarasig.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Where's My Princess?</span><hr size=1> Chiara sighed.  &quot;I can talk to a few of our best trackers, but it'd be tough even for them to identify Dori's footprints.

Her heart sank when she picked up on Zoe's presence.  She'd planned to tell the young woman about the situation, but not that way.  &quot;It's entirely possible though they'll find something more toward the edges, Zoe.&quot;<br>

From a strictly practical perspective, as Zoe had said the skills of a healer might be needed.  Chiara also knew that Zoe was excellent with a staff, and the gods help anyone who'd harmed Doriana.  <br>

A young girl, nearly fifteen summers but with all the wisdom of the gods when it came to healing and caring for others. A girl that looked so much like Dori that sometimes she had to smile fondly and think back to when she and her Princess were this age. Not that it was really so very long ago - but sometimes, it certainly seemed like it.<br>
As luck would have it, Leilani was seated on the porch of her dormitory building, reading a scroll. Knowing she was destined for a healer's life, she often opted out of the mock battles that other girls her age staged with each other. She enjoyed their company well enough, but was so very quiet and gangly, still developing the hips and breasts that most of her age group had been working on for quite some time. Leila looked up as Zoe came scurrying towards her.<br>
&quot;Healer, is there something wrong?&quot; She'd never seen Zoe in such a hurry, unless there was a problem. &quot;Didn't I clean the healer's hut to your satisfaction?&quot;<br>
Zoe managed to give her the tiniest of smiles. The dark hair, the eyes ... gods. It was hard not to have a little bit of affection for the girl. Leila had come to them as a very young child, unaccompanied, with a homemade doll and a blanket, and the dress she was wearing. Her mother had been found three days later, killed by wandering idiots who were after the food she carried and the little bit of money she had. Leila was able to escape because no one was paying attention to her. Adopted by the tribe as a whole, everyone had taken some role in raising her, and Zoe was proud to see the young woman she was becoming.<br>
&quot;The Princess has been kidnapped. There's ... there's a chance we'll need a healer on this trip,&quot; Zoe quietly informed the girl. &quot;You have less than a quarter candlemark to get your things together and meet in the main square.&quot;<br>
&quot;The ... the Princess? Kidnapped? How, when?&quot; But Leila was already getting to her feet, shoving the door to her dorm open and grabbing a bag with a few items in it. &quot;And aren't you going?&quot;<br>
&quot;Of course I'm going,&quot; Zoe sighed as she stepped into the dorm after her young charge. &quot;But I'd like a second healer, and this is your chance to get out of the village for a while - tend to something other than cuts and scrapes. And make sure this is the life you really want.&quot;<br>
Leila gathered herself up. At nearly fifteen, she was already taller than Zoe, but she tried not to think of it. &quot;I'm willing to do what you ask of me, Healer.&quot;<br>
Zoe smiled again. &quot;Good. Meet in the main square. You will not need your staff for this mission. You will merely be along to accompany me and assist in any way that I need you.&quot; With that, the healer stepped out and raced across the square to her own hut, to gather her things and prepare to rescue the love of her life. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rhiannonmerai>Rhiannon Mer ai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 83<br> <font color=#993300>(2/27/03 8:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm55.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.absolutely.net/hannigan/ah26.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Orders</span><hr size=1> Rhiannon knew what she had to do.

Once the warriors set up the defenses, there wouldn't be much else for her to do.

A few pieces of dried fruit and a handful of dried figs; a fresh waterskin and a few containers of herbs (for medical purposes, of course); some bandages, and a change of clothes. Never know when you might need a clean skirt of a change of boots, after all. Zoe had been very specific - &quot;No weapons,&quot; she'd said. &quot;You won't need them on this mission. Leila sighed but reluctantly left her beloved staff behind. She was wickedly good with it, pretty darn fast with both short and long staves, but her first - her training staff - would always remain her favorite. Perhaps because it was with that staff that she made her intentions known as a small child: She would remain in the village, and become an amazon. She didn't want to go back to the tiny farm she'd grown up on, with the small hope of finding family there. She'd stay - stay with the Queens, the warriors - Zoe ... her friends. <br>
But enough sentiment. She hadn't time for that. The door to her building was carefully closed behind her and she raced for the village square, assembling there along with the warriors to go find the missing Princess.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=queenchiara>Queen Chiara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#993300>(4/4/03 4:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm55.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ready</span><hr size=1> A quarter candlemark later, the assignments had been distributed and Queen Chiara sat astride her mare Eclipse, weapons at the ready.

Her head still being covered she listened  as her kidnappers moved around the camp.  A few argued and then ended up in fist fights with each other.  Overall they seemed rather unorganized, but agressive.  It wouldn't be to her benefit to mouth off again.  So she kept quiet and tried to listen for anything that would help when her sisters came for her, which she was completely confident that they would.  She thought back to her survival training with Chiara and was grateful that she had been though it with an extremely tough trainer.  It helped in this sort of situation.  <br>
     Just then she heard one of her captors walk up to her and said something in his language.

Leila was exhausted, and had napped off and on while riding Zoe's horse. Zoe had chosen to walk through most of the night, tight lipped and speaking to no one, with the exception of quietly murmured conversations between herself and Leila. Zoe felt horrible for allowing her Princess, her lover and partner in life to be kidnapped in such a bold and sloppy attack. What could they possibly hope to gain by capturing an Amazon? And a Princess of the nation, at that! Must be a bunch of stupid men hoping to gain a new and well toned slave. She sighed, taking the reins of her horse, who for the moment was still nameless while she got to know his personality. Hopefully, they'd catch up with the group soon. The group who held her beloved captive. <br>
Leila was wrapped up in layers of furs. Not all of them were hers though, of course; she was also in charge of carrying furs and a bag of clothes to dress the Princess in once they rescued her. She stirred atop Zoe's chestnut colored horse, catching ahold of his neck as she slowly sat up. The sun was barely making an appearance above the trees. She had anticipated making camp for the night, but it had been decided by the Queen and other warriors that they should press on, rescue their Princess and kick some wandering idiot ass. The young girl glanced down to her mentor, and sighed. This was entirely too difficult for Zoe to handle, and Leila prayed to the goddess that when the time came, she'd be able to handle her own and help as needed.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=queenchiara>Queen Chiara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#993300>(4/5/03 4:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm55.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/cslrwillow/images/chiarasig.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Next Morning</span><hr size=1> Chiara, with a few of the warriors, was scouting ahead.

The queen signalled the youngest of the warriors to return back to the main group to tell them the news as soon as she was sure of the location.  <br>
