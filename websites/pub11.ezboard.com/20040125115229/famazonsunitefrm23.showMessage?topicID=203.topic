His upbringing followed by the lack of control he sometimes got on his emotions didn't make him a very stable god to be around.<br>
<br>
Walking to the centre of his temple there was table which had scattered maps and plans all over it. He picked up one in particular...a map of Athens.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, sorry sis. I never really liked your city anyway&quot; He yelled out to one of his servants to blow the horn to give a signal to a nearby army of his to come to his temple...<br>
<br>
****two days later****<br>
The army arrived and the general was standing besides Ares to receive instructions.<br>
<br>
&quot;So Lucate, its quite simple just destroy the city and do whatever you want...but if you meet any Amazons on the way don't do ANYTHING...unless you want my wrath&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes sir&quot;<br>
With that Lucate walked out the room.<br>
<br>
Ares sensed some-one in another of his temples, so he dissappeared there. There was a sacrifice of a young woman going on there at his altar<br>
<br>
&quot;Please...I didn't do it&quot;<br>
<br>
The god appeared in front of her and looked down at the girl she had blonde hair and green eyes....like Dawn. With a quick movement he freed the girl and pushed her out the door. The soldiers stood in shock...the head of the band walked upto Ares<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you think your doing&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You dare question a god!&quot;<br>
<br>
He slit the mans throat of the altar and proceded to burn the rest of them with fireballs. When that was done he walked outside the temple and shot strong poer bolts at it cuasing the temple to disintergrate to the ground<br>
<br>
&quot;Thats what I think of your sacrifice&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uvvvthegoddesshecatevvv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VVV The Goddess Hecate VVV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(11/27/01 12:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=203.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> curiosity</span><hr size=1> appearing a few feet behind Ares .·:*¨¨*:·.Hecate .·:*¨¨*:·.stood still wearing a large hooded robe which revealed all of her features except her pierceing silver menacing eyes.<br>

He looked like an angel, glowing softy with his sun-like aura, the noon sun itself still high in the sky. He rolled over, mumbling something to himself. He rolled dangerously close to the edge of the sofa, but managed not to fall off. He wipped his face and snorted a bit. The past week had been hectic.<br>
<br>
From the skies above Olympus flew two of Apollo's crows, the white Corniocopia, and the grey Prometheus. The landed on Apollo squaking loudly. Apollo shot up like a rocket, and fell off of the couch with a thud. He opened his eyes, the world was spinning. He tapped his head a bit, everything returning to normal. He looked with narrowed eyes to the crows.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oooh, this had better be good!&quot; he murmered. The crows, his companions, along with mice, and wolfs, were scattered through out the earth to collect its secerets and report back to him. And obviously Corniocopia and Prometheus had found out something worth while. He placed his hand in his chin, resting it there, his legs folding into the ever famous &quot;indian style&quot;. He raised his brows.<br>
<br>
&quot;SO!?!? What is it?&quot; Apollo snapped. Corniocopia started to babble and squak along with Prometheus. Apollo's face lightened up, and a gasp escaped him. Oh boy, was it worth it! Apollo flashed with light, and when it cleared he was in a black tunic with a golden roped belt. His sandels and laurel crown were gold, along with his wristlets. His knee-length cape was black, with a gold underside. And he was off.<br>
<br>
Apollo flew from Olympus with powerful intension, there was no way he was going to let Ares, that uncultivated black sheep even get near Athens. He loved the people of Athens as if they were his own, and was not about to let the army of Ares sack it. He appeared above Ares a bit, noticing some others had assembled themselves, among them being Hecate. He payed no mind to them.<br>
<br>
&quot;ARES,Lord of War, activities, and preparations of battle. How dare you even attempt to sack Athens, the highlight of Greece? For not only is it the apple of the Greecian eye, it is the patron city of our beloved sister Athena. It is by no fault of her's and leastly the fault of the people of Athens, that Dawnithinia died. If you want to point fingers, blame Thanatos, black lord of death and dying. I, Apollo...&quot; a hand was placed on his chest at this point.<br>
<br>
&quot;second to that of ONLY my father, will not allow you to put this city to ruin. For together I, and Athena will alone topple you and your army if such must come to pass. For we alone are the strongest after Zeus himself.  Oh and thats another thing.&quot; he pointed to Ares in a demeaning fashion.<br>
<br>
&quot;Zeus himself will be OUTRAGED at you for destroying the city of his most favorite of offspring. Not only will you destroy the center of education and enlightenment for the Greeks themselves, but you would destroy the Pantheon!!! Ooo, and then EVERYONE would hate you, more than they do now.&quot; by now Apollo was on the ground, right up in the face of Ares with his &quot;golden boy&quot; attitude. He shot a look to Eris as if to tell her to shut up before she even started. He was in no mood to hear her mouth.<br>
<br>
&quot;So Ares, just take you &quot;army&quot; and go calm down in Sparta or something. Somewhere where they will give a crap...excuse my kione...about what you think, and how you feel.&quot; Apollo rolled his eyes to his older, yet...smaller...brother. <p>      *~*The Golden God*~*

Though neither ever gave her worship, they were a chosen of their kind. And Athena loved the amazons as though they were her own children, her own sisters.<br>
<br>
She sat in her throne until she heard sounds comming from outside the city gates. She stood up and vanished appearing near the entrance seeing Ares army marching towards Athens.<br>
<br>
&quot;To Tartarus with you Ares.&quot;<br>
<br>
She growled lowly. First she had to deal with Aphrodite and Paris, and now this? She waved her hands and closed her eyes as a golden iron weave was created around her precious city. It would not hold forever, but it might give her time.<br>
<br>
<br>
She vanished once more and made her way to where Ares and the others were, but not before making a small stop.<br>
<br>
She appeared standing in front of Ares with her hands on her hips.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come now Ares, did you really think I'd let you?&quot;<br>
<br>
She knew he was hurting, she could feel it. They all had suffered a loss as far as she was concerned. Ignoring the others rude remarks and incoherant threats towards Ares, she leaned in towards her brother.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is not the way to get over this Ares and you know it. Athens is home to many amazons. I give them refuge and rest there from their journeys. Amazons from her tribe.&quot;<br>
<br>
She sighed lightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have something for you. Perhaps you may see what you should be doing in her honor instead of war against me.&quot;<br>
