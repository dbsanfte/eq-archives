The Black Sea Tavern was what she could make of it from the sign,in her own opinion the sign could use a new paint job,it was hardly readable. With a simple shrugg of her shoulders,she made her way to the tavern.<br>
<br>
Clad in a dark green halter and black leather form fitting pants and a dark cloak,she swung the tavern door open and strode right in,closing that door behind her. Untieing her cloak,she then swung it off her shoulders and hung it on a hook near the door. Light booted footsteps lead her to the bar where she sat down on a stool and ordered mug of warm cider.<br>
<br>
While she waited for her drink,she straightened out her right wrist bracer,then reaching down into the pouch on her hip she pulled out a coin to pay for the drink. Paying for a drink! That was something she didn't often do,but none the less,she sets the coin on the bartop for the keep.<br>
<br>
Once the drink was handed to her,she took a sip before setting the mug down on the bartop,then turned around on the stool to gaze upon the other patrons in the tavern. She smiled lightly as she looked around,always enjoying being among the people. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uautumndeluxe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Autumn Deluxe</A> at: 1/19/02 7:13:27 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ukayceryder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kayce Ryder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#939393>(1/19/02 11:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/cristalc15/images/js1s.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Where the road leads ya</span><hr size=1> Kayce roared up to the tavern on her motorcycle (I know, I know, just deal with it) and screeched to a stop outside the front door.

<br>
Looking around, she saw a half naked woman sitting at the bar, and she walked right over to her and paid for her drink.<br>
<br>
"You ought to put more clothes on that body of yours, woman. It's winter out here, if you hadn't noticed..."<br>

She took off her leather jacket and offered it to Autumn.<br>

She sighs before taking another drink of her cider. Very disappointed in the Goddess Artemis,had heard alot of great things about her and many other gods.

He looked around, and smiled that triangle-shaped smile only he can do so well. "Heh, cool, there's hot chicks in he-are." He tried his best to look sophisticated, and waddled over to the bar, and climbed his fat lil butt up onto one of the barstools. It took him ten minutes, but he finally scaled the thing and was sitting on top of it with his fat lil feet sticking out in front of him. "Eh, hey, can I get a beer?" he asked the tender, disguising his voice as an older man. <br>
<br>
"No," the tender said.<br>
<br>
"Excuse meh?" Cartman said indignantly.<br>
<br>
"No, you're a child, you cannot have a beer," the tender repeated.<br>
<br>
"Oh, well, yeh, fine. I'll just go on over and sit over there... with the ladies over there... and get a bit of beer over there..." <br>
