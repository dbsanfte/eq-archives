impressive. * Sighs* Tho,Considering they are rare..I dont advise you kill it yet...I dont want another Centaur war on our hands, especially with Hippolyte gone. Perhaps we should wait to see what she has to say for herself and figure why she is in our village before you do anything that will cause us to be at war once more with those filthy beasts.<br>

<br>
* Stops and thinks of what she had just said, Maybe it was true what Hipp said, maybe she was growing more and more like the Queen with each passing day. DeL was always one for kill first, then question later when she was younger. Hipp was right...Yikes...DeL was maturing....*<br>

 &quot;Call me a child again and I'll walk out on this tribe. I am not one, and I know Hippolyte wouldn't be happy, if when she returned her High Council Cheiftess was gone, because you couldn't treat me by my age. And if you don't like my attitude, deal with it.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn slammed another kick into the girl and dropped off the podium. Hippolyte was right, no one in this tribe understood her, or her kind.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Do what you want with the tresspasser. I'm not helping with it anymore.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dissappearing between huts before Del had a chance to speak up. It was one thing to deny Dawn a right to kill, but to call her a child as well.. was more than any insult. <p>

From what she could detect, she was still in one piece. DeL then ordered a guard to fetch a waterbucket and rag. When the guard returned,she washed the dried blood from the girls face. Her wounds werent as bad as they looked. DeL untied the girls hands and feet and quickly walked out of the cell, she shut it and locked it, checking the lock. She then turned to the Guard.*<br>

 She had been told to make amends with Del, that it would be good for Del to have the High Council Cheiftess on her side, while Hippolyte was away. And in NO WAY would Dawn give her such special treatment, and the ability to disrespect her.<br>
<br>
 No, Del had crossed the line, and wouldn't be able to cross back over. Dawn had given to much to the Amazon Nation, and to Themiscrya to be called a child. And in the circumstances Dawn wasn't a child, she was an immortal being. An old immortal being, and as far as the assassin was concerned, Del better ram that through her head.<br>
<br>
 Growling lightly, Dawn slammed a foot into a punching bag that hung in a tree nearby. Dawn frequented this place, in her times of anger. When she couldn't take it out on those that angered her.<br>
<br>
 Dawn shook her head, as she brought her foot back down, immediatly pulling her form into a fighting stance. <br>
<br>
 People were wrong on another impulse, Dawn and Del were completely different. No one knew Dawn's story, it was her mystery, they didn't know what she had, and was going through. Another comparison, would cause even more anger. <p>

This was not her fight, nor would she make it hers unless she felt it right to do so. This was not the case. She would only support her closest Athelfi.

Sending one last punch that ended with those tiger claws extended, and when she drew back the sand ran full force out of the bag, forming a pile in the green grass.<br>
<br>
 Dawn raised twin brows to look at Sartha, and with a shrug, Dawn slid those claws back in and sliced the bag into pieces. Atleast there was a bit more punching left when the thing got a hole. <p>

Again, I express my apologies...You do not know how bad I feel about all this Vivian. Please, be rested assured that noone else in this tribe would disrespect another initiate just because of there race. We are all made up of different races here in Themsicrya. The Amazons here try to find a family bond that i have not seen in other tribes, with some exceptions of course, as you have seen. This tribe has been my family from the get go. I founded this tribe long ago with Hippolyte when the Amazon Nation was still small, and groups of rouge Amazons were running about giving us a bad name. Hippolyte is like the mother I never had. *smiles* Now only one or two give us bad names. Usually the ones with huge egos. * Shrugs* but they bother me not. Ive learned o live with people such as that. You too will one day. It takes patience, lots and lots of patience. You either ignore the small minded folks, or deal with them. They never change no matter how old they are, or how long they have lived. * chuckles* Alot of the Olympian Gods do come around here alot, as you will see. Bewary of some of ther ego's as well...<br>
