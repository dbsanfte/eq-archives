<br>
She had a dream.. about herself. She saw all the things she'd done. All the pain she'd caused others in the past. All the preaching she'd done about living in peace, while she didn't hesitate to raise her staff in battle.<br>
<br>
She remembered Hope. Such an innocent child. She could have grown up to be a good person if she could have just stood up to Xena. <br>
<br>
She remembered Crassus. He didn't have to die. She could have saved him, left him in prison and sent a different man who deserved to die under a true identity in his place.<br>
<br>
&quot;I've been living my life in nothing but lies.&quot; She said as she began to weep.<br>
<br>
She ran out of her hut and to a nearby lake. She dropped to her knees and stared into her reflection for a moment. <br>
<br>
She saw how innocent she had once been, before she left Poteidaia. Then she saw who was now. Which scared her, because she wasn't sure what or who she was anymore. Then she saw what she could become... she saw Callisto with the same insane glare she had before she killed Perdicus.<br>
<br>
She bit her lip, struggling not the cry as she curled up on the wet grass... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=queenalysia>Queen Alysia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#8A2BE2>(11/24/00 4:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> She came upon Gabby</span><hr size=1> Alysia rode through the lands hearing that Gabrielle was in Sarmatia.

That took her to the lake. She saw Gabrielle crying on the wet grass and tears came to her eyes. Aly did not know what had made Gabrielle so upset, nor did she want to tell Gabrielle why she herself was in tears that night. Alysia had been through a long few days from her journey through Poteidaia and she did not want to do nothing but be there for Gabrielle.<br>
