She of course planned to return, but some thing needed to be taken care of back home.<br>
<br>
She decided to give her mare a break, and Aly walked home by herself the night before. She had time to try and think of what was to happen with her, with her life. But nothing came.<br>
<br>
She went quietly past the huts where her athelfi slept, passing her own hut out by the Ancient Caves of the Scynthian tribe. She fell to her knees near the stream and took a handful of water to her mouth.<br>
After her thirst had been delt with, she looked back towards the caves.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ancients, I am confused. I know not where my place is. I have sought to find a common ground between the Elisians and my Amazon Ways.&quot;<br>
<br>
She sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why have I let myself become weakened to my enemies? I would understand if I was merely embracing the Elisian ways, but that's not it. The Elisians admire their non-violent ways, but it's not that way for me. I need my warrior ways. . . .please Ancients. . . if you cannot help me in my times of trials, send someone who can.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Queen</span><br>  Posts: 141<br> <font color=#993300>(6/25/01 1:40:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Quest for a Common Ground</span><hr size=1>  Dawn had been sleeping in her hut, so late at night. She was off in that time, in between the concious mind, and the unconcious, when she had recieved a dream that was to real to be just a dream. The preminition had caused the Amazon Assassin to scramble out of bed, pull on her leathers, boots, and those weapons, and set out. Emeralds were hazy as she wondered through the forest, searching out the preminition in her head. <br>
<br>
 The gift of preminitions was something Dawn too seriously, and never knew when it was right or wrong. But this one.. this one had told her to go to the ancients cave. <br>
<br>
 There the Amazon..long time warrior and assassin stood. Arms pulled around her stomach as she began to finally wake up, the Scynthian wheather was to her liking, when she was fully awake. And in that groggy tone, she spoke.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Warrior skills? Ah I think I got those.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn smiled to her sister. It was an automatic..yes the ancients sent her... who else could come to the rescue..but one of the best... <p>Pyschotic injustice

She let out a painful sigh. One that didn't come from the body, but from the heart and soul. As she brushed a single strand of her blonde hair from her face, her eyes gazed at Dawn, wondering. . .what the Ancients had instore for this night.<br>

<br>
&quot;Then let us go and find out.&quot;<br>
<br>
She walked to the opening of the caves, closed her eyes and began to mumble words that sounded Scynthian, but were much older. They were the Shamaness words of the Tretmolec, and only Aly knew them at that moment.<br>

An invisable fire errpted from the opening of the caves, and became visable to them. Alysia placed her hand against the stone and the fire vanished allowing them a safe passage into the sacred places of the Ancients.<br>

<br>
 &quot;I'm here incase you get into a deep trance or some of the events cause trama, and you need to be pulled out. If you call for me, I'll get you out of the trance.&quot;<br>

 Dawn knew that Alysia had to go through with this, and she probably wouldn't ask to be pulled out, but she offered it anyways.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Lay down and visualize this scenario. Picture a huge, detailed library..like something from Rome or Greece. Infront are 10 giant steps to the door, walk up them very slowly. You can count the steps if you think it will help you. When you get to the door at the top of the steps, there is a huge knocker. Knock. The person/creature/animal that answers is your spirit guide. Tell the thing that opens the door, what part of your life you would like to go back to, or if you'd just like to see a general bit. Picture a door behind your guide, have him/her take you to the door. They will open the door, and sit you down. In this room, you can take down a book, a scroll, picture book, and read. Speak aloud what you see, when you are done, put what it is you have away, go back out the door, thank your guide, and count your way back down the steps.&quot;<br>

 Dawn worked at recording the information she was getting from her LaTra, but every moment her eyes were getting heavier. This wasn't the time for Dawn to need a cat nap. She shook her head and kept writing.<br>
<br>
 Then all was black, Dawn's body lay sprawled out next to Alysia's. <br>
<br>
 When Dawn blinked, and looked around, the demonic tiger was at the side of the Samsara, and all she could do was blink.. oh how this was the work of the ancients. <p>Pyschotic injustice
Mommy made me this way
Evil and hungry
I'm just a craving soul
Craving for your blood and death; M'Dear
Don't worry it won't hurt..
Just a dagger or two.. 
Crimson spilling onto my hands..
Running over the flesh to drip from my elbow
Scarring the black leather pants..
Mmmm its yummy
Don't worry I only strike once...
Don't bother to scream... they won't catch me

She was watching something with wide eyes as her vision became more clear.<br>
<br>
&quot;By the Gods. .&quot; She mumbled.<br>
<br>
A war was being waged, and Samsara was apart of it. She looked down at her hands and there was a dagger in it. With a wooden hilt and a blade made out of albino. This was the ancient legend Atmah Dagger.<br>
<br>
As she looked off into the distance, she saw the Tretmolec tribe. The men, being slaughtered by the Cannibals.<br>
<br>
&quot;No!&quot;<br>

 ~Aly? Is that you?~<br>
<br>
Years ago, all Dawn was, was a tiger. A demonic tiger, she lived in that form. At this time she hadn't been much of an Amazon sister, or would have helped with the war. Now she was there. <p>Pyschotic injustice

&quot;Nai Dawn, it is me. . &quot;<br>
<br>
But something was different. . .she was Alysia of course. But she was also Samsara. And she was watching the men of her tribe get slaughtered.<br>
<br>
&quot;No!&quot; She screamed again as she caught sight of the bloodshed.<br>
<br>
She began running towards the battle, faster than she had ever run in her life. Something was wrong inside her, something was going to happen. . .something bad.<br>
<br>
It was then that it happened. She saw one of the Cannibals cut her brother's throat. He was all she had left, their father and mother had been murdered years ago by the same cannibal tribe. Samsara had enough.<br>
