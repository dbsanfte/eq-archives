Some of the old huts had been torn down, along with the Queen's hut and were replaced with bigger ones than the smaller ones. The gate was redone, placed on the lock of the gate was Paphos crest. A stable for horses had been built, along with a place for weapons and a storage house for food and wine. The Queen Hut was located in the very back of the Village, the Loire Insignia on the medallion almost every Loire had was on the Hut's door.<br>
<br>
There were a few more wolves than there was before, Arixa and Lupe now being the head of the fairly large pack.<br>
<br>
Odessa had sent word to XVH and other places for Celebration of Paphos, hopefully Xenira and Cyane would show up, after all...Dess had decided to make Xenira the Second Queen, though Xen didn't know about her decisions.<br>
<br>
She had her guards positioned at the front gate, willing to let all Amazons and certain males into the festivities. <p><center> <link> </center.>

Tresses of red reached pasdt her shoulders, pools of hunter green scan her surroundings. Gaia was wrapped in a  burgandy gown with sparkling green outlining, printed and sewn on her gown were a design of Gaelic and Greek descent. A group of vines, twigs and fresh green leaves were intertwined into a crown which wrapped around her head and came to a point between her eyes.<br>

Bare feet paded to the Queen's Hut and a pale hand reached out knocking on the door. A Smile threatened her features as she traced the Loire symbol with her finger.

&quot;Mother Gaia, w-what a suprise!&quot;<br>
<br>
She bowed her head in respect to her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Have you come to join in the celebration of Paphos?&quot;<br>

That was a stupid question, but Dess didn't know if she was here on business or for the celebration. <p><center> <link> </center.>

Zel smiled and saluted the gaurds as she came up to the gates of Paphos. Once she was let passage into the tribe,she walked around to find Odessa.<br>
<br>
She saw some peeps at Odessa's hut and decided thats where she needed to go. So she went there. She offers a smile to Gaia and Thalassa. &quot;Hiya...&quot; She then looks at Odessa,not knowing her personally or anything,but just knew this was the queen,yeah. She extends a hand to Odessa in greeting.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi,Queen Odessa. I'm Zelia,Queen Varia's right of caste from Chadesia. I saw the invite you sent to Chadesia,so I thought I'd stop by and say,congrats with everything and all,and hopefully send my congrats to anyone else who needs it.&quot; She smiled. This was another attempt of Zel's to make friendly terms with another amazon queen and other amazons,since she was an important instrument to Chadesia and all,not just because she is Varia's wife,but also now because she was going to be the one who brings the new Chadesia princess into the world.

<br>
She was surprised to see others still arriving however, but pleased as well that her own lateness wouldn't be so noticeable. <br>
<br>
She left her horse with the girl working in the stables that day, after brushing her down and making sure she was fed. <br>
<br>
She walked out to what appeared to be the center of the village, looking for the festivities. <p><center> <img src = "http://user.netomia.com/angelkim/rhia.png"><br>

She knew Rhiannon from the Caucaus Mtn. Tribe, and Xenira was a dear friend of hers and Belle's, but she wasn't an Amazon...not yet. <p><center> <link> </center.>

<br>
&quot;Yasoo, DeLerium.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked around, it was a good crowd, but she wondered if Julian was going to show up or not...or maybe even mother. She stepped up to the platform, looking to the good gathering she had.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yasoo Athelfi and Goddesses. Today, we celebrate the rebirth of Paphos! With the rebirth of this Amazon City, I hope to encourage all Amazons of different belief to come under one tribe, as here in Paphos. Some of you may know that I'm of the Loire bloodline, meaning I am a Scynthian. The reason why I have chosen Greek lands to settle a tribe is to bring the ways to the Atmah here in Greece, to give some insight and understanding, as well to me to understand the ways of Artemis. I'm not asking anyone to choose, you're welcome to worship any deity of your choice, but I ask that there be reverence held for both Gaia, The Atmah, Artemis, The Ancients, Hera, Athena, and so on...&quot;<br>
<br>
She motioned toward Xenira to come up to the stage.<br>
<br>
&quot;As Queen, I'm going to appoint a Second Queen and a Princess. Though, I'm still searching for a Princess, I have already chosen a Queen. Though, she is not an Amazon, her initiation into the Amazon Nation will be a great one. By right, she is an Amazon, considered that her mother, Eve, was given Gabrielle's Rite of Caste as Amazon, making her a Princess. Xenira's initiation into the Amazons will be something to be looked forward to, as the blood of Xena is finally welcomed into the Sisterhood.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled, and hugged Xenira when she reached the platform.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're initiation will take place in Northern lands, and I'm sure Grandmother and the others will be happy to help...&quot; <p><center> <link> </center.>
