<br>
         There was a fork in the road. That led not to two villages, but to three. To one side it would take you to the Northern Lands, to the other it would take you to Themiscrya and the last would take you to Orio-Pata. A road commonly travelled by an Amazon, a Jack of all trades. Dawnithinia was a Queen, a Chieftess, and a Queen's right of caste. Three things that had always ment the world to her, in her place in the Amazon Nation. The Nation hadn't been her whole life, but it had been a majority, a majority she'd given her soul and heart, to.<br>
<br>
         This morning, atop the large flat rock, that marked the three splits in the road, the rising sun shown on a new day.. a new world to come. The Amazon Queen of Orio-Pata, lay lifeless across the rock. The young woman's eyes had last opened the night before, and closed, in the same emerald color that others had seen. After 256 years, the immortal woman had accepted her fate, and the right time for her death, and departure.<br>
<br>
         There was nothing special to Dawn's death. No murder or assassination, it had not been done in the spirit of war, or the spirit of love. Infact many would proclaim it selfish and egotistical. But it was done, and the rituals that followed it, were done. Dawn was with Sartha, always and forever. The immortal had accepted the time, and the rightness of her death, and it had happened. No sacrafice or goodbyes. It would all be missed, of course.<br>
<br>
         Her soul after the rituals, had been trapped inside a heart shaped, crystal. Atleast in half of it. That half, was now in a bag, on its way to Scynthia, by order of Dawn,and by travel of a black demonic tiger. Many other black demonic tigers were on their way to Themiscrya, temples, and villages in the Amazon Nation, to do their last orders by their Queen.<br>
<br>
         Dawn's lifeless body, lay as if she were just sleeping. The assassin looked as though she was just heading home, home to Orio-Pata to change from the war. Her hand was still matted in blood from the fight with Fogstone, her war mask sat atop her head, and the weapons she entered the battle field, were placed exactly back on her body.<br>
<br>
         A few feet away, the stallion from Orio-Pata stood grazing. Everything seemed normal. But no one had been there the night before, with Sartha and Dawn. Then, not even then, had they said their goodbyes. They would always be together, this prooved their bond as athelfi.<br>
<br>
         It had been unexpected, and was now forever finished. When the time deemed right, perhaps she would return, by some secret the two amazons shared. Life had taken Dawn far, and brought her many things. But never once had she regretted the moments Sartha and her shared, and there would be many more. Stupidity had not come from this death, but a bond, one that would last more than a life time. <br>
<br>
         The Amazon Nation had not lost, and perhaps not gained. But the wisdom that Dawn would carry on, from here, had been brought from this nation and her time she spent with it. Perhaps now really hadn't been the time to go, and maybe it truely had been selfish, but she was gone now, and would miss it forever. She'd miss the times she spent with everyone, even the time she spent with hate. <br>
<br>
         Dawnithinia Rivent Darkshade had lived a life among man, and then among woman. Always knowing her spot with them and many others, her destiny had not been a secret to her, but one to others. Never had she found the love in her friends had she ever found in herself.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sartha>Sartha</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 238<br> <font color=#939393>(11/25/01 9:11:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Sartha Follows</span><hr size=1> ::as always, Sartha was there alongside Dawn. She had vowed long ago with her Athelfi that they would not be without each other. They were bond sisters, meant to roam together in both life and death. And so they would....::<br>
<br>
::Those silvery-golden eyes were closed and her soul, as Dawn's, was trapped within one of two pieces of a split locket. Her own piece was locked around Veyriean's neck, on it's way to her home, to Themiscrya. She would no longer sing, play that runic flute, smirk, laugh... She would no longer be, yet she was there, always::<br>
<br>
::Laying beside her Athelfi, a true smile graced those pale lips, her wounded side untended since the war had ended only days before. She had lived a life filled with regret for a past she could not mend, and pain for a legacy she was condemned for. Yet she died with a smile, her first true smile in so many decades, so many centuries. Her age had never been determined, or told of, but she was older than any deserved to be living on the soils of earth. But she was happy in death. Perhaps now her soul could rest and, in time, she could start anew in another place::<br>
<br>
::The small silver flute, adorned with runes, lay in her open palm, her runic sword strapped across her still back. Those runes would glow no more, and, once touched by other hands, would wash away until a day would come when she might hold it again, as something, someone else. That sword was forever hers::<br>
<br>
::And so Sartha Anne Rose lay in her final rest, death's kind hand leading her on into something she had needed for all too long: A new beginning::  <p>~The old days are gone. You can't live in the past, and you can't wait for the future. Now is all we have. You do the other two, you waste your life...
Sartha Anne Rose... Amazon for all time~</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#939393>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#939393> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm19>Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata</a> <font color=#939393> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#939393> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
