The stench was ghastly, as years of abominable and grotesque offerings had been thrown into its depths.<br>
<br>
The watcher is cloaked in red, with black runic designs interwoven in the fabric.  Nothing discernable about this creature could be seen, for it was a master in secrecy and mystique.<br>
<br>
The eerie grey illumination that emanated from the water cast the room in a paleish sheen.  The room stank from the fetid pool, and there were no windows for the stench to dissipate from.  In fact, no doors could be seen either.<br>
<br>
Hissing loudly, the figure was upset at what it had just seen from the scrying pool.  It had launched an attack in Waygarth, hoping to eliminate the heroes in one easy strike.  But by blasted fortune on the warriors part, they had escaped.<br>
<br>
It waved a gloved hand before the pool, and the image immediately switched.  It showed a dense forest, overgrown and dark.  Lights could be seen within, bobbing within the darkness.  The pool didn't convey sound, not because it couldn't, but because the scryer had not wished it to.<br>
<br>
The image magnified, and creatures of unknown origins were furiously digging.  The pit was already quite deep, but those who had wings flew in and out, the others simply lept.  What they were looking for, they hadn't found yet.<br>
<br>
Cursing at their slowness, but knowing that it could not be helped, the watcher gestured again.  This time, the image was that of a temple.  It was situated somewhere very hot and sandy.  It seemed as if it was a forgotten temple, for no signs of anything living could be seen.  But that was what the watcher wanted, to avoid detection, especially at this point, was very important.  The pool changed color, a sickly yellow, and now the image showed that temple was indeed occupied.  Swarms of ghasts, waves of spectres floated in and out of the temple.  They seemd to have a purpose in mind, as if they were preparing for something.  Nodding to itself, the spectre again gestured to the pool.<br>
<br>
The pool became a swirling haze of darkness, nothing discernable could be seen.  The figure spoke, with a voiced muffled, so that even this could not give away its identity.<br>
::Everything is progessing as planned Lord.<br>
<br>
Getting no response, but knowing that his message had been received.  It gestured once again, dissipating this time, the fluid within the pool.  Confirming that the pool was indeed closed, for it surely didn't want anything unpleasant coming through and paying an unexpected visit.  The figure stepped within the now dry pit.  <br>
<br>
Floating gently over the hole, it stretched both arms above its head, and suddenly disappeared.<br>

He shook the hair from his eyes looking to them a sign of urgency on his face. His eyes looked especially disturbed when he looked to Hermes, for which he knew would not have the power to over come what had just arisen from the depths of darkness. For the thing, the pent up evil. The darkness, would grow more powerful than Zeus himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hermes we need to talk.&quot; Apollo says,  grasping his arm pulling him from Dionysus.<br>
<br>
&quot;Listen, mon frére... and listen good, for I am afraid to tell this tale more than once.&quot; he paused, closing his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;I had a preminition. I was in Egypt and I traveled all the way back to tell you. I knew something was wrong, I could feel it in my bones. All I knew is that something was awry in the north. Where in the north, I did not know. What it was, that neither did I know. I chalked it up to being a large mortal squabble. But it was not. For brother I saw our dismal future. I saw the fall of the Olympians themselves if we do not act soon, if we do not apply immediate action. And no dear brother, no half baked schemes from mortal heroes. We need a well planned out plan of attack, for this evil ::he paused before giving the energy a name:: is greater than Father Zeus. Or atleast it will grow to be in the soon future. The thing...::he pauses again, regaining his haggard composure:: it feeds of the negative energies. All the negative thoughts we expell, all the negative acts, it grows stronger.&quot;<br>
<br>
He placed his hand on his brothers shoulder, his look of pure dread seemingly to seep into the eye's of Hermes. <br>
<br>
&quot;I fear that if something is not done soon, we will have a problem on our hands to great to do something about.&quot; <br>
<br>
He let go of Hermes and looked to the sky. Mother Earth herself, Gaia seemed to know of the impending darkness. The sky grew darker as clouds seemed to cover the sky. A million thoughts were running through his head. His family, was in danger, but more than that, his universe was in danger. Everything he was used to, everything he grew to love could change this very second. He closed his eyes, seeming to say 'Thank You' to no one. Surely if he said thank you, the universe would atleast know he was not taking advantage of his graced exsistance.<br>
<br>
&quot;Brother, you musn't tell anyone of what I just told you. Time is a extremely fragile thing. I will help to this cause with everything I am. I will alert the Council of Time of which I am leader to do all they can to delay the impending evil. I will appeal to them brother, it will be done. For the Hours they do my bidding, and I am sure the Seasons will be of great help. Trust in my power and in your own, for no one can give you more strength than you can give yourself.&quot; he pointed to Hermes's chest, as if to say all the power needed was located within him. As if the only way to beat this was if everyone believed in themselves, for anything was possible if one believed something to be true with his whole being.<br>
<br>
Apollo smiled to Hermes. He ruffled the boys hair laughing. He always found a way to lighten up the most dark of moments as if not by his obvious light aura, but by his inner optimism he was able to shake off anything negative. He soon pulled Hermes into a &quot;noogie&quot; ruffaling his hair further laughing. He soon though, released him with a smile<br>
<br>
&quot;Let us get started mon frére.

The blue crystal had been lit for a while, but for the denizens of this realm, it had not been deemed urgent.  But now it had become more than a nuisance.  Order amongst chaos, and chaos amongst order.  What had once been a single snooper, had not spread to encompass others.  Now these creatures were in a frenzy, trying to cope with the new factors in the equation.<br>
<br>
The blue was lit, sure.  But a black and silver crystal had been lit also.  Then recently a purple and white had too.  Chittering loudly amongst themselves, the sound echoing throughout the room, it would be as if you  suddenly found yourself burried up to your neck in mealworms, and their incessant chittering driving you insane.<br>
<br>
Imps began to appear in the room.  Their amber eyes seemed to be floating in the midst of darkness.  They flew above the heads of the insectoids, waiting to do their duties.  The insect watchers started reguritating gelatinous balls, and then handed them to the imps.  The language of these creatures are indescipherable, but they made excellent spies.  They had developed a way to communicate with other species through their secretions.  Only those skilled in reading saliva would be able to understand.<br>
<br>
The imps disappeared into tiny vortexes of their own creations.  Delivering the news that it may be time to act, and soon.  Too many have gotten wind of their activities.<br>

<br>
:<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ionysus, I think it would be best if you entered into Poseidon's realm.  I have not been given permission yet, and to this day, I have not been able to collect the souls that have been lost at sea.  But I believe that there is a lot to be found there, if you are able to.  <br>
<br>
The Hindus believe that the world actually rests upon a giant tortoise that is plodding through the universe.  I do not know if this is true, but from what I have gathered from the Tree, there is an old hobbit that does live deep within the Indian Ocean, where exactly I am not sure.  Supposedly he has deep ties with the Tortoise, what kind, I am again not sure.  But there are problems even before you can reach him.  I am sure <br>
Grunkar's minions are everywhere, so do not be surprised if you do meet up with them.  But the true challenge would be persuading the old hobbit to assist us.  You see, the Hindus believe in reincarnation, and that everything occurs cyclically.  That means that they believe what is happening now had transpired before.  Therefore he may not see the need to assist us because that would be interrupting the cycle.  It would be up to you.<br>
<br>
Apollo, you have to go to Egypt, where Nike seems to call home.  There you have to go to their underworld, ruled by their god, Osiris.  Osiris is actually more tempestuous than our own Hades.  But I believe, since you represent light, and therefore life, he has no reason not to at least admit your presence.  But again, be careful.  you will have to be judged first.  Your worthiness will be weighed against that of a feather.  If you are found unworthy, sinful, and therefore your soul is heavier than that of the feather, they may condemn you to eternal torture.  But because you are a god, you should have at least a fighting chance.  <br>
<br>
But remember both of you, you two are entering into the realms of other gods, and therefore your powers will not be as great as they are here.  While there, the deities that rule supreme will have greater control.  Therefore you will have to utilize more of your wits than your brawn.<br>
<br>
Dionysus, when you are in India.  You must ascertain whether or not Krungar has affected them yet, which I believe that he has.  I believe there is an object that the old hobbit knows about, with which Krungar needs to revive himself.  But once again, I am unsure what it may be.<br>
<br>
As for you, Apollo, your job is also similar, but different as well.  When in Egypt, you need to discover what it is Krungar is after.  There are multiple artifacts that Krungar wants or may need.  One that I know of is the feather with which Osiris weighs the souls of the recently departed.  He will not be too willing to part with the feather for if he does, he will not be able to admit any more souls into his kingdom.  Therefore he will guard it selfishly.  So even if you do not manage to obtain the feather, at least it will put Osiris on alert, and therefore prevent Krungar and his minions from obtaining the feather as well.  Krungar needs it, so that he may bypass his imprisonment in Tartarus.  If he can somehow utilize the feather's powers, thereby lightening the sins which burden his soul, then his sould will be able to leave Tartarus.  Once that happens, it opens up a path for his body to leave as well.<br>
<br>
But as I said, there are other artifacts in Africa, in fact throughout the entire planet that could be used.  Therefore I can't stress the urgency of the matter.  We do not have much time.  For every wall we put up against Krungar, another path has opened that we do not know about.  <br>
<br>
While you two are gone, I will interrogate this demon here, and then proceed with some of my other leads.  I pray that the next time we meet, we will have made greater strides in stopping Krungar.<br>

It already knew, even before the imps had arrived with the message from the insectoids.  The frigure was frustrated because its attempts at eavesdropping upon the immortals while they were at the Tree of Time had failed.  It seems the Tree has taken an active part in this matter.<br>
<br>
No matter, thought the cloaked stranger.  It knew that as soon as the immortals left the Tree's domain, the deities could be tracked.  And sure enough, not long afterwards, the god known as Dionysus had departed.<br>
<br>
::So he's going off to Africa, and it seems he may be heading off to India.  But what could be going there for?<br>
<br>
The figure pondered a bit.  It knew that the people of India were a very mystical and complex race.  Some mortals seem to contain powers that even rivaled their gods.  But why was Dionysus doing there?<br>
<br>
::There is a temple in Southern India that contained vitae from a long forgotten god.  But what could he want with that?<br>
<br>
Shaking its head, the figure thought some more.<br>
<br>
::There is a guru in Delhi that supposedly has the power to peer into any beings mind.  Maybe he's going there to contact the man, in hopes of figuring out what Grunkar has planned.  Yes, I think that's what Dionysus wants.<br>
<br>
Chuckling, it sent a mental missive to the creatures that surrounded the tower.<br>
<br>
::Go.  Go to India and take care of the guru.  Do not let Dionysus get in contact with him.<br>
<br>
As the creatures took off to do the bidding of their master.  The master of the tower returned back to its scrying pool.<br>
<br>
Luckily for Dionysus, the master of the Tower had come up with the wrong conclusion.  Dionysus's task is to contact the Old Hobbit beneath the sea.  Hopefully, the Tower Master will not discover this.  <br>
