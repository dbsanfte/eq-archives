It was true that she wasn't an Amazon by birth, she was a Roman from Ephesus who had fled from her home to live between the Amazons and had been accepted in Chadesia's tribe by Queen Varia.<br>
<br>
She was now feeling like if she had no identity, she never felt she belonged to the Roman Empire, and she was feeling that the Amazons would ever consider her as a Roman stranger. And she was hating Rome's imperialism and patriarchy, having been the victim of a violent father, her best friend Myrene, an  Amazon working as priestess in the Artemision having been murdered by three drunken Roman soldiers, her life threatened. And she was terribly worried for Octavia, her ill mother and Margarita Cecilia, her 15 years old sister who had stayed in Ephesus to take care of her mother. But she had to flee, or would have been killed. Or by the violent fiancé her father had given her, or by her father himself. In Roman law, the father had the right to kill his wife and children if they were resisting to his authority. And Livia not only refused to marry her fiancé, but also accused him of having participated in Myrene's assassination, having been the only witness of the cold blooded murder of the young priestess.<br>
<br>
Livia was hating Rome as no one<br>
<br>
&quot; I'm one of yours, Livia Diana, from Chadesia. But I was born in Ephesus, Roman by birth, Amazon by choice&quot; she responded politely,in all honesty but at the same time looking like asking her if she was considerating her as one of her sisters or as a stranger. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/usheyala.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sheyala</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 440<br> <font color=#993300>(6/26/02 11:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Friend or Foe?</span><hr size=1> Shey swallowed and smiled.<br>

For a Roman young woman, she was a good warrior, having learned the basics of staff fighting and archery from Myrene having played with her brother's wood sword as a child and also being a great horsewoman. But in Amazon standards she would be an amator.<br>

&quot;If your a Roman then why do you worship the Greek gods?&quot;<br>
<br>
Ardyn stopped trusting Romans easily when one of them killed Tyger, her mother. She didn't even trust Sarabi Falco, the High Priestess of Athena. Sarabi was a very good friend of The Vasilissa, Varia.<br>
<br>
Ardyn still had mailce in her heart from the death that had surrounded her. Outsiders like Zelia, Hope, and Carlira had tried to bring down the Amazons and each time Ardyn's heart would grow colder to newcomers.<br>
<br>
She trusted Sheyala because of her connections with Hippolyte. Hippolyte is a living legend to all Amazons, God worshipping or not.<br>

My best friend was a priestess of Artemis and she changed my life forever...&quot;<br>
<br>
Her voice broke as she remembered the tragic fate of Myrene, a young Amazon orphaned when Roman soldiers invaded her village and killed Myrene's mother and sister. The child had been found by priestesses of Artemis wandering alone around the Artemision and adopted and raised by them in the temple. Her short life had ended when three drunken Roman soldiers attacked her in the forest, one of them was the fiancé given to Livia. It was Livia herself who had found the unfortunate Myrene and brought her to the temple and she had fought for her friend's life as well as the priestesses who had adopted her. But hopelessly, Myrene gave her last breath in front of her despaired Roman friend who fought to make justice made, denouncing those crimes, she became herself a target, had been severely beaten by her father and had to flee to save her life. To be identified to those criminals was breaking her heart<br>
<br>
&quot; My people committed horrible crimes, invaded nations, but we aren't all bad, I've never been proud of my Roman identity but I have to accept it.I'm a woman of the people, not a soldier and had my share of suffering, I suffered from my own people's patriarchic system, corruption and imperialism, more than you could ever think. But I have no power on my people as I'm a woman, and in Rome and her colonies, women have no rights. If I was born in nobility, maybe I could have more influence but I'm not. But what is Rome, an idea, an illusion... I'm a human like you and if Rome would invade Chadesia, I promise that I would fight at your side. Please don't think that all Romans are enemies of the Amazons, I share your grief and more than you could ever think. What could I do to be trusted by you and no more being judged for my Roman blood rather than who I am&quot;<br>
<br>
Once again, Livia was feeling that terrible duality and like an apatrid, born as Roman but Amazon by soul. Accepted by none. Hated by many Romans, distrusted by many Amazons... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamznlyli.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AmznLyli</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#993300>(6/28/02 11:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An Untrusting to Romans</span><hr size=1> ::Lyliane listened to them silently as she walked over to the falls quietly.

<br>
Livia was also an enemy of Rome, Rome, Master of the World...Hating Rome's imperialism and conquests, her reign of destruction and deaths. Livia's father himself had been corrupted by Rome's politics and had become a monster, violent with his family and hating strangers. After serving in the army, Livia's father had never been the same, beating his children, and became more and more dominator and violent. Livia had lived in fear, abused by her father, who gave her a murderor for fiancé and was beating her each time she was disobeying to his authority, she was also a victim of Rome, where the father had the right of life and death on his wife and children<br>

Of Livia, the bitch of Rome, she was sharing only the name, Livia Diana Tarquinia was of Roman blood but was born and grew up in Ephesus, was feeling guided by Artemis, was only an innocent, abused young woman of the popular class, hating Rome as no Roman could, sister and ally of the Amazons <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/usheyala.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sheyala</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 441<br> <font color=#993300>(6/28/02 6:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Come now..</span><hr size=1> Shey could sense the unease from Ardyn.  It radiated like the sun on a hot summer day, but she said nothing, as she was prone to sensing emotions.  She looked to Livia too, and she could sense that she was lonely.. more than anything wanted to fit in.  Shey too was not of amazon blood... she too had taken a long time to gain trust, but it could be accomplished.  Shey again smiled at Livia hoping to comfort. She would ask Ardyn later about her mistrusts.. but for now she didn't want Livia to get completely grounded by fiercness or distrust.  Seeing Lyli another amazon enter the area and nod, shey waved in return, a smile on her face.  She didn't know either of these women very well.. but she felt it a job to know her sisters.<br>
<br>
&quot;I believe you would Livia.  You seem like one that wouldn't break her word.&quot;  The rest... she decided to send through mindspeech.  She wasn't sure about how the other two would react to her statement and she didn't want to offend anyone.. it wasn't like her.. so she looked to Livia with a smile.<br>
&gt;&gt;Though, unfortunately, I can't speak for all of us here... I want you to know I will never discriminate you for being Roman. i too was born in a place of war unable to do anything.. I know how it feels to be unable to do anything about where you come from.. and unable to gain trust..&lt;&lt;<br>

<br>
Ardyn shook her head as the vision played out before her.<br>
<br>
&quot;No....Yakut's..&quot;<br>
<br>
She came out of her daze as the vision vanished, she looked up at Livia as if Livia could possibly understand. Of course, Livia probably didn't, Livia was a Olympian worshipper and had no connection to the world of the Ancient Ways of the Northern Amazons.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn it...&quot;<br>
<br>
She mumbled this while rubbing her forehead. The Imblance was no more. Yakut cleansing ritual had brought back the balance among the Northern Amazons.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sheyala, who ever you are and Lyli, I dont know what I just said to any of you but I just had a vision. One of great disturbance....So forgive me for anything....&quot;<br>

&quot; Yakut what?! What's happening and worrying you? You're looking as if the &quot; Champion of Rome&quot; had landed on the Amazon territory,as if anathema just happened.&quot; <br>
<br>
She was understanding nothing to those powers of balance and imbalance, as she wasn't understanding the Northern Amazons. For her, they were ever looking as if anathema was to happen and as if strangers were the cause of that anathema<br>

<br>
Ardyn gave a large sigh....<br>
<br>
&quot;The Northern Amazons are all connected through this balance of the soul....When one Amazon is off balance it affects every Northern Amazon....Yakut is my mentor and Teacher. She's an Amazon Shamaness and Former Amazon Queen of the Tanais River Valley....She was on the path of peace, no killing, no war, no weapons..nothing...She's broken her path of peace, She's made her first kill...and that threw us off balance...But now that she's had a cleansing ritual, the souls of the Northern Amazons are balanced once more...&quot;<br>
<br>
Ardyn fell back, sprawling out on the ground from disbelief, and completely being lost in thoughts.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am sooo sorry, Yakut...I should have been there. I should have came to protect you....Oh Ancients, blessed Ancestors help me...&quot;<br>
<br>
The Amazon continued whispering to herself.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm going to need a cleansing ritual myself....I didn't have one after Tyger's death but now Yakut has made her first kill...Gabrielle couldn't do it, to close to Olympian Gods....Terasi could...yes..Terasi.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ardyn sat up and looked at Livia.<br>
<br>
&quot;Look, I know your confused because your a Greek Amazon and Former Roman and all this is completely...odd to you but I'm not insane, it's just the Northern Amazons are the descendants of the one of the First Amazon Tribes called the Tretmolecs...We are all connected by blood and soul.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ardyn hoped to the Ancients this new one could understand. <p>-:¦:- Yakut -:¦:-<BR>
