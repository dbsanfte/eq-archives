They are 7-9 ft tall. very strong, almost imune to swords, arrows, and spears, but they will do nothing unless you tell them to do something.

&quot;Alright, we know that Hypnos' cobalts can travel underground and thanks to Madmartigan we also know that he has a special weapon that can make us lose easily. Post archers up on upper cliffs nearest Hypnos' army. Make sure that their arrows are lead. The 6th and 7th legion will take my banner and march up the left side of the field but stop before the first line. Take two sheilds each with with you. Once there place shields down and yours up for attack. When they attack the 5 legion which is behind them will throw the smoke bombs which will blind everyone. Thats what the second sheilds are for. The second and third legion will attack the main part of Hypnos' army. Its a Madmartigan that Hypnos underestimates the number of men I have. I have much more that him. I've called in a favour. Since another of my armies which is closer by is currently engaged in another war. Mars has lent me his army from the south to attack Hypnos' army from behind.Thus the enemy will eb crushed. And as for the mushroom, need not worry. I have a feelings I may have some-one from the inside. Mars' army will send archers and spearers upto behind Hypnos' army on the cliffs. the catapults we have will send burning fire into the middle of the army. this will be so much fun!!!! And then we can have total carnage!!!&quot;<br>

&quot;Lo, there do I see my father<br>
  Lo, there do I see my mother and my sisters<br>
     and my brothers<br>
  Lo, there do I see the line of my people back<br>
     to the beginning<br>
  Lo, they do call to me<br>
     They bid me take place among them<br>
       in the Halls of Valhalla<br>
