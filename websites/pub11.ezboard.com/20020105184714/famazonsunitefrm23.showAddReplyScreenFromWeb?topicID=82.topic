He has on golden shin guards, Golden sandles with laces that round his ankles and calves, a corslet made of gold and inlaid with adamante, a red velvet cloak he wears over his shoulders and back, and over his dark curls he has a golden helm with a feather plume on top. Under his armour he wears a white tunic, outlined with gold with two straps that come over each shoulder. His arms rest on the arm rests on his throne and he leans his head back on the throne. As his eyes waver across the lands far below he notices a place of great importance. His eyes linger upon the place for a few minutes. The god pushes off from the throne with his arms and then shifts all his weight onto his legs. He picks up a golden lance about 4 feet in length and a scaboard with a sheathed sword. The hilt of the sword is made of silver and has many jewels encrusted in it. He tosses the scaboard over his shoulder as well as a round shield made of gold. With his equipment ready the god floats down from Olympus to the mountain from which he can see old Ilion and Argos. Here is where Zeus navigated the Trojan war and Hera kept him aloof while making love to him. Poseidon sits down underneath a crevace which is overhead and puts his lance upon the floor. His armour clanks loudly as he sits down. He looks around and sighs with relief and satisfaction.::<br>

&quot;I feel as if I now rule the world. That can only be a wish now. Zeus is invincibly strong and fast, and I only rate second to him.&quot;<br>

A smile played itself across his delicate angelic face as he heared the unmistakable voice of his uncle Poseidon.<br>
<br>
He stepped to the thrown room, the shadows illuminated by his golden aura. He brought his hand to his mouth and clears his throat to make his presence known. He smiles to Poseidon and crosses his arms while leaning against a pillar, the whole time that same confident yet unaggressive smile on his face. His body adorned in asian robes, his hair unusually long;for him atleast. Yet his face remains without stubble. His crystilian eyes meet Poseidon.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh, tis the dream of most to hold that power that belongs to only and exclusivly to our Father God, the mighty Zeus. Tis it not dear Uncle? Yet it was a while ago, I was a still a boy, when he stated of the sweat to be broken by battling you his dearest and nearest of brothers. Since then times have changed.&quot; He nods saying just this as he moves to the balcony and grasps the railing, closing his eyes and smelling the crisp clean moutain air.<br>
<br>
&quot;I suggest that you, in sorts change your opinions or loyalty dearest Uncle. Tis me, Apollo that is second that to the almighty Zeus, along with my sister Athena. Though, yes we are no match for Zeus, I suggest you make sure you are alone when &quot;whispering&quot; your dreams to the world. For who knows? I could have been Zeus.&quot;<br>

 He crosses his arms and smirks, looking back at Poseidon.<br>

&quot;You two, or maybe just you Amphitrite, should know that the power of a god lies not only in his or her blood line. You forget some key factors. If you have not noticed, the second generation of deities seem to hold a more, divine power of sorts, for tis they who command some prime things. My heart, is purer than that of Poseidon, which empowers me more off. Also, yes he controls the sea and the shaking of the earth, but who is it that provides the light by which all things good, all things pure reside? I also myself hold the support of mortals and immortals alike. For I am a more liberal, kind god and am supported by mortals second to only my father. My temper is almost none, which alows me to make the right decision on battles. I and Athena hold the power to over throw Father Zeus.&quot;<br>

He turns his head slightly to look at Apollo. Poseidon reclines himself in the chair as he listens to Apollo's rantings about him being the stronger god. Poseidon keeps his hard gaze on Apollo as he walks around and runs his mouth. As he listens Poseidon brings his right hand up to his chin and gently strokes it with his thumb and fore-finger. He does not give any of his attention to the other immortals as they appear one after the other. After Poseidon feels that Apollo has said enough he brings his thoughts to attention.::<br>
<br>
&quot;Is that so lord Apollo? You are stronger than I and more fit a ruler? You've held these conceptions about yourself for the longest. You do not know the peak of my power nor have you witnessed it. You say the younger generation is the stronger, you and Athena are best fit to be rulers. I say you are an idiot. I tell you now the Titans are by far stronger than you are and were you there to fight them you would have surely been destroyed. And here's something else, the Titans are stronger than all the gods upon Olympus. Not even Zeus can compare with their power. I know you've heard the stories, how Zeus got the help of the other ancient gods that were locked up in Tartarus. These were the ones who defeated the Titans, it was with their strength that we triumphed. Your little idea about the older generation of gods being less powerful can be thrown out the window. And none of the Olympians are stronger the Zeus, Hades and I. In fact each generation of gods becomes less and less powerful.&quot;<br>
<br>
::Poseidon laughs at the lord of Light.::<br>
<br>
&quot;And this Golden Age of yours could never come about. You don't have power enough to hold the universe together. For if you were  King of the Gods I being the more powerful would toss you into the deepest depths of Tartarus and lock you up there with my aunts and uncles. Then you could show them if you like how powerful the younger generation is. They would laugh and scoff at your power compared to theirs.&quot; <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uposeidonkofc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poseidonkofc</A> at: 6/26/01 3:53:23 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uthegreatapollo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Great Apollo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(6/26/01 4:02:01 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Is that so?</span><hr size=1> &quot;Hold your toung Poseidon. For of speaking of such, I do not imply any disrespect. Everyone here has opened their mind to other possibilities, please do the same. And for me saying the second generation being stronger I do not mean by might. Ofcourse the &quot;Titans&quot; will forever be the strongest. But stronger I mean in other ways, in ways of well, manipulation and other less physical means. And I am sorry but Zeus was not born with the title of &quot;King of the Heavens&quot;. If I remember my stories right, at first he was a very shaky leader. As would ANYONE, when first put into power. You are very ignorant to think that if you took power you would be accepted by all, and be the perfect leader. My might may not lie in the same area's as you but it is deffinetly in ways...and I stress it when I say IN WAYS, equal or superior to you in power. As is each god over another.&quot;<br>
<br>
He stays calm and just sits there, making eye contact with Poseidon, not taking his warm stare off of him.<br>
<br>
&quot;And you now, sit boasting  of your powers as the more powerful god. If you think... Zeus or any god for that matter, is only as powerful as the rest of us make him or her. If as a society or a group did not see Zeus fit for leadership, he would have been knocked down in power LONG ago. But as a community we all see his natural leadership qualities and therefor let him lead by example. It is by the choice of the governed and the governed alone to keep a government in tacked. If as a whole, the gods and immortals decided to throw Zeus from thrown it would be so, as he would have no allies. He would have no resources to aid his victory. If the Titans were so strong, then how did they lose? By the rest of the immortal community revolting. If we as a people, as a group, as a whole, decide to change, then it would change.&quot;<br>
<br>
He stands a bit, his stare still fixed on Poseidon.<br>
<br>
&quot;And I resent you disrespecting me as a person Poseidon. We here, are just talking of things that have been waiting to be discussed. And you over there on your egotistical, arrogant high horse, boast about how you could give Zeus a run for his money. Well no you could not dearest uncle, not without the support of the community. And you obnoxious, introverted, and down right mean demenor, has earned you no real friends here on Olympus. Most fear you, and very little respect you fully. I am one of the few that respect you, as I have seen you at your best, and under it all you are a very level headed divinity. Respect will take a man much farther than fear will ever take him. Fear and respect look the same on the outside, but respect is a much greater force. And my father Zeus has earned the respect of the immortal community through acts of just judgment, and selfless acts. His acts are not self motivated or self seeking. And of the laughing and scoffing, done by the Titans to me, when you &quot;toss me into the darkest depths of Tatarus&quot;, people already laugh and scoff about you behind your back! I am sure that it is done about me, about all of us, but your right up there with the worst of them. Who knew that the brother of two such level headed, well adjusted divinities could turn out so wrong!&quot;<br>
<br>
He brushes the hair from his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have grown tired of  your ways Poseidon. I do not know what you are going through, what you have went through, or what you THINK you are about to go through, but it has changed you, and I believe I can speak for everyone when I say I am sick of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
He crosses his arms, his eyes showing less respect for uncle than ever before. To think that just a few years ago he regarded Poseidon as one of the gods that he wanted to emulate. He scowls at this thought now.<br>
<br>
'He should be ashamed of himself...' he says to himself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFF33>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#FFFF33> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23>The Olympian Gods</a> <font color=#FFFF33> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#FFFF33> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
