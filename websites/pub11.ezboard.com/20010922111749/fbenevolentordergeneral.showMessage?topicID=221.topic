<br>
As one grows older in life, they are faced with a multitude of tough decisions.  The paths we create with those decisions influence us for the rest of our lives.  I present myself before you today because I have met one of those difficult forks in the road.<br>
<br>
When Atacand was created, he had 2 basic goals in mind.<br>
1) To create bonds, make new friends, and keep in touch with RL friends.<br>
2) To generally work for the betterment of Norrath while advancing in experience.<br>
<br>
I have no doubt that I have fulfilled my goals in regards to #1.  I have met some incredible new friends, that were there at my beckoned call to help me in any way that they can.  For that I am extremely grateful.  My dilemma comes with goal #2.  Although I have no doubt that I have made Norrath better by being a member of Ben Order, I have come to see this achievement in duality.  At times in life, one must better themselves in order to better those around them.  Depending on the way you see it (unfortunately or not), I have come to the point that I have exhausted my ability to be able to advance without the aid of numerous people.  I have recently found myself grouping as a constant group with some excellent former Ben Order members.  (How do I know they're excellent??? They were at one time a member of Ben Order <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
I want each and every past, current, and future Ben Order guild member to realize that they are my friend.  I hold this guild very responsible for my achievements to date.  Likewise, much of my success in the future will be due to the lessons I have learned as being a part of this wonderful guild.  I ask you not to think of this as me leaving Ben Order, but more like a parent raising a child and it leaving home for the first time.  That child is forever related and is eternally attached to the parents, much like I am to Ben Order.<br>
<br>
I will continue to post to BO's message board, and make sure those responsible for my success are due theirs as well.<br>
<br>

I'm still puzzled why we lost so many people to Kakkarot's guild.  Nothing against Kakk, I just don't get it.  I am beginning to fear the demise of Benevolent Order since we obviously can't retain members once they get to a certain level.  I don't really understand why, but if people would hang around then maybe we could get strong enough to do some things.  (Don't take this as being directed only at you, Atacand.)  I'm just stating that it upsets me when we lose members.  I thought we were rebuilding nicely and that we might even have a chance to add a few higher level members, but now that there are only 3-4 of us above 35 and none above 40, I don't think that's too possible.<br>
<br>
Our officer situation has gone haywire as many of the officers are rarely online, and I'm starting to wonder what to do.  I don't know if we need to try another re-org like I tried to implement before, or whether I should just give up and let our guild just be a chat link for friends.<br>
<br>
My semester has started now, and I will not be able to play a whole heck of a lot.  This is my last semester of college, and it is quite important to me.  Also, my job search <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> has</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to be kicked into high gear if I want to be able to support myself after graduation.  All this means that I cannot do everything by myself, and I think that we need others to step up.<br>
<br>
Tonight I made Dadijob an officer.  I am sure that she will be a good one.  Hopefully, she, Valmar, Elupis and I can pull things together, otherwise I fear there is not much hope.  We will continue to lose members.<br>
<br>
I plan to post a recruiting notice on the Prexus.com messageboards this weekend.  We really need some help, I think.  If you guys have any thoughts, please let me know.  I'm just frustrated right now.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Good luck to you and your pursuits, Atacand.  That goes to Elbrian too.  I wish you guys would have hung around for a while and helped me try to get some more members around our level, but you gotta do what you gotta do. <p><hr>

In fact I have had a couple of chats with people that have left and I guess I got tired of trying to take the burden upon myself to get them to stay , that and the fact that my online time has been cut drastically with me going back on days , those being the primary reason I no longer wanted to be Guild leader anymore. Sorry to those I disappointed in that respect but you have to understand I tend to be a pretty solitary person at times and really don't relish the role of others looking to me for guidance or depending on me in this role. Frustration and disappointment come to mind when I think of all the good people who have left for greener pastures in other guilds. Sorry to kinda vent there but I figured I had to say something to kinda explain myself and how I feel.<br>

<br>
I can certainly understand your frustration on this one.  However, with time, I think you will come to understand why I had to make this terribly difficult decision.  Valmar and I have had a lengthy discussion over this, and I hope that at least a portion of my gratitude to this guild was displayed in that.<br>
<br>
On the contrary, I also tried to make my point with EQ and Paladins in general with Valmar.  Aye, Valmar, I am a very solitude person as well.  I hope Val doesn't mind, but I'm going to just relate on small story for a second.  On numerous occasions Val has tried to complete the beggar portion of the SF quest in EFP.  Being a solitary &amp; strong-willed person, he felt that he could do this on his own.  However, Val has reached a stage in his career where he can no longer be this way.  It is a MUST that you are willing to accept help from others my friend.  Accepting help is in no way a sign of weakness or intelligence.  All it took was a simple duo, and we wacked out this portion of his quest in no time.  Keep your thoughts of solitude and singularity Val, I see nothing wrong with that my friend because you and I are one in the same in that arena.  I do urge you though to understand that people WANT to help you, we LIKE helping you, and it is an attribute to our success to see the success of a friend increase.  <br>
<br>
Now for me, I am at the stage of my career where my quests and armor require not 2 people, not 1 group, but numerous groups.  And it is almost this sole reason that I had to make the decision I did.  Many of you may say, &quot;well, you were getting offers to go on raids already, so you will get to go even though you are a member of Ben Order.&quot;  Very true.  My ability to attend raids would not be prohibited that much by being a member of Ben Order.  I'm fortunate enough to have some high level friends that could get me in the occasional plains raid.  How about when I go for that epic??  The FD requires a giant group of people in order to complete.  Even though I do have a handful of high level friends, they just won't cut it.  I'm going to have to have a handful of *groups* in order to obtain my FD.  I just don't think that I will be able to achieve that without the help of a high level guild supporting me.<br>
<br>
Lastly Gira, I would like to address your issue of rebuilding.  Yes, Ben Order is gaining membership quite well.  It is not an uncommon thing to see my screen fill up when I do a /who all benevolent.  On the contrary, I urge you to take a look at alot of those levels, and who alot of those members are.  Those that are capable of helping me have RL issues that definitely take precedence over any game.  I commend each and every one of you for realizing that, and taking the time to attempt to live a healthy lifestyle (for those of you that don't know, I'm a medical student, and RL and health issues are my true love).<br>
<br>
One last thing, if I truly am your friend, then why does it matter what it says next to my name?  In my eye, it shouldn't.  I still continue to talk to, and I know you do to Gira, to RL friends that are members of other guilds.  (*cough cough* Aislynn &amp; Allerielle)<br>
<br>
Take care my friends.  Understand my decision isn't one I took litely, and I urge you to contact Petra if you think that this was a spur of the moment decision on my part.  Each of you are my friends, and our days of grouping together are not over, unless you succumb to that feeling that I made my decision based on animosity and remorse.<br>

It just makes me sad that I am left with only one RL friend in the guild - Mathusis.  He is busy with other things and doesn't have the time to play as much as others.  Surely you can understand the feeling of being deserted.  I felt that way when Elbrian and Ndirya left the first time.  Now I'm feeling the same way, even moreso though, since I am now leader and was counting on you for help in leading.  I know that you will be there to help us with guild events, but it seems silly to ask you to help me try to rebuild things when you're not even a member anymore.<br>
<br>
I just got home and I'm going to log on quickly to try to help you out with Lucan. <br>

   Damn, this is a sad occasion.  I wish to post my regrets here as well, I regret that I wasn't able to get some PL love sooner from Atacand <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but maybe now that he's going to be a high and mighty bad-ass he'll remember the little people who saved his ass in Blackburrow when he was just a wee lvl 10 wussy.  <br>
   On a brighter note, I am now starting to clear away all the crap and confusion that has cluttered my RL.  I appologize for the absence from the game and am attempting to fix that now.  RL is crazy for me right now with a black belt (in Tae Kwon Do) test within a month and all the stress and strain of whipping my ass into shape within 2 weeks.  My homework has increased exponentially and so I'm juggling as fast as possible because I feel a keen loss at not playing this game.  I'm not an addict, I can quit when I ... GOTTA PLAY... ermmmm heheh...  Anyways, just thought I would tell you that I'm not dead, eaten or worse.  I do have the machine that goes &quot;ping&quot; (For all you Monty Python fans.) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> g   So until I get back in game good luck, get your levels and be ready to powerlevel my ass when I get back <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
