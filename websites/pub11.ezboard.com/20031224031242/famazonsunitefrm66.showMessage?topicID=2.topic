Eyes that were green and serious, like deep pools of darkness, lit like a sparkling flame as they glared across the Amazon lands.  Her lips were two dried red streaks, pressed resolutely together.  Her heavy tresses streamed to her waist, and changed color from russet flame to glowing black, ratted and tangled.  The roots of her tendrils were dampened from the sweat from the long journey.  Around her neck she adorned a heavy torc of bronze and gold, and a golden clasp pinned her amazon leathers of soft doe skin.  Her arms and thichs were circled with bracelets and her girdle glowed with rubies.  About her shoulders she wore the skin of a great white bear.  Altogether, she had a grim fierce air, no matter what her age is.<br>
<br>
Her steps were supported by a thick wooden staff that was blanketed with rubies.  A large cresent moon in the &quot;u&quot; position arrayed the top of the tall staff.  Both hands, heavily kissed with freckles, gripped tightly to the staff for better support.  Her strength was growing weak, for she had been traveling from the Land of Shadows non-stop.  She only stopped for emergency breaks.  <br>
<br>
Scathach finally ended the torture with an abrubt hault.  She still had hold of her breath, but she had lost complete hold of her strength.  This rest was much needed.<br>
<br>
(( Some text is from Llewellyn's Witches' Datebook 2003..since this is the first post..I needed a feel for her looks and what not.

Her ears back, the lioness knew the scent did not smell as if the bear was alive. But, it was still dangerous.  Slowely, she moved towards the scent and soon caught that of a human.  The second scent made her pick up her pace and soon, she was pearing thru the leaves of the brush at a woman laying down for a rest.  <br>
<br>
Watching, the lioness rippled her golden skin for a moment.  And then decided it was best not to appear to the resting on in her current form.  Lifting her nose up to check for the scent of any others, she felt it was safe.<br>
<br>
Soon, the lionesses form seemed to fade away and become like that around her.  Til her skin became hairless and the body transformed to that of a young huntress.  Standing now, clothed in very little leathers and the talons, claws, and fangs of victims.  The sumerian goddess Sin now stood holding her spear.  She was a lesser Goddess, who served the greater Hera in this region.  Slowely, she stepped out into the clearing and then stopped.  Waiting for the one to see her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shadowamazonscathach>Shadow Amazon Scathach</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#993300>(3/31/03 8:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm66.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/amazonwitchx/images/scatha1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Oh..</span><hr size=1> The young amazon had laid down on her back, covering her eyes from the sun with a slender and youthful arm blanketed with freckles.  The arm was slightly bruised and cut, no major injuries had been done--only those that bushes and other things of nature had caused.  Scatha stretched out her limbs into a comfortable position.<br>
<br>
The thick bear fur and skins made the perfect rest for her head, but was hot on her neck.  But the warmth comforted her, for she loved the warm temperatures.  The rest of the animals leathers which adorned her body made Earth's harsh ground more bearable, as well.<br>
<br>
She hadn't been laying in the ground for too long until she heard the soft rustling of leaves in the distant.  She paid no attention until she heard the rustling gradually strengthen in sound.  Scathach lifted her arm slightly, hiding the sun's harsh rays from her emerald occulars, and peered quickly over into the direction that the sound had come.  When the sound subsided, she spotted the young huntress and all of her senses fell into full alert.<br>
<br>
Scatha slowly, and easily lifted her weakened torso, leaving a slender hand over her eyes to shade them.  She blinked her pools a few times to make sure that the woman was no mirage.  When she decided that the woman was more reality than fiction, she greeted her to show the woman that she was no threat.  Her voice was deep but raspy, like soft bells ringing over familiar seas; and her accent was that like the Celts, but faded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Greetings, young huntress.  I do apologize that I cannot stand to greet you, but my body is weak from the long travels which I have made.  My name is Scathach nUanaind, and I come searching for my homeland, The Amazon Lands.  And may I ask who you might be?&quot; <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/aquavioiin/images/sword.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
She bent down on one knee next to Scathach.  &quot;You are safe now,&quot; she smiled resting a palm upon the witch's abdomen.  Yet, Sin's eyes locked onto the amazon before her.  As she touched the girl, the amazon could feel a warm sensation running thru her.  &quot;I cannot heal you, but for the moment, I can make your body not notice it's pain.&quot;<br>
<br>
Glacing over the girl's wardrobe, Sin looked for clues as to the amazons home city.  But, found known.  &quot;I can help you and show you the way to the amazon city or village that you have journeyed so far to find.  But, I see no decorations that mark you.

&quot;Thank you so much, Sin, goddess of Sumeria and servant of Hera.  Would you be so kind as to show me to Themiscrya.  I have some questions I would like to ask one of the triad of Queens.  It would be much appreciated.&quot;<br>

Scatha shifted her stance and hoped Sin would believe in the true sinserity. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/aquavioiin/images/sword.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
&quot;You sense magic, eh?  I do have a past unknown to me.  One morning I just remember awaking on a boat floating near Britannian shores.  It was just a few, perhaps two, years ago.  I know nothing of my youth.  And it's odd...others had mentioned feeling the presense of magic upon me as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
She shifted her stance before going on, looking off to the side of Sin.<br>
<br>
&quot;The reason why I have traveled here is because the commonfolk in Britannia said that I dressed like mythological Amazons, and the name oddly, sounds so familiar to me.  So, I have traveled here, in search for answers.&quot; <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/aquavioiin/images/sword.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
