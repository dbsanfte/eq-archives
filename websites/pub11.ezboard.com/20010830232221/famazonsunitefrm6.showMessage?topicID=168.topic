Hot patches of fog lay over the rivers and lakes, not a blow of wind stirred the flowers or the leaves on the trees, and Amazon women were not in a hurry to do chores or work. This was especially true for the 16 year old Amazon, Anck-su-namun.<br>
<br>
Anck-su-namun hadn’t done any work that day, but sat in her home, looking into her copper mirror, and wondering why she had to be so different in body than all other of her sisters. Her face was narrow, and deep.  Wide, interested green eyes lit her cheekbones; her small nose and large bee-stung lips contradicted each other. And, even though she was from Egypt, you could never tell. Her skin wasn’t the same tanned almond color as it once had been, but now a silky, pearl white. Her hair, once black, was now turning the same, dark red color as the fall leaves. Even though she was tall and thin, her arms and legs were unusually long and lanky. She felt ugly, lonely, and ignorant. <br>
<br>
Diminishing her own pity, Anck-su-namun threw down the mirror, and walked outside. As soon as she put one foot out of the door, heat came to her face like a bludgeon, beating her. She shut the door immediately and laid her body down on the cool marble. <br>
<br>
So much for that act of redemption, she thought sarcastically.<br>
<br>
Rolling her eyes and giving a deep, bored sigh, she pushed herself up with little effort and walked into her living room. <br>
<br>
My living room? Anck-su-namun thought with a smile.<br>
<br>
Her living room had once belonged to a warrior Amazon, Gwendolyn, Gwendolyn’s wife Rachel, and their children: Alanna, Alysia, Artemis, Thom, and Mordred. Gwendolyn, like Anck-su-namun, had been born in Egypt and was the daughter of the almighty Goddess Isis. When Rachel died, Gwendolyn went to Egypt for love and support, but only found ridicule and hatred. In spite of her mother’s calling, Gwendolyn killed herself. From her ashes Anck-su-namun was born, and, with help from Isis, Anck-su-namun found the Amazons once again. Through the Amazons love and support, Anck-su-namun began to learn more about Gwendolyn, but yet not enough. Gwen had never left one memory on a piece of paper. All she knew about Gwendolyn were the fates of her children:  Mordred had drowned, Alysia ran off to marry a Gorgon, Artemis was now living in Babylon making a wonderful salary as a prostitute, Alanna married a Higher King in Norway and was now training women to become soldiers, and Thom lived in Britain learning the ways of the Druids of Avalon. But, there was one thing Anck-su-namun DID know about Gwendolyn: what she looked like.<br>
<br>
In Gwendolyn’s bedroom, under her clothing press, Anck-su-namun had found a large metal canister, with a dial lock that resembled that of a safe. When she had finally managed to open it, she had found, to her surprise, that it did not contain jewels or gold, but a large rolled up canvas. When she unrolled it, Anck-su-namun found a piece of her past. On the canvas was a very detailed painting of Gwendolyn and Rachel. Looking at Gwendolyn and Rachel’s faces only made Anck-su-namun feel more ugly and undesirable. Gwendolyn was tall and thin, with beautiful hazel eyes and high cheekbones that complimented her wavy, strawberry blonde hair. Rachel was tall, dark and thin, with raven colored hair and mysterious, chocolate eyes. They looked like real Amazons: strength of beauty, body, and mind.<br>
<br>
“Bad memories,?” inquired a male voice in the doorway that Anck-su-namun didn’t recognize.<br>
<br>
With the quickness and agility of a wolf, Anck-su-namun turned around, pulled out a dagger and pointed it at her intruder. With her most flawless and fearless voice, Anck-su-namun screamed,<br>
<br>
“What are you doing in my home?”<br>
<br>
If she was meaning to create fear or alarm in this man, she was sourly mistaken. With grace and agility, he pulled of his dark riding cap to show a very handsome, amused face. Anck-su-namun looked deep into his eyes, and decided that he was not here to hurt her. Angry and embarrassed, she quickly put away her dagger and asked in her normal tone:<br>
<br>
“Can I help you sir?”<br>
<br>
The man grinned a bit, and looked around at his surroudings. Anck-su-namun studied his features, easily deciding that his face could be one on a Roman coin: He had short, neatly cropped black hair which contradicted his very moonlike pale skin, but did not diminish his good looks. His eyes were almost black, and when he looked at her, shivers went down her spine. His eyebrows were black, neat, and winged, and his nose was long and straight. He had no lines on his face, which gave Anck-su-namun the conclusion that he did not laugh or smile very often and could be no older than perhaps twenty.<br>
<br>
“Please, quit starring at me, I’m not armed.”<br>
<br>
The stranger’s voice broke through Anck-su-namun’s thoughts, and again embarrassed, she shyly smiled at him and took his cloak and hat. He was wearing all black, not to Anck-su-namun’s surprise, of course. And, again not to Anck-su-namun’s surprise, he moved easily, gracefully, and quickly made himself at home.<br>
<br>
Anck-su-namun did not like him at all.<br>
<br>
<br>
“Sir, why are you here?”<br>
<br>
The man lifted up his head, and again grinned a bit as if amused.<br>
<br>
“I came to return your owl, Hedwig.”<br>
<br>
“How did you know his name?”<br>
<br>
“He told me, and don’t call me Sir. I work for a living. My name is Aubrey.”<br>
<br>
Anck-su-namun rolled her eyes, and shuffled her two feet.<br>
<br>
“Is that all, Si—I mean, Aubrey?”<br>
<br>
“No, I came to give you a letter from Queen Alanna saying that she would be here in less than a month.”<br>
<br>
If it were not for Aubrey’s presence, Anck-su-namun was sure that she would have fainted at that moment. She grabbed onto the arm of a chair, sat down in it, and slowly cleared the million of questions that were bottling up in her mind. <br>
<br>
“May I read it?”<br>
<br>
“It’s your note.”<br>
<br>
With grace (and to Anck-su-namun’s displeasure) accuracy Aubrey threw the letter perfectly square in Anck-su-namun’s lap. With a deep, fearful sigh, Anck-su-namun picked up the letter with shaky fingers and broke the seal. She closed her eyes to gather up all her strength and started to read:<br>
<br>
To Lady Anck-su-namun of the Amazons<br>
From Lady Alanna, Queen of Norway<br>
<br>
Greetings Sister. I have received a letter from your Queen Alysia telling me of my Parents dear departure into the afterlife, and to my surprise, of your birth. Do not worry, I have grown up with the Amazons, my dearest, nothing is strange anymore. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I have sent my cousin Aubrey to deliver this message to you. I hope you find him pleasing and cordial, for he will be staying with you until my coming to your land. Please, do not be alarmed. He is an odd and somewhat “evil” man, but as long as you don’t bother him, you should exist peacefully together these next months.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Your lovely Queen has told me of your search for my Mother’s writings. I can happily say that I have her memoirs, and I will be coming with them. I hope you can read Egyptian hieroglyphics, for that is what they are written in. I can only read and speak Gaelic.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I eagerly await your response. Please, send it with your darling owl Hedwig, to whom I have come accustomed. I did not know he was yours, and I so regret not having sent him in earlier.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I will be departing on the arrival of your word.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gods Bless Dear Sister,<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Queen Alanna<br>
<br>
<br>
Anck-su-namun fingered and inspected the letter every which way, then looked at Aubrey (who had helped himself to a glass of wine) and said,<br>
<br>
“Is this it?”<br>
<br>
“I’m afraid so.” Then, he added with a grin, “How do you find my darling cousin?”<br>
<br>
Anck-su-namun, despite herself, smiled at Aubrey and answered,<br>
<br>
“She seems very ‘eager’ and ‘pleased’ and ‘happy.’”<br>
<br>
“That’s just a show. When you meet her, you shall have a different impression. I lived with Alanna for several years. Cousins get to know each other very easily.”<br>
<br>
Anck-su-namun nodded her head dumbly, and tried to think of what Alanna would look like. Since Gwendolyn was her mother and Aubrey was her cousin—<br>
<br>
Anck-su-namun’s train of thought had come to a new level.<br>
<br>
“ALANNA IS YOUR COUSIN??”<br>
<br>
Anck-su-namun looked at Aubrey with wide eyes and an open mouth. She jumped from her chair and paced around the knotted living room floor, and wondered how she hadn’t seen it. Her Mother and Aubrey had the same distinctive features. Were Aubrey and her related? She dearly hoped not. Gwendolyn only had one sibling, Sheftu, who had died fifty years before Gwendolyn...Aubrey must be his son. But, wouldn’t Aubrey be older?<br>
<br>
She eyed Aubrey cautiously, then added with a hint of ignorance,<br>
<br>
“Are you Sheftu’s and Nimiar’s son?”<br>
<br>
“I’m afraid so.”<br>
<br>
Again, she eyed Aubrey’s almost perfect face. <br>
<br>
“How old are you?”<br>
<br>
It was Aubrey’s turn to eye and look with caution. He searched Anck-su-namun’s body up and down with his eyes, then added,<br>
<br>
“Shall you write to Alanna?”<br>
<br>
Anck-su-namun sat back down in her chair, and put her chin on her hands. Looking at Aubrey’s face she easily decided that now was not the time to ask questions. She shifted the thoughts of Aubrey’s mysterious appearance, and concentrated on what to say to Alanna. Anck-su-namun could easily speak Gaelic, but she did not know the courier style of Norweigen writing. How did she salute Alanna? The same way that Alanna had addressed her in the letter? Anck-su-namun took a deep breath and sighed. She didn’t want to seem barbaric. <br>
<br>
As if reading her thoughts, Aubrey asked lazily,<br>
<br>
“Do you need help in writing a response?”<br>
<br>
Anck-su-namun looked up at him and blushed a bit at her ignorance of cultures, and replied softly,<br>
<br>
“If you wouldn’t mind.”<br>
<br>
“That’s what I’m here for.”<br>
<br>
Aubrey got to his feet, stretched, and asked where he could find a quill and parchment. Anck-su-namun directed him to her study, and he laughed at the owl feather and papyrus. This was the first real laugh she had heard from Aubrey, and it sounded somewhat kind, so she decided not to let it sting. <br>
<br>
Anck-su-namun and Aubrey walked back into the living room, and sat down on the marble.<br>
<br>
“Let’s start with a---oh, forgive me, I forgot. Do you want Alanna to come?”<br>
<br>
“Of course!”<br>
<br>
Aubrey again grinned a little and dipped the quill in ink.<br>
<br>
“We’ll start off with a salutation, exactly like the one Alanna gave you.”<br>
<br>
Almost exactly as he started to write, he stopped and looked down at the ink on the papyrus. He sniffed the ink, dipped his finger and took a taste of it. Aubrey pulled his finger out of his mouth, and looked at Anck-su-namun in surprise. Anck-su-namun returned the look questioningly, then smiled a little.<br>
<br>
“I write in my enemies blood.”<br>
<br>
“I’ve already seen that. Do all Amazons?”<br>
<br>
“No, we write with what we prefer. We’re not lemmings, we can all think for ourselves.”<br>
<br>
Aubrey nodded his head, and looked back down at the blood.  He coughed a little and took another taste. Anck-su-namun glared at him, and when he caught Anck-su-namun’s glance, Aubrey replied hastily,<br>
<br>
“So, shall we write?”<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Night had snuck up on the Amazon land, and Anck-su-namun returned from battle practice to find Aubrey sitting on a chair, and looking at the moon.<br>
<br>
“Beautiful, isn’t it?”<br>
<br>
Anck-su-namun smiled at him, and pulled up a chair near the window where Aubrey was sitting. Before she replied, she looked at his face which was now shining in moonlight. He looked different from when she had seen him last, as if he felt refreshed. <br>
“Did you feast, Aubrey?”<br>
<br>
Aubrey’s head snapped around to meet her eyes, and he asked harshly,<br>
<br>
“What do you mean?”<br>
<br>
“You look more...refreshed? I don’t know the word. Did you eat? My sisters were having a feast tonight and I Genesis told me she saw you leave. I thought you went”<br>
<br>
The caution in Aubrey’s eyes had fled, and he put a beautifully carved hand to his chin and rubbed his unshaved face. His eyes flickered back to the moon, and he answered with a perfectly calm, unbroken voice, (which did not have the male ackwardness that accompanied with being young)<br>
<br>
“Yes, I did feast. Thank you for your concern.”<br>
<br>
And with that, he quickly sat up and walked outside. Anck-su-namun never heard him come in, and when she checked his room in the morning, the bed was made and there was no sign that he had been there at all. <br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Two weeks had passed and Aubrey did not return. <br>
<br>
Anck-su-namun had sent her response to Alanna, and almost three days afterwards Alanna had sent word that she had shipped out and would be there not in a month, but two weeks since the winter had not yet settled in. Then another letter came a weeks later, saying that Alanna had arrived in Amazons territory and would be there in four days hence. She was expected today.<br>
<br>
Anck-su-namun had cleaned her rather large home top to bottom, and she and fellow Amazons had cooked food to last another week (the length of Alanna’s visit.)<br>
<br>
She was very used to wearing men’s clothing, even so, she picked out her best: black, leather breeches, a crimson shirt, black boots, and she also wore Gwendolyn’s silver and pearl Ankh. She had tied her hair back and plaited it with Gwendolyn’s silver clasps, and she was almost happy when she looked into the mirror. Black suited her complection and hair color well.<br>
<br>
“Alanna will be here shortly. Thought you might like a head start.”<br>
<br>
Anck-su-namun was startled by the familiar voice, but then smiled to herself, wondering how Aubrey had almost managed to get into her locked home and not make a noise.<br>
<br>
“Thank you, Aubrey.” She turned around a stared him in the face, “How do I look?”<br>
<br>
Aubrey stepped back to inspect her, then after a minute, he looked at Anck-su-namun and said plainly,<br>
<br>
“Beautiful.”<br>
<br>
A loud, musical laugh filled Anck-su-namun’s bedroom, and both she and Aubrey turned around to see a beautiful woman there, dressed in a long skirt of emerald and a shirt of pearl. <br>
<br>
“Now, dear cousin, do we always tell women this when we first walk into the door?”<br>
<br>
Aubrey seemed unamused and rather annoyed at the woman’s joke.<br>
<br>
“Come, Alanna, would you like to meet the person you came here to see?”<br>
<br>
Alanna, Queen of Norway, stepped closer to Anck-su-namun to inspect her. From what Anck-su-namun could get from that emotionless face, Alanna was not impressed.<br>
<br>
Anck-su-namun thought differently, however. <br>
<br>
Alanna was tall, thin, and curved in all the right places. Her hair was a deep, curly red, and only came to her shoulders. Her skin had a dark tan, and the emerald and pearl of her clothing only made her look more vuluptious. Her eyes were the same mysterious, chocolate brown as Rachel’s, and she had Gwendolyn’s hooked nose and stubborn chin. Her voice, however musical, was high and cackled. Anck-su-namun thought that reflected on Alanna’s personality, which, from what she could tell so far, was boring and in great need of intellect.<br>
<br>
“I’m afraid I can’t stay the week I planned...I have only came here to give you my mother’s writings.”<br>
<br>
Alanna held out her hand and it  was a thick, black book. When Anck-su-namun took it, she saw that it had a Celtic pentagram on it, and a viper tangling around the edges.<br>
<br>
When she looked up to say thank you to Alanna, she had already left. Aubrey stood there, looking at her, and asked,<br>
<br>
“Are you going to read or gawk at it?”<br>
<br>
Anck-su-namun hit Aubrey in the sides, and with a lot of effort, opened the book which was blank, only for one page that said:<br>
<br>
Beware of Level 3, Anck-su-namun<br>
<br>
“She knew your name.”<br>
<br>
“I guess she must have saw me before she died.”<br>
<br>
“Makes sense.”<br>
<br>
Aubrey and Anck-su-namun looked at each other, and she asked sternly,<br>
<br>
“Do you know what Level 3 is?”<br>
<br>
Aubrey eyes didn’t stir from hers, and he replied, with deep arrogance and cruelty,<br>
<br>
“I’m Level 3, Anck-su-namun.”<br>
