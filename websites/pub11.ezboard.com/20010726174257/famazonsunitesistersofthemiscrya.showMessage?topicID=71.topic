Aly was the exception. She was as usual out in the main area of the village, close to the queen's hut but far enough away for her to practice her shamaness works as well as her training. She had her long blonde hair pulled up into a tight ponytail and she was wearing her old leather training outfit. Her leather skirt clung to her legs as she fliped through the air. Her leather bra/top was tied tightly around the back and then sewn back around the front towards the center. Her bare feet hit the ground and the dust flew upward as she pulled herself into a ready stance as she pulled out two daggers and began to pratice twirling them very quickly. The pack of wolves sat and watched her carefully in awe. Some of the younger pups had already fallen asleep. Scythe had of course been off causing trouble a few nights before and was &quot;grounded&quot; to the hut for the time being. Aly quickly flung the daggers forward and they struck an outlined tree perfectly. She sighed and walked over to retreive them.::<br>
<br>
I wonder how Wulf is doing with Dawn in his training.<br>
<br>
::She knew that the training was in order but she herself was in remembrance of her own training as a young amazon. She must have hit herself in the head with that staff a thousand times. And if she had a dinar for every time she tripped on her chobos and landed on her face, she could buy Rome. She chuckled knowing what Wulf must be going through. As she pulled out her daggers, she heard a small noise. dropping the daggers and pulling out her staff she turned around and saw Hippolyte walking out of her hut. She smiled and decided to leave the Queen in peace. She placed her staff against a tree and then sat down in the center of the village. Closing her eyes she began to smile remembering Themiscrya from when she was little. Bringing herself into a meditational state, she began to close and open her hands in a yoga type orderly fashion while mumbling some Scythian Shamaness words. As she opened her eyes and looked skyward, she saw four stars shining brightly above her. She then looked downward where the same pattern of starlike symbols were tattooed on her left thigh. One of the tattooes however had been turned into a scar after Aly had cut it off with a ceremonial dagger. She looked up towards the similar star above her and sighed remembering the words of the Atmah.::<br>
<br>
I can't keep blaming myself for Alexa. She was not blessed to be born. All I can hope is that she is well.<br>
<br>
::She smiled then thinking of Aliya, Cora and Wulf. How proud she had been of all of them. Cora had been blessed an amazon Princess as Aly had hoped. Aliya was doing well in her Oracle studies, and Wulf had begun amazon training. Amazon Training. She thought. For all she had known, no male child had ever gone through such. And if any of them had, the only one who she knew of would be Theseus, even if he was old enough to endure such a task.::<br>
<br>
Cyane, bless my son that he will make us all proud.<br>

The long dagger in her left hand was poised to strike:: &quot;At what?!&quot; She told herself off aloud. There was nothing out here. No game to hunt, no lurking beast. She could tell if there was. ::She felt a great uneasiness sweep through her, making her spine tingle ever so slightly:: ::She stepped through the wooded area to a clearing. It had a small fringe of young trees surrounding it and a small, muddy pond. She sat at the bank, and picked up a stone. Staring at the dull greyness of the stone on the moonlight, she sighed.:: &quot;Why am I here?&quot; she called to the vacant sky, not expecting any sort of answer. She knew she wasn't one of the &quot;blessed&quot; ones that the Atmah would speak to. ::She drove her dagger into the ground and pried at the dry soil.:: &quot;Oh, well,&quot; ::She looked around, a resigned look on her face and sudenly feeling incredibly weary:: &quot;It's too late to get back to the village, i'll just sle--&quot; ::She cut herself off and lay her head on her wrists, staring at the moon:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=atmahcyane>Atmah Cyane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#993300>(11/5/00 4:49:39 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Night in the Village</span><hr size=1> Cyane had been watching over Alysia the whole time. With constant gazes to Wulf she was proud his training had begun. Of course she would watch over the lad, he was her blood and part of her as well Alysia. As well as all the amazons. She then heard her name, in thought or voice she knew not, but she knew she heard it.<br>
<br>
She went into the depth of the forest and seeing that Rishkae might be in a stressful time, she knew that she needed to make an appearance. As she stood in fron of the young amazon, she herself looked no older nor younger than 20. She glanced down at Rishkae, then raised her eyes to the moon of which Rishkae was looking at.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is a beautiful masterpiece is it not?&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled at Rishake as she accidentally scared the young amazon.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rishkae, why do you think that you are not blessed?&quot; <br>

<br>
&quot;Rishkae, you have yet to learn much in the amazon Nation. Especially with the Scynthians.&quot;<br>
<br>
She stood before her with a soft smile on her face.<br>
<br>
&quot;You see, I do not believe myself to be a God of somesort. Many of the amazons do. But I was jsut a girl, who got lost near the tretmolec lands. Yes I rode a wild horse, but to me I was still just a girl. But Samsara taught me that every amazon is important and no one is just a girl. That is why I comfort all of my daughters in their times of need. The reason I have been speaking to Alysia and Hippolyte often, is because of the man child Wulf. If you have ever doubted in your mind about the prophesies Rishkae, I am telling you now. Wulf is the Amazon Glory. He needs to fulfill his destiny. As one day you shall fulfill yours.&quot;<br>
