As soon as stepped out of the space rift, he knew something was wrong.  Could it be?  Could the Tree actually be crying?  That would be impossible, but Hermes definitely did feel a sense of immense sadness.  <br>
<br>
Wary, and fully alert, Hermes slowly walked up the trail that led to the base of the Tree.  Something was definitely wrong.  The Tree Hag should have already made her appearance.  No once could approach the Tree without first encountering its guardian.<br>
<br>
Hermes now more scared than ever, quickly scanned the area.  Nothing.  No sign of her at all.  As he was about to turn around and head to another part of the Tree, he noticed a scorch mark upon the grass.  Inspecting closer, he realized there were actually quite a lot of them.  It looked like tiny hoof marks, in fact hundreds of them, all running in varying directions.  <br>
<br>
What could they be?  And as Hermes pondered, something large dropped down from above.<br>

The sun, shone boldy upon his angelic face. He looked down from his tower down at the people of Alexandria. They were at the moment finishing a temple to him, and his sister Artemis. They would call it &quot;The Temple of Divine Twins&quot;. He laughed. His Egyptian clothing hung lose against his sculpted frame.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lord Apollo, your altar is ready.&quot; Tepshet said bowing and slipping into the darkness. He nodded to himself and walked through the temple to a large altar used for making prophecies. He sat down, picking up the Prophet herbs and rubbed them across his nose, inhaling deeply. Insense burned in the background. Apollo steadied his train of thought and closed his eyes. In a flash he was somewhere else.<br>
<br>
******<br>
<br>
Mortals ran mindlessly though the streets. Mothers abandoning daughters, father their sons. The sky seemed to bleed, the clouds float black the sky rain blood. There was light, but there was no sun. Yet there was a sun and a moon, who chased each other insanely through the sky.<br>
<br>
The sea, foamed and bubbled crashing against the rocks of Africa. Against the cliffs of Ithica. Tidal waves over came whole towns. Athens itself was under the boiling sea. Apollo saw his uncle Poseidon struggling to calm the oceans to no avail.<br>
<br>
Purple and midnight blue smoke whipped through the empty air. Loud moans, the moans of restless souls, lost souls, storming through the Underworld. Tartarus itself was crumbling upon itself. The river Styx overflowed onto its shores. Loud banging, very loud. As souls banged on the doors of Hades palace. He held the doors himself trying to stop the souls. No use, the souls banged down the doors, trampling Hades and pushing around Persephone who screamed Hades name in vain.<br>
<br>
His very sister Artemis, runs through the forest, all the animals who once loved her, chasing her, their eyes cold and lifeless. The trees uprooted themselves falling in her path. Bushes shed their berries, and rocks shattered.<br>
<br>
Dionysus gasped for air as the grape vine wound tighter around his throat. The grip kept growing tighter as the forest itself seemed to be attacking him. The wolves ran up and started to nibble at his flesh, the panthers too, clawed at his skin.<br>
<br>
Zeus, sat upon his throne howling commands at the gods. Hera stood next to him, crying. Zeus hurled his thunderbolts at the beasts and enemies that scaled Olympus. Then there he stood, an entity of so much evil, it shook Apollo in his seat, who was already seizing, his priests trying to help him. The entity was dressed in all black, his face unseen. Zeus and the entity began to grapple, fighting each other. Zeus was out weighted, and was beat with a blow to the back of the head.<br>
<br>
The entity laughed holding the universe in his palm. He stood out in no where, creating around him a universe of chaos. He continued to laugh as he began to crush the universe. And that was it, the once proud Zeus would inevitabally fall, and the evil entity would rule all!<br>
********<br>

Apollo snapped out of his tranze and dismissed the priests.<br>

He stared out the window next to him looking for inspiration as he often does from the forest sorrounding Thebes , but this time something differant arose.<br>
 <br>
Being a God of revelry he could feel in his gut mortal and divine feelings of anguish and terror for that is how he new when to make people happy threw these feelings. But this time he felt it ten tmes worse then ever. It was coming from up North and he wondered is His Norse friends were alright but the thought was dismissed after he realized his own safety may be in jeopardy. <br>
<br>
After putting down his quill pen he walked towards the window his arms behinds his back the two temple gaurds stood strongly on either side of him. He Stared out the window facing Northward almost seeing a black cloud in the distance. He thought to himself to pay a visit to his brother Hermes but first he should rally up troops.<br>
<br>
In a large effort with his advisors he made a large army situates in Thebes and now was the time he though to visit his brother before he is to late to help. Thats when he disappeared , Appearing beside Hermes.<br>

The thing that had lept down from above instantly enveloped Hermes upon contact.  The god fell to the ground as the entity tried to suffocate him by entering through nose and mouth.<br>
<br>
::This is crazy.  I can't be injured from suffocation.  I don't even need to breathe!  But I am about to black out.  I've got to do something fast.<br>
<br>
Within the gelatinous mass, Hermes transformed himself into an odd form comprised of massive spikes.  Yet the gel entity still Hermes fast.  And so Hermes desperate, began to swell in mass.  Inch by inch, volume upon volume, Hermes enlarged himself.  It was very hard to do, for the gel increased its contraction upon the godling.<br>
<br>
But something was happening, the gel had turned from a maroon red to a hazy orange.  And slowly, the spikes began to poke through.  As soon as one spike had punctured the gel, Hermes immediately turned himself into a hot spray, and quickly shot out of the creature.<br>
<br>
Shifting back into his humanoid form, Hermes began gasping for breath.  But the gel wasted no time in pressing on in the attack.  It suddenly became a flying scimitar, weaving and slicing through the air, as if it was being swung by an invisible arms-master.<br>
<br>
Hermes was too tired from before.  Somehow this creature had managed to sap a large quanitity of Hermes immortal stamina.  So all that the messenger of the gods could do was dodge.  He ducked underneath a decapitating swing, and lunged to the left.  He knew without looking that the blade would not be far behind.  <br>
<br>
::I've got to try something quick.  There's no way I can keep this up for long.  <br>
<br>
And suddenly it dawned on him.  He was in the realm of the Tree of Time.  Therefore why not let the Tree handle this.<br>
<br>
And so Hermes maneuvered himself until he was standing right in front of tree, and facing the oncoming blade.  At the least possible moment, Hermes somersalted over the scimitar and landed safely away.  But the blade, being carried by its momentum, kept going forward.  And suddenly it had stabbed the Tree and become enbeded.<br>
<br>
The Tree is a sentient being, although immobile, it carried within it a vast storage of knowledge and power.  It was already grieving for its lost guardian and companion, and so the Tree wasted no time in seeking revenge.  <br>
<br>
The blade tried desperately to release itself, but the sap from the Tree, caused from the stab wound, had already seeped onto the scimitar.  As more and more clung to the blade, the blade tried all the harder to free itself.  With deseperation, the blade changed back into its native form; a creature with three miniscule horns, a pig snout, and auburn fur all over its body.  It's left arm was stuck in the tree, and was already covered by sap.  <br>
<br>
The demon was desperate and suddenly it changed its right arm into another blade.  Realizing what was about to happen, Hermes shot out a blast of intense cold upon the creature.  Now with its right arm frozen, and its left arm immoblized, the demon's fate was sealed.<br>
<br>
Hermes cracked an evil smile.  ::There's no way you can escape now, so struggling is futile.  But you might as well keep trying.  The Tree is going to take its own sweet time in enveloping and digesting you.  And I am guessing that you probable had something to do with the Tree Hag's disappearance, I'm sure you're going to feel every painful moment.  And since I have your undivided attention, there are a couple of questions I would like you to answer. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=madmartigan>Madmartigan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(7/2/01 5:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=92.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.planetkilmer.com/valbum/wil-13.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Tavern songs</span><hr size=1> ::Madmartigan leads the way to his favorite tavern in waygarth, the Green Dragon.
