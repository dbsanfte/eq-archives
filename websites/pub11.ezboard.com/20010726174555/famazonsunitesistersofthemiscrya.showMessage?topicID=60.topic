Cyane appeared behind Alti and at hearing the words &quot;I am the great blah blah blah&quot; Cyane growled. *Think Again Alti*<br>
Cyane smirked and as Alti turned to face Cyane, Alti was backhanded into a tree. &quot;Don't mess with me Cyane, you are out of your league&quot; Alti spoke with a growl. *Wrong Alti, you're messing with my prophesies and my family. My Amazons!* She yelled and held her hand outward to Alti sending all the pain she had caused Ara to hit Alti right in the neck. *Now you welcome to my world.* Alti tried to loosen the grip that Cyane had on her neck but she could not. The only thing she was able to do was try, and try she failed. Cyane went to Ara's side immediatly, Ara being the first live amazon to feel the Atmah's actual pressence of flesh and bone. *Ara wake my child. Aly has sent me to help you. Your place in my Nation is not to die here. You have a destiny, to save my Wulf form the hands of Alti. I cannot stand in the way of her defeat, but I can assist you Arahuta.* As Cyane took the pain from Ara's body, she helped the Shamaness up and took the grip off of Alti's neck dropping her to the ground hard. *Go now Ara, make the amazons proud* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uarahutajiwarli.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arahuta Jiwarli</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.hometown.aol.com/arahutajiwarli/star-14.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Shamaness</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#993300>(10/24/00 12:04:52 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.facelink.com/arahutajiwarli?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Not to my daughters. . .. </span><hr size=1> :::Ara stood in awe of the Atmah and then looked to Alti upon the ground.

Arahuta's eyes looked deep into Alti and suddenly the ground began to rumble around all of them.  Alti stood up, looked at the ground and then to Arahuta. &quot;What a cheap magicians trick!&quot;  As the ground rumbled the sky turned dark as a sudden night fell.

But, I had an incredible vision quest.  I met and fought a woman named Alti.  She wanted my soul and she wanted the baby.  And then there was this Atmah Cyane, she helped me defeat Alti.  Who is this Alti?  :::Then she looked around and saw she was in a temple.  Ara looked down at the feather and then back to Callisto and then Hippolyte. Suddenly, she hears the voice of Atmah Cyane.  She listens to her words and hopes that she can do as the Atmah wishes::: <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uarahutajiwarli.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arahuta Jiwarli</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.hometown.aol.com/arahutajiwarli/star-14.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10> at: 10/24/00 5:01:05 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://hometown.aol.com/queenhippolyte/spinningsword.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Vasilissa</span><br>  Posts: 121<br> <font color=#993300>(10/25/00 11:52:57 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://facelink.com/Hippolyte?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The fight for a soul in Hera's Temple won</span><hr size=1> :::Hipp listened to Arahuta and frowned.:: Well, first lets get out of here and back over to the tavern.  And I will attempt to tell you the story of Alti.  :::The small Queen helps Arahuta up and nods to Callisto to follow.  As they pass the thru the door of the temple, Hipp smiles and releases the guards from their duites.  They walk back thru the village streets to the tavern... Hipp trying to explain what she knew of Alti.::: Well, Ara... I have never met this Alti.  She was a great and powerful shaman of the Nothern Tribes.   But, the story I was told ...was something about how she wanted to take over and rule the Amazon Tribes.  She tried to use Xena somehow :::Hipp stops talking and thinks, and they come upon the tavern. Hipp smirks and shrugs:::  I know there is more to the story.  You might ask one of the nothern Amazons.  I just know that she still haunts the amazons.  And you just had to fight her.  This was not the first time...:::Hipp stops and looks to Arahuta::: ....that she has tried to take over a body for evil purposes.  It seems that this infant of Alysia's is in a lot of danger.  We shall have to do whatever we can to keep him from harm.  :::Hipp smiles softly to Ara::: And you have just proven your worth in the tribe more than you can know.  May Hera and your Yhi bless you.  :::Hipp enters the tavern::: <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>
