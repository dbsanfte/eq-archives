~Sisters of Themiscrya,<br>
       My tribe has gone to war against an evil known as the Saurians. They have attacked children attending XenaVerse High, they have attempted to conquer our Allies in Rome, they also have been killing the Ancient Tribe of the Odusians, Amazon Children of the Ancients. I seek assistance from my fellow sister tribes. This is a battle that will not be easilly won. Currently, they keep Eli of the Elisians captive, but I do not know how long they will allow him to live. Only come if you know you can be of service, I will not be responsible for the deaths of my athelfi. This is a greater enemy than the Centaurs ever could be. Come if you can to Scynthia.~<br>

<br>
 As suddenly as a bolt of lightning would flash, Delilah was so suddenly hit with the force of a flood of news from that of the ancients that it sent her flying across the fire and hitting the tree that was where a spear had hit.<br>
<br>
The music stopped abruptly as the younger amazons rushed over to see what the matter was, but she groaned and told them to leave to their huts at once with a wince. She pulled herself to her feet, her mind with a new thought as she read the scroll that was attached to the tree by the spear. Her eyes closed and she walked away from it, to her hut to prepare in help to Alysia.. the bonfire would extinguish itself within the hour and she would be off to Scynthia to help a fellow amazon.<br>
<br>
As she headed to the hut, she saw the amazons still there and kindly asked them to play a couple rounds of awakening music to welcome the dawn and thena few rounds of music for the awareness within the amazons to arise as well, and then she headed into her hut and closed the door as those few amazons headed back to the bonfire to play again after giving a glance to the scroll on the tree.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 434<br> <font color=#993300>(8/17/01 3:14:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=271.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Amazons Unite</span><hr size=1> After hearing the news, Hippolyte had gone inside her hut and prepared for the war.  Her face grim, as more lines claimed her face.  <br>
Out from behind the curtains that covered her door..she appeared.  And quickly moved to the center of the village, grabbing the reigns of her mare that had waited outside.  Hippolyte was dressed in full war leathers, her Queen's mask capped on top of her head.  Her brown eyes danced over the faces of those who had taken notice as she took the dais.<br>
<br>
&quot;Amazons!  Our athelfi in Scynthia are begin attacked.  We must quickly ride and unite with them in a strength unmatched by any.  Prepare yourselves and quickly follow me to Scynthia.&quot; Hippolyte then jumped of the dais and onto the back of her mare...pulling the reigns tightly to the side...turning the steed to the side. <br>
<br>
Hippolyte sat on her mare, awaiting those who would follow.  Her gut wanting to rush out of Themiscrya at the moment...but her wisdom...telling her to wait. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamazondelerium.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amazon DeLerium</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#993300>(8/17/01 3:24:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=271.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/deleriuml9/images/del2.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Amazons Unite</span><hr size=1> ~ DeL ran quickly into her hut almost bumping into the Amazon children, one there she quickly dressed and grabbed her wolf warmask, she put it on, and pulled it up so her face would be revealed.

She was donned in tan leather pants except one leg of it went all the way down and the other leg was ripped off so it was like half pants\half shorts. She also wore a matching top that was covered in nature-color beads of deep purples, greens, browns and tans. The beads were sewn tightly to the leather to keep them from causing noise. On her face she wore her amazonian mask.  <br>
<br>
Around her exposed thigh she had a dagger within it's sheath strapped to it and around her calf she had a dagger/sword within it's sheath as well. She wore what looked like heavy-sewn leather moccasins so that any steps she made in the future were silent. <br>
<br>
Strapped down the outer side of her covered thigh was what looked like little throwing darts, each was covered in a poison concoction of curare which acted as a muscle relaxant, causing eventual collapse of the muscles, crushing the heart and lungs and stopping them from working with a final result of death.  Strapped to her back was a sword given to her by a prince in India for her assistance in the elimation of a demon who fed on and raped the daughters of an indian village. And on her fingers, she wore a ten-set of rings. Each ring had a small, sharp blade that could easily cause damage to reptillian skin. She could add poison to the tips of these if she wanted too. And under the rings she wore black, rough leather gloves that gave her the advantage of a good grip.<br>
<br>
She was fully assorted and she had her powers as well, but her first resource would be her weapons at hand, not in hand.<br>
She walked with a strengthful stride to the edge of the village and suddenly shot up her hand in the air, and even through the glove she wore, a red light shot out of her palm and up into the sky.<br>
<br>
A sudden rumble in the distance caused the ground to shake for a moment before what was approaching bounded high above a large stretch of trees and landed paces away from her, giving one strong tremble to the ground.<br>
<br>
She closed her palm and looked upon one really LARGE tiger. It was white with black spots, easily visible through any forest, but this one could also camouflage. She gave the tiger a smile and it knelt down to let her on. It was the fair size of a good, strong horse and as he got on it, it purred a very rumbling purr. She treated it pretty much like a horse too, a horse that could eat meat and had fangs and claws.  She clicked her tongue and the tiger set out at a galloping-typed pace towards Delilah's willed destination to assist Alysia.<br>

A woman who had quietly returned to those who had given her a home.  Hippolyte had met with Arahuta before she rode off with her small army of amazons.  She had made Ara promise to stay and watch over Themiscrya and those who remained.   Arahuta made the promise, and knew it meant she may have to break one she had made to herself.  That was to never kill.   She looked over the city of amazons and sighed.  And turned and walked to the smithy's barn.  There Hippolyte told her to chose any weapons.  Something that she would feel comfortable with and ready.  There were still warriors left in the city.  And they would stand with Ara in case of attack.  <br>
<br>
Ara stepped into the smithy and looked over the weapons.  Two slender long curved swords caught her eyes.  She had fought with the very same type in Rome as a slave.  Arahuta walked over and slide them from their places in the wooden wall then stepped back.  Instantly, like an old habit unable to be rid of, she began to move and twist with the swords in hand.  Fighting off the invisible enemy.  Then with a nod, she knew she was ready.  <br>
<br>
Arahuta went to her hut and fashioned two scabbards for the long thin blades.   Once finished she walked out of her hut and sat on the steps.  Listening for the call of the cities gaurdians, for anything. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualcippe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alcippe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#993300>(8/21/01 6:16:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=271.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Following</span><hr size=1> She sat unsure, watching her queen and listening to her words.

Her first war...Her time is come to defend the Amazon lands like her mother did before her.Daphnike isn't well liked through the Northern Lands but she feels as her duty to defend every sister from everywhere.Maybe she could gain Dawn's respect, it wasn't the reason of her participation in the war but she wanted to have a better relationship with her Northern sisters.And whatever they think of her, she'll defend them, like her sisters of Themiscrya.It would be her first war, lived in the heart of action.Now, she is an Amazon warrior, like Mytilene was.She wore her riding leather clothes and Amazon war mask, the feathers mixing up with her waistlength black hair, she looks like a character of myth, half woman, half bird.She carries with pride the sword that belonged to her mother and remember the words Mytilene told her long before, never fight with a dark heart.Daphnike knows that she'll have to kill to defend her sisters but she'll fight with honor,not as a cold hearted murderor.If she will have to kill, it will be for protection, by necessity and not by vengeance and the young warrior is conscious that vengeance is easy but is the gateway to the Dark Path. * <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya>Sisters of Themiscrya</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
