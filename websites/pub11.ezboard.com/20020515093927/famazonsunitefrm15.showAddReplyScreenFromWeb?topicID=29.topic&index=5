She didn't say anything at all because she knew she'd end up tripping over her words, either pissing off this goddess, or sounding stupid. Either one was not an option she was going to exercise.

She ran outside and emptied the contents of her stomach into the bushes, then fell to her knees and buried her face in her hands, not believing the sh** she was going through right now. How on earth could this have happened? Ancient Greece? Amazons? Goddesses? Little fat boys in taverns? At home you couldn't enter a bar unless you were 21. Things were so different here, she didn't know if she would ever get used to it.<br>

Kayce started sweating and hyperventilating as she thought about the possibility that she might never be able to go back home. <p><html> <center> <font face="lucida blackletter" size="+1"> ~ Kayce Cyane Ryder ~ </font> </center> </html></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uautumndeluxe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Autumn Deluxe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#939393>(1/25/02 10:06:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Little fat boy</span><hr size=1> Autumn looks at Cartman again and raised a brow.
