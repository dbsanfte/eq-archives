<br>
Infact it didn't seem to take long at all.As Bellerophon soars threw the sky,the sky is suddenly darkened.Looking up,he sees a large ledge hanging over a mountain side,which blocked out the rays of the sun once Bellerophon and Pegasus came to that point.Instantly,Bellerophon knew he had found the Chimera's dweling.<br>
<br>
With a slight tug of Pegasus' reigns to the right,They turn directions,and soar up and around the mountain side,to come up behind the beast.....<br>

Bellerophon slips his left hand into the leather handle on the back of the shield.&quot;Now Pegasus,you know what to do.&quot;And Pegasus did.The winged horse climbs higher into the air until reaching the top of the mountain side.Bellerophons eyes search the area quickly as Pegasus glides through the air,and toward the ledge..... <p>-=¤ Bellerophon ¤=-</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/umobellerophon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MO Bellerophon</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(8/27/01 8:54:45 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/alteredsoulsx/images/bellerophon-05.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Chimera</span><hr size=1> Just as Bellerophon and Pegasus near the ledge,the three headed beast shows it's self,yet not yet seeing Bellerophon and Pegasus,the gastly creature clumps to the ledge,snorting,hissing and grunting.The tail end,the snake end! of the Chimera slithers about the back of the beast.The goat end bleating annoyably and the lion end grunting as they over look the ledge.One could almost see the stench rising from the three headed beast.<br>

<br>
The Chimera while waiting to gather enough energy for another blast of fire,charges Pegasus and Bellerophon.Leaping toward the hero and his mount,claws are slashed about,and the goat head is desperatly trying to ram its head into Pegasus before the winged horse can renew it's advances.But before the beast could make any contact,Pegasus does renew it's advances,and quickly evades the attack,swooping up into the air,above Chimera,whilst the snake end of the creature is snapping its head out trying to sinks it's deadly fangs into one of Pegasus legs.Bellerophon having a firm hold onto Pegaus with his legs,swings the blade of the spear down,and slicing the head of the snake clean off.The Chimera bleats and roars as it feels the pain of one of its three heads being lopped off.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://hometown.aol.com/alteredsoulsx/images/peg-bel-1.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Now the Chimera was mad,and it rears itselt up,claws desperatly slashing at the air trying to bring down the Pegasus and it's rider,but Pegasus is to high in the air for the beast to reach it.Now the Chimera thuds back to all fours,heads raised,the goat head bleating up at the attackers while the lions head inhales heavily,and before it could manage to exhale the second blast of fire,Bellerophon raises his left arm up,bringing the shield up over his head,then with mighty strength he brings his arm back down,releasing the shield as he does this,the shield now comes down harshly upon the lion head,knocking it senceless before it could exhale that flame.<br>
<br>
While the Chimera is knocked senceless and trying to regain itself,Pegasus swoops down.Bellerophon grasping the spear with both hands.As Pegasus swoops down toward the Chimera,Bellerophon brings the spear back,and as they come mear feet from the beast,he thrusts it outward.The blade then peirces through the Chimeras rough hide,and penatrates it's heart.<br>
<br>
The Chimera groans in pain,staggering,it's eyes go pale and it falls to it's side,dead.Bellerophon,pulls back on the spear,pulling it from the creatures corpse.Pegasus then lands a few feet from the Chimera's lifeless body.Breathing a little heavily,Bellerophon stabs the spear into the ground,and just sits on Pegasus for the moment to rest,looking at the dead creature.<br>
<br>
One more strike on the Heroes list of Conqoured. <br>
