&quot;Until I see you again, Sheyala...&quot;<br>

::With that she stepped through the portal fully. Veyriean looks to Shey and sighs::<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Against my better judgement, I will go with her. I hope you do not worry for her, she has always been one to face things alone and Halon is nothing new to her. If it makes you feel any better, she will most likely face off with an enemy from long ago named Dekim.((^_^;I couldn't think of the original name... it was from fifth grade, so you can see my dilemma. But a gundam name is good!)) He was the one who took the lives of her athelfi and Karathea. Farewell, Sheyala... Anya...&lt;&lt;<br>
