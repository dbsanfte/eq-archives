More importantly, the golden dragon which hung around her neck had now totally changed.  The Dragon had grown and ceased to be around Bia's neck but was now positioned on her shoulder.   It's eyes glowing fiercely a brilliant burning red.  From it's nostrils issued smoke and as it opened it's mouth a flicker of flame was clearly visible.<br>
<br>
The Golden Dragon was infact an insturment of Bia, perhaps akin to some terrible guard.  Having sensed  the Presence of Hypnos  (as well as his fear of being visible), the dragon was now ready to strike.<br>
<br>
Bia had by now located the hidden figure herself.  Her eyes too showed a fierce glow like a sun about to explode.  Yet she stroked the dragon and tried to calm it.<br>
In an effort to resolve this before it went further she communicated telepathically to Hypnos: <br>
<br>
&quot;I know not why hiding is preferable to being visible.  For the latter could only assure me and all here that your intentions are honourable.  The former, however, is uncertain and unsafe in my presence. Moreover, I assure you you have not known the like of me, nor I counsel you, should you wish this to go further,&quot; she looked towards Hypnos now, her eyes ablaze of fiery gold, adding, &quot;I must dispatch my duties in this regard.  For I am Goddess Bia, Goddess of Force and Power, Warrior and Guardian of Zeus. You may know I take my duties in all seriousness.  Either you must explain why you hide so, or I must act in my duties.  I prefer an adequate explanation, as this is a feast of happiness and I wish it to remain so.  But, I charge you now Hypnos, explain to me why, or become visible. Or I must act. These are your choices .&quot;  <br>
<br>
Her words were stern and authoritative, there was no malcontent in her, merely he obligation to those here present in her duty to Zeus and Hera.  Her glowing eyes, like two fierce fireballs, told Hypnos she was serious and his presence &quot;being invisible&quot; was an error he had power to correct............<br>

As he moved along the tiled flooring,a dark shadow enveloped him and followed him. His greyen orbs scanning over the rather large gathering of Gods.<br>
<br>
As he moved over to the tables where food and drink were waiting,it appeared as though he were floating. He took up a chalice of fine wine,and drank.<br>

<br>
&quot;He wishes to be at peace while invisible,&quot; she questioned herself,&quot; Me thinks if he truely wished to conduct private business, this is not the place or time to do so.  Moreover, getting &quot;mad&quot; with Bia would indeed be a mistake, for Bia (like her sister and brothers) were without equal, this is why Zeus had appointed them his Guardians.<br>
<br>
The Dragon on Bia's shoulder was still growing, albeit at a slower rate than before.  It too had calmed slightly, but was still carefully watching Hypnos, ready to pounce at the least indication.  It's eyes glowed a deeper more menacing fury of red fire and instead of smoke, licks of flame exuded from it's mouth and nostrils.<br>
<br>
Bia herself was also transforming,  Her huge stature becoming ever greater, the gold of her raiment assuming a darker colour and the fireballs which were eyes assuming a greater intensity.  She was indeed beginning to show herself the very Personification of Force and Power, which indeed she was.  However, this was a place to beware.  To remember the real purpose of this gathering of the gods and therefore to restrain her instinctive nature.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well, Hypnos,&quot; she said at length,&quot;I will allow you a few moments to get your answer from Athena.  But no more than a few moments. &quot; She arched an eyebrow to emphasise that she was indeed serious. &quot;But I also caution you this,&quot; she continued,&quot; be you not invisible in my presence again.  For I shall not shrink from taking that as proof of your insincerety.  If, however, you do not receive an answer from Athena presently,  I advise you to assume that she agrees this is not a place for such dalliances, nor for your cloaked demeener.  Rather, it is better, for your own answers, to be visible and to win respect again (though how you lost it I know not) by being clear therefore.&quot;<br>
<br>
With this Bia gave Hypnos a look of fierce warning.  Her words were wise, if he understood them he would shortly make his presence known to all, for this was indeed the only possible way in which he could win their respect and trust.  How could he not know that by being devious as he was, he was incurring his own dishonour among them.  For indeed, all present were Gods.  All were capable of &quot;knowing&quot; as she knew.  She hoped, for his sake, he understood the wisdom of this. For if not, and if he did not respect her counsel in this matter, it would not, it could not, pass without notice or account being payed.......<br>
<br>
She moved a little way off from where he stood.  Her transformation unabated.  The Dragon now stood beside her it's menacing ferocity a clear signal that it was alert and prepared to do what might be necessary.  As indeed was Bia.  But she would allow Hypnos a curtesy he was not showing all else here.  She would restrain herself for a few moments as she had promised.................<br>
<br>
She noted the darkness and the being which emmerged from it.  She gave a slow nod of acknowledgement and returned to what occupied her, though also observing the new visitor amongst them.............. <p>~ ~ Bia  Goddess of Force and Power: Warrior and Guardian of Zeus ~ ~

He pulls out a chair right next to her and takes a seat himself. The glittering dress Hecate wears catches his eyes and he stares at it in a moment of silence. Then Hecate speaks, taking him out of his daydream state. The god grins at her statement and laughs softly with his shoulders jumping up and down in his laughter. <br>
<br>
'So you have seen the tension in Athena huh? Yeah she has a grudge against me, anyways what happened is past and done. I don't know why she is still mad' he smirks, 'she's still a virgin.'<br>
<br>
Poseidon waves over a nearby cup-bearer who hands him a goblet and Poseidon takes it happily. 'Thank you' he addresses the youthful man. The drink is emptied quickly as it is thrown down the sea god's throat. He places the goblet on the table and looks again at that marvelous dress of Hecate. 'You know I must say you do look stunning Hecate.'<br>
<br>
He licks his lips and answers Hecates question about his wife. 'Yes you are right, Amphitrite would not be here because she is vacationing with her father. I've no idea when she'll return but she should be back by the time I return from meeting the Ethiopians.'<br>
<br>
'Have you taken a bite to eat or are you content?' he asks Hecate. 'I know I am starving and there is plenty to go around.' At his behest one of Hephaestus' magical tables rolls in carrying a tray of prepared food up to the table. Poseidon takes the dishes of the tray and sets them on the table. The dishes click on the hardness of the table and the scent of the food rises into his nostrils.<br>
<br>
'Mmm, looks good, are you up for some?' he trys to convince her. A cool breeze gently blows at the heat rising in the hall to another place away from Olympus. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugoddesseris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goddess Eris</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/chaoticdiscordxx/images/eris2.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 96<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(9/21/02 3:44:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=270.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/gates_of_olympus/dis_kno3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Chit chat</span><hr size=1> ~She walked around sampling the tasty tid bits on each table, smacking her lips with each bite.

<br>
&quot;Troubles have been amidst in your absense Father, I only hope that your return will assist me in bringing justice and rule here.&quot;<br>

It was then that she heard Hypnos' voice. She as well could overhear Bia's. She gave a smile to Bia and spoke telepathically with them both.<br>
<br>
~Hypnos, you are still under punishment as it were, your actions were held against you and shall be held against Hades if you are caught here by the Furies.

In a whirl of flames, blue, black and red. . .  the trio of terror appeared in the hall of Olympus.<br>
Alecto, Megaera and Tisiphone all grinned as they looked about with wild eyes at the Gods.<br>
<br>
Instantly they found their Mother Gaia and bowed in great respect of the Goddess. Alecto then spoke.<br>
&quot;Mother, your pressence brings honor to my eyes.&quot; She grinned.<br>
<br>
Megaera listened to Tisiphone's whispered words.<br>
&quot;We feel the same Mother.&quot;<br>
<br>
After the proper bows and such, each young Erinye wandered to where Zeus and Hera were. They gave their proper bows in respect and smirked lightly.<br>
Alecto once again spoke.<br>
&quot;His Highness returns in glory great Zeus.&quot; She smiled. &quot;Much has happened since you left us. Mortals and Immortals alike have been causing rifts in the balance of good and evil.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Furies knew much. They spoke with the Gods on many matters.<br>
Megaera grinned. &quot;But Justice works in many ways.&quot; She briefly thought of Hypnos, already feeling his pressence nearby. <br>
<br>
Tisiphone looked to Athena and then to Poseidon as he and Hecate passed. She knew a great deal of what had happened, although Athena had yet to tell Olympus of Poseidon and Hepheastus' violation. As far as most knew, Nike was the only other one with knowledge of that night. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugoddessbia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goddess Bia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1560252154.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(9/22/02 9:12:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=270.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.phoenixarises.com/wof/royo6.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hypnos and others</span><hr size=1> ~ Bia smiled and bowed slightly towards Athena.

Telepathically, she acknowledged Athena, ~ You are welcome my lady, I shall not see anyone present troubled by this one until he has again redeemed himself with the Gods. Know you can call on my assistance any time my lady, she concluded. ~<br>
<br>
She turned towards Hypnos once more and flashed huge golden orbes of intense light towards him.  As she did so, the Dragon, now standing as tall as she herself, glowered it's crimson fire towards him.  It's emmence form, as ~ Bia herself, towered over those present. It's golden form matching  Bia's in it's shimmering intensity. Their wings seemed like dancing fire in their outstretched form, lit as they were by the torches which lit the feast.<br>
<br>
~ Bia remained so,  watching Hypnos carefully, while Athena spoke to him.  Bia was about truth and justice. Here, as elsewhere, she would continue to do so.  Hypnos would be scrutinised until she was instructed otherwise and both she and her dragon would remain vigilant in this matter.<br>
<br>
It would indeed be well for Hypnos to note this and remember.  But it would also be right to see him redeem himself with the Gods if indeed he could do so. . . . . . <p>~ ~ Bia  Goddess of Force and Power: Warrior and Guardian of Zeus ~ ~

He liked the fire in Bia and had always been respectful of her power.  She was not on a beautiful guardian but loyal to him.  As the most powerful god on Olympus, even Zeus required guardians for there were those, his eyes glanced toward Poseidon, those who would seek to destroy him and claim his throne.  <br>
<br>
Listening to the wise words of his daughter, Athena, Zeus could not help but to beam with fatherly pride.  He quickly moved to greet Gaia as it was not in his nature to be disrespectful of the others.  He was a fair and just god and as such to disregard the greeting of one he held in such high esteem would be unheard of.  He greeted Gaia with a kiss up on the back of her hand.  &quot;As always it is a pleasure to see you, great goddess.&quot;  It was not long before the furies arrived in all the glory.  With a smile upon his lips, he greeted each of them equally and in turn.  &quot;What a pleasant surprise!  Surely these are the most glorious in all of the known world.&quot;  He poured on the charm as he greeted them.<br>
<br>
Zeus waited to speak with Athena as she handled her invisible guest.  He chuckled wondering why it was that a god such as Hypnos would appear invisible when most of those gathered had the power to discern his presence and would surely question his motives for not revealing himself. <br>

She first walked to Gaia respectivly and greeted her, talking for a few to THE Earth goddess, she then greeted the others, spyng her brother Poseidon in the corner with Hecate, she walked over and interupted. &quot;It has been a many moon since I have seen you dear brother of mine.&quot;  She bent over and placed a kiss upon his cheek then embraced him in a strong hug.

A brighter smile on her face. &quot;Dearest of my sisters, Queen of the Gods...&quot; She embraced her sister in a long hug, patting her back.  &quot; I havent been in your presence in a long long time. How goes it? Well I hope.&quot;  She looked over and noticed that Zeus was busy with Athena, she would greet her brother later. She then waved to the Furies and anyone else she missed. <p>:*: Goddess Demeter, Goddess of the Harvest.

&quot;My dear daughters, you bring me any honour and pride I have, how are my children fairing this day?&quot;<br>

When Zeus approached them, Alecto smiled in greeting and turned her eyes to Athena who told her with a glance to allow Hypnos to retrieve himself back to the Underworld for now. Alecto nodded and turned her attention back to Zeus.<br>

The sea god looks over and sees the male servant who dropped the dishes pick them up looking quite shaken. Eris seems to be responsible or more obviously likes what she sees as Poseidon espies her out giggling. <br>
<br>
Bia catches his eye of a sudden, that powerful goddess, as she seems to be concentrating on something, her mind away from the feast, Athena as well. This was happening for a little while and the god had a hunch as to what it may be. Hypnos! Sure Poseidon could sense him there, he was immortal and in the same hall. The god decides at that moment to leave him be, but at the same time another thought comes of personally escorting the unwanted guest out. However, he keeps to his place, but will not tolerate Hypnos if he even makes himself tangible.<br>
<br>
A shadow falls over him and as a soft body closes in on his Poseidon can tell immediately that it is his sister, former lover, Demeter by that sent of hers. The immortal god returns the kiss he recieves and smiles. &quot;Welcome Demeter! Do enjoy yourself and make well. All provisions needy of a feast are at your disposal. I'll join in the social events after a minute or two with Hecate here.&quot; He nods over in Hecates direction. The earth goddess walks off after a wink and Poseidon stares at her, the wonderful etrnally youthful body of hers only an immortal, a queen among immortals can possess.<br>
<br>
After Demeter leaves them alone once again Poseidon folds his hands under his chin and stares at Hecate while she speaks. &quot;Hungry for something else eh? I wonder what it is that you hunger for!&quot; Just then another guest comes over, the most hated God of all Olympus. Ares the war god who questions his lack of being a suitable host. Poseidon laughs it off and shakes Ares hand. &quot;Welcome Ares, excuse my not greeting you sooner, Hecate and I were here speaking for a minute. Though I do suppose it is time for me to entertain my guests as it seems I am needed.&quot;<br>
<br>
He rises and turns to Hecate. &quot;We can continue this later Hecate. I've got to greet my wonderfully thoughtful guests who have arrived and not been properly hosted.&quot; He winks at her in turn as Demeter had winked at him and leaves Ares and Hecate together at the table. Poseidon's plate almost finished of its food is still at the spot he sat at and is quickly cleared by youthful servants. The band is just finishing playing a tune when Poseidon tells them to play something more vibrant to uplift spirits. The chorus then starts singing the story of the Olympians triumph over the giants.<br>
<br>
The god walks away strutting in a Dionystic type revel manner and with an uplifted voice speaks to the crowd. &quot;The main course will soon be served everyone and do welcome our wonderful minstel's song of Olympian triumph.&quot; He claps for them as they play the song in its entirety cheering them on. <br>
<br>
Poseidon then heads over to Zeus and pats his huge arm. &quot;So bro what do you think of the festivities? I hope it's to your liking.&quot;<br>

However as Hypnos left, she relaxed very slightly and the two towering winged figures of glittering gold and shimmering light stood on watch over Lord Zeus, Lady Hera, Athena and the rest of those present.<br>
