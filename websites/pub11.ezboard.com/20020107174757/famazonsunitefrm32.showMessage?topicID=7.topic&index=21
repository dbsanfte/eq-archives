His form resting on top of the horse as he waits his hands tightening against the reins of the horse. To his right a new companion, a large brown grizzly, the monster was big enough to make a group of ten men tremble with fear.  It's body was atleast five feet tail maybe ten on it's hind legs it was a truly powerful animal.<br>
<br>
         His horses nostrils shooting jets of white streams into the air, on it's sides a quiver of spears holding at least ten deadly spears. He himself was covered in a strange collection of armor. His pants covered in a thick rawhide. His boots made over the same material but the shins covered with a thick metal sheet. His chest covered a strange armor of chains strapped together over his chest. The shiny metal was coated with black ash.<br>
<br>
          He was the only male on this side most likely, but against gods it mattered little. His wrist were covered with two different looking gauntlets one gold and the other silver. He had his mystical blade over his back the runes seemingly glowing with power. His was ready for this the tension in the air was electric and the immortal was ready to try his hand.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualastorofancients.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alastor of Ancients</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/14/01 5:04:39 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://caspervandien.net/sleepyhollow/themovie/photos/images/indeximageov.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Heh</span><hr size=1> (( that was me just forgot to switch a post thingy.. )) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 394<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/14/01 5:07:18 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..The Norseman..</span><hr size=1>  Dawn shifted some atop the saddle of her horse, feet fitting loosely and edgy into the stirrups. Although she looked nervous, and paranoid, inside she was focused. For yards, maybe miles, her ears could hear the shuffling of prepared feet, and the snorts of a rather angry horse. <br>
<br>
 Underneath the war mask, lips formed into a cynical grin. Even a hint of those defining emerald eyes showed underneath the layer of crimson that coated her eyes. It was hatred and blood lust, blood shed and killing, that covered the truth in her soul. <br>
<br>
 Hearing the snorts once more, Dawn glanced over her right shoulder, a brow raised at the presence of Alastor on their side. Logic tugged into her mind, everyone would think he was there to betray him, but the aura he gave off told otherwise. <br>
<br>
 A simple nod was given to the norseman, and his horse, before Dawn turned her head back to face forward. To face the gods. [I'm not honoring any NPC's.] There was.. let's see.. Hecate, Eris, Poseidon, Hypnos, and Fogstone. The assassin couldn't help but snicker, glancing to around at the amazons.<br>
<br>
 Yup, they were all the ego manics each one of them had proven to upset, because they couldn't get their way, outside of their cushy life, and spoiled world. But then, they had been the stupid ones to try and intimidate the amazons. <p>

He turn his reins slowly moving his horse towards the lead mount of Hippolyte. As he trotted the bear came next to his side padding along next to him.  As he walked he slowly uttered the ancient prayer of his people. <br>
<br>
  &quot;Lo, there do I see my father <br>
   Lo, there do I see my mother and my sisters&quot;<br>
<br>
         As he trotted he thought of past and present blended into one as he moved.  He moved along as his head turned slowly to look at the grizzly nest to him, he gave another nod.  He looked back ahead of himself as he leveled his eyes on Hippolyte. <br>
       <br>
&quot;and my brothers<br>
Lo, there do I see the line of my people back<br>
to the beginning&quot;<br>
<br>
         As he moved towards her his hand lingered down next to his saddle pulling a long spear the tip a strange black rock, brimstone. He moved his horse closer to hers as he picked up speed riding past Del.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lo, they do call to me<br>
They bid me take place among them<br>
in the Halls of Valhalla<br>
Where the brave may live forever...&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He matched her speed slowly up next to her as he looks over at Hippolyte spear in hand. His lips curl slightly as he nods over to her. His hair long once more like before to his mid-back his chin shaved clean. The demon of the battlefeild had returned.<br>

His face dark with the passion of war. In his right hand he held the sword of war which he swung with great ease. Walking to the centre he took the sword and smashed it deep into the ground, where there was a massive rumbling before he withdrew it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't tell me you decided to fight a war without the God of War, although I must admit I'm in a bit of a dither to which side I should be on. After all I am some of the Amazon's fathers, and my favourite assasin is there as well. But then they wouldn't want to me to fight with them beause they want to stand up for themselves and I don't blame them. Then of course there are my fellow gods, who have manipulated, tricked and decieved people for years...I'm really at a loss here!&quot;<br>
*He sits down on the battlefield*<br>
<br>
&quot;What a dilemna&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm not going to flip a coin...but I've decided which side I'm on...and I don't care if they don't want me to help...I for once don't care about worship etc...but when I have the chance to get back at some of my 'godly friends' plus also I don't think you should make people worship gods that they don't want to believe in or change their worship...its sounds a very strange thing for me to say...but hey! Its me...give me credit&quot;<br>
<br>
*hmmm...I guess it's settled...I fight with my daughters and the Amazons...Dad's so not going to like that* <p><HTML><BODY>
