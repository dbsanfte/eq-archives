Themiscrya didn't need her...not as much as she needed it.   And now she had given it up....out of shame.  Yet there was something that tugged at Hippolyte when she looked at her old hut from the distant forest.  It had become someone elses home.  Hipp clenched her fist around the saddle horn in front of her, as she let the mare slowely walk away from the Great City of Amazons.  Her father had sent her home...was it some kind of joke?  Hippolyte didn't know...and now as she let the mare wander...she didn't know what to do ..or where to go.  It was hard to shake something that was so innate...being a Vasilissa.  But, Solari and DeL were good Vasilissa's..she was sure of it.  She had made the right decision....or did she?  Hipp questioned herself.  Had it been just the winter mixing up her mind...and confusing her?  Was Eris playing games and Ares laughing?  Did her father pull her away to despite Hera?  Now even Hera didn't seem to look for her.  <br>
<br>
The mare stopped and Hippolyte looked up in front of her.  There was a woman huddled against a tree crying.  The amazon slid off her mare and walked up slowely.  Her small hand not far from her dagger.  &quot;Are you alright?&quot;<br>
<br>
The woman looked up at her.  Eyes in fear as she tried to stand up, but was unable to.  &quot;Please please...don't hurt me!&quot;  The woman cried.<br>
<br>
The woman was not amazon...no.  Her clothes were very simple in fashion.  But, not greek.  &quot;Don't worry.. I won't hurt you.&quot;  Hipp caustiously glanced around looking for any danger.  But, she saw none.  Then her brown eyes traveled back down to the woman.  &quot;I am Hippolyte....I want to help you.  Tell me who did this to you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My husband,&quot; the woman once again began to cry histerically.  <br>
<br>
Hippolyte's brow furrowed.  And then reached out to try and help the woman up.  &quot;Come...let's get you warm and something to eat.  I won't let anyone hurt you.&quot;<br>
<br>
The woman looked up thru tears for a bit and then slowely reached out..taking Hippolyte's hand.  Hipp smiled and gently helped the woman up, placing her arm underneath a bit to hold her up.  &quot;Let's get off the road first...these roads can be dangerous.&quot;  Slowely and carefully, she led the woman into the woods.  Her faithful mare following from behind. <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

As Hipp slowely fed the fire bits of kindling, she glanced over and smiled.  The woman was relaxing now, huddled up close to the fire.  <br>
<br>
Standing up slowely, Hippolyte walked over to her mare and pulled out two pieces of dried meat and cheese.  She walked over and knelt near the woman, offering a piece of each.  &quot;Would you like something to eat?&quot;<br>
<br>
The woman looked at her carefully and then took the food, &quot;Thank you.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Hipp moved a bit away from the woman and sat down on the cold ground.  Eating her own small bit of food, she watched as the woman ate.  <br>
<br>
&quot;What is your name?&quot;  Hipp asked.<br>
<br>
The woman looked over at the amazon ...and became quiet.  Then spoke, &quot;My name is Cassandra.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hipp smiled gently, &quot;A very nice name ...Cassandra.&quot;  Hipp's brown eyes darted to the fire and then back to the woman.  &quot;Can I ask why you ran from your village and husband?&quot;<br>
<br>
The woman stopped eating and almost suddenly began to tremble.  Hippolyte frowned and sighed.  She didn't mean to upset the woman.  &quot;I am sorry.&quot;<br>
<br>
The woman shook her head.  &quot;No..don't be.&quot;  Her eyes serious Cassandra looked into Hippolyte's dark eyes.  &quot;Where I come from...we are nothing more then animals it seems.   My husband has decided that he will have another wife...and my 12 year old sister at that.  I tried to tell him no...tried to get him to leave her alone.  But, he only beat me and sent me on my way.  I am afraid for my sister.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hipp's frown grew darker.  Her blood beginning to boil.  &quot;Does your sister want to stay in this village and with your husband?&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;She wants to stay home..yes..but..she is afraid of my husband.  And I am afraid for her.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me more about this village..and the  men there.&quot;  Hipp asked.<br>
<br>
Cassandra told Hippolyte about her village.  It was a new one...and had taken up residence between Troy and the Black Sea.  The men were renegades from the Roman army.  Men who had fought against their commanders and ended up beaten and kicked to the side.  They had taken some Trojan and Greek women...making them their own.  And built a new village.  Grumbly old ex military men...with no respect for women...or the land around them.   <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

Hipp had covered Cassandra in her saddle furs.  Curling her own self up next to the fire, Hippolyte couldn't sleep.  With so many emotions going on inside her...she wanted to take it out on someone..or something.   She was reared by Hera...and that fact was coming out.  Her blood had boiled to spill life from another.  With Gabby no longer at her side..there was no one to cool the older amazons emotions.  She was her old self again.  A wondering Vasilissa..with no home or tribe.  Of course, this time.. it had been at her own doing.  <br>
<br>
The dark blood in Hippolyte needed a sacrifice.  Something to focus on other then her own problems.  Looking up at the cold moon above them...Hippolyte knew the night was still young.  Slowely, she pushed herself from the ground.  Her mare looked up and snorted a bit at her.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Quiet Monsoon....stay here..guard Cassandra.&quot;  She asked the mare.  Who just gazed at her and then relaxed it's muscles into resting.  <br>
<br>
Hippolyte's hands slid over her body, checking for her weapons.  And then quietly left the camp in the direction Cassandra had told her. <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

She watched caustiously for any signs of life...the only ones seemed the animals.  Then there..she caught sight of them.  A large corral of horses.  They seemed to be the only ones that the villagers owned.  <br>
<br>
With a grin, Hippolyte carefully moved thru the village.  Hiding behind buildings and objects..until she was standing next to the corral.  A couple horses snorted, and Hippolyte raised her hand up slowely..offering her palm.  They looked at her warily..and then Hipp began to hum a soothing song.  An old trick from the one named &quot;the stampedin horse&quot;.  Sliding her small body thru the slats, Hippolyte was soon on the inside with the horses.  Her brown eyes danced over the herd until her eyes settled on one who looked like a trusted ride.  <br>
<br>
Hippolyte unlooped a leather strap from her belt and walked over to the horse.  Wrapping the strap around it's muzzle and neck.  Then she led it over to the gate.  Quietly, she unlocked the gate and pushed it open.  The horses looked at it caustiosly, lifting their heads up.  Hipp grinned and then jumped on the back of the one she had picked.  Sending out a loud Amazon yipping yell, she road the horse around the others.  Instantly, they bolted at the yelling and the scimitar that was suddenly raised in the air.  The metal from the blade flashing in the  moonlight. <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

Their whinnies echoing thru the small village.  Hippolye rode in the middle of them...screaming like a wild amazon banshee a large smile on her face.<br>
<br>
Villagers quickly ran out of their huts with weapons..yelling and spotting the herd...then the wild amazon.  <br>
<br>
Hippolyte rode around, her scimitar cutting down ropes and small wooden structures.  Riding around here and there...with the only seeming desire..to destroy.  <br>
<br>
The men ran for their horses, but the horses were soon out of sight and all was left was the crazy amazon.  Turning..they ran for Hippolyte.  And she met them..her scimitar meeting steel and flesh.<br>
<br>
Hippolyte saw in the distance a young girl..who fit the every description Cassandra gave her of her little sister.  Hippolyte pushed the horse towards the girl and thru the men.  Fighting them off.  They were incredible fighters...Hippolyte was finding soon it wasn't their skills that they were kicked out of the Roman Army for.  <br>
<br>
Finally.. making her way to the girl, she grabbed her and pulled her on the saddle.  Hipp quickly told the girl, &quot;Cassandra sent me to get you.&quot;  The girl got quiet at the mention of her sister's name.  Hippolyte held her tight and urged the horse to race out of the village.  The men were shouting behind her ..their weapons raised.  <br>
<br>
She knew they would not stop until they found the crazed amazon.  Hippolyte's mind whirled with a plan....as she rode the girl back to camp. <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

There she knew they would be safe.  Cassandra and Kara were frightened at first.  They had heard about the wild animals who lived in the woods.  Since they were girls they were told these animals eat men for food and steal the woman to sacrifice.  <br>
<br>
Of course, the stories were enchanting to Hippolyte.  She  knew very well how the stories had become to being....the amazons made great scary legends.  But, Hippolyte assured them they were safe.  Especially, as women...they had nothing to fear.  <br>
<br>
The women and the amazon built a small camp.  Settling in with making small lean to huts.  Kara and Cassandra were both impressed with Hippolyte's ideas and skills on building.  But, it was  nothing to Hippolyte.  She had helped rebuild most of Themiscrya twice.  The small structures were simple.  <br>
<br>
They settled in..making it their temperary home. All the while...Hipp's mind working on her plan for the neo village.  These men would learn to quickly respect the ...&quot;animals&quot; that come from the deep woods. <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

But, a Darkshade, never gave up hope. <br>
<br>
 That was how it had started, of course. In wolf form Dawn had felt the need of her Queen, the urge that her Queen.. her first Queen was in need of help, in need of strong amazons, assassins, warriors, women that could help those whom had always been the ones they vowed to save. In the woods Dawn had headed and with midnight black fur pressed into the scent and feel the forest creatures, she began tracking.<br>
<br>
 It had taken merely, hours, and the emotions and feelings of Hippolyte had become more apparent to the wolf, and she knew the camp site Hipp had chosen wasn't far off. But, finding it was always more easier than approaching it; Dawn felt the energy of the two freightened women, and an animal wandering into the camp site wouldn't be making things easier.<br>
<br>
 But with the arrival of another Themiscryan, Dawn took her chances of running into the Queen.<br>
<br>
 Simply as the sun began to set, the dark creature curled its body around trees, and closer and closer to the campfire. And once no one paid attention to the outer limits of said camp fire.. on forepaws of fur, the assassin crawled. <br>
<br>
 The next time anyone would look toward the crackling fire, they would see her. Settled gently on her haunches, the amber of the fire reflected against her midnight tones, and still clearly carrying trademark pools of emerald. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dawnithinia>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0> at: 2/15/03 6:44:49 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fireofthemiscrya>FireOfThemiscrya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#993300>(2/15/03 6:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm66.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Old Times and Old Ways resurface</span><hr size=1> Lysia could only grin, so glad was she to see Hippolyte again.  &quot;You know me...

The tall woman scuffed a boot in an almost adolescent gesture.  None too introspective, she'd simply known she had to follow Hippolyte.  It wasn't that her loyalty to the new vasilissas was any less, but she hadn't grown up under their rule.

Gently she reached up and brushed her fingertips along the warriors cheek.  Slowely she pushed a wild strand of soft light hair away and then pulled her hand back.  She remember the day when she did not look up at Lysia.  The younger wild amazon girl who trained so hard to impress the Queen.  &quot;And I thankful that you have arrived....&quot;  Hipp grinned and then walked back towards the hut.  &quot;As a matter of fact..I could use your help...there seems to be...&quot;<br>
<br>
As Hippolyte neared the hut, the site of a wolf caught her eyes.  It had been awhile since Hippolyte had been watched by a wolf.  When she was away at war with her father...it was only his loud hounds that she saw.  Hippolyte stopped and gazed for a moment at the wolf. There was something familiar about it. <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

Specifically a tiger.<br>
<br>
 The tiger carried the same demonic midnight black fur, and white stripes. Without a hesitiation at that moment, the tiger trotted to Hippolyte, parading between herself and the young guard. <br>
<br>
 Emeralds seemed to maintain a constant watch on everyone as it gave way its deep secret of who it was. Once Dawn felt she was satisfied, she pawed her way back to the fire. And once more settled upon haunches and stared at Hippolyte with a canted head.<br>
<br>
 She was here to help. It was simple. When Hippolyte had been interested in Gargarensia, Dawn had been there. When it came to assassination and the destruction of men, Dawn had always been there. It just took approval from her Queen. Always and forever Hippolyte would be Dawn's one true Amazon Queen.<br>
<br>
 The tiger watched. Continuing to maintain its connection to the amazon it saw before her; to the reigning legend who hadn't walked away. <br>
<br>
 Those emerald pools seemed to reach into Hippolyte, stirring up all of her memories of Dawn. All of the memories of the amazon who had walked away, but came back for her Queen. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dawnithinia>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0> at: 2/15/03 7:30:20 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fireofthemiscrya>FireOfThemiscrya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#993300>(2/15/03 7:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm66.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Old Times and Old Ways resurface</span><hr size=1> Lysia's mind seemed to misfire for a long moment.

 Emeralds fell upon the young one again, staring for what seemed to be an eternity, before Dawn decided it was okay to shift infront of her.<br>
