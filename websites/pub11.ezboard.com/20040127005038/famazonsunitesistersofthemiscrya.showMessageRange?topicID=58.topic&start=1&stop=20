 She chuckled lightly, having given birth 3 times before and also helped deliver she knew what Aly was going through. That was when she turned to Ara.<br>

&quot;Make sure you get thread and a needle, as well as a blanket for the baby when it is born. I've got a sterile dagger to cut the cord. You can't deliver with just towels and water. It doesn't work that way.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Off the table Dawn's form flipped to land next to the bar where her arms scooped a bottle of vodka, needle, thread and a blanket. Then over to Aly she made her way.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know Ara is suppose to help Aly, but she doesn't look much like she knows what she is doing.&quot;<br>

 Green eyes turned to look at Hipp, where she tossed the full bottle of vodka.<br>

 Dawn took a few moments to clean her hands, and then with her freshly made golden dagger, basically sterile, she began to open Aly's stomach, but not after the proper numbing..BARK. Dawn knew better than to use spells. She gently opened up Aly's stomach to see the tiny baby boy..her head shook lightly as she put her dagger down in Ara's hands.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um Aly....the cord is wrapped around his neck...&quot;<br>
<br>
 There was no other way for Dawn to explain it, she gently took the child from the womb(?), Dawn's hands gently unwrapped the cord from the child's neck. Each movement she held him closer until the cord was gone from its neck, and Dawn's hand supported his neck. Then the dagger cut the the cord and a happy WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA was heard through the silen Tavern. Dawn smiled handing the child to Ara. Her hands quickly worked to sew Aly's stomach shut. Once done she spoke again.<br>

She had watched the man enter, draw his sword, and speak. Each movement had angered Dawn, which caused a loud roar to erupt from her mouth. It sounded as though it came from Hades himself, it emitted from only her throat, but what strong tiger wouldn't roar like she did. Dawn moved to grab her sword but it wasn't at her side, causing her to realize it was by Aly. With a few jumps as she ran, she flipped quickly ontop of a table, and continued her running toward the couch, she rolled off of a table, and grabbed her sword, and backflipped off of the back of the couch to land just behind the Roman fool. She spin jumped into the air, her foot knocking the man to the side and into the table next to him as she came down.<br>
<br>
 &quot;You fool. You think you can come into THIS TAVERN..and kill my rite of caste, and her child. Not a good move. I hate men and I surely hate Roman men. You need to back off.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn stood in a strong attack stance, her green eyes had quickly changed to red in the threat of a fight. Andrenline pulsed through her veins as she growled again, growing more angery and more fierce with the moment. She watched as the man stood to look at her...the sight of the weary and weak soldier made her chuckle maniacally. <br>
<br>
 &quot;Weak.&quot;<br>
<br>
 That was the last word Dawn spoke as she sprung forward, her sword slicing across his chest as her foot met with his groin to push him against the wall. Dawn quickly dropped her sword, as the daggers around her wrist were flipped to face him, then thrusted into his shoulders, were Dawn twisted them deeper until they met with the bone. Her eyes grew happy as well as her lips as he cried out in pain.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I always knew Romans were the most fun to kill.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Yes, Dawn was cold blooded, what would you expect from an Assassin of her stature. She slowly retwisted the daggers, causing them to unscrew from the bone and pull from his flesh, ripping muscles and ligiments more as they came out. The daggers made the wound so much worse than it would have been if just thrusted. She smiled as she stabbed the same bloody daggers into his stomach, where they were left. Bloody hands felt warm and at home with her fighting spirit.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Weak Romans, such a threat. NOT&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn sounded like a kid again, as her hands held against the strangers shoulders, and thumbs gently pushed into the shoulder wounds, and dug dangerously around, pushing and tearing at anything they felt, then they made it to the bone, were Dawn pushed up with her knee on the man's crotch area, sliding him up the wall and her thumbs and arms pushed down into the wound, breaking the bones. It caused a sickening crack to roar through the Tavern. Then without notice Dawn pulled away from the man, she flipped forward onto a table and then turned, and kicked him across the face.<br>
<br>
 &quot;You can tell your Roman friends, to never entire this Tavern again...oh wait..you won't live that long!&quot;<br>
<br>
 She cackled softly, unsheathing another two daggers from around elven boots. Dawn sat casually on the table and sent the daggers sailing into the man's thighs. Another painful howl filled the ears of the people in the Tavern.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Does it hurt? Cause I'm enjoying it.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn stood once again, grabbing the man by the throat, throwing him across the Tavern into the sturdy bar. Where she walked to face him, she just stood there, watching the man in pain, watching him die. He was minutes away.<br>

<br>
 &quot;The word is getting out. This Child is to bring glory, we are Amazons hated by the Romans. Are they really going to want to see us in glory? No. They are going to do everything they can to kill you or your child. Most likely your child for what Cyane has said to you. I suggest you stay near me for awhile. I just killed that fool, and there could be more. Just rest is my advice I'll take care of the rest.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b>
