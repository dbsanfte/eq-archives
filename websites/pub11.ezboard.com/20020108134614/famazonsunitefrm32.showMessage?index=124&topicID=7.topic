But despite the odds, the queen fought with ease and grace in an almost dance.  The flash of steel meeting the dullness of flesh, the blood spraying forth over the air around her made a wicked scene and sound.  Her body twisted in sure moves to fend off the attackers and to make movement towards them the same.  Her sword soon found it's mark underneath one helmet.  But, lodging deep within the man's throat, it was stuck.  She grimmaced as another sent his sword to slice her hip.  Penth turned to face him and sent her bracer to his face knocking him to the side.  <br>
Her eyes again looked to her lodged weapon and placed a foot upon the gasping man's abdomen.  The movement pushed the soldier off her now free weapon and sent him to the ground to breath his last breath.<br>
The amazon refused to allow the deep slice in her hip to slow her down.  She twisted her body to send the freed weapon to the other soldier quickly meeting him as he moved towards her.  The blade making mark deep within his stomach.  As his body fell free of the weapon, Penth let out a wild war cry.  <br>
Her eyes quickly scanned around the battle and saw a pale horse charging her quickly.  Penth did not have time to see who it was and believing it to be the enemy, she sent her sword to fly quickly at the oncoming form.<br>
The silver of the sword flickered as it flew in the air and then lodged itself into the horseman.  Penth ran towards the horseman as the body fell to the ground.  But, as the dust moved to allow her to find the body, there lay an amazon wearing a war mask.  The sword lodged in the ribcage.<br>
Penth quickly removed the sword and found a cloth to cover the gushing wound.  Around her the world seemed oblivious to the woman kneeling over the fallen amazon.  Holding the cloth tight in one hand, the other gently removed the feathered mask.<br>
A cold chill ran thru Penth's body as she saw the face that lay unconcious on the ground.  The &quot;enemy&quot; she had struck, was the blood sister she had finally found.  Penthesilea trembled at the sight of the sister she believed she had killed.  Brown eyes gazed up at Penth, but did not see.  Blood had begun to cover the ground despite the pressure.  Penthesilea picked up the body that was now growing cold and began to walk somberly away from all that was rampaging around them.  Penth held the woman close and whispered to her softly, &quot;I am sorry Hippolyte.  I am sorry.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/umarpeamzn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Marpe Amzn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/20/01 7:29:02 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/MarpeAmznrpg.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Sister on Sister</span><hr size=1> A dark haired amazon suddenly jumped down from the trees and stood in front of Penthesilea.  The woman was dressed in dark black leathers that were now covered in blood from fighting.  She seemed to almost snarl as she moved towards Penth, her arms reaching out and taking the pale queen from her arms savagely. <br>
&quot;I saw what you did this day,&quot; Marpe's eyes were narrowed. &quot;You have taken a life that of an athelfi.  You are no better then the illithios!&quot; Marpe almost growled as she spoke.  &quot;You are nothing but dead to me, amazon!&quot;  Marpe quickly turned and left with Hippolyte in her arms.  <br>
She found a horse and quickly rode away with her vasilissa in her arms back to Themiscrya. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=zephyr>Zephyr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/20/01 7:30:09 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Under Seige</span><hr size=1>         &quot; You'r right Aphrodite, this is pointless...
