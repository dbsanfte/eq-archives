She smiled lightly pulling her blonde hair back, and removing her weapons. Then she kneeled. Her knee shifting into the dust like a rock, and Dawn removed her leather boots. She stood once more, turned and waited for Wulf. This would be lesson 1.<br>

 &quot;We'll start simple, or simple for me that is. Lesson 1 is going to be on staffs. They are pretty simple but I want to start with the basics like I did. It should make everything go quicker and it'll make you stronger.&quot;<br>
<br>
 She stood, and scooped up a staff, she began to twirl it, all the while her eyes rested upon Wulf. With one hand she twirled it behind her, then it came along her side to jab out straight, with that she press it against his stomach and pushed lightly.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Always watch you oppent. Your turn. Mimick me.&quot;<br>
<br>
 She gently tossed him the staff and stood, she wouldn't attack back until he'd learnt to fight with it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Amazon Wulf</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(11/2/00 8:29:24 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lesson 1.</span><hr size=1> This would be easy, he thought. He had seen his mother do this a thousand times. He began to twirl it, all the while his eyes rested upon Dawn. With one hand he twirled it behind him, as she had done. But being over confident as most amazon children are, he brought it around to jab out but instead he lost control and lost the grip letting it hit himself in the head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ouch!&quot; He growled.<br>
<br>
He didn't really get hurt but he didn't want Dawn to think he was too hard. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#993300>(11/3/00 4:25:23 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Lesson 1 (continued)</span><hr size=1>  Dawn sighed, rubbed Wulf's head lightly. Then without a warning or a word's notice, she picked up her staff and held it horizontal.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Watch. Repeat.&quot;<br>
<br>
 She then began to spin the staff infront of her again. Her right hand removed itself, as the left brought it up and over her head. All the while the wooden stick rotated in the air. She brought it down to behind her back, continuing the spin. Until *WHAM* the staff came out from her back to her side, horizontal, with a harder push than before it met Wulf's side, grasping his attention.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Now do it, because you can. I know that.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Bare feet shuffled in the dust carring her backward again. Her Green eyes still had not left the young boy, not during or before the skill and certainly not now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Wulf Amazon Prince</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(11/4/00 4:16:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Staff Training</span><hr size=1> He rubbed his head after she had and he stood tall understanding that she did not care whether he felt pain or not. He grabbed the staff keeping his eyes on her the whole time watching her moves. She brought the staff around and as it came his way he stood there and kept his eyes on her. He knew that at this time it would be stupid to try and avoid being hit by the staff, so he stood there and took the hit as best as he could. As he stood there his eyes became concentrated and stern. He stood tall and began to spin the staff in his right hand. He flung it in the air and caught it with his left, it still spinning as it was done. It flipped behind his back and came out towards the front horizontally with great speed and perfect aim. As it was about to hit Dawn's side, Wulf stopped it perfectly about an inch away from her torso, a grin upon his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
(Note: Just for fun, Wulf has aged a couple years since the meeting in Themiscrya. Sorry but I found it unbelievable that a four year old could handle a staff LOL. So at the moment he appears about 10. Poor Aly LOL) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Dawnithinia Rivent Darkshade</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(11/4/00 5:25:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>  Lesson 2</span><hr size=1>  Dawn smiled lightly as she watched Wulf, never had she trained a young boy that learnt so fast, she then shook her head, there was still more to go, and hard tricks to learn, and blood to feel run. Dawn remembered as a child the worst part about training was the blood that came from her, she was a hard trainee, always hitting harder than the teacher and paying for it in the end. <br>
<br>
 &quot;Wulf stick to the move I show, don't jazz it up...yet.&quot;<br>
<br>
 She spoke sternly, but mothering like, too. She wasn't angry nor happy. Just pleased. After a few moments of silence Dawn scooped up her staff and held it diagonally. Her right hand at the top and left on the bottom. <br>
<br>
 &quot;Blocking. I try to hit you, you try to hit me. And try to place your hardest move, being the one I taught you, into the movement.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn began by simply spinning the staff, then as she spun she moved around Wulf in a circle, her hands never stopping and her feet always moving. Green eyes were locked on her student even as she brought the staff out of spin to his stomach where she jabbed him backwards, then she continued right on spinning.<br>

He kept his eyes on hers all the while making sure that her staff was still in his sight. Ads her jab hit his stomach he stumbled backwards a bit, his staff still held firmly and spinning in a good motion. He did as she told and began blocking her attempts to hit him. He knew she was going easy on him. And for that he was glad.<br>
He then did as she said and used the move she taught him against her. He brought his staff into the motion of the spin after blocking a hit, turned it around his back bringing it forward and jabbing it into her stomach the same as she did to him. Knowing that if he stopped the motion of his staff, she might get a bit upset so instead of doing as his mother taught him, and always help a fallen amazon, he already knew that it was not what Dawn wanted. A warrior does not take hits well especially if their opponent tries to help them up afterwards. The staff stayed in motion as he kept a good blocking distance from Dawn. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Dawnithinia Rivent Darkshade</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(11/4/00 5:55:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>  Lesson 2 (continued)</span><hr size=1>  Dawn not expecting Wulf to attempt so fast for a hit, was knocked back, then fell to her knees, continuing to twirl the staff, the butt end skimming the ground inches from hitting it. She smirked lightly to herself as she brought the top of the staff out to a horizontal stance, whapping Wulf against the knee, taking the week point she hit again sweeping him onto his back. Dawn jumped to her feet, and held the staff to his throat, pressing gently. Her face held a grin so evil you'd think it was Ares himself.<br>
<br>

All his life he loved a challenge. And even when he lsot he enjoyed being able to learn something new. He expected to loose to Dawn. He had been told of the spars that she and his mother faught in, as well as the long told story of the Centaur war of Themiscrya. He was just happy he was not defeated by another male. With a grin on his face almost as wild as Dawn's, he placed his hand on the end of her staff and pushed it aside while sitting up.<br>
<br>

She had loved a challenge and had loved the Centuar war, the fact of the bloodshed had been the best. The grin that was on Dawn's face spread so evil as she remembered the war and the warmth of the Centuars blood. It had covered her body like clothing she loved to wear. Quickly she snapped out of the trance and looked back to Wulf.<br>
<br>
 &quot;We can take a break and snatch some water from my pack, or we can continue and I'll teach you my little secret move on the staff, thats both fun and killer.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Wulf Amazon Prince</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(11/4/00 6:10:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Continued</span><hr size=1> He smiled to her seeing the look on her face was from a memorable thought.

He smirked to her brightly and stood up. <br>
<br>
&quot;I don't need water quite yet Dawn.&quot;<br>
<br>
He smiled and dusted off his vest. The running a hand through his blonde hair he looked at the sky seeing it was already dark. He then thought of his mother wondering if she had already begun her nightly rituals. The thoughts of his mother were as usual interupted by the thoughts of the young amazon girls. . .such an Iolaus. . (LOL).<br>
<br>
&quot;I would love to learn your secrets Dawn.

<br>
 She smirked, her mind games were the best when in battle, but were still found useful in other cases. <br>
<br>
 &quot;Lesson 3 on Staffs. Pretty simple but it can be complicated. Its balance.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 Dawn's hands grasped the staff in a perfect line for horizontal. She then using the staff as her balance flipped over, her hands held the staff midair as her body went over, and then her hands pulled the staff back over her head as she stood. Green eyes looked to Wulf, and then she proceeded in doing another.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I want you to do this first, do a few until you can do them without thinking. It should aid with your balance, and aid you in doing the next trick..as well as some of the other training involved in this trick. Then after this trick, we are gonna stop for a break, whether you feel you need the water or not..because when we get going good..there will be no stopping at all.&quot;<br>
<br>
 She smiled and handed him a staff, Dawn could really train on end for days, she was 256 years old and this was nothing for her. A mere walk in the park, you could say. <br>
<br>
 &quot;Now lets see you do it. I wanna see the true warrior blood come out.&quot;<br>

He felt as though he was growing with age and knowledge all at once. The staff came as an easy task to him. Though he was not ready for the sword yet, he was ready and willing to continue as far as she would let him.<br>
He took the staff in his hands and did as he was told. For hours on end he practiced the flips over the staff. They proceeded with time and effort. Then he could do them not just without thinking, but with placing them into moves and attacks. He could even produce a back flip with it in hands if he wished. His flips were as strong as his fathers, yet smooth and soft like Alys. Hours later he was constructing his own training patterns as his mother always did. He couldn't wait til she could see him in action. For he still had alot of lessons to learn. Alysia told him that he needed to learn from Dawn, Hipp and Ara. So he knew that he couldn't become exactly like the warrior who was teaching him so rapidly. <br>
Though he admired her need to spill her enemies blood, he had his mothers soft heart and always wanted a peacful way of handling things. He did however like the fighting process as his parents and of course found a good need of it.<br>
<br>
At last he completed a final perfect flip and landed on both feet one in front of the other.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright, let's get some water.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Dawnithinia Rivent Darkshade</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(11/5/00 5:31:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Water Break.</span><hr size=1>  Dawn smiled, she admired the talent Aly and Iolaus had passed on to the young boy. Through the respect she had learned she knew this young child would do alot for the Amazons, whether or not some wanted him around was no longer the issue. Dawn knew all the while what her blessing had brought to him, the blood of the Roman Assassin was ment only to protect him, a low growl emitted from Dawn as she remembered Ara had taken the soul of Dawn's kill. She still hated that fact. That was her kill, her soul. <br>
<br>
 &quot;Anything you want to ask Wulf?&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn kneeled pulling two containers of water from a leather saddle bag, one she tossed to him and the other she opened for herself. Once she had taken a short sip she shifted from her knee into a sitting position. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Wulf Amazon Warrior</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(11/6/00 11:33:26 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>  . . . . </span><hr size=1> He sat down and grabbed the skin of water, took a sip and sighed looking up at the dark sky. <br>
<br>
&quot;Dawn, what's it like to take a life?&quot;<br>
<br>
He had heard so many stories and differences on the topic. Mostly from his mother of course. He wanted to know.<br>
<br>
&quot;I mean, mother keeps a large cabinent of Gabrielle's ancient scrolls. I read them often and the stories are. . .nothing less than amazing. But, the way she descirbed her first kill. . . it's. . .kinda odd. I mean the way you talk about it, it seems as to you there is nothing in the world greater. . but when mother and Gabrielle speak it seems as though every death is painful. Unless it is a Roman or Centaur of course.&quot;<br>
<br>
He took another sip and sat down by her, pushing the stray blonde hairs out of his face he continued to look at the moon all the wjile knowing that the Atmah is watching over him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Dawnithinia Rivent Darkshade</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(11/6/00 8:03:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Death o' living?</span><hr size=1>  Dawn sighed lightly, inhaling deeply..as she pondered the question.<br>
<br>
 &quot;It depends on the position. If you wish not to take the life, but know you must..then yes it is painful. I had to kill my own blood sister. It hurt me deep inside for a long while. I know she forgives me for what I had to do. Even though I did not want to. Those types of death are the worst, not only on the victim but on the assassin themselves. It hurts the heart, and the brain. Life seems to stand still forever.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn took a long gulp from the water skin, pushing the cork back in as she was ready to talk again. Looking back from the sky to Wulf she smiled lighlty.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Now, if you take the life in a heat of battle, it can be such a great pleasure. If you are the right warrior. The most fun and pleasure I have had in a kill, was when you were born, Wulf. You were a special item that day. I assure you of that.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn grinned evily, hold her hands out, and stretching, remembering the fun she had.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Aly had just fallen asleep with you in her arms, I had made my way to the bar for some Vodka. I wasn't in the light and very easy to pass over. Besides everyone knows how dumb Romans are! The assassin just walked right on it, drew his sword and prepared to kill you. I watched the man enter, and watched him draw his sword. As he was ready to kill you, I flipped and rolled across the tables, slamming him into the wall with a swift kick to the back. The adrenline started to rush, and so did the lust for the kill. I craved killing him and wasn't going to rest until that man was dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
 A quiet pop was heard as Dawn uncorked the skin and drank from it again, then she began once more.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I thrusted my daggers into his shoulders, the blood began to gush all over my hands, it was so warm and smooth. It almost pulsed with its own heartbeat...I could have slept in it. I get into my kills, especially Roman kills.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Another evil look had spread over Dawn, yes she got into her memories just like they were her kills.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I pounded the Hades outta him, and it finish most of it off, I dug my thumbs into his shoulder wounds, breaking the muscle and bones with them. His insides were like a hot summer day, and so gushy. It was so wonderful killing him. I left him against the bar dead, for the rememberence. And then Arahute took his soul to bless you.&quot;<br>
<br>
 She growled lowly, sipping her water gently.<br>
<br>
 &quot;That was my soul, that is one thing that woman will learn when I finally talk to her. That was my soul, my kill and not hers. So feel very blessed young Wulf, you've got a Roman watching over you, something I would not have.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn stood, calming herself down as much as possible.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I will admit to you, that your mother does not like to kill. But it is not for her to decide what you do. If you feel that you wish to become an Assassin, and not just a warrior. I will teach you that further step. For my lessons will only take you to the warrior stage. The blood lust is for you to decide..&quot;<br>
<br>
 The small body of Dawn leaned against the balance beem, finishing her water.<br>
<br>
 &quot;All I can say is, taking the life of someone is one of the most blessed thing on Earth, because not very many can do such a thing without guilt. My blood lust is very much granted my the Atmah. Just like your glorious future will be. I grantee with all the help you'll get, you are truely bond for greatness. Anything else Wulf? I love answering and telling stories about the past.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;Dawn, what was my mother like when she was a young amazon?&quot;<br>
<br>
The question had pondered his mind for a good while for she only told him of stories after Scynthia was born. He also had been wondering why everyone loved him so much. He was a male, and amazons don't get too fond of males. Especially ones that are growing up to be an amazon. He laughed at the thought. But keeping the many questions about his birth and before hand to himself, he glanced at Dawn waiting for the answer about his mother. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Dawnithinia Rivent Darkshade</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(11/7/00 4:27:33 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ..</span><hr size=1>  Dawn sighed looking at Wulf, her green eyes closed for a moment.<br>
<br>
 &quot;To tell you the truth young one, I didn't know your mother until she was my RoC...I chose her then because she seemed pretty sensible and determined. The one to ask that to is your mother or even Hippolyte. I'm not very good with that subject, although it would intrigue me to know aswell.&quot;<br>
<br>
 She grinned lightly, pulling out a bit of warm turkey meat, she unwrapped it from the hide of a deer and held some out to Wulf.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Only a bit, or you'll get sleepy, and well you can't train half awake.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Amazon Prince Wulf</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(11/7/00 4:50:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> He nodded and then took a piece of the meat and then washed it down with some more water.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you really think I can be as good as you Dawn?&quot;<br>
<br>
He said as he stood up and stretched out a bit to begin training once more. He leaned over reaching for the staff and did a few practice flips over it to warm himself up.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's next?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Dawnithinia Rivent Darkshade</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(11/7/00 4:59:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Lesson 3 o'4 lost count</span><hr size=1>  Dawn stood stretching her body, and then take her staff, she stuck it into the ground and spun her body around it her feet straight outward, as she spun. It was a quick warm up.<br>
<br>
 &quot;You can be as good as you want, but to be as good as me, you have to be an assassin or a good warrior. You just want to want it bad enough.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn smiled as she stood, dusting herself off and stretching once more, then she took her place on the balance beem. The staff was held out in the fimilar horizontal line.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Its basically a review. First you are going to practice, the first trick. The spin. You'll stand here and do them until you don't loose your balance. Then when you feel you can accomplish that, you will walk back and forth on the beem doing the same trick. Then we'll go on from there.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn dropped from the beam and stood back to watch him, she knew there was a long road ahead, because Wulf hadn't learned regular flips, spins, and yet balance. This was going to be a long task..but fun in the process. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessageRange?topicID=69.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessageRange?topicID=69.topic&start=41&stop=51>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessage?topicID=103.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessage?topicID=100.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.emailToFriend?topicID=69.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.threadControl?topicID=69.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=69.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=69.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm28">Amazon Sisters of Cremni<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya>Sisters of Themiscrya</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
