Hungry</span><hr size=1> Zel just got back from a meeting in the Realm of Darkness. She was only gone 4 days,and frankly the meetings didn't go as baddly as she thought it would.<br>
<br>
She walked into her lil home,tossing her travel baggy by the door as she came in.<br>
<br>
She looks around,and listens. Couldn't hear nothing,so she guessed noone was home,maybe not even Varia's wolf pets.<br>
<br>
&quot;Welp...dooby doo,hungry...&quot; She walks to the kitchen and starts looking around for something to eat;she'd gotten very hungry from the trip,and having wierd cravings.<br>
<br>
She grabs a large covered bowl from the ice box,and opens it and smells the left-overs. Wrinkles her nose. &quot;Ewwww.&quot; Closes the bowl quickly and puts it back in the ice box.<br>
<br>
Goes to the cubard,and grabs a few things out of them,then places them on the counter. Grabs a bowl,puts some broken bread in it,then grabs some dried meat and puts it in the bowl too,then grabs a banana and breaks it up into pieces,and puts that in the bowl too,then returns to the ice box,and fishes around for the hidden bottle of red liquid she had hidden in there. &quot;Ah ha!&quot; Finding the bottle she pours the red liquid (blood) into the bowl with the rest of the mixture. She then grabs a spork and stirs the mixture around,then takes a bite. &quot;Pretty good,but missing something....&quot; Grabs some salt and pours a bunch into the mixture,then once again returns to the ice box,looking for something else. She uses her sence of smell,which wasn't working that well since she's pregnant and all. She sniffs out something,and grabs it,anchovies(sp). She eyes the lil fishys,then puts some of them in the bowl with the mixture. Takes a bite. &quot;Much better!&quot; <br>
<br>
She pours the rest of the blood into a cup,grabs her bowl then walks into the living room and sits down on the sofa,setting the cup on the center table,then starts grubbing on the wierd mixture in the bowl. Has a craving for salted Hestian flesh,but since she ain't got none of that,she'd do with plain ol blood. Hmph. Even being mortal with destroyer abilities turned off,and pregeo,didn't get rid of her cravings for flesh;but sure added the cravings for things she'd never eat if she was in her 'normal' state. <p>~ If I snap,you'll be the first to go.~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uxdeiamaex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>XDeiaMaeX</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#993300>(10/10/02 8:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=103.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Returned from the Dark Realm &amp; Hungry</span><hr size=1>  Deia ran in from outside, giggling wildly as her lil fox, Began chased her around the room.

Began dashed off...almost a child himself in his eagerness to play. The leopard just climbed up the nearest tree, laying down on one of the overhead branches, her tail falling down and swishing back and forth.<br>

Zelia was just as clueless as Deia was as to where the fox and leopard were hiding,that it made her get a little frustrated,she hated the fact her heightened sences werent working...but she dealt with it.<br>
<br>
Taking a wild guess,Zel pointed. &quot;Over there!&quot; Then swoosh,she took off in a sprint,bounding over to a bush. When she came upon the bush,she lept or rather pounced at it,basically diving into the bush.<br>
<br>
With the sound of breaking bush stems,and a light squeek from getting poked in the butt by a bush branch,Zel popped her head up out of the bush,and looked over toward Deia. &quot;False alarm!&quot; She then did a two thumbs up. &quot;And i'm A okay!&quot; She re-assured Deia,then slunk down into the bush,and rubbed her bottom before finally climbing out of the bush. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uxrikaslyhx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xRikaslyhx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#993300>(10/12/02 10:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=103.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Searching</span><hr size=1>  ((sorry, thought i was on Deia's sn...grr me.))<br>

  She giggled helplessly as she watched Zelia dive into the bush, then pop back up. When she finally recovered from it, she looked around again, pouting softly. Laughing, she looked up at the leopardess in the tree above her. &quot;Dat cheating Areia. We's no climb up af'er you's.&quot; Deia hopped up and down, trying to grab onto Areia's tail, finally giving up after a few moments. &quot;You's gotsta find Began wif us, Areia,&quot; she said, practically scolding the big cat...if that was possible.<br>
<br>
 The leopard was down in a few leaps, waiting patiently as Deia clambered onto her back, then padded over to Zelia, peering up at her with those eerie amber eyes that seemed to know too much for any animal. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uxrikaslyhx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xRikaslyhx</A> at: 10/12/02 10:28:58 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uiizeliaii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>II Zelia II</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 246<br> <font color=#993300>(10/13/02 4:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=103.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/iizeliaii/images/zel-1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Searching</span><hr size=1> Zel looked at Deia,then at the leopard and quirked an eyebrow.
