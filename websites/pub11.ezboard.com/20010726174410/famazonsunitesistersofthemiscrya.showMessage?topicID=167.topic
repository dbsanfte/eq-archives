First after the war with the Romans from the Alternate Universe, she lost her only son in death. She also was there to witness the birth of her Granddaughter Melody and find out that she was going to be a Roman Goddess instead of an amazon. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She also found out that her eldest daughter, Cora, was with child again and Alysia then found out that she herself was indeed pregnant as well. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Eli's child was supposed to bring great happiness into her life, but it seemed to bring nothing of the sort. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After the war in Scynthia, Alysia heard that amazons from Varia's village had taken Eve hostage and were putting her on trial and intended to put her to death. This all had happened when Aly was at war, she couldn't stop it. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When Alysia awoke from her sleep after the war, she received a scroll from one of the Queen's of the Amazon Nation. The Amazons had been called to war by the son of Artemis. Alysia was almost too late. She was able to get there for the final battle, where the amazons won. <br>
<br>
&quot;To a strong Amazon Nation.&quot;<br>
<br>
Those words echoed in Aly's head more than anything. That's when she pulled the tribes together in the council for meetings. She did not want to loose anymore sisters than she already had. Her mind, soul, body and heart were aching badly. And instead of resting like she should be, she was traveling back and forth from Gabrielle's village to Rome where Livia had taken throne to.<br>
<br>
Alysia's best friend had returned to her evil state and wanted to wage war against the amazons for their transgressions against her. Alysia knew that this was not Eve, that there was something evil lurking behind it all. And there was. . .the mask of Juride had been told to her by Eli many times.. But when the mask took Eli's daughter Fayla and turned her back into the evil daughter of Genesis. .. . Jexanna, All Hell had broken loose in Rome. And though Alysia felt the pain that Eli was going through watching this evil thing that was his daughter. . .she couldn't help think of Genesis and what she must be going through. She knew that Eli needed to be with Gen at the time, but how could she tell him to leave his daughter and go help his ex-girlfriend? Alysia decided she would let fate decided everything else. . .<br>
<br>
Alysia had many thoughts running through her head, she couldn't even stand straight to think on her own without some force grabbing her and putting thoughts into her head. She felt she had lost everything there was to loose. All except the amazons. No matter how much Livia tortured her, no matter how much pain they put her through . .Alysia would never betray her sisters, &quot;the Amazon Nation was going to be stronger than ever&quot;, she kept telling herself.<br>
<br>
She had to get away. . . . . .<br>

She placed one hand down on her belly as if to let the child within know that she is still there. She looked to her fellow amazons that had come to her in greetings. Many of them asked her about the war of Helicon. Others talked about Livia and things. But Alysia blocked those awful images from her mind. She smiled as they caught the hint and then asked Aly about the baby. . . <br>
<br>
&quot;Is it a boy or girl Aly?&quot; A younger Trainee amazon teen asked her.<br>
<br>
Alysia smiled. &quot;It is a girl, I am sure of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Have you chosen a name?&quot; Another asked her.<br>
<br>
Alysia thought to herself. &quot;You know, I am still trying to think of one.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;When is it due?&quot; A younger amazon child asked.<br>
<br>
Alysia laughed. . .for the first time in months, she laughed. &quot;I am not sure little one, immortal babies have a thing for coming out at bad times. And most inconvenient places.&quot;<br>
<br>
Indeed, she thought to herself. Cora was born in an amazon village of course, but had to be immediately taken to Rome commanded by the Fates. Aliya and Alexa were both born in Rome. . Sadly. . .and dear Wulf had been born in Themiscrya with many amazons around. It was too bad that Romans had to come and try to assassinate the male baby. <br>
<br>
Romans had cursed Alysia life for as long as she could remember. .. but right now she tried to get rid of those thoughts. She had told Gabrielle to leave the amazons and go back to Xena where she belonged. It was time for Alysia to take her own advice. As much as she loved Eli, she couldn't remain in Rome. She couldn't be there to fight against Livia, Jexanna, or the mask. She couldn't even go to Eli's temple at the moment. She needed peace in the tribes she belonged to. She needed to be with her sisters. She needed to go home.<br>
