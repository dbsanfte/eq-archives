<br>
Queen Rhiannon made her daily trek to the Meeting Hall,  where she met Queen Chiara for her lessons.<br>
She'd had no idea when she'd signed on for the job that there would be so much involved, so much she still needed to learn. Besides learning the customs of the tribe and the names of her athelfi, she had also had to study Amazon law and train with weaponry.<br>
As she approached the door, she was feeling a mix of excitement and dread. She wondered what Chiara had in store for her today.<br>
Taking a deep breath, Rhiannon entered. <br>
Chiara recognized that she intimidated Rhiannon at times, but considered it part of the girl's training to learn to say what needed to be said anyway.  She looked up from the scroll she had been reviewing.<br>
&quot;Rhiannon... good morning.&quot;  A pause.  &quot;I've sent for tea... did you get a chance to read over that scroll? <br>
As Chiara had come to expect, seeing Rhiannon's drive to succeed at her new responsibilities, the redhead nodded that she had.<br>
&quot;Good.  It mostly dealt with questions of recommended procedure when an unknown person was found on Amazon land.  Why do you think I had you, who is queen of domestic affairs, learn it?   <br>
&quot;Because as Queen of domestic affairs, I would probably be the most likely to be in or near the village if such an occasion arose. And since visitors would need to be dealt with quickly, whoever was closest would be the one to take care of it.&quot;<br>
Rhia, glad that Chiara had started her out with something she was confident about, waited for Chiara's answer. <br>
Chiara nodded.  &quot;Your answer is a good one.  In many cases, it would fall to you to see things were handled properly.&quot;  The queen paused, meeting her young sister's eyes.  &quot;The other central reason you must know such things is to know when standing orders have NOT been obeyed. Some circumstances may excuse that, but if that does not seem to be the case... you must ask yourself why an Amazon would deal violently with a person to be protected or allow a troublemaker to go.&quot; <br>
Rhia looks a little confused, but is taking it all in. The Shatomlics are a rather isolated tribe, so Rhia had never really learned from them how Amazons dealt with outsiders.<br>
She nods, waiting for Chiara to continue with the lesson.  <br>
Chiara sees the confusion, realizing she should have expected it of someone with Rhiannon's trusting nature.  She smiles, gently.<br>
&quot;Luckily, Amazons behave themselves for the most part.  We're trained to obey.&quot; <br>
The War Queen paused, before continuing. <br>
&quot;Right now, at least... I don't want you handling cases that you sense have a lot going on under the surface.  Those have a tendency to become dangerous.  Find some pretext to bring me into the discussion, and I'll guide you.  If I'm out of the village, stall until I return.  Can you think of a few ways to do that?&quot;   <br>
Rhia thinks for a moment and realizes that her first reaction would've been to say she needed to talk to Chiara, or to say that she needed more time to think about it. She dismisses these as being wrong, and tries to think of a right answer.<br>
&quot;I don't remember reading in any of the scrolls if there was a way to postpone a decision on a case.&quot; <br>
Chiara smiled.  &quot;I never said they were in the scrolls.&quot;  She clasped her hands together on top of the desk. <br>
&quot;The law gives the presiding queen a lot of discretion in determining how trials are run.  If you can find a point in the case that requires further proof - and there's always something - investigating that can take up time.  You can also say that you wish to spend some period of time in the temple in prayer and contemplation over the case, or if the timing is right that the trial should be postponed until the harvest is in, or a particularly large war party is in.  There's also the possibility of feigning illness, but I don't reccomend it.&quot;<br>
hia laughs. &quot;So it's okay to use lame excuses sometimes? I thought it would have to be a biggie..&quot;<br>
She creates imaginery scenarios in her head, picturing herself stalling for time with these methods <br>
&quot;No, not a 'biggie'... just be subtle.&quot;  Chiara reached for another scroll, and unrolled it, displaying a detailed map of their lands.  There are dots scattered across it, and a legend tying each color of dot to a prey animal.  &quot;This is this the hunting record so far this year...&quot;  She opens another scroll.  &quot;And, this is two years ago's.  What do you notice about these, Rhiannon?&quot;<br>
Rhia studies the two maps for a few moments.<br>
&quot;This area up here,&quot; she points to the map. &quot;is more heavily hunted than it was two years ago. If the hunting keeps increasing at this same rate, then in just a couple of years there will be almost nothing there to hunt.&quot; <br>
Chiara smiles like what she is - a teacher with a particularly bright pupil.  &quot;Exactly, Rhiannon. And, where would you shift the hunting to?&quot; <br>
&quot;Well...&quot; Rhia studies the map again. &quot;Right here, in this area where almost no hunting is done. &quot;<br>
Chiara nods.  &quot;Yes, some of the hunting could be shifted there.  But not all.  I've been to that area, and the tree cover is thin.  There's not as many large animals as one would guess, and the hunters would have to be particularly careful not to be seen or smelled. Where else?&quot;  She looks over to Rhia, awaiting an answer. <br>
Dori ran through the door to the council hall and slid to a halt right in front of the Queens, eyes wide open.  &quot;Oops.&quot;  She said, looking back over her shoulder, then back to the Queen, trying to catch her breath and getting ready for the fit she knew Chiara was about to throw. <br>
Rhia had just been about to speak when Dori ran in to the Hall.<br>
She noticed how fast the princess had run in and how heavily she was breathing and became concerned.<br>
&quot;Dori, are you alright?&quot; Rhia got up and put an arm around the other woman's shoulder, moving her to sit in the chair she's just vacated.<br>
&quot;What happened?&quot; <br>
Sitting down, Dori avoided looking at Chiara, getting her breath she looked up at Rhia instead, &quot;I'm fine my Queen.  I uh...we were...&quot;  she sighed knowing that Chiara had to be giving her the &quot;look&quot;.  Swallowing, &quot;I'm sorry I interrupted, my sisters and I were fooling around.&quot;  The dark haired princess looked down at her hands, feeling a tad bit ashamed.   <br>
&quot;Doriana, I understand needing to run off some energy,&quot; Chiara replied.  While not angry, her voice had a certain edge that did not bode well for the Princess.  &quot;But, since you have so much, maybe there's a more productive use for it.  Rhiannon and I were just discussing where to shift hunting to.&quot; <br>
Dori peeked up at Chiara and bit her lip, standing quickly, she said, &quot;Well then I guess I should let you get to it then.&quot;  She turned to head for the door, knowing it couldn't be that easy to get away. <br>
&quot;No...&quot;  Chiara said, silkily.  &quot;I'd like to get your impression on the issue.  You do spend more time out than I have been able to lately.&quot; <br>
Chiara knew she was being tough on Dori for a simple gaffe, but it was necessary if the young woman was going to be a great queen someday, as her mother had been.  And, it was Chiara's responsibility now to see that she did.   Dori stopped at Chiara's words and clenched her jaw, vowing to kill one pain in the butt best friend of hers.  Turning she looked back over at the queens and sighed.  She walked over to the map and studied it quietly.  Motioning to one area, &quot;We've over-extended ourselves here, and while this looks like a good area, there isn't enough forest to sustain animals, and over here, our borders aren't as secure as we'd like them.  So unless we want to add the extra danger of being picked off by our enemies while hunting, I'd say the best places are here...&quot;  She pointed near the long flowing river, then motioned to another area where their were grassy fields bordering dense forest, &quot;and here.  Give the other hunting ground time to replenish.&quot;  With that answer she looked up at Chiara and cocked a dark brow waiting for a response. <br>

As far as that less secure area goes, wether we hunt there or not I want another patrol set up.  We have the warriors for it now.&quot;<br>
Dori nodded, &quot;I'll see to that patrol personally.&quot;  She once again turned and made for the door. Hoping that she would this time be more successful then before.<br>
Chiara decided that Doriana had learned her lesson, mostly. <br>
&quot;Good... but, that will take a day or two.  I'd like for you and Tristan to take it this evening.&quot; <br>
Expecting her order to be obeyed, Chiara turned her attention back to Rhiannon. <br>
&quot;I'd like for you to inform the hunt mistresses of the decision we've made once we're done here... I think you'll like them, Rhiannon.&quot;   <br>
Dori stopped short and turned back around after Chiara gave her orders, &quot;But...&quot;  she took a deep breath, &quot;I thought I was past having to do overnight patrols.  I have a...&quot; She motioned to her hut, &quot;Zoe, and well I don't like...&quot;  She stopped knowing she sounded rather childish but she was rather used to sleeping with Zoe and it being only a few days before her joining, she really hated not being with her intended.  She might be almost twenty seasons old, but she knew how to throw a royal fit when she needed to. <br>
Chiara looked up, raising a brow. <br>
&quot;I'm fully aware of the fact you'd rather be home with your fiancee.  Perhaps you should have been too, before running in here.  As for being 'past' doing overnight patrols, it's a job that needs to be done to protect your sisters.  No one, not even me, is above that Princess.&quot;   <br>
Dori muttered under her breath, &quot;Then why don't you spend the night out there.&quot;  Out loud she responded, &quot;Yes my Queen, my *sister* Tristin and I will take the overnight patrol.&quot;  Her sister was about to have the night from hell if Dori had anything to do about it. <br>
Chiara heard the muttered comment, but chose to ignore it for now since Doriana was no longer arguing with her.<br>
&quot;Good... Thank you.&quot;  The queen turned her attention back to Rhia. <br>
Rhia was smiling when Chiara looked over to her. She watched Doriana leave the Hall, and then turned back to the desk. &quot;You two are very much like family to each other, aren't you?&quot; She didn't wait for a reply. &quot;I mean, that's good, since her Aella passed, that she has someone to be family for her...You just reminded me of a mother and daughter there.&quot;<br>
Chiara gave Rhiannon a chagrined look.  &quot;Can you say it was more like older sister and younger?  I don't think Doriana and Zoe are planning to wait to have children and I am at least a decade from wanting to be a grandmother.&quot;  She prays Angie gives her that long...<br>
Rhia is immediately regrettful. &quot; I didn't mean to imply anything with regards to your age...I was only talking about the tone of your voice...&quot; <br>
Chiara, seeing how seriously Rhia has taken her comment, immediately softens her features. <br>
&quot;Our relationship has always been a bit complicated.  Her mother helped me a lot when I first became Queen... so we're very much like true sisters in that way.  But she's also been my student, and possible heir, so I do have a certain more maternal authority.&quot; <br>
Chiara gives a slight shrug.<br>
&quot;Now, with Aella's death, the responsibility for her training falls almost entirely to me.  Thank the gods she's an adult though... I can't imagine teaching a fourteen or fifteen year old.&quot;   <br>
Rhiannon nods, realizing she'd misinterpreted Chiara's words.<br>
&quot;I suppose it would get a little confusing that way.&quot;<br>
Rhia changes the subject, wanting to get her lessons over with quickly.<br>
&quot;Was there anything else you had to teach me today?&quot; <br>
Chiara runs over her mental list of subjects to cover, and finds one urgent. <br>
&quot;Yes...  Doriana and Zoe are to be married soon and as a queen you'll be helping to officiate.  I have a scroll around here somewhere that's something of a script...&quot;  Chiara begins to search. &quot;Where the Hades... Ah...&quot;  She finds the scroll and gives it a triumphant shake before handing it to Rhiannon.  &quot;Take half an hour or an hour and go over this, and keep track of any questions or parts you need clarified.  Then come back and we'll talk it over.&quot; <br>
Rhiannon unrolls the scroll and glances at it quickly, then rolls it back up, grinning.<br>
&quot;Finally, something I can get into.&quot;<br>
She taps the scroll on the desk twice as she gets up, grins at Chiara, then walks out the door to review the scroll in the sunshine. <br>
Chiara watches the young queen go, a bit curious as to Rhia's enthusiasm over Amazon weddings. She shrugs.  Rhia probably just loves weddings and love in general. <br>
Knowing the contacts she made with other Queens during her trip need to be maintained, Chiara pulls out a blank scroll and inks up her quill... <br>
Rhia returns, scroll in hand. She sits down in front of Chiara, and not waiting for the older Queen to look up even, begins speaking.<br>
&quot;This is so sweet. Very romantic. Very...Amazon.&quot; she giggles. &quot;I had thought there would be more references to blood and battles though. I do have a couple of questions.<br>
I am not familiar with Greek mythology. And I have never heard anything like this- that humans used to have four arms and two heads, and then were seperated and always seek to find their other half. This must be a very ancient ritual.&quot; <br>
Chiara gives a laugh at Rhiannon's enthusiasm.  &quot;I guess I don't need to ask if you're a romantic, do I?&quot;<br>
Rhiannon blushes slightly.<br>
&quot;And, yes, it is a very ancient story,&quot; Chiara continued.  &quot;That's why I trust there's a deeper truth to it.&quot; <br>
Feeling like she has said a bit too much, she redirects the discussion.  &quot;You thought there would be blood and battles?&quot; <br>
Rhiannon grins. &quot;Well, that is what the Amazons are most famous for. And even though I know now that that's not what we're ALL about, there is always some truth behind the rumors. We ARE predominantly warriors, after all. &quot; <br>
&quot;True enough... We do all at least learn to defend ourselves.&quot;  Chiara sighed.  &quot;I know Aella was looking forward to officiating at her daughter's wedding one day.  I'd have to talk it over with Doriana first, of course, but what would you think of adding some symbol of Aella's presence to the ceremony?&quot; <br>
The War Queen hadn't allowed herself to consider for long what the symbol should be, deciding it was more important it be meaningful for Dori than herself.<br>
&quot;I think that's perfect! I'm sure Doriana will love it.&quot;<br>
Rhia looked a little sad for a second, thinking about how Aella should have been here talking about Doriana's marriage instead of her.  <br>
Chiara's expression is sad as well, and that provides a certain moment of connection between the two Queens. <br>
&quot;I think she will, too... I just don't want to make that decision for her.&quot; <br>
The War Queen sighs.<br>
&quot;So, do you think you have a good grasp on your responsibilities in this ceremony?&quot;<br>
Rhia waves the scroll a little.<br>
&quot;It doesn't seem that difficult. I would have to memorize my part. Putting meaning to it won't be hard, I'm a sucker for romance.&quot;<br>
She smiles once again, imagining herself and Chiara at Dori and Zoe's marriage ceremony.  <br>
Baily straightened out her leathers and frowned at herself in the mirror... a skirt, damnit... she looked ridiculous. Self consciously she made her way to the counsel hut and back to Chiara's office, knocking on the door and peeking her head in. <br>
By now, Chiara recognized the knock. <br>
&quot;Baily, come in...&quot;  While she was pleased to see her partner for any reason, to have her present now seemed... fated.  Chiara stood when Baily entered the room, and greeted her with a chaste, but hardly sisterly, kiss.  &quot;Rhiannon and I were just discussing plans for Dori and Zoe's wedding.&quot;   <br>
She still felt self conscious in the skirt, and was glad Chiara didn't comment. She returned the kiss and put an arm loosely around her waist. &quot;When is the wedding to take place? I forget already...&quot; She smiled softly. &quot;And is there anything I can do to help?&quot; <br>
