Two different personas locked inside one body. The one to return to Lympus was Athena's War Goddess persona.<br>
<br>
Crimson red lights burst into the throne room of Olympus and when they disappeared the Great War Maiden herself stood there. She wore her golden battle skirt, the aegis, and her red locks were braided with matching strands. Two serpents coiled each of her arms from wrist to shoulder.<br>
<br>
Those usually grey eyes during her Wisdom persona were completely black, seeming as though she had no eyes. Her bare ivory feet paded to her throne and sat down quietly. <p>_.- Goddess Athena, Goddess of Wisdom, War, the arts, and crafts -._<br>

Arrogance befell Poseidon and he approached the goddess discarding what would be a snarl from his face. He say on the arm rest of Athena's throne and laid an arm across the top of the back rest. His fingers tapped the throne and he leaned into Athena as if the give her a kiss. This he did not do however, he instead leaned in to her ear and whispered words of warning to her that he had wanted to give to her for a long time. &quot;If ever again you take what is mine or interfere in any business concerning me, even your father won't be able to help you when I come to lay down my hands on you. Than you shall be truly taught something of war.&quot; At that the god rose and walked to the far end of the hall to exit it as he waas going to do from before he caught site of Athena.

Megaera giggled walking towards him.<br>
&quot;Bad bad boy Poseidon. We might have to punish you for that one.&quot;<br>

A plot would be in order...but not today. <br>
<br>
&quot;The time for honouring yourself will be at an end, Poseidon. Watch your back...or I'll be chewing on it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Athena feared none, she stood tall and proud. When the Furies made their appearance, those raven pools gave them a glance and a slight smile crossed her features. Her focus returned to the leaving Poseidon. Now I know hwere Hypnos won his arrogance, she thought to herself. This quarrel affected more than just Poseidon and Athena. For Hephaestus had ATTEMPTED to rape Athena, but instead only Gaia was ravaged.<br>
<br>
She was infact, Zeus's favored. Nothing could ever changed that. Zeus was rightfully King of the Gods, anything that happened he could rule over. <p>_.- Goddess Athena, Goddess of Wisdom, War, the arts, and crafts -._<br>

Stealing a glance to Zeus' favorite, Poseidon said to the Erinyes, &quot;No, nothing much going on here. I just caught Athena as I was headed out and paid her my condolances.&quot; He grinned as he played along with their seeming ignorance. <br>
<br>
Athena shot back at Poseidon after he had spoken to the three sisters and the god laughed in arrogance. &quot;Athena, my back is always watched. None on Olympus or on the wide carpets of the earth, not even your brother Apollo can hold their own in battle with me for long. None but your father that is. And with himn I have no quarrel.
