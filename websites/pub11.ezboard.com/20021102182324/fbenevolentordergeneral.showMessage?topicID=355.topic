We must do something to increase the numbers in our guild.  I have spoken with Germania about this very issue and I believe we may be heading towards a policy of a similar nature to what you are recommending.  We may go as far as starting a process of open recruiting for a period of time, just untill we are able to strengthen our numbers then establish a permanent policy of setting a lvl limit.  I agree that we need to target the &quot;younger&quot; population in the game.  Those lower level players are itching at the chance to be involved and we need to take advantage of that.  I think that I will soon be the Officer in charge of Recruitment and I need all of your suggestions on what we can do to bolster our numbers.<br>

This idea is not a bad one, however, there is one major flaw.  As I see it benevolent order's problem with membership started when high level members started leaving this guild to join other guilds with greater numbers of high level people in order to participate in large raids.  Recruiting more low level members will increase membership, but without the ability to run raids we will inevitably loose people again and again.  I realize though that recruiting higher level people is very difficult and I don't have any better recruitment ideas than this one.  And I must admit at least it would be doing something, which is better than what we're doing right now.  I just wanted to point out that it will likely do little good since people will just leave again.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Sorry, I realize this isn't a very enthusiastic post.

I agree most definitely that something needs to be done, ASAP, to get our membership ranks back up.  That is the reason I have asked Brastil to take on the job of recruiting.  Your ideas are fine Karthur, although if you note, they are the same ideas that Jakonis has raised over the last several weeks.  The biggest issue with recruiting very low level players is that they tend to join a guild with some misconceptions about what a guild is all about.   Many lower level players folks tend to call on higher level members for different things, and while this is appropriate in most cases, the practice can be abused.  If you can recruit members and inform them of the rules, i.e. we are all out to help others, both guildmates and otherwise, but not necessarily take everything we can from others.<br>
<br>
I too, am in a fairly tough mood, but do acknowledge the need to move forward and grab some other players.  Therefore, Brastil, you go forward using the good judgement you always do, and get us some new members.  I agree that for the time being, those of us that want to go on raids will have to do so through the alliance with Mystic Entity.<br>
<br>
By the way, Karthur, please realize that people have real lives out there, and we will respond to posts when we get a chance.  Take care and be safe all.<br>

<br>
As my guild's Ambassador to Benevolent Order, I feel obligated to post on this thread.  I hope none of you mind.....<br>
<br>
I think all of your ideas are great and the cautions brought forth regarding recruiting of this nature are all quite valid. And this same discussion ran through our guild about a month ago when we had some high levels depart for the same reasons.......no one else to play with in the guild, not enough opportunties to hunt in the planes, dragon raids and so on.<br>
<br>
We, at Mystic Entity, have always been of the belief that if you NEED to be a member of a high level guild to get into a high level raid....then the choice you make to leave is yours - but joining a guild JUST to raid or leaving a guild for that same reason is not what it is all about in the long run.<br>
<br>
People who come and go for those reasons do so because of certain needs, wants and desires and are given full reign to make whatever choices need to be made.  BUT, in our eyes, a guild is a family.....we are all brothers and sisters with a vision that is shared and that vision does NOT revolve around uber-loot or uber-hunting.  <br>
<br>
NOW don't get me wrong, we all want to have the best gear and hunt in more dangerous places and slay dragons and so on.  None of us want to be level 60 paladins wearing full bronze armor.....<wink><br>
<br>
But as many in our guild have proven.....you dont need a particular GUILD TAG flying over your head to go to those places.  It's about reputations, friendships, alliances and the such.  Our guild leader and higher ups have gone on many a plane raid, dragon raid and hunted in the so-called uber zones.....all without feeling they had to un-guild to do it.<br>
<br>
Why? Because they have forged friendships, reputations and alliances that speak as loudly and perhaps more clearly than any guildflag can.  Snork Spiritsurfer, Aquila Swiftspirit, Kalkien Kindredspirit, Sarwin and others are always welcome on raids to planes, dragon zones and etc....no matter what guild is doing the raiding.  NOT because of the guild they belong to, BUT because of who they are and what their actions represent.<br>
<br>
I, myself, have friends of very high levels and in the so-called uberguilds that have offered membership to me. I chose not to go.....why, because I dont want to leave my family.  They understood, applauded me on my convictions and said that when I am of a level to participate....I am always welcome with them on their raids.  Sure....I could have joined, been twinked with full deepwater armor, wielding whatever flaming sword I chose...but at what cost? To join a guild that may or may not treat it's members more like a family and less like a number in the ranks of their "dragon army".<br>
<br>
I guess what all this longwindedness boils down to is this. All anyone needs to accomplish whatever it is they seek in this world are friends & family.<br>
<br>
* * * * * *<br>
<br>
The stance that those of us in Mystic have taken is this.....Those of us in our 30's that will be moving up want the rest of our family and friends to move up with us.  AND THE ONLY WAY to accomplish this is to stay and help.  Cultivate those that join our ranks to share the same beliefs as us....that family & friends & time spent together are more important than just about anything else there is.  <br>
<br>
WE may lose some to the temptations of greed, uber-loot and seeing a dragon before anyone else....but for those that think those things to be the most important - thank you for your time, you will always remain in our hearts and stay safe on your journey.  <br>
<br>
WE do not judge those that leave, we do not hold grudges.....but those that stay have something that those that leave do not....a family that they will grow with and share more important things with and a family that will stand by their sides no matter.<br>
<br>
When making your choices in the recruiting process....Choose well, cultivate & instill the ideals in the new recruits that have kept your family together.....and you shall once again grow in ranks and have a stronger family for it !<br>
<br>
* * * * * *<br>
<br>
Goklulot, Germania, Brastil, Sapphyire, Karthar & the others of the Benevolent Order - You have good hearts and a great core family surrounding you.  You will always be welcome amongst us and considered extended family.<br>
<br>
<and for those of you that fell asleep reading this....WAKE UP !><br>

<br>
  It isn't anywhere near as simple as you portray it. I have almost 90 days of played time on my primary alone. I think this qualifies me as having some limited insight into the game. <br>
<br>
  I have also been a B.O. member longer than any active member so I know a little of what I talk about.  <br>
<br>
  NO ONE that left B.O. betrayed it and I find it insulting that it would even be suggested. I was honored for the chance to group with any of them and still feel the same way. <br>
<br>
  Greed?  Disloyalty?  Belonging to a class that is dependant on groups I have experienced both many times. Rarely from a B.O. member. <br>
  As for myself I have made complete sets oF FS armor and every piece of jewelry that can be made and never charged more than cost of material, often giving it to other members for free. Every item I have obtained of any value that I could not myself use was given to another member for free. Often buying someting from Vendors just to give to another member. I don't think there was a person in this guild that spent more of their money on other guild members or more time Power Leveling others while getting no experience for themself than me. Though the title for most unselvishness for time given to help others would unquestionably go to Gokulot.<br>
<br>
    Yes, I agree that feeling you belong and are accepted as part of the family that is your guild is probably the most important consideration you will make. Just not convinced I feel that way any longer. I had joined hoping to have friends to group with regularly, that this would in fact be my EQ family. As it is, almost all my requests to group have been outside the guild. The requests I get from within the guild have been almost exclusively to make Jewelry, armor, help with a tradeskill or Power leveling.  There are many who are half my level or a quarter of my days played that have seen more of Norrath than I.     I wish to see those other areas. <br>
<br>
   Some good points have been raised. The most important of which being that you be made to feel a part of a family.  On that note please accept my resignation. I leave NOT because of some desire to obtain some uber item. I leave to find a family where I feel I belong. Something I have not felt in this guild for some time.  <br>
<br>
   I look forward to helping in anyway I can any who wish to still call on me as friend as I will still consider you. For any that considers me to be Disloyal and a Backstabber I wish you best of luck in your travels and hope only that you find happiness in what you seek. <br>
<br>
   As a final request I ask one thing. For those of you who are true members of the Benevolent Order, understand what it means, know what it once stood for and hopefully will continue to, to treat everyone, even those who you feel betrayed you, with benevolence. <br>

Edit-&gt;<br>
I need to further expand on this explanation, after having sometime to think on it.  The words I chose were not specific to anyone, but a very, very general example that may have used otherwise harsh words.  I currently do not know of ANYONE that has done this.  I hear stories of this sort of occurrance and this is what I would hate to see happen to us.  I want to foster the sort of environment in the guild that builds that sense of belonging and esprit.  I want all of our members, past, present, and future to feel that they are part of a continued family, regardless of if they are in the Order or not.  I hope this has erased the confusion that I have cause with my earlier post.  I tend to say things from the gut at times and often I set myself up for misinterpretation.  <br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>

<br>
I remember grouping with you at Gok's Lucan kill and I have seen first hand and heard of your generosity within your guild.  I wish not to see you leave the B.O. and I hope my comments have not stirred up emotions that have brought you to this decision.<br>
<br>
As ambassador, it is my job to keep B.O. informed of any and all activities that my guild schedules and to provide invitations to those events.  I also feel from time to time that being an ambassador revolves around providing insight, information or possible advice to situations that I have already experienced......this was one of them.<br>
<br>
I stated before that people leave guilds for many reasons.....some because their friends have, some - honestly - is for the loot, some- honestly - is for powerleveling or wanting to be in a guild that is on the dragon raid schedule....BUT not everyone leaves for these reasons, nor do they all stay for these reasons.<br>
<br>
NO ONE is labelled backstabber, thief, disloyal or whatever - we all have paths to follow and journeys to make.<br>
<br>
* * * * * *<br>
<br>
The reason i stepped in and offered advice was to possibly offer some insight on whole-sale recruiting......and that this could bring in people who see the opportunity to have that level 40+ class level them up and loot them up.....without concern for anything else...so then they could leave and then jump on the next PL train.<br>
<br>
NOT all people are like this...and my main point was once people are in the guild....act, hunt, treat & most importantly display your guild's virtues to them so they KNOW without a shadow of doubt that the guild is about family, good times, good hunting and so on.  Those that are not about this will inevitably leave.<br>
<br>
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY....no matter who stays or goes....they will always be considered family, friend and someone who once shared the same family name as you.....and because of that NO prejudices, NO hard feelings, NO unwelcomeness shall be shown to those that have left.<br>
<br>
* * * * * * *<br>
<br>
In no way do I put down those that seek uber-loot, want to PL or be PL'ed or those that seek to be in a "plane/dragon-able" guild.  For those that do....it is a choice, a path.  And yes......I will hunt a dragon or two in my time, I will make planar raids and have a blast.....my point on this is, I would rather do it with friends & family (no matter what guild tag flies over their head) than with people who I do not know, barely know or just treat me like paladin #xxx in their army.<br>
<br>
I hope I have cleared up some of my points......and if you wish me to muzzle myself (Snork keeps one on hand for just these occassions) and just stick to guild raid invite info...please tell me also !<br>

From reading the prior posts, I can already tell this is a commited guild, full of conviction and determination in keeping the flame of family alive. This is the type of guild I have been looking for. I can tell you I have been in a few others. With more than 15 people online at the same time...and no one talking. What a travesty and waste of a guild. I hope to help you all in any aspect that I might be of service. If I am ever online and you need my help, please do not hesitate to ask. I have recently moved up to the taxi-cab level (29) which enables me to port to certain locations. I will always make time to come and give you a ride if need be (of course, for free).  I hope to get to know you all and develope a long-standing relationship with you and the guild. Again...I'm glad to be aboard.<br>
