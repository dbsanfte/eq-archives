She glanced around and took a deep breath. She knew she couldn't just drop Evelyn off in Ephesus. And Gabrielle was sick. With all this going on and more obviously waiting for her back in Ephesus, Ari had to make a decision. Though she had known the answer for a while now, she had been avoiding it. But no more. Ari wouldn't be returning to fight in the war.<br>
<br>
She sighed and looked from Amazon to Amazon and couldn't help but wondered who she wouldn't be seeing again. The Saurians were strong, from what she could tell, and would not be easily defeated. Lives would be lost-both those of warriors and those of innocents, not fighting in the war.<br>
<br>
On that thought, her gaze drifted to Crystal and she walked over to her. &quot;I'm not coming back,&quot; She admitted and took a necklace off her head, then put it over Crystal's. &quot;Gabrielle gave this to me for protection. I want to give it to you...and the baby.&quot; She smiled softly and hugged her friend. The word friend was more of an understatement, too. More like sister.<br>
<br>
With that, she turned back to Evelyn and seated herself on the tiger now, too. &quot;Herete, Athelfi.&quot; And with that, they were off and back on their way to Ephesus. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> X AmazonTears X</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(8/30/01 3:05:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Saying goodbye</span><hr size=1> She held Ari tight for a few moments then stepped back. Fingers held the necklace which hung around her neck tight. She sauted her &quot; I`ll pray a swift and speedy return for you and the little Amazon.&quot; She smiled to the kid. &quot;Herete, Athelfi...LaTra&quot; <br>
<br>
She stood there for awhile watching them fade from sight. That may have been the last time she will speek to Ari. She sniffled alittle, keeping back the tears. She rubbed her belly softly. Wars can last a long time, if she gave birth, she would have her child sent swiftly back to Ari in Ephesus. Sighs, she came to help and help she will. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uchaoticgoddesseris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chaotic Goddess Eris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#993300>(8/30/01 3:44:16 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.dencity.com/gdessharmonia/discord/25.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> *Something wicked this ways come *</span><hr size=1> :: In a cloud of black smoke she appears, accompanied by a strong breeze that seems to flow around her and whomever she is close to. She scans the area of the camp, her usual smirk on her lips. She could tell which ones were the actual children on her brother and which ones werent. No wonder he liked to watch the Amazons...they were impressive...kind of anyway. Looking around she spotted Artemis and walked to her smiling. Oh how Eris did love a war....and the huge emotion of hate that went with it. She put her hands on her sides and just looked around.::<br>

She smiled lightly. Earlier that night she had a small conferance with Queen Alysia. Though the amazon gave no worship to the Gods, she still held her respect. Alysia was special to the Goddess like many of the Queens were. Hopefully, the council Athena gave the Queen would help her and her tribe.<br>
<br>
She, unlike her brother was more invollved in the basic issues and developments in the war, not the number of casulties it provided.<br>
<br>
She glanced lightly at Eris and Artemis and decided to speak with her elder sister.<br>
<br>
&quot;Artemis, may I have a word?&quot;<br>
<br>
(OOC: ArtemisMUN, please continue the talk with Athena and Artemis in either email or IM.
