&quot;Something has happened Yakut. Weeks ago Raven vanished from the lands. She spoke of darkness emerging and the death of peace.&quot; She looked clueless.<br>

&quot;Peace has died within bloodshed of innocent.&quot; She spoke almost as if dazing off.<br>
<br>
As they came closer they would see that she was scrubbing her wrists with rocks. &quot;I'll get them off if it kills me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Only Yakut would know what Raven was truly doing. She was trying to rid herself of the marks of Dakor. Tiny red dots that lined her wrists in a pattern of the Dark God. <br>
Her efforts were failing, and all she was doing was bleeding her hands.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't allow my tribe to fall.&quot;<br>
<br>
The peace that had died was Yakut. Raven knew in her heart what had happened. Yakut lost the innocence and Raven knew then that the Peace that the Valley once stood for would die . . . the only way Raven herself kept the peace was with Yakut's strength . . . and to her, that was now gone. Raven's darkness would soon emerge, and in her mind, it would destroy the tribe. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3F3F3F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamazonqueenyakut.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amazon Queen Yakut </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen</span><br>  Posts: 169<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(8/14/02 4:01:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=49.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Darkness....</span><hr size=1> Yakut went to the river and found her daughter Raven.

<br>
&quot;There is no such thing as peace . . . Not while darkness lives in the world.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked over and saw her step-mother and sisters along with another woman. This must be her Aunt Shy. She never met her, but since the rest of the family was all about the peace, she had a feeling that she wouldn't be liked much by her.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm the outcast. And while nothing is good in the world, I'm the only one who can protect us all.&quot;<br>
<br>
She finally realised this.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mother you need to return for good to us here. The tribe needs you. I'm not good at keeping the peace.&quot;<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, there was a sound comming loudly through the bushes. While Yakut's happy little family stood on the bank of the river, a large boar came charging at the little ones who stood short compared to the others.<br>
<br>
Raven's bright blue eyes flickered black momentarilly as her hand went outward towards the bank of the river. Dark light flew from the small dots on her wrist and just as the boar was about to hit her younger sisters, the light hit the beast tearing him to burnt pieces.

The Shamaness didn't know what to do.<br>
<br>
&quot;Raven, you are not an outcast. If anything I am the one who is a stranger among her own. How many Amazons bear no weapons? Hm? I mean evertyone is different. Tanna, Me, Glory, Ariel, Lynn, Shyriana....You are a True Amazon, its in your blood. I am your blood.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked to the shore where Tanna, her two daughters and twin sister Shyriana stood.<br>
<br>
&quot;They are apart of me, and you too. Wether or not you know it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Raven probably still had a &quot;thing&quot; with Christanna but Christanna is Ariel's blood mother and Yakut's wife.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have returned to Tanais River Valley, you, the Tribe to help you rule. I think that it would be good for you to..&quot; <br>
<br>
Yakut can't believe she's about to say this,<br>
<br>
 &quot;raise an Army and Protect the Valley. Be War Queen. I'll keep my peace and handle the domestic affairs. We can give Scynthia a rest from protecting us. They have enough problems of their own.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Shamaness sighed. Darkness would always plague her and her family but that's just life. Might suck but its life.<br>
<br>
&quot;And no matter what you say, Peace lives. Just not in the way you think....I love you and so does everyone on that shore.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looks over at the rest of her family. Family. Her hues return to Raven.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dakor might have taken away alot of things from you but he can never take your family away. Or your Amazon blood.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yakut would never give up on Raven or anyone in her family or the Amazon Nation for that fact. Yakut's dedication was strong and her love was even stronger.<br>
<br>
&quot;You see Raven...your one of us. Your my daughter, my family.&quot; <p>§-:¦:-§ Yakut §-:¦:-§ <BR>

She then paused looking down to the blankness of the fireplace and her wrists gently reached out causing a spark to set and a small fire to blaze.<br>
<br>
She took one more glance back to Glory and paused wondering what the child was thinking of. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3F3F3F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugloryoftrv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glory of TRV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(8/21/02 2:55:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=49.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Sister,sister</span><hr size=1> Glory skipped over to Raven and sat down beside her.<br>

She stopped the wagon cart and began unloading all the family's stuff. <br>
<br>
--------------------<br>
<br>
Night Time came, and by that time Yakut had unpacked all the stuff and stabled her horses. She had placed the wagon cart behind the stables for anyone to use.<br>
<br>
The Shamaness walked to the bon fire and sat down on the ground leaning back on the log.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hate re-unpacking.&quot;<br>

She had mumbled this to herself while staring into the flames. <p>§-:¦:-§ Yakut §-:¦:-§ <BR>

&quot;It depends. It used to hurt a lot when I was younger. But now it actually feels good. It kinda hurts when I don't use it.&quot;<br>

Ariel pursed her little lips, and tilted her head slightly at her oldest sister.  All she could really tell was that Raven hurt inside, but that was enough for the little goddess. <br>
<br>
She bounded over, and gave Raven the best hip hug she was capable of.<br>

She looks at Ariel as she hugged Raven and smiles.<br>
<br>
She kind of understood what Raven was saying,but didn't understand fully,she still had alot of things to learn.<br>
<br>
Then Glory got to thinking,and then stood up and also gave Raven a hug.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't think you should leave,Ravey.&quot; She looked at her older sister,and batted her lashes,a sad expression on her face.<br>
<br>
Sure she and Raven werent close,but Glory wanted to change that. She wanted one big happy family and an older sister to watch and admire. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uchristannagoddessofpeace.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Christanna Goddess of Peace</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 59<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(8/26/02 4:26:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=49.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/cristalc15/images/tanna3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> ( ::blinks as the mun knocks herself out of inactivity... yeah:: )<br>

Christanna watched and listened... and as Yakut went off to start unpacking, she made her way to the fire where Raven sat with Glory and Ariel. She figured she'd at least try to do something before going and helping Yakut.<br>
<br>
Kneeling down before Raven, she took both of her hands and kissed the inside of each wrist over the marks, then folded Raven's hands over her chest. &quot;Embrace it... we all have a dark side,&quot; she whispered softly, and then before a reaction could be given she stood and quickly went to their hut, walking up behind Yakut and putting her arms around her. &quot;Guess who?&quot; she said, nuzzling against her neck from behind. <p><html> <center> <font face="vivaldi" size="+1" color="#ffc0cb"> ~ Christanna : Amazon Goddess of Shamanism ~ <br> Proud wife to Yakut  and mother to Yakut's
