<br>
Zelia had slowly made her way onto Themiscryan Territory,not far from the main village. She looked alot better than she had looked before. Wearing new clothes;black leather pants,a white tube top,and of course,she was still not wearing any shoes. Her eyes had gone from a pale grey back to thier normal sea green,and even her hair was neatly brushed. <br>
<br>
As she stood on a hill that she could look down on the village,her heart pounded,she was acctually a tad scared,something she hadn't felt before unless she was dealing with 'him'. She takes a deep breath,and moves on.<br>
<br>
Walking toward the village,she looked around slightly,not really careing to keep her gaurd up. She now just looks ahead toward the village as she approaches it. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uiizeliaii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>II Zelia II</A> at: 12/13/01 12:31:22 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uarahutajiwarli.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arahuta Jiwarli</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.hometown.aol.com/arahutajiwarli/star-14.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Shamaness</span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#993300>(12/13/01 2:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=313.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/ararpg.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alive and going to try to make amends</span><hr size=1> The dark skinned amazon had only been back home for since early that morning.   But, in that time, she had already heard much of what had happened while she was away.  She saw the amazon Zelia walking towards the village.   Ara grew confused.  For she had been told that this amazon was killed during the war.  <br>
Whispers around her, as other's caught site of the amazon walking into Themiscrya quickly told Ara that this Zelia was in danger.  Without another moment's thought, Arahuta quickly walked up to Zelia and gave her a friendly smile and nod.  &quot;Athelfi, I know you do not know me.  But, I am Arahuta Jiwarli.  And,&quot; Ara looked around at those who were gathering to look at Zelia and then back to her. &quot; I think it would be best if you came with me.&quot;  <br>
Arahuta motioned to Zelia to follow her quickly and began walking to the Queen's hut.

The look of pure hatred and rage in her eyes. She did not like the situation growing, she should of burnt that body after she lapped the head off. Noone, NOONE should be permitted back into the nation or any village after the atrocities she had done during that war. Everyone had signed an oath never to harm a sister...harm or kill, DeL was a firm believer of sticking to an oath or promise, they are as good as givng your word. And if you break your word, you broke your honor in her eyes. She had promised Hippolyte she wouldnt attack this foul girl, that she would sit by and let the trial go underway...but she didnt like it. Zelia i not to be trusted in her eyes..not in the village, not i anyone' life, and definitly not in war..and DeL is going to see to it that she never fghts in any Amazonian war again.~ <br>

It was not that long ago, that Arahuta had seen those same looks from the Romans who had enslaved her.  The dark shamaness did her best to walk close to Zelia.  Even though, she was not sure what she would do if they attacked.  Ara felt she should protect this girl, until Hippolyte had seen her.  <br>
Leading Zelia to the Royal hut, she looked up to see DeLerium standing watching them approach.  Ara took a deep breath as they reached the steps leading up to the Queen's door.  She stopped and stood just to the side, but in front of Zelia.<br>
She lifted her hands up and saluted DeLerium in the amazon way she had learned from watching.  &quot;Princess DeLerium, we request a meeting with the Queen if possible.&quot;<br>
Arahuta was not about to push by DeLerium without permission.  As she stood there, Ara reached back and softly touched the top of Zelia's hand.  The shamaness could feel the tense fear that was riddling thru the amazon at her side and wanted to give her a least a bit of comfort.  But, she did not move her eyes from the Princess. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamazondelerium.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amazon DeLerium</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon</span><br>  Posts: 197<br> <font color=#993300>(12/13/01 10:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=313.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/deleriuml9/images/del2.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alive and going to try to make amends</span><hr size=1> ~ DeL's cold sea green eyes bore holes into  Zelia's head.

The soft touch from Arahuta did nothing to calm the fear and nervousness she was feeling. <br>
<br>
She looks around once more,trying to find a familiar face. The face of the only person who could calm her fears,but to no avail. She glances quickly to DeL then to Arahuta. she clasps her hands together and fidgets nervously.<br>
<br>
Zelia then looks quickly to the two gaurds on either side of her then looks to DeL as she called her a creature. A deep frown crosses her features. She began to breath a little heavier as her wrists were grabbed. She kepts her eyes on DeL as she spoke. Murderdous wench didn't hurt,but that creature comment did. She sighs then,and doesnt put up the slightest struggle.

She staggered forward,then fell on her knees. She sighs heavily as she looks around the small cell.<br>
<br>
Just as she heared Varias voice,she gets up quickly and turns around. &quot;Varia!&quot; She moves quickly to Varia,but the cells bars kept her from any close contact. &quot;I'm so happy to see you.&quot; She reaches a hand out through the bars to Varia. &quot;I didn't think you were gonna be here.&quot;<br>

She knew Zelia would have to be punished for what she'd done, she just hoped it wouldn't be exile.
