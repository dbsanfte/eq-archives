There she had spent a few days in the silent peace that she deserved, that allowed her to realize the regret she felt for killing Pobres. <br>
<br>
 She didn't love him, but he was a challenge for her, the one thing that made the Centuar war personal. Now he was gone, but the anger still filled most of her dark soul. <br>
<br>
 Returning later to the village, and to her hut. Weapons had been stored away under her bed, as well as her war mask. Leather attire had as well been changed, to celebrate the solstice, and Gamelia Festival.  <br>
<br>
 As Dawn stood in her doorway, arms crossed over the silver belly chain, and V shaped leather skirt. Yes, she as well wore her leather corsit. She couldn't help but frown, Dawn wasn't married and it seemed she really had nothing to celebrate. <br>
<br>
 There was Free, and she knew she was happy to have him in her life. She loved the man greatly he meant so much to her, it lightened the darkness in her soul. <br>
<br>
 Green eyes had watched Hippolyte, Gabby, and Theseus exit Themiscrya. She figured alot of Amazons would be leaving around this time. To celebrate with the families in their villages. Most had come to Themiscrya to fight and now was their time to return home. Celebrate a victory, and the happiness in their hearts. <br>
<br>
 Dawn cringed lightly, as her leather boots gently followed a trail from her hut, through the forest. Maybe now was a time to find Free. Afterall she had a victory to celebrate, as well as a war to prepare for. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=tiger4157>Tiger4157</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#993300>(12/22/00 2:42:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=115.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: -:I:- Gamelia Festival -:I:-</span><hr size=1> ::Sartha returns from the practice fields, Veran beside her. As she entered the village, she could see a happy Hippolyte, Gabby, and Theseus leave the village. She smiled slightly, then walked to her hut. As she entered, she sighed. She had nothing to celebrate this Solstice except the end of the war. The Gamelia Festival was only a pain in her soul, bringing memories of the vows She and Wolfen had once shared. He had broken those vows like nothing had ever existed between them. She sighed again and sat down in a chair, Veran jumping into her lap. She msiled at the pup and hugged him lightly. Her only company this winter would be the wolf pup, veyriean, and Valan, and Perhaps Anya if she allowed it. They were more in number than Sartha had ever had to stay with her at Solstice time before. The thought was slightly comforting, but still she couldn't help but feel empty, as she had felt for more than a hundred years now.&quot;<br>

::The pup yipped and licked her face and she chuckled lightly, stroking his soft puppy fur. She lightly brought her fingers up to the pendant at her neck. Perhaps something good could come of Solstice this year. She got to her feet and decided to find Donovan. He was always a comfort, no matter how clueless he could be at times. She unstrapped her sword and took her daggers from her boots, laying her staff to rest as well. This Solstice she would not carry her weapons.

She knew that Hippolyte and Gabrielle had left to celebrate Gamelia, and for that she was drowning in her own sorrow. Love in her life had been purely. Even her relationship with Iolaus had more downs than ups. She glanced over at Gabrielle who was by her side.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gabrielle, go and visit Joxer. You two should spend this day together.&quot; She smiled at her twin. <br>
<br>
She then glanced down at Eli who had come to visit her. Alysia had been keeping Fayla, Eli's daughter, safe during his absence and the Father and Daugter reunion was beautiful. She smiled to the two of them resting by her bed and remembered a time when she herself fell in love with the Peace Keeper.<br>
