After my recovery, I swore to find those bandits and to kill them and I quitted my qasatour.I got to the territory of the Sisters of the Crimson Stone to see my athelfi...and I found the village deserted and in ruins, killed by a warlord named Kiarus and his army.His army attacked me and after a fierce battle they made me their captive at their camp and wanted me to become their chief.A night, I found myself tied on a tree and Kiarus killed all the bandits who were loyal to me and decided to make peace with my Nation.He rode to Themiscrya to kill Hippolyte, my Vasilissa.Fortunately I was able to escape and went at his pursue.I overtook him north of Sarmatia and killed him in dual.Now I know that if there's still bandits of that band alive, they'll come to kill me.<br>

She had seen the amazons attack upon Iolaus and smiled softly until she spoke too much of the Amazons. After the amazon released Iolaus, Raven leaped down from a tree looking down upon them.<br>
<br>
She was perhaps the same age as the other amazon, but the hate and darkness in her eyes was far beyond the miles up Mount Olympus. She was a demi-goddess of a darkness far past the Eastern land called Chin. She was the Goddess of Pride.<br>
<br>
&quot;Athelfi!&quot; She called to the other amazon. &quot;You speak many words to this vev, perhaps giving away too much information when you do not know of his whereabouts.&quot;<br>
<br>
She passed by the other amazon and looked at the man.<br>
&quot;I've seen you before,&quot; she stated. &quot;You're the one who travels with the half God hero.&quot; Raven never called men by their names, only by what she saw them as.<br>
<br>
&quot;God worshipers are not liked by my tribe. I come from the Tanias River Valley.&quot;<br>
<br>
Northern Amazons, they did not worship the Gods. And Raven had a direct hatred for them. <br>
<br>
If Iolaus was smart enough to think of the location of Tanias Valley, he would know that it was directly next to Scynthia. Where LaTra Alysia ruled over. Perhaps that was his only way out of this situation.<br>

Raven smiled lightly as she saw that her actions were pleasing to Dawn. Raven had been taught the highest respect for her athelfi, especially those in authority, which Dawn was.<br>
<br>
She merely watched and listened as Dawn spoke. Raven marveled at Dawn's blades. She herself fancied her staff but was still handy with a sword.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dawn,&quot; She approached her smiling lightly. &quot;Is it true you are to be an instructor at the new academy?&quot;<br>
If the rumors were true, Raven was looking forward to these lessons. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#a62a2a><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 222<br> <font color=#660000>(7/14/01 4:44:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> . . . . . . *</span><hr size=1>  Dawn nodded, as she listened to Raven.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Yes, I am. Although I don't know how much help I'll be, not many want to learn assassination skills. But I did train Wulf, and he turned out okay.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn laughed lightly, Wulf had been her first trainee, since her past.  <br>
<br>
 Emeralds remained intent on Raven, although she was sensing every move made by the one on the ground. It was skills that were working with her senses, there wouldn't be a move the girl could pull. <p>

<br>
Who begun to shoot the insults!It just prove that what I said is true and that you act as if you have all rights!The right of life or death, the right of insulting me because I don't have any title of nobility and try to make my way and that if I retort you it'll be disrespect.I'll respect you if you respect me.I don't wanna fight you or be your rival, only to be respected as your athelfi.<br>
<br>
*She turns to Dawn and says*<br>
<br>
Don't be worried, I willn't go to the Orio Pata,at least as long as you'll be ruler there, cause you looks like to have a great aptitude to make yourself enemies and that I don't want to fight you.But as long as you'll treat me as if I worth nothing and disrespect me,I'll have no respect for you.You must earn my respect and be worthy of it, act for good and not for fame or to take power on others.I respect Queen Hippolyte cause she's worthy of respect but even if you protect her, if you continues to treat me as you do,you willn't earn my respect. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#a62a2a><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 224<br> <font color=#660000>(7/15/01 1:22:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: . . . . . . *</span><hr size=1>  Emeralds were cast back to Daphnike, flashing back to their normal hue. There was a plain solemn look on the Amazons face as she stared at her.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Athelfi you have just made an enemy. I don't want or need your respect. I am who I am, and I won't be dying any time soon. Then when I do.. I plan on leaving my tribe to a Northern Amazon. Get used to their ways.&quot;<br>
<br>
 It was surprising that Dawn hadn't raised a finger to this girl, but.. it wasn't ment to be done, yet. Then when she did.. it wouldn't be a finger.. <p>
