He has on battle garments, a golden helm with red plume feather over a wavy mass of brown hair, a gold and silver curaiss, golden shin guards with silk laces over his calves, a pair of golden sandles and slung over his right shoulder on its leather strap a round shield made of gold and bronze with pictures depicting the trojan war on it. He firmly grasps his golden trident in his right hand and the light from the flames glistens off its shaft. He stands before the gates of the deepest pit in all the world, Tartarus. Behind this gate and wall of bronze the titans are held in prison for punishment of their wicked deeds against the sons of Cronus. Poseidon walks up to the gate and puts his trident on the wall by his side. He lifts his hands to the bronze bars and holds on to them. Looking into the deep darkness there he can barely see a thing. He can however hear the moans of the the starving and uncomfortable titans, his uncles and cousins. After a while humanoid shapes become clear. He sees the Titans still held with their adamantine chains, bound by both arms and legs. He remembers the long trek of bringing them here after their defeat. They could never escape here and Poseidon looks to his left where he sees off in the not too far distance the hundred-handed giants talking to one another. They see him and wave to him, Poseidon waves back to them and looks back through the bars of the gate.::<br>
<br>
'Cousins and uncles it is I, Poseidon. Too bad for you that you've had to spend all these centuries in torment. I don't believe Zeus will have any mercy on you and let you free.'<br>
<br>
::As Poseidon laughs at them and his little joke the Titans roar with anger and Hades begins to shake as if struck by earthquakes. The rattle of the chains and stomping of the Titans feet is heard. Poseidon backs up, a little shaken by their reaction. He looks to the Hecatonchires to assure them everything is ok. Walking back to the gate Poseidon picks up his trident in his right hand and stands there just looking hard into the chamber fixed for the Titans.:: <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uposeidonkofc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poseidonkofc</A> at: 7/23/01 4:26:40 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=thegoddesshecate>The Goddess Hecate</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicon/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(7/23/01 3:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=117.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Change of mood...</span><hr size=1> in a burst f black smok Hecate appears with a black fitted gown on with matching eyemakeup her blackeyes reflecing the flames and her dark lips curved into a smile as she walks to Persephone<br>
