The panther still asleep at the foot of the bed sofly purring away.  She sits up and puts one foot down on the floor at a time, she feels a hand underneith her foot right before she stands, she looks down and finds Lalita and Theseus passed out on the floor.  <br>
<br>
The smell of liquor is strong on both of their breath.  Lalita is belly down on the floor, her left arm tucked under face, her legs staggered out, she didnt even remove her boots.  Theseus is lying next to Lalita in the fetal position with his back facing her.  He has one boot on and the other was kicked across the floor, his pants still on but shirt was off tucked under his head.  <br>
<br>
She slides out of her bed and kneels down next to them on the floor.  She tries to wake the two of them up by putting one hand on each of their shoulders and lightly shaking them, &quot;Guys wake up, its past noon.&quot;  Slowly the panther wakes up and walks over and starts licking Lalita's face to try to help Celaneo get them up.  They both just kinda groan, refusing to get up.  <br>
<br>
Celaneo gets a little anxious, and starts to think of the best way to get them up.  First she thinks of dumping water on them, but the last time she did that to Lalita, she almost knocked her unconscious.  She arches her brow and smiles mischevously, she blurts out, &quot;Guys, Hippolyte is at the door.&quot;  Knowing good and well Hippolyte is no where near the hut.  The girl just wanted to see if they would get up faster, and of course see their reaction. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=celaneo@amazonsunite>Celaneo</A> at: 5/27/03 6:43:51 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lalitasilver@amazonsunite>Lalita Silver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#993300>(5/27/03 7:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=488.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Waking Theseus and Lalita up</span><hr size=1> Groans, swearing that she'll be good and never drink another Grave Digger, if the Gods would just take away her hangover, or better yet, just strike her dead right then and there. Of course nothing happens and she swats at the panther who then swats back at her. However hearing Celaneo announce that Hippolyte is there, she jumps up onto her feet and opens two red blood shot eyes. Her hands goes straight to her head and she sits right back down, with another groan. Seeing that Hippolyte is not even near the door, she closes her eyes for a long moment, and then stands slowly, and looks at Celaneo. &quot;When I feel better so help me little sister,&quot; she warns knowing its not extremely intimidating, she puts one hand on the bed near her and slowly pushes herself up to stand. Being unsteady on her feet she widens her stance and looks down at poor Theseus, &quot;Didn't have a chance I suppose, strong drinks they serve,&quot; she shakes her head a bit and instantly wishes she hadn't. &quot;Gods, my head,&quot; she says in a higher pitched voice then normal, she clears her voice and looks at Celaneo again, &quot;Water, for the love of all that is holy give me some hot water, please.&quot; She looks down at her self, again dusty from sleeping on the ground, &quot;And then I need to clean up again, I can't meet the Queen like this,&quot; sighs a little bit and rubs her temples. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=celaneo@amazonsunite>Celaneo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#993300>(5/27/03 7:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=488.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/celaneo/cel.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Waking Theseus and Lalita up</span><hr size=1> She starts to laugh at Lalita's reaction, &quot;I'm sorry, but i couldnt resist!!!.&quot;  She continues to laugh as she is getting some ice water and as she hands it to Lalita, she snorts, &quot;Did you see the look on your face! it was classic!!!&quot;  <br>
<br>
Looks to Theseus, seeing hes not quite awake yet, and blurts out, &quot;Yo Thes, your mom Hippolyte is here!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
She stands back waiting for a response.  Hoping Lalita doesnt grab her by the hair and toss her across the room for such a prank.

 Rubbing her head still she walks around Theseus and hunts for her bag of herbs to put into hot water, needing to kill off her hangover for a little while.

<br>
Looking to Theseus with a curious look on her face, &quot;Score with Xena?  What were you playing a game of polo or something?&quot;  She then slides off the bed still topless, and turns to Lalita, &quot;Thanks alot, you ruined my only shirt!, now what do i wear?&quot;  <br>
<br>
Goes over to the counter and pours herself a glass of water and takes a sip.  She looks at the two of them with a dumbfounded look on their faces, &quot;What? why are you looking at me like that?&quot;  <br>
<br>
She then squashes her boobs together, &quot;hey lalita, are these things getting bigger?&quot;  She turns to Theseus, and squashes them again, &quot;Is this normal?&quot; Just as she squashes them a little milk squirts out and hits Theseus straight in the eye.  She squints, &quot;whoops sorry, didnt know these things were like water guns.&quot;  Then bites her lip look at the two of them.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=celaneo@amazonsunite>Celaneo</A> at: 5/27/03 8:38:35 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theseusofthemiscrya>Theseus of Themiscrya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#993300>(5/27/03 8:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=488.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/ixltheseuslxl/myhomepage/theseus1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> In the Lion's Den?</span><hr size=1> Theseus blinked at being squirted.

After Theseus gets handed the sweater, she looks at Lalita drinking her tea, and then gets a cup of her own and sits down.

 &quot;There are certain times and certain places for things.

She studders and fumbles her words trying to find the right thing to say, afraid she'll get yelled at again, or worse, slapped.  &quot;I'm sorry, i didnt mean to make anyone feel uncomfortable, but when my mom was around it was a totally natural thing.&quot;  She pauses for a second and sighs, and the continues to explain herself, &quot;My mom always said never be ashamed of who you are.... and...... well.....&quot;, she stops for a moment, &quot;well i used to catch her with her shirt off all the time, and it didnt bother her....&quot; <br>
<br>
She picks up her cup of tea and takes a sip, &quot;Well Theseus took off his shirt outside while helping me build this hut, why is it ok for him and not for me?&quot;  She straight up wanting to know why the double standard, &quot;I was present, when he did this, I saw his bare chest... so why is it wrong for me and not for him?&quot;  She starts building up her confidence and a sterness grows in her young voice, &quot;So what hes a male, and yeah im a female.. what makes him so privalged, hes a male and we're amazons, we usually crush his kind dont we?&quot; <br>
<br>
She takes a breath and lightens her tone, &quot;Not that i would want him crushed or anything... but my point is, what is the big deal.......&quot;  She looks at lalita with this bright look on her face, &quot;My mother told me once, that his kind are inferior and do not rule us, she said never be ashamed and never hide, that we stand out above the rest......&quot;  She takes a breath and gets up from her seat and goes to the mirror to brush her hair.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lalitasilver@amazonsunite>Lalita Silver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#993300>(5/30/03 2:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=488.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> A lesson</span><hr size=1> She listens to Celaneo, and part of her is proud at what the young woman says, but that part of her that is a stickler for manners is still very much in the front. She pauses for a moment then sighs a little bit and replies to her, &quot;Easy little sister, your mother was, is right, but my point is different. Did it make you feel uncomfortable when he took off his shirt? Did it bother you? He was uncomfortable when you had no shirt on, it's not polite nor is it fair to make someone, even if you think they are lesser then you, feel uncomfortable. It is wrong to make them feel shame or embarrassment simply because you can. We are a strong people, we should never hide who or what we are but there are certain rules we must go by so that we have peace with others.&quot; She pauses for a moment, then continues on, &quot;Perhaps it is because I was raised differently then you, and I have had more dealings with males then you, but I have not seen them as less, we are equals in many ways. In some ways we are not equal, one gender is created to do tasks simply a little better then the other. Women can bear great pain that would kill most men. Some men can lift greet trunks of trees or lift very heavy things it would take two women to lift. We are different, yes but we are still equals.&quot; She stops and then goes to the girl, and kneels in front of Celaneo so that she may look her in the eye, &quot;I have no shame of my body or in the body of anyone. If you want to go without a shirt that is fine, it is your business and your right. I only ask that you wait, until we go back home. We must be polite while we are here, and causing someone undue stress and discomfort because we can is not right.&quot; She pauses so that her words will sink in to the girl, &quot;I am proud of you, Celaneo, do not think otherwise, but you still have many things...that you must learn or at least understand. Do you understand what I am saying?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vasilissadelerium>Vasilissa De Lerium</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Vasilissa Apo Themiscrya</span><br>  Posts: 133<br> <font color=#993300>(5/31/03 7:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=488.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/deleriuml9/images/del2.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A lesson</span><hr size=1> :: As DeL was walking her early afternoon rounds, she came up upon Cel's hut, she stopped dead in her tracks as she saw Theseus walk out  his hair tosseled,afterall, it was rather early in the day.
