She was a gift the ancients sent to her mother, sense Oreithyia had fled form her Amazon tribe.  Thalestris was raised in the way of the warrior, the only way her mother knew.  And it wasn't until she had entered puberty that her mother told Thalestris the truth about her.  Thalestris was told that her mother was born into a what-is-now dead Amazon tribe.  She was the heir to being Queen, but one unfortunate night, her tribe was destroyed.  Oreithyia was one of the only women that were able to escape.  Three years later, after settling down in a small Mediterranean forest, she was visited in her dreams by the Ancients.  They told her that she would be given one more chance for her blood to be amongst the Amazon Lands, and it would be through a new born child.  With accepting the gift her mother, Oreithyia, gave birth to Thalestris.<br>
<br>
At first Thalestris was stubborn about leaving her mother.  But on her 16th birthday, she was forced by Oreithyia, to begin her travels to be among her own kind.  With many tears and a giant feast amongst the two generations, she departed on her war mare, Belletayn which was named after the pagan ritual that takes place on her birthday.  So now she travels the Amazon Nation, as the Amazon Thalestris-Oreithyia.<br>
<br>
One more thing, many say she looks very similar to the Warrior Princess Xena...but she doesn't see it.
