<br>
Althought Hera was a goddess of both marraige and childbirth, sh enever had a happy or peacefull marriage. Zeus continued to have love affairs with Goddesse's, Nymphs, and mortals long after he married Hera, much to her chagrin.<br>
<br>
A full accounting of his conquests would humble Don Juan- or even Walt Chamberlin. The list of trysts included, amoung many, and many others:<br>
<br>
<br>
Maia: a Pleiad ( daughter of Atlas ) , by whom he fathered Hermes<br>
<br>
Electra: another Pleiad, with whom he conceived Dardanus<br>
<br>
Taygete: a third Pleiad, with whom he concieved Lacedaemon<br>
<br>
Semele: a mortal, who gave birth to Dionysus<br>
<br>
Alcmene, another mortal, who became the mother of Heracles.<br>
<br>
Danae, the mother of Perseus<br>
<br>
Leda: by whom he fathered Helen and Polydeuces<br>
<br>
Zeus also had dalliances with boys, the most notable of which was Ganymede, a beautiful young trojan whom Zeus abducted to become his cup-bearer.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, this parade of paramours caused quite a bit of marital tension between the King and Queen of Heaven. Hera was understandably jealous of all of her husbands infidelities. The Goddess had a violent temper, and Zeus roused her fury more then once with his incessant seductions.<br>
<br>
The scorned Goddess poured most of her energy into pursuing, punishing, and persecuting her husbands mistresses and basterd children.:<br>
<br>
She tried to prevent Leto from giving birth even though that affair had come BEFORE his marriage<br>
<br>
She sent a relentless gadfly to tourment the mortal Io after Zeus had changed her into a cow.<br>
<br>
She provoked Artemis into shooting and killing Callisto, whom Zeus had transformed into a bear.<br>
<br>
She killed nearly all the inhabitants of the island named after Aegina ( though Zeus later repopulated the island by transforming ants into people )<br>
<br>
She goaded Semele into making a request to Zeus that ultimitly destroyed her.<br>
<br>
She relentlessly persecuted Zeus's mortal son, Heracles, who rose to immortal staus in spite of her.<br>
<br>
Jealousy was not the only emotion that could rouse Hera's anger. The goddess was also extremely competitive about her beauty. When Side, the the first wife of the great hunter Orion, boasted that she was more beautiful then Hera, the goddess immediatly sent her to Hades. And when Paris of Troy claimed Aphrodite the fairest of the goddesses, Hera naturally took the side of the Greeks in the trojan that followed. Zeus forbade divine interfearance in this conflict.Yet despite this prohabition, Hera once seduced her husband, distracting his attention so that Poseidon could incite the Greeks to attack the Trojans.<br>
<br>
Zeus and Hera once again argued about whether men or women derived greater pleasure from the act of making love. Each insisted that the other's gender reaped the greater share of pleasure. The great Seer Teiresias, called in to decide the matter, insisted that a woman's pleasure was nine times that of a man. Infuriated, Hera immediatly blinded the seer.<br>

For just as Zeus ruled the Sky. Poseidon was lord of the seas and hades was supream authority in the dark underworld.<br>
<br>
TURF WARS.<br>
<br>
Poseidon, who wn the right to rule to seas, was also god of horses and earth-quakes. Poseidon's domain actually extended beyond the oceans to include freshwater rivers, even though the river gods were sons of Oceanus and Tethys.<br>
<br>
Mythmakers often depict Poseidon as gruff and quick to anger. He sometimes resented the greater dominion of Zeus. Perhaps for this reason, Poseidon lived not in Olympus, but in an underwater palace off the eastern coast of Greece.<br>
<br>
His subordinate position to Zeus made him sensitive about his other rights. Poseidon got into more fights over city patronage then any other Olympian. He contested the patronage of Argos with Hera and the patronage of Corinth with Helius. Poseidon lost both disputes and had to content himself with the patronage of various islands and seaports.<br>
<br>
The most famous of these disputes was the fight over Athens with Athena. Poseidon claimed teh land by plunging his trident into the ground of the acropolis and creating a salt water spring. But Athena later planted the first olive tree besides the well and claimed the city as her own. Poseidon immediatly challenged her to combat, but Zeus intervened and put the matter before the divine tribunal. Wishing to remain neutral on both sides and above the fray, Zeus did not vote. That left four other gods, who all voted for Poseidon. ( Hades,as was his custom, did not attend the Olympian hearing ) The five goddesses, however, all sided with Athena, giving her the right to the land by virtue of her greater gift to the city.<br>
<br>
Ina  fury, Poseidon flooded the Attic plain. The Athenians adopted several measures to appease Poseidons wrath. The city denied the women of Athens the right to vote. It ended the practise of men carrying on thier mothers names. And all Athenians continued to honor both Poseidon and Athena on the Acropolis. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugoddessartemis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goddess Artemis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 185<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(9/30/01 3:51:00 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/mogoddessartemis/images/triplemoon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Beastly Couplings, Beastly Children:</span><hr size=1> Poseidon courted Amphitrite, one of the Nereids ( daughter of Nereus, the Old Man of the sea ). Yet Amphitrite scorned the god's advances and fled to the Atlas Mountains. Poseidon refused to give up and sent messangers after her to plead his case. One of these, Delphinus, argued so persuasively for his master that he broke down Amphitrite's resistance. She agreed to marry Poseidon. ( The god later showed his gratitude by placing his messanger's image in the sky known as a constellation: the Dolphin. )<br>
<br>
Like his brother Zeus, however, Poseidon was not exactly th poster boy for fidelity. He too had numerous affairs with goddesses, nymphs, and mortals. Like most sea gods, Poseidon had the power to transform his shape, and often did so in order to complete a seduction:<br>
<br>
He appeared to the maiden Medusa as a bird. Unfortunitly, he chose as the setting for this seduction one of Athena's temples. The enraged Goddess punished Medusa by turning her into a Gorgon.<br>
<br>
To mate with Theophane, whom he had changed into a ewe in order to hide her from her many suitors, he transformed himself into a ram.<br>
<br>
When Demeter, overwhelmed by the loss of her daughter Persephone, attempted to escape he rbrothers attentions by changing herself into a mare, Poseidon was not fooled. He changed himself into a stallion and mated with her in an Arcadian pasture.<br>
<br>
Poseidon also mated in the shape of a Dolphin and a bull. These many transformations had a powerful influence on his offspring too:<br>
<br>
Medusa's children were the winged horse Pegasus and the giant warrior Chysaor.<br>
<br>
His union with Theophane produced the famous golden fleeced ram<br>
<br>
Demeter had two children by him: the nymph Despoena and a wild and remarkable horse named Arion.<br>
<br>
Many of his children were giants, including Chrysaor , the cyclopes Polyphemus, and the trouble making brothers Otus and Ephialtes.<br>
<br>
As a father, Poseidon was very protective , not only towards his three children by Amphitrite, but towards the children of his many mistresses, too. Poseidon made his son Cycnus invulnerable to weapons. He helped Theseus prove his parantage in a bragging contest with King Minos of Crete. And he avenged the blinding of Polyphemus by tourmenting Odysseus for 10 years.<br>
<br>
Perhaps because he mated witha  goddess in that form, the horse became sacred to Poseidon. Some storytellers insisted that he invented the horse by smashing his trident down upon a rock. In any case, it is said that he invented horse racing and perhaps the bridle as well. Whereever he went, he rode in a gold chariot drawn by two magnificant white horses with golden mares and brass hooves. <p>Goddess Artemis

In most part, he remain out of touch with the Olympians and Earth, learning of events there only when someone invoked his name in oaths and curses. He seldom met with other gods and goddesses on Olympus. And unless moved by lust, he rarely left the Underworld for the common ground of earth.<br>
<br>
Hades became as absolute am authority in the Underworld as Zeus was in the sky. Fiercly protective of his own rights, he claimed ownership of all metals and gems below the surfce of the earth.<br>
<br>
The most private of all the gods, Hades did not welcome " visitors" and rarely let anyone who entered the Underworld leave again. Cerberus, a vicious three headed watchdog, stood guard at the locked gate, making sure the dead remained in the Underworld.<br>
For this reason, men feared and loathed the fierce lord of the Underworld. Indeed, he became so closely associated with the darkness and horrors of the underworld that itself eventually came to be called Hades.<br>
<br>
Yet Hades, though cold and grim, was neither vicious nor evil.<br>
True, he oversaw all the punishments of the dead mandated by the gods, but most of these toutures were carried out by the Erinyes ( Furies ) In lording over the dead, he was simply doing his job. Noneetheless, mortals were reluctant to speak hi sname ( or his somewhat longer title, Aidoneus, the "Unseen one " ) for fear of attracting his attention. <p>Goddess Artemis

The original Olympian Goddesses assumed " traditional" female responcibilities derived from the functions of ancient earth goddesses. hera protected marriage and childbirth, Hestia guarded the hearth and home, and Demeter promoted fertility and the harvest. Since these functions played no small role in the earthly lives of mortal men and women, the Greeks ( and later Romans ) showed them great reverence. The available ancient literature on mythology and religious practices- written exclusivly by male authors- offers us a few tales about Demeter and Hestia. However, other relics of antiquity-artifacts, griffiti, place names, and so on- provide strong evidence that women in particular directed there religious practises and daily worship primarily toward female deities. <p>Goddess Artemis

As goddess of the hearth and fire-the symbolic center of the home- Hestia watched over the home, household activities, and the family. Indeed, sonme storytellers assert that Hestia herself invented the art of building houses. By extension, she also protected teh community, the civic affairs of the communal family.<br>
<br>
Unlike most other gods and goddesses, Hestia had few shrines built to honor her. But she needed none, for every home was her shrine-as well as the public hearth of every city. Suppliants could seek her protection in any private home  or in the city hall.<br>
<br>
The goddess of the home and family never had a family of her own. At one time, both Poseidon and the younger god Apollo pursued her, and the competition for her favor threatened to get ugly. But her supreme dedication to peace never allowed Hestia to take part in wars, rivalries, or other disputes. So in order to maintain peace on Olympus, Hestia turned down both rivals and sword by Zeus's head to maintain her chastity forever. Thereafter she withstood all amourus advances by gods, Titans, and mortals alike. Zeus rewarded her for this sacrifice by guaranteeing her the honor of recieveing the first portion of every public sacrifice. <p>Goddess Artemis

The goddess of the harvest, earth and fertility. Demeter persided over all crops, but especially grains. ( For some reason , she was not fond of beans, regarding them as impure. )<br>
<br>
Like her sister Hestia, Demeter never married, but she did have several love affairs. With her first love Zeus, Demeter had two children, a daughter named Kore ( later called Persephone ): and a son, Iacchus.<br>
<br>
At the marriage of Ares's daughter Harmonia and Cadmus, the first King of Thebes, Demeter fell in love for the second time: with brides brother, Iasion, a Titan. The couple lay together in a thrice-plowed field. But when the lovers returned tot eh weeding feast, Zeus spotted the mud on thier arms and legs and jealously killed Iasion on the spot with a thunderbolt. Her child by Iasion, Plutus, would become the god of the earths wealth.<br>
<br>
For most part, Demeter was gently and mild. Very rarely however, she exploded with anger. Her most notible outburst of anger came in the wake of her daughter Persephone's abduction by Hades. In her thirst for vengance-and her sorrow-Demeter made the earth barren, forbidding tree's to blossom and crops to grow and creating a year-long famine.<br>
<br>
Even in teh throes of despair, however, Demeter responded to kindness with kindness and generocity of her own. In the midst of her search for her daughter. The daughters of Celeus, king of Eleusis, invited Demeter - who was disguesed as an old woman- to stay in thier palace. In return for this kindness, Demeter schooled Celeus and the Eleusinians in the religious rites in her honor that came to be known as the Eleusinian Mysteries-the most widespread and influential of all Greek religious rites.<br>
<br>
Queen Meteneira offered Demeter a place in her home, asking the old woman to serve as her sons nurse. Demeter adored the young boy, Demophon, and - due to her gratitude to his parents and he rlove for the boy-wanted to give teh gift of immortality. But Meteneira was horrified to discover teh old woman in the act of laying the baby on the embers at night to smoother out his mortality. As a result, Demeter never got the chance to complete the rite.<br>
<br>
Demeter also rewarded Triptolemus, an Eleusinian ( perhaps another son of Celeus ) who gave her the first clue to her daughters wearabouts. Thanks to him, Demeter taught him the art of agriculture. She then sent him throughout the world with seed corn, a wooden plough, and her dragon-drawn cahriot to sow these lessons everywhere. <p>Goddess Artemis

After swallowing Metis, Zeus did not give a second thought to his child by her. But one day as he walked along the shore of Lake Tritonis, Zeus was suddenly racked with a splitting headach. He suffered from such pain that he roared in agony.<br>
<br>
Unable to bear the pain, Zeus called upon either Hephaestus or Prometheus, who brought  an ax down upon his head, splitting open his skull. Dressed in full armour, an adult Athena emerged from her father's head with a shout that echoed throughout the world.<br>
<br>
The borth of Athena completed the evolution from a mother-dominated mythology to one dominated by a supream patriach: Zeus. Though two generations, mothers had controlled the power structure of the immortals. In leauge with thier sons, these mothers had toppled thier mates. First Gaia had conspired with her son Cronus to castrate Uranus. Next Rhea-with Gaia's help-had saved her son Zeus in order to overthrow Cronus.<br>
<br>
Zeus ended this pattern, however, by swallowing Metis and the unborn Athena. In appropriating the female function of giving birth, Zeus ended the line of female supremecy. For Athena, born out of Zeus's head, owed no loyalty to any mother.<br>

What is it good for?</span><hr size=1> The goddess of war, unlike her half brother Ares, god of war, had little taste for blood. Though often depicted in full armour-helmeted, with spear and shield- Athena derived more pleasure from peaceful resolutions of disputes then from battle. In keeping with her aversions to bloodlust, Athena was also merciful. When seated on teh tribunal that tried Orestes for murdering his mother after she had murdered his father, for example, Athena voted for aquittal.<br>
<br>
Though she shunned warfare, however, when forced into battle, she proved nearly invincible. A brilliant strategist, she twice defeated the war god Ares on the battlefield. She also was a dominant force in the war with the giants.<br>
<br>
The goddess of both war and wisdom often awarded those who demonstrated bravery or ingenuity. For instance, she helped Perseus ( anothe rchild of Zeus ) kill the Gorgon Medusa. Afterward, she proudly displayed teh ehad of teh Gorgon in the center of her shield.<br>
<br>
Athena also acted as Odysseus's speacial protector. When the hero finally arrived back home in Ithaca after 20 years, Athena-though in disguise-appeared to greet him. Odysseus returned the favor of her deceit by lying about who he was. With a laugh, Athena revealed her true identity and admitted that her and Odysseus were two of a kind, shrewed liars both. <p>Goddess Artemis

During the Trojan War, however, she experianced a close call.<br>
<br>
Athena needed both armour and weapons, for she went without them except when in battle. So she asked Hephaestus to forge some for her, which he gladly offered as a labor of love.<br>
<br>
Athena apparently didn't appreciate the import of these words. When she entered teh shop to check on his progress, Hephaestus-normally deferential towards the goddesses-attacked her. Poseidon had apparently played a trick on him, telling the smith god that Athena yearned for him to make passionate love to her.<br>
<br>
Athena quickly pulled her self away from her attacker, but Hephaestus could not stop himself: His seed spilled out onto her thigh. Athena, greatly offended, took some wool and wiped off teh god's semen.<br>
<br>
Whens he tossed teh wool to the ground however, she unwittlingly fertilized Gaia. The earth goddess-disgusted by this tale of violation-disavowed any responcibility for the offspring of this misadventure. So Athena vowed to care for the baby herself. The infant, Erichthonius, would grow up to become the first king of Athens to worship Athena. <p>Goddess Artemis

Start with Zeus, who fathered 5 Olympians-with four different mates! Add Hera, the archetypal jealous wife, constantly trying to catch her husband and plotting against his mistresses and his children by them. Don't forget the sibling rivalry between the three brothers-or that Hera's sister Demeter also slept with Zeus.<br>
<br>
The second generation Olympians was not exempt from participating in this soap opera. Hermes would steal from his half-brother Apollo. Hephaestus would immobilize his mother Hera. And Aphrodite would make love to no less then 4 of the six gods on Olympus. Naturally, this created some tension-especially between her and her husband, Hephaestus. <p>Goddess Artemis

Sadly, the child, Hephaestus, was born sickly and lame. Hera, disgusted and embarassed by her creation, thre the child out of heaven. Hephaestus landed on teh greek island of Lemnos, where he worked at his craft and became a briliant artsian. <p>Goddess Artemis

Hephaestus was not hoping to win he rfavor, however, but rather to punish her for the ill treatment of him. As soon as she sat in it, teh chair held her tight.<br>
<br>
The Gods and Goddesses pleaded with Hephaestus to forgive his mother and even invited the exile back to Olympus. Still he would not release her. Finally, Dionysus got Hephaestus drunk and persuaded him to let his mother go.<br>
<br>
Welcomed back to Olympus, Hephaestus quickly made himself indispensable. An ingenious artist and artisan, he created countless beautiful , intricate, and often indestructable objects. The hands of Hephaestus created ( amoung many other works) :<br>
<br>
All the palaces of the Olympian gods<br>
<br>
The shield of Achillies<br>
<br>
Pandora, the first woman<br>
<br>
Some say that he constructed many mechanical creatures of gold-including the worlds first robots!- to help him with his work. He also built three legged tables with golden wheels that moved themselves around his workshop. Whenever the Olympians met, these wondourus table would run to the meeting place and then run back again afterward. <p>Goddess Artemis

But Ares quickly became the ost hated amoung the gods. All immortals loathed him, with three exceptions:<br>
<br>
Eris, goddess of discord < Some storytellers say Eris was twin sister of Ares >, appreciated the way he took her work to a new level.<br>
<br>
Hades didn't necessarily like Ares, but recogonized that he was good for business in the Underworld.<br>
<br>
Aphrodite loved him<br>
<br>
Treu, Ares was brave and strong-but he was also argumentive, impulsive, bloodthirsty, and destructive. In conflicts, the god of war chose sides capriciously and sometimes even switched sides in the middle of a war. Ares simply took pleasure in the bloodshed, slaughter, and wanton destruction of war.<br>
<br>
Ironically, teh god of war was not so skillful as a warrior:<br>
<br>
Level headed, disciplined Athena bested him twice.<br>
<br>
Otus and Ephialtes, the giant sons of Poseidon, also defeated him. Indeed, they humiliated him, trapping him inside a bronze jar  for over a year before Hermes manged to set him free.<br>
<br>
Heracles knocked the god of war off his feet four times in a single battle and ultimatly forced him to flee from the battle field.<br>
<br>
Diomedes stabbed him witha  spear and sent him running from the battlefield outside Troy.<br>
<br>
Ares never married, but he fathered dozens of children with both mortals and immortals. The most notable of these many mistresses was teh goddess of love: Aphrodite. <p>Goddess Artemis

She rose from the sea foam created when Cronus-the father of the Olympians-threw Uranus's severed genitals into the sea.<br>
<br>
The Goddess of love, lust, and mating never had to do a bit of work. Indeed, she had no other responcibility but to make love-and that, she did with abandon.<br>
<br>
Aphrodire, who possessed a magicgirdle that made its wearer an object of desire for everyone who saw her, was always happy to help young lovers. She took particular delight in causing her fellow Olympians to fall in love with mortals.<br>
 ( Zeus paid her back in kind by making her fall in love with the mortal Anchises-and concieve the hero Aeneas )<br>
<br>
Like the other gods and goddesses, however, Aphrodite also harshly punished those who refused to honor her properly.<br>
( In this case, it meant celibats or others who withstood the pleasures of love.)<br>
Hippolytus was just one of the mortals whom Aphrodite punished for denying himself of erotic joys. <p>Goddess Artemis

Zeus, Aphrodite's adoptive father, agreed. Unsurprisingly, the marriage of the enchantingly beautiful, sensual, and insatiable Aphrodite and the powerful, but gruff, ugly, and lame Hephaestus was not a happy one. Aphrodite could not confine her love to just one other. The goddess did not remain faithful to Hephaestus-not by a long shot. She had countless affairs with both gods and mortals.<br>
<br>
The most long-standing and significant of all of Aphrodite's lovers was Ares. But one night, the lovers tarried too long together. As Helius hitched up his golden chariot of the sun, he saw the lovers in Ares's palace in Thrace.<br>
<br>
When Helius told Hephaestus what he had seen, the smith god formed an unbreakable bronze net and secretly attached it to the posts and side of his bed. Then he bid aphrodite adieu, saying he was going to relax on Lemnos for a while.<br>
<br>
Of course, as soon as he had gone, Aphrodite sent for Ares. When the morning came, Hephaestus walked in, and found the two ensnared in the net. The cuckolded god quickly gathered all the other gods at his bedside to witness the shame of the naked and helpless couple and to heap ridiclue upon them.<br>
<br>
Hephaestus then demanded the return of the marriage gifts he had given to Zeus. But the ruler of the gods refused, calling the adultery a marital dispute and ridiculing Hephaestus as a fool fo rmaking it a public spectable.<br>
 ( Hermes and Apollo snickered that they would gladly make such a public spectacle if it meant lying with Aphrodite. )<br>
<br>
With his first glance at the nakid goddess, Poseidon fell in love with her. So the sea god suggested that Ares should pay for the marriage gifts, Poseidon gladly offered to serve as guarantor: If Ares defaulted on the payment, Poseidon would play the price and take Aphrodite as his own wife. Ares did ultimatly default on the debt, but Hephaestus-still smitten with his wife-did not really want a divorce at all, so he never brought it up again.<br>
<br>
Poseidon, however, was not that only god to envy Ares's position. Hermes too fell in love with naked Aphrodite. But when Aphrodite spurned his advances, Hermes sought the help of Zeus. The king of the gods dispatched an eagle to steal one of Aphrodite's sandles. To retrieve it, the goddess was forced to submit to Hermes. This union produced a double-sexed child: Hermaphroditus.<br>
<br>
Aphrodite also slept with the youngest of the gods, Dionysus. But Hera, who disapproved of Aphrodite's free ways, deformed their child Priapus. She made the boy incredibly ugly and endowed him with gargantuan genitles-an ironic comment on his mother's behavior. <p>Goddess Artemis
