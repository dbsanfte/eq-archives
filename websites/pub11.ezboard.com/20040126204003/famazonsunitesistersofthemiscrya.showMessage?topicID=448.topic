 &quot;Megan, honey..what happened?&quot; Solari asked as she began to look at her daughter's arm. <br>
<br>
 &quot;We were playing on the river bed when something came out of the water and bit me.&quot; she replied, wiping her face free of tears. <br>
<br>
&quot;Who is 'we' and what came out of the river to bite you?&quot; Solari asked as she reached into her bag and pulling out some cloth to bandage her daughter's arm with.<br>
<br>
&quot;A sea nymph.&quot; Megan answered, trying not to let another sob out. <br>
<br>
 Solari looked at Del with a arched brow. Why would a sea nymph come this far into the village, unless on a specific purpose from Posidion?<br>
&quot;Where did this sea nymph go, honey?&quot; Solari asked as she tied the bandage off. <br>
<br>
&quot;I dont know, she disappeared when that creature came out of the water. &quot; Megan answered. &quot;It was very scaley and had lots of teeth. It didnt make any noise until it was biting me.&quot; <br>
<br>
Solari helped Megan to her feet, made sure that her daughters were ok, and to reassure them that she wasnt upset with them, then set them directly home. She then turned to Del, giving her a perplexed look, the turned back to look at the river, scanning it for some glimsp into what came onto the river shore<br>

<br>
This happened a long time ago, she did not think Poseidon still was bitter about it, but who knew with an Olympian God.<br>
<br>
Biting her lip, she looked to Solari<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe we should just stay away from the river for some time, If the children wish to play and swim, maybe they should be escorted, just until we come to the bottom of this.&quot;<br>

 &quot;Yes, I think we should at least have a escourt for my kids, seeing as I cant be with them every minute of the day. Alkaria and Megan both are in their swimming training now, which is why they were here. But I didn't know that we had a unexpected visitor. Hippolyte needs to be wary of this as well..we dont need a panic on our hands as far as the other amazon children are concerned.&quot; <br>
<br>
She sighed deeply, sounding extremely old in that moment. <br>
 &quot;Megan's wounds didnt look too deep. Seems something with sharp teeth did bite her, like a wild dog... but what creature lives in a river like that?&quot;  <br>
 She moved and rested her head on her friends' shoulder, sighing softly once more. &quot;If Posiedon is after my children, he is going to have to go thru me first.&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=solariwolf@amazonsunite>solariwolf</A> at: 3/10/03 8:29:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vasilissadelerium>Vasilissa De Lerium</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Vasilissa Apo Themiscrya</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#993300>(3/11/03 4:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=448.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/deleriuml9/images/del2.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Sneaky Creature</span><hr size=1> As Solari placed her head on her shoulder, she put an arm around her shoulders in a hug.<br>

 &quot;I dont know what it was exactly. Megan has never seen a sea nymph, so I dont know what one would be doing this far inland. The bite marks, from what i could tell here, looked like a animal attack. I sent her home to where I could look at it better. &quot;<br>
<br>
 She looked to her company, nearly forgetting her manners. &quot;If you would like, please join my family for dinner and perhaps we can figure out what happened.&quot; She motioned them to follow her down the path towards her hut.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thanatosofdeath@amazonsunite>Thanatos of Death</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.joerghuber.com/images/art_c48.jpeg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#993300>(3/13/03 12:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=448.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Come on down!</span><hr size=1> *Thanatos considers the offer for a moment.* <br>

 &quot;Perhaps then, something to drink.. Megan may be able to tell us more once I give her a tonic to drink. &quot; She continued on down the path until she reached the steps to her expansive hut, one fit for a war queen. <br>
 &quot;Megan, come here so we can look at your arm again.&quot; She called once on the porch. &quot;Alkaria, please bring me my bag of herbs and some water.&quot; <br>

She had gotten her sister calmed down and watched as her mother began to unwrap the bandage. <br>
<br>
&quot;Honey, will you bring me the lantern?&quot; Solari asked of Alkaria. <br>
<br>
She went and grabbed the lantern inside the doorway, made sure it was lit, then took it back to her mother and her company. <br>
&quot;Here, mother.&quot; She said softly. &quot;What are you going to do now?&quot; She asked, watching closely.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, I am going to see just how bad these wounds are on your sister.&quot; her mother answered as she handed the tonic of mixed herbs to Megan to drink. After her daughter had finished the drink and making a funny face, Solari began to look more closely at the wounds. <br>
<br>
<br>
Alkaria felt bad for her little sister, knowing that she was responsible for her. Doing as big sisters do at times, she placed a comforting arm around Megan as she began to relax more from the herbal drink.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thanatosofdeath@amazonsunite>Thanatos of Death</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.joerghuber.com/images/art_c48.jpeg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#993300>(3/13/03 3:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=448.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://web.mit.edu/vicmoral/www/img/mo-dream.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Watching</span><hr size=1> *Thanatos followed Solari down the trail and into the spaceous hut.

 &quot;These look like animal bites. See how they are close together.&quot;<br>
 She turned to look at Thanatos. Wanting his input, she reached down for some more water to pour over the wounds.For the most part, the bleeding had stopped and not the redness of infection was beginning to set in. As Solari wiped down her daughter's arm carefully, she noticed something stuck in Megan's hair. She reached up and gently pulled it out, noticing how it glimmered in the torchlight. It was scaly looking and had a hint of yellow in it. <br>
 &quot;This looks like a snake scale.&quot; She said softly. &quot;But what snake lives in the water like that?&quot; <br>
<br>
 No sooner has she asked the question, did Solari realize the answer. She had only heard of them in stories during her travels, never having seen a real one. Hydra's lived in or near the water....could it be that one has visited the amazons? She looked at her daughters, then to her company for possible answers.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goddessartemis>Goddess Artemis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Virgin Huntress</span><br>  Posts: 444<br> <font color=#993300>(3/14/03 12:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=448.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> inspection</span><hr size=1> As they walked over to examine the would, her eyes narrowed.
