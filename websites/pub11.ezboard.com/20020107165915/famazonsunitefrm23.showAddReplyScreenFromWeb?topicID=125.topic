 The sky was black in the moonless night. Even shadows could not be made or seen. If not for the stillness and quiet of forest, Serena would have stayed asleep.<br>
Dark figures matching the night began to mill around her new home with Hercules. And the former hind's senses went on alert. Quickly, Serena rose out of her bed and fumbled for her clothing. Then she grabbed a dagger that she had always kept near the bed. By the Gods, she thought, we can't Hercules be here now. <br>
Her hand held onto the dagger tightly, her back to the wall and her eyes set upon the doorway. It was like she could feel them massing outside. <br>
Her heart raced as she stood and waited. <br>
Then suddenly there was a crash behind her in the wall. Armored hands grabbed her and pulled her thru the open gash in the home that she shared with Hercules. She screamed and kicked, slashing the dagger to anything it would hit. The figures pulled her out in the dark forests. Until her cries were heard no more.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uherculestlj.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hercules TLJ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hero</span><br>  Posts: 110<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(7/25/01 6:23:47 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Home</span><hr size=1> The morning sun was rising high as Hercules made his way down the familiar trail home.

He ran to the house, where now he was looking thru a large opening in the wall. <br>
&quot;SERENA!&quot;, he yelled and looked around frantic. Quikly he moved thru the gash looking for clues.  The bed was not made and blankets strewn about.  He walked around the house, and then once exhausting all corners back out into the yard angered.  <br>
&quot;SERENA!!!!!!&quot;<br>
Then a glint of something caught his eye and he looked down.  It was Serena's dagger and next to it, a peacock feather. &quot;Hera,&quot; he said not surprised.

The guards let go of Serena and stepped back.  She was now chained to the floor of the temple and glared back at the huntress. &quot;I have nothing to say to you, Sin.&quot;<br>
Sin laughed, for the hind knew the familiar of Hera well.  They were two immortal beings aligned with the Olympians closely.  They had even once been on the same side.  Yet, now that has changed.<br>

Hera walked over to Serena, &quot;Well, my child.  It seems things just don't always turn out how they were planned do they?&quot;<br>
The Queen's blue eyes glance over at Sin and then back to Serena.  A slender hand reached out and ran around Serena's neck and then up her chin as the ice blue eyes glared into Serena's warm ones. &quot;One should never forget their loyalties.  That wasn't smart leave my son, Ares for Hercules.  You were lucky for a time.  I decided your love for Hercules was good.  But, now....&quot; Hera let go of Serena's chin and spun around walking away.<br>
&quot;It seems your little hero had decided to cross me again,&quot; Hera titled her head to look at a large peacock statue in the great room. &quot;And that is a very unwise decision.&quot;<br>
The Queen of the Gods faced Serena.<br>
The hind glared back refusing to speak to Hera.<br>
A cold look with no expression fell upon Hera's face.  &quot;Well, now hind...your loyalties are going to return.  I think I shall return you to Ares, child.&quot;<br>
Hera lifted up a slender hand palm up...her ice blue eyes glaring into Serena's again. Then her wrist flicked in a graceful move and her palm faced down. &quot;Back in time you shall go.  Back to where your destiny lay.&quot;<br>
Serena screamed and fell to the floor crumpled up in a ball.  Her body seemed to glow every now and then until the glow was bright and shinning.  Serena's screams then changed into an odd cry.  One that was quickly recognizable as that of a hind.  Serena stood quickly and found herself on four hooves...and lost.   She was again, the golden hind.<br>

He then turned his gaze back to his son.  &quot;You should be grateful for the intervention on my part.  Otherwise, your precious hind would have met Hades much sooner then many of us wanted.  Sometimes, son, you have to love something enough to let it go.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uherculestlj.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hercules TLJ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hero</span><br>  Posts: 115<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(7/27/01 5:30:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Serena</span><hr size=1> As he listened to Zeus's words, he unfortantly knew the King of the Gods was right.  The whole time he had been with Serena, they both knew that she was endanger.  She possessed something they wanted and was with Hercules.  He knew that his peace he had had with Hera could not have lasted forever.  And his brother Ares, surely would have stepped in and complicated matters.  His eyes began to tear, but Hercules forced back any waters that would have shed.<br>
&quot;I knew it wouldn't take long before your Olympians would tear things up in my life again,&quot; He almost glared at his father. &quot;Now promise me, they will leave her alone.&quot;<br>
At least if he could get some sort of promise that the Gods would not harm Serena.  He could have that peace.  Even if his heart was shattered. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=madmartigan>Madmartigan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 116<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(7/27/01 10:54:59 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Watcher</span><hr size=1> ::Madmartigan watched what was going on intently to make sure he cought everying that was said.

She glanced briefly to her father, then spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;My dear young brother, you know that your request is not possible. Ares for one is always after the hind. We cannot gaurentee anything. There are only so many of us and with our granted powers there are ways to trick one another.&quot;<br>
<br>
She thought briefly of Poseidon.<br>
<br>
&quot;I myself shall do my part in seeing justice will be brought to any that harms her. The Furies have say so in over seeing the punishments of mortals and some Gods, but in this case, I have my say so upon Olympus if the Hind is harmed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Knowing that her words would not bring much comfort to her brother, she still hoped that he believed her in knowing she would help as much as she could. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFF33>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#FFFF33> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23>The Olympian Gods</a> <font color=#FFFF33> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#FFFF33> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
