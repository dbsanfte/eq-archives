She had sent the young god to Mount Olympus to meet up with his father.  He had a home and place their, which made her very proud.  Thankfully he was smart and quick, this keeping him safe from harm.  And with the friendship of many of his Olympian relatives, he would be alright.<br>
It was she, herself, that now had to keep an eye out.<br>
She knew that Hera had sent someone looking for her.  Alecto had made it clear that Maia was being hunted down.<br>
Her eyes had to be on the lookout for any danger as she strolled down the road that lead away from the Temple.<br>
<br>
Soon, she made her way to an Inn and pushed the door open.  She stepped inside and looked around.  There were a few people there.  And a quiet bar.
