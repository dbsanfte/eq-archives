Hippolyte pushed back the long peacock patterned curtains from her door and stepped out of her hut.  She had been growing concerned for her two athelfi that had gone to investigate Gargarensia.  Hippolyte stood at her doorway and gazed off into the distant forests.  Her brown eyes almost seeming to try and pierce the thick foliage to see her missing athelfi.  She could only trust that Dawn and Sartha's great skills would get them safely home again.  <br>
