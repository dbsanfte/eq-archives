Frost was worried that she could not provide suitably for the cubs and wished to find good homes for them.<br>
She arrived at the village early that morning.  It seems everyone was still sleeping or off on their duties.  Justine rode in On Aidan and headed towards the place where Frost directed her to go in her note.  <br>
As Justine drew closer she could hear some rustling in the bushes.  She knew she was being watched carefully.  She stopped Aidan and teetered him to a tree and set off on foot to look for Frost.  Deeper and deeper into the woods she went and then, she was tackled from behind, big furry paws on her shoulders.  Justine was not frightened as she turned onto her back and looked up into the crystal blue eyes of Frost.  &quot;Well my friend.  And a good morning to you too!&quot;  Justine chuckled as she rose dusting off her leathers.<br>
She followed Frost deeper into the forest and then she heard them.  As Frost shifted into her human form, a flurry of fur balls appeared from under the brush.  The huddled around Frost growling softly at the stranger with their Mother.  After awhile, the cubs starting moving towards Justine, curious as they sniffed her boots.  One little one caught Justine's eyes.  The one who looked just like Frost.  Justine bent and lifted the cub and saw that it was a male.  &quot;What's his name?&quot;   &quot;Sleek&quot; Frost replied.  Justine nuzzled the cub as he playfully swatted at her hair.  &quot;May I take him?  He would be a perfect companion for Dabriel.  She's love him, I know she will.&quot;<br>
Frost  gave her approval and after some more small talk, Justine took her leave.  With Sleek tucked safely in her saddlebag, she mounted Aidan and with a wave of her hand, started off towards Loreil.  She needed to get back to school, her spring break just about over.<br>
Before she went to the Warden's Keep, she stopped at the docks and went into the shipping office.  She made arrangements for Sleek to be shipped to Carnait Cove immediately.  The man gave Justine a parchment and quill and she penned a note to include with the crate addressed to Fhad about the cub and telling him how to care for Sleek.  <br>
She kissed the cub before placing him in the large crate.  She knew he would be fine for the short trip to Carnait Cove and his new home.  She could only imagine the expression on Fhad's face when he saw Sleek and the note Justine would receive at the Keep.  She could hear the yelling already as she chuckled softly and headed towards the Warden's Keep and her room there.:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessage?topicID=169.topic"> << Prev Topic </a> &nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessage?topicID=197.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=199.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.emailToFriend?topicID=199.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.threadControl?topicID=199.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=199.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=199.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm17">Amazons of Phylace<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm24">Evander's Army<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya>Sisters of Themiscrya</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://hometown.aol.com/queenhippolyte/SoT.html">Home</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.2 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
