like to apologize for not showing up at the raid on Saturday evening.  I was in Lower Guk the whole evening gaining experience.  As a result of being there all afternoon and evening, I gained enough xp to get halfway through one of the worst hell levels, 45.  I should have dropped it to come to the raid, but I didn't.  I am sorry for the lack of judgement on my part.<br>
<br>
One reason that I did not go, though, was that when people started logging on, I asked if they were going to Najena.  Nobody expressed any interest in heading there from where they were, so I just kind of dropped the subject assuming that nobody wanted to raid that evening.  Then Khoal got on and wanted to go somewhere where he could get experience, which is understandable, but that makes it tough for the lower level members.  I agree that the Mystic Entity raid was very well led. Snork is an excellent leader.  Another thing is that even if I was there, I could not have guaranteed no deaths because I, myself, do not know the zone of Sol A at all.  I feel that my knowledge of the zone is too limited for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> me</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to lead the raid.<br>
<br>
My suggestion would be that if you do not enjoy the place where we are raiding for the month (i.e. Najena), voice your concerns here.  It seemed as if nobody wanted to go back to Najena.  Would you guys rather go back to Unrest?  Was that a better raid location?  I was not able to attend any of the Unrest raids due to RL issues.  I cannot lead a guild without support from the members.  I do not get support from members unless you all tell me what you are thinking.  Since there is such limited use of these message boards, it is hard to know what everyone wants.<br>
<br>
/jokingmode on<br>
<br>
Khoal is bad luck in dungeons!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I followed him into Crystal Caverns one time and got killed twice.  Nobody was around for a rez and I lost a level.  The next week, Valmar went to CC with Khoal, and practically the same thing happened.   I went to help recover Val's corpse the next day.  Khoal is a good player, but sometimes bites off more than he can chew.  (no offense intended)<br>
<br>
/jokingmode off<br>
<br>
Generally, raids tend to go better if they are planned out.  I believe the Mystic raid had been planned well in advance.  They had decided where in the zone they were going, and what they were doing.  Things were conned and then assigned to the groups that got experience for them.  This is the type of planning that is needed to carry out succesful raids, I believe.  It is very difficult to make a raid successful when thrown together at the last minute.  If you guys want to raid Sol A, then I will volunteer to go and spend some time there and see what is around.  I would like to have some company if I am to do this.  Perhaps Valmar, Arichiena, Dadijob and Rensai or Elupis could help me out with that.  /em wishes we had a cleric.<br>
<br>
Val, Dadi and Arich, please post times that you could do this with me.  Us higher folk need to explore some places for possible raids.<br>
<br>
I will post about our weekly raids on Mystic Entity's message board and invite them to come along.  With more people, the chances of dying are less, assuming it's not just a clusterf&amp;%$.<br>
<br>
Again, I cannot be a good leader without the help of my members.  Please, please, please get people to USE THESE BOARDS!  I have tried, but to no avail.  We consistently only have around 5 people who will post.  When I do a /who all benevolent and see 12-15 people on at once, I wonder why we only get 3-4 posts per week on the board.  Just doesn't make sense.<br>

I don’t mean this as a flame and not necessarily the stance of the guild. Just my own personal point of view.<br>
<br>
  “at least 4 guild officers online who did not attend.”<br>
<br>
 Attending Officers<br>
 Khoal, Gokulot Elupis, Mathusis, Arichiena <br>
 Non-attending Officers online (that I was aware of)<br>
 Giradella, Germania <br>
Eorgal is not an officer unless recently appointed, Giradella explained herself and at lev 29 it would’ve been suicide for Germania to attempt to meet up with us going solo to an area he had never been before. Remember that this was not the intended location for raid. I don’t expect every officer to be at every guild raid though I feel that the responsibility should be shared among officers when raid is within their individual experience level. <br>
<br>
“None of the guild leaders excepting Khoal even tried to take charge” <br>
<br>
  I hope to never be in a group where leadership is based on officer status. <br>
Within a guild, officers are elected or appointed with different responsibilities in mind. I have some knowledge of tradeskills, Gokulot maintains the vault, and other officers were appointed to make it easier to enlist new members. I went on the raid in support of a guild function. I never intended to take charge of a raid in an area that I had no experience or knowledge of.        <br>
 <br>
“Two guild officers told me they EXPECTED the raid to turn into a mess”<br>
<br>
That is attitude we can’t afford to have from any member in the guild much less an officer.  I’m guessing the comment is in response to going to an area where they themselves had no familiarity. <br>
<br>
The rest, I am sorry to say, I am pretty much in agreement with Rensai.  <br>
<br>
My 2cp on the subject<br>
<br>
   I think the problem goes beyond just an organizational issue. There is also an experience issue. Our highest-ranking members are low to mid 40s. Many of our higher members have not had the opportunity to group with higher levels and are just as new to these dungeons as the people they are taking.  We need to get to a point where at the very least, the people leading the raid are familiar with the area. I completely agree that a group should be formed to scout out and familiarize themselves with an area that they are going to lead. <br>
<br>
  I think we should also establish guidelines when putting a guild raid together. The following is only my personal opinion as to what is needed. I freely admit I am not an authority on raids and welcome any comments/changes/suggestions anyone else has. But is important that some kind of guideline be set so that expectations are both understood and met.   <br>
<br>
1. First and foremost establish the objective of the raid. <br>
Are you going for experience, to camp and item or to familiarize a group with an area.<br>
Most raids are not for experience so if this is not the objective then make this clear. This way people won’t complain because they got little or none. There are usually for one of 2 reasons for raids:<br>
 A) So a group of appropriate level players can get familiar with an area with the support/safety of higher levels teaching them. Now that they have learned the tricks to what they need to survive that area they can return on their own. If this is the case then it is essential that we have leaders that are real familiar with the area and those leaders are established ahead of time.<br>
 B) Camping/Farming   Often raids are created to gather items for guild members or help obtain a needed quest item. In this case the item(s) should be determined ahead of time with a few backups in the event that that item is already camped. This is where the support of guild members is essential and the understanding that at some point you will asked to go on a raid to help someone obtain an item that you yourself may get no experience or benefit from.<br>
2. Establish level range required to go on the proposed raid. If you try and set up a raid to cover all levels it WILL either fall apart requiring too many leaders trying to support all the different level ranges or people will die being in groups they are to low to be in. <br>
3. Establish the location that the raid is to take place. Most dungeons will support multiple level ranges. If a location is set for a 1-month period you can divide different weekly raids into different level ranges that have been predetermined.<br>
4. Establish who will be the leaders for the raid and each group. These leaders should already be well familiarized with area as well as what tactics are required. If the appointed leader for a group can not show or must leave the group then the raid ends then and there for that group. <br>
5. Raids that are set up to take place in an area that is new to a group should begin at or near entrance and then expanded from there as group becomes more familiar with layout. Specifically, an escape route.    <br>
6. Once groups are established, individual roles should be assigned within the group. Everyone should know who is in charge, who the main tank is, the main healer, who is responsible for whom, what role they play and most importantly what the evac plan is and who decides when to evac. <br>
<br>
   Happy to be a part of any group to scout an area before raid. Would almost insist on it if I were expected to be involved in a leadership role.  I like the list Giradella put together though I hope to see Khoal included since he seems to have extensive experience and knowledge of many areas. <br>
<br>
   As far as inviting other guilds to raids I personally feel that we should get ourselves experienced in running them first. It’s bad enough when we lose our own members on a raid. I would hate it even more to be responsible for the deaths of members of another guild we invited. Don’t think it would do much for our reputation. <br>
 <br>
  As an Enchantress I can be of some help with lower level player raids. I can buff/debuff/Rune/Clarity without taking away from their exp. I can also keep a few groups of mobs Mezzed and put them on hold. <br>
  <br>
  Unless of course we are in a small 4 sided room with doors on each side for mobs to come through and a room that consists of nothing more than a ledge circling a large pillar taking up almost the entire room that you can neither see or cast around and containing multiple mobs all timed to spawn at the same time who summon other mobs to their aid.    <br>
   But hey, what are the odds of finding a place like that. <br>
