His midnight blue toga dragged on the floor as he came up to two guards at the face of Hades' throne room. The guards bowed to Apollo and let him pass.<br>

His azue eyes bounced around the throne room, to find no one. His eyes glazed over golden as he recieved a vision, of Hades and Persephone in the garden. He quickly began to scurry in the direction of the beautiful garden.<br>

Down twisted halls, dark corridors, and across a stone bridge that stretched across a underground lake and where millions of bats slept above... And at the end of the bridge was a silver door greatly decorated with opals, dimonds, and splashes of gold. And inside, was a great, vast room, most of the room was filled with books from wall to wall, mostly spells, and other things like that. There were also some tables, beakers, and things like that to make and mix the dreams. <br>
 <br>
But in the center was a giant pillar of stone with gems stuck all over it, and a stairway swirling in and out of it. Leading up to a archive of mushroom growing rooms, most which could be found no where else on earth. With these he used to make dreams, which he also mixed with from herbs and plants from the dark valley, with a touch of magic of course. <br>
        <br>
On the stairwell going down, led to a giant room with shelves that went hundreds of feet up and on the shelves were glass bottles that held swirling colors, and sparks and all sorts of wonderous things. These were the dreams that Hypnos made for the world that brang inspiration and things like that to it. There were probably billions times billions times billions of dreams. But Hypnos had just gather some small mushrooms that were only a tenth of an inch tall, and some lavender for a new dream he was about to make.  <br>
<br>
He put them into a bottle and shook it all up and then he cast a spell over it as he made it turn a bright blue with small bubbles that were dark blue within it. This one was for Apollo, he wasn't really sure why he needed, probably for prophecy or something... He then wrapped it black silk, and gave it to a cobalt and told him to deliver it to Apollo at once, then he started to work on something that might be able to find the person that broke the chains of hephesteus...*** <p>~*~*~*~*~Thè göd ö §|èèp~*~*~*~*~        </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uthegreatapollo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Great Apollo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 104<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(10/26/01 11:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=181.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Still waters run deep....</span><hr size=1> Apollo's brow perked as Hecate appeared infront of him, her sly smile painted a cross her face.

&quot;Bonsoir...such an...&quot; his eyes rose as he searched for the proper words.<br>
&quot;Unexpected, yet pleasant surprise!&quot; he smiled and took Hecate's hands within his own.<br>
&quot;How are you on this fine day? I, myself, am fine. Though I wish to talk to my uncle about something.&quot;<br>
<br>
As he was saying this a small sleepy looking being appeared before him bearing the emblem of Hypnos himself. He outstretched his hands to reveal the concoction that hypnos had dabbled together for one reason or another.<br>
<br>
&quot;For you, Lord Apollo...&quot; the cohort bowed to Apollo.<br>
<br>
Apollo took the small bottle from the beings hands and rose it up to his nose to more closely examine it. It was like a swirling torrent of purple smoke and blue mist, with lavender liquids bubbling about.<br>
<br>
&quot;Interesting...&quot; he thought to himself, he quickly smiled to the minion and waved his hand dismissing him. In a puff of purple smoke and sage rain, he vanished.<br>
<br>
&quot;Seems to be a potion of some sort, from Hypnos.&quot; he looked to Hecate then to the bottle, his azure eyes seemingly aflame with wonder and thought.<br>
&quot;Yes yes...&quot; he said, comming to his senses, he was here for a reason.<br>
&quot;I must find Poseidon. So if you'll please excuse me, I must be off to the balcony, if there is nothing I can do for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Apollo eyed the potion and stuck it into a inner flap within his tunic.

He knelt down next to a flower and smelt it.  He never really understood what Persephone saw in these things, but he respected it none the less.  He plucked the flower off the ground and walked up the staircase to the balcony.  He handed Persephone the flower and kissed her on the cheek, kneeling beside her.  Sensing the presence of Apollo he whispered in his wife's ear::  &quot;If you'll excuse me...I'll be right back.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He then stood up and walked down the stairs to meet Apollo.  He foldes his arms and stood before him.  His eyes were somber and domineering.  In his mind yet another 'intruder' in his Land.::<br>

He raised his left hand and with one swift movement removed the hair from his eyes. He blinked a few times, thinking of what to say.<br>
<br>
&quot;Did anything...abnormal happen down here, like today? Because something was rocking the world, litterally. I was in the Realm of Light, and still my palace began shaking! Something terrible must have happend. &quot; his face looked eager and upset, he wanted to know what was going on.<br>
<br>
&quot;And I am gravely sorry if I interupted anything with Persephone, but situations such as these  have no time for hesitation.&quot;<br>
