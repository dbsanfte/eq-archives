<br>
Kala quickly snapped out of her thoughts when she noticed a large centaur coming at her.She growled and and ran at the centaur as fast as she could,before there was a head on colision she lept up into the air,doing a quicky front flip,then landed on the centaurs back.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hows it going?&quot;She mused as she unsheathed one of her boot daggers and held it to the centaurs throat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn you woman!&quot;The centaur growled as he knew his time was up.<br>
<br>
Kala then slid the blade of the dagger across the throat of the centaur.The centaur grapsed his throat with a loud groan and tumbled over.<br>
Kala lept of the centaurs back just as he was falling,she landed square on her feet,and watched the centaur die.She then turned and ran into the battle.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=queenalysia>Queen Alysia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen</span><br>  Posts: 130<br> <font color=#993300>(11/30/00 9:46:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Captured!!!</span><hr size=1> Alysia drew her sword. The one without the cronus stone in the hilt, and began to slay the Centaurs like they her lambs to the slaughter. She had blood dripping off of her hands. Three Centaurs charged at her, but she was ready for them. She had been training her whole life for this battle, she had to. She flipped around and her sword slid across their bellies like nothing. They tripped over oneanother and died in their own pool of blood. She grinned. But then she saw Cora struck down. &quot;Cora!!!!&quot; She had lost Alexa, she would not loose Cora. She began running towards her fallen daughter and grandson, when her back was turned she was struck down by a Centaur holding a staff. The staff hit the back of her head and she came down on her own dagger cutting the shin of her leg. Screaming in pain she growled but before she had a chance to regain herself and stand, she was hit once more and two Centaurs took her by the arms and rode off towards the forest. <br>
<br>
<br>
Hours later the Centaurs were found dead. They had taken her far beyond the break of the mountains and she was still wounded. She has treated her wound for she knew that if she had come back to the village wounded, she would be an easy target.<br>
<br>
She didn't even kill the horse men, her pack of wolves her waiting for them. Apparently as the Cenatur army hid in the lost caves of Scynthia, they were devoured by the pack. Aly sent her wolves back to Scynthia to help.<br>
<br>
She eventually found her way back to the village and as she entered she couldn't see Cora or many of the amazons of her tribe. Others from Sarmatia, Themiscrya and Acrania had come to help and she was grateful for them. She also saw Ariah. &quot;Ariah!&quot; She called out right before a Centaur was about to attack Ari from behind. Aly flipped forward and sheathed the sword containing the chronus stone and plunged it into the Centaurs chest. His blood poured out and his body combusted in a burst of wild flames. She then knew the power of the stone.<br>
