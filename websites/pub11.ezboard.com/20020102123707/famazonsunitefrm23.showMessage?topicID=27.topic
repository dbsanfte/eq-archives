Her brown eyes gazed up at the great temple wide eyed.  Even though she had her own small temple built within her village, Hippolyte had thought she would venture out and see a larger one built for her grandmother.  She slide off the back of her mare, and brushed back wild auburn locks from her face as she looked at the guards.  Dressed in her amazon leather armour and a short burgandy cape, she walked up the steps and was quickly stopped.<br>
&quot;What do you want Amazon!&quot; One of the guards commanded.<br>
Hippolyte raised a brow and smirked, &quot;To see the temple of my grandmother.&quot; Her brown eyes peered at him with a don't mess with me attitude, not too unlike Hera's.  <br>

It was grand and beautiful, decorated in purples, blacks, gold, and greens.  Of course, there were several statues of peacocks everywhere and she smiled as she saw a white male peacock with some hens wandering part of the temple.  There were several priestesses wandering around busy and giving Hippolyte a wary eye.  The amazon then walked right up to the main altar of the temple.  There stood a larger peacock and a reflecting mirror.  She had one of those herself, giving to her by Hera.
