The weather was pleasant, and everyone seemed to be fine. Birds were singing and the wind was blowing softly.<br>
That was about to change.<br>
The wind slowly started to pick up, and before long it seemed like there was a hurricane overhead. Suddenly, a small tornado seemed to blow into the village, and a young woman with flaming red hair appeared just as it started to die down. She looked around, wondering if she was in the right place.<br>
&quot;Anyone here?&quot;<br>

<br>
Rhiannon recieved word from a one of the amazons on guard duty that a mysterious woman had appeared outside the gates. Assured that her Sister Queen had also gotten the message and would join her as soon as she was able, Rhia put down the scrolls she had been reading about the possiblitities of new farm land to the west, and headed towards the gates. <br>
<br>
She was rather thankful for the distraction actually, the reports had been quite boring. Especially on such a sunny day. She had heard the wind pick up momentarily though, unusual, as there was hardly a cloud in the sky. <br>
<br>
Upon reaching the gates, she noticed the woman she had been told about. Unfortunately, the visage was all too familiar to her. For a moment she contemplated turning around and leaving her out there, but knew that that would only result in a few guards ending up dead. <br>
<br>
However much she did not like Kalasin since her return from the dead, and however much she might confront her in Hyrcania, here Rhiannon was a Queen, and had to act as such. Which meant letting her in. <br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome Kalasin.&quot; She gestured to the guards to open the gates. &quot;What brings you to Marpesia?&quot; <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://user.netomia.com/angelkim/rhia.png"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;">~*~Rhiannon~*~<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/bamazonnation">Shatomlic Healer</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm55">Co-Vasilissa of SoH</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->~*~Everything is okay in the end.

She actually looked happier than she did when Rhiannon had seen her previously.<br>
<br>
K - I like it up here you know. So much nicer than Hyrcania.<br>
<br>
The young Enforcer chuckled, and for a moment, you could almost see some of the old Kalasin inside of her. It got to the point where Rhiannon could have sworn that the red from her hair was giving way to it's natural deep brown. The Shatomlic Amazon cocked her head to the left, as if the question had only just registered.<br>
<br>
K - Memories actually. I only vaguely remember the last time I was here… I liked it so very much that I thought I would come again. That is if you will have me.<br>
<br>
Before Rhiannon could ever react, the amazon continued to talk, she was not about to let anyone say something when she thought that she should.<br>
<br>
K - I know that I have not been the most sociable of people since I came back. In fact, I would say that I have been a downright bitch. *sighs* But, everything has it's reason. And so does my behavior. However, I realize that I have rather unfairly been treating you in a horrid manner. *pauses* And really, I came here to give my sincerest apologies. You must understand that my life is not mine to use as I please, and sometimes, that can lead to me to do and say things that should not be done. Imagine how you would feel if your every move was controlled by a goddess that you barely knew. *chuckles* Listen to me. I soud like I am trying to gain sympathy. I'm not really. And now that I have done my part, I think I may well have embarrassed myself enough, and should probably be on my merry way. You keep this village well though, compared to the evil surrounding Hyrcania, this place is a holiday home.<br>
<br>
Kalasin smiled weakly again, not used to talking so much. She stood there for a moment, wondering what the queen would say. It was not often that she apologized to anyone. She had only once apologized to Sumeria, and never to anyone else. <br>
<br>
K - I'm sorry to bother you, and I think that you would like for me to go now. Thanks for hearing me out and not trying to run me through like you probably should.<br>
<br>
The Enforcer started to slowly fade.<br>

She was not the type to hold a grudge, unless the grudge continued to add upon itself. Just before Kalasin winked out of existence, the young Queen spoke. <br>
<br>
&quot;Kalasin.&quot; She spoke the name as a command, out of habit now. <br>
<br>
Kalasin stopped fading, and even reappeared slightly, though her stubborn nature would not allow her to appear any more than was necessary to hear what was being said to her. <br>
<br>
&quot;I will not accept your apology.&quot; The shimmering image before her started to fade. &quot;Yet. You say you are an Enforcer of Good, and yet all I've seen you do so far is attack innocents. People defending their tribe, unarmed unconcious women barely old enough to be away from their mother's apron strings. I will accept your apology when you show that you can use judgement along with your new powers.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rhiannon stood and waited to see what Kalasin would make of her words. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://user.netomia.com/angelkim/rhia.png"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;">~*~Rhiannon~*~<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/bamazonnation">Shatomlic Healer</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm55">Co-Vasilissa of SoH</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->~*~Everything is okay in the end.

Kalasin generally did not take things as they were, and this was no exception. She looked like someone had just slapped her solidly across the face, a look that never showed on her pretty face.<br>
<br>
K – If you cannot accept that I have orders, then I do not know if you can ever be my friend. I do as I am commanded, not as I please. I am a servant Rhiannon, not a free woman. Every life has it’s price, and this is mine. I do not question Juno’s designs for me, all I know is that the people I kill are killed because they will serve what is coming.<br>
<br>
As she spoke, Rhiannons noticed that Kalasin’s dress was starting to wrap even tighter around her. The only times that it did that was when she was about to be called, or when she could sense an attacker coming near to her.<br>
<br>
K – Do you intend on trying to kill me Rhiannon?<br>

&quot;Kalasin, do you really remember so little as to think I would even presume to imagine that I could kill you. I fully realize that your skills at that are more...well honed than mine. &quot;<br>
<br>
She paused, letting the meaning of her words sink in. <br>
<br>
&quot;Answer me this. Were you under orders to cause great pain to Queen Eumache  and her guards? Women who were only looking after my welfare? Can you honestly tell me that that wasn't your choice? That you were ordered to do that to them?<br>
Or how about Isis? What threat was she, lying unconcious at your feet?&quot; <br>
<br>
She paused once more for breath. <br>
<br>

Did she truly believe that Kalasin was the same person? That the gods had allowed her to remain the same?<br>
<br>
K – I was ordered to hurt any people that posed a threat to me, and at the time, that was Eumache. Had I not, they would have told me to kill them. Isis on the other hand, I do not know about you, but I sensed something inside of her. There is something dark there Rhiannon, something that could well pose us a threat, that is why I did not take a liking to her. Once again, had they had their way, she would be dead.<br>
<br>
Kalasin sighed, she could not believe that the price for her life had not completely occurred to Rhiannon, she was a smart woman, proven by how quickly she had dissected various situations. The amazon frowned for a moment, trying to think of how best to say what she had to say.<br>
<br>
K – The price for me to return to the poepl I cared about was that I had to submit to whatever orders Juno gave me, until such times as she did not require me anymore. And that is exactly what has happened. I do not back down from a deal that I have made. You know this as well as me.*pauses* Perhaps I should ahve stayed dead rather than come back to be with my friends. It would have made things a lot easier on everyone else don't you think?<br>

She just could not abide all of this...this...hogwash.<br>
<br>
R: You will never convince me that Eumache and her guards were a threat to you. Or the guards at the gates. From their reports all they did was ask your name and you knocked them unconcious. What threat were they? They were merely doing their job. They hadn't even drawn weapons, as I found out when I went to check them. The Queen and her guards may have drawn, but what else were they to do? The gates guards are knocked unconcious, and then they happen to find an unfamiliar woman standing my own unconcious form. What I told you then still holds true. They would not have hurt you with a word from me. <br>
<br>
Towards the end, Rhiannon's voice gained a vehemence that shocked even Kalasin, though, true to form, the immortal showed no sign of it. This was a Rhiannon unlike she had seen pervious to her demise. <br>
<br>
Rhiannon waved to the gate keepers, who were trying to pretend to be busy, but were actually eavesdropping. <br>
<br>
R: Our guest is going to leave now. Inform me when she does so. Make no move towards her however. You cannnot make her go anymore than I can. <br>
<br>
Without even another glance at Kalasin, Rhiannon turned and walked back to her hut, where hopefully Lysippe was waiting. She could use the opportunity to discuss this interaction with someone much more levelheaded then Rhia's temper would ever let her be. <br>
<br>
Or maybe she would just cry. Kalasin had been a good friend. Being comforted right now seemed better and better with each step.<br>

She started to murmur in a tongue that was unfamiliar to the guards. However, after what appeared to be an argument, she smiled at them.<br>
<br>
K - Well, what can I say, I tried. But heck, if she wants an enemy, she has just found herself one. *blinks innocently* Do me a favour, one sister to another. Ask her whatever happened to the amazon sense of a second chance? When she can truly tell herself that she is doing the right thing, I might believe that she meant all of what she said. Oh, and finally, tell her that if she ever wishes to speak to me, she only had to call my name. I can hear it anywhere.<br>
<br>
With that said and done, the former Shatomlic Princess nodded, and mock-saluted the guards before vanishing.<br>

Rhiannon spoke more to herself than to the guard.<br>
<br>
&quot;A second chance? Perhaps if she were remorseful for what she had done and were making an effort to not do it again. But all she hands me is excuses for why she did what she did.&quot; Rhia absently dismissed the guard and continued on her way, mumbling as she went. &quot;No free will my behind! What was she doing here, so far from Hyrcania, if she had no free will? Did Juno tell her to come here and try to apologize.  That woman has the nerve to think I&quot;m being unreasonable?&quot; <br>
<br>
She screamed in rage just as she reached the door to her hut. It wasn't a loud scream to shake the earth, just the normal scream of frustration you would expect from someone like her. <br>
<br>
She opened the door, hoping against hope that Lysippe was inside.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://user.netomia.com/angelkim/rhia.png"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;">~*~Rhiannon~*~<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/bamazonnation">Shatomlic Healer</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm55">Co-Vasilissa of SoH</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->~*~Everything is okay in the end.
