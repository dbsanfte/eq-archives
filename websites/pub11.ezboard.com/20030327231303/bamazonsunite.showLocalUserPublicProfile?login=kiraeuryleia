  With Apollo as her father, he gave little Xerena  to one of his priestess,Auria, and had her brought to her Amazon village. 
  The queen of village, Kayala, raised the girl as her own daughter calling her, Kira, sensing that this child would be in danger if found. 
  At 14, her village was attacked and she watched over half of her sisters die.
  Because, as Xerena later found out, her mother's husband had brought an army to her home, looking for his wife's daughter to kill. Xerena's birth mother had died by that man after hiding her child.
  With a cold rage, Kira went in search of him, but has never found him to this day.
  Wanting to start fresh, Kira leaves her past behind and joins another tribe, hoping no one will know who Xerena may be...........</span></div>	</div> 	<div id="contactinfo">		<h2>My Contact Information</h2>		<div id="email"><span class="title">Email Address ::</span>  <span class="privatevalue">private</span></div>		<div id="pm">		<span class="title">My Inbox ::</span> 						<span class="value"><a href="" title="Send a message using the ezboard inbox feature" >Send me a Message!</a></span>				</div>		<div id="im"><span class="title">IM ::</span> <span class="value">AOL - </span></div>		<div id="link"><span class="title">Personal Link ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="" target="_blank">My Personal Link</a></span></div>		<div id="recentposts"><span class="title">Recent Posts ::</span> 								<span class="privatevalue">none</span>						</span>				</div>	</div>	<div class="spacer"></div> </div>  <!-- profile footer --> <div id="footing">© Copyright 1999-2002 <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/">ezboard, Inc.</a> All rights reserved.</div></div></body></html><!-- CSS:XHTML 2002 JR.o -->
