<br>
Since having had to step down from her Assasin gig,Zelia decided to begin with stable cleaning.<br>
<br>
She began by getting the 4 legged beasts out of the stable that needed cleaning,which wasnt easy,since most animals really dont like her,but she managed,and also managed to find a shovel.<br>
<br>
She figured it was a smart thing to wear her amazon leathers for the job,concidering her amazon leathers werent much of anything,litterally just strips of leather which should be easy to keep clean in what would be a messy job.Course,she also wore a pair of calf high boots,old ones. And hair tied back.<br>
<br>
When she smelled the stables,a piece of cloth was immidiatly wrapped around her mouth and nose to help keep the stench to a minimum.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ew....&quot; Squish squash as she stepped into the poopy covered stables. &quot;Oh,ew...&quot; She sticks the shovel down into the poo and old hay bedding,and lifts it off the ground,looking for a place to shovel the stuff. Without having much of a clue how to clean stable,she scurries to the other side of the stable and drops the shovel load there on the ground,then scurries back over to the poo piles.<br>
<br>
Again,she gets a shovel full,and scurries to the other side of the stables,but the stuff being a tad slippery. She slips,and falls on her butt. *Splat!*<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh dear god!&quot; She quickly tries to stagger to her feet,hoping not a soul saw her fall in the poo,she only manages to get herself a bit more messy before finally getting a grip on her footing. Trying to dust herself off didnt help a bit,and only made her get grumpy. With a huff and a low growl she kicks the shovel across the stables and leans against a wooden post,arms crossed over her chest.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is rediculous.&quot; She spat,and leant there,'pouting'.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;Ridiculous is the fact that you got off so easy.&quot;<br>
<br>
She growled lightly. Alysia was an Amazon Queen of her own tribe, as well as the Chieftess of Themiscrya. If Zelia did not show her proper respect at that time, she would surely begin to realise she needed to.<br>
<br>
&quot;A sister suffered in death for your actions, be grateful DeLerium showed you mercy. I know I wouldn't have.&quot;<br>
<br>
It was Alysia's task to assist Zelia in calming her destroyer instincts, Alysia would do as she had offered. . .  if it killed Zelia. . .  or not.<br>

&quot;Ah!&quot; She blinked and pressed a hand against her sore head,then shoots a glare over to the person responsible for throwing the shovel.<br>
<br>
When realising who it was the glare vanished from her features. &quot;Oh,it's you...&quot; She managed a slightly respectful bow of her head to Alysia/Samsara.<br>
<br>
&quot;DeLerium took my head that same day for my crime...&quot;<br>
She drew a finger across her throat where the scar was still visable. <br>
&quot;..Thats not exactly merciful,is it?&quot;<br>
<br>
She leant over and picked up the shovel from the ground before once again looking at Alysia/Samsara. A smile then crept the corners of her lips.<br>
<br>
&quot;In DeLeriums position,I probobly would have reacted the same...&quot; Silence then as she thought for a moment. <br>
&quot;However,upon thinking about it,DeLerium did show mercy and control at my return. For which I never would have....And i'm sure you'll let me know if it's not my place to compare myself with the Queen,Delerium.&quot; <br>
<br>
Looking over to Varia,her smile brightened.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey Varia,glad to see you.I could use some knowledge about this....this stable cleaning stuff.

&quot;Of course. And thanks for letting me know my place around here.&quot; She gave the friendliest smile she could manage,then looked back to Varia,but only for a moment. <br>
<br>
Tuning herself into the mission at hand,she looked around,and spotted a wagon which she concluded would be the wagon she'll use to transport the old hay and poo out and away from the stable.<br>
<br>
She then looked back to Varia.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,I guess I will start shoveling this mess into that wagon..&quot; Points to the wagon. <br>
&quot;Then I guess i'll lug it to....wherever,and then I figure i'll throw some fresh hay bedding around here...&quot;<br>

Scratches the top of her head.   &quot;That appears to be what needs to be done,am I wrong?&quot;  Hopes she's not wrong,because before she can get an answer,she begins to shovel poo into the wagon,quite quickly acctually. <br>

Just.... make sure you don't let the horses out while you do it. You go inside, push the horse over, and put the wagon in front of the door.&quot; Var took an old wheelbarrow, much smaller than the wagon, but sufficient for now, and demonstrated how Zelia should do it. She opened a stall and slipped inside, pulling the wheelbarrow after her so it blocked the door. Then she started shoveling, and soon the stall was bare. She patted the obedient mare and leaned over, setting the shovel against the wall outside the stall, and then jumped over the wheelbarrow, steadied herself, and moved it, closing the door.<br>
<br>
&quot;Voila!&quot; she exclaimed in Zelia's direction, waving an arm at her work. &quot;Now follow me, I'll show you where it goes.&quot; She pulled the barrow along behind her as she made her way over to the stables and down the hill to the manure pile, holding her breath at the stench. &quot;It only gets refertilized every other moon,&quot; she said with nasally speech, her nose being plugged with two fingers. She showed Zel how to dump the barrow, struggling a bit to get the last strands of hay out, kicking the back a few times before the thing was empty. Puffing out her cheeks, she headed back up the hill, dragging a much lighter wheelbarrow behind her. <p><html> <center> <font face="vivaldi" size="+2" color="#ff0000"> ~Varia Angelina Avande~ </font> </html></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamazonvelaska.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amazon Velaska</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_purplespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 221<br> <font color=#993300>(7/31/02 6:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=375.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Walking around Themsicya</span><hr size=1> * Velaska had been a few places after the death of Hope, travelling here and there to visit with tribes and there Queen's, just to catch up.

<br>
&quot;This doesn't seem very hard at all.&quot;<br>
<br>
As they reached the stables once more,Zelia looked at Velaska who was apparently ignoring her. Shrugging to herself,she tapped Var on the shoulder. &quot;Thanks for the help,I can handle it from here.&quot;<br>
<br>
She walked away from Var,so Var can go socialize with her friends.<br>
<br>
After a little while,Zel managed to get the wagon full of old hay and poo. Cleaning out all the stables that needed it and putting clean hay back in the stable.<br>
<br>
Walking infront of the wagon,she grabs hold of the two wooden handles and starts to pull the heavy load down the hill to the manure pile. Though the wagon was heavy,Zel made the process look somewhat easy.<br>
<br>
Down at the manure pile,she tips the wagon over,letting the load empty out onto the ground,into a large pile. What didnt come out easily  was shoveled out until the wagon was completely empty.<br>
<br>
Patting her hands together,she then lugs the empty wagon back up the hill and back to the stables.<br>
