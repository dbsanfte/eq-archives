<br>
 Dawn stood infront of a fire that was being built. The early morning sun shown down as she prepared the center of the village for the intiation of a new amazon. Near a stage like setting, was a tiny table and on that table a shamaness was preparing a dagger, sacred for the cermony. To the otherside of her, many amazons were working around to clear things out of the way, and set up the ground so that it was clean. <br>
<br>
 Tonight was a full moon, and tonight would be the night that Angel was made a real Amazon. <br>
<br>
 Taking a deep breath, Dawn continued to watch. This would be her first time intiating anyone into her tribe.. making her Angel a full amazon.<br>
<br>
 &lt;Angel&gt;<br>
<br>
 Angel had road into the village the night before, and now walked up to Dawn, standing at her side. Angel had idley thrust her hands into her jean pockets, and stood nervously watching. This was a big step for her, but it was something she wanted to do.. something that would make her complete. <br>
<br>
 Glancing around, Angel finally realized how out of place she looked. A smooth grin slipped across her lips.. perhaps she'd be getting another make over!<br>
<br>
 &lt;Dawn&gt;<br>
<br>
 As if reading the teens mind, looked over at Angel and nodded.<br>
<br>
 &quot;There will be wardrobe changes.. as soon as some more athelfi get here. . we'll start.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn turned on her heel and began walking toward her hut.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Go to your hut, get rested. An amazon will fetch you later&quot; <p>

<br>
She had been a nervous wreck at her coronation, so she'd assumed Angel would feel the same way and had descided to come early and see Angel before her intiation.<br>
<br>
After taking her blonde stallion, which was a birthday present from the Queen of Orio-Pata herself, she made her way to Angel's hut, which she knew somehow, and knocked lightly on the door. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 336<br> <font color=#939393>(9/9/01 8:23:39 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Angel's intiation into Orio-Pata</span><hr size=1>  &lt;Angel&gt;<br>

 Angel glanced at Belle as she opened the door, and wrapped her into a hug. She was as nervous as ever. The dagger had set her off.. she didnt' know what was going on.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I'm sooo scared!&quot;<br>
<br>
 Angel stepped back to let her into the hut, it was bare.. but it was new as well. Angel was sooo worried. <p>

&quot;Trust me, I know how you feel. I was scared stiff at my coronation, but there's nothing to be nervous about. You'll be amazing, I know you will.&quot;<br>
<br>
She gave a brief nod confidently before continueing,<br>
<br>
&quot;And before you know it, the iniation's over, and you're celebrating with the other Amazons, and you have a new family that will stand by you forever, and you're a part of a strong, wonderful, honorable, nation, and you're a perfect addition to it.&quot;<br>

<br>
Alysia appeared behind Belle smiling lightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes Belle, but remember you had a coronation. That is much different than an initiation. An Amazon is initiated when they are sixteen years or older. You've still got another year.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled to her daughter then to Angel.<br>
<br>
&quot;Congrats Angel, an Initiation is a sacred ceremony, you only have one per tribe.&quot;<br>
<br>
She too remembered hers into the Amazon Nation as a whole. It was overwhelming and very special.<br>
<br>
<br>
   <br>
<br>
Cyane had appeared a while earlier than the others. She was there to give any services to Queen Dawn that was needed.<br>
She appeared before the Queen in her usual ceremonial Amazon leathers and bowed her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am at your service Vasilissa.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
    <br>
<br>
Wulf had been in his hut alone all morning in deep meditation praying for the spirit of the Ancients to be with Angel at this time for it was sacred and special.<br>
<br>
Later on he had bathed in the river and prepared himself in his own leathers and helped some of the others assist with the fire. He would not be a large part of the actual traditions seeing that he was male, but he was an Amazon Prince and was here for Angel. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 338<br> <font color=#939393>(9/10/01 3:21:07 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Angel's intiation into Orio-Pata</span><hr size=1>  &lt;Dawn&gt;<br>

 Dawn glanced to Cyane and smiled lightly, motioning to those already at work and her son as well.<br>
<br>
 &quot;As you can see.. we've got alot of what we need, being done.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn glanced around once more, before turning back to face Cyane.<br>
<br>
 &quot;But as a shamaness.. I believe we could use you. Have you ever done an intiation, Cyane?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
 &lt;Angel&gt;<br>
<br>
 Those blue pools glanced to Aly, and she nodded, then glanced back to Belle.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I was told to get ready.. for the intiation.. and that a few amazons would be here to help me.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Angel stopped briefly.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Are you two it?&quot;<br>

&quot;Umm... Well... I don't think that's actually what we're supposed to be, but we could.&quot;<br>

<br>
After most of the things were set up for Angel's initiation, Wulf walked around Orio-Pata just observing. Few of the Amazons chose not to attend seeing that they weren't old enough. He passed by the training yards and smiled seeing the progression that had occured since he had left.<br>
<br>
<br>
      <br>
<br>
She sighed softly and frowned a bit.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sadly Vasilissa no, I haven't.  I am however willing to assist in anyway possible.&quot;<br>
<br>
Though Belle and Angel were closer, Cyane still felt like Angel was a good friend of hers, and she wanted to be apart of this.<br>
<br>
<br>
   <br>
<br>
Alysia smiled to both Belle and Angel as she slowly entered the hut.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I suppose that we could assist in here.&quot; She smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;If more amazons come to help, then we will leave and let them do what Dawn has asked.&quot;<br>

<br>
 Dawn nodded to Cyane, and grinned lightly.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Then you can help an old Queen, with something she has never done herself. I need to plan this.. and I could use some creative ideas.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn motioned to a table with tribal scrolls from other places on the intiation laws, and what is required as well as a blank one, for ideas to be wrote on.<br>
<br>
 Glancing off to another side, Dawn grabbed a leather messenger bag, and tossed it to a young amazon. Then directed her to take the contents to Angel. . so that she may have someone ready her for the ceremony. . . someone she would feel comfortable with.<br>
<br>
 &lt;The Amazon&gt;<br>
<br>
 The young girl nodded, taking the bag and heading off to Angel's new hut. Once there she cleared her throat, to get the attention of Belle and Aly. Once she did.. she held out the bag.<br>
<br>
 Inside, was a short leather skirt, that was slit up the side for smooth fighting, and then a corsit type top that laced tightly up the back. Then there was one sheath.. with a dagger.. it could be placed where ever on the body. As well as various jewelry.<br>
<br>
 &lt;Angel&gt;<br>
<br>
 Angel took the bag glancing to Alysia and Belle after the young girl told of Dawn's orders. Tossing it on the bed . . she glanced to them with a pleading look.<br>
<br>
 &quot;It looks like its up to you two.. and Belle knows how hopeless I am with fashion.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Angel grinned sheepishly.. glancing between the Queen and Princess.<br>
<br>
 &lt;A Demonic Tiger&gt;<br>
<br>
 Wulf was always welcome in the village of Orio-Pata.. he was afterall their prince. And when the mother of most of the demonic tiger cubs, seen the Queen's child come around.. it lumbered out of a shady area.. and padded to his feet. Purring loudly as she glanced upward at him. Obviously she was happy to see him.  <p>
