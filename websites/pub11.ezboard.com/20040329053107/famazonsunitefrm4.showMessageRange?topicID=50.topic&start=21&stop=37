She noted that the young woman appeared to be pregnant. She didn't look very far along yet, but the fact that she was pregnant was the important thing. <br>
&quot;Well, I do't know what I am going to do for the moment. Things have been piling up.&quot; she chuckled. &quot;I will stay here for at least a month.

She was however grateful that Kasalin was going to stay for a little bit, because once she took a look at Celaneo's belly she knew she was going to need help. Again she looks to be distant. Even though she was grateful to be home again, she didn't feel safe. After being attacked in a place that had always been safe to her, she was not as easy as before. She'd slept very little on the way back and it showed, her hands shook just a touch and her eyes looked glazed, but she also didn't have the time to worry about it. There were too many other things and other people to worry about and deal with, jumping at shadows would just have to wait. Pretending to be just fine however she looks over at Cel again, &quot;Feeling a little better? I don't want you to do building.

He stretched out a little further, turning to face the wall, nothing but his shirt under him.  His back was red from exposure to the sun but for now he was sleeping quietly as the girls talked behind him.  He would need to build himself a cot to sleep on at some point so that he didn't have to sleep on the ground.  He curled his knees upward to keep warm.  There was so much to do and he'd stay as long as Celaneo needed him to stay.  The army in Troy did not need him to return at this time.  Thankfully, in a time of peace he was free to do what he wanted provided that he send messages back checking in periodically.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=battlingangel>Battling Angel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 125<br> <font color=#993300>(6/9/03 6:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=50.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.speedis.org/images/214.png WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Getting Settled In</span><hr size=1> Kalasin looked at Theseus' sleeping form and she smiled. A lot had happened since she had last seen him, she had changed a great deal. And she could see, just by looking him over, that he had too. The Trojan Army must have done good things for him, that, or it had done bad things. Whatever it was, he looked like more of a man now than he did before.<br>
&quot;I simply cannot believe that he is Hippolyte's son.&quot; She said, more to herself than anyone else, but it was a subject open for discussion. &quot;He never once let that slip in Troy you know.&quot;<br>
The amazon chuckled to herself and ran a hand through her long blonde hair, sweeping it from her face as was common practice with her.<br>

She had not kept much track of time since she had arrived. “I wouldn’t know. It could be anything between two weeks and two months.” She replied quite quickly. “Things have been slow, very slow.”<br>
She sighed as she felt the pain rising up inside her again, she would need to rest soon. If she did not, she would collapse on the spot, not a good way to be presented to anyone. In her head, she cursed the man that had done this to her, even though she knew that no amount of curses would do. There were not enough.<br>
Slowly, she stood.<br>
“I am sorry, but I must have a brief rest, perhaps half of an hour?”<br>
As she took a few steps backwards, it was plain to see that she was limping, something that she had not been doing before. Kalasin cursed out loud in Vezrit for showing any sign of weakness. She was comfortable to use Vezrit, the language of her deceased mother extinct nomadic people. She knew that aside from her sister Dreyanne, no other person knew of it, and so she knew that if she wished to curse herself for any reason, this would be the best language in which to do so. She switched back to her fragmented Greek to address the people before her.<br>
“I will come back after that and finish this conversation, but for now I must rest, if not, I do fear the consequences.”<br>
