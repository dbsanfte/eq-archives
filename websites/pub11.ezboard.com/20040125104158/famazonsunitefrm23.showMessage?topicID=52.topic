The child was delicate and gazed up at her mother with pale icy blue eyes that resembled her mother's.  The Queen of the Gods had been away...and away for something very important to her.  She had given birth to a new daughter,  Eileithyia.  The queen had kept the news from all, tho she knew that surely Zeus had known with his powers.  She wanted to be alone this time at the birth.  And this she did.  But, now as she returned home...she could feel something was amuck and very very wrong.<br>
There was something going on down in Poseidon's temple.  And something very disturbing in Themiscrya.  Sensing the immediate matter was in the Temple Under the Sea, she appeared in Poseidon's temple, clutching her infant to her bosom protectivly.  Upon seeing Artemis, she quickly got a vision of what had come to pass and her eyes turn to Poseidon.<br>
&quot;Brother.....&quot;, she sighed darkly. &quot;I have long asked that the amazons of Themiscrya not be harmed or bother by any Olympian.  And this is what you do?&quot;  <br>

I sought to win the heart of the maiden and when I told her I would return and she would bear my child, I meant I would make her love me. I did not impose my will upon the maiden but told her what I wished could become of the 2 of us and what we would reap.

He is angrier than he has been in a very long time::<br>

<br>
&quot;Have you ALL forgotten where you are?  This is a Temple of Poseidon.  You DO NOT walk in here and disrespect my brother the way ALL of you have.  Do I agree with that which my brother has done? No.  But the issue has grown beyond that!&quot;<br>
<br>
::He walks right up to Artemis, staring her dead in the eyes with his glowing Purple hues::  <br>
&quot;If you had qualms with Poseidon, You call him up to Olympus.  On Neutral ground for us all.  Yell and scream at him all you want up there.  Not here!  For one thing, prying mortal ears.  Secondly, and more importantly, this is HIS sanctum, his domain.  You do not walk into someone's home and dispresect them!&quot;<br>

::He walks up to Hera now and stares her in the eyes:: <br>

::He now turns his attention to Dawnitha, his eyes glow a bit deeper now:: Next time you walk into a god's Temple, you show them the proper respect!  You don't have to worship him, but you show him the proper respect within his own Temple.  I should strike you dead for your insolence!&quot;<br>

::His gaze now turned to the three Furies:: &quot;And since when was compassion part of your repitoir?  From what I understood you three were into torturing of souls, not in the prtoection racket.&quot;<br>

&quot;Again, do I necessarily agree with what Poseidon has done? No.  Do the Amazons need to worship any god other than the ones they choose to?  No.  But I do expect them at least not to disrespect me or any other god or goddess for that matter!  Poseidon may have overstepped his bounds.  But so have all of you this day!  You have greatly disrespected my brother!&quot;  <br>
