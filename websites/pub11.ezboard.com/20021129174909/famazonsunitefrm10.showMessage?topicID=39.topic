EVERYONE ATTEND!</span><hr size=1> Long tables drapped in purple cloths were filled with foods and drinks. The Fireside was lit giving off a lovely glow. The Cresent Moon was high above the Village. Gabrielle's throne sat proudly on the platform made. Banners were hung everywhere, Lykastian the bear sat next to Gabby's throne and several other bears gathered around the platform as if to gaurd it.<br>
<br>
Gabrielle stood on the platform, she wore her brown Amazon leather halter bra-like top and her short brown Amazon leather skirt. She was bare feet this evening. The tattoo of 'Amazon Queen' in greek lettering upon her shoulder and the karma tattoo on her left foot. The tatoo of a bear on her stomach and the symbol of Artemis tattooed on her wrist.<br>
<br>
A few Amazons began playing ceremonial music.<br>
<br>
The feast was about to begin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Athelfi! Tonight we feast in honor of Lykastia's Newest Princess Zoe!&quot;<br>
<br>
The Amazons cheer. Now all was to do is wait for the others attending then the feast would begin. <p>§Gabrielle§<BR>

EVERYONE ATTEND!</span><hr size=1> Lucky for the different tattoos between Gabrielle and Alysia for as fate would have it they shared the same image. Alysia walked in with the usual two white wolves at her sides. Scythe and Aeceus. The two wolves looked a little surrounded by all the bears, but nothing scared a Scynthian wolf. Like nothing scared a Scynthian amazon.<br>
<br>
Alysia smiled approaching Gabrielle. She wore her short amazon leathers and was barefoot as usual. She wore a golden pendant around her neck with the symbol of a wolf on it. She had many tattoos on her body as well. The symbol of &quot;Amazon Queen&quot; on her right shoulder in Tretmolec Lettering, Two stars on her upper thigh as well as a Gemini symbol, a wolf's dragging claw on her back as well as a Roman/Amazon peace symbol. Each tattoo in honor of her children of course. There was also a mysterious silver heart on her back that was yet to be remembered of.<br>
<br>
Alysia smiled to Gabrielle.<br>

She gave the Amazon salute to Alysia.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tali has Zoe.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gabby turned and searched for Tali, she got the Amazon's attention and motioned for her to bring Zoe over. Tali walked onto the platform and handed the Amazon child to Gabrielle. Tali bowed slightly before Gabby and Aly before going on her way.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vasilissa Alysia, meet Prigkipissa Zoe.&quot;<br>
<br>
She held the child ever so gently as Zoe began to stir only a bit. <p>§Gabrielle§<BR>
