He cuts an eye to the thrown of Zeus. It is but for he Apollo left Olympus. The close minded biggoting adulterating self congradulatory self proclaimed leader of the gods had disgusted the rather liberal Apollo. Apollo loved his father but also disliked him with a passion. How could someone have  reign over all the gods while remaining ignorant and close minded? He had a right mind to take advice of many and plot to over throw him. But such things were unheard of.

<br>
Still smirking, Zeus watched Apollo.  He knew full well that given the opportunity the younger god would attempt to overthrow him.  He smirked because he knew that even on Apollo's best day, he'd never succeed.  It had been tried before and ended in miserable failure for those who made the attempt.<br>
<br>
&quot;So my son, what brings your radiance back to Olympus?&quot;  He finally settled comfortably on his throne.

Things would certainly become much more interesting..as the Gods return to their places on Mt. Olympus, she thought. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/utheerinyes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Erinyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(5/4/01 9:46:23 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Trio of Terror....</span><hr size=1> In a blaze of red flames and wild mist, Alecto appeared. She shook her head wildly as she came to a stop. She smoothed a hand over her wild blonde hair and looked to the Olympians. &quot;A party I see.&quot; She smiled glancing around. &quot;Without Moi?&quot; She held her petite little hand to herself and laughed slightly.<br>
<br>
In a  blaze of blue flames and wild mist, Megaera appeared. She grinned as she crossed her legs sitting on the top of an empty chair perching herself against the rim of it. She ran a hand through her long brown hair and laughed a bit. &quot;But a party is not a party without a Furie.&quot;<br>
<br>
In a blaze of black flames and wild mist, Tisiphone appeared. She unlike her sisters, sat in the corner looking at the aray of Gods on Olympus.<br>
<br>
Alecto smiled as she pushed the red strings on her outfit behind her as she walked over to Apollo dragging her hand lightly across his shoulders as she moved to the other side of the Sun God. &quot;Welcome back Apollo.&quot; She smiled and crossed to the rest of the Gods.<br>
<br>
Megaera hopped down from the chair and moved her way towards Apollo as well merely waving at him with a snicker and a grin. <br>
<br>
They both then walked over towards Hera and bowed politely. &quot;Dear Hera. It is good to see that you are well.&quot; They said in unision. Megaera then looked towards Zeus as she snagged a chalice from one of the others and held it high. &quot;To Apollo's return.&quot; She then downed the liquid smiling.<br>
