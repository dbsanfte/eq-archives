This is the place that she knows.  There is no other place for her to go, it seems.  Skye is too far.  She doesn't understand what is going on.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Hippolyte, help!&quot;<br>
<br>
She is holding herself up by the katana.  The blade is dug deep into the floor, propping her up.  Her form is sliced up, numerous bruises and slash marks.  Blood flows from her freely.  Her features are hardly recognizable, for they have been covered in the scarlet color.  <br>
<br>
Will she answer?  She knows her wrongs, but knows not how to fix them.  It has been so long....there has been too many changes.  Now...she is like a scared child.  She calls out to the one known as her &quot;mother.&quot;  Has she truly given up hope on her?  She hopes not.<br>
<br>
She has been calling for hours.  The blood has formed a giant pool around her.  She knows not what to do, for there has been no sign of her.  There has been no sign of anyone.  She stays, holding her ground.<br>
<br>
There is a figure at the door.  So blurry, but it isn't her.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Who is it?&quot;<br>
<br>
A man.  Dark in clothing, dark in actions.  He approaches her, his sword out.<br>
<br>
&quot;No!  Stay away!  Not again&quot;<br>
<br>
This time she has her sword up and it meets with his.  She may be weak, but her will is strong.  She will not fall again....she will not return to Yomi.  She begins to work, focusing on her skills with the weapon.  His thrusts are getting harsher.  Yes, she scores a few hits, but they are weak and do little damage.  Of course he scores his own, damaging her more.  The clanging of steel continues.  Maybe someone will come....maybe. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/utashamoonlight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tasha Moonlight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#993300>(3/27/01 10:39:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=191.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Save</span><hr size=1> As his sword comes down to cast the final strike...<br>
The blade comes to an abrupt stop. Locked firmly between the blade and the shaft of a Labrys. A sword blade strikes the top of the mans sword forcing it from his hand. Tasha steps between the man and Cuilaech. She keeps herself between the mans blade and pushes him back. She forces him back. Pushes him behind the bar. She whistles into the air and she keeps an eye on the man. A few seconds later her horse bursts into the room with one swift motion Tasha jumps onto his back. She turns the horse picking up Cuilaech<br>
riding toward the man. Leaving her short sword embedded in his shoulder. They ride off into the night heading toward Tasha's house.<br>
     As they stop in front of her house, Tasha climbes down pulling Cuilaech into her arms and carrying her into the house. Carries her to her bed. Lying her down she quickly removes her damaged armour and clothing. She pours water into the basin and cleans her wounds and the blood from her body. Starting with the smallest of the wounds working her way to the most severe. She lies her hands over each one. The wounds quickly disappear and within moments reappear on Tasha.  Seeing that her friend is well. She moves into her spare bedroom. Crawls into bed leaving a trail of blood as she goes. She lies in bed holding her stomach, praying to Artemis that she will not lose her baby before she heals. She falls asleep.<br>

Too many injuries.  Her heart is still intact it seems though.  She pushes herself up and enfolds her body in a scarlet 'blanket' of sorts.  It is not fabric, but merely the air around her discolored.  She walks into Tasha's room.  No, she cares not for any goddess or god anymore.  No, she is not under anyone's authority.  It is her way of doing things.  <br>
<br>
Yes, she still cares.  Yes, she still loves this one, but to fully show it would probably hurt her more.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tasha, honey.  You are wounded.  Sleep.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her hands cover her eyes for a moment, forcing her into a deep sleep.  She knows that this is for the best.  These wounds she takes will kill her for sure, reguardless of the mercy of the gods and goddesses.  The blade was even poisoned.  Why did she have to go and do this.  Reguardless, she must do this.  She weaves a pattern in the air.  The same energy pours from the air, wrapping Tasha in it.  The wounds close, yes, but there will be a price.  There is always a price.  Yet, she will throw herself on the mercy of the cycle.  A soft kiss on her cheek when all wounds are healed and she sits in the lotus position by the door...somehow that katana found itself back in her hands...but now it is in her lap.  No, no one will disturb her tonight.  No, no one will harm her Tasha again.  No, Tasha will not change her mind about her soon-to-be wife.  She simply is here for her.

With her gropwing half goddess powers she found her stepsisters room and went in, seeing her in her bed, wraped in her freinds arms, she walks over to them, knowing that her life is in danger~ Let me heal her ~she says to her friend as she pulls down the covers, Melousa then takes off her furs and climbs onto the bed, hands shaking with worry, she never used her powers like this before and she hopes she does this right, she silently chants to herself as her eyes close, envisioning a white ball of light in the palm of her hands, she spreads it over Tasha, the light seeps into the wounds of her sister and only friend, light shines all through Tasha as Mel chants and rocks back and forth wispering an old incantation in Ancient Greek. Happy with what she has done, she opens her eyes and the white light leaves with a loud crackle.

She is too weak now to fight, so she allows her to pass.  Her katana is still up, ready to strike her down if one single hair on the body before her is even scratched wrong.  She knows no less would be done for her.  Especially under theses circumstances.<br>

&quot;She's mostly healed....I was made sure the child was okay&quot;<br>

The first words spoken all night since the incident.  She does not let her stance down.  She will wait for this person to leave before she sits and lowers her weapon.  She has learned that there are only a few people she can truly trust....and only one that she dares to love...<br>
<br>
she sits now.  That helps.  She also sits, not letting the weapon down however.  She is weakened.  She could strike now, but that is not what she was taught...not by amazon society...not by her friendship. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/utashamoonlight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tasha Moonlight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#993300>(4/13/01 9:54:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=191.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Smiles</span><hr size=1> ::smiles seeing her sister although she has had little time to really get to know her 1/2 sister she is very happy to see her and to feel her healing powers.
