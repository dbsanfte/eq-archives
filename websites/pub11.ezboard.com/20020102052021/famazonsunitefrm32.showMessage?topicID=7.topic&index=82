It was unbelievable that there were those who found such pleasure in the bloodshed of war.  While he was the mightiest of the Olympians, he no longer thirsted for war as the mortal male apparently did.  However, this war was one he'd keep an eye on the happenings.  He'd maintain neutrality, unless one side overstepped the curtesies of of war.  His eyes watched both sides closely.<br>
<br>
Just for good measure, he watched as one of his chosen mortal warlords rode alongside Fogstone and prepared for battle with his warriors.  The cupbearer Ganymede was among the warlord's mortal followers.  Zeus smiled as he watched the boy then thought for a moment how the boy looked out of place on the battlefield.  <br>

((You know you could just post and have fun with it.  Who cares if there are NPCs?  Noone is going to kill, rape, maim or otherwise destroy your character without your permission.  Are your characters so weak that you have to make stipulations like that or you take your toys home?  Just asking, but seems to me it would be a lot more fun if you just went with it and stopped being so pissy about who does what and what you will recognize.  Just a suggestion.)) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenvaria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QueenVaria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/19/01 12:03:20 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ~War~</span><hr size=1> Varia smirks back to DeL. ~You know what I mean,~ she says, fixing an arrow into her bow in preparation.

<br>
She raises a brow as Hypnos launches an energy ball,and seeing that it was going to fall short,she just eyes it,not moving a muscle,pretty much standing there like a squirrel in the middle of a road. And as the energy balls hits the ground it created a cloud of dirt all around her,and as it cleared,she was covered in dirt,and she blinks,and snarls,her pearly whites almost glowing against the dirt caking her face. She brings her left hand up and wripes the dirt from her eyes,then shakes her body fiercly shaking most of the dirt out of her hair and off her being.<br>
<br>
She turns toward the amazons and yells. &quot;Fire the catapalts!!!!&quot; Then realizing...&quot;Oh...wait,we don't have catapalts,do we?&quot; She snickers then turns towards the opposing team. &quot;Spose hand to hand combat will work,and it's always more entertaining.&quot; She clutches her hands into tights fists,the veins in her arms and shoulders exploding,her flesh tearing around her arms and shoulders,and those deadly razor sharp spikes surface. A spike running the length of her arm,starting at the wrist grow from the torn flesh on both her arms. Her shoulders become armored by shorter spikes,even her shoulder blades become armored by the spikes. It was all she needed for now. And she did let out a little wince as her skin tore open,still she wasnt use to this transformation,and some blood did seep from the wounds,atleast until her skin healed around the beginning point of the spikes.<br>
<br>

<br>
Her eyes seem to darken as she looks over at the opposing team,her hair falling once again into her face,but not cutting off her line of vision.A grin once more tugging at her crimson lips. She looks over to Varia and hallers to her. &quot; Hey Varia! Come on,lets get this game started!&quot; She then turns her attention to Hypnos and in a blaze of speed she dukes it across the field,her hair whipping back as she runs. She screams out a war cry as she reaches mid field. So fast she ran picking up her speed,which she'll probolly regret as doing so causes her to lose energy quicker. But then she soon reaches Hypnos and at her full speed,she lowers her right shoulder and rams Hypnos dead on in his chest...... <p>---Everybody Got a sanity------I've got a split personality---</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uiizeliaii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>II Zelia II</A> at: 11/19/01 12:52:08 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenvaria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QueenVaria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/19/01 12:44:38 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lets try to make some damage....bwahahahaha</span><hr size=1> {Am I allowed to join in or do I need to wait for Hippolyte to signal?} <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uiizeliaii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>II Zelia II</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/19/01 12:47:01 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/iizeliaii/images/zel-52.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lets try to make some damage....bwahahahaha</span><hr size=1> ((i dont know if you have to wait for Hipp,zel is basically doing whatever she wants....hehe....)) <p>---Everybody Got a sanity------I've got a split personality---</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamazonvelaska.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amazon Velaska</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/19/01 12:48:11 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/amaz0nbich/images/velaskabich.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lets try to make some damage....bwahahahaha</span><hr size=1> {{ noone has to wait or anyone, everyone join in }} <p>Amazon Velaska ..
