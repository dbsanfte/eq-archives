Her hands running over her black armor, she began to feel the sun upon her.  Being a dark forest guardian, Marpe was unused to being out in the open.  Her eyes glanced to Hippolyte, who was also quiet.  That was unsual she thought to herself.  <br>
Marpe then turned her eyes to searching their surroundings.  She would have to trust on her vision, instead of her ears as she usually did in the dark forests of Themiscrya.  There was too much talking going on around her, to many voices.   Marpe moved her horse away from the pack of amazons.  Closer to the woods, attempting to tune her ears to the trees.  Yet, keeping an eye on her own Queen's safety. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/umarpeamzn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Marpe Amzn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#993300>(8/23/01 5:17:19 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> something in the woods</span><hr size=1> Then there it was, a sound in the woods.

Marpe moved her horse closer to Queen Hippolyte, keeping between her and the hissing forest.  Again, she let out the cry of the blackbird.  Someone would catch on, that it was warning that someone or something was in the woods.  She knew Hippolyte would at least.

<br>
She noticed Scooby's growling but she had already been aware of this and had watched Scooby get off.. this was too bad, she couldn't go back and get him. She reached for her map, pulled it out and was stunned. They seem to move quite quickly... well... they were reptillian people. Delilah called to Alysia, &quot;Gaurd yourself! They are about!&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked at the map.. they were ahead in the woods and were going to be behind us. We were riding into a trap, a circle... This wasn't good... &quot;Alysia! We're slowly being surrounded! Tell the others to pull out their weapons!&quot;<br>
<br>
This would be where the war takes place... in and around this clearing and the woods. The amazons knew these woods though, we'll have a better advantage to the Saurians. Delilah clicked her tongue and her eyes went purple... she had begun muttering.<br>
<br>
This muttering caused a second horse-like tiger to suddenly spring up from the ground and run beside her own. Delilah waved a hand and this unseated Evelyn. Evelyn of them flew onto the second horse-sized tiger. She double-clicked her tongue then gave a low whistle to the second tiger. It moved off to the woods, to the very edge and crouched their, a new seating charm also placed on Evelyn to keep them on the sitting tiger so they could not enter the war, but only watch.  Delilah's eyes glittered a gold color before turning red. Suddenly, to every and any eye that would look Evelyn's way, the section she sat in looked like nothing but old logs that woul be of no help to anyone or anything. Anywho who would look there would not spot Evelyn or her second tiger. So there they would sit, to watch the war.. kind of like front row seats you could say.<br>
<br>
Delilah clicked her tongue to her own tiger and it slowed down a considerable amount. Delilah's eyes, now red, scanned the forests and she could see the many movements. She couldn't tell if this would be the first battle of the war... or the big fight itself.. all she could tell was that... well... they have been closed in and would have to fight all the Saurians to break the trap.<br>
<br>
She drew her sword with her left. She was strong with both arms and they both functioned equally. She narrowed her eyes, the fight... would soon begin. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udelilahtragedy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Delilah Tragedy</A> at: 8/23/01 2:31:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualysiaofscynthia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alysia of Scynthia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 200<br> <font color=#993300>(8/23/01 2:50:13 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Movement in the Woods</span><hr size=1> Alysia turned to look at Delilah as she scanned the woods as well seeing some movements.<br>

She heard a loud... hissing? Her eyes glanced about.

An arrow shot out of nowhere and went whizzin by her head. She clicked her tongue at her tiger and it turned left towards the direction from were the arrow came from.<br>

She twirled her sword in her left hand then moved her right hand to her right thigh and pulle out one of her poisoned darts. She pulled her arm back then, with precise aim, she threw the dart hard and it flew between a few trees and hit one of the Saurian's within the tree.

Eyes wide, she looked up to see the sky filled with arrows. Her tiger had seen this and oddly enough.. it's fur turned into a sort of metal. She had never seen her tiger do this, but she had no time to waste. She had no time to wonder where the first fallen was still alive. She yelled to the other amazons, &quot;ROLIO EZO!&quot; Watch out.. the arrows were beginning to shower down oddly. It didn't seem that the archers where in any particular allignment. This was good. She dodged a couple of arrows and her sword helped in blocking some.<br>
<br>
&quot;POLEMOS KLAIO!!!!&quot; she shouted loudly. The shower of arrows was lessening as she spotted Saurian warriors emerging from the forest....<br>
<br>
This was going to be tough.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ulatraariah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LaTra Ariah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#993300>(8/23/01 3:57:29 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The war</span><hr size=1> Catching arrows and throwing her own daggers at Saurians in trees and such, she was doing fine.
