Hera tries to become steady and speaks to the amazons assembled:::<br>
Amazons and ::she glances at Hipp:: my beloved granddaughter...this day I have done something I pray you all shall forgive me for.  Even tho, I shall never forgive myself.  On this eve, I wed Cupid and Dawn in my temple.  Joined them for eternity.  But, that ::breathes deeply:: is not what I did wrong.  I felt Cupids heart was still not right.  For she had give up her godly powers and self for this love.  As a gift, I returned Cupid's powers and full self.  This upset Mt. Olympus and greater even, Zeus.  For it is not my duty to keep judgement on the Gods or any on Mt. Olympus.  I had chosen to disregard the structure of Olympus.  Zeus has seen fit to hit me with a punishment where it would hurt the most.  :::Hera looked out over the amazons::: He had decided to punish you...the amazons of Themiscrya for my actions.  :::she bites her bottom lip and then slowely her pale gaze moves to Hippolyte's::: I have been given the chance to warn you, in two weeks time, upon the 3rd of February.  Themiscrya will be hit with the rainiest, coldest, hardest winter it has ever seen.  The firewood will be so wet it does not burn. :::She continues to look into Hippolyte's eyes, knowing she deserves Hippolyte's hate::: The huts will sag with ice and the heaviness of a cursed winter.  The ground will be covered with ice and snow and the cattle and horses will be hard pressed to find food that is uncumbered by frost or ice.  :::For once the amazons see Hera tremble.  She cannot stand what she has done to them all::: This shall last until the Spring Equinox of March 20th.  :::With this she actually breaks down in tears and dissappears quickly.  She could not handle this anymore.  She dissappeared to a distant cave on the beaches of the Black Sea.  Unsure of the punishment she would inflict upon herself for doing this to the women she has loved, and the granddaughter she loved as her own child.::: <p>@}}}}>>>>~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Queen</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#993300>(1/21/01 12:13:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=137.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The news</span><hr size=1>  Dawn stood atop her horse's saddle, and screamed, falling to her knees atop the mare.

For Hera giving back what is rightfully someone's!?!  I say to you, Themiscryans.  Fine!!!  So, be it.  You know what?  We will prove to Zeus that WE ARE AMAZONS!  No little snow or ice can weaken us!  We will band together and harded to this punishment.  We are not the weak little women that (Mh)Zeus believes us to be!  Amazons, we have been given two weeks time to prepare.  I want you all to gather in the storerooms all the feeds, foods, wines, water, and other drinks you can.  Go to the villages of the outsiders, and get blankets and other supplies.  We WILL withstand this winter.  We will SURVIVE!  Prove yourselves well...and stand by your athefli! :::Hipp raises a clenched fist::: AMAZONS UNITE! :::Her thoughts quickly move to her first action at hand.  To find Hera.
