The great Poseidon was nearly equal to his brother in power and dignity, and he was revered and worshipped by the ancient Greeks. <br>
<br>
Just don't get him angry, or else beware his deadly Trident!<br>
<br>
Poseidon is the ruler of the sea, often called the &quot;Earth-shaker.&quot; After Zeus, with his brothers and sisters, defeated the Titans and dethroned Cronus, Zeus, Poseidon and Hades drew lots for one of the three realms to rule. Zeus got the heavens and thus became the supreme ruler, Hades got the underworld and Poseidon got the sea.<br>
<br>
Poseidon is very powerful, second only to Zeus himself. Poseidon had a magnificent palace beneath the sea, but spent much of his time participating in the festivities in Olympus with the other gods.<br>
<br>
Poseidon’s wife is Amphitrite, granddaughter of the titan Oceanus.<br>
<br>
Poseidon was never satisfied with his share of the world and once even conspired to dethrone Zeus. But his plot was discovered and in punishment Zeus exiled him to earth. There he was to build the walls of Troy for king Laomedon. He was helped by Apollo, who was also banished from Olympus at that time. Apollo was able to move the heaviest of stones with just the sound of his lyre. After the task was completed Laomedon refused to reward them as promised and that was the chief reason why Poseidon was on the Greek side during the Trojan War.<br>
<br>
Although Poseidon is adored for giving men the first horse, his primary importance was as Lord of the Sea. At his command winds rose and the most violent of storms began, but when he drove in his golden chariot over the water, the storms subsided and tranquil peace followed his wheels. Ancient sailors and warriors would pray and offer tributes to the great Poseidon prior to undertaking a sea journey. <br>
<br>
Both the bull and the horse are associated with Poseidon, but the bull is associated with many other gods as well, so the horse can be considered his animal. He was always depicted carrying, or using, his distinguishing weapon, the trident, a three-pronged spear which he used to shatter and shake anything he pleased, much like his brother Zeus used his thunderbolts. He was always accompanied by his son, Triton, who was half man, half fish. Triton would blow on his seashell to announce Poseidon's arrival.<br>
<br>
When the TITANS were defeated in their war against the OLYMPIANS they were cast into Tartarus, a place that is as far beneath the earth as heaven is above earth. Round Tartarus runs a fence of bronze with gates of bronze, which Poseidon fixed, and there the TITANS were confined.<br>
<br>
Once there was a conspiracy against the rule of Zeus among the other OLYMPIANS and Poseidon, along with Hera and Athena, was part of it. They wished to put Zeus in bonds but Thetis, the Oceanid, freed him and called the mighty Hecatoncheire Briareus, who came to defend Zeus.<br>
<br>
According to the Corinthians this same Briareus acted as adjudicator arbitrating between Helius and Poseidon who had a dispute concerning the lands about Corinth. Briareus assigned to Poseidon the Isthmus of Corinth and the neighbouring lands, and gave to Helius the height above the city (Acrocorinthus).<br>
<br>
A similar dispute, this time for the patronage of Argos, involved Poseidon and Hera. A tribunal of three RIVER GODS: Inachus, Cephisus and Asterion, decided that Argolis would belong to Hera and not to Poseidon. Because of this judgement Poseidon made their waters disappear and they never provide any water except after rain. In summer their streams, they say, are dry except those at Lerna; this may be because Poseidon revealed to Amymone the springs at Lerna when she agreed to yield to him on condition she might have water. Poseidon also inundated many districts in Argolis because the RIVER GODS had decided that the land belonged to Hera and not to him.<br>
<br>
Another disagreement concerning the patronage of lands and cities arised between Poseidon and Athena in relation to Troezen. But Zeus commanded them to hold this city in common and so they did. This dispute took place during the reign of Althepus, king of Troezen, himself son of Poseidon and Leis, the daughter of Orus, who was king before Althepus.<br>
<br>
<br>
Poseidon was the first who came to Attica. With a blow of his trident on the Acropolis, he produced a sea or, as some say, just a well of sea-water that could be seen in the Erechtheum on the Acropolis not far from the outline of the trident on the rock. These were the evidences in support of Poseidon's claim to the land. But Athena, coming after him, planted an olive tree. They fought for the possession of the country but Zeus parted them and appointed the OLYMPIANS as arbiters, and they adjudged the city to Athena, because King Cecrops witnessed that she had been the first to plant the olive tree. Athena called the city Athens after herself but Poseidon, angry at the verdict flooded Attica. However some say that it was Zeus who ajudged Athens to Athena and that Poseidon never flooded the country because Hermes forbade him to do so. In any case in the shrine of Erechtheus there remained preserved a long time an olive tree and a pool of salt water which had been set there by Poseidon and Athena as tokens when they contended for the city. <br>
<br>
Once, Apollo and Poseidon, desiring to put King Laomedon of Troy to the test, assumed the likeness of men and undertook to fortify Troy for wages. But when they had fortified it, he would not pay their wages. Therefore Apollo sent a pestilence, and Poseidon sent a Sea-monster, which snatched away the people of the plain. As oracles foretold deliverance from these calamities if Laomedon would expose Hesione to be devoured by the Sea-monster, he exposed her by fastening her to the rocks near the sea, but Heracles delivered her and she married Telamon.<br>
<br>
On another occasion Poseidon sent another Sea-monster against the Teucrians because Hierax, otherwise a righteous man, was devoted to Demeter and would not honour Poseidon. When Queen Cassiopea boasted of being better than the NEREIDS, these became angry, and Poseidon, sharing their wrath, sent a flood and yet another Sea-monster to invade the land. Andromeda was exposed as a prey to this monster. Poseidon also sent a bull from the sea, and the horses of Hippolytus were frightened and he, entangled in the reins, was dragged to death. <br>

and a god of many roles such as prophecy, truth and light. He was revered by<br>
immortal and man alike, being second in power to the all mighty Zeus.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The great divinities of ancient Greece, a divine family in which there are many members. They were the most important family in Greece you could say, controlling every thing from the sea to live stock. As in every family there is a favorite; one who the family is proud to call one of their own. In the divine family that resides on Mount Olympus, Apollo was perhaps this favorite. From the happenings of his birth, to the occurrences only days after, it seemed that Apollo was destined for greatness.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Apollo, was the son of Zeus and the Titaness Leto who was daughter of the Titans Phoebe and Coeus and twin brother to Artemis Goddess of the Hunt. He was born the best looking male in the cosmos (Aphrodite being the best looking female in the cosmos) but more importantly he was the god of music (he was skilled at singing, the lyre, the flute and he directed the nine Muses) and also of prophecy, purity, colonization, medicine, archery,Fine Arts,poetry,Power(roman), Logic,Reason, dance, intellectual inquiry(question itself), truth,shepherds,seafarring, and religious healing. He also was the god of light, of truth,plague and vindictive justification. He was the carer of herds and of flocks. His sister Artemis was watcher over young woman, and he was watcher of  young men. Many animals were sacred to him including the swan, the dolphin, the crow, the wolf, mice and locusts. Like his sister he had the ability to change himself into any animal at will. He was good an athlete as Hermes, but he was best at archery. Apollo was the first victor of the Olympic Games. Apollo  appears as a young clean shaven male (in my characters case 1<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  with straight sandy blonde hair stopping at his ears (typical bowl cut like thing). His eyes are crystal blue, peaking at a height of 6'2 his body is perfect bearing no piercing nor imperfections such as blemishes or rashes. Upon his head a laurel crown. When he was born he stole the title from Athena as the one to overthrow Zeus. He was second only to his father in power and surpassed all that came before him.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But the story of Apollo's greatness begins but four days after his actual birth! It all began when, Zeus had begun to admire Leto from a far. Being the promiscuous womanizer that he is, Zeus  acted upon his feelings for Leto. As do most of Zeus's love endeavors, (And this one was no different) their courted soon ended in a physical union. Soon after it was apparent that Leto was pregnant with two of Zeus's children. But this was the least of her problems.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hera soon found out about what happened at Zeus's latest get to together and was not at all content. Leto was by now pretty far along and trying to hide herself from Hera, maybe she could pull this off without her knowing! No such luck, Hera was blinded with rage and told Leto (who was about to give birth...it seems all divinities are born prematurely) that she was not to give birth to the children anywhere on earth, neither  on<br>
terra-ferma or an island at sea. Leto roamed the earth from Crete to Asia Minor looking for a proper place to give birth to her children. Leto had to make the dangerous journey to the floating island of Ortygia. There she gave birth to Apollo's twin sister Artemis (Goddess of the Hunt) painlessly. By some mishap, Leto was forced to cross to the neighboring island of Delos. Being only one day old Artemis had to assist in the birth of Apollo whose birth did not go as smoothly as her own. During his birth the island was surrounded by many flocks of swans. Later the swan became one of Apollo's sacred animals.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Apollo considered Delos to be his sacred island, and when he heard of the dragon Python (Who harassed the near by island of Pytho) he quickly decided to slay the beast. Now Apollo was only four days old and his mother insisted that he stay put, ordering Artemis to pay close attention to him and keep him from trouble. Apollo called to the Cyclopes and Hephaestus (God of the Forge) for silver arrows and a silver bow (with matching silver quiver). Apollo soon snuck away from Artemis to rid his own of the dragon. Python was a huge offspring of Gaea (Mother of Earth) it protected the sanctuary of Pytho from its lair besides the Castalian spring while oracles made prophecies.  The four day old Apollo soon met the serpent Pytho and with his little bow and arrow quickly vanquished the monster. Apollo declared himself leader of the oracle and quickly set forth to rid the country side of mass destruction and havoc.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For killing one of Mother Earths children Apollo was punished, having to work for King Admetus in Thessaly, for eight years. Apollo would have to wake up at the crack of dawn and tend to the kings cows until dusk. Now, Apollo was but a young kid at the time and was horrible at the job.( It taught him nothing for he disregarded all of Zeus's other punishments later on in life.) As soon has his punishment was finished Apollo swam back to Pytho in this guise of a dolphin with the priests of Crete on his back. He renamed the island Delphi after one of his favorite animals the dolphin (also sacred to him). He ordered the priests to work for the oracles at the Oracle of Delphi. He also bestowed upon one of the priestesses the divine power of Prophecy. Along with all of this he dedicated a bronze tripod to the temple, on which the blessed priestess &quot;Pythia&quot; made her predictions. From then on in Delphi he was known as Pythian Apollo.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp By now Apollo and Artemis were ten and already doing things that took most gods eons to do. On one of their family excursions Apollo, Artemis, and Leto came to the kingdom of Queen Niobe. Niobe had often boasted that she was fairer than any god. &quot;What madness is this, to prefer god whom you have only heard of to those whom you have seen?&quot; she often said. This got Apollo and Artemis angry enough, but then Niobe started to talk about how she was a better woman than Leto bearing nineteen children instead of only two. She then when on to say that Leto's two children were not even pure children. Artemis was a woman in a males hunting uniform, and Apollo was far to good looking to be a proper man! (Ladies and gentleman we have the worlds first recorded homophobe!) Now this did not go over well with Artemis nor Apollo. A day later they shot down on the nineteen children, for nine days arrows rained upon the children. On the tenth day Apollo and Artemis buried the children themselves. Only two of Niobe's children had survived for they prayed to Leto during the nine days of blood. Amyclas and Chloris survived. Chloris soon married the king of Messenia and her child Nestor was granted an unusually long life by Apollo, his pardon for taking Chloris's siblings.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Apollo was the most eligible bachelor in all of Greece. He was sought after by mortal and immortal alike.  Sadly all of his love endeavors ended in heartbreak. Among his lovers were Cyrene, Cassandra, Coronis and Hecuba. By one mishap or the other, all of those relationships ended in heartbreak. Perhaps it was because none of them truly loved Apollo, they all saw the power in being in a relationship with him. But of all his relation ships none of them were more famous than his everlasting love for the nymph Daphne.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Daphne was Apollo's very first love. But like most loves it was not coincidence that Apollo loved Daphne, it was brought by Eros the God of Desire son of Aphrodite. Apollo saw the boy playing with his bow and arrows; and being himself elated some recent victory, he said to him, &quot;What have you to do with warlike weapons boy? Leave them for hands worthy of them, Behold the conquest I have won by means of them over the vast serpent who stretched his poisonous body over acres of the plain! Be content with your torch child, and kindle up your flames, as you call them, where you will, but presume not to meddle with my weapons.&quot; Eros heard these words, and rejoined, &quot;Your arrows may strike all things else, Great Apollo, but mine shall strike you.&quot; So saying, he took his stand on a rock and drew from his quiver two arrows of different workmanship. One to excite love, the other to repel it. The former was of gold and ship pointed, the latter blunt and tipped with lead. With the leaden shaft he struck the nymph Daphne, the daughter of the river god Peneus, and with the golden one Apollo, through the heart. Immediately the god was seized with love for the maiden, and she disgusted in the thought of loving or marriage. Her delight was like Artemis's; in the woodland sports and in the spoils of the chase.  Her father said to her: &quot;Daughter, you owe me a son-in-law, you owe me grandchildren.&quot; She, hating the thought of marriage said to her father, &quot;Dearest father, grant me this favor, that I may always remain unmarried, like Artemis.&quot; He allowed this but added, &quot;Your own face will forbid it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Apollo loved her, and longed to obtain her hand in marriage. Yet he who gives oracles to all the world was not wise enough to see his own fortunes. He saw her hair flung loose over her shoulders, and said, &quot;If so charming in disorder, what would it be if arranged?&quot; He saw her eyes bright as stars, he saw her lips, and was not satisfied with only seeing them. He admired her hands and arms and her naked shoulders. He followed her; she fled, swifter than the wind. &quot;Stay,&quot; he said, &quot;daughter of Peneus; I am not a foe. Do not flee from me as a lamb flies from a wolf, or a dove the hawk. It is for love I pursue you. You make me miserable, for fear you should fall and hurt on the stones, and I should be the cause. Pray run slower, and I will follow slower. I am no clown, no rude peasant. Zeus is my father, and I am lord of Delphi and Tenedos, and know all things present and future. I am the god of song and the lyre. My arrows fly true to the mark; but alas! An arrow more fatal than my own has struck me in the heart! I am the god of medicine, I know all the virtues of all healing plants. Alas! I suffer a wound for which there is no cure!&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The nymph continues her flight, and left his plea half said. And even as she fled she charmed him. The wind blew her clothes, and her unbound hair streamed loose behind her. The god grew impatient to find his wooing and cooing thrown away, and, sped by Eros gained upon her in the race. It was like a hound pursuing a hare, with open jaws ready to seize, and while the feebler animal darts away, slipping from the very grasp. So flew the god and the virgin-he on the wings of love, and she on those of fear. The pursuer is the more rapid, however, and gains upon her, and his panting breath blows upon her hair. Her strength begins to fail, and, ready to sink to the ground, she calls upon her father the river god: &quot;Help me father! Open the earth to enclose me, or change my form, which has brought me into this danger!&quot; Scarcely able to utter that sentence, her limbs began to stiffen, her bosom began to be enclosed in a tender bark; her hair became leafed; her arms became branches; her foot stuck quick into the earth, as a root; her face became a treetop, retaining nothing of its former self but its beauty remained. Apollo stood amazed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He touched the stem, and felt the flesh tremble under the new bark. He embraced the branches and lavished kisses on the wood. The branches shrank from his lips. &quot;Since you cannot be my wife,&quot; he said&quot; you shall assuredly be my tree. I will wear you for my crown; I will decorate with you my harp and my quiver, and when the great Greek conquerors lead up the triumphal pomp to Athens, you shall be woven into the wreaths for their brows. And, as eternal youth is mine, you also shall be always green, and your leaf know no decay.&quot; The nymph, now changed into a laurel tee, bowed its branches in grateful acknowledgment.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Apollo's contributions to mortals was great. He viewed mortals as devolved forms of the gods themselves. Being the god of Medicine and religious healing, he taught humans to heal their wounds as well as their hearts. Armstrong, himself a physician, says this about Apollo:<br>
&quot;Music exalts each joy, allays each grief,<br>
Expels diseases, softens every pain;<br>
And hence the wise of ancient days adored<br>
One power of physic, melody, and song.&quot; <br>
<br>
Apollo was worshiped throughout all of the known world, at Delphi every four years they held the Pythian Games in his honor. He had many epithets, including &quot;Pythian Apollo,&quot; &quot;Apollo Apotropaeus&quot; meaning Apollo who averts all evil, and &quot;Apollo Nymphegetes&quot; meaning Apollo who looks after the Nymphs. He earned the title Smintheus or Sminthian (from sminthos, meaning rat) and as Parnopius or Parnopian (from parnops, meaning grasshopper).<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As the god of shepherds he also had the cult titles &quot;Lukeios&quot; a form of the work Lykos meaning wolf, by protection the flocks from wolfs, and &quot;Nomius&quot; meaning of pastures, belonging to shepherds. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Being the god of colonists, Apollo influenced his priests at Delphi to give divine guidance, as to where the expedition should proceed. That was during the height of the colonizing era. According to one legend, it was Apollo who helped either Cretan or Arcadian colonists found the city of Troy. This is why Artemis, Leto and Apollo sided with Troy during the Trojan War. Apollo is often called Helios, as Helios was a form of Apollo.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Apollo was also very evident in art, being the subject of many paintings, statues and monuments. He is always depicted as a handsome young man, clean shaven and carrying either a lyre, or his bow and arrows. There are many sculptures of Apollo and one of the most famous is in the central figure from the West pediment of the Temple of Zeus, at Olympia, showing Apollo declaring victory in favor of the Lapiths in their struggle against the Centaurs. One of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world, the Colossus of Rhodes, was actually a stature of Apollo. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The people of Rhodes were particularly fond of him and every year Rhodians as they were called, threw into the sea a chariot and four horses for the use of the Sun, apparently supposing that after riding a whole year across the sky his old chariot and horses must be worn out.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Apollo was patron to the city of Rhodes. The ancient writer Pindar calls Rhodes the Bride of the Sun, because it was the great seat of the worship of the Sun in ancient Greece. A Rhodian inscription of about 220 B. C records public prayers offered by the priests: &quot;To the Sun and Rhodes and all the other gods and goddesses and founders and heroes who have the city and the land of the Rhodians in their keeping.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Many festivals were placed in honor of Apollo. For instance in Delphi they held the Pythian Games, every four years. Also in Delphi was the octennial Delphic Stepterion, in which a boy reenacted the slaying of the Python.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Apollo was the kindest and most just of all the divinities upon Olympus. He was embraced by the mortals as a hero and a respected deity. Son of the all mighty Zeus, and the Titaness Leto, brother to Artemis who delights in arrows. God of many names as well as many things. It seems that Apollo will just continue to amaze and to work himself into the hearts of mortals for all of time. His awsome deeds, from introducing healing to humans, to riding the sun through the sky, will go on being remembered forever. His beauty and majesty is timeless, his heart and soul knows of no bounds Forever he is continue to touch to hearts of immortal and man. The legend of The Great Apollo will forever burn in the hearts of all.<br>

He was Poseidon, one of the twelve Olympian gods, brother of Zeus and Pluto. <br>
<br>
Poseidon, like all his brothers and sisters, lived the first years of his life inside the dark stomach of his father Cronus up until the moment his brother Zeus, with the magical herb of Metis, managed to get them out of their peculiar imprisonment. However, there are also other myths in relation to the birth of the seagod. The ancient poets describe how Rhea also managed to fool her husband in the case of Poseidon. Instead of giving him the infant god to swallow, she gave him a newly born horse wrapped in swaddling clothes. Then, so that the frightening child eater would not hear the cries of the child, Rhea placed it among a herd of sheep, whose bleating drowned the infant's cries. She assigned his upbringing to the Nymph Arne. One day Cronus passed by there because he thought he could hear a child like cry, and asked Arne if there was a child closeby. She answered mockingly, 'how do you expect a child to exist here? Who is going to give birth to it, the goats, the sheep or me, who is an unmarried girl?'. Then an embarrassed Cronus left. <br>
<br>
However, from then on Arne was always on the alert in case the terrifying Titan suddenly returned to her area and found out about the child. If something like this occurred, then Poseidon would end up in his huge stomach, and she wouldn't be better off either. For this reason she called on the Telchines, deities who were similar to the Curetes of Crete, who protected Zeus. Every time the newly born cried, the wild Telchines would begin to dance, to cry out loudly and to bang their spears on the Earth. Among such panic and noise, Cronus could not hear a thing. Along with the Telchines, Oceanis Capheira took up the responsibility to look after the infant god after a request by her aunt Rhea. It is said that the divine demons gave Poseidon his almighty weapon, the trident. However, according to others it was given to him by the Cyclopes. What is more, when Poseidon grew up and became a man he met the sister of his companions, Halia, and fell in love with her. With her he had six sons. Depending on the version about his birth, he is either considered to be younger or older than Zeus. <br>
<br>
During the first years of his life he helped his brothers and sisters dethrone their father and the other Titans and to take authority into their own hands. After this event, the three sons of Cronus decided to divide the world up. Zeus proposed that they should separate the world into three kingdoms, the sky, the sea and the Underworld. Olympus and the Earth remained common to all so that the gods could visit them whenever they wanted to. As all three wanted the sky and none of them naturally wanted to reign for all their life in Hades, they drew lots. Zeus drew first and won the sky. Poseidon drew second and received the sea. Pluto immediately frowned, but quickly accepted his fate and withdrew to the darkness of his kingdom. Poseidon, however, couldn't easily accept Zeus's victory. He reluctantly accepted the result, but from then on he had to oppose and dispute his brother on many occasions, until he accepted his eternal supremacy and almighty power. Therefore, when Zeus ordered him to do something for him and the sea god refused to carry it out, Zeus sent Iris to his palace. Before she left he told her the following: 'Tell King Poseidon that his almighty brother orders him to come to Olympus at once, because he has to assign him a task. Otherwise, my terrifying anger will crush him'. Once he had received the message, and angry Poseidon went to Olympus and tried to convince the other gods that he was equivalent to the father of the gods and the people. 'All mighty Olympians, this situation must be cleared up once and for all. Our mother Rhea and Cronus had three sons, Zeus, Pluto and me. We divided our kingdoms and one of us received the sky, another the darkness of Hades and I received the foamy sea. Yet it is impossible for me to accept Zeus's threats and intimidatory behaviour.' However, the gods looked at each other and without saying a word to the king of the sea, they made him realise that they recognised Zeus as being superior. Then he realised that he would never have their support. <br>
<br>
In another incident he is presented as cooperating with Hera, Athena and Apollo to dethrone Zeus, trying to tie him with invisible chains to the sky. After their unsuccessful attempt, Zeus decided to punish his brother by sending him to work under the service of King Laomedon of Troy. The king assigned the god to build the walls of the city. However, when a year had gone by and Poseidon had finished his task, Laomedon refused to reward him as they had agreed. He even threatened to sell him as a slave. Once he regained his powers he gained revenge on the King and on all his nation. He sent a beast to the Trojan coast, which caused irreparable damage and tore many residents to pieces. The Trojans received a prophesy from an oracle, according to which they had to sacrifice Hesione, daughter of Laomedon, to Poseidon in order to get rid of the beast. The moment the beast was ready to tear the princess asunder, Hercules appeared and saved her. Another difference between Zeus and Poseidon was the attainment of Thetis. Both of the gods were enchanted by the Neraid's charms and wanted to make love to her. However, Mother Earth or Themis, prophesised that the son of Thetis would be much stronger than his father. Therefore, the two brothers fearing the worst, turned their attention elsewhere and decided to marry her with the mortal King of Phthia, Peleus. <br>
<br>
With the passing of time, Poseidon began to accept Zeus's superiority, to show obedience and to offer his help whenever it was needed. He stood by his side during the Battle of the Titans and the Battle of the Giants. He also helped his brother on other occasions. He calmed down the sea so that Zeus could pass with Europe after he had abducted her. He helped Leto find the island of Delos so she could give birth to his children, Apollo and Artemis. Finally, he also supported Io, another lover of Zeus, when the zealous Hera went after her. At a time when Greek cities were being founded, the gods decided that each become the protector of one or more cities. Temples would be erected there so that grandiose festivities and sacrifices could take place in honour of the gods. When a goddess was appointed as protector of a city, it was decided either by the remaining Olympians, by some less important deities or by the King and its residents. Poseidon unfortunately, would never get the city he laid claim to. His battle with Hera for the protection of Argolis is very well known. The gods assigned Inachus and the rivers Cephissus and Asterion as judges. They decided in favour of Hera. Then the ruler of the sea decided to get revenge. So he dried up all the sources of water in Argolis. According to another version he disturbed the sea with his trident, created a huge tidal wave and flooded the country. In the same way Poseidon was forced to concede Aegina to Zeus, Delphi to Apollo, Naxos to Dionysus and Athens to Athena. Furthermore, he had a dispute with Helius over the area of Corinth. Then Briareus who had been assigned as judge gave a coast of Corinth to Helius and the remaining part of the isthmus to Poseidon. Like all the other gods, Poseidon had a majestic palace on Olympus, which had been constructed by Hephaestus. This is where he stayed when he had to attend any important gathering of the gods, where they made important decisions. <br>
<br>
On other occasions he would go to celebrations that were organised on the highest mountain in Greece, either for a wedding of some immortal or for the birth of a new god, or the anniversary of some victory. However, since he was the ruler of the sea and he spent most of his time there, he had a golden palace in its vast sea bed. His beautiful underwater palace was decorated with corals and strange shells. The dark sea bed was lit up by huge glittering diamonds. Thousands of goldfish followed him everywhere and they would make sure that his azure tunic was always well groomed. Two giant sea horses continuously guarded the entrance to the palace every day and night. When the respected leader of the sea bed would leave his palace and rise to the surface of the sea, all the cetacean of the ocean would recognize their leader and move out of the way so that he could pass. The lawful wife of the sea god was Amphitrite, one of Nereus's daughters. When the god was passing through Naxos he came across the Nereids who were playing on the seashore with a colourful ball. Amphitrite stood out from her sisters because of her beauty and grace. Poseidon fell in love with her immediately, so he abducted her and took her to a cave where they got married and made love with each other. <br>
<br>
However, there is another version which describes the pairing of the gods much more eventful. Amphitrite didn't want Poseidon and resisted his advances. She managed to get away by diving into the blue waters of the sea and vanish. He searched all the coasts and caves of the sea in vain. He lifted rocks and dug up the sand of the sea without any success. One day when he was sitting on a rock sad and dejected a dolphin approached him and asked him why he was so depressed. After Poseidon explained, the sea cetacean promised his leader that it would find Amphitrite. The dolphin travelled for many days and found her near Africa in the area of Atlas. Then with coquetry it managed to entice Amphitrite and lead her to Poseidon. In order to thank his messenger, he placed his image among the stars as a constellation. The Nereid gave birth to three children from Poseidon, a son Triton, and two daughters, Rhode and Benthesicyme. <br>
<br>
The sea god had countless extra-marital affairs with goddesses, Nymphs and mortals, and was considered to be the father of some of the most well known bandits of ancient time and many frightening monsters. However, he also left descendants who were honoured heroes, ancestors of significant families and founders of cities. In relation to this he was more luckier than his brother Zeus. Amphitrite was not jealous of her husband like Hera. There is only one myth about the sea goddess gaining revenge. At one time when Poseidon fell in love with the Nymph Scylla, Amphitrite threw magical herbs into the spring in which she bathed, and changed the exquisite daughter into a disgusting monster. When Demeter was searching the world to find her daughter Persephone, that had been abducted by Pluto, Poseidon was madly in love with her. In her attempt to avoid Poseidon she transformed herself into a mare and hid among the horses of Oncus. The god was not deceived by her trickery, so he transformed into a stallion and made love to her without her knowing. An infuriated Demeter went to bathe in the waters of river Ladon in order to clean herself of this awful sin. From this strange union a daughter was born. Those who weren't familiar with Demeter's rituals, trembled to say her name. That is why they called her mistress or Despoena. However, a horse was also born, Arion. This was a marvellous animal. His exceptional speed saved Adrastus during the expedition of the Seven against Thebes. <br>
<br>
The god is also said to have had a similar amorous adventure with Medusa. She belonged to the generation of the Centaurs and was exceptionally beautiful. Once Poseidon came up to Earth and roamed the green valleys of Thessaly, and he met Medusa. As he couldn't resist his erotic desires, he transformed into a horse, because there was no other way he could make love to her. In Thessaly there was a temple of the virgin Athena. The goddess was enraged that such an unholy sin had taken place in one of her temples. However, she could not punish the culprit because was an immortal god and in fact belonged to an older generation than herself. For this reason she took it out on Medusa by changing her into a frightening monster, who instead of having hair had serpent locks. It was Perseus that later got rid of Medusa. From the affair with Poseidon, Medusa gave birth to Chryasor, father of the three-bodied giant Geryon, and the winged-horse Pegasus. <br>
<br>
However, it was impossible for the amorous god not to make love to Mother Earth, the most fertile goddess, although she was his grandmother. From their union Earth gave birth to a giant, Antaeus. It is said that he reigned over Libya. Whichever foreigner stepped on the soil of his country was doomed to die. The frightening Giant would challenge the stranger to a duel knowing that he would win. Indeed, he would dedicate the craniums of his victims to his father. Antaeus was invulnerable as long as he was touching his mother, Earth. At the time Hercules was looking for the golden apples of the Hesperides, he passed by Libya, fought with the Giant and strangled him by lifting him onto his shoulders. Poseidon was also considered to be the father of another beast, Busiris, who lived in Egypt and killed all the visitors to his country. However, in the end he met the same fate as Antaeus. He was killed by Hercules. Even Amycus was regarded as son of the sea god and the Nymph Melia. He lived in Vithynia and killed all those that travelled past. Polydeukis put an end to his injustices when he arrived there with the other Argonauts. It is even said that the handsome and brave hero did not kill the giant, but made him swear in the name of his father that he would never again kill a visitor. <br>
<br>
Most of the bandits that Theseus killed on his way from Troezen to Athens were children of Poseidon. Sciron, Sinis, Procrustes and Cercyon met a terrible death in the same way that they tortured travellers, after they had robbed them. According to a myth Poseidon made love to his grandaughter Alope, the daughter of Cercyon and with her had a son, Hippothous, who gave his name to the Hippothoudian race of Attica. The most well known giant son of the god was Cyclop Polyphemus, from his affair with the Nymph Thoosa. He was not related to the namesake sons of Earth. He represents blind and brutal power which is devoid of any sense of logic. Homer describes his sufferings from Odysseus, who fooled him by saying that he was called Kanenas(No one). For this action, Poseidon persecuted the King of Ithaca, during the ten-year journey to his homeland. Cycnus was considered to be the son of the sea god and Scamandrodice. He lost his life after a long battle with Achilles and was transformed into the bird of the same name (Swan). In addition, the Giant Orion came from the affair with Euryale, daughter of Minos. He gave his son the ability to walk on the waves of the sea. Finally, according to the myth, Aloades, Otus and Ephialtes were children of the god, from his affair with Iphimedeia. <br>
<br>
The fatherhood of many monsters and giants is attributed to Poseidon. When he wanted to get revenge on some mortal he would send various monsters to cause destruction. We have already referred to the monster he sent to Troy to gain revenge on King Laomedon. Once, the Nereids complained to their leader that Cassiopeia, Queen of Ethiopia, boasted that she was more beautiful than them. A furious god sent a monster to the coast of her country, which caused great catastrophes. A prophesy from the oracle said that the nation would be relieved of this misfortune, only if King Cepheus sacrificed his daughter Andromeda. However, at the moment the monster was ready to tear the beautiful princess to pieces, Perseus arrived with winged sandals and saved her. The god's adventures with Danaid Amymone are also very well known. After Poseidon had dried up the area of Argos to gain revenge on those who chose Hera, Amymone went looking for water in the forest. However, she was violently attacked by a certain Satyr. In order to save her, he struck Satyr with his trident and killed him. Then he struck a rock and caused the Lerna spring to flow continuously. His love affair brought him a son, Nauplius, who gave his name to the well known city in the Peloponese. In addition, one of the most significant heroes of ancient time, Theseus, was considered to be the son of Poseidon and Aethra. Poseidon had met her on the island of Thera. With Melanippe the sea god had twin sons, Boeotus and Aeolus, who later became the famous heroes of Boeotia and Aeolia respectively. <br>
<br>
His affair with Tyro is also significant. She was in love with the most beautiful river, Enipeus. She would walk along its banks all day waiting to see him. Poseidon who had fallen for the young lady transformed himself into the form of Enipeus and made love to her. They had two sons, Pelius and Neleus. Pelius reigned over Thessaly and Neleus settled down in Messenia and founded the city of Pylus. Poseidon also made love to Neleus's wife, Chloris, and gained a son called Periclymenus, and gave him the ability to transform into whatever animal he desired. From Cleite he gained Atlas, Melantho gave birth to Delphus, who gave his name to Delphi, Corcyra gave birth to Phaeax, and Rhode bore him Ialyssus, Cameirus and Lindus, who gave their names to the three most important cities of Rhodes. As the god of the sea, Poseidon was responsible for the heavy rough seas and torrential downpour that he caused with his trident, but also for the calm sea and safe voyages of sailors. For this reason the latter regarded him as their protector. Moreover, immediately after the Argonauts had successfully completed their expedition they dedicated their ship, the fast travelling Argo, to Poseidon. However, fishermen also prayed and made sacrifices to the god so that he would bring them good fish. The ancient Greeks believed that Poseidon tamed horses, and for this reason honoured him with horse races. Gifts that were usually sacrificed to him were horses and bulls. Fishermen would sacrifice fish. The sea god was worshipped all over the Greek state. Temples existed at most capes, like Sunium, Taenarus, Maleas, and elsewhere. Apart from the trident, other symbols of the god were fish, in particular tuna, the dolphin and less commonly known were the bull and horse.<br>

After deposing their father Cronus, Poseidon, Zeus, and Hades shot dice in a helmet for lordship of the world. Zeus won the sky, Hades the underworld, and Poseidon the sea.<br>
The rather surly and quarrelsome Poseidon is equal to his brother Zeus in dignity, but not in power. He built an underwater palace and large stables where he kept white chariot horses with golden manes and brazen hooves. Whenever the horses drew Poseidon in a golden chariot, storms ceased and dolphins rose playfully around the chariot.<br>
<br>
Needing a wife who would be at home in the sea, he approached Amphirite the Nereid. She found Poseidon repugnant and fled, but he sent one Delphinus to plead his case. Delphinus did so well pleading, that Amphirite yielded and consented to the marriage. Gratefully, Poseidon set Delphinus's image among the stars as the constellation, the Dolphin.<br>
<br>
Amphirite bore him three children. She was jealous of his various love affairs, once changing a rival into a barking monster with six heads and twelve feet.<br>
<br>
Poseidon once claimed possession of Attica by striking his trident into the Acropolis at Athens, and causing sea water to gush out. Athena took possession by planting the first olive tree there. Poseidon, in a rage, challenged her to single combat, but Zeus interposed. Zeus ordered them to submit the dispute to arbitration. They appeared before a divine court, consisting of their fellow deities. After testimony was given the vote was taken: the gods voted for Poseidon (Zeus abstained), and the goddesses voted for Athena. Thus, by a majority of one, the court ruled Athena had right to the land, having given the better gift.<br>
<br>
So vexed was Poseidon that he sent huge waves against Athens. To appease Poseidon's wrath, the women of Athens were deprived of their vote.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
From the Iliad, Book XIII, we have the following description of Poseidon inspiring the Greeks, hard pressed by the Trojans.<br>
He had climbed up from the salt sea, and now he pitied Akhaians beaten down by Trojans. Rancor within him deepened against Zeus. Then from the stony mountain down he went with mighty strides; a tremor shook the crags and forest under Poseidon's immortal feet. Three giant steps, then four, and he was home at Aigai, where his golden chambers glimmer in the green depth and never wash away. Here he entered; into his chariot shafts he backed his racing team with golden manes, put on his golden mantle, took his whip of pliant gold, stepped up into his car, and rolled out on the waves. Great fish beneath him gamboled from every quarter of the deep, aware their lord rode overhead; in laughter whitecaps parted, and the team full tilt airily drew unwetted the axle-tree; with leap on leap they bore him toward the beachhead. There is a cavern deep in the deep sea midway between the rocky isle of Imbros and Tenedos: here he who shakes the islands drove his horses down, unharnessed them, tossed them heavenly fodder, looped their hocks with golden hobbles none could break or slip-- that they should abide here their lord's return; and off he went to the Akhaian army. Now like a storm or prairie fire, swarming steadily after Hektor son of Priam, the Trojans roared as one man--on the verge, they thought, of capturing the Akhaian ships and dealing death to the best men around them. But now from the deep water, girdler of earth and shaker of earth, Poseidon came to arouse new spirit in the Argives. Kalkhas he seemed, with his unwearied voice, addressing first those two, fiery as he, the men named Aias: Aias and Aias, fight to save the Akhaian Army! Joy of action is what you must remember, and have done with clammy dread. Elsewhere I do not fear the free spear-arms of Trojans, though they've crossed our big rampart in force. They can be held, all of them, by Akhaians! Only here, in this one place, I am most afraid it will go badly for us. Here this madman, Hektor, like a conflagration leads them, bragging he is a child of almighty Zeus. I wish you were inspired by some god to hold the line hard, clamped hard here, you two, rallying others: you could block and turn his whirlwind rush away from the long ships, even if the Olympian sets him on. The god who girdles earth, even as he spoke, struck both men with his staff, instilling fury, making them springy, light of foot and hand. Then upward like a hawk he soared--a hawk that, wafted from a rockpoint sheer and towering shoots to strike a bird over the plain: so arrowy in flight Poseidon left them. The son of Oileus knew his nature first and turned to say to the son of Telamon: That was one of the gods who hold Olympos, here in the seer's shape telling us to fight abaft the ships. It was not Kalkhas, not the reader of birdflight; from his stride, his legs as he went off, I knew him for a god. The gods are easily spotted! As for me, I feel more passion to do battle now; I tingle from the very soles of my feet to my finger tips! <br>

Son of Kronos and Rheia, brother of Zeus, Ares, Hestia, Demeter and Hera, Poseidon is one of the six original Olympians. His mission is to give voice to the earth. Poseidon was commonly called the earth shaker and the earth encircler in The Iliad and The Odyssey of Homer. He pounds and shakes the earth and sea with his wrath and pleasure and answers to no one, except Zeus.<br>
<br>
His kingdom is the vast sea which he has populated with creatures of his own design. He rides the waves in a chariot drawn by dolphins but, curiously enough, his most honored creation is the horse.<br>
<br>
One story tells of some very clever mortals who devised a competition between the divine Athene, daughter of Zeus, and Poseidon, brother of Zeus. The contest would be for the two immortals to devise cunning gifts for the mortals, they, in turn, promised to show eternal gratitude to the victor. Poseidon devised the horse and Athene created the olive tree. Athens was named after the contest winner but Poseidon’s gift of the horse literally change the shape of the ancient Greek world.<br>
<br>
Poseidon in The Iliad<br>
As the Trojan War was entering it’s most bloody phase, Poseidon, against the strict orders of Zeus, entered the fray. He went through the ranks of the strong-grieved Achaians and urged them to have courage and to lust for victory over the Trojans, who seemed to be winning the war.<br>
         Zeus had been seduced by Hera and was lounging in the afterglow of love on (Mount) Ida when he heard Poseidon bellowing and screaming from the battlefield in the valley below. Zeus had warned the immortals to stay away from Troy and now he could see that Hera had tricked him and Poseidon had disobeyed him. Zeus contained his anger and did not lash out at his brother. He sent Iris, the storm-footed messenger instead. She warned Poseidon off the battlefield and Poseidon quickly agreed to withdraw but he was defiant. He said he would leave because of his respect for Zeus but not because of fear.<br>
<br>
Poseidon in The Odyssey<br>
The rewards and punishments that Poseidon, and the other Olympians, visit on their friends and enemies are as fair or harsh as Zeus will permit. As an example: Odysseus blinded Poseidon’s son and received an epic punishment. Actually, if Odysseus had simply blinded Polyphemos he might have been forgiven, but Odysseus went too far, he added insult to injury. He, and his family, paid dearly for his transgression.<br>
         Polyphemos was a Cyclops, one of the ’wheel-eyed’ giants who assisted Hephaestus at his forge. Polyphemos was the son of Poseidon and the sea nymph Thoosa. When Odysseus came to Polyphemos’ cave, he and his shipmates were shocked to find that Polyphemos was a man eater. Polyphemos thought he had the puny sailors trapped so he let his guard down. Odysseus relaxed Polyphemos with some potent wine and clever talk, then sprang upon the Cyclops with a burning spear. The monster was blinded as his eye was boiled in the socket. Odysseus made his escape but, in his pride, he turned and taunted Polyphemos with cruel insults. Poseidon would not forgive the indignity that Odysseus had visited upon his son and Zeus could not save Odysseus from Poseidon’s wrath. Poseidon caused Odysseus and his family constant misery but he did not kill the haggard wanderer, he just kept driving him away from his home and thus, his happiness.<br>
         On one occasion, (The Odyssey, 5.281) Poseidon found the resourceful Odysseus on a raft within sight of land. The sea and the wind rose at Poseidon’s command and with his trident, he staggered the sea and let loose the storm blasts against Odysseus and his tiny raft. Before the raft was smashed to splinters, a sea goddess, Leukothea, saw Odysseus and gave him her veil as protection from drowning but Odysseus was afraid that this was just another one of Poseidon’s tricks. He waited until the raft sank below the crashing waves before he accepted the goddesses help and began the three day swim to the foreign shore. Satisfied that harm but no death had befallen our cursed hero, Poseidon turned away from the long-suffering Odysseus and made his way to his palace.<br>
<br>
Poseidon is most often confused with the Roman god, Neptune.<br>

Homer: Iliad 15.155 <br>
When she had thus spoken queenly Hera returned again [150] and sate her down upon her throne; and the twain sprang up and sped forth upon their way. To many-fountained Ida they came, mother of wild beasts, and found Zeus, whose voice is borne afar, seated on topmost Gargarus; and about him a fragrant cloud was wreathed. The twain then came before the face of Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, [155] and at sight of them his heart waxed nowise wroth, for that they had speedily obeyed the words of his dear wife. And to Iris first he spake winged words: “Up, go, swift Iris; unto the lord Poseidon bear thou all these tidings, and see thou tell him true. [160] Bid him cease from war and battle, and go to join the tribes of gods, or into the bright sea. And if so be he will not obey my words, but shall set them at naught, let him bethink him then in mind and heart, lest, how strong soever he be, he have no hardihood to abide my on-coming; [165] for I avow me to be better far than he in might, and the elder born. Yet his heart counteth it but a little thing to declare himself the peer of me of whom even the other gods are adread.”<br>
<br>
So spake he, and wind-footed, swift Iris failed not to hearken, but went down from the hills of Ida to sacred Ilios. [170] And as when from the clouds there flieth snow or chill hail, driven by the blast of the North Wind that is born in the bright heaven, even so fleetly sped in her eagerness swift Iris; and she drew nigh, and spake to the glorious Shaker of Earth, saying: “A message for thee, O Earth-Enfolder, thou dark-haired god, [175] have I come hither to bring from Zeus, that beareth the aegis. He biddeth thee cease from war and battle, and go to join the tribes of gods, or into the bright sea. And if so be thou wilt not obey his words, but shalt set them at naught, he threateneth that he will himself come hither to set his might against thine in battle; [180] and he biddeth thee avoid thee out of his hands; for he avoweth him to be better far than thou in might, and the elder born. Yet thy heart counteth it but a little thing to declare thyself the peer of him, of whom even the other gods are adread.”<br>
<br>
<br>
Homer: Iliad 15.184<br>
Then, stirred to hot anger, the glorious Shaker of Earth spake unto her: [185] “Out upon it, verily strong though he be he hath spoken overweeningly, if in sooth by force and in mine own despite he will restrain me that am of like honour with himself. For three brethren are we, begotten of Cronos, and born of Rhea,--Zeus, and myself, and the third is Hades, that is lord of the dead below. And in three-fold wise are all things divided, and unto each hath been apportioned his own domain. [190] I verily, when the lots were shaken, won for my portion the grey sea to be my habitation for ever, and Hades won the murky darkness, while Zeus won the broad heaven amid the air and the clouds; but the earth and high Olympus remain yet common to us all. Wherefore will I not in any wise walk after the will of Zeus; nay in quiet [195] let him abide in his third portion, how strong soever he be.And with might of hand let him not seek to affright me, as though I were some coward. His daughters and his sons were it better for him to threaten with blustering words, even them that himself begat, who perforce will hearken to whatsoever he may bid.”<br>
<br>
[200] Then wind-footed swift Iris answered him:“Is it thus in good sooth, O Earth-Enfolder, thou dark-haired god, that I am to bear to Zeus this message, unyielding and harsh, or wilt thou anywise turn thee; for the hearts of the good may be turned? Thou knowest how the Erinyes ever follow to aid the elder-born.”<br>
<br>
[205] Then answered her again Poseidon, the Shaker of Earth:“Goddess Iris, this word of thine is right fitly spoken; and a good thing verily is this, when a messenger hath an understanding heart. But herein dread grief cometh upon my heart and soul, whenso any is minded to upbraid with angry words [210] one of like portion with himself, to whom fate hath decreed an equal share. Howbeit for this present will I yield, despite mine indignation; yet another thing will I tell thee, and make this threat in my wrath: if in despite of me, and of Athene, driver of the spoil, [215] and of Hera, and Hermes, and lord Hephaestus, he shall spare steep Ilios, and shall be minded not to lay it waste, neither to give great might to the Argives, let him know this, that between us twain shall be wrath that naught can appease.”<br>
<br>
So saying, the Shaker of Earth left the host of the Achaeans, and fared to the sea and plunged therein; and the Achaean warriors missed him sore.<br>

Stats &amp; Facts<br>
<br>
<br>
Poseidon is the ruler of the sea. <br>
Poseidon is credited with having created the horse. <br>
His signature weapon is the trident, and he was commonly called &quot;Earth-shaker.&quot; <br>
Poseidon's Roman name is Neptune.<br>
<br>
Birth<br>
Poseidon is a brother of Zeus, the son of Cronus and Rhea. Poseidon was essential in the overthrow of Cronus, and used his trident to capture him. The three brothers, Poseidon, Zeus and Hades, then divided the world among themselves; Poseidon got the sea, Zeus got the sky, and Hades got the underworld. The land was fair game for all.<br>
<br>
Lovers &amp; Children<br>
Poseidon originally wanted to marry the Nereid, Thetis, but was warned that a son born to them would overthrow him. So, he married Amphitrite. She initially ran to the Atlas Mountains, but Poseidon sent a messenger, a dolphin named Delphinus, to convince her to come back. The two eventually became parents to Triton, Rhode, and Benthesicyme.<br>
<br>
Like Zeus, Poseidon wasn't very good at being faithful. He and Demeter had two children; Despoena, a nymph, and Arion, a wild horse. He is also the father of Halirrhothius, Orion, Parnassus, Cycnus (who was killed by Achilles), and Eumolpus. He also has two children with Aphrodite: Rhodus and Herophilus. He is also the father of Polyphemus, the Cyclopes.<br>
<br>
Under the Sea<br>
It is said that Poseidon rode a golden chariot pulled by white horses. At his approach, storms ceased and sea creatures frolicked about the chariot. He had a beautiful palace under the sea, but was more often found on Olympus. The trident he carried was capable of creating terrible storms and shaking the earth. <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uposeidonkofc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poseidonkofc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 262<br> <font color=#993300>(12/18/01 5:30:40 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://web.uvic.ca/grs/bowman/myth/images/haifa/h89.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Poseidon- continued</span><hr size=1> Poseidon was the middle son of Cronus and Rhea and older than Hera. He was an Olympian. He drew the sea for his lot when the three brothers picked lots for kingdoms. He took the sea from Nereus who willingly retired. He married one of The Old Man of the Sea’s, which Nereus is sometimes called, fifty daughters, this Nereid was Amphitrite and bore her husband her only son Triton, who was a merman and blew in his conch shell. Poseidon, as Hera, pre-dates Zeus. By the very ancient people he was a fertility god and a patron of herdsmen. His emblem is the trident or three pronged spear which could cause typhoons, hurricanes, and earthquakes. This made him a god of all three of these disasters too. Like Zeus who he was very similar to, Poseidon had numerous wives and children which include Polyphemus the Cyclops in the Odyssey, and Pegasus by Medusa. Poseidon was also swallowed by his father like all his siblings except Zeus. His animal is the horse.<br>
<br>
Poseidon is the brother of Zeus and Hades. After the overthrow of their father, Cronos, he drew lots with Zeus and Hades to decide who would rule over what part of the world. Poseidon's prize was to become the god of the sea, and therefore he was widely worshipped by seamen. Poseidon was the secondmost powerful of the gods, second only to Zeus. He was very quarrelsome, greedy, and had many disputes with other gods when he tried to take over their cities. Poseidon was known for creating the horse. Poseidon's weapon and symbol is the trident, which can shake the earth and shatter any object. He was well-liked by some, but not all. <br>
<br>
<br>
So spake he vauntingly, and queenly Hera had indignation thereat; she shook herself on her throne and made high Olympus to quake, [200] and to the mighty god Poseidon she spake, saying:“Ah me, thou Shaker of Earth, wide of sway, not even hath the heart in thy breast pity of the Danaans that are perishing. Yet in thine honour do they bring to Helice and Aegae offerings many and gracious and hitherto thou didst wish them victory. [205] For did we but will, all we that are aiders of the Danaans, to drive back the Trojans and to withhold Zeus whose voice is borne afar, then, in vexation of spirit, would he sit alone there upon Ida.”<br>
<br>
Then, his heart sore troubled, the lord, the Shaker of Earth, spake to her:“Hera, reckless in speech, what a word hast thou spoken! [210] It is not I that were fain to see us all at strife with Zeus, son of Cronos, for he verily is mightier far.”<br>
<br>
On this wise spake they, one to the other; and now was all the space that the moat of the wall enclosed on the side of the ships filled alike with chariots and shield-bearing men [215] huddled together: and huddled they were by Hector, Priam's son, the peer of swift Ares, now that Zeus vouchsafed him glory. And now would he have burned the shapely ships with blazing fire, had not queenly Hera put it in Agamemnon's mind himself to bestir him, and speedily rouse on the Achaeans. [220] So he went his way along the huts and ships of the Achaeans, bearing his great purple cloak in his stout hand, and took his stand by Odysseus' black ship, huge of hull, that was in the midst so that a shout could reach to either end, both to the huts of Aias, son of Telamon, [225] and to those of Achilles; for these had drawn up their shapely ships at the furthermost ends, trusting in their valour and in the strength of their hands. There uttered he a piercing shout, calling aloud to the Danaans:“Fie, ye Argives, base things of shame fair in semblance only. [230] Whither are gone our boastings, when forsooth we declared that we were bravest, the boasts that when ye were in Lemnos ye uttered vaingloriously as ye ate abundant flesh of straight-horned kine and drank bowls brim full of wine, saying that each man would stand to face in battle an hundred, aye, two hundred Trojans! whereas now can we match not even one, [235] this Hector, that soon will burn our ships with blazing fire. Father Zeus, was there ever ere now one among mighty kings whose soul thou didst blind with blindness such as this, and rob him of great glory? Yet of a surety do I deem that never in my benched ship did I pass by fair altar of thine on my ill-starred way hither, [240] but upon all I burned the fat and the thighs of bulls, in my eagerness to lay waste well-walled Troy. Nay, Zeus, this desire fulfill thou me: ourselves at least do thou suffer to flee and escape, and permit not the Achaeans thus to be vanquished by the Trojans.”<br>
