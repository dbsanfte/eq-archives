She bows, and hands the Queen a scroll, then leaves.<br>
<br>
Chiara unwraps the scroll and begins to read:<br>
<br>
&quot;Queen Chiara,<br>
I have a girl I&quot;m sending to you for training. She should be arriving a day or two after this messenger. I know it's rather short notice,  but you know how difficult it is to get a reliable messenger to go all they way up in the mountians where your tribe is. She's a little headstrong, and a bit on the spoiled side, but I think you will be able to deal with her quite handily. <br>
<br>
Thanks for helping me out.&quot;<br>
<br>
At the bottom of the scroll, instead of a signature, was a wax seal with the emblem of the High Priestess of Iris: A rainbow.<br>
<br>

<br>
[Three days later]<br>
<br>
Moirai, having walked all the way from Athens to the Light forsaken lands of the amazons, is a day later than scheduled. And she was mad as a hornet. <br>
<br>
Her white Priestess gown had gotten torn. It was the only thing she was allowed to wear, and it was torn. She hoped the tribe she was supposed to meet had a decent seamstress. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I'll be lucky if I find someone who doesn't wear something besides flea ridden leather, let alone anyone who can sew such a fine garment.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
She wasn't supposed to be here. She was supposed to be living with a nice noble family in Athens, or Thrace, or even Rome, not in some heathen village, where they still cooked their meat over and open fire in the floor. Where they lived in huts and wore leather and feathers and had never heard of baths or combs or SHOES!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I am not going to stoop to that level of impoverishment. I am a Priestess of Iris.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
She reached the rim of the valley that the village of Marpesia was located in, and stopped. Even from a distance she could tell that it was worse than she had imagined. <br>
<br>
Steeling herself, she continued walking down into the valley, towards the village.<br>

And while the Queen *is* well groomed and dressed, Moirai sees none of that. All she sees before her is exactly what she expected to see: an uncivilized savage. <br>

Oblivious to her own state of disarray, she glares contemptously at the woman.<br>

<br>
&quot;In the servants' quarters, perhaps.  I am Queen Chiara, of this tribe.  Understand one thing, girl: if you endanger even one of my women, I will send you back to your temple a failure.  No, that isn't exactly right.  Your own behavior will have made you a failure.&quot;   Satisfied with that statement, Chiara indicates the path they will follow to Marpesia.<br>
<br>
&quot;As for why no one had been sent to meet you... you're an adult wether you act like it or not.  There are also several Queens of other tribes present, and frankly compared with them you aren't all that important a visitor.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Queen is fully aware that what she's said will anger Moirai.  It's also the first step in Chiara's method of breaking down a badly formed ego so a truer one can be built.  She starts down the path, not looking to see if Moirai is following or not.  <br>

She sat there for a good long while, silently pondering why she shouldn't just sit there forever, or at least until she died. She would never get along in this place, and if she didn't end up getting killed by some wild boar or some other such creature, surely that nasty Queen would do it for her. <br>
<br>
Finally she sighed, and got up. She walked to the door, and opened it, without looking at the woman standing there.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uprincessdoriana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PrincessDoriana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#993300>(10/16/02 12:43:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm55.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Stubborn Princesses</span><hr size=1>      When the door opened, Dori smiled, quite pleased with herself.

She smiles at the young woman before her and extends a hand. She has been trying to act a little mmore out of her shell of late, and trying to get along better with her amazon sisters.<br>
&quot;My name is Naiba Indrani.&quot; her voice is soft as she speak, and very hard to hear. &quot;How are you on this day Ms Moirai?&quot;<br>
Anyone can tell from the way that she is talking that Naiba is indeed a recluse, and most would find it weird that she is out talking to anyone... <p><center>

<br>To this ancient land, the passing of 85 years must seem like<br> but an instant in time… but for us is it the distance of <br>human life. Thus we come to this place at this hour, on<br> this day to observe not only a dawn, but a dusk. For <br>dusk has all but fallen on that world in which our nations<br> spirit was born. Soon the story of ANZAC, which forever joins the<br> people of Australia and New Zealand, will pass gently from memory into <br>history. Soon the fire struck here will be ours to tend. Soon<br> it's record, once written on pages wet with tears will be ours<br> alone to guard, ours to cherish, ours to live.

Spoken on ANZAC day, 2000

     She walked over to the table Moirai was eating at and sat down watching her, &quot;Athens huh?  I've been there once, didn't get to see much, I was rather young, do you have any good stories about Athens?&quot;<br>
