<br>
         Please forgive me for not being able to get this out, however I have ran into many situations in my quest for knowledge which caused my failure to right to you. <br>
         So many odd and wondrous things I have experienced and yes my thirst for the knowledge of what I am has been quenched but not yet profiled. I found whom I was seeking, my brother whom I have learned has grown mad in my opinion he seems obsessed with his divine duty that has been bestowed upon him bye a greater power that he calls our master, whom had granted us with these powers. It was not only him that I had learned from but also the experience I have had during my quest.<br>
<br>
         First there was the incident with the wolves, as I was traveling north of Themiscrya, at the begging of my journey I herd a cry within the Forrest and to my surprise I discovered a pack of wolves attacking an injured white mare. I felt an incredible sense of anger as I witnessed the wolves so coldly calculating their attack upon the defenseless and beautiful beast and I took it upon myself to rescue it from the wolves. I charged the pack as they were about to move in for the kill and then I became the object of there attack. Battling with wolves was a bit different from Centaurs. They were quick but I was faster, I was cut, scratched and bit. I killed one wolf but the odd thing was I had done it with my bare hands and afterward I stood up and to my surprise I was face to face with the others. They approached me at first all barring there fangs and that wild, unforgiving eye. Then as my own expression of anger, intensity, that defying glare that challenged them, in that look the wolves started backing away, there own expressions faded to scared and then they ran. I then attended to the mare aiding it; cleaning and dressing its wound's then set up camp for the night. All was quiet except for the sounds of the forest. The mare however showed much affection and you have no idea how stupid one feels when trying to explain to a animal that they are not allowed to touch in any manor. Then late at night as I was starving I sensed movement, I jumped to me feet grabbing my weapon's to ready myself. It was the same wolves from before and with them they dragged the corpse there fresh kill. They had brought it to me, showing no sign of aggression in them. I had made friends with animals, I asked myself how a dozen times yet no answers, and as I thought about as I prepared a feast for myself over the fire, possibility's came to mind. Perhaps they sensed some dominance within me, or perhaps they sensed a sign of kin in my eye's, when I glared back at them as coldly as they were starring at myself. Or was it a odd charisma between the wild and I. Or was it fear? I have taken all possibilities into consideration and  combined all possible answers and within them all mixed within eachother, taking all of the key factors of each theory and accepting one answer within them all, boiling it down to the conclusion that it was my very essence that caused the to do as they did, I as one and I being who I am.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub74.ezboard.com/uazzepthx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azzepth X</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://facelink.com/azzepth BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#993300>(2/19/01 6:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=159.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> -the second scroll-</span><hr size=1> Dear Hipp<br>
<br>
          When the sun rose the next morning they were still there I packed up and decided to take the mare along with me and lead out from the Forrest to safety. The wolves watched me as I had broke camp and packed up to continue my journey.  Then when I looked back upon them before making my way off along my chosen path they looked at me as if they were awaiting something, a command perhaps or gesture of guidance. Then as I began to leave they would follow and soon they began to lead me. They led me out of the Forrest along a trail that would lead the mare and I to a small town. Yet they refused to cross the border of where the forrest met the path that would lead to civilization. They waited at first watching over me as if I were one of there own ensuring that no danger would present itself, when I looked back a second time to see if my new found friends were still watching they, they had all disappeared. Fled back within the forrest and left the mare and I to enter the small town set just one hundred and twenty yards away from the forrest.  <br>
<br>
 The town however was a very different and odd  experience. One where I would learn more then I had asked for, something that I wish I could unlearn now.   I brought the mare to a stable within the small town where the man that owned it was more then happy to take it in the lovely creature. He refused any source of payment I had offered  and would only ask of how long I was to stay.  When I told him that I was not staying at all  and was only  passing through and that the mare was his to keep. He began to insist I stay longer practically begging even. The man was however  grateful for my gift and after the mare had been settled in he would bring me to meet his fellow villagers  as we roamed through the town the more I noticed something odd, every soul in that town was grateful for my being there and all asked me how long I was to stay. I received praising and blessings, I was offered free supplies and shelter. It took some time before I would ask why they were all treating me this way, but non-would answer. I grew angry with them and for not answering me and only offering me more, insisting I remain there for loner period of time. I grew silent with them and attempted to leave, back along my path in search of the answer's to my questions,  only to have half the town beg I stay. I demanded to know why, and would be taken to a board of elder advisors that ran the town, there answer to my question held a request within it, and what I still consider a uneducated assumption due to just how desperate the people of this town were.  They had claimed that a wickedness had plagued there town. A wickedness in the form of undead child that grew within its death instead of decaying,  There legend was that it was the child of the founding father of there town, the child had been a victim to a plague they had claimed and his skin grew pale,  his nails had grown to the claws of a bears and that his eye's had flooded to become a full blood red color. They had claimed he would rise from an old crypt and set out to raise terror upon the town. They would once again praise me, I met there praise with a naive series of protests. They had seemed to believe that I was sent to them bye the gods. When I answered with no and told them whom I was, where I was from, and the true nature of my quest, they would only use each fact as new way's to claim me as there savior.  I had suddenly felt obligated am not to disappoint the innocent and I granted there request, volunteering my help to rid there town of what they called Anarchy. For two day's I stayed at the town Inn but nothing happened I began to question their claims of this undead child until the third night. Then one night while resting in the room I was given a horrible cry ran out through the Inn. I rushed to  see what had  happened but the time I reached the source of the cry I was to late and had found what was left of the owner of the Inn's wife, the mear sight of the mess left behind was enough to make one with a light stomach vomit. The only thing of her that remained in one peace was her torso, blood stained the walls, entrails were ether torn out of her body or missing, her legs, feet, arms, hands, and head ether missing or in bloody peace's. I visited the crypt where the child was said to have been haunting but I found nothing, not even a sense of evil. I had asked where the child's remains were and found myself at the receiving end of blank and traumatized faces. For reasons that they dared not speak of, due to personal and mental well-being.  The child's remains were supposed to of been within the crypt that I had searched yet not even a coffin was within it. I had asked where the child's remains were, not one person elder or youth could explain where the child's remains were. This only raised more unanswered questions, as well as frustration. The locals were so clueless as to what was haunting them that it left I as clueless as them. <br>

I am truly sorry about my absents and the long strech of time between the last scroll and this one, all will be explained in this scroll. I will also be returning to Themiscrya very soone for my travels have been cut short, Here is why.<br>
<br>
The next morning I would awake to something I was not at all prepared for. The town had turned into an angry mob. All claiming that I was not the savior they had prayed for but a servant of evil. While I was resting a man had arrived late during the night claiming to be a hunter. One whom has been following and studying such disturbances throughout the lands, he claimed to be a druid of some sort a problem solver specializing in this type of situation. With that he had convinced the entire town that I was not there savior at all but a servent of evil and that I was of a higher grade then this undead child. That it was my Acolyte. He was calm and persuasive; he convinced the people in such a short amount of time that was indeed the answer to their problem He has promised to rid them of there curse. When I was comforted bye him after being dragged from out of my bed I had sensed something unlike anything I had before. There was more to him then what he was presenting to the people, something disturbing almost divine. I had almost fallen into his web, as did the people of the town. He would twist the words of my arguments around and answer questions with such convincing and logical answers, I almost believed him for the answers he gave could very well be the answer I had been searching for about myself. The things he said held so much appeal were so intrusting and well thought out so it seemed. The only thing that kept me from believing him as the others did was a sense that I have discovered a window in which I can deteckted certain things, notions without names but only feelings. I had tried to escape but was forced back, captured I would of fought my way out but it would of only made this man called Dreyghem seem more right in what he had preached to the people about whom he had obtained such a powerful hold upon. I had dare not harm any of them because I saw them as innocent and only following what they found to be logic that had been fed to them bye Dreyghem. It was there own right to act the way that they did if it was wrong or not, bye not harming them I thought I could help them aid them to see that I was not what he had made me out to be. Other then that I felt sorry for them, they were only trying to do what they thought were best for them, who was I to tell them they were wrong. So I was taken prisoner and thrown into a cell to await trial. I was left within the cell for seven day’s, living on bread and water, the mob would return to shout and throw things at the window of my cell. I had noticed something though the mobs were growing small, the usual commotion that I could hear from inside the cell grew smaller and smaller and soon there was no mob at all. No bread or water would be brought to me and no guard was there to watch over me. Trapped in a cell in what seemed to be an empty town, from what I could see outside it was a ghost town those whom occupied it had vanished. Sitting there in my cell one silent and cold night, starving and tired I would recall what I had done in our war against the Centaurs. I thought about what I had done those unexplained coincidences where it had seemed that I had possessed more power then I thought. For hours I had tried to figure out how I had done what I did then but would find nothing in me. So silly was I to begin to think that it had been my Kama’s and not I perhaps it was just a coincidence I thought. Then it had come to me; it crept up on me from out of nowhere like a random memory or acknowledgement. Like the power it had found me in my cell and whispered into my ear what, and how.  To my feet I rose and looked to the wall holding me within then like a stampeding beast I charged toward it, throwing my fists out at the wall just as I approached it.  A glimmer of dark blue surrounded where I had struck the wall so quickly before I would demolish it. Running straight out of my cell back into the town and just as I had viewed from inside my cell, the town was empty. Now one question one might ask is why had I not just done what I had just did in running through the wall day’s earlier? I have two reasons one I did not believe I could my attempting or even thinking about it was more of a wish I had, I had not a clue I of all people possessed this power. Second this man Dreyghem had convinced the entire town that I was something of a greater evil, crashing through a wall to escape the cell they put me in would only make things worse. Any way I would wonder about the town for an hour in search of my belongings figuring that the others had left for some reason and would return at any time. An hour went bye and I would find nothing, feeling defeated and stranded I would head toward the forest trusting my path finding skills that I would make it home. Just as I would reach the boarder of where the town met the wilderness from behind me the entire town would erupt it flames. I would turn round to become face to face with the man named Dreyghem. I would look to him straight into his eerie eye’s as the town would begin to crumble and from behind him walked the citizens of the town only they had no possessed there more mortal nature and in many ways appeared to be damned. As I have seen in paintings of those whom are they looked only more exaggerated. I have not a clue what happened a moment later, I do barely recall the howling of wolves and the damned charging past Dreyghem on toward me. I had blacked out, lost concouisness and when I awoke I found myself back in the wild surrounded bye the wolves that befriended me. My belongings lay next to me the injured mare waited for me, it had almost seemed like the entire incident with the town had never happened. There was however a explanation as to how I had got to where I was, why I had my belongings, why I was surrounded bye the wolves and the mare waiting. A scroll lay upon the earth just to left of me, a scroll from my brother. The scroll and its contents are something that will be explained later because for now all I want to do is get home.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0
