~Dear Athelfi,<br>
       I know its been a really long time since you have last heard from me and I know that it was a short notice for me to have left.  Granted I know that what I did was wrong, and I'm not talking to all of you, just a certain individual(you know who you are), but I am very sorry for doing such a dasterdly thing.  The rest of you probably already know of this thing.  Most of you probably hate my guts and ok I made a mistake.  I will tell you it won't happen again.  I've been away long enough to what I guess you could say is grow up.  I am once again ready to serve to all of you and protect you with my own life.  I send my condolences to Tasha and I hope she can forgive me.  I was being stupid and if you'd never want to speak to me again I understand.  Furthermore, I have missed all of you greatly.  You guys stood up for me when I needed it most and for those of you in the high council that were friends of mine, you did pass judgement upon me fairly.  I am looking forward to getting things back to how they were if at all possible.  Or I'd like to at least come close to this.  It will take time to do it, but it can be done.  If any of you'd like to speak to  me about anything, anything at all please either leave me a note or come talk to me personally and I will be glad to talk to you about whatever it is. <br>
Herete. <br>
