The night sky was crystal clear with brilliant stars glinting quietly above. The smell of flowers and forest filled the air as a light breeze blew about causing the flames of the fire to dance.<br>
<br>
Delilah was dawned in a rough brown skirt stitched with pieces of fur and bone-beads along with colored straw around the hems of her skirt. Her top was leathery and dark, also covered like her skirt and upon her head and face she wore her traditional amazon mask that she had made herself.<br>
<br>
She had a few young amazons sitting around the bonfire with drums and instruments they had made themselves. She had taught them some amazon ritualistic dance music that she planned to use this night.<br>
<br>
She nodded to them through her mask and they began playing the music as she rhythmically began to stomp, spin and dance her way around the bonfire, swooping down once every time around to pick up a log or two and throw them into the fire as she danced.<br>
<br>
As the few amazons continued with their music she kept her dance going, stringing in Amazon singing. The song she sang was in the tongue of the ancient Amazons.. This song was asking for guidance from the ancient amazons who are long gone from the tribe physically.  She had felt a darkness spawning it's way through the nation and it left her feeling uneasy. This night, she would sing the song to ask for protection, clear-mindedness, and compassion as well as guidance. Her steps began pounding harder; her hands clapped loudly as she spun, leapt, stomped, wove and put her heart and soul into her dance.<br>
<br>
She was still feeding the fire every time around, but her mind was fully concentrated while the young amazons still played the music. She would dance as long as she needed.. even into the day.. She will keep dancing and those few amazons will keep playing... until she received a sign from the spirits of the physically departed amazons that help.. would come. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 432<br> <font color=#993300>(8/17/01 5:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=268.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> a bonfire in the night</span><hr size=1> The journey away from the village of Themiscrya had been a long one, but needed.   Hipp had been away with Gabrielle and Theseus to visit Potedaia.  It was relaxing in a strange way....yet unsettleing.  In a world, where men made the decisions...with the unknown help of women.  She had left her love and child back in Potedaia.  Gabrielle's mother was not feeling well, and she wanted to stay and take care of her.  Hipp understood, but she knew she needed to get back to Themiscrya before they all thought she had rode off the face of the earth.<br>
The night was still as Hippolyte rode towards the city of amazons.  The stars barely lighting her trail.  Then she sensed something and lifted her brown eyes to the horizon.  There she could see a warm glow from where Themiscrya should sit.  Concern furrowed her brows, and she quickly urged her mare to race towards the city.  A million things went thru her mind as branches scratched her arms..as she sent the mare thru a short cut off the road.  Dodging around trees and over bushes, her brown eyes seeking the source.  Then she heard it.....the sound of joyous voices singing...the voices of women.  Hipp pulled the mare to a halt and stopped.  She could see them thru the trees and a smile rose to her lips.  Their voices were beautiful and proud.  <br>
&quot;Praise Hera,&quot; she whispered.  As her eyes watched she could see Delilah leading them on, dancing away.   Her smile beamed, her eyes slightly wrinkling with it.  &quot;Bless the amazons....they are even stronger then me.&quot; She laughed softly.  For the longest time, she just sat there watching them.  It was a wonderful sight to see. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sartha>Sartha</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 157<br> <font color=#993300>(8/17/01 10:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=268.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: a bonfire in the night</span><hr size=1> ::Sartha appeared on a hill above the dancers and fire, looking down upon the scene with those emotionless silvery-golden eyes.

<br>
* DeL got up and walked out to her mare, she mounted her and allowed her nightvision to direct her to the Queen, she rode quietly through the woods. Hearing Hippolytes words as she rode up behind her, a smile on her lips, she knew Hippolyte hadnt known she was there, as she evened out her mare with the Queens, she softly smiled at her and spoke.* None are stronger then yourself my Queen, especially with having to deal with turmoil that sometimes falls upon this village.<br>
*She turned her head and watched the younger Amazons with Deliliah * Wow, it seems like ages. I feel old.. * she laughed quietly as to not disturb the others around.*<br>

He knew that because he was male, he would not be able to participate in the dancing. That was fine with him, he was able to attend some of the festivals in Scynthia, and even Orio-Pata at times.<br>

The night would lighten soon and the music she felt would stop soon, the amazons playing weren't well practiced for playing music for too long.<br>
<br>
She was beginning to run low on her wood for the bonfire, but that didn't lower her spirit for the dance and song of the amazons.  With all the spinning one would most usually get very tired and very dizzy, but she, on the other hand, was wide awake and full of energy.  Anyone who would listen and watch would hear and feel the tranceful music and dance, and might realize that music and dance was a great power far beyond anything else in the physical world and should most certainly be a most welcome gift to the tribe.. as a way to come together.<br>

<br>
The music stopped abruptly as the younger amazons rushed over to see what the matter was, but she groaned and told them to leave to their huts at once with a wince.  She pulled herself to her feet, her mind with a new thought as she read the scroll that was attached to the tree by the spear. Her eyes closed and she walked away from it, to her hut to prepare in help to Alysia.. the bonfire would extinguish itself within the hour and she would be off to Scynthia to help a fellow amazon.<br>
<br>
As she headed to the hut, she saw the amazons still there and kindly asked them to play a couple rounds of awakening music to welcome the dawn and thena few rounds of music for the awareness within the amazons to arise as well, and then she headed into her hut and closed the door as those few amazons headed back to the bonfire to play again after giving a glance to the scroll on the tree. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Wulf Heracles Darkshade Loire</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(8/17/01 12:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=268.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> A Night . . .</span><hr size=1> Wulf stood instantly when he caught sight of Delilah as well as the scroll. <br>
