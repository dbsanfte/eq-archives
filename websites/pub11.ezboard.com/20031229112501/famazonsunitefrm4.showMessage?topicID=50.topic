The loud snap of the twig almost echoed through the air.

There was a small fire near where she had spent her nights, and her things were piled somewhere where they could not be seen. Now, she saw two women and a man enter the valley.<br>
Quietly, without any sound, the amazon assassin crept over to them, watching carefully. She could not see any of them properly, which annoyed the amazon beyond reason.<br>
She suddenly leapt out into their path, sword drawn and in a defensive position.<br>
<br>
“Welcome to the Crimson Valley.” She paused for a moment, “My name is Kalasin Ti’Ya-Kuk’Tai. Can I be of any service to y’all?”<br>

He had already set up a small shop area and secured some tools that he'd found in one of the storage huts around the village.  He was able to move around without too much grief or worry for the time being and he was content to simply be doing something with his hands that enabled him to keep his mind on other things.  <br>
<br>
While it was cooler to work without his shirt on, the sun bore down on his bare skin, leaving it a slight reddened color.  He paid it no mind and continued to work, moving to install the reinforcements to the hut and ensure that not only was it stable but it was also flexible lest a strong wind come through.  He had noticed Kalasin when she had approached Lalita and Celaneo, but he had been too distracted by his work to interfere and he was also keen enough to know that it was not his place to greet visitors to the village. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=battlingangel>Battling Angel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#993300>(6/5/03 6:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=50.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.speedis.org/images/214.png WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Coming Home</span><hr size=1> Kalasin peered at the man, not recognising him for quite a time. She quickly turned back to the two women before her though. Her long blonde hair flew around her wildly as she did so.<br>
<br>
&quot;Excellent!&quot; she said rather happily. &quot;I have been waiting here for a weeks now, hoping that someone would be true to that scroll given to me by the feline.&quot; She indicated over her shoulder to the panther that she knew was hidden somewhere.<br>
<br>
She quickly sheathed her sword, figuring that she would not be attacked, and even if she was, she would be fine as she was without a weapon. <br>
<br>
&quot;I am sorry about my rudeness before. My name is Kalasin Ti'Ya-Kuk'Tai, Head Ambassador of Themisycra, Personal Advisor to Queen Sumeria Leona, and Head Seductress of Karpu Kale.&quot; she smiled sweetly at the two. &quot;Is there anything I can do to help around here?

Most of the structural repairs were done now, he just needed to re-thatch the roof and then everything should be as good as new.  He entered the hut and made a bee-line to set up the cot that had long been forgotten against one of the walls. &quot;Celaneo, let me help you with the cot so you can have somewhere to lie down.&quot;  He smiled at Kalasin nodding politely, then moved to remove the old linens from the cot.  He tossed them outside as carefully as he could, then he checked the cot to be certain it would stand up under his weight.  Convinced that the structural integrity was still intact, he moved to take her bedding and make the bed for her to rest on.  &quot;I hope I am not interrupting anything I wanted to come inside for a bit and take a breather.&quot;  He settled down next to Celaneo's feet on the ground and glanced at Lalita, &quot;Would you mind if I had some of the tea?

I'd be happy to fetch the water.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lalitasilver>Lalita Silver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#993300>(6/5/03 10:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=50.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/lita1617/lita.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Introductions</span><hr size=1> Lalita nods at the boy, &quot;You are more then welcome to come in and rest. There is a water bucket in my old hut, the one with the dead garden in front of it. Skada will show you the way,&quot; she nudges the panther with her foot, &quot;hey lazy bones, show him where we live.&quot; The panther gives Lalita a look but gets up none the less and trots off to show Theseus where a water bucket might be. She slowly lurches to her feet, &quot;Oh I feel old,&quot; she sighs a bit and pulls her pack along with her and looks for a place to set it down. Finding a good spot she pulls out one medium dark green bag out of her pack and then sets the green bag in front of her. Opening the bag she pulls out yet another bag, very small and smelling of earth. She looks over at the women, &quot;Mint tea for the mother to be, and something pleasant for the rest of us, yes? After tea perhaps Kalasin and I shall go over the village, she'd know what is here more then I, I didn't take the time to look around when I woke up.&quot; Lalita absently rubs the back of her head and then her shoulder looking distant for a moment, then plasters on a smile and sets about making ready for tea. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=battlingangel>Battling Angel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 118<br> <font color=#993300>(6/6/03 1:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=50.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.speedis.org/images/214.png WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Introductions</span><hr size=1> Kalasin smiled widely at Theseus. It had been some time since she had seen him, she did not think that she would see him again in a hurry, but sure enough there he was, and Hippolyte's son no less. This had not ever been revealed to her. With a polite shake of the head, she turned down the tea, having never been one for the substance. She was an ale and mead girl herself.<br>
&quot;The village is not in too bad a shape.&quot; She explained rather quickly, once again covering for her poor Greek. &quot;Nothing that a good group of people couldn't fix. It must be the work of the gods that it is in such relatively decent condition.&quot;<br>
The amazon ran a hand over her firm stomach as it growled rather quietly. She frowned. It was not often that this happened. She rarely got hungry.<br>
&quot;So, what are your plans here?&quot;<br>

The water was barely cool.  Thankfully it had sat in the shade for a time.  His eyes moved to the sky and he was immediatly grateful that Zeus had chosen to keep the day dry.  He smiled a slightly crooked smile as he settled down inside the hut on the floor thinking he'd only relax for a few moments, then head back to work some more on Celaneo's hut.  He wanted to get her hut completely restored before moving to any other since she was with child.  <br>
<br>
Leaning his head back against the side of the hut, he relaxed a bit faster than he'd intended and soon found himself sound asleep. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lalitasilver>Lalita Silver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#993300>(6/6/03 2:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=50.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/lita1617/lita.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Introductions</span><hr size=1> She looks over from her spot, and chuckles at the boy, sleeping on the ground then turns her attentions back to the woman hearing the growling sound, and pulls out a paper wrapped package.

<br>
She turns towards Kalasin, &quot;So how long do you plan to stay here?&quot; She pushes her hair back and sighs, &quot;You can stay for as long as you like... so long as you dont mind the mess.&quot;  She smiles and then sips some more tea.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=battlingangel>Battling Angel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 120<br> <font color=#993300>(6/6/03 9:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=50.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.speedis.org/images/214.png WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Introductions</span><hr size=1> Kalasin smiles. She was glad to finally have someone to talk with. Things had been awfully quiet in the Crimson Valley with only a feline to speak with. She was exceedingly happy about the whole thing. She nodded her thanks as she took some bread and quickly devoured it.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have no where to be now that I think of it. I can stay for quite some time. Perhaps I will occasionally make the trip to Themisycra or Hyrcania, perhaps go and see my husband. Other than that, I am pretty free.&quot; She smiled.<br>
<br>
The young amazon woman pushed her blonde hair out of her face and thought for a moment, trying to sort everything out in her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;As for building, I am not the best, but I certainly could help.&quot;<br>

She feels her stomach, only suppose to be a month or so along, but it feels like its three or more.
