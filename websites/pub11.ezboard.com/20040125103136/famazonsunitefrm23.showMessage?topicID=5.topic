He smiled in pride as he saw his new home before him.  Somehow the Fates had allowed Serena to be back in his life.  And it was an incredible feeling to have her as his wife again.  He turned the wagon to the barn behind the house.  <br>

Then jumped out of the seat and swaggered back to the cow, "Come on girl".  He urged the cow to follow him, as he pulled the lead rope.  He hoped that Serena would be happy with the one he found in the village.  He was not one with an eye for milk cows.  But, he figured this one looked good.  A large strong hand pushed the door open, and he lead the cow inside. He led her to a large warm stall and then closed the door behind her.  Grabbing a pitchfork from the wall, he began to throw hay into a bin for the cow.  She slowely moved over and began to munch on the sweat hay.  After replacing the pitchfork to the wall, he turned and walked out of the barn.  Shutting the door behind him. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uherculestlj.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hercules TLJ</A> at: 2/12/01 2:28:00 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> MhAphrodite</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FFFF33>(2/12/01 10:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Taking a peek into her bro's life</span><hr size=1> Seeing Hercules with a bounce to his step signified that something's up.
