It would be a difficult task to fix. THat was if and once Dawn came back. But she still was unconcious. It was a difficult thing to see for anyone. Dawn had always been the one to pull people in and out of the healing state. Most everyone, including Aly and Hipp had seen her in action upon healing others and herself's wounds.

 Dawn jerked abit, her mouth opened as if she were to scream, but she didn't scream. Although her breath did soften and slow. <br>

 Dawn's body convulsed again, as all of her wounds reopened, and began to bleed violently, just as if they were fresh. No matter what Aly put on in the beginning, her inner body was pulling them back open. <br>

She stopped only to slit the throat of the horse, letting the blood drain away into a large bowl. She chanted as she did this, and then drank the blood as she knew was done. Then she began to dance again. She danced until the night passed away and only then did the power of death take hold and rip her soul away from her body- taking it to the depths of hell so that she might help Dawn::<br>
