&quot;So, you have grown tired of the Amazons then?  What may I ask brought this on?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, so you wish to know about my travels.  Hmmm...well lets see.  Well for one to truley appreciate death, one must see Life in all its 'glory' or 'unglory'.  It is pitiful the way these mortals treat eachother.  For one reason or another, they find a difference, they use that as an excuse to fight.  To war.  Life is far worse a fate than any I can give here in Tartarus.  Some of the blame the gods for their misfortunes.  While yes we do have a hand in it sometimes, they cease to see the true cause for most of their misfortune.  Their fellow man.  In Death there is no blame...Death simply 'is'.  They can choose not to accept Life, but Death is always an inevitability.&quot;<br>
