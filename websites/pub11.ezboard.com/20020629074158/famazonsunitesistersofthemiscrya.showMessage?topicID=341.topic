<br>
Artemis... Eris... how fortunate that we should meet near these sacred grounds. I was just thinking of the rich history that the Amazon Nation shares among its many tribes, and if I might modestly say, I am sure much of that might be due to both of you. Your respective wisdom and duty to the sisterhood deserves its credit's due. In respect of the Amazon way of life I find myself in these lands looking to a family birthright I have been too employed to give consideration. Quite an oversight on my part to deny myself the experience of exploring my true belonging. You do know of my mother I assume? Gabrielle? She is a Queen of the Amazon lands. I suppose in all humbleness that does make me an Amazon princess. What better way to honor the family from which I come from than to pay respects to the most noble and brave of warriors in the Amazon Burial Grounds. I am sure the two of you can understand the respect I pay in that.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugabbyshope.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GabbysHOPE</A> at: 2/12/02 10:35:56 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugoddessartemis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goddess Artemis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 309<br> <font color=#993300>(2/13/02 12:45:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=341.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/mogoddessartemis/images/triplemoon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Up To No Good</span><hr size=1> ~Artemis listened to the girls words and smirked, arse kissing neve rworked on this Goddess, she was quite different from the other Olympians who reveled in the idea of others kissing there bottoms, and Artemis was not fooled, not the least at the girls pretend act of innocence.

Perhaps... there are relics left behind in memory of them. Something to give encouragement to those still living to give good wishes to their fallen sisters. Charms... or runes perhaps.
