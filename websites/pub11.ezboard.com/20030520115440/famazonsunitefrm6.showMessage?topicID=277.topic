For some reason, she enjoyed being reminded of what she had done in the past. It helped her overcome her inner demons as she called them. Few amazons had taken themselves into the hut without good reason. Yakut came and went after her first kill. Xenira went in before her coronation. But this time . . .  it was different.<br>
<br>
The large white wolf entered in without a word to anyone else. As the door shut behind him, the large wolf transformed into Alysia's twenty year old son, Wulf.<br>
<br>
He said a few small chants and lit a fire in the center of the pit before he went into meditation. He needed to go through the ritual, and soon more would come to assist him. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">~*~ Jessica ~*~<br>

<br>
&quot;Wulf, your Materas does not know of this does she?&quot;<br>
<br>
Wulf shook his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;No one does.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sariah sighed lightly. <br>
<br>
&quot;I will help you only because you look like you need this. But I believe that Vasilissa would have wanted to be here. You don't know how bad this could be Wulf.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wulf looked straight into the fire.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't care. I need this.&quot; <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">~*~ Jessica ~*~<br>

She spoke ancient words taught to her by Alysia. The room was empty except for she and Wulf, and as he closed his eyes and reopened them . . . she was gone and he was in the entry way of the village.<br>
<br>
&quot;What the . . .&quot; He glanced around. Only things looked different. He then looked to a figure standing in front of him. Someone he killed most likely. Everytime Aly went into a ritual she saw one of her prey in them. He would simply shrug it off, no one he killed meant anything to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Murderer.&quot; A young boy glared. <br>
<br>
Wulf caught his breath and reached for air as he saw his own victim. Wolf.<br>
Wulf's first kill . . . was himself. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">~*~ Jessica ~*~<br>

Flashes of murders, of bloodshed was flown in front of him, and then as the images stopped. He looked out and could see the entire amazon nation looking towards a large flaming pile of wood. <br>
However as he looked closer, he could see that it was not wood burning, but thousands of bodies. Women who had been murdered.<br>
<br>
He saw his Mother standing forward speaking.<br>
<br>
&quot;Safe passage to our non amazon sisters, who have lost their lives.&quot;<br>
<br>
He then opened his eyes and sat up quickly breathing heavily.<br>
He looked around and saw a woman dressed in gold sitting near him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Greeting Wulf.&quot; She smiled. She carried across her back a large bow and arrow, as well as a sword and numerous other weapons.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you?&quot; He blinked as he could see no amazon markings.<br>
<br>
She stood.<br>
&quot;My name is Nemesis.&quot;<br>
<br>
He knew her then.<br>
&quot;What are you doing on amazon lands?&quot;<br>
<br>
She merely laughed sweetly. &quot;I could ask you the same thing. You're in human form, and as far as I have heard, it's not legal for you to be here.&quot;<br>
<br>
He looked down a bit.<br>
&quot;I needed to search my soul.&quot;<br>
<br>
She nodded a bit.<br>
&quot;I know, I saw.&quot;<br>
<br>
He looked up.<br>
&quot;You did?&quot;<br>
<br>
She nodded.<br>
&quot;You know, many of the Olympian Gods will never admit it, but there are those of us who feel as your Mother does. There are a few amazons who are equal to us.&quot; She smiled. &quot;Your Mother as a child was blessed by Artemis and Athena. Your sister Cora was blessed by the Fates, Aliya by Artemis, Isabella by Athena and Ares. . .&quot;<br>
She looked to him.<br>
&quot;Did you ever wonder when it would be your turn?&quot;<br>
<br>
He quirked a brow.<br>
&quot;I dont understand.&quot;<br>
<br>
She sighed.<br>
&quot;Many wars continue to break out on Olympus and I am forced to remain there to assist in my own ways. I have chosen you Wulf. You once fought for Justice in Athens among your friends Nick and Kaeira. I am asking to do so again.&quot;<br>
<br>
He blinked a few times looking down at the red tattoo on his wrist that read &quot;Justice&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;You want to be apart of the amazon nation even when you cant be on amazon lands? Then fight for the women who dont know how to be amazons. There are so many acts of violence occuring even in Athens where you live Wulf. Serve the people, they are yours to serve.&quot;<br>
<br>
He remembered the vision of burning bodies.<br>
&quot;I serve no God.&quot; <br>
<br>
She nodded.<br>
&quot;I do not ask you to serve me. You are my chosen Wulf, an equal. Serve the people, and save them.&quot; She then placed her hand on his forehead and a rush flew threw him.<br>
&quot;I am giving you my blessing if swiftness. Travel through the night, quickly, prey on those who must be punished, and save those who shall one day rejoice in your chosen name. But keep secret of your acts as well as you can. For there will be those who shall seek your life.&quot;<br>
<br>
He realized then what he must do.<br>
He nodded to Nemesis and she then vanished.<br>
<br>
Before the fire was out that night, Wulf was gone. He fled to Athens to seek out the blood that would make him begin his destiny. The blood of the prey. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">~*~ Jessica ~*~<br>
