She knew she was Zeus' most precious daughter. It had been declared before her birth that she would be. But she did not like to brag or speak of such. She felt it was her duty to keep peace upon Olympus and if she herself was low in humility, hate would rage war upon the Gods.<br>
<br>
She then thought of Athens, her beautiful Athens and smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;After Poseidon and I had our little fight over the land, Posiedon gave the people a water well comming from the sea.&quot; She rolled her eyes at the thought. &quot;Apparently the well overflowed after I won the fight, and the salt water flooded the streets and ate away at much of the marble stone and buildings.&quot;<br>

Hera had a certain jealousy for Athena.  She knew that Athena's powers equaled Zeus. And that she stood next in line to the throne of Mt. Olympus.  A throne that Hera had her eye on.

She smiled and nodded to Aphrodite about the temple.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes sister, far on the outskirts a temple is being constructed.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then smiled seeing Hera. She lowered her head lightly in great honor of her step-mother. For even though Hera was not her biological mother, Athena held her in the highest respect a daughter could give.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hera, it is an honor to have you come and great me here.&quot; She smiled softly.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have heard that you have given birth to a new Goddess?&quot;<br>
<br>
Before Athena could be answered, her father had appeared. She smiled brightly in his pressence and ran to his side smiling as he kissed her cheek. She knew she was Zeus' most favoured, and she loved it. But she was noble and never let her greed for her father's love carry her away. She bowed her head lightly to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Father, it is wonderful to see you, I am indeed jhonored to have a feast thrown in my honor. Soon Athens shall ride a temple to honor my Father, the King of the Gods!&quot; She smiled lightly holding her head high. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uxgoddessaphrodite.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xGoddess Aphrodite</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(7/10/01 2:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=109.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.xenafan.com/gallery/official/aphrodite_02.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Celebration</span><hr size=1> ::Aphrodite, who was so happily talking to Apollo, sees he's swarmed by the Muses.
