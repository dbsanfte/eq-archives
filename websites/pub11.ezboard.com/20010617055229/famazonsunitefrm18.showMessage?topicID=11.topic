::Out of sheer insanity, or maybe desperation?, she wanders up to the board and puts her scroll on it, securing it to the board with a small dagger she ripped off some poor male last week. She then turns and saunters back to her village, shaking her head in amusement of herself for actually putting up a post she knows no one will respond to.::<br>

I am 18 winters old and the Princess of my tribe.  I'm willing to try almost anything twice, but only with the right person.  I'm looking for a serious relationship with someone who is emotionally stable and wouldn't mind taking an active part in my tribe.  If interested, I can be found either in the SoT village or the ASoNG village.<br>

~Hello Varia,<br>
My name is Lily, at the moment I am not currently belonging to any amazon tribe. I was born to one of course, but the entire tribe besides myself were killed by Roman legions. I am always up for fun, a fight or two. And at the moment I despise men. If you wish to talk with me, please reply.~<br>

Am I seen as so strong that I can't love?.,She looks down to the ground and then out the door,just doing what she normaly does when not helping people,wathing the amazons walk by,in their happy world,the she is excluded from so.but wishes to be so much of.:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Sariah Scynthian Shamaness</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(5/13/01 1:55:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Roaming through the village. . .</span><hr size=1> The Scynthian Shamaness had just posted one of her personals on the board. She actually had been meaning to for a while but had never had the chance. She usually stayed in Scynthia most of the time but because of the ritual hunt comming up, she thought she might get out of the lands and explore things in Themiscrya. <br>
<br>
She was wandering by the rumage of scampering amazons trying to get a word in edgewise. ..failing obviously though. She then saw a dark haired woman walk into a hut. Sariah, walked up to the hut and knocked lightly on the slightly open door.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yasoo?&quot; She looked in slightly brushing a piece of hair out of her face.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry to just barge in like this, but I was just wandering through the village and I'm a bit lost.
