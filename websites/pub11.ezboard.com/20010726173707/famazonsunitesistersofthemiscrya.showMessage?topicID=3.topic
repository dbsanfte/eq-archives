With that Sethra took off to the town rushing to get things all ready so she doesn't keep her Queen waiting. She ran into her hut and packed up some clothes, any weapons she may need, some food and a water bottle. She ran to the well, filled the water bottle to the brim and set off to her horse.<br>
She went into the barn and attended to her horse she called Two Flasher Thacher.... Two Flash for short. Two Flash was a big black horse with an odd color pattern near the hoofs. The hair above the left hoof of the front legs was white and the right one was black, the hair above the right hoof in the rear was white and the left was black. Hence how he got his name. When he ran, it reminded Sethra of two fires flickering into the night that was set upon the sea shore to warn fishers of rocks. One of her memories before she joined into the tribe.<br>
&quot;Two Flash, ready to go out?&quot; The horse shook it's head and seemed eager to venture out. Sethra brushed him out and saddled him and headed to the river to let him drink.<br>
After Two Flash was done, they set out to Hera's temple and ready for anything that may happen on the road ahead.<br>
