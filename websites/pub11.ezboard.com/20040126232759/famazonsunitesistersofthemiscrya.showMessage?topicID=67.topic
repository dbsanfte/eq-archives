::A loud wolf cry was heard in the distance. Amazons throughout Themiscrya were doing their regular duties. Most were in the camp training, while the others were sitting around relaxing for once. The wolf cry echoed in the lands and all the amazons turned with smiles knowing that Alysia had returned. Out of the forest came close to 30 white wolves running towards the village. Many of them stopped to see on the amazons and lick their faces. The others stopped and created a pathway for the black stallion that came through them in good speed. Alysia dismounted Majestic and smiled to the amazons stopping to give a few of them hugs and Yasoos. She seemed much better and verywell healed from the painful childbirth weeks before. However, she did not carry with her the man child Wulf. She took the reins of her horse and head him towards the Queen's hut, stopping to refill her lambskin at the stream that was closeby. She smiled looking to Hippolyte and saluted her in respect.:: Vassalissa, I have returned from Scynthia. ::She smiled and ran up giving Hippolyte a hug and laughter of joy.:: <p>"Hey Roman, have you ever witnessed an amazon exectution?

None of the amazons saw him. He smiled at that thought. For he had not seen any of them in weeks. &quot;They won't reconize me&quot; He thought. The Atmah's blessing of immortality to the child had made him grow faster than mortals as if he were an Olympian of some sort. All of Alysia's children grew with such speed for their immortal blessings, Hopefully the amazons would understand such. He knew that one day after he began training, his mother would cease his growth of immortalness and let him age as a boy. As his mother went towards Hippolyte and hugged her, the tiny boy in the appearance of a four year old, jumped off of the horse and proceeded to sneak away from the crowd. He did not remember any of them and he did not want to interupt his mother's &quot;Glory&quot; at the moment. He felt odd in Themiscrya, for when in Scynthia. . he had his older brother Xavier to play with and sometimes Cora would bring Julian up from Rome to play with him. He was not used to a village without ANY males. As he began to sneak away he felt the animal skins falling from his back.:: Uh oh ::He said softly as one of the Large White wolves tugged on them trying to bring the boy back towards Alysia.:: Go away Solan! ::The wolf was so &quot;properly&quot; named.:: Leave me be. ::He pushed at the wolf that was nearly twice his size. He failed miserably at trying to get away. But the tugging of the skins lead Wulf to pounce Solan and they began to wrestle in the mud after a rainfall. The two of them rolled around passing many amazons and Solan ended up pinning Wulf down about 5 feet in between each Hippolyte and Aly. The wolf smirked and leaped off of the boy and ran off towards the river to clean himself. Alysia looked down at Wulf with her hands on her hips. Amazons began to mumble in teh background asking themselves and eachother if this truly was the man child they saw nearly four weeks ago. Some believed it for they had seen immortal children grow so fast. He looked up at Aly with that same innocent grin that Iolaus always pulls, Aly was not going to fall for it.<br>
&lt;Aly&gt; Wulf Heracles Kinneas. Must you always get a mess when we travel? The Shamaness bathed you just this morning and look at you now. ::She narrowed her eyes at the child with her hands on her hips::<br>
I'm sorry momma. But Thw wolves started it. ::He smirked playfully::<br>
&lt;Aly&gt; ::Sighs:: Verywell now stand up and give respect to your Queen Wulf. <br>
::He stood and wiped some of the mud off of his arms, his messy blonde hair a bit dirty as he bowed his head before Hippolyte and then raised it with a childish innocent smile:: I am sorry for causing a mess within your village Vassawissa.<br>
&lt;Aly&gt; ::Whispered:: Vassalissa.<br>
Vassalissa. ::He corrected himself blushing a bit for he didn't understand the Themiscyran language verywell though it did not differ much from Scynthian. He could hear a bunch of the little amazon girls giggling in the background, he grinned as he turned around and flashed them a dashing smile::<br>
&lt;Aly&gt; Don't even think about it little man ::She chuckled:: I won't have my son dating at four years old. ::She laughed::<br>
::He smiled to his mother and then went up towards the Queen and smiled hearing such wonderful stories of her kindness and friendship to his mother. He opened his arms and wrapped them about her giving her a hug. . a muddy one but a hug all in all.:: I couldn't wait to meet you Hippolyte. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://hometown.aol.com/queenhippolyte/spinningsword.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Vasilissa</span><br>  Posts: 129<br> <font color=#993300>(10/28/00 12:05 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://facelink.com/Hippolyte?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wulf's Return from Scynthia</span><hr size=1> :::Hipp chuckled and kneeled down to give him a hug::: Yasoo big prince.  :::Hipp smiled looking him over.::: You have grown big and strong..haven't you.  ::she grinned::: show me one of those muscles, Wulf!

Once she flipped out of the sky she rolled gently across the ground until she came back to her feet, with a quick ease. Although it didn't stop much of the turkey who had been running from her and did not know she was still there, and in the middle of Themiscyra Dawn quickly drew her dagger, stabbing it through the heart of the turkey for an insta-kill. Dawn smirked lightly, grabbing the turkey and tossing it to a young amazon girl. <br>
<br>
 &quot;You know what to do, I don't cook.&quot;<br>
<br>
 After the short order for the girl she scurried off, Dawn spotted Hipp and she took a few long strides over to her Queen. Dressed in her usual dark forest green leathers for hunting and her sword along her side, and bow on her back she saluted her queen, smiling lightly.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Good Morning err...&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn glanced to the sky quickly, after hunting for a few days she had lost track of just what day or hour it was.<br>
<br>
 &quot;A little help? I seemed to have lost it...&quot;<br>
 <br>
 She laughed lightly tossing her long blonde hair back, green eyes sparkled lightly as she began to wonder where Alex had been these last few days, yes Alex. This would be the son she has kept secretive. Dawn then saw a tiny figure between Hipp and her, obviously a boy. She gently scooped him up by his neck, not gripping hard, raising him to look at her she smiled.<br>
<br>
 &quot;And what is your name?&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn's determined green eyes stared at him for a few lasting moments, her small form showed her strength and skill. One woman you wouldn't want to meet in a dark forest. She looked at him for a few moments, remembering the fact immortal children age very fast.<br>

He stood tall in respect of the amazon he stood before and as she looked down he could tell that she was in no mood to deal with a member of the male race.

He then heard the tall amazon speak his name.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am the child of the Scynthian Amazon Queen. And yes I am the Wulf you speak of.&quot;<br>

He spoke strong with words of wisdom and he held himself in great honor of the amazon who asked him a question, that he did not delay in his answer.

 &quot;You can be as good as anyone you want, with the right training and determination. You just have to want it bad enough to go through the gruling stages of it all.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Without kneeling Dawn yanked a golden dagger from the sheath around her boot, she spun it on the tip of her finger, the sharpened point baring a tiny hole in the skin of her hand. She then dropped her hand to the side and caught the dagger on its way down, flipping her wrist causing the dagger to twirl with it. She then stopped and held the blade out to the boy.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Lesson One. Smaller Weapons are easier to kill with, if you have the right speed and strength. Everyone I train gets one of my hand made daggers. Here is yours.&quot;<br>
<br>
 In the palm of Dawn's hand she held a single 1 foot dagger, it had a sliver blade with curved edges, but yet sharp. The hilt was golden with sliver and crimson jewels embedded, and at the base of the hilt where the blade and hilt met was her trade mark. Two strips of leather hung down off the blade, as well as two strips of wolf fur and tiger fur. Sheered in good faith.<br>

He grinned and fliped it up catching it in one hand behind his back. The blade was black and the hilt was of ivory from a sacred animal found by the shamans in Scynthia. He grinned and pulled it out in front of him and with the other hand he grabbed the dagger out from Dawn's hand and laid his own in hers.<br>

She turned it gently in her hands, fingers gently running over the blade and hilt. Then she threw it into the air and flipped high over the dagger speeding up as it went toward her. Her hand reached out to clasp the dagger as she rotated her flip and came back down to the ground and sheathed the dagger at her boot.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Impressive workmanship. You'll be a fine warrior, if you fight as good as make weapons. So when do you wish to start Wulf?&quot;<br>
<br>
 She sat indian style, her body getting comfortable in the dust, her head was canted and blonde hair gently fell about her face, framing it just right. For a moment you might actually think Dawn was just a young girl, not a warrior. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Amazon Wulf</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(11/2/00 8:10 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  She smiled.</span><hr size=1> He grinned at her words of his weaponry and skills.<br>
