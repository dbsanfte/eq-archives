She wore her black leather catsuit, her dark locks fell down past her shoulder, she walked to each statue starting with Hera, then Artemis, then Zeus, lighting a candle and placing it at the foot of each. DeL then walked to the middle of the circle that she had made with each candle and sat on the floor*<br>
<br>
* She spoke to Hera and Artemis first*<br>
<br>
I know your very busy with your um...Godding and all. I just ask you to help me. Hippolyte has placed alot of responcibility in my hands, Hera, I know you know what I speak of, as do you Artemis, but for know, I must be vague about it, until the time is right. I just need the strength to do as well as can be expected. I give my life to the Amazons as you know. I just need to know that the Gods and Goddess I respect will be there for me in times of need and advice...<br>

Greetings DeLerium ~ she walks into the circle and puts a hand out to the Amazon~ Please stand up my dear, I do not wish to look down on you. ~ She helps DeLerium up ~ Ahh Del, sweet DeL, you have come so far in your time as an Amazon, you've gone through many changes, and lived through many obsticles. Your heart is definitly an Amazon one.<br>
I know you are nervous about your present task at hand. Remember, I will be with you always, to give you guidance and strength if and when needed.<br>
<br>
You have given your life to Themsicrya and to Hippolyte.<br>
You are a true Amazon in my eyes and in my eyes you will excell with all that is put infront of you.<br>
<br>
~She brushes a strand of hair out of DeL's eyes and kisses her forehead~ You are as a daughter to me, all amazons are.<br>
And I will be here for you might you ever need me.<br>

Then a brilliant light shines and then disolves to reveal Hera, Queen of the Gods.  Icy blue eyes glance slowely to Artemis, &quot;Hello young hunter.&quot; She smiled as she spoke and then her eyes turned to DeLerium.<br>
&quot;DeLerium, yes I know you feel the presure of the future upon you.  But, you must keep yourself calm and at peace inside.  The tasks before you are great....and slowely they will grow with time,&quot; Hera sighed.  &quot;There are those in the Nation who you must learn to find a sort of respect for..even IF....they upset you inside.  It is a task Hippolyte has had to learn....and yet...is still learning.&quot;<br>
Hera walked up to DeL slowely and then smiled, &quot;I will give you my blessing.  And my words....remember...each Amazon is needed in the Nation.  You yourself are an extremely important part...as you well know.  You have grown and changed...don't forget those lessons you have learned.  And do not forget the past you have seen along side your athelfi.  In you dwells a great leader...and you know it.  I do not say this often...so listen closely.  DeLerium...learn from the Gods...pay attention to their good attributes..and take them as your own.  Learn from our...well.. our bad attributes..and pray you do not stumble as we have.  In your hands and soul...lay a piece of the future of the amazons.  Take my words seriously.  And go with renewed strength and wisdom.   Remember.. each link is needed.&quot; She lays a slender hand upon DeL's right shoulder.  &quot;Remember Hippolyte's words....Amazons Unite.  And keep it in your soul.  You have seen the growth..make it stronger.&quot;   <br>
<br>
Then suddenly, Hera dissappeared.  A single peacock feather lay where she once stood. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamazondelerium.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amazon DeLerium</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(8/17/01 6:04:31 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/deleriuml9/images/del2.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hera appears</span><hr size=1> ~ DeL blinked as Hera appeared, she bowed to her respectfully and listened to the words that she spoke, a soft smile on her lips. She agreed greatly with the Goddess on the aspects of respect, however, she was always taught that respect was a two way road,to only be given, if it were given first. She knew that not many of the Amazons knew much about her, only through tales of the Great centaur battle to take back Themiscrya. She also knew some amazons didnt think much of her, but she also didnt care about that. She could live with those who didnt like her, and fight side by side with them to defend the nation. She always put persoanl feelings aside at times of battle.~<br>
~She had put alot of thought into everything recently. The change was gradual, she didnt even known it had happened until that day with Dawn and the shapeshifter. She was glad she changed. Her acceptance of it made her a stronger Amazon. The ability to think rationally instead of stupidly and put others in danger was a great thing to her.~<br>
~She blinked again as Hera vanished, a smile on her lips, she bent over and picked up the peacock feather and placed it with the other feathers in her warmask. She always tried to learn by the Gods, they were, afterall, the Gods...and when they werent bickering or trying to manipulte mortals, they were wonderful beings...She smiled to Artemis who stood by her, then sat back down meditativly and closed her sea green eyes.~ <p>~*Amazon DeLerium*~
