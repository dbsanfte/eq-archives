&quot; Thanks for avenging my athelfi's death but it was my duty to avenge Alcippe! It's their chief...But I'll never find peace before I have at least one of those filthy Centaurs on my kill list!What are they doing, do you think they'll try to avenge their leader?&quot;<br>
<br>
The Amazon wasn't in mood to pardon to the Centaurs and in herself, she was saying:&quot;Just come and you'll all die!&quot; If the Centaurs would come, she would reserve them no pity.<br>
<br>
It was the first time she saw an half-lion and with her feathered war mask, the young Amazon was looking like a bird woman.She looks at the creature with fascination and admiration.But she wasn't in mood for friendship.Daphnike was one of the Themiscryan warriors who came to the Northern lands to participate to the Saurian wars and Alcippe's death affected her.She would never see the world the same.Before, she thinkt that the Amazons and Centaurs could coexist in peace.Now she think that her nation must destroy the Centaurs and that they can't coexist peacefully.<br>

She glanced away from him as Delilah came forth bringing a human-lion with her. Alysia stood and looked to her sister.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will speak with him Delilah, efharisto.&quot; She nodded to her athelfi and looked to the creature.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you have a name??&quot; She asked him.<br>
<br>
Alysia removed her war mask revealing Tiger striped paint upon her face. She was called the Clan Mother of the Odusians, the Tiger species. She had a feeling that this. . .  lion could be of some help to her and her people. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 300<br> <font color=#993300>(8/25/01 12:46:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Coming to battle.</span><hr size=1>  Dawn had awoke early, back in her body at Themiscry. Emeralds were weak at first when she glanced around the brightly lit pine forest and then to her tigers. At that moment she knew she would be of no help to Alysia unless she went to the war in the flesh. That was just what she did.<br>
<br>
 All four of her large black paws hit the dirt floor and took off. It'd only be a half days travel in tiger form.<br>
<br>
*Later that Day*<br>
<br>
 The exhausted demonic tiger padded into the camp, of weary amazons rallying together to fight. Just like the ground of the camp, Dawn was muddy and wet, her fur matted to her flesh. The tiger's emerald orbs glanced to everyone around the camp, before making her way to the Queen's tent. <br>
<br>
 Upon the tiger's arrival into the tent, and not knowing the circumstances of who was in there, the tiger glanced to Alysia, and nodded. About that time, the room fell pitch dark, like battle at midnight. . and when the light reappeared in the room, and everyones eyes adjusted to the light once more, the amazon assassin stood before them. This time in the flesh.<br>
<br>
 Dawn was dressed in her usual amazon attire, with more weaponary though. Clad in her leather pants, and corsit, as well as her elven boots. Upon her thigh was a knife, sheathed, and around her ankles were the usual four daggers. Upon her back was two swords, in the diagram of an X, each hilt was available with the flip of a wrist. On Dawn's left shoulder was a shielding, with a tiny glimpse of a knife hilt, that was quick to access by the warrior. On Dawn's opposite arm was the bold marking of Ares, the only tattoo seen on her body. The other LaTra tattoo usually shown was covered by her black guantlets, that covered her forarms. <br>
<br>
 Those bold emeralds glanced to Alysia.<br>
<br>
 &quot;No way am I letting our son fight without both of his mothers. Besides.. this isn't the place for Belle to make her first kill.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn smiled faintly, before glancing over her shoulder to look at the camp once more. The assassin fell silent as she looked back at Alysia, that's where they had remained her entire time, on the LaTra. After her silence she nodded once, as she settled down in a chair, near the map that she began to study.. muttering only a few words for her athelfi.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Bonded for life.&quot;<br>

I hope this rain ceases soon.::He spoke to himself,he liked the rain,but not that much.He then yawns heavily,those sharp conical teeth quite visable,as he digs his front claws into the bark of the tree and stretches his muscles,his back claws flexing in the mud beneath him.He then lets out a short grunt and pulls his claws from the bark of the tree,slightly tearing some of the bark from it.He looks around for a moment,then sits down,leaning against the tree and crossing his strong muscled arms behind his head and closing his eyes lightly.:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamazondelerium.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amazon DeLerium</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#993300>(8/25/01 7:23:10 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/deleriuml9/images/del2.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get around</span><hr size=1> ~ DeL walks over from her tent to Daphnike with a small smile on her lips, she salutes her.~<br>

The MUN and creator of this SL needs to know the info that your character wants to put in, like the battle scenes, because as you can see, this isnt a regular Ezboard RP SL, it is more like a story that you respond to afterwards. But anyways, please email: ElitheDevi@aol.com and tell him what you want to have happen with your character! Seeing how long this SL is going to be, we need your input ASAP! Thanks! - )<br>

Alysia turned and smiled in Artemis' pressense. She had an awkward feeling like she did when she was a young amazon and was blessed by Artemis and Athena. She shook the feeling and turned to Dawn nodding.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course Dawn, will everyone please excuse us?&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked to those in her tent and watched as everyone filed out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=daphnikearephiparthenia>Daphnike Arephi Parthenia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#993300>(8/25/01 9:14:02 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://mrmagoo.fortunecity.com/royo/secret/secret03.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get around/ Strategy</span><hr size=1> &quot;Yasoo Princess&quot;says Daphnike respectfully after DeL saluted her.&quot; It's the duty of every Amazon to protect her athelfi,it's what I came, even if I'm not kalos orisate in the Northern Lands, long story...It's not the time to talk about the past but to find a strategy, and soon...&quot; After a long reflexion she says:&quot; Saurians are redoubtable warriors but I think there's a way to defeat them, or at least to be protected from them.If we hide up trees, not only they'll be all in our view but we willn't be in their reach,that'll give us a great advantage.With bows, we could defeat them while they'll attack from the ground.If we all aim them from trees, our enemies will have no chance and declare reddition.&quot;
