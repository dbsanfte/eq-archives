The figure who practically fell through the entrance, limping with such exhaustion he surely was nearly dead, was fairly solid, muscular, and filthy. The russet tunic was torn and burnt, sleeves ripped and a fine coat of dust and grime clinging to nearly every seam of his ragged garments. What remained of his boots was nothing but worn thing leather. Whiskers forming a dark shadow along the length of his jaws and swell of his throat added to the rough outlook. His dark hair, cut in obvious Roman fashion though disheveled, blood long since dried on his cheeks and limbs. With equal urgency, he found a jug of what he hoped to be water by the door, lifting it with both large hands and drinking deeply from it.<br>
<br>
Rattled on her stool the small tavern keeper had to grasp hold of the shelf she was on in order not to fall over.  Startled she placed the last bottle of wine in its place and quickly moved down the steps and out the kitchen door to the common room. Eyes narrowed and quickly scanned the room to find one of her patrons had reached for a spear and was approaching the door.  <br>
<br>
“No! Clonie, wait!” Cyrene wiped her apron between her palms. She stepped around the bar and pushed the sweat and hair off her brow.<br>
<br>
“He's not going to do any harm.” With a soft, yet stern gaze, the older tavern keeper stood next to the large Amazon, took the spear, and placed it against the booth.<br>
<br>
“Sir?” she asked keeping a grip on the muscled arm of the female warrior to steady her in place.<br>
<br>
Even as unbearable fatigue dimmed the brightness of his keen blue gaze a fair bit, the eyes he turned toward the woman addressing him still held some of their former hunger and intelligence - only now a great deal of confusion dwelled in their depths.  Water trickled down his chin and slipped like drops of rain onto the torn surface of his tunic, meaty hands still clutching the jug as though he held a beloved babe in his arms. He looked to her, then to the one who surely would have killed him where he stood, and back again, disoriented, starving, ready to succumb to madness.<br>
<br>
“Ye…yes…yes?” he cleared his throat and regained his <br>
composure somewhat, squaring his shoulders and glancing at the now dormant spear. Nothing in his eyes was the least bit threatening. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cyrene@amazonsunite>Cyrene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#993300>(10/30/02 3:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=412.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/cyreneamphipolis/cyrene005.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The unexpected visitor</span><hr size=1> &quot;Roman!&quot; Clonie growled and made an attempt as if to move forward.<br>
<br>
“Wait! I said,” Cyrene hissed and held firm watching the man carefully.<br>
<br>
Lifting her chin in the direction of the hearth, she spoke to the warrior, “Bread, can you bring me some,Please?”<br>
<br>
Clonie left too slowly and made the journey to the cooking hearth in the large common room. Leaving the older woman with the stranger, she took the towel from the waist of her apron.<br>
<br>
“Let’s see if we can get you sitting away from the door.  Someone is liable to trip,” the dark haired woman's voice was rich and her silvery blue eyes burned with warmth almost un-earthy in their embrace.  Offering her palm out with the towel, she stepped back to the nearest booth.<br>
<br>
“I think adding a stubbed toe to your state at the moment would not improve the mood.”<br>
<br>
The humor was completely lost, of course, as he squinted and attempted to clear his vision after nearly being blinded by the sun. Just how long had it been? He had traveled by horse - and then on foot once the horse had collapsed from the journey - for as long as he could remember. Memory, how amusing the man thought to himself. He realized, once he tried to think about it, that he had nothing of the sort. Just, exhaustion. He felt his head nod as she handed over the towel, transferring it to his own hand more gently than he could be given credit for at first glance. The cloth felt smooth against his blood and sweat-stained face, soft against the sun's damage and oddly comforting. When he lifted it again, he was able to focus a bit more clearly, the realization of what sort of establishment he had entered beginning to sink in.<br>
<br>
A slender brow had hidden in thick silver-brushed black curls as the stranger continued to be the center of attention.  Clonie had returned with the bread and placed it in the booth behind the older woman.<br>
<br>
“Now, I think you should sit down.  I have some bread for you, but only if you eat it slowly.  I won't have you passing out, I can't lift you and I don't trust these women to the task,” warmth once more crossed aged features while every other face of the half dozen women collected was cold as stone.  Like a pack of wolves about to strike a few paced back in the shadows and one stepped into the light behind the older tavern keeper, “And be careful of my fierce friends.  They won't hesitate to put you out of your misery.”<br>
<br>
The water had moistened his throat well enough so that he could get words out in a gruff manner at least.  Nodding his head once in a respectful gesture of thanks - she looked to be perhaps fifteen to twenty years his senior - he turned his body just enough to take the nearest seat while keeping a wary eye on the well-armed patrons who studied him with obvious hatred simmering in their eyes. Was that a ghost of a smile visible on his mouth before it vanished just as quickly? It felt divine to get off his feet, his legs ached so greatly he was not sure how much longer he'd have been able to travel past the little tavern. Leaning back in his seat, he raked grimy fingers through the hair that once was much shorter. “I thank you, Lady, for your hospitality.”<br>
<br>
“You are welcome, it is my job,” mercury blue turned to Clonie who seemed to have relaxed and moved back to her own seat to join the other Amazons in conversation.  They were a protective lot, and not once did two pair of eyes stray away from the small tavern keeper. “Bread, it's soft, and I'll bring you some broth.  Mind if you swallow too much I'll be cleaning it off the floor.” <br>
<br>
Cyrene had seen this state before.  The tavern bordered the North of Themyscira, Amazon lands, and the terrain was not in the least kind to travelers who were prepared to weather the pass and river.  It appeared this stranger was ill prepared for the journey.  Surprise dawned in the back of her mind as to how he had gone without detection before he reached the tavern, then again, the winter hunt was still going and most of her sisters were busy.  The small woman turned and faded into a silhouette against the large hearth that covered the common room's west wall almost completely. There she stayed gathering a tray for the stranger. <br>
<br>
His head lulling to one side, he met the gaze of one of the stern-faced warriors and slowly held up his hands, palms outward.  A signal that he had not a weapon on his person, not even equipped with a knife.  Possibly all that had kept him alive was his own stubborn will to do so and even that was a guess. The back of his head throbbed wildly still, tender to the touch when he ran his fingers through the dark locks plastered by sweat and blood to his skull. Surely, he should have remembered THAT, at least, the swollen knot making him wince. His belly grumbled with a low, heavy growl, every muscle straining to relax.<br>
<br>
Slow moments passed and the small woman returned with a heavy tray muscle played against flesh showing the weight no burden. Upon the worn wood sat a large bowl of thick stew, a tray of hard cheese and fresh fruit, a small tin of dried dates and figs, a stout mug of something steaming smelling strong of herbs.  Placed before the man she stepped back and picked out an eating stick from her back apron pocket. “I'd try the tea first it'll settle things.” The whole lot smelled of rich curry and hearty grains. Through the slow rising din of the room, the keeper answered a question shouted out to her before turning her attention back. “If you'd like to clean up first let me know, but I think you could use the food first.” Offering a nod of respect the smiling older woman turned and rushed over to one of the tables.<br>
<br>
“I would not flirt with a Roman, Dosa; I've seen you flirt with that horse of yours!  I'm getting your ale, I'm getting it!”<br>
<br>
“Hey!” <br>
<br>
“What'd I say about throwing my tankards? I'm getting your ale.  Hold your horses.” With a laugh, the older woman dodges another mug and ducks to the safety of the bar.<br>
With another rumble of his belly, he leaned forward and gingerly tore a hunk from the bread and lifted it to sunburned lips. The taste of food upon his tongue roused his hunger, and he surely would have gorged himself in seconds had he not heeded her earlier warning to be cautious. Those meaty, calloused and strong hands pulled at the figs and shoved in a mouthful of cheese, the weary but intelligent gaze still watching the others in the tavern. Not that he could have put up much of a fight at that moment, unarmed, weak and completely lost.<br>
<br>
Appearing once more to refill mugs, tankards and bowls, the older woman's brow beaded with unnoticed sweat.  An unwavering smile offered to everyone and a laugh for every joke.  It was not the fake sort of action one would find in royalty or common life.  The dark-haired woman appeared to be completely happy and at ease with life.  It was rare to have such pure and strong emotion offered so honestly with a smile and her patrons drawn to buy another drink with just her passing.  The keeper did not glance back at the stranger's table as she worked, allowing the time he needed to Adjust.<br>

Then an overwhelming sadness would threaten to force his head to the table, and he fought to keep himself upright, still unsure of the origins of the images flooding his consciousness and disappearing just as rapidly. The smell of death, burning fields, charred flesh, stamped in his memory, but without the meaning clear, he felt only that stab of disorientation, the confusion felt by one whose emotions had no immediate explanation. He stared at nothing for several minutes, trying to reach for a glimpse of a memory barely within his grasp, and then it was gone, tormenting him, elusive beasts hell-bent on torturing him into madness. The hungry gaze lifted once more, catching another glance from one of the Amazons, and he held it boldly before dropping it to his bowl.<br>
<br>
“It's not unusual for us to have male guests in the tavern.” The keeper's voice came from behind him and moved slowly along the table into his view in order to ease the starkness of her approach. “I'm sure it's been some years since they've seen someone who appears to be Roman.  Such as your-self,” a lopsided smile tugged at her lips as she placed a bowl of water down across from him. “And I'm sure the last one that was in here carried a sword along with a threat.  Didn't come in as dirty as you, but sure left it.” <br>
<br>
Hidden memory caused a glint in her eye as she dug out the rest of what she had brought over. “If you keep that down you can have more.”<br>
<br>
Bandages, clean soft cloth and various salves placed beside the bowl of water. “I trust you know what to do with this?” Something in the woman's silvery gaze shown that she was looking, not through him, but at every detail about him without removing her gaze from his eyes it was something unsettling.  She gave the posture that somehow she knew your deepest secrets, yet would not tell that secret even to her best friend.<br>
<br>
He nodded his dark head once in acknowledgement, obviously a man of few words and possessing of more caution than other men of his caliber might otherwise have been in such surroundings.  Those eyes noted every movement made by the others, his manner a strange combination of resignation to a welcome death and an inner and ongoing fight to survive at all cost.<br>
<br>
“You are most kind, Lady. I apologize for the intrusion.  Please reassure your guests that, Roman or no, if that is in fact what I am, I think, will the Gods not make it known to me here? I mean no harm in this place. I would have asked where this place happened to be, but…” his voice trailed off, something familiar at least, something he had read about his current location. Oh yes, the other patrons only proved the matter, clarified that at least.<br>
<br>
“You are at the Labrys, a tavern on the Northern border of Themyscira, Amazon lands,” she answered. Dipping a corner of the rag into the water, she grabbed his hand and started to clean them.  It was a motherly instinct that it seemed to annoy her to see something so sorry, not pity. The only thing that will reassure them is your actions.  Right now they're at peace.” Wrinkling her nose she caught a draft from the man, it must have been quite a journey, with not many stops. “You should change cloths or you might get sick,” continues the firm but gentle tending of cleaning his hands as she spoke. “Oh, and if this old lady here is overstepping just tell her to stop being a mother.  She won't bite,”<br>
<br>
Her words, manner and sincere kindness actually did bring a slight smile to the man's lips, and it lent a touch of youth to a face that had aged greatly over the past few weeks. He seemed almost boyish when he managed that smile, although the lines burned into the flesh beneath his eyes from sun and strain did not diminish.  He offered a quick nod and glance toward one of the tables before turning his attention to his hostess, allowing her to continue her matronly attentions. “Change clothes, indeed. This,” tugging at his tunic with his free hand, “to my knowledge is all I have, Lady. And somehow I doubt very much your guests would care to see me dining in nothing but a loin cloth.” Suddenly he went pale, the realization of what little he had finally sinking in. Pushing the tray of food away, he widened his eyes in embarrassment. “Lady, I also have no payment for all this.”<br>
<br>
“No, a loin cloth would not be a very good idea.  However, let me see what I can find in the stores.  Some of the gals around here grow bit.” Now the lopsided grin turned positively crooked and she glanced down at the clean hand. “I have payment for this. And don't argue a good deed for a good deed.” Grabbing the other hand, she started work anew and shrugged a blue clothed shoulder. “When you're better I've got a roof that needs a look at.  I do not have the time.  If you don't have the time then the next person you see on the road, tell them where they can find the best curry stew in all Greece.” Winking she finished and used the salve before unrolling the bandages.<br>
<br>
The nod he gave then was almost shy humbled as he was while she tended to his person. “I am at your service, Lady. For a moment, I thought your tavern was merely an illusion, as if I had already died long before reaching this place. There was no air of cruelty surrounding this particular fellow, as there may well have been with other Romans who had passed through before him.  In addition, just as the warriors had proclaimed when he had first arrived, he must surely be of the Romans himself.  The tear in his sleeve at his shoulder, if he turned a certain way, would reveal the marking on his flesh, which may one day help him grasp those memories with more clarity. Yet, he had not noticed the letters dotting the grimy skin, SPQR. “I shall be all too glad to assist with your needed repairs.”<br>
<br>
The older woman's lips pursed when she noted the marking.  She had no hate for the Romans she also had no love for them.  It did not change her gentle motions and she did not stop until his arms face and head were as clean as she could get them. “Looks like you caught a nasty hit, in more than one place.  Hope the other one looks worse than you.”  Clearing her throat the small woman stood up and rubbed the cloth of apron between her hands.  It seemed to be a long deep seeded habit with the keeper. “I am Cyrene Raven of Amphipolis, please call me Cyrene.” With that said, she turned and disappeared behind one of the doors in the common room in search of something for him to wear, and a place for him to sleep.<br>
<br>
His head still pounded from the swollen lump at the back of his skull, and he winced a bit while straining to remember what had caused it.  Still the images danced just out of his grasp, intent on causing him&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp further mental anguish until surely he would seize them from a deep sleep, cry out in the night through sweat-soaked sheets. For a moment, he nearly gave in to the overwhelming urge to hold his head against the table and sob into the hands she had scrubbed clean, weep until the reasons for the tears made them-selves known. Instead, he surrendered once more to the confusion and exhaled a deep breath, absently chewing on another fig and watching the Amazons conversing at their nearby tables.<br>
<br>
“This should suit you well just plain tunics and breeches.  Forest gear for guests I assume.” Making her entrance by plopping some cloth down on the seat, “also I've readied one of the rooms downstairs, it's smaller but it'll keep you out of trouble,” she glanced past her shoulder to her sisters. “I'm going to warn you.  If you chose to go any further south from here, I cannot vouch for your safety.  Men are forbidden on Amazon lands without permission from the Queen, and that you do not have.  If you plan to travel south, go west, then south through centaur lands.  They will offer you safe passage and a guide to the mountains. And where to then, I wonder?” Said more to him than her or anyone else present, he nodded once more and lifted the clothes she had brought. While she had been out of sight, he had quietly grasped a small blade used for slicing cheese from a nearby table. Not much of a weapon compared to the steel carried by the women currently lounging in Cyrene's tavern, but he felt a bit more at ease with something at least, no matter how insignificant it might prove to be. &quot;I do thank you for your kindness, Lady.” Another humble smile as he quickly corrected himself with a barely audible chuckle, “Cyrene.”<br>
<br>
“Do I call you Roman or just Sir?” It was a joke meant to ease its way into introductions, “or traveler?” Seeing that his meal seemed to be agreeing with him, she moved off to fetch a loaf of sweet raisin and nut bread.  A pillow whip of sweet cream butter rested in a cup by the loaf. She sat down and fixed herself a slice before pushing it over to him. Apparently, there was a lull in the calls for refills.  Two of the patrons had already left the tavern due to guard duty and none had come to join their companions in a drink.  It was a slow night, and the keeper seemed to be enjoying herself.<br>
<br>
“Oh, do forgive my lack of manners, Lady.” He dropped the fig he had been holding, extended a hand, opening his mouth as if to introduce his-self formally but the words died on his lips, his eyes lowering, blinking, dark brows furrowed as frustration at his failed memory clouded his mood. Another sigh and he lowered his hand, forcing another chuckle with a shake of his head. “I suppose you're free to address me however you wish. Something tells me,” a quick sweep of his blue-eyed gaze over the others present, “I've been labeled worse tonight.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, you have,” the older woman laughed and took his hand anyway. “I will call you Sir.  You seem too noble to be called a Roman, too old to be called ‘You’ and it is just not as easy to say traveler as it is Sir. ”Giving his hand a firm grip she retrieved it and took a large bite of the bread.  Following with a quick drink from the mug, she had brought with her. “I'll need to start closing soon, you stay here and eat as long as you'd like, the fire will start to die in about a candle-mark.  That is when I will lock the door.  Did you have a horse that needed tending?”<br>
<br>
He shook his head, eyes regaining their reflective, faraway glimmer as they focused on the flames flickering further away. “The horse I had joined the gods some days ago. I'm afraid he wasn't as stubborn as I was.”<br>
<br>
“Poor beast, well I am sure it is peaceful.” Standing she stuffed the last bit of bread into her mouth and moved away, “I will speak with you later, Sir, and show you your room for the night. Nodding she moved away to the last remaining table and clapped an Amazon's shoulder as she passed.<br>
<br>
It was true, he did feel a fair bit more comfortable with the blade against his thigh, and not that such a small item would be much use against an Amazon's sword.  Small comfort, he would take it anyway, and leaning back in his seat, he chewed a bit of the sweet bread thoughtfully, soothed by the firelight and the kindhearted manner in which his hostess had taken to him when the others would surely have cheered over his mutilated corpse. A stranger in a strange land, a man who could not even summon his own name, it was laughable, really, although he did not feel at all like laughing. More like screaming.<br>
<br>
Cyrene had come back and shown him where the room was and gave him the key, instructing him what to do if there was any danger. His door sported a ladder to the second floor that would allow him safe passage out of the tavern. She had wished him good night and told him when breakfast promptly was.  A warm smile and a nod the small woman had left to tend to her nightly duties in the tavern, setting up chairs and tables, pushing the drunken guests out and setting up for the next morning.<br>
<br>
He had thanked her before taking his leave, giving his word to keep his promise and tend to the fixing of her roof.<br>

<br>
Queen De'Lerium pushed open the door with a bang and gazed around the tavern with cold sea green eyes.<br>
Spotting the male, she walked over briskly, unsheathing her sword. She walked up behind him, grabbing ahandfull of his hair, and pulling back his head, her sword went to his throat, and she held it there firmly, one false move and his throat would be sliced open like so much meat.<br>
<br>
She looked to Cyrene<br>
&quot;What is the meaning of this, serving a Roman in our lands. Mayhaps you should know more about the Amazons past before you go welcoming every stranger who sets foot here in the City of the Amazons.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her eyes flashed anger, rage. She hated the Romans as much as the Centuars for what they did to her people. <p>         ~~* De'Lerium *~~ &lt;br&gt;<br>

Meeting eyes with the Amazon Queen she bowed her head in respect.  Blue eyes narrowed as she eyed the sword, then the stranger before turning her attention back to the Queen.<br>
<br>
&quot;Forgive me my Queen, for I saw not a Roman, not a man, but a starving human being.&quot;  Controlling her own temper, she stepped back away from the table and around the side. &quot;Call me a foolish old woman, for I was a mother to sons once.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I was under the impression it was my job to make strangers welcome. Then again I am old and set in my ways.&quot; Taking a deep breath she met the Queen's eyes unwavering, &quot;I left what you would call normal civilization because of prejudices.  You are right, I should know more about the Amazons. Teach me now, are the Amazons butchers?&quot;<br>
<br>
The older woman's eyes flicked down to the starved man who was in no position to fight against the strength of the Queen holding him at death's doors.<br>

A chuckle escaping her throat.<br>
&quot; You aren't the only one around here who have had sons. Many of us had. And no, the Amazons are not butchers...would you like me to tell you the story of a great war, a war between the Romans and the Amazons. A war started because the Romans would not accept that races of woman could not live without them. Would you like to hear how they tourtured and raped and killed our people, and sold many into slaves to be raped and abused by there masters. Those who would not submitt, were butchered. There body parts sent to the amazon nations as proof of what they would, could do? Hmmm?&quot;<br>
Her grip tightened on the males hair, nails digging into his scalp.<br>
&quot;These pigs slaughtered us by the hundreds. Themiscrya is the City of Amazons, the Greatest city , a sisterhood of strength and bonds. We have changed our ways slightly from the past. We too much change with the times. I remember a day, many many moons ago when I would of just walked in here, and killed him.....slowly. Not saying a word.<br>
<br>
As she spoke, the Amazon Guards around her circled them, not to close, but not to far. One, blocking the door, the only entrance or exit to the Tavern.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Labry's has seen its fair share of bloodshed throughout the time that we have been here. And no Roman is allowed within our lands. I see it as an act of war, defience. The wood he had to walk through to get to us was clearly marked as Amazon territory.  We, the Sisters of Themiscrya are Hera's Chosen. All of Greece and Rome know of us.&quot;<br>
<br>
She removed her sword and picked the male up by his hair, throwing him to the ground, she then moved in, posed for a strick, the tip of her blade shoved into his neck, enough for a trickle of blood to pour slowly out. Not bad enough to kill him. Her grey wolf, Lukoi came to stand besides her.<br>
<br>
&quot;He can have his freedom, He must declare here, and now, that woman are not mens toys to do what they please with, I want him to beg for his very life. Beg me to let him live his sorry exsistance of this Roman life. He does this, and he has till sunup to get as far from Amazon Terriroty as his feet can take him. If he is found in our territory at sunlight, he will be killed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her seagreen eyes narrowed at the male at the end of her sword.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is, your choice.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cyreneraven>Cyrene Raven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Owner and Merchant</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#993300>(11/2/02 11:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=412.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/cyreneamphipolis/cyrene005.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Choice</span><hr size=1> Cyrene closed her eyes and bowed her head low to the Queen in respect.  Pale eyes turned to the stranger and the innkeeper sighed.<br>
<br>
He raised himself up on his knees and held his hands to his sides. &quot;Women, are not toys.  The idea turns my stomach to think such a thought.  I, too, have lost much to the Romans.&quot; With that the stranger turned his eyes upward, sorrow filled and void of life, he turned his head to one side exposing the wound in his neck.<br>
<br>
&quot;My son was trampled under the hooves of the horses that rode to my home with the intent to murder me.  In my home they found my wife, not me. They took my wife...took her light and then burned it.  I found her hanging with her body torn to pieces, my son's charred body on the road.&quot; The memories threatened to overtake him as the emotion cracked his voice and tore at his heart. The venom of his hatred for the hideous act that ended his family vomited from his throat to spill out onto those ears who would listen. &quot;ROME! That is who held the sword.  Her Legions preying on a small farm and a noble family. ROMAN LIFE?!&quot;<br>
<br>
Struggling for breath the stranger's hands trembled and he placed them on the floor. Meeting the Queen's eyes his voice seemed lost, rough yet clear. &quot;Do with me what you will, for I am not what you see.  The only thing I do know is, what worth would I have as a man, as a mortal, to beg for such a useless thing as a Roman life?  I have humbled myself before you, but I will not disrespect the memory of my wife and son by losing my honor in begging for my life. The one thing I have left in this life is revenge. I ask that if I die now unavenged, that you kill me quickly, so that I may start my work in another life.&quot;<br>
<br>
The older woman moved to right her chair and once it was settled back on four legs she took a heavy lean against it.  Holding her breath she stared between the Amazon Queen and the stranger.  She suddenly felt as Pandora did; the box open and the only option left was to watch, helpless, as chaos and distruction reigned. Death had been a constant at times in her life and she feared here she would witness it again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=amazondelerium>Amazon DeLerium</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Queen</span><br>  Posts: 405<br> <font color=#993300>(11/3/02 10:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=412.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/deleriuml9/images/del2.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Choice</span><hr size=1> She looked to Cyrene as the male spoke, then back to him. Rage still played like fire in her eyes. When he was done telling his tale, she looked back to Cyrene.<br>
<br>
&quot; So now that you hear his story, are the amazons the butchers or the Romans?&quot;<br>
<br>
Her eyes met the males and she withdrew her sword, sheathing it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Get up, and get out. I am sorry for the loss of your family, but it does not surprise me either what the Romans did to them.&quot;<br>
<br>
She turned her back and headed to the door.<br>
<br>
&quot;Be gone from the village by first light.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that, she stormed out of the tavern <p>         ~~* De'Lerium *~~ &lt;br&gt;<br>
