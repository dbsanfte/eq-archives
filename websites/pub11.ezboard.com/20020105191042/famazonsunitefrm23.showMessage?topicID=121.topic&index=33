A broad smile crossed the minotaur's face.  He liked when the odds were stacked against him.  The minotaur then snapped his fingers as a few hundred more cobalts rose from the ground::<br>

A glare of red crossed Mojo's eyes as the axe began glowing and humming with magical power.  It would take someone with nearly the strength of a Titan or a God to wield such an axe.  Mojo inherited that strength from his Titan grandfather.  He then pointed towards Dionysus and his &quot;brood&quot; as another couple of hundred cobalts rose from the ground and attacked the centaurs::<br>
<br>
::Mojo with his enormous strength and the cobalts, cut through the most of the small army of centaurs like hot butter until he could get to the catapults.  Using the blade of his axe he systematically cut the ropes on each of the catapults, essentially making all of them useless.  Allowing the cobalts to fight it out with the centaurs, he slowly walked over to Dionysus.  He knew better than to strike a god since he himself was not one.  He set the axe head on the ground holding onto the handle showing he would not attack him::<br>
<br>
&quot;Dionysus...You are not a war god.  Therefore I SUGGEST you step off the battlefield, for it is not your domain.  I know better than to strike or attack you personally, but that same respect is not extended to that 'army' you brought with you.  Therefore I suggest you lead them off the field before they are all dead.&quot;<br>

::He then turns away from Dionysus and started hacking through the centaurs again, with his axe, gorging a few of them in their bodies with his large horns.
