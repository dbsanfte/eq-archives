Now she could safely meet her sister, and try to repair any and all of the wounds she suffered, both mentally and physically, while she was bound in the prison. She hopped off of her horse, and helped Zelia down, kissed her cheek, and headed over to May's horse to retrieve Lysippe. She gasped when she saw the amount of cuts and bruises that littered her little sister's body. Her rage began to boil in her veins again at the mistreatment of her sister... if there were this many external injuries, what of the internal ones?<br>
<br>
Tears welled in her eyes as she gently lifted Lysippe from the back of May's horse and carried the limp, helpless girl like a baby back to her and Zel's hut. She laid her in their bed, and pulled the fur blankets up over her, gazing sadly upon her sleeping form. <p><html> <font face="Signet Roundhand ATT" size="+1"> Varia Angelina Avande </font> </html></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uiizeliaii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>II Zelia II</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#993300>(3/9/02 11:07:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=106>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Home...</span><hr size=1> And Zelia gots home with Var and all. <br>
<br>
Be's helped off the horse.<br>
<br>
She remains standing beside Vars horse. Looking around with her still blinded eyes. She blinks a few times,but still,she could not see anything except black and grey blots here and there. She extends her left hand out,and pats Varias horse on the side,probobly just making sure she was still in the same spot. She then feels around,until she grips the horses reigns,feeling a little comfort next to the large animal,atleast until the horse,snorts and decides to trot off! And Zelia having her hand wrapped around the reigns,gets pulled almost off her feet. &quot;Woah woah woah!&quot; She braces her feet on the ground,but still manages to get dragged some,her feet sliding along the ground,until she finally gets her hand free!  &quot;Holy Hades!&quot; Rubs her hand once she had finally gotten it free. Then shakes a fist toward the horse,but since she cant exactly see where it was running off to,she ends up shaking her fist in the total opposite direction. &quot;CRAZY ANIMAL!&quot; She drops her hand to her side,and calms herself. <br>
<br>
Begins to try and look around for Varia,not really having the slightest clue that Var had taken her unconsious sister into thier hut. Well,since she can't see,she'll just have to use her hightened sence of smell,which of course,directs her in the right direction,and she begins to walk,following the familiar scent that was Varia.<br>
<br>
dum dee dum. Walking walking. Then,she finally reaches the steps to the hut. Carefully she steps up the steps,then walks toward the hut door.<br>
<br>
BAM. Smacks face first into the side paneling of the door.<br>
&quot;SonOfABacchae!&quot; She growls,then takes one step to the side,and then extends a hand out,to make sure that NOW she was clear to walk into the hut. All clear!  So she takes a few steps. A pleased smile playing on her lips. &quot;Var-&quot; But,before she could finish calling out to her wife....she trips over a table,immediatly she tries to grab onto the nearest thin so she can catch her fall,she grabs onto what would be a chair,but not a sturdy enough chair to catch her fall. And she crashes anyways,to the floor with a loud thuding crash. Table and chair both timbering atop of her.<br>
<br>
She groans,and gives up and just lays on the floor with the heavy wooden tables just laying atop her lower half,but the chair,the chair she flings in the direction she had come.
