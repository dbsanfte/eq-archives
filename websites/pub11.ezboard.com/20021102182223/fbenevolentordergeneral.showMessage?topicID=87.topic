This guild has problems.  For those that are unsure of what i mean, let me clarify.<br>
<br>
A couple of months ago and about 14 levels in game terms i first met up with this guild.  Having known elupis for a while, and considered they needed my talents in mistmoore joined up with them.  Since, from what emanie was saying, that they were going to be doing most of their raid chatting through guildspeak she invited me and my alter ego Sarnian into the guild to help out.  Reluctantly i accepted even though i, as sarnian, was asked to join Shining alliance.  After the raid was over, it felt like to much work to disband myself from the guild and i gotta admit it felt good to be a part of an organization.  Perhaps, i though, i could even teach them a thing or two.   As such i decided to put my plans on joining SA on hold.<br>
<br>
At first it was loads of fun.  I had the chance to meet and group with new people and at the time the guild seemed pretty much structured, and there was a sense of belonging.  Me and elupis started to actually hunt together, and i managed to take him to a few new places and new experiences.<br>
<br>
However, in the period of about 2 months all that seemed to change.  The sense of belonging is gone, replaced by almost a sort of apathy.  There seems to be no guild structure in place, hell i dont even know who all the officers are.  All of a sudden all Ben order seems to be is a title beside my name.  Ill be honest with you all and say this isnt how i want to spend what might very well be my last month on EQ.  As well, i have talked to a few people who have agreed with me and are thinking of leaving. <br>
<br>
There is another issue at hand.  Unless i had it comepletely wrong we had set guidelines for recruiting new members including a level limit set at 20.  Well if that limit is in place why do i see so many pre 20 characters every time i log on.  im not talking about one or two im talking about 60% of the guild roster. Yeah i know a few of them are alternates of characters already in the guild but what of those that arent.  I mean if you are going to have a policy in place then that should be enforced WITHOUT EXCEPTION.  I dont care if they are your rl best friend and you have known each other for 100 years. When a policy is decided on then its decided on.<br>
Speaking of policy, what is our recruitment policy.  Is it just for officers to invite whoever they wish?  If so then im sorry to say, its adios for me.  If a guild does not have a set of requirements for joining, then the guild becomes just a name over your head.  Something like that happened to me before when i was involved with Guardians of honor.  In the end, because there was no set guild structure it fell apart very rapidly.  From the way things are going now this guild will end up just like that.   The only difference is that Guardians had some @#%$s in the guild as a result of this open ended recruitment policy.<br>
<br>
RECOMMENDATIONS<br>
*Have a concrete set of guidlines and rules and post them on the guild webpage, with clear entrance requirements.<br>
* If the no new recruits less then 20 rule is decided then STICK WITH IT.  No exception, period<br>
* have a minimum level of 15 before alternates of characters already in the guild are accepted.<br>
*have officer meetings at least once a month to discuss events, and issues regarding the guild.<br>
*Have regular guildmeetings at the same intervals.  They can be fun or serious depending on the situation<br>
*Have a strict disciplinary guide for anyone compromising the guild's reputation. i.e., ksing, intentional training, etc.<br>
*Have a penalty of removal of officer status for any officer inviting anyone without going through the proper channels<br>
*Have an officer meeting to discuss all of the above.<br>
<br>
Thats basically all i have to say, My hopes were that as i grew up in level, so would the guild.  However i am finding that is not the case.  Maybe i was expecting Ben order to turn into a mid level guild overnight.  If that is the case, then it is my bad.  I guess I, as Sarnian, have that mindset as i have many friends that are part of high level guilds, like Pandarus Ad Infinitum, The Trinity Alliance, and Society of Shadows.<br>
<br>
So what am i going to do?  Well, i had a good discussion with elupis and he wants to see change as much as i do.  However we are only two people.  Its up to you guys to see to it that Ben order doesnt become a dying fire.  However if things dont start to change soon, then i will have no choice but to remove myself.<br>

     I understand totally what you are saying even though I don't say a lot through guild or other things me and El have talked as well and I agree on a lot of the issues that you have talked about so don't feel as if you are alone. It seems to me also that the guild has gone thru some changes lately in the last month or so for the worst I hate to say and yes some things do need to change I agree, so don't feel as if you are the only one who feels this way. As I told El this is my third guild,my first was Knights of the Realm and it folded in much the same way as the guild you described with no structure and no set guidelines and I would hate to see this happen to Ben order as I have many friends here and many people who I admire and cherish as friends greatly and would do anything I can to save this great guild and the people who have made Val what he is. Thanks for listening and that is my cp for what it is worth, let me know if I can help I really do mean it.<br>

(I will be the first to say that, yes, I got 2 of my friends in to B.O. before they hit 20.  Atacand hit 20 shortly after he joined, and Aislynn is on her way.  I knew that Aislynn would be a good member since she has other characters above 30 on another server that I have played with.)  But I do agree with you Balky.<br>
<br>
The thing that I have noticed is that we had a big deal about setting those positions about a month ago, and nothing has seemed to come from it.  I know it's Summer and many people are busy with other things, myself included, so maybe it will perk up when some of us head back to college.  I have made Gira my primary now, I don't hardly play my Pally.  It may change so that I play my Jacobi more.  He (sort of recently) joined a guild on his server, but hasn't been around to play/group with them since I've been playing Gira.  Almost all of my friends are on Prexus - I only have 2 on Saryrn (Aislynn is one of them).  That's why I play Gira.<br>
<br>
I'd like to see Kakk schedule some raids since he's the War Master.  I'd like to see Tranitis and Baldrog be made emeritus positions (Questmaster Emeritus and Vaultmaster Emeritus - sort of like the old profs at college) since they have left the EQ world, but may come back.  Someone needs to fill these positions.<br>
<br>
Elupis, if you need any help keeping up the webpage - let me know.  I can help post announcements and the like.  I know a decent amount of HTML and am working on stylesheets.  All you'll have to do is let me know how to get access to the server that the files are on.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that Emanie will be back a little more often once school starts.  She was around during school a lot more than she is now (that I've noticed, at least).  Let's hope this is the same trend with others (including me).  You can probably expect to see me, Aislynn and Allerielle on around the same times because we're going to be roommates starting around August 20 and we'll have a cable modem.  Yay!  No more lame dialup!<br>
<br>
Ugh, back to the real world and my boring job.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I am willing to put in some effort in making this a good guild. <p><font face="verdana,arial">-Giradella Broomrider (Benevolent Order)<br>

<br>
Why is there a problem with adding low level characters?  Who cares if people want to start a 2ndary character and play them?  Are you concerned with guild image?  Are you concerned there is noone to group with?  Well if someone is playin there 2ndary that is in the guild...they will know via guildchat what the guild is up to and will be able to switch characters if they are needed.  Makes perfect sense to me.  Do you not talk on guildchat because there are so many &quot;newbies&quot; online that we insult your intelligence?  I don't understand.  Level really has no bearing on what you know about the game.  I have much more in game experience than my level suggests, not to mention an anal-retentive attention to detail thats more of a curse than a gift.  As for me..I can disband until I'm level 20 or whatever..I don't have a problem with it, just let me know.  I don't consider this post to be a personal attack...I just wanted some clarification.<br>
<br>
As for the other guild issues brought up in Balky's post...I don't really have a feel for them as I havn't been a member long enough to understand the political intricacies of this organization.<br>
