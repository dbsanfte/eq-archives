Hippolyte pushed back the long peacock patterned curtains from her door and stepped out of her hut.  She had been growing concerned for her two athelfi that had gone to investigate Gargarensia.  Hippolyte stood at her doorway and gazed off into the distant forests.  Her brown eyes almost seeming to try and pierce the thick foliage to see her missing athelfi.  She could only trust that Dawn and Sartha's great skills would get them safely home again.  <br>
Hipp wasn't sure how much Gargarensia might have changed or if it even had.  <br>

The distinct sound moved up the river, to Themiscrya. The assassin figured Hippolyte would be getting worried, and she only wanted to comfort her LaTra. After all they had one more thing to do.<br>
<br>
 Dropping down from the tree, Dawn nodded to Sartha, before slipping through the village. They'd probably meet back up at Darmus' hut.. that was their last stop before heading home. <p>

She raised a brow and took one step forward.  Then she stopped.  The small vasilissa knew it was a call home that they would be there soon and all was well.  She bit her bottom lip as she gazed into the distance.  Hipp would have to wait and be patient until the two warriors returned home.  She turned around and entered her hut....she would go tend to her weapons and mask...feeling it was needed. <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

She landed silently outside the doorway, looking down at her leathers, then inside at the dim candle light. She could hear the sounds of two people within, and she guessed the second person to be the woman who had been with the barbaric male in the tavern earlier. She growled lightly and put one eye to the crack in the door. A fine curtain separated Aragusius from the rest of the room and Sartha smiled chillingly. She entered with a deadly silence, dagger in her hand. She approached the curtain with a silent snarl upon her lips, one hand moving to pull back the curtain::<br>
<br>
::It happened in an instant though, even the amazon unprepared. She was not to find Aragusius behind the curtain. Her eyes widened in surprise. She turned swiftly, but it was already too late::<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Athelfi! Get to the village NOW!&lt;&lt; <br>
<br>
&quot;I knew you'd come, Sartha...&quot;<br>

::the next moment was darkness for her::  <p>~The old days are gone. You can't live in the past, and you can't wait for the future. Now is all we have. You do the other two, you waste your life...

She hadn't reached her destination, no, instead she had collasped in the middle of the GarGarensia Village for all to see as he sun rose high above. <br>
<br>
 The amazon, quickly grabbed the ground before standing, and glancing around, her eyes flashing back to their emeralds, as she took off into the village.<br>
<br>
 &quot;SARTHA!&quot;<br>

 Dawn wasn't about to leave her athelfi here.. not now.. not ever. They were bonded. <p>
