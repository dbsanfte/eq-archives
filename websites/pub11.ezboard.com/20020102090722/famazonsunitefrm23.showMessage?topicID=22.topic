&quot;I wholly agree with our brother Hermes, who appears to be wise beyond his years. You fools sit around arguing over who is the true god of love. Tis neither of you! Aphrodite, the fair, is the true divinity of love, for she encompasses all aspects of the word. Emotional, Physical, and Phsyciological. You two, are minor gods of &quot;love&quot;. You Cupid, spark desire. You Dionysus, spark carnal excitement. Neither of you encompass love in its entirty. So stop this foolish bickering! By your foolish arguing mortal die, not that I care if they die, but the death of mortals effect each and everyone of us in a different way. Keep in mind, our young brother Hermes must lead the dead to the Underworld. And in mortals dying, some of us lose supporters.&quot; he crosses his arms.<br>

&quot;I suggest you BOTH bite you tounge, and apologize to Aphrodite. You disgrace love itself by arguing over it! Love is to be cherished and shared, not fought over like a scrap of meat to wolf pups. I am ashamed of both of you, as I am sure alot of us are.&quot;<br>
