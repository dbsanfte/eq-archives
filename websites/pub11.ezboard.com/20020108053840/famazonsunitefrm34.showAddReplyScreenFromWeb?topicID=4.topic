She pets him and grabs her bow and arrows from the saddle, and turns to Gabrielle.~  Okay Gabrielle, get your stuff and let's go kill us some rabbits! ~she starts off into the forest, her bow strung and ready.~ <br>
<br>
 AnAthena4u143:  ::she gives Vel a humored look and dismounts,tying up Pandora to a tree with enough food and water near by.She took of her bow and quill of arrows and hurried off after her,being silent but swift so as not to scare away possible dinner::Right behind you... <br>
<br>
 CristalC15:  Okay, ~Var whispers back~ If you see a saber-toothed rabbit, shoot it quick. Those suckers are mean.~ She walks quietly further into the forest and spots a large boar drinking from a stream. She aims her arrow and shoots it, then quickly strings another arrow and shoots again, and the boar falls over.~  Mmm... I haven't had boar in a long time.. ~ She licks her lips and starts off toward the animal.~ <br>
<br>
 AnAthena4u143:  ::she nodded and let her get her kill,on the look out for any other larger animals that might have been hunting the boar as well as them.When she saw nothing,she went past Varia to the stream and looked into the icy fresh waters.What she saw brought a smile to her lips::Hey Var...how does &quot;trout 'de la boar&quot; for dinner sound to you?::she stripped off her boots and layed down her bow,wading into the icy waters,shivering just slightly::Here fishy fishy fishy...<br>
 <br>
 CristalC15:  ~Var laughs and stops beside the edge of the stream~ Trout 'de la boar'? ~she licks her lips again~ Sounds good to me! ~She gets to the boar and tries to pick it up but the thing is huge, and doesn't budge. So she tries another angle, and ends up with blood all over her arms and clothes and face, as the stupid thing won't give an inch. Finally frustrated she grabs its legs and pulls, and one of them pops off in her hand. She shrieks and drops the legs, and turns to Gabrielle.~ Hey, when you're done there <br>
 CristalC15:  would you mind giving me a hand? <br>
<br>
 AnAthena4u143:  ::she laughed and nodded::Sure...::she went very still and watched a trout swam towards her legs.She took a breath and plunged her hands in the icy waters and came up with the fish between her two hands,wriggling and twisting.She grinned and tossed it o shore,landing it on Var's feet.She waited and repeated the technique about five more times,each time landing them on Var's feet&gt;She smiled and got out,immediately putting on her boots and walking towards the heavy prey.::Ok you get that side,I'll take  <br>
 AnAthena4u143:  the head end...::she places her hands under the boar's armpits::<br>
 <br>
 CristalC15:  Great, ~she mutters~ I get the ass end that has no leg. ~she grabs onto the one leg and then slides her hand under the thing on the side with no leg, and lifts. Finally the blasted thing comes up off the ground, and she kicks the fish off of her feet and stands up straight.~ Thanks for the fish, by the way. Now I'm going to have to take another bath. ~She grins at Gabrielle, promising to get her back later for it.~ <br>
<br>
 AnAthena4u143:  You're quite welcome really...::lifts the heavy animal with her and they some how get it to a blanket near her bows,where she sets her end down::Put your end down,and we can walk with it on the blanket,as well as the fish...Much easier...<br>
 <br>
 CristalC15:  ~Var drops the ass of the boar and heads back for the fish and the severed leg. She grabs it up and dumps it all on the blanket, all except one fish, which she puts down Gabrielle's top.~ <br>
<br>
 AnAthena4u143:  ::her eyes widen and she shrieks,pulling the fish out of her top::You...are..so..dead... <br>
<br>
 CristalC15:  ~Var grins evilly and snarls~ You...started...it... ~she says, mocking Gabrielle's tone of voice. <br>
<br>
 AnAthena4u143:  ::glares and throws the severed leg at her stomach::So?:<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> icks up her end of the blanket::Come on,pick up your sister and let's get going...<br>
 <br>
 CristalC15:  ~Var pretends to study the boar's ass for a moment, then looks to Gabrielle thoughtfully.~ It looks more like your mother, but okay. ~she picks up her end and starts to move toward camp.~ <br>
<br>
 AnAthena4u143:  ::she laughs::That's actually a compliment....::she hefts the load onto her right shoulder,her left hand balancing it::Come on slowpoke...I'd like to eat before Solstice...<br>
 <br>
 CristalC15:  Keep it up and we'll be eating you for Solstice, ~Var grins and picks up the pace, trying to pull fast enough to make Gabrielle run to keep up.~ And why'd you pull its leg off, anyway? ~she smirks and moves even faster~ <br>
<br>
 AnAthena4u143:  ::Her legs wer much longer than Varia's,so she simply lengthened her stride,grinning::As I recall,it was your weak self that pulled it off,not me...<br>
 <br>
 CristalC15:  Weak? Heh. If I was weak the leg wouldn'tve come off then would it have? ~she grabs the leg and smears blood on Gabrielle's cheek~ Oh wow, I shouldn't have done that... red is SO not your color! ~she shrieks and starts to run back toward camp, getting sick of carrying the bloody boar.~ <br>
 CristalC15:  ((she's still carrying it though, she didn't drop it or anything)) <br>
<br>
 AnAthena4u143:  ::Her eyes flare and she twirls her fingers as she runs,and a lightening bolt zaps her in the butt just as they reach the camp,laughing and out of breath::Charred doesn't look good on you either...<br>
 <br>
 CristalC15:  ~Varia yelps as she bes zapped in the butt, and spins around to glare at Gabrielle. She drops the boar and turns back to Velaska, still covered in blood, and now with a fried-crispy ass.~  Hey Vel, good news! We caught a boar and some fish, so we're having Trout a la Boar for dinner! <br>
<br>
 AnAthena4u143:  ::laughs and looks around,spotting her horse where she had left her::Hey there girl...these ladies being nice to you?::she untied her and led her to the stream so she could drink freely.While she drank,Gabrielle took off her saddle and saddle pad,as well as the bridle and snapped on a lead rope.After she was done,she brought her back to near the fire and began brushing her,untying her mane and brushing it smooth::<br>
<br>
 CristalC15:  ~Var turns to Blade and untacks him, then lets him wander around to eat or drink or whatever he wants, knowing that he won't go too far from his mama.~ Good boy. ~She pets him as he wanders over to some fresh grass, and then she goes back and sits by the fire, and takes out the fish and one of her old daggers and starts to gut them.~ <br>
<br>
 AnAthena4u143:  ::Finishing up,she pats the horse and lets her wander,knowing she was like to run about with the other horses for the evening before settling in.Gabrielle took out a sword from many years back and,checking the blade,sliced through the stomach of the boar in a swift movement.Se cleanly slit down the middle,letting it's inards fall out as she began to gut it and clean it::Yum yum yum... <br>
<br>
 CristalC15:  ~Var looks up as she hears Gabrielle saying yum yum yum.~ Hey, that was fun. We'll have to go hunting again sometime.  ~She looks back to her task and cleans out all five fishes's insides, and takes out the bones, and begins to slice them and lays them in the pan over the fire to cook.~<br>
<br>
 AnAthena4u143:  ::she looked up at her,arching a brow::You must be quite sick if you think getting a fried ass is &quot;fun&quot;.Wait of course I forgot..you are sick...well that sorts outthe problem right there...::she smiled as she put the intestines into a seperate pan and started to prepare the boar for a large pit roast:: <br>
<br>
 CristalC15:  ~Var laughed and threw a handful of fish guts at Gabrielle.~ There you go. I just wanted to share some of my sick twistedness with you. Enjoy. ~she grinned wickedly and laid the last of the fish in the pan.~<br>

She could smell the coldness in the air and knew the bad weather would be upon them soon. However, she had the feeling that it would hold out until they made it to the fortress. She leaned against a tree and stood watch upon her amazons as the slept. In the morning. They would ride. * <p>Queen Velaska of Lesvos Island
