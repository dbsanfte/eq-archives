Standing, she walked to it and opened it, looking down, she smiled to Lukoi, her grey wolf who was back from his hunt. Lukoi jumped around happily as the Queen sat back down in  her chair, she motioned for her wolf to come to her, and he happily did. He jumped around wildly, knowing this meant he had news for her. DeL slumped to the floor and Lukoi sat before her on his haunches. His golden eyes stared deep within her seagreen ones. Showing her the image of Solari riding back into the city. Lukoi had quietly followed her all the way to her hut, which was kept in meticulious condition. Call it a hunch, but DeL felt Solari would one day return. As she watched what Lukoi had seen, a great big smile spread over her lips. But it was late and she figured Solari would need her rest. No need to bother the amazon this late at night, tomorrow would be another day.~<br>
~DeL jumped to her feet and rolled up her scrolls, it was late, very late, and she too needed sleep. Crawling into her bed, Lukoi jumped up and lay at the bottom by her fett, snuggling like a little boy.

She knew she would be facing many questions now that the village was awake...and she was ready to answer them. Solari held in her possession many an item from her travels in the lands outside the known amazon lands. She knows she has missed out on alot during her travels and will eventually be brought back up to speed on what has been happening with her fellow amazon sisters. Solari sits in her hut, going thru the many scrolls she has written and items she brought back in order to present to her old friend and queen, Hippolyte. Thoughts began to swim in her mind of how her old friend would re-act to her return, and of how her other sisters would be upon her silent return. Soon Solari would not have to wonder anymore, she dressed in her usual amazon attire, placed her sword on her back and gathered a small bag full of goodies for the queen, then stepped outside into the bright daylight and headed towards the queen's hut. ~ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uterrayus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Terrayus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#993300>(7/19/02 3:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=371.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A True Amazon</span><hr size=1> :: She stocks the Amazon who's return she had felt in the dead of night.

Wanting to know the borders were safe and all was well.  <br>
<br>
Hippolyte had already received word of Solari's return.  The guard had recognized the elder from her years in Themiscrya.  With respect, Marpe had went to let Hippolyte know.  And that the travel weary Solari had gone directly to her old hut.<br>
<br>
Hippolyte felt a warm and peaceful feeling at Solari's return.  The once Queen from the Caucaus Mountains had been an important part of Themiscrya from even when she ruled so far away.  Then the day the amazon moved to Themiscrya brought great pride to Hippolyte.<br>

 &quot; Del, a celebration does sound nice, it has been a long time since I was part of one. But you know I have never been one to attract attention to myself. Some of the new amazons, I dont think know who i am really. So, I really dont know what to do or what to say.&quot; <br>
~ Solari chuckled softly in her own way when she was uneasy or unsure of something. That was her way of dealing with things. Almost always serious, Solari kept herself in the shadows, but always quick to depense of troublemakers with words or with weapons. The older amazons knew how well she could fight and always liked her challenges and fair sportmanship. The days of old were gone, Solari really didnt have to prove herself anymore. She would welcome any questions that came her way.~<br>

 &quot;Ok, Del, you can throw a small celebration. I guess this means I have to dress up.&quot; And she giggled softly.<br>
~Solari grabbed her boots and headed for her hut. She needed to get a few things taken care of and wanted to take a long ride through the valley before the celebration. Solari changed into dryer clothes and mounted up on her horse and headed down a forest path towards the valley.~  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=solariwolf>solariwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#993300>(8/18/02 8:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=371.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> A quiet ride</span><hr size=1> ~Solari urged her mare into a canter and enjoyed the fresh air and wind in her face. She rode through the forest, down paths she hadnt been on since she left the villiage so long ago. She rode past the waterfall she used to frequent, towards her old cabin she had built for herself and her first love and the mother of her child. The cabin had long since burnt down, but the bare spot and some old founding posts still stood. <br>
 Solari pulled her mare up and just looked at the spot where she and her wife, DeianeiraW called home. Instantly she was flooded with memories of past times when she was happy and in love. That marriage brought two wonderful daughters into the amazon nation. Daughters she left with Terrayus when she left the village when her wife died. Solari had not been as happy as she was when she was with her love, but she did love. <br>
 She frowned slightly and turned her mare back towards the vlliage. Reminders of the past was something Solari didnt want to think about. She was home and her life was starting anew as it always seemed to do when she was back in Themiscrya. She was ready to settle down again, her family needed her and her heart had mended it wounds.~ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamazoncyane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>amazoncyane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#993300>(8/26/02 6:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=371.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A quiet ride</span><hr size=1> Wen Solari got back, Cyane met her as she dismounted &quot;Solari, I have heard many things about you.

She patted her horse for the nice ride as she watched the amazon before her speak. <br>
 &quot; Who are you and just what do you known about me?&quot; Solari didn't mean to sound harsh. But years of traveling had made her weary of strangers who knew her by name and didn't identify themselves, even if they were amazons. <br>
 She began to unsaddle her horse while the amazon explained herself. ~<br>

She placed the saddle on the post beside her horse, then turned to her.<br>
 &quot; Well Cyane.. I am a true amazon and know the ways very well....but if the others have their suspicions, then something must have been placed there to give them their doubts. Becoming an amazon isn't an easy task. They can be quite harsh in their judgements. Newcomers are at great risk for that. Sometimes they dont make the cut the first time around, sometimes they have to find another tribe willing to let them in....it's never easy when you are a amazon...&quot;<br>
 Solari finished brushing her horse, then sat down in the wooden chair by her hut. She let what she had said sink in a little before finishing her thought to the young Cyane.<br>
 &quot; I know not why the others are suspicious of you, I haven't been home long enough to get every detail of things. But my advice is to give it some time, be patient and accept whatever the answer is on wanting to become a member. Like i mentioned earlier...becoming an amazon isnt easy, and praying to the gods and goddesses, well, let's just say that sometimes they dont answer us in the way we like at times.&quot; <br>
 She looked at the amazon and took in a deep breath. She fiddled with the sole of her boot as she proped her leg up. <br>
 &quot;That is all I can offer to you at this time. Take it from someone who knows. Be patient and learn to accept what comes your way, whether you agree with it or not. &quot;<br>
