She sounded a little crazier than usual, but in the way that made her the appealing Goddess she was.<br>

&quot;Dionysus could never be the God that you are. By the way, I've been reading up on that love stuff we were talking about. Sounds interesting actually. I prefer lust myself but well, you know how commited that can be.&quot;<br>

May i have a word<br>
If you want what is truly yours then you should have gotten it quicker. Zeus gave me the power of many many things and sex is one of them. BUt you , you have Love you can make people fall in love something i can not do. So i would appreciate it very much..Nephew if you would talk to Ares about forgetting his armies. And if you have to say something talk to me not to my family. We can possible resolve this in a sharing of power which is something very adult to do.thank you my friend<br>
