(Let me make this clear. I am not trying to be rude to you both, or any of the others but it needs to be stated. If Alysia was to go onto the TOG board, she would be mortal because she was not in TOG Mythos. The Olympians Gods have almost the same situation in the Northern Lands. Yes, they have powers because they are reconized as Gods, but in Scynthia, Tanias Rivey valley, and a few other lands, the Ancients have more power than any. I have signed an alliance scroll between AotNL and TOG. I would hate to see that broken because of you. I am the moderator of this board, and I have the power to delete posts, if you attempt to make your &quot;God Powers&quot; try and attack my village, and my athelfi, your posts will be deleted and ignored. You want a war against the amazons? I'm fine with it, it brings an interesting SL. But know that the ancients are the Gods here, and you have no &quot;POWER&quot; over the amazons.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=hypnos>Hypnos </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 219<br> <font color=#993300>(11/8/01 5:51:35 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=C:\WINDOWS\Desktop\Stuff\hypnos.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Appearing</span><hr size=1> (If were so reconized as gods why don't we have the rights to use our powers? believe me, your ancients, are my counsins, there nothing more special then I am.)  <br>

I soooo need to kick my two cents in.  Okay, first of all.. for the AmazonMuns, it's OKAY to worship gods and goddesses, it's not like your amazon chars are going to be considered weak. Believe and worship and pray what you want. Happy days, mate.  Second of all.. Gods have powers wherever they are, no matter where, unless they're either in another universe or dead according to Mythos etc. though you may not follow it. Respect for some mythos is nice.  <br>
<br>
If you note in Hercules and Xena and whatever, those gods do have powers... look at Ares.  Yeah.. anyway, third of all [yes, I know I said TWO but it's obviously more] I must say that I find it pathetic that you all find a need to argue about this every single time. (I know that was a kinda lame example going to Herc and Xena when the TOG goes with absolute mythology only. Though it's kinda hard to peice together the X/H pics of chars with the straight mythos gods who were usually near nude or fully covered, but I get where you're coming from.[don't make that parantheses thing an issue here])<br>
<br>
AmazonMuns... you can choose to not to have your chars worship the gods, but since they are in an existence that surpasses the powers or strengths of MOST of your Amazonchars.. respect is nice and keeps PEACE-- which you all seem to desperately want.  <br>
<br>
GodMuns... yes.. we [formerly me] the muns tend to not like our territories poked and prodded and honestly, my char did show some respect to you all, since she herself was a goddess, though sometimes she would give a little huff and puff about them, since they were what she considered her &quot;annoying&quot; relations. I'm sure many amazonmuns and their chars are willing to show you some respect, but in the RP world... mortals and amazons etc. have the right to choose who and what they worship. So cut them some slack. Amazons are trying to prove that they can survive without the traditional weak-looking view of how a woman should be and saying they don't deserve to be thrown in the dark. Kinda like... one of the versions of Prometheus feeling that mankind deserves a chance..<br>
<br>
Hey.. just to let ya know.. I've got a new char... she's the Lydian Queen Omphale.. but she's six right now. You'll be seeing plenty of respect of her to the gods.. probably to Dite as well. Anywho... have fun with your posts..<br>
<br>
OH! And don't say you want a war unless you know the majority of those who are in the war realize that they can't give their mortal-type or limited power-type chars the infinite ability and power to enter and exit a war with no flaws and no cuts.  Also.. some people must be willing to bring in their chars and lose them, because if you have everyone live... then it sucks to have war also because every war has it's fatalities and I know a lot of people are attatched to their chars and don't want to give them up because they wanna do cool super-duper things with them.<br>

Catty, your opinion was greatly appreciated as well. PoseidonMUN, thank you for being polite and honoring my wishes. I will, however, explain myself for you.<br>
<br>
The Gods do have powers here of course, but don't expect them to have control over the amazons because most of the Scynthian amazons here are immortal themselves. Alysia herself is an Amazon Goddess, and an Ancient as well. In the Northern Beliefs, the Amazons come from Gaia, as daughters straight from the Goddess which means that they have powers as well. <br>
<br>
The Gods and Amazons are on the same playing feild here. The Gods' powers are matched. These are no women to recken with. As the Orio-Patan amazons were called the &quot;Man-Slayers&quot;, the Scynthian amazons were named so because in that language &quot;Scynthia&quot; meant &quot;Man-Eater&quot;. <br>
<br>
A war like this between Gods and Amazons would be like mortal against mortal, neither have the advantage other than their own personal skills. Hypos' actions will NOT be taken, the Amazons have their sleep. <br>
<br>
Just as the wars before this have progressed, each has say so to whether or not their character is harmed, affected, etc.<br>
<br>
I personally like the idea of the war between the Gods. As long as we can understand one another on this issue, it is fine with me. I do however have some requests:<br>
<br>
<br>
- Please take this off of the TOG board, I honor and respect the rules that Hera and Zeus have made. There was no war with the Northern Amazons against the Gods in TOG Mythos. Keep it that way.<br>
<br>
- Honor the doings of eachother, and accept that every character has powers in one way or another. Exagerating will not be accepted: IE - Hypnos can't bring insomnia to all the amazons. And to be fair, Alysia won't be bringing back any dead amazons from the Ancient Lands.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Each Character has their own abilities and strengths, please let's try to respect them. If your character has been cursed not to die, then by all means, don't get offended when someone tries to kill you. Just don't let it happen. Remember, we are the MUNS. We control this all. <br>
<br>
By the way, Poseidon and Eris MUNs, I wish to speak with you each individually. Please email me at: AmazonGlory@aol.com<br>
<br>
It actually invollves an upcomming SL I have been planning out for Alysia herself. <br>
<br>
Now, I wish to no further make this an argument, if you have something to say to one another, do it on your own time, no on my board. Any further arguments, accusations, etc made OOC between AmazonMUN and GodMUN, will be deleted without notice.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
Efharisto.<br>

Since we have kinda been trying to keep each Forum to it's own members so as not to confuse the heck out of everyone.  What about moving a "war" to the MO Forum.  That is a good place for guilds to blend stories together.  Now.. you must realize..that if you go in as a mortal to a story.. you are MORTAL.  If you are immortal.. PLEASE.. on your first post... state something to the fact.  EVER BETTER.. place it in your Ezboard profile.  Place ANY special abilities there if you are not a normal run of the mill God/dess from Myth.  <br>
But...also.. please note.. that around the first of the new year 2002 or maybe before.  The amazons will be asked to help out the Trojans to fight in the war for the Trojan War epic.  So, be ready for that.  <br>
Meanwhile...if you want to start a war..as I said.. you can go to the Mythical Odyssey Ezboard and start one.<br>
