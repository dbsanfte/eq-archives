She looks to him and smiles softly and kisses the back of his hand:: Excuse me my lord.....<br>
<br>
::Slowly and gracefully she rises from her throne. She snaps her fingers to her servant girl and the young girl runs off in another direction. Persephone walks to the stables in her violet, black, and white satin togas with silk on the inside of them, along with her royal amethyst crown. At the stables, her servant awaits her besides her two stallions, one as white as the snow, the other as black as the night itself.::<br>
<br>
Which one should I ride ? ::the bowing servant rises:: The white one your higness, it is much exceptional with your cloak ::Persephone nods and smiles softly:: you are right ::the servantwalks up behind her and draps a thick white satin cloak over her with cloud white wolf fur at its<br>
trims. Persephone ties the cloak and puts the hood over her head. The servant then helps her unto<br>
her horse and mounts the black one behind her:: <br>
<br>
Do you have the things I asked you for? ::the servant nods:: yes your highness. ::Persephone smiles slightly:: then let us be off ::With that, Persephone rides off out of a secret escape hatch with her servant following behind her. They ride through the dark dreary woods for about 15 minutes.::<br>
<br>
Your highness, it could be dangerous, have you told Hades where you would be going? <br>
<br>
::Persephone replies calmly:: No I have not, and whenever I come to this place from now on, I am telling no one I am coming here. I would like to come here alone, it is the one place I can  go alone without Hades' soldiers around me ::Ten minutes later, they arrive at the ruins of an ancient and somewhat small castle. They tie their horses up inside instead of outside:: I know that Hades men would see the horses if they come looking for us. Let us leave them here.<br>
<br>
::Persephone and the girl go further into the dark palace until they arrive in an old room, with the sunlight pouring in from the roof only upon a desk and chair. The whole entire room is covered with dust and a few spiderwebs. There, Persephone takes a seat. The servant then takes a paper and feather pen out of a black satchel and gives them to her. Persephone takes them, blows the dust off the desk, sits,  and begins to write.<br>
<br>
::&quot;Dear Mother,<br>
        It has been long since we have contacted you. How are things in the realm of the living? Other than being cold, fine I hope. I miss you so very much mother. I don't think I shall ever truly become accustomed to the Underworld, no matter how hard I try. I know Hades wants me to, and that makes me feel even worse. It won't be long until spring comes along, my stay is nearly half over. <br>
         It is much colder here than it is normally this time of year. I've run away from the palacefor a little while as of now. I'm in the ruins of some old castle. Its dark and dismal, but its private and no one would suspect that I am here.&quot;::<br>
<br>
::Persephone looks to the door quickly and silently, her servant looks at her:: M'lady? ::Persephone quickly puts a hand up:: Shh! ::silence sweeps throughout the room. She quicklyturns back to her letter::<br>
<br>
::&quot;Something now strikes me of this palace. I did not have this feeling last time I came here. I must leave this place now, an ill feeling is slowly shadowing my heart and me and my servant girl must leave now. I will write to you later after you have written back to me. I love you with<br>
all my heart.  Goodbye for now.<br>
<br>
                                                   Love, Persephone<br>
                                              Queen of the Underworld<br>
<br>
::Persephone folds up the letter and puts it in an envelope and seals it with the royal magical stamp she had taken from Hades' room. With that, the letter disappears and reappears in<br>
Demeter's lap herself. Persephone turns her head quickly at the door, not moving a muscle. She raises a finger to her servant to make sure she does not speak. A creaking sound is heard from another corridor at the end of the palace. Slowly, it gets louder and closer, even as it is far away::<br>
<br>
::Her servant looks at her:: Someone is coming... ::She gets up and follows Persephone to the door and they both look out in the same direction. Persephone shakes her head ::not someone...something ::A loud strange and angry shrieking sound is heard throughout the palace of something horrible and evil. Persephone's eyes widen a little:: Its a wraith! Run!<br>
::Persephone takes off towards the from the hall of the castle. Her servant tries to help her mount her horse. Persephone looks at her angrily:: <br>
        <br>
Get on your horse and go you fool! ::The servant girl nods quickly and gets unto her horse and gallops away. Persephone finally mounts and turns towards the other end to see a corpse like elderly male ghost gnarling at her. The ghost then gives its wild shriek and chases after her with horrifying speed. Its face stretching in mad rage. Persephone turns and gallops out of the palace, riding as fast as she can::<br>
<br>
Persephone looks back to see the wraith at the same distance behind her, this time flying after her, its hollow black eyes now glowing an evil glaring purple. Persephone looks ahead focusing on the road, her ebony stallion racing hard against the wind. After ten minutes she stops and turns towards the wraith. She takes a few seeds from her pocket that Demeter gave her and scatters them on the ground. The seeds crawl into the ground and huge grey roots sprout up like a wall on the road, binding the wraith.<br>
<br>
::Still, Persephone rides on hard towads Tartarus, a few minutes later, se can hear the wraith miles away in the distance tearing fiercely through the roots. She reaches the palace stables and puts her horse away quickly, she runs straight into the throne room and plops down on her throne breathingly heavily, despite the strange curious looks on Hade's and everyone else's faces:: <br>
