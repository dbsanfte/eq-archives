But the scroll she recieved from Hipp made her stomach turn.<br>
<br>
She walked to Hippolyte's hut and put a scroll upon the door, fastening it with her dagger. It read:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;font-family:courier;font-size:medium;">Hippolyte,<br>

De'Lerium</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
She walked back to her hut, put her wolf skin cape around her shoulders, tightening it. She picked up her mask, the mask of the Queen and ran her fingers over it. Her lip twitched as she put it on, but kept it up to keep her face seen.<br>
<br>
Turning on her heel, she walked out of the hut and over to the stables. It snowed earlier, and the fresh snow crunched beneath her boots. Her sea green eyes went up to the sky, then looked back around the land. She took her mare out from the stable and mounted the great beast. Then, without uttering a word to anyone, she headed to the clearing where she would wait for Hippolyte. <p><br>

When they arrived, Marpe nodded in respect to Hippolyte and then took off to her post to keep watch in the woods for Themiscrya.  And Hippolyte took off to the clearing.  There she saw in the distance, Solari riding quickly up to the side of De Lerium.  <br>
<br>
Hipp urged Monsoon into a trott towards the two Vasilissa's.  And then slowed down,  saluting them both in respect.  &quot;Greetings Vasillissa's!&quot;  She bowed her head and then lifted it up with a smile.  &quot;You did call me?&quot; <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

The cold air made her feel a bit better about what she was going to do. Maybe it wasn't in her fate or destiny. She gave a soft smile to Solari as she saw Hippolyte approach, she then slauted her. &quot;Thank you for comming Hipp.&quot; She shifted in her saddle. &quot;I thought long and hard about the letter you sent us, and I have come to but one conclusion.

&quot;I don't do this out of anger, or hatred, I do it because it is what has to be done. Maybe the Fates do not have it in my thread to be Vasilissa , right now anyway. You are the rightfull Vasilissa apo Themiscrya, and I wouldnt have it any other way.&quot;<br>

But, never one who wished to place her whole heart and soul into Themiscrya and the Nation.  In fact..you were there before the birth of my first child.  In your eyes... i saw myself.  And watched you change from the wild warrior without a care...to the one dedicated to the Nation..no matter what.&quot;<br>

Suddenly, she tossed the mask back to De 'Lerium.  &quot;That belongs to you.  Yes.. I have come back to Themiscrya.  But, fighting at my father's side..has shown me a wild world outside ours.  One that still is in chaos.   I need both you and Solari beside me.  NOT behind me...but beside me.  It is not a world..where one woman can lead.  We must become a triad...like the Goddesses we serve.  The Maid...the Mother..and the Crone.&quot;<br>

DeL....the young energtic virgin...her image melded with Artemis....then I saw Solari....the wise crone....and on her head.. I saw the helmet of Athena.  Then my heart stopped beating.  I heard the sound of my own cry ...when I was born.  And then the arms of Hera taking me.  The winds spun around my body...and suddenly...I was Hera..the mother.  Don't you both see?  It will take ever aspect of the Goddesses to bring back the Amazons in Themiscrya.&quot; <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>
