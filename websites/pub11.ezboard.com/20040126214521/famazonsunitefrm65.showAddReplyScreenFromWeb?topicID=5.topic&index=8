As she walked past one, she discreetly sent a fist into his right temple, knocking him out straight away. His friends stopped their teasing almost instantly. The young amazon looked back briefly and smiled at them.<br>
She nodded her thanks to Theseus and entered the room.  It was a nice enough place, not one that she would want to live in for an extended period of time, but nice none the less. She turned back to Theseus and smiled.<br>
&quot;I call the floor.&quot; She said innocently and stood still for a moment, unsure of what to do.<br>
Had she been in possession of her bag, she would have unpacked it, or done something with it. But seeing as she was standing there with nothing in her arms, she really had nothing to do.<br>
&quot;I must admit, I have never seen the Trojan Army in action. I have heard good things about them though.&quot; She said quickly. Her speech was always quick to cover for small errors that she often made when speaking the tongue. &quot;My husband saw them in battle once, he tells me they are quite brilliant at what they do.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theseusofthemiscrya>Theseus of Themiscrya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 95<br> <font color=#993300>(6/2/03 5:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm65.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/ixltheseuslxl/myhomepage/theseus1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just Following Along</span><hr size=1> Theseus tensed slightly again as he placed her bag up on the bed, &quot;No, you can have the bed and I will take the cot that folds out of that wall.  Noone has to sleep on the floor.&quot;  He was not sure that it was safe to be sharing quarters with a married woman.  He only hoped that her husband would be a reasonable man should he follow her to Troy.  He released her bags and stepped back slightly to give her room.  <br>
<br>
His mother had warned him countless times about things of this nature.  Should he piss off a jealous husband he was certain to be on his own and he was not looking forward to that experience anytime soon.  &quot;Perhaps I should leave you to your things.  You are probably quite tired after your journey and I should go tend to my business.&quot;  He ran his fingers through his hair nervously.  &quot;Just make yourself at home here.&quot;  He smiled slightly, keeping his eyes off of her.  She belonged to another and he was not about to violate those vows that she'd taken. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=battlingangel>Battling Angel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#993300>(6/2/03 8:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm65.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.speedis.org/images/214.png WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Just who is this girl?</span><hr size=1> Kalasin smiled widely when she noticed that he had tensed so much since her mention of Hiroshi Yamamoto. She closed her eyes for a moment and took a deep breathe. This happened far too often for her liking. She walked over to him and put a hand on his shoulder.<br>
<br>
&quot;Theseus, please, do you truly think that my husband is going to come after you for being a good friend to me?&quot; the young woman sighed, she did not want him to think that he would be in any trouble, he would not. &quot;My Greek is poor. In the tongue I am most fluent in, I would call him my zensha shujin. Husband of the before I think is pretty close to what you would say.&quot;<br>
<br>
She didn't want him to feel uncomfortable around her, the amazon woman got that too much already. Quickly, she turned to the back and emptied it out on the bed. Various nasty looking weapons fell out, along with some clothing. She shrugged, making sure that she still had everything, and then turned back to Theseus.<br>
<br>
&quot;You don't have to worry about him. We are no longer engaged in a formal wedlock. Also, he is a man with a wonderful temper. He couldn't hurt a fly if he tried.&quot;<br>
<br>
That wasn't completely true. She had seen what he could do if someone hurt her at all. But then again, since their meeting when she was only fourteen, eight years ago, that had only happened once. The amazon shifted uncomfortably in her travel dress. As she spoke, she rummaged through the few clothes that she had until she found a white chiton that reached the middle of her thigh. She smiled upon finding it, and without hesitation, pulled her current dress over her head, not ashamed of her nakedness, tossed it onto the bed, took the chiton, and put it on.<br>
The amazon, now comfortable, turned back to Theseus.<br>
<br>
&quot;Seriously, I only speak the truth. I don't want you to treat me any differently because I happen to have a man back in Hyrcania okay? I am not a different person. Just like you are not a different person because you were raised in Themisycra. You know what I mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
Finally, she sat down on the bed, frowning as she did so.<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually, I think I may sleep on the floor.&quot; she smiled sweetly. &quot;This bed is really quite nasty.&quot; When she noticed that he virtually refused to look at her, she sighed again, this time rather sadly. &quot;You can look at me you know. It is not a sin. You think my body is on display by accident?&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=battlingangel>Battling Angel</A> at: 6/2/03 8:27:37 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theseusofthemiscrya>Theseus of Themiscrya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 96<br> <font color=#993300>(6/2/03 9:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm65.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/ixltheseuslxl/myhomepage/theseus1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just who is this girl?</span><hr size=1> Theseus jaw dropped lightly when she changed unashamed in front of him.  It wasn't that he'd never seen a girl semi-nude before, on the contrary, he had, but never one like that.  He swallowed hard and walked as calmly as possible over to the wash basin.  He dipped his hands into the cool water and then splashed his face.  Not even bothering with a towel, the turned to her, &quot;I do not know why your body is on display.  It is not business of mine when you belong to another why you choose to dress as you do or behave as you do.  It is sacred, the vows you took.  I will not go against the laws and the blessings of Hera. There are certain bonds that should never be severed no matter what the temptation.&quot;<br>
<br>
He finally wiped his face of the excess water.  &quot;I am certain that your husband is a good man and a just man.  His trust and faith in you should not be tested.&quot;  He moved to gather a couple of items, trying to ignore the arsenal she had emptied out on the bed.  It was safer not to look at her.  His body betrayed his mind, reacting to her against his will.  He took a deep breath, &quot;I should go take care of my business now.  I will see you sometime after night fall.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=battlingangel>Battling Angel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 103<br> <font color=#993300>(6/2/03 11:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm65.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just who is this girl?</span><hr size=1> Kalasin frowned when she heard the name of the Greek goddess of marriage. Before he went she spoke.<br>
<br>
“You don’t get it do you?” she smiled at his back. “You assume too much. I will have you know that I never took any vow under Hera. I took a blood binding. As to the issue of my body, it is my heart and soul that belong to my lover. As for my loyalty, I never made a pass at you. Believe me, you would know if I did.”<br>
<br>
She was starting to get annoyed now. This man was judging her before he knew a thing about her. If he knew Hiroshi, he would understand everything, he was just proving himself ignorant to the ways of the world, and it saddened her.<br>
<br>
“Think about what I am. I am an amazon warrior with a husband and three children. I fight and kill for a living, and am an assassin by training. I am the head ambassador of Themisycra, the village you were born in. I was born a Roman noblewoman, and was a priestess for a time. You cannot define me, and please, do not try to judge me before you even know me.”<br>
<br>
Done, she sighed, knowing that in the end, she could not win. She would lose someone that would have been a friend to her just because she mentioned that she had a husband.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope the army accepts you. But I will mourn the loss of a friend, someone that decided what they would think of me based purely on my status and my body. It is a shame.&quot;<br>

However, regardless, I am in a very unbearable position.

She could not believe the sheer good nature that this person was showing her. Not many people took her words in the way that he had, and she respected him greatly for it.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know something? Your mother must be incredibly proud to have a son like you.&quot; she smiled, though somewhat sadly. &quot;You certainly have a lot more wisdom than most people that I have met. And even though I have stayed with men before, and never had a trouble, if you truly do think that you will damage a reputation, you can do as you wish.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kalasin was glad that she had met this man. He was a wonderful person, and it restored her faith somewhat in human nature.<br>
<br>
&quot;I still expect you to show me around the city at some stage though&quot; she grinned widely. &quot;Now go, join the Trojan Army, they'll be glad to have someone like you in their ranks.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theseusofthemiscrya>Theseus of Themiscrya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 98<br> <font color=#993300>(6/3/03 6:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm65.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/ixltheseuslxl/myhomepage/theseus1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just who is this girl?</span><hr size=1> Theseus shrugged lightly, &quot;I do not know how my mother feels about having a son like me; however, I believe like every good amazon, she would have preferred a daughter, one to follow in her footsteps and learn the amazon way.  But for some reason, Hera chose for her to have a son.&quot;  He opened the door to his room, thinking for a moment before he spoke again.  <br>
<br>
He cleared his throat and nodded towards the pack hanging on the wall.  &quot;There is some food in that pack.  Some cured meats and cheese.  A loaf of bread and even a loaf of nutbread.&quot;  He smiled slightly.  &quot;Please help yourself to the food.  I can get more, it's not a problem.&quot;  With that he pulled the door shut behind him giving her some privacy and time alone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=battlingangel>Battling Angel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 106<br> <font color=#993300>(6/3/03 9:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm65.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.speedis.org/images/214.png WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just who is this girl?</span><hr size=1> Kalasin frowned at the choice of foods that he had listed off. She was not hungry, then again, she rarely was. The amazon woman only ate when she had to.<br>
Right now, she felt like sleeping. According to her body, she had been travelling for nearly 4 days without a rest. It was high time that she actually got some. Without a sound, the amazon woman pulled the rought blanket off the bed and around her shoulder. She laid down on the floor at the foot of the bed, curled up, and dozed off for a while.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm65>Troy</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://pub163.ezboard.com/bmythicalodysseyforum">Home</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3m<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
