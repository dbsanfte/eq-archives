The young Amazon knows well the region's flora cause her adoptive mother, who is a Ti' Sa and healer taught her her knowledge when she was younger.When she found the plants she wanted, she takes her dagger, cut the stalk and places the plants in a basket.While she's gathering the plants, an unknown man suddenly come out of the bushes and jump on the young girl, who, concentrated on her duty didn't saw him coming.Daphnike seeing the knife he's brandishing stabs him right in the heart with her dagger and sees her attacker falling at the ground, realizing that she past close death.At that moment, an arrow, coming from farther, hits her chest and she falls, while pushing a wild cry of pain, protecting her precious plants.She cries before losing conciousness:*<br>
<br>
AAAAR-TE-MIS...MO-THER...<br>
<br>
*The Great Goddess, hearing the cry of the unfortunated Amazon comes at her rescue and takes her to the qasatour where the Amazons rescue their wounded sister,with tears in their eyes, while thanking Artemis for rescuing their athelfi.She's brought to Arta'Xi the greatest healer of the village, a great friend of her mother who removes the arrow and takes care of her wound.The Vasilissa Hippolyte is consternated by the gravity of the young girl's wound and asks herself who could have shot Daphnike so coldly and for why, keeping in her mind the rant of the proud and spirited young warrior who had no confidence in the Romans and entered in the Council Chamber like a fury when Ainia and Quinn wanted to give a Roman name to their child.Even Ainia stays at her side, even if she disliked Daphnike's brashness and isn't her best friend, asking herself if she seeked trouble by attacking the Romans.But when she learn that Daphnike was the victim of a murderor and shot coldly while gathering medicinal plants for her sick adoptive mother, tears begin to flow from her eyes and angryness fills her.Does that attempted murder have a connexion with the attempted murder of Vasilissa Maytha of Sarmatia?Does the man who shot Daphnike is one of those murderors who had the command to assassinate Amazons to avenge a powerful warlord killed by the Amazons...?*<br>
<br>
*Arta'Xi,while giving an herbal tea to Cyrena made with the plants Daphnike gathered for her tells her what happened to her adoptive daughter and say her:*<br>
<br>
She lost a lot of blood but fortunately, the arrow missed her heart.She's young and strong, a true warrior, she will recover.But if infection gets in her wound, there would be no more hope.Pray Artemis athelfi,I do everything in my possibility to save her but she's still in danger<br>
<br>
Cyrena: Who's the kilan who did that,if I find him, I don't pay much for his life!<br>
<br>
Arta'Xi: One of those murderors who took our people as their target.I don't know who is their commander.He could have a relation with the agressors of Vasilissa Maytha of Sarmatia.<br>
<br>
Cyrena: WHYYYYYYYY!Why ...I raised her since my athelfi died, saw her blossom and a bloodthirsty mercenary took her as target and she's now fighting for her life.Artemis where do you are!!!Bring me to her...<br>
<br>
* Cyrena and Arta'Xi come to the hut where Daphnike is lying, still uncouncious and Cyrena takes her daughter's hand while saying:*<br>
<br>
Parakalo Daphnike, dear kouri, if you hear me, please open your eyes,fight for your life, don't quit me...You're too young to die, you're beginning to live,Daphnike, parakalo zooi...<br>
<br>
* She caresses a long curl of her daughter's nearly black,waistlenght hair, tears flowing from her eyes as she sees her spirited and lively daughter fighting the Parques.Suddenly, Daphnike open her eyes and takes her mother's hand while saying*<br>
<br>
Mitera!<br>
<br>
* The Amazons know that their athelfi will survive*<br>

Suddenly she moves aside from the path of the door and in walks Hippolyte.  Her eyes filled with concern as she nods in respect to Cyrene and Arta'Xi.  So worried about the young amazon, Hippolyte does not speak...but moves to the other side of the bed that holds Daphnike.<br>

<img src=http://members.aol.com/queenhippolyte/hippcontemplatesqh.jpg></center><br>
"Daphnike, can you tell me.....," Hippolyte speaks softly.  Her brown eyes filled with the look of motherly care.  To her all the amazons where like her blood sisters or children.  "who did this to you?"<br>

<br>
I don't know...I didn't saw the archer...they were two* she takes a breathe then continues*I was gathering plants for my mitera when...a man jumped on me with a knife...I took my dagger and killed him...At that moment, an archer shot me...I didn't saw him...Who they were?...Why they attempted to murder me?...I don't know but they...they were well organized...* Weakened by her wound, the young Amazon falls on her bed, unable to tell more.Boiling of fever, she shouts in her delirium:* AAAAArtemis...save me from the vengeance of Krykus...<br>
<br>
*While Arta'Xi washes and covers Daphnike's wound of a medicinal ointment to fight the infection and accelerate healing,make a clean bandage and give her plants to combat the fever, Hippolyte tries to decipher Daphnike's words. Krykus...He was a warlord killed by the Amazons months ago...Could the young girl have been shot coldly to avenge him, shot only because she is an Amazon.She was probably picked as a random target, just because she was at the bad place at the bad moment, the assassin wanted to kill an Amazon, don't mattering her caste.Months ago,she travelled to Sarmatia where she learned that the Vasilissa Maytha had been the victim of an attempted murder to avenge the warlord Krykus.Did Daphnike's agressors could be from the same band of assassins.Hippolyte looks at Cyrena, fighting for her daughter's life, so worried for the young warrior that she don't find the words to tell to the unfortunate mother.Cyrena adopted Daphnike when her mother, Mytilene was killed by the Romans. Mytilene was Cyrena's bloodsister and a great warrior.For Cyrena, Daphnike is like her own child and her pride.Quinn looks at the young warrior as she's fighting for her life,don't knowing what to say her.Even if he's a Roman and know how much Daphnike hated his people, he has pity for her and regrets what his Nation did to the Amazons by the past, that his Nation made her an orphan.He knows that the best thing to do is to pardon her while hoping her recovery.He understands that she didn't hated him personally, but the Romans who attacked her qasatour and killed her mother.*<br>
<br>
* And the Tribe continues to hope their athelfi's recovery,while Daphnike is fighting the infection making her life in danger*<br>

<br>
Thanks to have fought so fiercely for my life, without you,I don't know if I would be alive.How I could prove you my gratitude for saving my life,I feel I will ever have a debt towards you.<br>
<br>
Arta'Xi: My greatest reward is to see you recovering Daphnike and I hope to see you passing through your initiation. Your mother could be proud of you and I'm sure that she's now a star, guardian of Artemis and that she protects you.You'll be a great warrior, like her.Cyrena told me that you handle the bow like Artemis, the sword like Ares and that you're as great horsewoman as our Vasilissa.I remember you when you were a child, you were challenging the other children of the village at staff fighting and defeating them all.I would like to see you challenging Hippolyte at horseback riding, just to see who is the greatest horsewoman of Themiskyra.<br>
<br>
Daphnike: Hippolyte is my Vasilissa and I don't want to challenge her in any way.<br>
<br>
Arta'Xi: I mean just a friendly challenge.You're a skillful warrior and horsewoman Daphnike, just as was your mother.She gave her life to protect Themiskyra, she was very loyal to Hippolyte.To rivalize with her skills isn't to be disloyal if you can put them at her protection and to protect your qasatour and athelfi.Themiscrya needs great warriors, you have the potential to be one.Don't be ashamed by your skills.<br>
<br>
Daphnike: To become a warrior is what I ever wanted to be.I don't seek glory and power, only to defend my Nation, Vasilissa ,Princess and athelfi with honor, loyalty and courage.All I wanted is to become recognized as an Amazon Warrior and to pass through my initiation that will make me recognized by the Tribe in a profession.I'm no more a child Arta'Xi, I'm ready to make my way<br>
<br>
Arta'Xi: Mytilene could be proud of you Daphnike.And your father also.I'm sure he took pleasure to see you growing as a warrior.<br>
<br>
Daphnike: My father!Who is he?<br>
<br>
Arta'Xi: Ares was madly in love with your mother.I'm the only witness of their frequentations, even Cyrena don't knows about the act that sent to your birth.<br>
<br>
Daphnike: Ares!<br>
<br>
Arta'Xi:I never told that to anybody before, your mother ever kept that secret.You're bloodsister with our Vasilissa.<br>
<br>
Daphnike( with temper): I can't be her bloodsister, Gods don't have blood, they're immortal.And I will never betray Gabrielle by declaring me as legitimous princess of the Tribe. She's Princess by law and I respect her.If your wish is to mount a conspiracy to make me princess, I would have prefered you to let me die.<br>
<br>
Arta'Xi: Daphnike...I don't ask you to challenge Gabrielle,just to take your place and to be worthy of your blood.You're a princess and half Goddess.<br>
<br>
Daphnike( with spirit): My mother wasn't of royal blood, she was a warrior of Vasilissa's Hippolyte guard.I'm not Princess by law.And the only Nation I'm loyal to is the one that is my self, the Amazon Nation.I'm an Amazon, not an half Goddess and I begin to dislike Ares! Don't be worried,I will be worthy of my condition and take the place that belongs to me, the caste that my mother belongs to.I respect the law and justice.<br>
<br>
Arta'Xi: Don't be angry Daphnike, oh, that fire temper is all your mother!You remember me so much Mytilene!I just tested you! And you're right in your choices.You proved me all I wanted you to prove me.You're true to your Amazon self, to yourself.Courageous and loyal like you,you'll make your way I'm sure to a place of honor.You're wise enough to know that honor don't comes from nobility and power from godship.You're daughter of Ares and Hippolyte's half-sister and that is true!But you are able to go higher than that position, by being at the same time loyal to your self, to the law and to your Nation.<br>
 <br>
<br>
* Cyrena, who listened to the conversation became even more proud of her daughter,even if she's not her biologic child.She loves her like her own child.Seeing that her daughter is now out of danger and recovering from her wound her eyes covers with tears of joy as well as Arta'Xi.But for Arta'Xi, it's both tears of joy and pride. Pride to have saved Daphnike's life.When she saw her uncounscious and bleeding heavily from an arrow wound near the heart, she was in despair and had nearly no hope she will survive.But she fought with determination to save the young girl's life and successed.Cyrena hugs Arta'Xi while saying her, tears flowing from her eyes:*<br>
<br>
Efkharisto athelfi, efkharisto...<br>
<br>
* Turning to Daphnike*<br>
<br>
I was so afraid, so afraid to lose you..dear kouri, my pride, my strenght, my ray of light...<br>
<br>
Daphnike: You'll never lose me dear mother.Arta'Xi, parakalo, could you seek Quinn and Ainia, I want to talk to them, to excuse me of my intrusion in the Council Chamber when they wanted to find a name for the baby.I listened to my impulses and forgot respect, for that I'm sorry.If they don't want to see me, I undestand but could you tell them that I'm sorry for that intrusion  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugoddessartemis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goddess Artemis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Goddess</span><br>  Posts: 83<br> <font color=#993300>(7/7/01 11:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=img WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Daphnike's recovery</span><hr size=1> ~ In a burst of green lights , with a soft wind, she appears, in her usual hunting garb, she walks over to Hippolyte with a soft smile~<br>

The queen was glad to know that Daphnike was healing fast.  Now, tho....the attacker was on Hipp's mind as she brushed the hide of one of her mares in the barn.  Her small but strong hand ran the wooden backed brush over the tawny hide.  Her eyes following the brush and watching as the hair was cleaned.  Hippolyte had always taken good care of her horses.  They were like her own kin to her, for it was a stallion who had announced her coming to this world. <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

<br>
She wears her leather breastplate and riding skirt, her horseback riding boots and hangs her long dark brown hair with a leather headband.At her neck, she wears her amulet, a necklace representing laurels she received when she was a young child.She ranges her sword at her belt, take her bow and arrows and her staff, ready for adventure.She prepares her horse for travelling then she go to say goodbye to her mother in the forest:*<br>
<br>
Cyrena: Daphnike...you're quitting us!Your wound isn't full cicatrized, it would be foolish to ride in your condition! Where are you going?<br>
<br>
Daphnike: If I'm able to walk,I'm able to ride.It's not the arrow of a bastard that will kill me.I'm recovered mother and ready to make my way.I'm no more a child, I love you mother, I love all my adelphi, my Vasilissa, my qasatour, if I quit you all, it's to pursue those murderors who spread terror to our Nation and kill them. After, Amazons could live in peace.I willn't live in terror mother.I'll found who's their chief and end their reign of terror.Everything that doesn't kill us make us stronger.Mother I'll return to Themiskyra as soon as I can, I promise* she quits the forest*<br>
<br>
Cyrena(crying): Daphnike...don't be reckless...they...they are dangerous...<br>
<br>
* But the young warrior is already gone* <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right
