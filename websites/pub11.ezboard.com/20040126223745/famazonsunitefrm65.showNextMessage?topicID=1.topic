The sleep that she had sworn she needed was in fact not needed at all. After half an hour of resting, she had been up and at it again.<br>
<br>
The amazon woman was wearing thick dark eye make-up and had her hair pulled up. On her neck there was a lather necklace with a ruby pendant that dangled just above her breasts. As for her top, she was wearing a string-bikini style top that didn't leave much to the imagination and an incredibly tiny skirt, both of red leather. Her boots reached her knees and were made of the same material. At her hip there sat a long, nasty-looking silver dagger. There was another strapped to her boot.<br>
<br>
As she walked confidently through the markets, she noted just how much attention she had gathered around her. It was not often that a fit, 6&quot;1' woman walked through the markets  of Troy clad in less than a common prostitute on her worst day.<br>
<br>
She wandered around from stall to stall, looking at the goods on offer...<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey beautiful. Fancy a good time?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kalasin spun around like a viper ready to strike to look at the person behind her. He was the same size as her, fat, and rather ugly. The Shatomlic Amazon looked directly into his eyes. In her rather shoddy Greek she replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;About as much as I fancy another hole in my head thank you very much.&quot; she retorted.<br>
<br>
There was one reason, and one reason only that Kalasin did not hack him to pieces then and there. She was on her very best behaviour in Troy, and didn't wish to cause too much of a stir. However, as the man ran a hand up her thigh, she doubted that there was very much in the world that could save him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Remove your hand from my leg. If you do not, I fear that you may well lose it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her tone was that of a teacher commanding a small child. However, he did not take it that way. He merely continued, this time placing his other hand on her left breast.<br>
That was enough.<br>
Quicker than anyone could have imagined, there was a dagger in his right shoulderblade. It had gone so deep that it had completly gone through the shoulder and had pinned him to the post. She smirked.<br>
<br>
&quot;See? I warned you.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theseusofthemiscrya>Theseus of Themiscrya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#993300>(6/4/03 4:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm65.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/ixltheseuslxl/myhomepage/theseus1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The City Markets...</span><hr size=1> Theseus had spent the day signing away his life to the Trojan army.  The excitement of being a part of something that would shape and mold him into a great warrior excited the boy to no end.  He was on cloud nine as he was ordered into active duty right off the bat.  It felt good to be needed and wanted for something other than who his parentage was.  He went through all of the routine of being issued equipment by the military and then was given assignments for the course of the next six weeks that would involve intense physical training and combat training.  <br>
<br>
But no amount of pain or anguish he would experience at the hands of the army's commander would diminish his enthusiasm and thirst for the knowledge and experience being a member of the army would give him.  So it was after receiving his stipend that he cruised through the vendors looking to buy some fruit and vegetables.  He took a couple of deep breaths not really finding what he was looking for when he heard a raucaus a few stalls away.  His eyes widened slightly, something told him that his new friend was in trouble.  He spun and pushed his way through the crowd to find the man pinned to a post.  He then realized exactly what pinned him to that post.  &quot;By the gods...&quot;  He took a deep breath and walked over.  &quot;Sir, I apologize for the reaction from my friend here.&quot;  He reached up, &quot;I'm going to simply retrieve her dagger and then we'll be on our way.&quot;  He had not seen what the man had done to Kalasin but no matter, he also knew that for a newcomer who liked to dress the way she dressed and who spoke with such an accent as hers, it would not take much to send the townspeople into a frenzy.  He gripped the handle of the dagger and took a deep breath, &quot;Okay, take a deep breath and then exhale.&quot;  As he gave the order for the man to exhale, he yanked the knife free from the man's shoulder.  He shook his head and quickly tore his shirt off, placing it over the man's wound.  &quot;Come, lie down and let me pour some fire water over the wound and dress it for you.&quot;  He'd at least learned something that may come in handy as a soldier.  He led the man to sit off to the side as the crowd seemed to start gathering.  He used his money to buy firewater and some bandages off of one of the vendors.  Then he did as he'd told the man he'd do.  He dressed the wound and did a fairly decent job of it too. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theseusofthemiscrya>Theseus of Themiscrya</A> at: 6/4/03 6:48 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=battlingangel>Battling Angel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 109<br> <font color=#993300>(6/4/03 11:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm65.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.speedis.org/images/214.png WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Apology</span><hr size=1> Kalasin watched with some interest as Theseus dressed the wound. She had not meant to do as much damage as she had, it was a reaction that she had built in from all of the years that she had spent living as she did. The amazon knelt down next to him, rather sorry for her loss of control. She put a long hand on the man’s knee.<br>
<br>
“I am sorry sir.” She said quietly, her face truly reflecting that she did regret her actions. “I tried to warn you… but you did not pay me any heed.”<br>
<br>
She knew that the man would not want to accept her excuses for what had happened, that was just the way that things were. She figured that Theseus would not be the least bit impressed by her behaviour, and that worried her too. She really was trying to be a good person, but it was getting harder and harder by the minute. There was that constant nagging in her head, jumping at up every missed opportunity. Every time Theseus left himself open, it started again, pointing out all the ways in which she could end his life in a moment. But she resisted. She always resisted.<br>
It was then that she turned to Theseus, her green eyes were very worried as she spoke.<br>
<br>
“I didn’t do too much damage did I?” her voice was also thick with concern before she turned back to the man, dragging quite a few gold coins from her purse and putting them in his hand firmly. “Here, this should easily cover any medical costs you may incur, along with at least a weeks food. It is all Roman coins.”<br>
<br>
Roman coins were worth a lot in places like Troy. If one had Roman coins, one could buy their freedom from the Romans for a time. It was moments like that in which Kalasin thanked Amaterasu for her good fortune.<br>

Then waited as the man walked away.  He turned to Kalasin, glancing at the dagger, &quot;We should go wash that up so you can put it back in it's rightful place without further incident.&quot;  He started to walk through the crowds, towards the washing well.  Coming from the small village of Potiedea, he was ignorant in the ways in which he was leaving himself open.  There he had not had to worry with that but even if he had why would he have to concern himself with that here in this place with Kalasin?  Yes, sure she was an assassin, but she was not an assassin sent to end his life, was she?  Hera had plans for him, big plans for him and she certainly would have warned him if someone had come to send him into the underworld.  <br>
<br>
Upon reaching the washing well, he settled against the stone structure.  &quot;Go ahead and wash up.&quot;  He nodded towards the water. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=battlingangel>Battling Angel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#993300>(6/5/03 7:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm65.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.speedis.org/images/214.png WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Apology</span><hr size=1> Kalasin nodded somewhat solemnly, certainly not the jovial person that she had been prior to this incident. It had confirmed everything that deep down she already knew. No matter where she went, who she was with… she would always be the same person, the same violent killer when push came to shove.<br>
The amazon woman pulled a bucket of water out of the well and quickly poured the clear liquid out over her weapon. She put it back in it's place after it was clean and then looked back up to Theseus.<br>
<br>
&quot;I didn't mean it.&quot; she said quietly. &quot;I tried to tell him…&quot;<br>
<br>
The amazon was used to pleading her case with people, and it showed. However, after a moment, she seemed to compose her somewhat sad look and smile smally.<br>
<br>
&quot;You joined the army then?&quot;<br>

Touching things that don't belong to them and what have you.&quot;  He glanced at her, &quot;I pretty much think he probably got what he deserved, but the last thing either of us need right now is to find ourselves thrown into jail for attacking an unarmed man.&quot;  He could tell that she was upset and he wanted to comfort her, but all he could do at this point was to caution her against further outrages.<br>
<br>
&quot;Next time you have a problem like that, please, find me before you react.&quot;  He knew that probably wouldn't happen, but he had to try to give her some other option then to ram a dagger into a man's shoulder or any other body part. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=battlingangel>Battling Angel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 112<br> <font color=#993300>(6/5/03 6:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm65.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.speedis.org/images/214.png WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Apology</span><hr size=1> Kalasin nodded slowly, taking her time, as always, to comprehend what he was saying. She did not like being as ignorant as she was to the Greek language. Shehad to listen very carefully, and then translate everything in her head into Latin. It was a royal pain. even worse was trying to figure out what to say back.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you.&quot; she smiled sweetly at him. &quot;You have no idea how often I have to explain myself. Gaol* is not a problem for me, most of them are simple to escape once you know what you are doing.&quot;<br>
<br>
The amazon woman looked nervous speaking to him, and she was, she really did not want to lose a friend because of some filthy man's inability to keep his hands to himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you think of the army anyway? Are they as decent as I have heard?&quot;<br>
