He was a mortal man, as i was, and you are. Your father, though, was something more than normal. He was a great warrior, one that will be missed by all who knew him. One day, you father grew ill. It was shortley after you were born. It got worse, never better. Within a month he died. I never spoke of it because it was too painful. I came here to tell you this because it is something that needed to be known. I shall tell you this last thing, for Hades becons me nack to the relm of the dead. Within a tenday, you shall be visited by your father. He will come at night. Do not fret. Remember my son. I shall always love you.&quot;<br>
