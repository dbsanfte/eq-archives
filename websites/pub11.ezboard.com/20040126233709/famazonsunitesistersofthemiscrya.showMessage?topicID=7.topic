The sun barely touches the top of the trees, the morning still a dark mist.  Hipp looks to the dusty grey heap where a small fire once burned.  She gets up and packs as much as she can..allowing Sethra a little more sleep.  She waters the horses and finishes tying the packs for the ride. She grabs two pieces of bread and cheese.

  Sethra double checks to make sure they have everything..... then they load the belongings back on their horses and take off. They ride awhile and the day gets brighter and hotter. A few clouds hang in the sky with no threat of rain. The wind blows lightly towards them and keeps them cool.

They could be a rowdy bunch at times but, Justine knew that they would behave if she asked.  She chuckled to herself imagining Quinne and Fhad bowing to the Queen, especially Fhad, her beloved husband. He was not used to nobility but Justine felt he could handle situations as they arose.  She stopped to watch Dabriel playing with her toes - exploring her new world. She chuckled as Dabriel tickled herself and let out peals of laughter.  Her daughter was precious to her and a gift from the gods.  <br>
Justine looked out the window peering off to the horizon to where Hipp and her entourage would appear.

She needed to buy some supplies for dinner at the marketplace.  Dabriel, her daughter, was strapped to her back.  Justine talked softly to her as they walked.  She pointed out trees and birds.  Justine knew that Dabby was too small to understand these things now.  She was not quite 5 months old but Justine liked talking to her and listening to Dabby's cooing back in reply.<br>
As Justine neared the docks, she noticed a small boat she had never seen before.  She wondered who came to Skye aboard it.  <br>
Justine continued onwards towards the marketplace and noticed a small crowd of sailors from a ship she knew was not Captain Merlobo's.  Their uniforms were not recognized by Justine.<br>
They seem to be surrounding two very tall women dressed in gard that was not from the Island.  Approaching nearer, Justine recognized the Queen.  She quickly ran to her, stepping between the women and the sailors.  Looking sternly at the men, she said.::<br>
&quot;Alright!  I'm Justine Ash Abdiel, leader of the Clan on this Island.  What seems to be going on here?  You men best get back to your ship. And I shall find your Captain and report this incident to him.  Now - get moving!&quot;<br>
::The sailors grumbled but recognized the name.  They moved off slowly and Justine turned her attention back to the Queen.::<br>
&quot;Your highness!  Welcome to Skye.  I am so glad you finally arrived and I must apologize for those sailors.  They shall be properly reprimanded I assure you.&quot;<br>
::Justine bowed her head respectfully to the Queen.::  &quot;The Inn has been prepared for you and your troops. If you would like to refresh yourself, please follow me.  I want to make you comfortable and allow you to change and rest.  Then, I can give you a tour of the Island.&quot;  ::Justine turned to the other woman.::  &quot;And welcome to you also.&quot;  ::She extended her hand to her.:: &quot;I am Justine. And you are .........?&quot;<br>
