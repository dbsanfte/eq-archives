&quot;Raven?&quot;, was the only word Yakut could process at this moment. She knew Raven was immortal but her maternal instinct still said 'Fire, not good.' Yakut wrapped her arm around Raven's shoulder, and pulled her into an embrace away from the flames. She did so quickly.<br>
<br>
Yakut didn't pretend to understand, but she tried her best to attempt to understand. Raven and herself had many differences, but many similarities as well. The Queen was confused often about what went on inside her eldest daughter. She had a psychic connection with all her kids, but something kept her from reading into Raven's feelings. Perhaps it was the darkness that Yakut feared, or perhaps it was Raven blocking it her ownself.... <p>-|-Queen Yakut-|-<br>

Yakut was right. Darkness was inside of Raven, and a great deal of it. But Raven too withdrew her thoughts from others. <br>
Raven's eyes remained on the fire, and as she sat there in Yakut's arms, completely emotionless on her face, she seemed almost that of a young child . . . begging to emerge. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">~*~ Jessica ~*~<br>

She wanted to say more, but held her tongue.  She had a special interest for this Amazon, that had oddly developed quickly.

She brought her hazel occulars to eye the guards as they nodded to her.  Amarice nodded in respect back, and entered.  Behind her was a beautiful gray horse, decorated with white spots on her back.  A white star laid between her two blue eyes, as a long white mane fell before it.  <br>
<br>
The young Amazon had come to pay her respects to the great shamaness who had aided her in the claiming of her soon-to-be lands.  She stood amongst a large crowd of Amazons who, to, wanted to see Yakut.  She released her mare's reigns, and her horse knew where to go without guidance.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yakut!  Yakut!&quot; She stepped towards the woman and noticed the great change in her appearance.  Her trademark smile of cynicism fell across her lips as sarcastic thoughts filled her head.

She charged and tackled the young Amazon down to the ground. She looked down at Amarice's face with a playful smile on her face.<br>
<br>
&quot;I maybe old, but I can still run with the young of them.&quot;, she chuckled and got to her feet. The Amazon stretched out her arm and helped Amarice to her feet.<br>

A loud grunt was forced from her lungs because of the impact, as she was slammed against the ground.  When the tackle was over, Amarice began to laugh.  But suddenly, she ended her laughter and brought her features into a glare upon Yakut.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ohh..you obviously don't get enough running.  You're heavy as a horse, you old hag!&quot;  She placed her pale, slinder fingers across Yakut's shoulders and attempted to push her off.<br>
<br>
When Yakut was to her feet and offered Amarice help, she had to show some kind of respect...so she took her hand.  When she was to her feet, Amarice brushed off some of the dirt that had managed to collect onto her leathers, and brought her hazel orbs back onto Yakut.<br>
<br>
&quot;Samos...well...it's empty.  It's slightly hard getting a tribe off, which I am sure you know.  I hope you'll be able to drop by again.&quot;<br>
<br>
She eyed Yakut down once more before she brought the shamaness into an embrace.  Amarice lowered her voice and this time as she whispered to Yakut, her voice was full of sincerety instead of sarcasm.<br>
<br>

Her auburn occulars caught a glimpse of the commotion between Yakut and Amarice, a giggled a bit at the two, but quickly returned her attention to Nye when she began to speak again.<br>

&quot;Oh, I wouldn't mind showing you around at all..What would you like to see, first?&quot; Her olive-colored face remained tilted to the side as she spoke. <p>_.·.Øtere, §hamaness of the N¤rth.·._<br>
