'Ladies I have to go, as much as I'd wish to stay and play with you. But I've got some island hopping to do and check up on the locals.'<br>
<br>
::He the gave each goddess a kiss on the cheek and turned to Aphrodite. He studied her for a moment amazed at her beauty.::<br>
<br>
'I'll be seeing you as well Aphrodite. I'd like for us to get together sometime and become acquainted.'<br>
<br>
::He winked at her and his documents appeared undet his armpit. These were plans for his trip. He waved to all the ladies and the air snapped like thunder and Poseidon was gone.::<br>

<br>
&quot;I hope I'm not interrupting anything, not that you would mind. Eris, darling I'm not being bratty, just because you can't get your own way with me doesnt' mean I'm bratty, and to be upset over me being sad about Dawn's death actually come to think of it has nothing to do with you&quot; Ares looks around the room and his eyes lie on Aphrodite.<br>
<br>
Walking around the room to her he notices Circe<br>
<br>
&quot;Circe, its a surprise to see you here, not casting any spells on us now are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
*she'd better not cast one on me*<br>
<br>
Reaching Aphrodite he picks up one of her hands and kisses the back of it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Charmed&quot;<br>
<br>
Releasing her hand he takes up a seat right next to her.<br>
<br>
&quot;So whats going on!&quot;<br>
