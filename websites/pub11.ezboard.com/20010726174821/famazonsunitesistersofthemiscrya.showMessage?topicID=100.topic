::And with that, Sartha feels the full extent of her wounds and leans over on Vela's back, holding her side before falling almost gracefully to the ground for loss of blood:: <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=tiger4157>Tiger4157</A> at: 12/16/00 2:54:10 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/usheyala.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sheyala</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#993300>(12/16/00 3:55:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  ··~§*·Centaur War·*§~··     The Western Forest</span><hr size=1> ::Shey brought Jet to the healers and rushed back into the forest just in time to see Sartha use her magic, and fall off of her horse.  With the realization of the war end, and Hippolyte's death Shey raced on to save her friend, but was stopped by two centaur that dared not flee::<br>
<br>
&quot;You are outnumbered live whilst you...&quot;<br>
<br>
::Shey stopped midsentence as she looked upon the two centaur that stood there...A memory so sharp ran through her head, that Shey almost fell of Anya.  She remembered these two....  The memory flashed on as she saw them brutally murder her king and Queen::<br>
<br>
&quot;No!&quot;<br>
<br>
::It was like living the nightmare all over again, and she stood unable to do a thing but watchh them die.  Shey finally recovered and turned to the thwo centaur.  her eyes blazed an unnatrual purple, the centaur smirked in recognition::<br>
<br>
&quot;So the little witch has returned to watch another fall before her, look upon this wretched washed up bitch, she cannot even save herself let alone leaders or friends, how pathetic!  Well General..oops i mean ex-general  it seems you have failed in your duty once again&quot;<br>
<br>
::the centaur sneered and drew their swords.  Shey frowned ignoring their comments.  Her krimped hair flew back from her face in an unnatural wind, and the trees shook with disdain Shey dismounted and sttod to face them::<br>
<br>
&quot;Well boys it seems this old dog has learned some new tricks! Now have at you!!! and may Hadies be at ease on your souls!!&quot;<br>
<br>
::an arrow of light appeared in her hand, and the centaurs chuckled once more::<br>
<br>
&quot;Just try&quot;<br>
<br>
:<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ne said to her in a mocking gesture.  Shey merely but looked and the arrow flew from her hand into the centaurs chest, the other one reared and tried to run, but was frozen in place::<br>
<br>
&quot;That was for my King!&quot;<br>
<br>
::The one that was hit fell in screams no mortal creature could make and the second began to sweat.  Shey fed on his fear and formed another arrow.  She threw it, and it sliced the centaur almost in half, but her powers kept it painfully alive::<br>
<br>
&quot;That was for both of my queens&quot;<br>
<br>
::Shey smiles with malice and drew her rune blade, she kissed it, as was her old country's tradition and she raised it's magicked blade::<br>
<br>
&quot;And this is for me!! Long live Aerialla and Themiscrya!!&quot;<br>
<br>
:::she brought the blade down and stopped at the centaurs nose, smiling with evil malice she brought back her hand then rammed the blade into the centaur's heart, the beast dropped dead and she stood back, walking back over to Anya who was chomping on another centaur who tried to flee, smiling the wold turned and said &quot;This one is for Nago&quot;<br>
and with that the centaur died at the mercy of Anya's jaws.  Shey mounted her friend and ran to see if Sar was okay.  She found Sartha buried among bodies of horses and centaurs, Shey went to pick her up, but Sar opened her eyes shaking violently Shey frowned and held her dear friend close, knowing she was baout to lose another::: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=tiger4157>Tiger4157</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#993300>(12/16/00 4:05:36 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  ··~§*·Centaur War·*§~··     The Western Forest</span><hr size=1> ::Sar looked up at her friend with a slight smile, her body trembling from the loss of blood and power. She had used far too much in destroying the centaurs and it would now cost her. But the cost was not high, for it meant freedom as well. Freedom from a world that had cost her so much pain and anguish. She brought a hand up to Shey's face and put her palm on her cheek::<br>
<br>
&quot;Dear Sheyala, fight until there is nothing left to fight for. Don't let them get away. Avenge Hipp and now Alysia, for she is gone as well. Don't let them die in vain. I tried... Gods help me, I did, but I can do no more. This body of mine, immortal as it is, can still die. And I know it shall in but a moment. And so I say to you to leave me here where I belong. I am a warrior and I shall die on the battle field as my Amazonian Mother, KaraThea did, as my Queen, Hippolyte, did, and as my friend, Alysia, did. And when I have died, find Donovan and tell him to keep my locket. Tell him I'm sorry for what I have caused him. I truely did try. But at least I could see this day... when the Amazons... finally rid themselves... of the Centaurs&quot;<br>
<br>
::Her breath grew short and she smiled slightly before her breathing stopped and her head fell to the side, golden-brown strands falling over her face, her silvery-golden eyes closing for one last time. And then she was gone and her spirit fled to go run. A white tiger joined the Horse and the Wolf as they danced through the forest, and the tiger was happy:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/usheyala.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sheyala</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#993300>(12/16/00 4:18:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  ··~§*·Centaur War·*§~··     The Western Forest</span><hr size=1> ::tears flowed down Shey's pale face as she closed Sartha's eyes.  <br>
&quot;Herete my friend and may Hades be gentle with you::smiles:: if not tell him I will be seeing him soon.&quot;<br>
<br>
::Carefully Shey put Sar's sword on her chest and crossed her arms. Shey unsheathed her dagger and sliced the small braid that hung always by her right ear, 'twas a sign of hope among her people that was never cut unles that person died...and in a way Shey's sould had died that day..It seemed all that remaind was an empty shell.  She finished up by wrapping Sar in a blanket, promising she would be back.  Shey turned away from the ghastly sight and mounted Anya once again, she gripped the wolf's fur and wiped the tears from her eyes, even though her past was avenged, she had lost one that was very precious to her. She ran back to the fields:<br>
<br>
&quot;Sartha what ever will I do without you?&quot;<br>
<br>
::Shey sighed and kicked Anya to a run, she would chase the fleeing centaur to hellas if need be::<br>
<br>
&quot;Why art thou so cruel?&quot;<br>
<br>
::she asked of the gods as she rode along.  She slowly unsheathed her sword and held it out as she approached a group of centaur.  Finally with some resolve she managed to slay the whole group of ten, half with her sword and half with her magic.  Finally her aura slowed and her eyes turned back to their normal green.  Exhausted Shey stopped chasing and turned Anya towards Themiscrya village, she had some unfinished business there....Her last farewell to the world, she slowly went back to the feild, picked up Sartha's lifeless body and turned homeward::: <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/usheyala.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sheyala</A> at: 12/16/00 4:20:44 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessage?topicID=69.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessage?topicID=101.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.emailToFriend?topicID=100.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.threadControl?topicID=100.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=100.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=100.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm28">Amazon Sisters of Cremni<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya>Sisters of Themiscrya</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
