IF YOU EVEN THINK I WOULD ALLOW YOU TO HARM THIS TRIBE, YOU EVEN CRAZIER THEN I FIRST THOUGHT. No ownder you and Ares make such a good pair..your bother infintile. If you have a problem with Dawn, you take it up with her, not with Hippolyte. The Themiscryans have been though enough without having to deal with you Eris.~ points her finger at her~ I am the Protectress of the Amazons and I am sure you do not wish to deal with not only me, But Hera and Athena. If you do one thing..ONE THING to any of the Themiscryians....~regains her composier~ There will be tartarus to pay....You've learned long ago Eris not to cross me, look what happend last time, and remember what Ive done to you as payment....Dont make me do it again...<br>
