So when Cinyras, the king of Cyprus,boasted that his daughter Smyrna was more beautiful then Aphrodite herself, this braggadocio could not go unpunished. The goddess made Smyrna fall in love with her own father. One night, she climbed into his bed, where Cinyras-oblivious with drink-impregnated her.<br>
<br>
When Cinyras discovered what he had done, he chased his daughter out of the palace at swordpoint. Aphrodite transformed Smyrna into a myrrh tree just as Cinyras overtook her and split her in half. The infant Adonis emerged from the cleft. Repentant Aphrodite loved the infant, which she his in a chest and gave to Persephone, Queen of the Underworld, for safekeeping.<br>
<br>
Not unlike Pandora, Persephone grew curious about the contents of the chest. When she peeked inside and saw the stunningly beautiful baby, Persephone too beame enamored. She reared Adonis in the palace of Hades. When Aphrodite finally showed up to claim the child, Persephone, infatuated with teh boy, refused to give him up.<br>
<br>
Zeus put the dispute up to the Muse Calliope to decide. Calliope ruled that Adonis should spend four months of each year with Persephone, four months with Aphrodite, and four months on his own.<br>
<br>
Aphrodite was not pleased with this ruling, so she used her magic girdle to bewitch Adonis. The beautiful boy soon gave the goddess not only his own four months, but the four months slatted to spend with Persephone as well.<br>
<br>
Persephone was not pleased either. She went to Ares and roused his jealousy of this lovely mortal. So Ares changed himself into a wild boar and gored the boy, who was hunting on Mount Lebanon, to death. The blood of Adonis yielded beautiful anemones. But the soul traveled to the Underworld, Persephones relm and stayed with her forever. <p>Goddess Artemis

These were teh children of Leto, the beautiful daughter of the original Titan Coeus and Phoebe. Hera was tourmented with jealousy of Leto. So the Queen of the gods sent a serpent after Leto to vex her and to prevent her from finding a place to deliver her babies.<br>
<br>
Leto frantically went from place to place but found no welcome anywhere, since every one feared incurring the wrath of Hera. She finally found refuge on Ortygia, the island of her sister Asteria, where she gave birth to Artemis.<br>
<br>
Immediatly after her own birth, the newborn Artemis precociously helped her mother through nine days of labor and delivery until her brother Apollo emerged. Themis, Leto's aunt, took care of the young goddess and god, and nourished them on ambrosia and nectar-the food and drink of the gods.<br>
<br>
Artemis and Apollo cherished there mother, who had gone through such an ordeal to bring them into the world. Not long after there birth, the giant Tityus attempted to rape Leto in a sacred grove near Delphi. Leto called out the names of her children, who quickly resuced her by showering arrows upon the giant, killing him instantly.For Tityus's offense, Zeus consigned the giant ( who was his own son ) to eternal torment in the Underworld: The giants body was nailed to the ground of Tartarus, where it covered nine acres. Every day an eagle arrived to gnaw on his liver, which grew back with each new moon.<br>
<br>
Artemis and Apollo also defended there mother's honor when Niobe, teh daughter of Tantalus, boasted of having more and better children then Leto. The two killed most or all of Niobe's children, leaving her to weep eternally.<br>
<br>
Artemis and Apollo remained close to each other forever. Both siblings would become associated with the skill of archery, and they enjoyed hunting together. In addition, both had the power to send plagues upon mortals. <p>Goddess Artemis
Protector of the Amazons

She and her brother also became the protectors of young children.<br>
<br>
When Artemis was just three, she was asked by Zeus, to name any gifts that she wanted. Amoung many others, she named:<br>
<br>
A bow and arrow ( just like her brothers )<br>
<br>
All the worlds mountains ( as her home and playground )<br>
<br>
Just one city ( for she wanted to live in the mountains )<br>
<br>
Eternal Virginity<br>
<br>
Zeus gladly provided her with everything she wanted and more. He ordered teh Cyclopes to forge a silver bow and fill a quiver with arrows for her. He promised her eternal virginity. Zeus gave her all the mountains as her domain. And he presented her with 30 cities- and named her guardian of the world's roads and harbors.<br>
<br>
Artemis, constntly attended by nymphs, could almost always be found in the mountains she loved. Though she was the guardian of wild animals, Artemis enjoyed nothing more then hunting. Orion, a giant hunter, joined both Artemis and her mother on many of their hunts.<br>
<br>
Like most Olympians, Artemis reacted strongly whenever she did not recieve the honors due to her as a goddess. After Apollo had helped Admetus win Alcestis as his bride, for instance, the groom neglected to sacrifice to Artemis at his wedding. Image the horror that night when he found the bridal bedchamber teeming with snakes! Admetus quickly followed Apollo's advice and made the necessary sacrifices to the god's sister.<br>
<br>
King Oeneus of Calydon similarly offended Artemis by forgetting to dedicate his first fruits of the harvest to her one season. Artemis sent a monstrous boar to ravage and terrorize his kingdom. To rid the kingdom of this vicious beast, Oeneus was forced to call on some of the greatest hero's of the age to participate in the hunt.<br>
<br>
Actaeon, the son of Autonoe and grandson of Cadmus, offended the goddess by stumbling across her once while bathing in the woods. Furious that a mortal had seen her naked, Artemis transformed the hunter into a stag. His own hounds then ripped him to pieces.<br>
<br>
The biggest penalty paid for offending the goddess was that of King Agamemnon of Mycenae, who foolishly boasted that his hunting prowess outstripped even hers. On the eve of the Trojen War, Artemis stranded the Greek fleet with ill winds. To appease her, Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter Iphigenia-though, according to some accounts, the goddess showed mercy at the last minute and substituted a deer on the alter.<br>
<br>
Having won the right to eternal viginity from her father. Artemis sometimes found it necessary to fiercly defend it. Buphagus, son of the Titan Iapetus, once tried to rape her, but she shot him and killed him. The twin son's of Poseidon, Otus and Ephialtes, also met their doom trying to violate the goddess-and Hera as well.. Otus chased after Artemis while Ephialtes pursued Hera. But suddenly a deer- either Artemis herself after transformation or a real deer sent by brother Apollo- darted between the two brothers. Distracted, the brothers quickly hurled their spears at it, but it sped away. Otus's spear pierced Ephialtes, and Ephialtes's hit Otus- and both giants died instantly.<br>
<br>
Artemis required the nymphs who attended her to remain virgin's, just as she did. But her father once raped Callisto, a favorite of Artemis's. Hoping to help her escape Hera's notice, Zeus transformed her into a bear. But Hera- not fooled at all- tricked Artemis into shooting and killing the bear. <p>Goddess Artemis

The god of archery- as well as music, prophecy, healing, and youth- got an early  start on his art. Apollo was just four days old when he demanded a bow and arrow like his sisters, which Hephestus created for him. He immediatly sent out in pursuit of the serpant that Hera had sent to tourment his mother Leto. The serpant, Python, sought refuge at Delphi. But Apollo heedlessly followed Python into the shrine of the Oracle of Mother Earth and killed him there.<br>
<br>
Gaia was of course outraged at this defilment at her shrine. Yet after Apollo was purified for his crime in Crete, he learned the art of prophecy-perhaps from Pan- the goatlegged god of flocks and heards. In any case, he soon took over the Oracle at Delphi. Through the Oracle of Apollo ( its name was changed ) , the god became so  closly associated with  art of prophecy that almost all seers soon claimed to have either been taught or fathered by him.<br>
<br>
Originially a herdsman, Apollo was the first god charged with protecting flocks and heards. (Pan was associated primarily with goats and sheep that grazed in rural and wild areas; Apollo-and later Hermes- more with cattle that grazed in fields on the outskirts of the city . )  But he later turned these duties over to Hermes for exchange of some musical instraments the younger god had devised. Apollo demonstrated such talant as a musician that he soon became the god of that art too. Some even created him with having invented the cithara <  A musical instrament that resembles the lyre. ><br>
<br>
Some dared to challege Apollo's musical talents- but never more then once. A satyr named Marsyas once found a flute made from the bones of a stag. ( Athena had made this flute but had thrown it away when the other immortals laughed at her when she puffed her cheeks to play it. ) Still inspired by Athena, the flute played rapturous music. Listeners even compared the Satyr's playing favorable to Apollo's playing of the lyre.<br>
<br>
This comparison enraged Apollo, who immediatly challenged Marsyas toa  contest. The contestants agreed that the winner could choose any type of punishments for the loser. The jury of muses found both players magnificant. So Apollo dared teh satyr to try to do what he himself, could do: turn his instrament upside down and play it-and sing while playing it. Marsyas, of course, could do neither witha flute.<br>
<br>
Impressed by his versatility, the muses judged Apollo the best musician. Not content with merely winning, Apollo then chose a brutal punishment for Marsyas: He skinned the satyr alive and nailed his skin to a pine tree.<br>
<br>
<br>
Apollo never married, but he was by no means celibate. He fathered more then a dozen children by atleast nine different partners.<br>
<br>
Yet his most persistant courtship- that of Daphne, a mountain nymph-was never rewarded. Apollo first eliminated the competition. Leucippus, the son of King Oenomaus of Pisa, also loved Daphne-so much that he once disguised himself as a girl just to be with her while she  engaged in her mountain romps with other nymphs. But Apollo knew of this charde that he advised the nymphs to bath nakid. When Leuippus was exposed-literally and figurativly-the nymphs tore him to shreds...<br>
