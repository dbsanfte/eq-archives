By some glorified act of the Fates he managed to summon up enough will to land on his feet. Whatever it was, it hurt! Apollo's eyes narrowed as a increasingly aggressive growl escaped his lips. He turned around slowly, his eyes bouncing around looking for his attacker. Whoever it was, it had to be of divine strength, for that was no normal &quot;spear&quot;.<br>
<br>
His azure eyes locked onto that of Hypnos, Lord of Sleep. Apollo's fists curled in anger as he desperately wanted to wipe that obnoxious smirk off of his face. These people didn't seem to realize that only two people in the cosmos could pull of that kind of obnoxiousness and make it look good. Himself, and Aphrodite. Not Hypnos, not Poseidon, not anyone else. But they insisted on insulting his eyes.<br>
<br>
Apollo then realized who had attacked him. The whimsical god of dreams, Hypnos, this was Hypnos of Zeus's sake. A loud thundering bellow of a laugh escaped Apollo as he almost doubled over with laughter.<br>
<br>
&quot;You?&quot; his laughter pause as he then pointed to Hypnos.<br>
<br>
&quot;Moi?&quot; he then pointed to himself. Again the air filled with the musical cackling of Apollo.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hypnos of dreams, the flea-footed God of Sleep. You come forth to me, blind to all facts, ignorant to all actions and attack haphazardly. You think not of your action. Act, then think. The thought process of yours, is backwards. You should think. Then act. For the opprobrious outburst you just made has angered me. For this you are a fool, to say the very least. And I think I will say the very least, for I do not want to waste any time in the disposal of you. The sooner, the better.&quot;<br>
<br>
Apollo's hand outstretched in front of him. Light concentrated within his palm, and as if by Hecate's magic appeared his golden hilted sword. Again, as if by magic of Hecate, Sorceress Nurse of the Young, Apollo was outfitted in his golden battle armor. His cape whipped around in the night wind. His eyes narrowed upon Hypnos. Everything else seemed to fade off into the background. The very world around him grew opaque, only Hypnos was illuminate in the night.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now Hypnos. Before I beat some sense into you I wish to give you time to take in the realization of what you have just done. You have ten seconds.&quot; Apollo smiled mockingly at Hypnos. Had he forgotten there were other stronger than him, or had commanding a weakling army gotten to him?<br>
<br>
Apollo's body fell into battle position. His arm outstretched as his hand made the &quot;come hither&quot; gesture. A smirk rode its way onto his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's dance.&quot; <p>      *~*The Golden God*~*

She limped back down under the tree, and then whistled for her horse. Her horse comes galloping to her. Maytha pulls off her bag from her horse. She pulls out a needle and thread. She tears off her bandage, and starts to sow up her wound in her leg. She sows up fast...then rebandaged her leg. She puts a minor pressure point on her leg so the pain is less. She stands up and hops on her horse. Rides down the path, sword in her back and bow and arrows in hand. As she goes down, she pulls out her sword and slashes solders left from right as she goes on. Just then, she sees Alysia fighting posiden. she stops her horse, puts her sword on her back, and puts an arrow in her bow. She pulls the string back and shoots the arrow at posiden. It hits his chest, but hes a god, so not effect, just saves some time for Alysia. Maytha then gallops down and sees Fogstone and Dawn fighting. For Dawns protection, Maytha stops her horse. Places an arrow in her bow, and shoots and hits Fogstone in the chest. She hops off Her horse, pulls out her sword. A couple of solders come and attack Maytha, Maytha stays near by Dawn, just in case of help. Maytha blocks off a solders sword and stabs him in the stomach. Pulls out her sword and just fights off more solders....keeps an eye on fogstone....as she fights.<br>

His little &quot;Dream balls&quot; did little to harm him. All they did was make a large noise, and cause little pain. Azure orbs jumped from one annoying figure to the other, all the same. Or were they? Hypnos was famous for his little illusionary tricks, and Apollo was not about to fall victim.<br>
<br>
He pulled a single arrow from his golden quiver and placed it into the bow. He closed his left eye and whispered the chant he uttered with the release of ever arrow:<br>
<br>
&quot;Shoot far, Shoot true.&quot;<br>
<br>
And with that the golden dart flew into one image of Hypnos. When it struck the imagine disippated into a cloud of purple and blue smoke. A smirk found its way onto Apollo's face as he leered over to another image of the sleepy god. This time he pulled three arrows from his quiver and arranged them on his bow so that he may shoot them at different times, without having to go back into his quiver.<br>
<br>
&quot;Eenie.&quot; he shot, and the figure erupted with smoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;Meenie.&quot; The ground was growing thick with the dense swirling fog.<br>
<br>
&quot;Minie.&quot;And another turned into smoke.<br>
<br>
Apollo pulled another two arrows from his quiver and aimed them perpendicular within the bow, aimed at two figures of Hypnos. Closing his eye and mouthing his chant he let the fly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Moe.&quot; he said, as the two figures dispelled from around the original Hypnos.<br>
<br>
Apollo found himself smiling, it was a rather ingenius plan if he did say so himself. His bow and quiver soon vanished in a fluster of golden light. And in his hand appeared his sword.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your little reindeer games fail to impress me Hypnos. That little show was a childish waste of my time. Now if you don't mind. I'd like to fight!&quot; Apollo screamed as he lunged toward Hypnos, his sword held high over his shoulder. As he grew close to Hypnos he swung the sword down toward's Hypnos's shoulder. <p>      *~*The Golden God*~*

This was frankly, and utterly pointless. It was apparent Hypnos the silver-footed fool, was just going to keep playing games until the cows came home. His sun-like aura grew in temperature as he willed it. The mud around him hardened until it shattered into a fine dust. Apollo floated from the hole. No use in fighting an &quot;invinsible figure&quot;. Apollo rolled his eyes at the coward Hypnos, who delights in tomfoolery.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hypnos, you come from the heavens, and fight me. Yet nothing I do ever graces you body. You are afraid to take a hit. You are a coward in every sense of the word. Attacking when not provoked, fleeing from all attacks. It is as if you only fight to watch the misery of others. You bring shame to warriors of all kinds with your childishness. I am finished with you, I would have beseached better fight with Poseidon. Please, do not bother me anymore Hypnos. Or I will take up council with Zeus. I doubt you can run from his vengeful attacks.&quot; Apollo's cold stare ran right through Hypnos.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go, go and attack some Amazons. For they do not know what I know, you are as invincible as Zeus himself. Why don't we just make you king of the gods, Heaven let it be known  you just as powerful.&quot; Apollo rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
The armor and weapons on his person vanished in a flash of golden brilliance. And with the magnificants of a autumnal breeze, he blew from the battlefield to the snowy cap of Olympus. Hypnos made nothing but enemies down their on earth. His actions,despicable, his words, shady, and he himself was one of the most cowardly entities he had ever come across in his life. Like it would kill him to actually fight someone.<br>
<br>
Apollo had no time to think of Hypnos the cowardly any longer, the night was growing old and he needed his beauty sleep. So to his palace, the palatial wonder built by the lame Hephaestus of the forge, Apollo retired for the night.<br>

He clumzily stomped down the courtyard of Olympus, his hair all disheveled, and a shoulder strap of his tunic falling  off. His eyes were barely open as he grabbed a tart off of the banquet table and waltzed his way over to the reflecting pool to catch up on the events of the war.<br>
He perked a brow as he caught sight of Aphrodite chanting and lifting her hands to the sky.<br>
