Two large men, guards, stood, wearing nothing but leather pants, boots and black leather collers. In there hands, spears. As you walked inside, you notice, nothing but black, the floors and pillars are made of a black marble, as is the alter by the far wall. Tapestries depicting battle scenes hang on the walls. In a heap on the floor are dead bodies of the guards who allowed her temple to be trashed the first time. Large leopards and black panthers sit, licking up the blood, devouring the tasty meat of the men.<br>
<br>
On the top of a long staircase, sits a throne made of black cast iron. It's red velvet backboard trimmed nicly in the metal.<br>
<br>
Sitting upon that throne, Eris, Goddess of Discord, with a smug smirk on her face as she watches some going-on's though her reflecting pool. Her black eyes dance as she watches. By her feet sat one of her diciplines, his back and chest all scratched up, as well as bi marks all over his neck, however, a satisfied look sat on his face. He felt very gratefull for pleasing his goddess the way he did.<br>
<br>
She shifted in her seat and crossed her legs as she kept her eyes on the relecting mirror.:::<br>

     &quot; Sierously Eris why do you'r type of gods and goddess's have sacrificices? Its dumb, stupid, grotesque, and there is allmost no point that i have found to it what so ever? Why do you people order these murders? &quot;<br>

::she got up and walked over to her latest sacrifice laying on the alter...the sound of drips of blood could be heard as it drips into the large silver bowl that it collected into. She walked over, her bare feet stepping into blood that missed the bowl. She reached into the body and tore out the heart. Grinning as she lookd at the god, she ran her tounge over it, licking up the still warm blood. She stopped and threw the heart to her panther.:: Mmmm, he was a tasty one. Not so innocent..not so bad...to bad I didnt know him in his days of living, he would of made quite the interesting servant to say the least.<br>

The metallic scent alone makes my blow flow and gets my juices flowing.<br>

      &quot; If you like it so much, then take it! &quot; He dumps the whole bowl of clood allover her hair and it drips down through her clothes and all over her body.<br>

      &quot; The look certainly fits a person like you! &quot; He turns around and walks away and teleports himself back to his mighty cave in Thrace. <br>

         &quot; It is unlikely but if there are no dead people around then maybe one day i will have a civilized conversation with you. Maybe whene you be civilized... If you wish to speak to me come to my home in my cave in Thrace... The maybe we can do whatever &quot;buiseness&quot; it is that needs to be done... &quot;<br>
