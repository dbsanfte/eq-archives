There he had been told that his wife was chained in the cavern's of the great serpent there by Ion.  The path up the final mountain was treacherous.  After dodging a few sliding rocks, he finally found himself at the mouth of the Lair of the Serpent.  His blue eyes were cautious as he stepped slowely inside the caverns. As the cavern began to darken, Herc grabbed one of the small torches that barely lit the walls and floors therein.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uherculestlj.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hercules TLJ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hero</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(3/20/01 6:39:21 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Lair of the Serpent</span><hr size=1> As the hero walked along the corridor of the cavern, his heart racing not sure exactly what this serpent was like.  He just knew nothing was going to stop him.  His feet moved slowely upon the gravely path that crinkled lightly underneath his weight.  <br>
Soon, he came upon a large room that had three paths further within the Lair.  Stopping to look at the different entrances, he placed his large hands on his hips and gazed at them.<br>
&quot;Of course, there would be three entrances to decide on,&quot; he whispered to himself.  Then, he could hear hissing deep within one.  &quot;Oh, that would be the one.&quot;<br>
If there was anything Herc knew, it was that the path hardest taken was where you would find what you were looking for.  With that, he stepped into the third entrance.  As he walked the walls became wider and taller.  &quot;This is not good.&quot;  He thought, it only means a larger Serpent. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uthebeautifulserena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Beautiful Serena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(3/20/01 7:03:57 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Lair of the Serpent</span><hr size=1> meanwhile further in Serena sat there chained against a cold and dark wall.

Then suddenly, the tunnel stopped.  &quot;Oh, great,&quot; he said as he then looked up to see that the tunnel seemed to go straight up now.  He walked to the wall and looked for a way to climb it.  There were rocks and roots to grab onto.  So, Hercules began to heave himself up the walls of the tunnel. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uherculestlj.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hercules TLJ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hero</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(3/28/01 6:07:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Lair of the Serpent</span><hr size=1> &quot;SCREEECH!!!&quot;<br>
Just as Hercules turned his head up to look for that which made the noise, he was suddenly grabbed around the middle.  His body bent over as it was quickly pulled up from the tunnel.  Then he founds himself face to face with the Serpent who held the hero before it's drooly mouth.  <br>
&quot;oh, well,&quot; he coughed at the bad breath of the serpent,&quot;good morning to you, too.&quot;  The son of Zeus grabbed the coils that held him with his large hands and began to push to free himself from the serpents grip.  The serpent waved Hercules back and forth, seeming to taunt the thought of eating the hero.  <br>
Then with a growl and hard push, Hercules freed himself.  Falling to the ground and then catching himself as he met the surface.  His blue eyes looked up at the serpent as he dusted his hands free of the cave's sand.  <br>

Hercules jumped aside, away from the serpent's bite.  The serpent pulled it's head back and then lashed out again.  This time Herc barely escaped as he dodged and hid behind a stalactite.  Hercules eyed the stalactite and pulled it from it's base.  The serpent again lunged to bit Hercules.  As he did, Hercules stuck the stalactite into the Serpent's mouth.  The beast pulled back and waved it's head back and fourth in frustration.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uherculestlj.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hercules TLJ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hero</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(4/16/01 3:43:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> the lair</span><hr size=1> &quot;That should do the trick,&quot; Hercules looked up at the frantic creature and then dodged around it and deeper into the cavern.  He sloweled to a walk, listening for the slightest sound.  Until, he turned a corner and there he saw Serena.  A great feeling of relief fell over him, but he knew he still had to get her out of there.  He ran over to her, &quot;Serena! Are you ok?&quot; He began to quickly use his god given strength to break the chains that held her to the wall.  Then finally releasing her and pulling her into his arms, holding her tight. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uherculestlj.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hercules TLJ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hero</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(5/2/01 4:38:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Serena in his arms</span><hr size=1> &quot;Yes, I am okay!&quot; Serena smiled, know much relieved to be with Hercules.<br>
&quot;Good, now we just have to get you out of here,&quot; Hercules took Serena's hand and began to lead her out of the cavern.  They soon came upon the Serpent who was still thrashing it's head about.  Quickly, they rushed around it and ran out thru the halls of the cavern.  <br>
A loud rumble was heard behind them.  Herc turned to see the Serpent coming for them.  &quot;Oh, Great.&quot; He motioned for Serena to hide behind a nook in the wall.  She pouted a little, melting his heart at that moment.  But, she darted and hid in the nook.  Hercules turned his blue eyes to the oncoming Serpent.  The hall was so small that the Serpent did not have much room to move.  Hercules looked up and noticed that the ceiling of the hall was mostly boulders that looked loose.  <br>
&quot;Serena....run down the hall.. get out of here!&quot; <br>
&quot;But, Hercules..!!!&quot; Serena pouted.<br>
&quot;NOW!&quot; <br>
Serena glanced at the serpent..and then ran out of the caverns.  Hercules watched the serpent...and just as it neared him...He pounded his fist up into the ceiling and then ran.  His immortal strength broke the boulders from their resting spot...crashing down upon the head of the serpent. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uherculestlj.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hercules TLJ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hero</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(5/2/01 4:41:22 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> End of the Serpent.</span><hr size=1> As Hercules rushed down the corridor..dust and small rocks flew behind him.
