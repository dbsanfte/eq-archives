I guess we will start with the docks where the Captain moors his ships. You can see the wares he has for trading and you can also tell him what is needed.

Having the alliance with the Amazon women would be a good thing.  They were strong and Skye needed the protection of them.::  I think it's time to tour the village now if you women are ready.  I would hate to see you leave without seeing what we have accomplished.  ::Justine rose and taking the lead, she opened the Inn's door and held it for the women to pass.::<br>
Let's go to the docks first.  ::Justine took the a little down the main road to where Captain Merlobo's fleet was moored. There were 7 ships docked at this time, some unloading crates from their holds.  Justine explained that Skye had trade agreements with many and fresh food, ores, wine, fabrics, gemstones, wax and herbs were imported.  Then, the finished products were exported back to them such as candles, jewelry,clothing, arms and healing materials.:: When we first arrived in Skye, there was nothing here.  The ships had to be moored out there in the loch because there were no docks. We lost a lot of our supplies on the trip as we met with a big storm for many days.  I was not the leader then. His name was Ulysses.  One night, after we arrived, he disappeared and we never saw him again.  Rumor has it that he was murdered, his body throw off those cliffs there. ::Justine pointed to some cliffs which hung over the loch.::  But his body was never found.  Since I was Second in Command, I took over the running of the Clan.  Within a few days, shelters were built up to protect us from the elements.  Soon, Zak Carrera from Carnait Cove arrived with his men.  With their help, the docks were built and all these buildings were erected.  ::Justine's hand encompassed the surrounding area::  He, himself, restored the armory there up on that hill.  ::Justine pointed to a large Castle::  He fixed each stone by hand, restoring the only remaining building to its regal appearance. It is called the Carrera Armory in his honor.  Once we were able to inhabit the buildings, he had to leave.  We miss him and his men but, they had their own families and homes to take care of.<br>
::Justine started towards the stores.::  We have many different shoppes here.  There is a candle shoppe run by Miranda. The arms shoppe is run by Quinne, an old friend who has joined us recently.  ::Justine pointed to the shoppes as they passed, giving a small description of the person who runs it.  Belinda makes crystals and jewelry in this shoppe.  Rowena is our Ambassador.  She lives here and without all her help, I don't know how we would have survived.  Of course, this is the smitty shoppe.  Danny is priceless.  He can make anything needed with the minimal amount of supplies.  ::Justine turned and went in the other direction::  We have a wine shoppe, the finest wines are sold here.  Cuilaech and Spirit share in the running of the shoppe.  Cuilaech has her own Inn.  But then you know that for that is the place where we met.  She is priceless to me.  <br>
::Justine pointed to the Healers building and a few other smaller shoppes as they passed.  Justine was very proud of all that had been accomplished by the Clan in such a short time.::<br>
And this is the Sorrendale Gardens, a place for departed members to lay in rest for eternity.  The gold plaques are erected in their honor.  They are missed but will never be forgotten.<br>
::They had arrived at the end of the road::  Of course there are many homes - cabins - where people live outside the town.  And as we grow, we keep expanding.  Farming is growing now here.  The soil is fertile and soon we will have no need to import our food.  The livestock is growing and we have fresh meat, eggs and milk provided everyday.<br>
Well ladies, that is the end of our tour of Skye.  ::Justine smiled::  Do you have any questions?  Is there anything else you would like to see? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://hometown.aol.com/queenhippolyte/BC.html BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(8/22/00 5:19 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://facelink.com/Hippolyte?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Signing</span><hr size=1> ::smirks:: Well...actually, I don't know about Sethra here..but I would truly like to see your stables.

Your horses are ready for your departure.  There is a special saddlebag filled with food and drink for your trip.  And I have made sure that Captain Merlobo is shipping you a supply of this coffee you have become so fond of.  It should arrive even before you do.  And the mare and dog shall remind you both of your trip here.  And the love of our people for yours. <br>
