Alastor is an Immortal that has been walking this earth longer than most gods. He has watched civilizations come and go he has seen more battles than Ares himself. He has seen his friends and his loves come and go with time.  His original people are the backbone of what are now many different nomad tribes. He has spent time with most of them, the Saxons, the Goths, and even the Vikings. <br>
<br>
         This is how he gained the name of “Demon of The Battlefield” for his unmatched rage and abilities in the thick of the battle. He has traveled to the Far East to receive training in the art of war. Surprisingly the code of the Samurai does not differ far from the code of honor some Vikings obey.        <br>
<br>
        His powers are rather pale in comparison to other immortals but he more than makes up for it in ability.. He has the power to heal at an amazing rate from almost any wound. His sword is said to be unbreakable because of its magical Runes, seeing it held up against a Titan. He also has the ability to communicate with some forms of animals. His fighting abilities are almost unmatched among those who have tested him. He has waged war for centuries and those who meet him on a battlefield under an opposing flag. God help them.<br>

The Beginning ..</span><hr size=1> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp …I remember the darkness..<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Before I woke up, this strange calm and silent darkness that engulfed me in its grasp. It held me there for what seemed like an eternity without really holding me at all. I was completely naïve I didn’t know what was out there in the world around me, but then it happened.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I was suddenly ripped out of that place that had imprisoned me. Torn backwards through what seemed like a snaking tunnel of flashing lights and energy. Then there was a massive burst of light all around me. I was snapped back to a place I did not know the blistering cold lashing out at every part of my body. I was lying flat on my stomach against the snow-covered ground as wind whipped over my back. I gasp for air as I force myself onto my hands and knees, my whole body was trembling. That’s when I realized lying in a puddle of dark red blood, I could tell it was mine by my soaked clothing. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I must have been lying there for hours, my body was so cold I couldn’t feel a wound. As I stirred I managed to get a look at what was around me. It was a village set a flame, bodies that looked like me a moment ago dead in the crimson snow. The buildings where engulfed with dancing flames. I looked at the burning house nearest to me, I could feel the warmth and yearned to be closer to it. I moved my hand to rush forward towards the fire, my hand touched something warm in the snow. Anything warm was instantly valuable to me as I snatched it up as I crawled. I didn’t even examine what I had found until I was within the warm of the fire.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I thrust my hands towards the fire instinctively as I felt the cold recede from my fingers. Only then did I pause to feel my back where my wound should have been. I only felt my bare skin and the slit in my clothing, the frozen blood on my clothes was misleading me, or was it? Confused I looked down at the object I had found in the snow. It was a large sword how it managed to stay warm in the snow, I do not know. I remember this was the first time I traced my fingers over the Runes. My mind began to blur at this exact moment. I had dozens of thought blurring through my mind! Where am I? Is this my village? What Happened? Who am I?<br>
