Kessara looked up, golden eyes sparkling. &quot;But it's fun, isn't it?&quot;<br>
Ayla refused to answer, but she knew that she would never had agreed to this venture if she hadn't been intrigued. &quot;So this is Themiscrya?&quot; she asked, to no one really. <br>
&quot;Yes,&quot;Kessara said. On this rare occassion, Kessara chose to shift into her human form. They stood in the middle of the villiage, shielding themselves from mortal eyes. An Amazon villiage. Intense light blue eyes focused on several women in the villiage. One was working in a forge. Others standing around visiting. Others practicing combat. The one who caught her attention walked past the openning of a stable to the horses within. &quot;Hippolyte,&quot; she remarked, her fascination caught. The granddaughter of Hera. Ayla had never met the Queen of the Gods, for reasons of her own. She realized sadly, that Kessara and Hermes were possible her only friends. Hermes, the messanger of the gods had always come to her when the gods had vengence in mind. Ayla, the once Assasin of the Gods, frowned.<br>
 Hippolyte walked out of the stable and walked toward a hut. Ayla was severely startled when the Amazon queen looked her directly in the eyes. &quot;Impossible,&quot; she whispered. No mortal could see a god unless wished so. Then she was reminded quickly. Hippolyte was not mortal. She was the daughter of a god. &quot;Aw hell,&quot; Ayla said. &quot;If she comes over here, you are going to explain this to her!&quot; Kessara smiled. <br>
    &quot;It's about time we introduced ourselves to the world don't you think?&quot; Kessara commented. Ayla stiffened. &quot;I don't want to do this.&quot;<br>
 &quot;Why not?&quot;<br>
Ayla remained silent. Blue eyes focused on Hippolyte and lost the angry look caused by Kessara. Well, it would be interesting.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Queen</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#993300>(3/7/01 8:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=169.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Goddesses in Themiscrya</span><hr size=1>  Dawn stood leaning against her hut, the cold bustling about her.

She turned in a slow circle, her blue eyes freezing to a silvery blue, almost white color.<br>
<br>
Kessara turned to her friend, a smile on her face, which faded immeadiately. This wasn't the Guardian Ayla, this was Ayla the Assassin. Cold, pale, calculating eyes searched the village in a chilling silence, then Ayla's circle stopped at a hut, where an impressive mortal woman -at least Kessara thought she was mortal- stood. Kessara couldn't tell if the woman could truly see them, but she was looking in their general direction. Ayla stared at her for several second, then her eyes turned back to their normal color. <br>
 <br>
Ayla blinked rapidly. She knew she had over-reacted, but it was a force of habit. The woman knew they were there, she knew that. But she didn't know if the woman welcomed them, or not. &quot;I think it is about time we left,&quot; she murmured. Kessara's gold eyes narrowed. <br>
<br>
&quot;Fine.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ayla turned to leave, gratefully, for she did not want to confront anyone. Unfortunately, the Fates never made life, even an immortal's life, that easy. Rheia, one of Ayla's four adopted half-god children appeared before them, in a flash of green. Rheia was the youngest of the four, at six years old, and by far the mischievous. Hazel-green eyes twinkled with pleasure. &quot;Mommy!&quot; She flung herself at Ayla's legs, Rheia's black hair wild. Her curiousity was brought full swing, as the young halg-god turned to the village. &quot;Wow, an amazon village! Kreon told me about these.&quot; <br>
<br>
Ayla frowned. She would have to talk to Kreon. Her second youngest adopted child, and only boy of the four, was constantly stirring trouble with his little &quot;sister,&quot; although he was only seven. Ayla can remember how his grey eyes turn smokey when he is guilty of some trouble. <br>
<br>
Ayla turned her attention back to Rheia, who, to Ayla's alarm and dismay, was racing toward the village, and directly into the path of the woman. With a sigh, she followed after her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://hometown.aol.com/queenhippolyte/spinningsword.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Vasilissa</span><br>  Posts: 258<br> <font color=#993300>(3/8/01 6:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=169.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/pleiade3/ehipp.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Goddesses in Themiscrya</span><hr size=1> :::Hippolyte glanced at the women who stood in the snow watching the Themiscryans.

The cloak's broach shimmered and was the peacock feather emblem of Hera.  Hippolyte's brown eyes set upon them, and a slight smile rose upon her lips as she joined them.:::<br>

Her eyes followed Rheia cautiously, them turned to the queen. She softened immeadiately to the small woman. She was everything Hermes said she was. Strong, small, but not with out the ability to kick butt. Kessara walked up behind Ayla and whispered to her, &quot;I will get Rheia.&quot; <br>
<br>
Ayla nodded, and Kessara chased after the girl, hopeing to catch her before she reached the woman at the hut. <br>
<br>
Ayla gave Hippolyte a brilliant, geniuine smile. &quot;Hello...I mean Yasoo, your majesty,&quot;Ayla responded. She almost laughed at herself. She had never had many friends, or been around many people when she had been mortal, before she had known she was a goddess striped of her immortality as a child. She didn't know how to act when you wished to be kind. She only had Kessara for an example, and she couldn't treat Hippolyte like one of her children. &quot;Well, if you want the truth, my friend, Kessara and I, were curious about your village,&quot;she said. From a few yards away, Rheia gave a loud whoop of joy. &quot;And, as you can see, so is my daughter.

She didn't know if that was the child's name then, but that was what she had told the woman. Though it didn't really matter, her breathe stopped, and she forced herself to pay attention to the queen, while her mind raced. The child, blessed long ago, by the goddess Assassin. By her. Ayla felt a sense of pride she tried to ignore. She couldn't have chosen better. The child had grown. She was strong. Dawnithina may even be as good -or even better- as Ayla had been. <br>

Ayla turned her attention to Dawn as she began to speak. When she finished, Ayla surpressed a smug grin. A queen. She has definitely done well for herself.

Hipp was thankful that the food stores were plenty enough despite the winter:::  Come, sit down and we can talk.  ::she waved a hand and walked to the table....waiting for all to sit down::: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> GuardianAyla</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(3/15/01 4:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=169.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Guests</span><hr size=1> Ayla motioned for Kessara and Rheia to sit, while she did the same. Ayla opened her mouth to thank Hippolyte, but Rheia leaned forward and began to eat, very fast, stuffing her mouth with food. &quot;Dis goad, tank ew,&quot; she told the queen, her mouth full in the process. Kessara nudged the six year old, and the girl immeadiate silenced, but continued eating rapidly. Ayla smiled apologetically. She reached for a fruit, hesitantly and slowly took a bite. It had been so long since she had eaten mortal food. It was fabulous. &quot;Thank you Hippolyte,&quot; Ayla said, a brilliant smile on her face. Within seconds the fruit was reduced to a simple seed. Kessara followed Ayla example. Ayla paused. &quot;I am so sorry,&quot; she said, &quot;Are you hungry?&quot; She offered the queen a fruit, with a grin.  For the first time she was relaxed. She wished she had been this relaxed when Dawn was here, then maybe the amazon queen would not be angry with her. Hermes told her that mortal's feelings toward her and the gods shouldn't bother her, but she did not like being hated or feared. Which would explain her career change from an asassin to a guardian. Eternity is a long time for people to hate you. She focused back on Hippolyte, and her happiness reflected in her eyes.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Queen</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#993300>(3/16/01 6:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=169.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guests</span><hr size=1>  Dawn nudged the door open with her nose, and padded into the Tavern. Her mouth was clamped around the neck of a dead rabbit, which she carried into the back for the Amazons to prepare later. Then as she padded around the bar from the kitchen, she came to the Queen and the other two. Settling next to Hippolyte's feet, she cast a glance upward, emerald eyes looking at Ayla.<br>

Evil and hungry
I'm just a craving soul
Craving for your blood and death; M'Dear
Don't worry it won't hurt..
Just a dagger or two.. 
Crimson spilling onto my hands..
Running over the flesh to drip from my elbow
Scarring the black leather pants..
Mmmm its yummy

Don't bother to scream... they won't catch me

A tall dark warrior walked into the hut and straight to Hippolyte's table.  Hipp looked up at her with a raised brow. "Yasoo, Marpe...what is it?"<br>
"My Queen,"Marpe spoke in a sure warrior tone. "There is someone who has come to speak to you in utmost importance."<br>
Hippolyte nodded, "very well." Her eyes turned back to the two.  "It seems I have something I need to tend to.  I hope you can both keep each other company..while I am away." She glanced warily from one to the other and then stepped away from her chair.  "Herete!"  After saying goodbye, she followed Marpe out of the hut. <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>
