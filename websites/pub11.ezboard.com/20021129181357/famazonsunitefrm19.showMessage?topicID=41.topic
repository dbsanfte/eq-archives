A place where Vengence is easily obtained.</span><hr size=1>  Dawn hadn't taken her time in finding who had attacked Meg. Infact once the Roman seal had been mentioned, Dawn was short on explanations. In fact, Dawn wasn't really one to sit back and listen to the story, she knew where she had to be. <br>
<br>
 Once she had climbed into the saddle of her horse, she hadn't stopped for anything, not even to warn Ares of her departure.. she knew this outcome wasn't going to be the best, whenever Dawn visited Rome the outcome had been the worst she could have fathomed.<br>
<br>
 When she neared the gates to Rome, she slowly slid from her horse, letting him trot off into some vacant pasture. Dawn and her horse were one, and she wasn't interested in losing him to Caesar. Dawn pulled a leather trench coat around her shoulders, hiding the weaponary at her side, and anything distinctfully linking her to Ares, or the Amazons (of course she had long ago lost the distinction toward the Amazons).<br>
<br>
 With a smooth smile, the gaurds let Dawn through the gates. And once in the market place she fell right into sync with the goings on, and soon found herself in a large group, climbing the castle stairs. Yes, Dawn worked fast when her mind was set on one person, especially Caesar. <br>
<br>
 She took a deep breath, and slipped down off to a side hall. One that led right to the private chambers of the emperor himself. It'd been awhile since Dawn had been in the palace but she was sure he'd be there, and she was sure there would be a few guards. <br>
<br>
 But the guards were easy to take care of, and soon Caesar was greet with a dagger pointed at his throat, and an angry assassin in his face.<br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;My, my. Dawnithinia....what a pleasant suprise.&quot;<br>
<br>
He wasn't expecting Dawn to show up. More along the lines of Xena, or Alysia.<br>
<br>
&quot;Meg? That was Meg? Mm, I thought it was Xena...&quot;<br>
<br>
He lied through his teeth. He knew that was Meg, and he would have done this himself; seeing the barmaid didn't stay out as long as he had hoped.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know, Dawnithinia, you risk not only your well-being by coming here; but also your life.&quot;<br>

Yes, that was a threat.

 &quot;You knew it wasn't Xena. You've been around enough to know that wasn't Xena. Xena doesn't have the medallion that Meg wears. Want to give me a better lie?&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn didn't move, infact if anything the dagger's tip came closer to Caesar's flesh, and throat. She was buying her time, she knew how long she'd have before the guards retained conciousness.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I don't risk anything coming here. I won't die in your hands. I have my protection.&quot;<br>
<br>
 She was right, and she knew he'd be there for her. If only Caesar would take the time to read the emblem on her sword he would know who was going to be her savior. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uemperorjuliuscaesar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Emperor Julius Caesar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#939393>(8/4/02 1:24:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vengeance</span><hr size=1> Caesar smirked yet again, and he wiped the spit from his face. His eyes moving to the door to see a couple of the guards stir; and began calling for more to help. He grinned to her, leaning foreward a bit; the tip of the dagger pericing his flesh as he leaned.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know that, you know that....my men don't.&quot;<br>
<br>
But, it wasn't like his guards cared if it was Xena or not. His caught the insignia of Ares on her sword, and he was suprised. This woman was in league with the Greecian War God? He would have thought twice about this, but he figured Ares wouldn't miss this one, probably a plaything to him more than a Warrior...if only Caesar knew that Dawn was more than just a Warrior for the War God.<br>
<br>
&quot;They do anything I tell them, whether the person's innocent or not.&quot;<br>
<br>
He grinned, seeing more men come to his chambers.<br>
<br>
&quot;I sincerely hope you enjoy your stay, Dawnithinia.&quot;<br>
<br>
He looked to the guards.<br>

She drew the dagger back, whipping it behind her toward one of the guards, it would be strong enough to pierce through his armor and straight into his heart. This would spare her even more time.<br>
<br>
 She took a step back, throwing a punch at Caesar's nose. A proud grin slipped across Dawn's lips once she felt the bone underneather her hand crack and almost crumble.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Order a broken nose? Or was it a broken reproductive system?&quot;<br>
<br>
 Before he could answer, Dawn sent a final kick to Caesar's groin. About this time, the one guard left and his back up entered the room, locking Dawn's arms behind her back, one taking the sword of Ares from her side.<br>
<br>
 &quot;What do you want us to do with this, sir?&quot; The guard asked, holding the sword out infront of them all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uemperorjuliuscaesar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Emperor Julius Caesar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#939393>(8/4/02 1:37:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Lock her up!</span><hr size=1> The Roman grinned as the guards came running, but when the fist hit his face he winced, his hand flying to his nose.

He looked to the woman as the blood trickled from his nose; and his eyes narrowed.<br>

<br>
&quot;Have it your way, Ares.&quot;<br>
<br>
He smirked.<br>

&quot;...If I ever catch her back here again, I won't hesitate to kill her.&quot;<br>

He re-appeared before Dawn's cell, eyeing the guards drew their sword. &quot;Try me!&quot; He held his hand up, and a ball of blue energy formed. He grinned as they ran, and just for fun, zapped one in the ass. He waved a hand at the cell door, and it opened.

She smiled proudly, holding her hands out infront of her, as she slowly manuvered her hands out of the shackles. <br>
<br>
 She gave a sly smile to Ares, before taking back her sword. With one flick of her wrist she had the metal weaponary sheathed back at her side, giving a soft pat to the scabbard which held her sword. <br>
<br>
 &quot;I think I miss the power more.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn teased, slowly wrapping her arms around Ares neck, to give him a soft kiss on the lips.<br>
