Knowing full well that these women worshipped Artemis, and she was part of these woman, though, she was hardly the warrior, she felt it necessary to give thanks to Artemis as well. She wasn't great, but Theadora could hold her own in a fight, and if there was no wind blowing, she could aim a pretty mean arrow, but that was the jest of her skills....in that area anyway. Reading from a sroll that green was a symbol of sorts of Artemis, she pulled out a dark green almost sheer dress from her wardrobe. She slid into the dress and ran her hands down her sides.<br>

She said to herself, then walked out into the warm afternoon. Following the path to the pavillion that she was told to follow, she stopped when she saw Velaska's daughter Melousa carrying a boy by his coller and grumbling to herself, then she walked on, getting to the pavillion and walking in, she stopped in awe.

She walked to the table with some drinks on it and poured herself half a mug of meade, then filled it with some water.

Hipp looked at DeLerium and wondered when she would begin a prayer or speech to the Goddess.  Of course, she didn't know what the Queen had planned except for the sacrifice of the murderer.<br>

She glanced to Melanippe and Myrto, &quot;Go eat.. make friends...or just pray. I am getting something to drink,&quot; Hippolyte then turned and walked over to the long table.  Her eyes scanning for a bit of wine, and then her eyes settled on an unopened bottle.  <br>

&quot;Sisters, This day we worship the great Artemis, our Protectress and a sister warrior. We give her thanks for the many things she has done for us, the great hunts she had provided us, and the safe journies she has helped us to accomplish. We feast in her honor...An archery contest will be held in her honor, A sacrifice of a woman who has killed another amazon, will be made in her honor. Following that, an all night hunt in honor of Artemis will take place, each contestant will pair up with another and you will be set off to hunt in our woods until sunrise. The pair who brings back the most, wins.&quot;<br>

When DeLerium finished speaking, Hippolyte lifted up her bottle of red wine in the Queen's honour.  &quot;Opah!&quot; She called out in approval and then drank her wine, enjoying the warm liquid's
