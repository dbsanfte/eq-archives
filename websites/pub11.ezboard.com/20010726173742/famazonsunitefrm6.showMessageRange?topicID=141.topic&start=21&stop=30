&quot;Wolf's Blood is not needed. Just a little bruises here and there.&quot; He smiled. &quot;Nothing I haven't been able to handle in the past.&quot;<br>
<br>
The past. . . . <br>
<br>
A word they all knew very well.<br>
<br>
<br>
As Alysia began to turn from them, Wulf sat up and spoke.<br>
&quot;Where ya going Mom?&quot;<br>
<br>
Calling Aly &quot;Mom&quot; Came easy of course. He had done it his whole life, but then again. Calling Dawn &quot;Mom&quot; Came just as well.

Gently Dawn pressed her hand to Wulf's chest, and the green light engulfed the boy, following there was a bright flash which sent a sensation through Wulf, and when everyones eyes adjusting, the light was gone and Dawn was sitting back on her haunches now. For using alittle bit of energy made her abit weak in the knees.<br>

Of course this was hard for her, but when it came to her children, they always came before Alysia's self importance.<br>

<br>
 She listened to the boy as she gently rubbed her temples.<br>
<br>
 &quot;But you didn't have to come back, the ancients were probably taking better care of you than we could have ever done..a cooshy life with them..so to speak.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Wulf of the Ancients</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(6/1/01 5:19:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=141.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   . . .</span><hr size=1> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
Wulf couldn't help but smirk at Dawn's comment.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cooshy nothing.&quot; He laughed lightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Ancients are gaining control over their world. Ever since Samsara. . er. . Mom chose to return, the world has been lacking in something. An essence you could say. Well they eventually gained that essence back when Aunt Gabrielle came and stayed there for a while. But Gabby left and I kinda took over. Then the Atmah was gone.&quot;<br>
<br>
He yawned a little bit as he spoke . . .<br>
<br>
&quot;Some of the other ancients weren't ready to accept Cyane leaving us. They weren't ready for Samsara to either. I think that is a way of learning. Doing something least expected to change the course of the world. It helps others learn.&quot; <br>
<br>
He smiled, even after all this time and everything he had gone through, he was still the same sweet Wulf.<br>
<br>
&quot;But well, to make an endless story short, we were watching Nataliya come to Scynthia. Saw her harmed. The ancient that was watching her came to Cyane the second and myself immediatly. We were originally going to go and save her ourselves, but we knew that by the time we had gone through the portals and reached her. . . . her soul and body would both be gone.&quot;<br>
<br>
He sighed lightly and looked at Dawn.<br>
<br>
&quot;She did not suffer, Alysia had taken her pain from her.&quot; He smiled at the small vile of the medication called 'Wolf's Blood'. &quot;You have taken great efforts in making sure the Shaman art has not passed through like many traditions.&quot;<br>
<br>
He then looked back to them both.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cyane and the others were of course worrying for the sake of the child. They knew that the Wolf's Blood could not save her life, and Aly was too far away from Scynthia to properly heal her. She passed from internal bleeding. Nothing could have been done.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;While the others were conversing about what was to be done, I told Cyane that I was going back. She knew what I was planning to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
He smiled to them both.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Ancients are a great tribe, they have taught me much. No where as much as they have passed to you Mom.&quot; He spoke to Aly. &quot;But much none the less.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But nothing could take the place of this tribe. These lands. Watching the Scynthian tribe grow is no where near the wonderness of actually being there to experience it.. . . nothing.&quot;<br>
<br>
He smiled. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Queen</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#993300>(6/1/01 7:47:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=141.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Listening.</span><hr size=1>  Dawn listened as Wulf spoke of her daughter. As much as Dawn knew that her daughter needed to be taken care of on the otherside, she prayed secretly in her heart that her father would never get to see her there. Ever since Cupid was killed she realized how much she dispised her exhusband. No matter now, emerald eyes were locked on Wulf. She sat back now on haunches like a Wolf and then stood making her way to her horse.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Thank you though, for taking care of my daughter. I was hoping to pass on something different to her. Not so much of a blood lust.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn grinned lightly, she knew there would have been no way of stopping her daughter from gaining that bloodlust. She was just like Dawn, only with alot more god like powers, but still she had the part Wolf and part Tiger in her. Now so did Wulf as he did have Natailya's body. <br>
<br>
 Dawn realized this, and looked at Wulf with bold emeralds. Perhaps they needed to talk soon. No One..and Dawn ment No One knew what her soul or Natailya's was like besides Dawn. Her parents were dead and thus she was the only one left. Wulf would have to be taught just what it was like, he would have to be trained (Deja vu) on how to handle, he could shift now.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=141.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessage?topicID=150.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessage?topicID=143.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=141.topic&index=30><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=141.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.threadControl?topicID=141.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=141.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=141.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm28">Amazon Sisters of Cremni<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6>Amazons of the Northern Lands</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
