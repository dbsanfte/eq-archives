Her long black robes trailing her slim form.<br><br>Ariana appeared from the forest's edge, in her usual dark cloak of green:: Something feels strange in the air. ::She murmored.::<br><br>Tasha :: looks at hipp:: you fall down??<br><br>Hipp *raised a brow and smirked at her daughter* Yes.. surprise surprise.. I do sometimes..fall down. * she laughed*<br><br>Tasha moonlight: :: giggles::<br><br>Aphrodite watches Hera and wonders why she suddenly walked over to the reflecting pool.  She hops off her throne and looks over Hera's shoulder at the reflecting pool::  <br><br>Slowely the waters in the reflecting pool cleared from their misty vision.  The reveal a dark green forests for the Goddesses.<br><br>Hera: Well, greetings Dite.  Joining me in seeing what the mortals are up to this day?<br><br>Ariana headed towards the village.  Anythign beat staying alone by the creepy forest.::<br><br>~Suddenly Ariana heard a strange rumbling growl behind her in the woods.~<br><br>Aphrodite moves to Hera's side. &quot;Sure....Anything of interest going on??&quot;<br><br>Tasha walks around hipp::i didn't know things like that happen to you<br><br>Ariana whipped her head around, the blue auora quickly dispensing to her hands:: ACK! what the hell was that?! ::She studied her surroundings apprenhisivly::<br><br>Hipp:  Tasha, every now and then of course I.... *Hipp stopped speaking as she felt her skin crawl ..hearing something faintly but not sure what it was.*<br><br>Tasha :: watches::  Mother are you well??<br><br>Suddenly the waters rippled before the Goddess, making Hera's brow raise. <br><br>Aphrodite looks at the female mortals in the forest.  She raised a brow as the action begins below. &quot;Are you doing that?&quot;she askes Hera.<br><br>Hipp:  Yes.. I thought I heard something in the distance.  *she tilted her head at Tasha* Didn't you?<br><br>Tasha moonlight: ::tilts her head:: no i don't think so<br><br>Hera:  No.. Dite.. that wasn't me.  *her blue eyes pierced into the waters..trying to see what it was, she ran a hand over the waters..but still all it showed was a blury figure in the woods*<br><br>Ariana: I'm just seeign things...::Ariana tried to calm herself, but her body still trembled:: <br><br>~A whish of wind was felt as a deer quickly rushed by Ariana, then birds screached and flew in the same direction~<br><br>Aphrodite narrows her sky blue eyes to try to see clearly through the pool::  &quot;Something doesn't seem right here!&quot; she thinks aloud.<br><br>Hera:  Maybe my power of vision is off....*she looked to Dite.* Aphrodite...why don't you give the pools a try?<br><br>Ariana: Gods, this isn't good...::Sensing the tension in the wind, she could only stand there awaiting what would befall her: curiosity killed the cat::<br><br>Hipp: *she shrugged her shoulders* Maybe it was just me.  Or maybe I hit my head when I fell.<br><br>Aphrodite squints and struggles to catch a clear glimse of the earth below.  She shakes her head in frustration.  &quot;I can't see a thing!&quot;<br><br> ~A loud Crash is heard behind Ariana, the earth shaking.~<br><br>Aphrodite ::She throws her hand up:: &quot;Maybe I show go down and take a look-see for myself&quot;<br><br>Hipp: *feeling the rumble of the earth below her* Endaksi...now that was something<br><br>Ariana: ::Falling to her knees, she screamed.:: Ahhhh!  ::Her eyes wide in surprise, blue bolts of energy errupted from her body::<br><br>Hera: Maybe we should...least some other form of power believes it can take our woods!<br>*In a flash of light, Hera dissappeared and reappeared into the thick of the woods*<br><br>Hipp: *with concern in her eyes* Amazons.....get alert.. all warriors prepare.  *she mumbled* for who knows what. <br><br>In an instant, Aphrodite dissapears of the mighty Mt. Olympus and reappears in the wood.  She looks around, trying to soak in all the she could quickly to assess the situation.::<br><br>Ariana::Breathing hard, she got a hold of herself.. the ground had quieted down.:: By what sorcery does the eath move as such?!<br><br>~Again the earth shook, as suddenly a misty form apeared behind Aphrodite~<br><br>Hera: Aphrodite..watch out! *she motioned behind the Goddess of Love*<br><br>A wide-eye Aphrodite makes was for a tree to keep herself steady::  &quot;What in Zeus is going on here!?&quot; She exclaims rather loudly.<br><br>Hipp: Amazon Guardians..guard the city *she quickly gave orders as she grabbed the reigns of a horse she had posted near her*<br><br>Tasha runs in and finds a horse ::<br><br>~Suddenly the dark mist envelopes Dite and  surrounds her so no one can see~<br><br>Tasha rides out to be at her mothers side::<br><br>Ariana: I've got to warn my sisters...I don't know what this is, but...::She tore off her cloak, biting back stabbing pains in her back.  A cool trickle of blood ran down her back, and then she spread foth her wings in a flurry of feathers.<br><br>Hipp shifts upon the back of her horse.  Warriors.. prepare.. get your mounts. Now!<br><br>Aphrodite tries to let out a scream.  As the mist surrounds her, her voice slowly trails off.  Aphrodite is out of view to all, even the Queen Goddess herself:: <br><br>Hera: DITE!!!!!!!! *Hera ran towards the dark from as she saw the Goddess of Love dissappear.*<br><br>Ariana::Huffing and puffing, she arrieved before her Queen and the band of warriors:: *huff**<br><br>~the village became an active flurry...like bees in a hive..they began to mill about to prepare for anything.~<br><br>The Queen and the warriors were quickly armed by the armory.  Weapons handed out.. ready.<br><br>Hera: Alright....that is it. *Her cold eyes narrowed at the form*  You had better return her..and I mean now.  A slender hand moved to send a bolt of power at the form and then suddenly Hera found her ownself eveloped by the mist.<br><br>End Sim To Be Cont. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uaubard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AU Bard</A> at: 10/4/01 9:03:06 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.showPrevMessage?topicID=5.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.showNextMessage?topicID=5.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/slate/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.emailToFriend?topicID=5.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.threadControl?topicID=5.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/slate/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm37">The Mythical Odyssey Forum<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitefrm32">The Mythical Odyssey<option value="amazonsunitefrm35">Amazon Nation Alliance<option value="amazonsunitefrm33">Character Descriptions<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm30">Amazons of the Sacred Circle<option value="amazonsunitefrm34">Amazons of Lesvos Island<option value="amazonsunitefrm38">High Mountain Tiger Clan<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm31">Amazon Language<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals<option value="amazonsunitefrm39">Guild Applications<option value="amazonsunitefrm40">Sisters of Chadesia</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32>The Mythical Odyssey</a> <font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
