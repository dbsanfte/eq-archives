He listened to what Nike had to say, and noticed the baby, and he realized...it was him::<br>

::A feeling of remorse and shame overtook him, like nothing before.  He didn't realize he was capable of such an attrocious act.  Apparently, much like his father and his brothers, he was very capable of it.::<br>

::Hephaestus shakily stood up.  Being the creator of these indestructable chains, only he was able to unlock them.  Very similar to those that chained the mighty Prometheus.  Hephaestus, let the chains fall to the floor at his feet.  With that, he hobbled over to grab his crutch.  With that he hobbled his way into the workshop itself and closed the steel door.::<br>

::With that, minutes later, the entire shop filled with near searing heat.  A loud pounding could be heard from behind the door, that seemed earshattering, almost as loud as one of Zeus' thunderbolts:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=goddessathena>Goddess Athena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 110<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(7/28/02 6:12:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=258.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Child</span><hr size=1> Despite what had happened, Athena had a soft heart and the child that Nike handed to her was so innocent.<br>

Sarabi was in her Priestess chambers when the Violation had went down. She wanted to go to Athena feeling something was wrong but she had not a way of finding her Goddess.<br>

Then Poseidon said, &quot;Yes, you could say that was a grand scheme Hecate!&quot; He laughs the while he is speaking, &quot;Besides I've been meaning to get back at that two bit goddess Athena and what better way than to violate her in the worst of ways.&quot; <br>
