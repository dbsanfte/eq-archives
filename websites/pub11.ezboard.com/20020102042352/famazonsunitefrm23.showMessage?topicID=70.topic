So far only a few others knew about it. Sure they knew there was going to be a feast at the Temple of Tisiphone, but no one really knew why.<br>
<br>
Tisiphone had everything set up. She wanted to make peace between her family. This constant bickering was futile and upsetting, nothing for Hera's new child to come into the world to witness.<br>
<br>
A banquet of food was lined up all along the sides, ambrosia fit for Gods . . . . how ironic.<br>
<br>
Upon another table, sat a large fountain that poured wine from the greatest vines of Dionysus. Goblets and Chalices sat aside waiting to be filled.<br>
<br>
She smiled at her work, knowing there could have been another place better fit for the party, too bad no one else had planned one.<br>
<br>
She sighed knowing she was going to have to speak tonight, so she closed her eyes to rest her mind, for she was going to have to speak telepathically all night long.<br>
<br>
~Well, I sure hope Hera likes her surprise baby shower.~<br>

~Welcome friends, this is Hera's surprise baby shower. Seeing that no one but she knew about the child before it's birth, we are giving her one now.~<br>

~We will be having blessings upon the child, gifts, feasting and drinking, and perhaps even a few games.~<br>
