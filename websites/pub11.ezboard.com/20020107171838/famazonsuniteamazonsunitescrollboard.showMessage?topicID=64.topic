<br>
::When you go in, you will not cry:: Gwendolyn told herself sternly. <br>
<br>
When the barge hit land, Gwendolyn walked out to see all her smiling priestesses and friends awaiting her. Even though it had been almost ten years since she had seen them, they still looked the same. <br>
<br>
::That's the way with priestesses:: Gwen thought ::They look forever young until one day when they just seem old.::<br>
<br>
Angelina, High Priestess now that Gwen left, came up to Gwendolyn and whispered ::Nefertiti will be here soon::<br>
<br>
::Thank You::<br>
<br>
Gwendolyn dismissed the priestesses and decided to go on her own. Philae seemed exactly the same to her: the sand was still that stale brown, the water was still that sky blue..even the air smelled like lotus'. <br>
<br>
Looking at the sun's position, she decided it was almost time for dinner. She walked around the enterance of the temple, and went up the ramp into the dining hall. When walking in, she laughed.<br>
<br>
::Exactly the same!! Nothing changes around here!::<br>
<br>
The chairs and tables were empty, and gwen thought she must of been mistaken on the time. The walk back to the ocean was at least two miles, so she agreed on visiting the rooms. Walking around, she saw all the priestesses were also gone. Gwendolyn thought for a moment, and couting on her fingers, she realized that this was the season of Beltane. <br>
<br>
::They're getting the fires ready:: she thought. She was walking back to the enterance way to help them, and decided she didn't feel like working. <br>
<br>
((I'll go visit my old quarters)) she whispered slightly.<br>
<br>
As Gwen turned to go to the great stairway, she stopped to look at Rachel's room. <br>
<br>
::So long ago this is where we met. She was just a servant and I was the High Priestess:: gwen chuckled ::the Gods are perverse..they must have a sense of humor.::<br>
<br>
Seeing something on the door, Gwen walked closer to it. At first she couldn't tell the shape, but on closer inspection she realized it was a falcon. <br>
<br>
::Amapmehis:: she thought. then her worst realization came true. As she opened the door, she saw corpses strewn about, torn cloths on the floor, and tools on Rachel's bed. The room smelled of nitron, and Gwen cried out for Angelina. Angelina ran in, and stopped at the door. When Gwen looke dat her, she was covered in ashes and a look of fear was on her face.<br>
<br>
::She knows::<br>
<br>
((Angelina, what did you do?!?!))<br>
<br>
Angelina swayed back and forth<br>
<br>
((I'm sorry Gwendolyn...it wasn't my decision...You know how the other priestesses felt when you married Rachel--))<br>
<br>
((--They turned her room into a sinet chamber!!! A place for mummification!! They didn't even take out her things..leave Angelina, JUST LEAVE!!))<br>
<br>
Angelina quickly ran out of the room, to tell the other priestesses what happened, no doubt. Gwen looked around, and almost vomited. Afraid to touch anything, she grabbed a scroll and quill from the side of the bed, and wrote:<br>
<br>
&quot;To the Priestesses of the Temple of Philae:<br>
<br>
I, Gwendolyn, Amazon Warrior, Former High Priestess, and Daughter of Isis write to you. Ten years ago, I married a servant named Rachel. My Queen and dearest friend, Nefertiti, bade us to come to her. She gave us a decision: the people of Egypt would not have their priestess married to a servant, so we could annul the marriage, or go somewhere else. For our love, we risked it. Nefertiti bade us well, and told us to come to the palace in secret.t day, we roamed hills, crossed valleys. Until one day, I came into contact with a woman named Alysia. A Amazon Queen. She welcomed us into their tribe. We styaed happily, and had two twins: Alysia and Artemis. I left my two other children, Thom and Alanna, in your care. Thom and Alanna left in search of me, and they have never been seen again. Alysia and Artemis were kidnapped on my way to see Nefertiti, and I believe them to be somewhere near Norway. Nevertheless, I write to tell you that you are the people who have hurt me: You've banished me, lost my children, and had made a mockery of my pain by turning my wife's room into a room of the dead. Tonight, I will take the dagger my wife had made for me in Scynthia and put it to my heart.<br>
Anuhsi<br>
Gwendolyn.&quot;<br>
<br>
Reading, Angelina wiped her eyes. The body of Gwendolyn had been found the next morning, and, along with everything she had brought, was put into the Beltane fires.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Nut, Goddess of the Sky, looked down on Egypt one night active night. She follwed a beautiful man into a lover's room, watched a child be born, and saw anold man die in his sleep. As time passed, it seem that the cycle of life had been performed before her very eyes. Looking towards the sun, she could see Ra riding his golden chariot.<br>
<br>
::The day awaits:: she thought.<br>
<br>
As she went to uncover her body, she saw something at the corner of her eye. Bending closer, she could see the island of Philae. The Beltane fires were burning, and she thought at first it was two lovers under a white cloth together. She went closer, and almost gasped sending a great wind.<br>
<br>
::They're burning a body at the Beltane fires??::<br>
<br>
She blowed on the wrapping of the corpse, unraveling its body. She sighed seeing it was too late: the body was already ashes. A glimmer caught her eye, and Nut saw a dagger with a black handle and a violet snake carved into the handle.<br>
<br>
In an instant, she knew it was her niece, gwendolyn. Nut cried and her tear fell to the ground as rain. She closed her eyes, and blew to her sister Isis the news of her daughter.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Isis heard Nut's call and rubbed her head.<br>
<br>
::My daughter, my only one::<br>
<br>
Isis cried, and looked up to see Ra riding his chariot across the sky.<br>
<br>
::Life anew:: she thought.<br>
<br>
Isis raised her head, and suddenly knew what to do. She blew to her sister Nut, and Nut blew back in agreement. Isis smiled, and pricked her finger. She looked to the ashes of her daughter, and dropped a single prick of blood on her. The ashes moved and stirred, creating skin, bones, and hair.<br>
<br>
::Life anew:: Isis thought in gratitude ::My daughter lives on in Anck-su-namun::<br>
<br>
Isis blew at Nut and Nut blew back. Ra rode in his chariot, and the day was anew.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Angelina awoke startled, and her face hurting. She looked up to yell at her agressor, and was immideatley startled. Standing above her was a woman she had never seen before: she had olive skin, dark hair, and chocolate eyes. Her clothes were just a plain, white sheet.<br>
<br>
((who are you??)) Angelina demanded.<br>
<br>
((Sorry I slapped you. You wouldn't wake. My name is Anck-su-naum.))<br>
<br>
Angelina snorted ((Please, I am a priestess. Anck-su-namun means reincarnation of the sun. Only through the blood of Isis can that be done.))<br>
<br>
Anck-su-namun looked at her as if she were crazy and asked ((Where am I?))<br>
<br>
((The Temple of Philae.))<br>
<br>
((Where can I get some clothes and see a blacksmith??))<br>
<br>
((Go into the sinet chamber and there is a wooden trunk full fo fine clothes...to see a blacksmith i suggest going to Arsinoe.))<br>
<br>
Anck-su-namun nodded and immediatley went to the sinet chamber. She had never been to the temple before (or could she even remember where she was from) but it seemed to her as if she knew it like the back of her hand. She opened the trunk, and pulled out a silky green garment to wear. As she was leaving, and looked at the floor to see a large spot of blood that disturbed her greatly. <br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
((Are you Arsinoe??))<br>
<br>
A young woman looked at Anck-su-namun curiously, and replied<br>
<br>
((yes))<br>
<br>
((Good. Can you tell me where this dagger is from??))<br>
<br>
Arsinoe looked at the dagger, smiled, and replied<br>
<br>
((Easily. See how the blade is cut and how thin the handle is? It's made for a woman warrior. The metal used from it is only from one place. Scyntha. Probably made by one of the blacksmiths up there.))<br>
<br>
((Where is Scynthia??))<br>
<br>
((It's in the Northern lands. There's a brage--Argo--leaving there for it.))<br>
<br>
((thank you))<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
As the barge hit land, Anck-su-namun awoke. She walked off the Argo and went up the hills. There she saw a large village of women, and eargerly walked up to them. Touching one on the shoulder, she showed them the knife.<br>
<br>
((That's Gwen's knife. How have you come to own it??))<br>
<br>
((I don't know.))<br>
<br>
The woman eyed her and asked<br>
<br>
((What's your name??))<br>
<br>
((Anck-su-namun..who are you??))<br>
<br>
The woman brushed back her blonde hair, and said<br>
<br>
((Alysia.))<br>
<br>
Anck-su-namun smiled. Her name seemed familiar. She look at Alysia and said<br>
<br>
((I have no where to go.))<br>
<br>
Alysia looked back at her and said<br>
<br>
((I had a premonition that Gwen died. I know now that she did, b/c no one could ever get that knife away from her and live to tell about it. Look, you're smiling. You knew her somehow. You have her aura. You look like her as well. Would you take Gwen's place??))<br>
<br>
((Yes))<br>
<br>
Alysia smiled and took Anck-su-namun's hand<br>
<br>
((come on then. Dinner's about to start.))<br>
