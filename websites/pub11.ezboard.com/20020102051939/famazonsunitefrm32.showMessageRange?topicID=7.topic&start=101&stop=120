&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He turned storming off into the battlefield on the back of his black steed. His large grizzly bear staying next to Hippolyte incase of emergency.

Still charged head long towards the opposing side his teeth clenched together as he looked upon the hordes of enemy. His spear tip lowered towards the ground as he road on, the dogs that attacked him were soon impaled. He cast the spear aside once he had finished with the dogs near him. His horse leaping through the row on flames the god had created.   He pulled another spear, as he became one of the first in the charge hurling his weapon towards Poseidon. His hand reaching for another spear as he continued on.. <br>

But, the older amazon was not so quick to rush in...she was cautious.  She had not had enough time to see and calculate all the enemy had offered.  The auburn haired amazon was not the daughter of Ares for nothing.  <br>
She had heard the words of Pentesilea and blinked.  She had barely known the amazon queen and now those words left her a bit shook up.  <br>
Then Alastor had told of his promise..and it was a bit of comfort.  Even if she was unsure of the large bear that stayed near her side.  Like a general in a war...Hippolyte began to direct amazons on the attack.  She was not about to let these attackers gain one bit of ground..not amazon lands.<br>

His golden hair bounced back and forth as he shook his head. He placed a gaunleted hand upon both of their shoulders. He smiled his breath-taking smile and giggled a bit.<br>
<br>
&quot;A war is a war, just like a kiss is a kiss dearest Aphrodite. Both mean different things to different people. Both are expressions of passion. In many ways, Love is War. But do not work yourself into a huff, this too shall pass.&quot; he planted a kiss onto her scarlet cheek. He nodded to Zephyr and backed up, slowly turning around walking to his chariot. He comforted the horses, petting the muzzle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Run fast. No Fear&quot; he whispered into his horses ear. <br>
<br>
Off of a golden table he took his feathered helmet. Raising it slowly over his head he placed it on. It was snug, but it fit. He fixed his quiver over his shoulders, along with his bow. He sighed and picked up his sword, placing in its sheath upon his belt.<br>
<br>
He walked slowly over to his chariot and boarded it, the gates closing behind him. He grasped the reigns and whipped them quickly. Taking in a deep breathe he began to scream a battle-cry from the north. His horses bucked, and he raised his right fisted arm in a pre-decided triumph. The sun glistened off of his golden armor, it was as if Apollo was trapped in time in that moment, it looked like a fine painting. But the moment was soon over, there was no turning back. The chariot was racing into the midsts of the batte field.<br>
<br>
Several times he pulled back his arrows, sending them flying soundlessly through the air. The only sound Apollo heard was the sound of arrow hitting metal, and immedietly after, metal hitting flesh. Apollo reached back into his quiver and pulled from it another golden arrow. He signaled for his horses to run straight forward toward a soldier whose own chariot was flying like bat out of hell towards Apollo's. Apollo secured the arrow within the bow and pulled back, closing one eye and whispering:<br>
<br>
&quot;Shoot far. Shoot true.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that the arrow was sent sailing through the air in a deafening silence until the inevitable &quot;crack&quot; of the metal and &quot;thwap&quot; of the flesh.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn it.&quot; Apollo uttered as he had missed the poor man's heart by a few inches. He would now have prolonged suffering, which is what Apollo tried to avoid by sending a death-blow to the heart. But he hadn't time to worry about such things now. He had a battle to fight.<br>
<br>
Apollo prepared another bow when something totally unexpected happened. He saw a spear hurdling towards his chariot. It struck. It was to late. The spear had wedged itself into the wheel of the chariot. The sound of cracking wood filled the air as Apollo found himself flying through the air.<br>
<br>
CRASH! He hit a tree. Apollo opened his eyes to find everything around him churning like the ocean. Grasping his head he removed his helmet. His eyes fell upon his assailent. Suddenly his vision was cured and he was filled with a vindictive rage like no other on the battlefield. Apollo set out for his attacker, without chariot and without helmet. He didn't care at this point, he saw and tasted blood.<br>
<br>
Many tried to stop him from reaching his goal, an officer of this joke of an army. But all they met was the unmerciful blade of his sword and the unpalatable taste of death. Apollo was seeing red as he stormed across the battlefield, taking down soldier after soldier. Finally he was eye to eye with his attacker.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahahaha foolish Apollo! All &quot;Knowledgeable&quot; god of whining and a lot of NOTHING. You poor pointless little coddled mother's boy.&quot; a smirk rode across the man's bearded face. Arrogance shined in his eyes, the very breathes he took seemed to whisper &quot;arrogance&quot;. Apollo stood silent as he sized up his opponent and drew his sword once again, it covered in the blood of the man's kinsman.<br>
<br>
&quot;BING&quot; &quot;CHIME&quot; the sound of metal against metal filled the fields with the battling of Apollo and this nameless wonder. Apollo had been bested by the man several times, but Apollo was catching on. He must calm himself if he wished to vanquish this fiend. Apollo took a deep breathed and opened his mind. This was going to be over. Soon.<br>
<br>
The long metal blade came whistling down as Apollo just stepped out the way and slashed at the back of the man's knee's. The man fall to the ground screaming in pain. Apollo  grabbed him by the head and spoke out to those who could hear.<br>
<br>
&quot;BEFORE YOU IS A PRIME EXAMPLE...OF WHAT COMES TO THOSE WHO SHALL CHALLENGE THE GREAT APOLLO. MORE IMPORTANTLY, THIS IS WHAT SHALL COME TO THOSE WHO CHALLENGE THE AMAZON'S. DO HEED MY WARNING ON THIS DUSTY AFTERNOON AND CEASE THIS FOOLISHNESS, FOR CONTINUING IS POINTLESS.&quot;<br>
<br>
And with that Apollo raised his sword above his head and split the man's skull. Red. There was red everywhere. It was as if the ground around Apollo had been covered in apple peals, but it was the middle of November, no such things would happen. Blood. It tasted bitter-sweet as it dripped into Apollo's mouth, mixing with his own. He heaved for air. Vengence tasted sweet, victory even sweeter, but the man's blood was bitter as only the essense of a man with no morals could be.<br>
<br>
Apollo spit. He walked away from the split body covered in the man's blood. Drawing his sword he continued into the thickets of the battlefield. This was far from over. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/umobellerophon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MO Bellerophon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/19/01 9:25:22 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/alteredsoulsx/images/bellerophon-05.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...

He was almost hypnotized by the movements of both gods and amazons. He quickly snaps out of it as Pegasus shifts underneath him. He hadn't imagined there would be gods pitted against each other,but either way he wanted a piece of the action,for this battle would be a memorable one.<br>
<br>
Reaching to his right he grabs hold of his cross bow,and a silver pointed arrow.As he loads the arrow he whispers to Pegasus. &quot;Steady&quot; As Pegasus steadys himself he takes aim at a (nameless) amazon. He pulls back the trigger fireing the arrow which soars across the field until embedding deep into the chest of the amazon,the force of the arrow so strong,causing the amazon to jerk back instantly at contact and fall dead.<br>
<br>
A tight grin pulls on the corners of Bellerophons lips as he watches the impact of the arrow,he then places the cross bow back in its place,and pulls his sword out clutching it with his left hand,his right hand grasping Pegasus' reigns,he raises his sword into the air,at which point Pegasus Grunts and rears up,the steeds wings expanding fully.It was beautiful.But lasted only for a short moment as Pegasus flaps those large wings causing gusts of air to blow back anyone or anything that was in thier range.With each flap of those wings Pegasus pulled himself and his master into the air. With a nudge of his heels and a tug on the reigns Bellerophon directs Pegasus out into the battle.<br>
<br>
Soaring above the battle,Bellerophon peers down at the opposers,until his attention is directed to a brave amazon who had made it past the killer dogs and avenging gods. Pegasus hovers in one spot above the field,his wings continuously causing gusts of wind to blow back any oppresser or atleast hold them back for a time,but this one amazon managed to fight against the gust of air and swing her mighty sword fiercly at Bellerophon and his mount. Pegasus snorts and grunts as the grand steed swoops back away from the amazon,only to be nudged hard in the ribs and forced once again forward by his master. <br>
<br>
The sounds of metal against metal rang against Bellerophons ears as he blocked each of the amazons blows with his sword before finding an opening and drawing his sword back then quickly forward and across,taking the amazons head clean off her shoulders.

His eyes then glow and surge with power as he bores a whole into Alastor with his eyes.<br>

As Alastor heads his way Poseidon stands his ground and spreads his feet a little wider than shoulder width apart. His sandles dig into the ground and his muscles grow taught.

The attack continues as he leaves his hand outstretched, palm out, smaller balls of energy fly to the horse at blinding speeds.:: <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uvvvthegoddesshecatevvv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VVV The Goddess Hecate VVV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/20/01 3:05:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...

A soft touch was brushed across the shoulders of the beast and she looked up into the eyes of Hera.  It was understood, Sin rushed down into the fields straight towards a pack of hounds.   Fang bared, claws stretched, she slashed at the hounds as they turned to attack the large cat.  Her roars could be heard by many sending chills down their spins.  It was a blood curling roar of blood lust, as the huntress sunk her teeth deep into the back of a hound and held it in her teeth as she was nipped suddenly on the quarters by another.   Six hounds were in a storm of attacks upon the lioness, but soon with the crack of bones and necks, she soon was down to four. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 496<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/20/01 3:41:10 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...

Her scimitar held in hand became a whirl of action as her eyes were set to the enemy.  Down it came as the horse raced in a wild fury.  Scimitar meeting the soldiers as they moved towards the amazon queen.  She did not stop to see what the blade did as the small woman slashed at the on coming masses.  Hippolyte had become the stampeding horses as her name stated.  Crushing foot soldiers under the hooves of her mare, and sending them to the bloody ground with her scimitar. <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

He continues to hold his enemy at bay,clanging his sword against the spear tip each time it came close to Pegasus or himself.<br>
<br>
But,He is suddenly knocked back as he recieves an arrow in his left shoulder.Losing his grip on the reign he falls back off of his winged steed,and plumets at-most 15 feet to the ground. Landing with a loud thud. &quot;Argh!&quot; He cringes in pain as he lands on his back,but quickly gains his sences as that tall amazon charges at him,plunging her sword toward his midsection. He quickly brings his sword up slicing the head of the spear off its shaft,then with another quick motion he jams the tip of his sword into the amazons gut.Lifting his left leg his kicks the amazon off his sword who then falls back,dead.<br>
<br>
Pegasus then lands swifty at his masters side,wings still open at full,the steed snorts and kicks at any on coming threat while Bellerophon stays down for the moment.<br>
<br>
Looking around quickly he keeps a watchful eye open for any threat and for the one who nailed him with an arrow. Seeing Pegasus holding back anyone,he takes hold of the arrow and snaps the shaft off with a wince,then tossing the arrow aside.<br>
<br>
Once gaining his sences fully,he stands up,grabbing hold of Pegasus' reigns and hoists himself back onto the saddle,and just as quickly as he mounted,Pegasus liftes them both back into the air.... <p>-=¤ Bellerophon ¤=-</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenhera.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Queen Hera</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 170<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/20/01 4:50:07 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/qhera.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...

Attempting to hold back her powers and allow the amazons to fight off the enemy was not easy.  Then as Hera watched those amazons she was most close to charge into the bloodbath, her heart raced.  Sin's wish to join the fight was not hard to allow.  Hera, herself, was becoming harder to keep at bay.<br>
Slender pale fingers clenched into fists at either side of her black glittering gown.  White teeth bit hard together under slim red lips, and icy blue eyes watched with anger as amazons fell.  Even if the male soldiers fell...it was nothing to be joyous over.  Her heart sunk as she could feel each amazon who breathed their last breath.  How dare her brother attack the amazons?!  What did Poseidon think he had to prove?

It took her a few minutes to realize that the amazon had nearly dispenced with most of her hounds. her face took on the emotion of dissatifaction as she forced another arm to sprout from the thick dark metal that incased her body actting as a superior armor than what was worn by most on the battle feild and in the blink of an eye her third arm riped open another pouch but this time no dust fell, rather a million ravens with rasor shape beaks poured from her charriot as they littered the sky. <br>

Her third arm fummble through more pouches opening up another small one with relase even more ravens to prey upon the amazons, the only difference was these raven have two heads and four feet which meant to the amazons and their horses twice the pestilance.<br>
