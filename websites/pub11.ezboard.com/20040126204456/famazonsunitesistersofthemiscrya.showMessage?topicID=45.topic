The small queen went to grab her leather cloak..only to find it had not dried yet.  She frowned and decided to put on her old warrior leathers..already worn and dark. The rain would not hurt those.  And she certainly would not melt. Then grabbed an old robe to keep her arms warm.  With that done, she kissed the still sleeping Gabby and Theseus.  Then stepped out into the light rain.  She walked to the barn and grabbed Monsoon..saddled her up...and then rode out of Themiscrya.  She headed to the tavern..til she got to the place she had seen the woman.  She frowned..as she had already known that the woman's footsteps would be washed away with the weather.  She turned Monsoon and headed up the mountain.  Half way up..she she came to the rugged rocky face of the mountain.  Tieing Monsoon to a tree..she looked about.:::: <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

She searches for any signs of a trail.  But, none appear thanks to the rain, that still falls lightly upon the queen.  As she climbs the cliff..she begins to feel weak.  And sits down to rest.

Instinct takes over and Ara jumps down the cliff..landing 10 feet from the woman.  The wolf growls at her...and Ara looks at it with her warm brown eyes.  She makes an odd sound..sounding almost like a low whirring sound.  The wolf cocks his head curiously and allows Ara to move towards the woman.  The dark woman kneels down beside the paler one.  She rips a piece of the burgandy cap that the woman wears and makes a tourniquet around the wound.  And then lifts up the woman, and not w/ out a bit of struggle.  She carries her up to the small cave, out of the rain.  Making a pillow of the rest of the burgandy cape, and then covering her w/ Ara's own cloak.  Sensing that the woman warrior is still asleep. Ara quickly goes to work.  Out of her pouch she pulls a bone needle and stitching.. laceing up the wound.  Then she pulls out a black jar.  Dipping her fingers into it..she pulls out a grey substance, which she smears upon the stitched wound.  She then rises from beside the pale warrior and moves to the otherside of the cave..and leans against the wall.

She did not want to seem to step over any bounderies of royalty.  Ara had seen a Queen before, in Egypt.  And had noticed that all the Queen's subjects never stepped beside or in front of her when walking.  So, respectively, Ara walked behind a bit.  As she did she watched Hippolyte.  She had never seen a Queen who dressed as a warrior before.  Actually, she had not seen many women warriors.  Only one that she could think of, and that was Livia in Rome.  But, this Warrior Queen seemed to be at peace.  And almost mothering, with a concern for Ara.  It made her think of her mother, Boali.  She missed her mother very much.  They had been so close.  But, she knew her mother would not be happy with her, for the people she had wounded in Rome.  There was nothing she could do, she told herself.  She glanced at the wolf who walked beside them.  The wonders never seemed to stop.  She knew animals could teach humans.  And they were our brothers.  But, never had she seen one actually heal someone.  Ara turned her eyes to the path before them.  It seemed to grow smaller and thick in vines, trees, and bush.  She wondered just where Hippolyte was taking her.  Well, she told herself that she could trust her.  For she needed to be able trust someone.  With that she sighed.  She wanted her family back.::: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=scynthianwolf>Scynthian Wolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#993300>(9/29/00 4:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Viewing Themiscrya</span><hr size=1> ::He felt Ara's eyes upon him.
