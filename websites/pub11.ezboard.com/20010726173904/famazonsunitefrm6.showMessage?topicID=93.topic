She had gone off to Ephesus to give her friend Ariah gifts from Scynthia. She then stopped at Eli's Temple to gather things for the baby's birth but instead the baby decided to be born there. <br>
<br>
It took many weeks to clean up the aftershock of the war between the Alternate Universe, but the village looked better than new. The cold weather had already passed and the rivers and streams were already melting. The amazons had been preparing for Spring all the time that Aly was gone.<br>
<br>
As a large fire was lit, the gates were closed. This was a special event and no men or non amazons were allowed in. The moon was full and the amazons were dancing happily by moonlight near the fireside. They chanted and danced for hours not caring whether or not they had to stop anytime soon. Drinks were made and the sisters gathered together to drink with oneanother in sisterhood. A few animals were hunted and prepared as a feast for the tribe.<br>
<br>
The gates were slowly opened and upon her black stallion, Alysia rode in through the village. She rasied her arm in a shouting welcome to her sisters.<br>
<br>
&quot;Amazons Unite!&quot;<br>
<br>
They all cheered along with her. The wolf pack, one by one entered the village and lined themselves up creating a pathway to Alysia's throne that sat before the entire village. She smiled and taking her new bundle in her arms, she walked down the path and stood up before her entire tribe and yelled.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Atmah has returned home!&quot;<br>
<br>
They all new that the child was the reincarnation of the Atmah.<br>
<br>
&quot;This war has brought to us a great gift dear sisters. For the Atmah said she would never return without glory to the tribe to lead her through. No tribe in the history of Scynthia has ever overcomed such trials. We are Amazons! We are the glory and the Nation shall grow strong! And now, I would like, before we get back to drinking. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
She smirked looking to one of the sisters near the bar.<br>
&quot;By the way make me an ale while I'm talking.&quot;<br>
<br>
A few amazons laughed and Alysia gave a small chuckle herself.<br>
<br>
&quot;I would like each of you to welcome the newest amazon princess into the tribe. If you have the power to bless, please do so, not because she is my daughter, but because she is your fellow sister. We want all amazons to prosper in this great land.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled as she lay her baby girl on a small alter before the throne and placed before her a braided amazon band to be placed in her hair when she grows older.<br>
<br>
&quot;My sweet baby girl, may the Gods bless you in your times of need. May you grow to become an amazon princess and make your tribe stronger. May you take with you the skills that each of these women can give to you. May you take in your heart the wisdom and light of your father, even he the Devi and Avatar. I call you now by name. . . Vyiana Cyane Loire, Amazon Princess and Messanger of Love.&quot; <br>
<br>
She took her child in arms and held her for the tribe to see. <br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome our new sister!&quot;<br>
<br>
The amazons cheered greatly with pride knowing that they had reached glory in the village and in their hearts.<br>
<br>
One by one, each of the amazons came towards Alysia leaving gifts for the child Princess and blessing her with greatness in the amazon tribe.<br>

Everyone knew the main blessing Dawn would pass on, and it was honor to recieve guidence in that light. Taking a dagger to Dawn's palm, she sliced it open, the crimson liquid flowing into a droplet on the baby.<br>
<br>
 &quot;May the Gods carry you with guidence. And when you grow stronger.. I will garentee I'll train you just as well as the rest of these gals.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn laughed lightly, and handed the dagger across the Aly.<br>
<br>
 &quot;You know the drill. When she grows older.. I will train her, by order of the Queen..and father..of course.,,&quot;<br>
<br>
 With that the Amazon snapped her fingers, and scream of shrill agony echoed through the village, and then the roar of a tiger, and then as a blessing an ity bitty demonic tiger appeared next to the baby girl, using its pink tongue to lick the blood off of her forehead.<br>
<br>
 &quot;This tiger will forever protect her, that is my blessing&quot;<br>

Vyiana reached her hands up at the tiger and laughed as it continued to lick her hands. She smiled and giggled as she ran her fingers through its fur.<br>

&quot;She will grow to be a strong amazon I promise this.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ulacacora.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LaCa Cora</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#993300>(3/15/01 5:34:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=93.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Queen has Returned!!</span><hr size=1> Cora stepped up carefully, not just from the weight of the unborn child, but more from a sudden change in her humours that caused her to seem very desolate.  Yet she was thrilled with her newest sister, and would therefore provide her best.<br>
<br>
Placing her hand gently onto Vyiana's forehead. &quot;Little sister, when the time comes, my most important wish is that you will take my place, as Amazon Princess of Scnythia. You will be worthy, Vyiana, for as Velasca blessed me, I shall bless you.  May the strength of our Mother, Velasca, and my father, Hercules, and the wisdom and compassion you will be given, quide through to the end.&quot; She couldn't afford a smile. It was true.  She felt it was better that Vyiana took her place, for she belonged in Rome--no matter how much Alastor hated it--and she belonged to the Fates.  They would no longer allow her to stand the Amazon way of life.<br>
<br>
Leaning down to kiss Vyiana's forehead, she stepped back carefully, setting a shaking hand on her mother's shoulder. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualiyakinneas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AliyaKinneas</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#993300>(3/15/01 7:16:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=93.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=C:\America Online 6.0\download\Ali8.bmp></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Queen has Returned!!</span><hr size=1> Aliya walked up next to Cora and put a hand on her shoulder, smiling as best she could. She, too, knew all too well what it was like to belong to something that couldn't allow you to be a full Amazon. And she knew what it was like to need Rome. It was in her blood- it couldn't be helped. She placed a hand on Vyianna's forhead and a green mist danced above her. &quot;Vyianna, the oracle of Delphi and I bless you.

Gwendolyn, hearing the noise, jumped out of bed and awoke her brother Sheftu from his sleep.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sheftu, she's back! She's back!&quot;<br>
<br>
Sheftu nodded his reply and went back to sleep. Gwen ignored him and ran to her friend Voletta. violetta awoke immediatley.<br>
<br>
Gwen grabbed the jeweled eye of Horus she had been keeping so long, and ran from her home to the Queen jumping up and down in happiness.<br>
<br>
Alysia did the same and said, &quot;I'm happy to see you again, Gwendolyn. Who is that you have there?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, this is my friend, Violetta. She's considering joining the tribe along with my brother Sheftu. But he's asleep.&quot;<br>

Alysia smiled, &quot;I'm very glad to hear we have people ready to join.&quot;<br>

&quot;If they want to, they will. I'm sure they'll contact you.&quot;<br>
