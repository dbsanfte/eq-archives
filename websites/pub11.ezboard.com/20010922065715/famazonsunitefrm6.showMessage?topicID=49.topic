She thought for sure they would have attacked somewhere else first. As the Centaurs charged through the gates of Scynthia, a pack of fifty wolves were there to greet them. The Centaurs numbered at about 150. At least 12 were killed by the wolves and perhaps 20 wounded. But they kept comming. Alysia yelled loudly as some of the amazons came running at the sound. The Village looked deserted. The Centaurs grinned as they saw the sall number of the amazon army. Alysia had fear in her eyes. She glanced at the small number of her amazons and as the Centaurs closed in through the trees getting closer Alysia yelled, &quot;Coo Coo, Coo Coo!&quot; Which was the generall term for an amazon retreat. At least that was what the Centaurs thought. As they saw the few amazons run back away from them, nearly fifty dropped from the trees with swords in their hands stabbing at the horse men. Others came out from under the waters at the surrounding ponds.More amazons actually appeared comming out of their huts on foot while the rest came out from the hills charging full speed at the Centaurs on horseback. Alysia grinned as she pulled out her daggers and held them as if they were sais.

<br>
Finally, after Aylsia had drawn the centaurs farther towards the hiding amazons, Sartha sees the perfect target and gets to her feet, jumping onto the back of a centaur and sending her sword into his back. The centaur rears with a scream of pain and Sartha is thrown from his back, but not before pulling her sword out. She lands rudely on the ground, wincing slightly, but watching the injured centaur continue to run, determined to finish what she started. Without another hesitation, Sartha leaps back to her feet and charges into battle:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=queenalysia>Queen Alysia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen</span><br>  Posts: 129<br> <font color=#993300>(11/29/00 4:53:42 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> With Daggers in Hand. . .</span><hr size=1> Alysia growled fiercly with a dark grin upon her face.

<br>
  The first unfortunate to cross her path was a large, ugly, greasy looking centaur(Ew). He had cut her off and had begun to swung his sword at her.

She stood at the very corner, watching each of the centaurs in turn..one coming from one side and one from the other. She glanced above her and noticed a low limb.  In not even a fraction of the last second, she dropped her sword, jumped up grabbing the limb and tucked her legs under her.  The centaurs ran into each other, both scouring the other on his drawn sword.<br>
<br>
    Suddenly a child-like scream rang out and Cora's head whipped to the side.  Julian had been captured by a very large centaur, who was dragging him away from the battle.  Cora's fears and worries all sprang out at once as she dropped from the limb, grabbed the two centaurs swords and ran in the direction of the large centaur, screaming her grievances.<br>
<br>
    The centaur must have seen, or heard, her coming, because he dropped the young Julian off in a cage that was set aside and galloped to meet the crazed Amazon head on.<br>
<br>
    Being a mother, naturally her first concern was her child.  Cora began to attack the centaur in the most violent and protective way.  The swords she had taken swung about irratically.  Unfortunately, this centaur was not un-skilled.  He met each swing with a block, then reared back and kicked her in the stomach, sending her back.<br>
<br>
    Cora hit a tree and slid down,dropping the swords.  It took her a second or two to recover from the blow, but standing was a task.  She was dizzy.  She saw three of that centaur now..but that wasn't about to stop her. <br>
  <br>
    The rest of the battle was oblivious to her.  Grabbing up one of the swords....she charged at the centaur. Cora must have misjudged the distance, she ran right by him.<br>
 <br>
    He whirled around just as she began to make a U-turn and smacked her with the butt of his sword, knocking her down again.  Cora fell with a small cry.  The gruesome centaur stood over her, preparing for his next, and possibly last, strike.<br>
<br>
   Cora's eyes widened...and she rolled over just as the sword came down.  It did more than graze her side.  She got up unsteadily, grabbing her side with one hand, and with the other, thrust her sword into the surprised Centaurs belly.<br>
<br>
  The centaur fell.<br>
<br>
  Cora dropped the sword..swaying a little.  She was bleeding.  And dizzy. She turned to find her son, but all she saw was a bunch of blurry images.  Then she fell into the dirt.<br>

&quot;Never ever treat me so sire!&quot; Shey yelled.  :Turning she stabbed her sword into the centaur to make sure it was dead, then regained her dagger, tucking it neatly in her boot, it was then that she realized that she would die if she did not have a mount, she ran to the side woods and whistled as hard as she could.  A large black wolf stopped in front of her and panted happily.:::: &lt;you called grandma?&gt;  Shey smiled at her friend(the white wolf) Anya's five year old pup beant down for her to mount, shey smiled and jumped on:: ready for a hunt? ::the wolf howled in reply and plunged into the battle::<br>

She had quickly adorned herself in her old Amazon Shamaness attire, quickly recovered her sword, and the chakram that was given to her by a GC, and hurried toward her Sisters. As she arrived, the battle had already started, she growled loudly, and eyed two Centuars who were charging after Cora, who was badly injured. She leaped into the air, and that fierce warcry, similar to the Warrior Princess' herself, was heard all throughout the village.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alilililililililililiiiiiiiiiteeeeeeyaaaaaah!&quot;<br>
<br>
She landed in front of the two, drawing her sword, grinning wickedly. &quot;Hey boys!&quot; The two centaurs turned around to face Meg, and she motioned them with a hand. &quot;Come and GET SOME!&quot; As the charged toward her, she rammed her sword in the ground, and right when they came, she jumped up, and kicked both of them in the stomach, and grabbed a broken spear that layed next to her. She fought fiercly with the &quot;staff&quot;, and twirled, bringing the staff around, and hitting the centaur in his knee cap, breaking his leg, and she did it to the other one. She grabbed her sword, and jabbed it into his, chest, growling, as she eyed the other, she noticed he was again going after Cora. She screamed, and flipped in front of Cora. <br>
<br>
&quot;Didn't your mother ever teach you it's rude to hit a lady while she's down?!&quot; She jumped up, and kicked him in the chest, continuously, before flipping backward, and landing on his back, taking his head in her hands, and breaking his neck.<br>
<br>
&quot;CORA!&quot; She flipped off the carcus off the centaur, and landed next to her. &quot;Cora? Are you all right?&quot;<br>

<br>
The centaur tried to stay standing but only ended up straining himself,and he fell to all four knees.With that Kala raised her sword,ready to plunge it into the centaurs chest.Just then she froze questioning her intent.<br>
<br>
Kala was suddenly broke out of her thoughts when she felt a sharp pain course through her left shoulder.She spun around to see a Centaur reloading his Bow then fireing once again.Just as the centaur fire his bow,she lept up into the air,the arrow barely missing her,then plunging itself into the fallen centaurs chest,killing him instantly.Kala landed just a few feet from the shooting centaur and quickly knelt down pulling a dagger from her right boot,and throwing it into the chest of the shooting centaur.The shooting centaur fell to his side,gasping for air,not dieing instantly.Kala made her way to the fallen centaur and plunged her sword deep into his chest,piercing his heart and killing him,putting him out of any misery.<br>

Before diving back into the battle,she reached her left hand to her back and snapped the the arrow that was piercing her shoulder in half,then tossed it aside,leaving only the a fraction of the arrow in her shoulder.<br>
