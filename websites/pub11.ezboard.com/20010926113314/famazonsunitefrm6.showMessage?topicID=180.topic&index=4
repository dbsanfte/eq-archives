Hippolyte had not known of the kind that their Northern Athelfi were at war with.   So, she and her athelfi were ready for anything.  <br>
<br>
Then she stopped the small group..raising a hand up.  She could hear thundering hooves not far from them. Cocking a brow, Hippolyte looked to Anippe.  With a flick of her wrist and just a look, she had sent Anippe on to check out the noise.  The amazons sat silently upon their horses.  It was not long before Anippe returned and rode up beside her Queen.  <br>
<br>
&quot;It is our Northern Athelfi, my Vasilissa,&quot; she reported in a hushed voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well, let us join Alysia's army,&quot; Hippolyte spoke and then nodded to those who had remained with her.  The amazons quickly rode in the direction of Alysia's tribe.<br>
<br>
As they reached them, the band stopped as Hippolyte gave a signal to the warriors of Alysia's tribe that they were truly Amazons.  Then she urged her mare and rode up to Alysia.  Dropping her reigns, she saluted her athelfi.  &quot;Yasoo, Alysia. I am sorry it has taken so long.. I hope we have not missed much,&quot; Hipp gathered a crooked grin as her brown orbs twinkled at Alysia. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualysiaofscynthia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alysia of Scynthia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 192<br> <font color=#993300>(8/21/01 5:13:55 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Approaching her Athelfi . . . </span><hr size=1> Alysia rode her white mare up to the Themiscryan Warriors.

&quot;I have a feeling that we won't be the ones attacking. Nevertheless, we keep riding.&quot;<br>

Alysia was full of hate and pain. This kind of Darkness hadn't risen in her since she rode with Livia, or perhaps the first Centaur war that took place near Themiscrya. Where she and Dawn fought along side eachother. <br>

She looked back towards her other sisters.<br>

She pulled out the map from her belt, the one she had takn from Alysia' hut. The spots representing the lizard people were forming troops that were already leavin the Saurian villages beyond the valleyand over the tall hills. But something else made her brows crinkle in confusion. There was an array of Saurian dots that had just left one of the other amazon villages. <br>
<br>
Her eagle, Eyes, suddenly gave her a vision of the destruction done to that Amazon Village at midnight in full animation before giving her the final result of the destruction as it looked now along with a single... black flag with a picture of the sun.. blocked out by the Dark moon with three slash marks across it.... an eerie sight. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh gods...&quot; she muttered as her eyes went from the eagle's dark blues to her own shimmering browns.<br>
<br>
She looked over at Alysia. &quot;Alysia! Saurian spies just caused destruction in the Amazon Village of the Amazons of the Sacred Circle at midnight! They've already left it for the ravaging beast of the forest!&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked back at her animated map. &quot;They are a very large number, Alysia! We must be cautious and fearless.&quot; She rolled the parchment and rode along with the two queens at the head of the group, making their way across the valley. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualysiaofscynthia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alysia of Scynthia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 193<br> <font color=#993300>(8/21/01 9:03:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Amazons of the Sacred Circle</span><hr size=1> Alysia listened to Delilah's words before she was struck with more rage in her heart. The Saurians had killed sisters from her own tribe, and now they were after the others. She closed her eyes and sighed lightly saying a small prayer to the Ancients for her sisters.<br>
<br>
She turned her horse to face her army of athelfi before she spoke. <br>
<br>
&quot;I want those of you who doubt yourselves to turn back now.&quot;<br>
<br>
She had true hate in her eyes. Those who knew her when she was younger, could see the old Alysia returning. Every moment, she was becomming more and more like the Samsara that she was.<br>
<br>
&quot;Our sisters have been killed! And I want vengeance!&quot; She yelled.<br>
<br>
She looked at Gabrielle sadly, and sighed remembering her fallen sisters at Helicon. She had hoped Gabrielle wouldn't mind Alysia repeating the speach at Helicon. She felt it was needed, encouragement was needed here.<br>
<br>
&quot;Our fallen sisters, our foremother, their blood was shed by the Saurian scum. Our sisters have died but death is not an end to their spirits.  Death it's a pathway to an afterlife.  And when it is my time to join them I want to know that I can grasp them by the hands I can look them all in the eyes and tell them that their blood was not shed without purpose that we finished the job that they began.  More of us may die today but the Amazon nation it will live on forever.  That is the duty that we carry and the everlasting honor that we will hold.&quot;<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Delilah had been given vision by Eyes, a little girl on her dog back in the village... and it looked as if she wanted to join the Amazons. That wasn't such a good idea to her and she knew it, but the girl couldn't also just sit in that village in the case that a Saurian might somehow get into the village and capture her. Her tiger knew what she was about to do and had shot up it's speed immediately. She clicked her tongue twice and the tiger's form and Delilah herself where sucked into a green light that vanished only to reform itself back in the village, Delilah on the tiger sped out of it quickly.<br>
<br>
The green light was like a portal that would only sit for a minute so Delilah needed to do what needed doing and get in there quickly. Her tiger approached the girl and her dog quickly and as they came up to them both, Delilah quickly leaned to the side and down, using both arms to grab the dog and Evelyn and hold them infront of her, muttering at them both, casting a seating charm on them so they wouldn't fall off the horse until she removed it. The tiger had already turned itself around sharply and headed for the green portal and dived into it. The green light vanished from that spot and returned to the clearing in the valley where Del and the tiger had first vanished.<br>
<br>
The green light was now gone and Del still kept hold of the girl, the dog would be fine where it sat. &quot;You will regret that you wanted to watch or participate in this war, my dear. It really isn't something for you to see, but now you get to.&quot; She smiled kindly though she wasn't exactly happy, seeing that there was a war at hand. The tiger slowed it's speed so it would match that of the other horses.<br>
<br>
So there Delilah rode, on her tiger with a girl and a dog infront of her each having somehow enough space not to be squished. When the time came, Del would make sure these two were safe away from the Saurians, but could still watch and not participate. <br>

And the Amazons will always prevail, including today.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ulatraariah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LaTra Ariah</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=C:\America Online 6.0\download\moonicon.bmp BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#993300>(8/22/01 10:42:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ariah Arrives</span><hr size=1>      It had taken Ari longer than she thought. Her horse had sprained her ankle about three fourths of the way to Scynthia and she had to continue the rest of the way on foot. She's dressed in full combat gear. She wears a sword on a sheath on her back, one at her side and daggers are sheathed in numerous places, hidden and out in the open. She wears Ephesian war paint on her face and arms.<br>
     From person to person she glances, recognizing most of the Amazons, with a few new faces until finally she spots Alysia and runs over to her.<br>
     "Aysia! I'm sorry it took me so long to get here, but I'm ready for action. What do you need me to do?" <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uyoungevelyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Young Evelyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#993300>(8/22/01 11:40:14 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/evelynsaphros/images/evelyn-5.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> O.o</span><hr size=1> Evelyn took her attention off of Delilah long enough to look around.She saw all the amazons in thier war gear and masks,and somehow could feel the intensity of the situation around her.There hadn't been any fighting yet,but already Evelyn was wondering if she wanted to be here.Absent mindedly she stroked Scoobys big head,it made her feel safe that Scooby was there,though he was big and clumsy,he always seemed to protect her when she needed it.She also felt safe being with Delilah,even though Del had so quickly shown up and swepts her up on a very large tiger,which surprisingly had no problem with Scooby,and Scooby had no problem with the tiger.Strange.<br>
<br>
Getting tired of grasping her wooden sword,she slips it into the small belt around her waist.She then glances up at Delilah,then looks around again.Her eyes stopping when she sees Ariah pass by.&quot;Ariah!&quot;She yells,but it would probley be unheared with the noise of all the horses trotting around.And she pointed to Ariah as she looked up again at Delilah.<br>

No.. she had no problem with Scooby, and like Scooby had no problem with the tiger, the tiger had no problem with Scooby.<br>
<br>
She noticed to whom the girl was pointing. &quot;Yes... LaTra Ariah. Noble and brave,&quot; saying it loud enough for Evelyn to hear over the galloping horses. &quot;Here Evelyn, drink this. Don't want you dehydrated.&quot; She held out a wineskin full of cold, thirst-quenching water that happened to materialize in Delilah's grasp out of.. thin air. &quot;We'll be there very soon and I mustn't have you thirsty. Hold onto the wineskin and drink when needed. I will have you hidden some place safe nearby. You may not feel very fond of war after this one. I assure you, if you don't want to watch when it happens, you may close your eyes and sleep. Trust me.. you'll be fine.&quot; Her warm smile was reassuring, though her thoughts were on other things.<br>
<br>
This ride certainly wasn't a bumpy one since her tiger's sprint was very much like a glide, quite comfortable. She reached out and patted Scooby's head. &quot;You have a good companion, little girl.&quot; She clicked her tongue and her tiger sped up just a bit more. The tiger didn't look like it'd be getting tired anytime soon.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you get hungry, just say so.&quot; And with that they kept on riding at the front of the army of Amazons galloping forward towards the battle... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ulatraariah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LaTra Ariah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#993300>(8/23/01 12:10:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: O.o</span><hr size=1> Ariah blinked abit and twirled around.

Se brushed the hair that the wind had blown into her face away with her right had and contnued to glance around for anynone looking diectly at her.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=180.topic&start=21&stop=39>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessage?topicID=187.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessage?topicID=184.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=180.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.threadControl?topicID=180.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=180.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=180.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm32">The Mythical Odyssey<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm28">Amazon Sisters of Cremni<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitefrm30">Amazons of the Sacred Circle<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works<option value="amazonsunitefrm31">Amazon Language</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6>Amazons of the Northern Lands</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
