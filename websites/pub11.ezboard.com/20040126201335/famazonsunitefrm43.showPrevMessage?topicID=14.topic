When she heard someone knocking she quickly picked up her Sebastyan who was still sniffiling from recent cry.  She dashed as fast as her little legs could carry her to the door.<br>

Finally reaching the door, with her free hand, she eased it open so she could greet the visitor.  &quot;Yes, how may I help you?&quot;  A warm smile controled her features as always. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=empressxena142>EmpressXena142</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 214<br> <font color=#993300>(12/17/02 12:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ausxip.com/graphics/Xena/X49.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How may I help you?</span><hr size=1> *she smiled to the woman in front of her.*I was told by Yakut of the Northern Amazons that you are the person to go to if one wanted to hold a celebration for someone.

Dark tiger markings on her cheeks seem to cut through her hair, ending closely to her mouth.  Two pearl white feline fangs slightly peeked from behind her cherry lips.<br>
<br>
Her tiny bare feet slid across the floor as she took her step back to allow her guest to enter.  She also widened the door for her.<br>

Two chairs, carved out of wood, sat ontop of a doe fur rug.  Her chair was lower to the ground than the other, and was obviously made specially for her and the other was for visitors.  After taking her seat, she set Sebastyan down on the ground to crawl around.  With her left hand she motioned for Xena to take a seat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please have a seat my friend.&quot;  After the Amazon was comfterble, she started speaking again, &quot;I would be glad to help you with a celebration for Morrigan.  Tell me, when would you like to have this celebration.  If on the next full moon I have the perfect ritual to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sebastyan took a seat in the middle of the rug and began playing with a tiny white duck carved out of wood on wooden wheeles, tide to a little string allowing him to drag it along where he pleases.  He began making little noises, similar to what a bird would make.<br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;Well, I have a ritual that is slightly like the Pagan's puberty rite, but it is for a newborn.  It will require the assitance of Yakut.<br>
<br>
There are three roles of the ceremony that you, I, and Yakut will partake.  You will play the Mother role of coarse, I will be the High Priestess, and Yakut will be the crone.<br>
<br>
I shall be sending you a scroll of the ritual shortly, which will tell you what you will need to say during the ceremony and actions will be taken place.  It's a short ritual but with many things to say.<br>
<br>
Do you like the idea of it so far?  Oh, and one more thing, Xena, what is the goddess's name you wish we mention in it?  Yakut told me to use Artemis, is that right?&quot;<br>
<br>
She heard her baby make a soft coo and she moved her blue-green occulars down at him.  As her smile remained on her lips.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will need to find him a babysitter..&quot; her words escaped with a slight giggle.<br>
<br>
(( I am soooo sorry for the month's delay o_O;;; I had kinda fallen off the face of the earth.  But, I am back.  Ok, I need your email address to send you a copy of the ceremony.  I've already asked YakutMUN if she was ok with being in it, and she's agreed.  And again, I do apologise. Thank you for your patience. u_u; )) <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a
