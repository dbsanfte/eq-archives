Anyone who came near her,she abruptly wacked over the head with a blunt fist. On accident however,and underestimating her strength,she hit one roman too hard on the head,and crushed his skull. She blinked,and watched as blood gushed out of the romans mouth and nose,and his eyes pop out of his head. He died quickly,but Zelia was devistated at herself. She didn't mean to hit him that hard....<br>
<br>
Her lips quivered lightly,she didn't want to be in a war,because of the death she could cause,but she had made vows to Varia,and she would stand by her side no matter what,she just dreaded the idea of how Varia would react if Zelia started to lose her good essence...again.<br>
<br>
Once a roman soldier came toward her,she snapped out of her thoughts,and turned toward him,just intime for him to manage to cut her across the shoulder with his blade. She clasps a hand over the wound,and looks at him,not wanting to injure him,but he was more than ready to cause injurey to her and swung at her again with his sword. She easily side stepped,then quickly grabbed him by the shoulders of his armor,and lifted him off the ground,then threw him away from her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenvaria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QueenVaria</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://hometown.aol.com/variaavande/images/tsianina2.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 293<br> <font color=#993300>(2/21/02 3:15:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/variaavande/images/tsianina2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: blood Blood BLOOD!

She raised a brow at the cage he was holding,she then looked at Varia as the little myst thing be'd done.<br>
<br>
&quot;What the heck...?&quot; Looks straight to Fogstone just as he fled. If whatever he done to Varia in any way harms her,Zelia will personally see to his dimise.<br>
<br>
Then,she senced that familiar pressence of a god. Zelia was not a god herself,and because she can,and its in her instincts and nature,she can sence a god or goddess if they were anywhere near. She grunted,and huffed,then the feeling was gone,and she relaxed only slightly.<br>
<br>
As much as Zelia felt like bounding forward,and taking on an entire army at this moment,she remained at Varia's side,she trusted noone else to be at her side,and therefore,she remained at Vars side,and took on any of those romans who felt defiant enough to come near in a harmful way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualexisthesexy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alexis the Sexy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#993300>(2/22/02 1:00:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/variaavande/images/alexissm.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wha....</span><hr size=1> Alexis saw all the blood, and one would've expected him to get squeamish... which he DID!
