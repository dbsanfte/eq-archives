She walked through the lands, bundling herself up in the cloak she had bought before coming here; it was always cold in the North, no matter what. <br><br>As those blue eyes glanced about, she thought of what she was going to say to Aly when she saw her...she didn't know what it was, but something was drawing her back here. Something inside of her told her that something was different. Maybe it was that part of her that still felt a connection toward the Amazons....or maybe it was that last bottle of wine she polished off before coming here...either way, she had to figure out what it was.<br><br>She kept looking around, watching the trees. Her skills had long since left her after they were &quot;mysteriously&quot; given to her daughter, Cyane, but she didn't know if she was still welcomed in Amazon Lands or not...considering she wasn't an Amazon any longer...just a Barmaid.<br><br>&quot;...I hope the welcome wagon'll bring plenty to drink!

When Cyane was of age to aquire and understand those powers, they were taken away and given to Cyane by the Atmah.
