<br>
On foot, a woman clad in leather gear that much resembled callisto's, approached the amazon village. She had no visible weapons on her. Her long blonde hair was tied back into numerous braids. A few colorful feathers were tied in her braids as well. She stopped and looked behind her, but soon continued on to the amazon village.<br>
<br>
Naiba watched from the trees, knowing that whoever it was would not be able to see her. Not even Kalasin Ti’Ya-Kuk’Tai had been able to tell when she was around, and she was one of the best warriors in the world. After a moment of spying, she decided that if worst came to worst she could fight this woman, and so she jumped down from her perch.<br>
She held her spear out in front of her, pointing it neatly at the woman’s throat.<br>
<br>
“If you wouldn’t mind, “ she says timidly, as is quite normal, “Would you please tell me why you feel the need to come onto Amazon territory?”<br>
<br>
The woman wasn't startled she knew somewhere along the way there would be amazon spies. She stepped back away from the tip of the spear and brought her hands up over her head and clasped them together, showing she ment no harm to the amazons.<br>
<br>
&quot; I come because I am an amazon myself.&quot; She spoke with out a bit of fear in her words.&quot; I am the last of my tribe. My name is Penthesilea...&quot;<br>
<br>
She wasn't lying, to her knowledge, she was the last of her tribe. Not a nice story though.<br>
<br>
Naiba sighs, and slowly lowers her spear, though not totally standing down. She looked the amazon up and down, trying to figure out what to do with her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why are you in amazon territory?&quot;<br>
<br>
Penthesilea arched a brow.<br>
<br>
&quot;I've come to visit with my sisters. My tribe was so secluded, I really had no Idea how many other tribes there were.&quot;<br>
<br>
She glanced around.<br>
<br>
&quot;What tribe, may I ask, are you apart of?&quot;<br>
<br>
Naiba suddenly looks very shy, almost scared. She backs away from the young woman, her eyes are as wide as a doe. She looks from side to side, before looking at the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am a part of the Sisters of Honor.&quot; she whispers<br>
<br>
Penthesilea cocked her head slightlyto the side. <br>
<br>
&quot;The Sisters of Honor. Hmm, I'm afraid that's another new tribe to my ears.&quot; She chuckled a bit.<br>
<br>
She noticed that the woman before her changed her attitude a bit an was now more frightened.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is there something wrong?&quot; <br>
<br>
Penth turned around to make sure there wasn't some 10 foot, hairy gorgon monster behind her, or something. But soon turned back to face her with a puzzled look on her face.<br>
<br>
Naiba looks at her, she actually looks like she is about to bolt any moment. The woman wouldn’t know that Naiba was the most reclusive person in the tribe, and that even speaking to people made her nervous enough to go and hide. She takes a step back cautiously.<br>
<br>
“Please… please I didn’t mean to…” she is stammering, looking like she is about to have a panic attack<br>
<br>
Penthesilea relaxed her shoulders, and sort of leaned on one foot. She sratched her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, what didn't you mean to do?&quot; <br>
<br>
She hped she didn't scare the woman somehow. Excatly how could she, Penth seemed like a kind caring gentle soul. And that she was... Unless you got on her bad side. Her mentor was on that side. But hey, not this person.<br>
<br>
&quot; And, hey, I told you my name, what's yours?&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Naiba Indrani….&quot; She says and trails off, not looking up at all.<br>
Suddenly, a woman called Artemisia (NPC) Jumps out of the trees, sees the two women and smiles at the visitor.<br>
<br>
&quot;You'll have to excuse Naiba, she is somewhat of a recluse you could say.&quot;<br>
<br>
Penthesilea nodded to the new person.<br>
<br>
&quot;I see. Well Naiba, no need to feel timid around me, I was very shy in my tribe...when it was still around...<br>
<br>
She sighed.<br>
<br>
Naiba looks concerned.<br>
&quot;You're tribe was detroyed?&quot;<br>
<br>
Penthesilea nodded sadly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, it was. Attacked at night. Cowards they were not being able to face us in the light.&quot; <br>
She paused.  &quot;Most died, other's of my sisters were sold as slaves. I was too. But i refused to be a slave...So I was taught to be a fierce warrior by the man who bought me.&quot;<br>
<br>
She shruged.<br>
<br>
&quot;But enough about my past. I'm looking for the future.&quot; <br>
<br>
She smiled, only leaving one minor detail about who she was out, but hey it wasn't that she was a cold blooded murderer or anything!<br>

&quot;Look, I would love to be able to take you, but until I can have someone vouch for your story, I cannot, for the Sisters of Honor would not be too plaesed if I let the wrong person into the village.&quot; <p><center>
