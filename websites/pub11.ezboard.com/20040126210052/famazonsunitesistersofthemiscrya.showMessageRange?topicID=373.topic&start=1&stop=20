The albino's own voice echoed in her memories.  It hadn't been more than two nights since Lilith had rescued her from the Athens' prison sector. Two nights and she still felt the trees close in on her like cold stone.  It was hard to eat, even though there was plenty of food.  Her stomach rejected the trail meat before she even took a bite.  Finding freedom frustrating at first the assassin was well on her way to recovery.<br>
Lilith had suggested they camp until she was recovered enough to make the long journey back to Amazon lands.  Dosa glanced around the old tavern a day's ride outside of Athens with sadness. It was a good place to hide/rest, the old walls hadn't seen a human in years.  It must have been a grand place at one time.<br>
The albino spent her days curled next to the old hearth, staring into the darkness.  Her thoughts centered around her accuser, and the idea of going back.<br>
If she didn't go back, she could never return to Athens again.<br>
If she did go back, she might never return home to the Amazons again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=thermodosa>Thermodosa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#993300>(8/7/02 8:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=373.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/ithermodosa/017.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The hunt begins.</span><hr size=1> &quot;I can't go back, not until I find out who did this, and why.&quot; Her own words echoed in her mind as she went about getting familar with hunting once more.  She'd been given weapons from Lilith, even though her first attempt at using one again had resulted in the bandage binding her palm.<br>
<br>
A deer crossed her sites once more and again the albino didn't raise her bow, she only seemed to watch the creature she was hunting. The blank stare continued until the young doe was almost out of her view.  As if surfacing from a deep pool, the assassin drew her bow, took aim, and fired before the doe took one more step.<br>
<br>
Startled, the doe stared at the quivering end of the arrow that was sunk half shaft deep into the tree infront of her.  With a show of breath, and a snort of protest, the doe suddenly turned and ran the opposite way, leaving the albino behind.<br>
<br>
Thermodosa stood from her hiding place, ebon bow in hand and moved over to the arrow.  Wrapping her fingers around the shaft she lowered herself to one knee.  There was a time before, when the ablino wouldn't dare speak to this Goddess, yet time seems to heal all wounds, and all stubbornessess.<br>
<br>
&quot;Great Artemis, I dedicate this hunt to you. I hunger not for meat, let the spirt of the doe wild and free satisfy you.  I ask for your blessing on another hunt. My hunt isn't in the safety of your forests, it is in the deep stone city of your sister, Athena.  I ask you, I beg you, grant me swift legs to find my accusor, I beg for a clear mind to know when to act, and when to stay hidden.  I pray for your blessing in this hunt great Artemis.&quot;<br>
<br>
Drawing a pure arrow from the quiver at her hip, she lifted it in both palms as she lowered her head, eyes to the ground in submission, offering the only thing she had of value.  Her weapons, and the promise to hunt with honor, and the promise to kill with mercy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/urighteousrevenge.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RighteousRevenge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#993300>(9/6/02 11:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=373.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fortunecity.com/rivendell/chronos/478/untit.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> At the Inn</span><hr size=1> The old, tattered inn appeared to huddle around her and the small fire she'd started in the hearth.  The broken walls leaned in against her, seeming to steal the very air she breathed.  Stifled by four walls and her own oppressive thoughts, she could sit no longer.  <br>
<br>
Unearthly ice eyes flickered to the grimy windows, She paced her way over to them, solid arms crossed.  Brows furrowed she continued to glare at the sooty panes, as if she could see through them to find the amazon she knew was out on a hunt.<br>
<br>
The amazon's determination to return to Athens was more than unnerving.  The wildcat vixen had wasted months wandering, just in hopes of finding some remote clue to locating the treasured amazon.  Restless months of wandering had given her only slight reward and led her to the deepest pits of the Athenian jail.<br>
<br>
Discovering the amazon there was both an unimaginable horror and an incredible relief.  Some god somewhere must have favored them that day in their escape.  Well truthfully, she knew exactly which god was responsible for at least her success and put the matter aside with an ungrateful growl, to be contemplated at another time...and hopefully forgotten all together.<br>
<br>
Once outside of Athens, the only desire the grateful and much relived huntress had was to return with the amazon Thermodosa to the homestead they shared and take a much need to break.  She only wished for some time to recover peacefully from many long months of travel.<br>
<br>
But, Thermodosa said she needed to return and the vixen huntress would not abandon her now.  Weariness she would not allow the amazon to see, furrowed her brow, brining about the beginnings of another raging headache.  She paused a moment to brush fingertips over her temples as if they could wipe away the immanent pain.  <br>
<br>
Her idle pacing was brought to a halt before the fire once more, where she reluctantly settled herself.  She had sold off the majority of her belongings, the rest had been lost to many months on the road, to purchase a second horse for the amazon, but she had held on to her precious tea.  A cup was brewed from the softly flickering fire without much thought, and the soothing tea eased the beginnings of yet another headache.  Crouched by the hearth, the huntress dozed, in only to catch a few restless hours of sleep.<br>

The wildcat vixen's steely blue eyes flickered open to cast a sideways glance to the quickly dying fire.  Unearthly ice eyes darted around the perimeter of the room, banishing the horrible shadows of lingering dreams.<br>
<br>
The haze of sleep quickly disappeared and she shrugged away the stiffness of her cramped position.  She uncurled and almost easily found her feet.  With a distant yawn she started the mindless business of reviving the fire.<br>
<br>
The fire had returned to an almost cheery little blaze, finally banishing shadows and allowing the huntress to take her seat once more.  Idle icy eyes flickered through the corners listlessly.  They finally settled on the door, as if she could will the amazon to open it.<br>

Breathing heavy as if she'd just come from a mile long race she moved inside and closed the door quickly.  A wild look in her eyes turned the silver orbs a dark platinum. Yet the lopsided grin that tugged at the albino's lips shown that she'd regained a bit of her sanity.<br>
<br>
More than a bit.  With a laugh she moved over to the huntress and took her into a deep hug and kissed her swiftly.  Drawing back, not giving the Amazon a moment to ask a question she moved over to one corner and drew out the set of throwing daggers.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm going back to Athens in a week.  I need to ask a favor of you my love.&quot; Walking back with a piece of parchment in her palm. &quot;There is an old woman who lives north of the city, she is a healer, and a friend.  I've written down directions on how to find her.  She has a way with city guards and knows how to loosen tongues without causing a scene.&quot;<br>
<br>
Moving in a mad rush through the old inn she gathered supplies that had not been there before.  Breathing a silent thanks to Artemis the albino turned back to Lilith.<br>
<br>
&quot;I need to gather strength. And I think by tomorrow your wounds will be healed.&quot; That grin returned and the assassin turned to the dirty window next to the door.  With a predatory growl she gripped the set of daggers in her palm.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, and, good morning,&quot; she added softly and turned to look past her shoulder.  Realizing what she'd just done, she couldn't help but laugh faintly and offer a sheepish grin in apology for her tirade. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/urighteousrevenge.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RighteousRevenge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#993300>(9/20/02 12:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=373.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fortunecity.com/rivendell/chronos/478/untit.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: At the Inn...</span><hr size=1> The vixen cleared her throat and blinked a time or two, all the while watching the amazon go about her business with an intense interest.  Icy blue eyes flickered about after the treasured amazon and a slightly amused smile flickered then faded.  That same smile struggled to appear once more, but the huntress momentarily locked down on it by crossing tanned and solid arms.  <br>
<br>
&quot;You know you can ask anything of me and if it is within my power, I will help in any way...&quot;  She managed to get in the reply as the amazon darted about gathering the much needed and appreciated supplies.  Unearthly ice eyes flickered back and forth, following the amazon in her work.<br>
<br>
After long, almost reflective moments of silence spent simply observing the amazon, the huntress broke into a small smile.  &quot;Good morning...&quot;  With little thought or effort she withdrew her boiling mug from the flames, holding the near red metal in one unconcerned hand as ice eyes flickered from the amazon to the window and back again.<br>

A slender brow disappeared into wild bangs as she sat down quickly on an old chair that hardly stood against the rough motion.<br>

She sat down the still intensely hot mug on the ground without another thought and rather abruptly her arms crossed, hands disappearing from sight.<br>
<br>
How quickly she had become accustomed to the strange abilities that had all too recently been fused into her being.  The mixed blessing and curse was more than an affliction to her constantly waring senses.  She was lost in a distant haze of thoughts briefly, dark brows pulled up into an almost confused expression.<br>
<br>
With an slow exhale of breath, the Huntress focused on the beloved amazon once more.  &quot;Of course, I can ride out whenever you want me to...&quot; She cleared her throat once before icy eyes strayed to the half full mug once more.<br>

A silent conversation past between the two as their eyes locked.  Relenting the assassin closed her eyes and offered a nod. &quot;Very well, give me a moment.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kissing the hunter's cheek as she made her way over to the packs, Dosa knelt down in search of supplies.  Parchment and quill were removed and the albino set out to writing quickly scrawled text. What ever she wrote it made her point with few words.<br>
<br>
&quot;I need you to go to the harbor at Piraeus and take the first ship you can find to the island of Aegina.  In Aegina you will need to find the port tavern called the Laughing Dolphin.  There ask for Minos the tavern keeper.  If Minos is gone ask to speak with his eldest daughter, the person will tell you that Minos has no daughter, but you may speak with his son. When you speak with his son, give him this.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lifting a shaking palm the albino offers the hunter one of the notes she'd written. &quot;You will be given a wrapped package.  In it you will find a broken arrow and a child's wooden sword. When you have this book passage on a ship to Epidaurus. When you reach land head west to Tirynthus, then on to Lerna use the main roads you will find the city guards won't follow past Aegina.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;From Lerna head south west to Tegea, in Tegea ask after the Sleeping Lion at any shop, tavern or inn.  Find the location of the Sleeping Lion and ask to speak to the old teacher there.  When you find her, give her the sword and arrow along with this missive.&quot; With that said Dosa handed the hunter the other piece of parchment.<br>

Not waiting for the huntress to protest the albino took Lilith's free hand. &quot;I won't do anything until you get back.  I know it is going to be a long journey but what we are going to do can wait.  Time is on our side right now, the longer we wait, the more we have surprise on our side. I am going to head north to Eleusis and regain my strength there, I have a friend there who I trust.&quot;<br>
<br>
Squeezing Lilith's hand the albino's pale eyes seemed to fight to keep grip on what small sanity the assassin found in this quest. &quot;I wouldn't trust anyone else with this task.  I can't explain what will happen, I can't promise you won't be in danger. The one thing I do know is when you leave Tegea you will not be returning to me alone.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You should leave tomorrow morning, and before you leave I must give you something that will help you along your way.&quot; Slender brows quirked as a faint grin tugged at the corner of her mouth. She remained silent now to allow the huntress to absorb the information, yet she could not keep the pleading hidden in her eyes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/urighteousrevenge.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RighteousRevenge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#993300>(10/20/02 10:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=373.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fortunecity.com/rivendell/chronos/478/untit.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: At the Inn...</span><hr size=1> The often stoic huntress exhaled her breath ever so carefully.  She gave a gentle squeeze to the adored amazon's hand before sinking back a few feet to sit in a wobbly old chair.  She sat in silence for a long moment before drawing in a deep breath.   &quot;Someone once told me that life is nothing but a long series of journeys...I think perhaps I am beginning to believe her...&quot;  <br>
<br>
After a long contemplative moment, a slow grin broke across the stoic huntress' face.   Those precious scrolls were carefully tucked away into a well  guarded pouch on her belt.  Without any hesitation she caught hold of the amazon's hands and pulled her a few steps closer as she stood.  One gentle fingertip traced the graceful curve of the other woman's cheek before that same finger gently lifted the amazon's chin.  Unwavering, unshakable ice eyes fixed for brief seconds before another irreplaceable smile appeared.  &quot;As I told you before, anything you need will be done...I promise...&quot;<br>
<br>
There was something hard in her words, definite and certain.  The vixen's promises were set in the stone of her heart, words never to be forgotten.  Another moment shuffled away quietly before that tri-ringed brow raised to study the grin on her amazon's face, &quot;Give me something?...What?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=thermodosa>Thermodosa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#993300>(10/20/02 10:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=373.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/ithermodosa/017.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: At the Inn...</span><hr size=1> Pushing back the hair from the nape of her neck she turned herself around to show the huntress a scar, almost like a brand, on the back of her neck.  The design was a stylized tribal marking.  An arrow standing upright along the albino's spine, touching that an old style sword it's tip just passing the shaft of the arrow.  Behind that lay a cresent moon acting as if a bow string ready to fling the sword.<br>
<br>
&quot;This mark has been mine since the battle of Troy,&quot; turning back around she lowered her hair. The 13 of us each cut the design with a hot dagger into the flesh of our sisters.  Each in turn, I was the last, for I was the youngest.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pale silver eyes narrowed as the woman's fail grip on sanity seemed to slip away for a brief moment.  A stubborn jaw worked in thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;You will need this mark to gather enterance to finding the Sleeping Lion.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As you know, I have a gift with forging.  I can raise scar tissue in the shape of the design on our outer wrist, you can wear a bracer to cover the marking.  And when you're done I can remove the mark.&quot;<br>
<br>
With a sigh she lowered her eyes, &quot;I wish I could go myself, and save you the pain.  I cannot, much needs to be done here, and I would be too easily seen.&quot; The albino brused the back of her hand down her form as if to show of the fact that she could never cover up the pale flesh.<br>
<br>
&quot;I love you my beloved, yet I can not spare you this pain.&quot; The assassin appeared as if for a moment she would lose composure and shead a tear.  Yet all of her tears had been left behind in a prison cell in Athens. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/urighteousrevenge.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RighteousRevenge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#993300>(10/20/02 10:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=373.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fortunecity.com/rivendell/chronos/478/untit.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: At the Inn...</span><hr size=1> Lilith watched in silence, hazy ice eyes following every subtle movement of the amazon before her.  It seemed for a time that she struggled for words, but the struggle soon faded.  Fire boiled through half-mortal veins, burning behind ice eyes with the passion of insanity.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Pain?...&quot;  She spoke softly, only a hint of a grin flickering in and out of her voice, but never appearing on an ever stoic visage.  She leaned in softly to kiss the amazon's cheek before stepping away to stare distantly into the still blazing fire.  She hesitantly crouched down before the flames and rolled her fingertips through the blazing amber.  One palm brushed along the flaming embers carelessly.  &quot;You mean pain like this?&quot;<br>
<br>
After a moment that lasted a short eternity, the vixen withdrew that one scarred palm from the flames and rested it on her thigh.  &quot;I don't care about pain anymore, or fear, or fighting, or even home...&quot;  Cat-like pupils constricted as ice eyes fixed on the amazon.  &quot;I care about you, nothing more...whatever it takes, I will do it...&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=thermodosa>Thermodosa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#993300>(10/20/02 10:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=373.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/ithermodosa/017.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: At the Inn...</span><hr size=1> The albino registered surprise, that quickly faded into a faint grin. &quot;Very well then, I won't worry, as I trust you won't worry about me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shivering the assassin moved to the flames and crouched beside them. &quot;The morning then, just before dawn I will give you the last thing you need, as well as a map as to where I will be when you return.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I almost envy you, where you're going...&quot; she trailed off and leaned her cheek against Lilith's shoulder.<br>
<br>
The silence grew deeper to match the albino's breathing, and without warning she curled up at Lilith's feet.  Knees tugged as close to her chest as possible, her arms locked tight to hold them there.  Morpheus had taken hold of his cousin, wraping her in a deep needed shrowd of dreamless sleep.<br>
<br>
This action, more than any, shown how much the assassin trusted, and loved the huntress. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/urighteousrevenge.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RighteousRevenge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#993300>(10/20/02 10:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=373.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fortunecity.com/rivendell/chronos/478/untit.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: At the Inn...</span><hr size=1> &quot;I will always worry about you...&quot;  She whispered softly, words spoken more to herself than to any creature who might hear.  One could almost mistake the firelight shinning in her eyes as a faint teardrop.  It was only the smoke, the huntress swore and wiped the mist away.<br>
<br>
She settled to sit easily beside the amazon and stared distantly into the fading fire for long, long moments.  At last, the soft cry of some night bird brought her attention back to the present.  With a shake of her head she dismissed memories and wishes and found her way to her feet.<br>
<br>
From the scant remains of her saddlebags she withdrew the old blanket that always accompanied her bedroll.  With the quiet and ease of practice hunter she made her way silently across the old floorboards and settled down beside the amazon she so adored.  <br>
<br>
The blanket was ever so carefully spread across the amazon's form, tucked in gently until the huntress was satisfied.  Ice eyes flickered to every corner of the room, hovering briefly in the darkest shadows to dismiss all the phantoms of her mind.  At last she settled down beside the amazon and wrapped her darker form around the woman she loved, not trapping her, but protecting her, relishing in her nearness and warmth until sleep claimed her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thermodosa@amazonsunite>Thermodosa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#993300>(10/24/02 12:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=373.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/ithermodosa/017.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Dawn</span><hr size=1> The tendrils of dawn snaked across the morning sky, painting the Grecian countryside a veritable palette of silvery blues, deep purples and hot pinks. The sun's rays had just touched the roof of an old inn south of Athens waking the shadows and pushing them back against aged wood and crumbling fieldstone.<br>
<br>
Tucked into the protective foothills of Mt. Hymetlus the inn was far from the main roads and no market traffic reached it's doors. Small animals and birds were the usual inhabitants of the forgotten structure. As of late five newcomers had taken up residency.  A pair of two leggers and three large four leggers.<br>
<br>
A thin wisp of smoke rose from the chimney and a clump of wild doves had huddled close to the warm stones. Grateful for the new addition of heat to their usual spot to block the wind.<br>
<br>
Around the inn two mares and a pack horse milled around in search of grass under the thick leaves that blanketed the forest floor.<br>
<br>
A shadowy figure crouched on a fallen tree trunk, appearing like a large bird of prey with her cloak flowing out behind her extending her silhouette like feathery wings and tail.<br>
<br>
The assassin known as Thermodosa had watched the stars fade in the coming light for hours.  A fitful sleep had drawn nightmares in the early hours and disturbed the Amazon who chose to pass the sleepless hours in silence instead of waking the huntress inside the inn's common room.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope we're doing the right thing,&quot; Dosa whispered to the morning, then canted her head to the right as if waiting for the answer.  When none came she braced her arms on her knees and lowered her chin, starring out into the depthless trees as if seeing the path that lay before her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=righteousrevenge>RighteousRevenge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#993300>(10/24/02 12:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=373.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fortunecity.com/rivendell/chronos/478/untit.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Dawn</span><hr size=1> The faintest glimmer of light slipped through the ragged shutters and swept across the huntress' face.  With an exhaled yawn of irritation one ice eye flickered open to greet the offending beam of sun and quickly closed once more.  The vixen took great pains in rolling over to her back before she sat up, blinking as over sensitive  eyes adjusted to the beginnings of a new day.<br>
<br>
Sitting there she took the few moments to stir a small fire to life from the ashes and embers of the previous night.  Before she thought of any other matter, water was set to boil for her tea.  Finally thoughts registered and she blinked about the room, looking for the treasured amazon.<br>
<br>
She could not find the amazon and quickly caught hold of the scalding hot mug of tea and took a sip as she headed for the door.  The old rickety door squeaked on its hinges and offended both the huntress' sensitive hearing and her predatory instincts.  She grunted her distaste softly at the door before stepping away, unearthly ice eyes squinted against the sun that slowly peaked over the horizon.<br>

Pushing the cloak away from her face the albino placed a palm on Lilith's shoulder. &quot;I packed your saddle bags with the supplies we have, you shouldn't have to stop anywhere.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pale silver eyes lowered their lids half closed against the dawn's light as the albino reached around the hunter for her wrist.  Without much warning she gripped tightly, eyes snapped shut the smell of burnt hair raising in the air.  None saw the silver glow that covered their joined flesh or saw the draw of concentration on the albino's features.  It didn't take too long to perform what she had to do.<br>
<br>
When she drew her hand away a perfect mark of a moon, dagger and arrow was left behind. &quot;We should eat and leave soon.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vissibly shaking the albino quickly moved away from Lilith before she lost control over the fine spiderweb that held her emotions together, and her sanity. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=righteousrevenge>RighteousRevenge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#993300>(10/28/02 11:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=373.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fortunecity.com/rivendell/chronos/478/untit.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Breakfast?</span><hr size=1> The vixen gave no real visible reaction to her newly scarred flesh aside from a hard swallow to clear her throat.

After the morning haze cleared from her mind she stepped quietly after the amazon, half grinning.  &quot;I have no intentions of stopping...I sooner I get there, the sooner I return to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
The huntress hesitated a step, a freshly scarred arm reaching for the woman before her.  She stopped when her gaze fell across the design imprinted in her flesh.  She withdrew her arm and traced a fingertip across the raised flesh before she ignored the mark again.  Once more hands reached gently for the amazon's shoulders, a step forward and palms came into gentle contact with the other woman, yet made no attempt to hold her or draw her back.  &quot;I will miss you...&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thermodosa@amazonsunite>Thermodosa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#993300>(10/29/02 12:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=373.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/ithermodosa/017.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Breakfast?</span><hr size=1> &quot;....and I you.&quot; Stepping forward a gloved palm reached up and took a handfull of hair at the back of the huntress' head.

<br>
The kiss did not soften as she shown the love in her heart in one simple, harsh embrase.<br>
<br>
Without warning she drew back gasping for air, her eyes wild.  A shaking palm lifted to brush a lock of hair from the catlike icy eyes. &quot;I love you.&quot;<br>

Stepping back quickly she grasped a pack on the steps, &quot;in Athens.   It ends in Athens!
