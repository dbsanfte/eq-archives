Weapons: Moringal, Sword of Hell. Forged from the finest metals, from the deepest pits of Hell. Unbreakable, and seems to be alive. More powerful in Genesis's hands, as it was made for her

Other then that..she is the weapon..
</span></div> 		<div id="personalbio"><span class="title">Personal Bio ::</span> <span class="value">Genesis was born to an Olympion Goddess, and a White Howler werewolf. Abandoned at birth by her mother, she was brought up by The Amazons, her brother and sister (Jarith & Majectica) and a select few Olympion Gods.

At the age of Ten, Genesis met an untimely death. Hell, got thier hands on her. They added to her, demonic traits and dnas, a numberless amount. All this, to forge her into what was seen as the "Perfect Weapon". She was just that, in a short time, she had been responcible for destruction un-imaginable. She wiped out hundreds of species, took over countless realms and destroyed many civilizations. During this, she had become an Amazon Queen. To Hell, and many she is Perfect. Any with her on thier side, is sure to win. 
With her past now behind her, she strives to live a normal life. Her relationship with Hell has grown, and she now helps by choice..and inacticly helps run hell.

Her time is spent now, using what was forced onto her for more light aligned things. All that is in her, still not fully known to herself. Much records as to what was done, was lost, and many things forgotten, even by herself.</span></div>	</div> 	<div id="contactinfo">		<h2>My Contact Information</h2>		<div id="email"><span class="title">Email Address ::</span>  <span class="privatevalue">private</span></div>		<div id="pm">		<span class="title">My Inbox ::</span> 						<span class="value"><a href="" title="Send a message using the ezboard inbox feature" >Send me a Message!</a></span>				</div>		<div id="im"><span class="title">IM ::</span> <span class="value">AOL - VioletDaisy</span></div>		<div id="link"><span class="title">Personal Link ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="www.monkeegirl.com/rpg" target="_blank">Genesis Extended Profile</a></span></div>		<div id="recentposts"><span class="title">Recent Posts ::</span> 										<span class="value">		<dl>				<dt><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessage?topicID=296.topic&index=4" title="post" target="_blank">Re: Making an Example (All Athelfi are Welcomed to Join)</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Amazons of the Northern Lands</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessage?topicID=288.topic&index=18" title="post" target="_blank">Re: Honouring the new Queen</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Amazons of the Northern Lands</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm35.showMessage?topicID=7.topic&index=22" title="post" target="_blank">oath</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm35" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Amazon Nation Alliance</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessage?topicID=288.topic&index=7" title="post" target="_blank">Re: Honouring the new Queen</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Amazons of the Northern Lands</a></em></dd>				</dl>				</span>				</div>	</div>	<div class="spacer"></div> </div>  <!-- profile footer --> <div id="footing">© Copyright 1999-2003 <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/">ezboard, Inc.</a> All rights reserved.</div></div></body></html><!-- CSS:XHTML 2002 JR.o -->
