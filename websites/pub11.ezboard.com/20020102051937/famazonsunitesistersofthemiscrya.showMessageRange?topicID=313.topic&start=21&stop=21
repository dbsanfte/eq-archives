I'm here, I am.... I'm not leaving you... don't do that.~  She placed a calming kiss to Zelia's forehead. <br>
<br>
 II Zelia II:  This sucks,Varia. It really does. Sure I deserve it,but it's just as bad as being cooped up in that cave! ::She stops pulling on the bar. Tries to calm her breathing:: I know I shouldn't be anxious but when is my trial going to start? <br>
<br>
 CristalC15:  I don't know... probably soon, as soon as Vasilissa Hippolyte is able to hold one. Calm down, okay? Everything is going to work out exactly how it's supposed to. You trust me, right? ~she smiles a little bit~ <br>
<br>
 II Zelia II:  Yes I trust you...and I trust,everything will work out exactly how it's suppose to. Like me getting executed,thats how it's going to be,isn't it? <br>
<br>
 CristalC15:  ~her heart skipped a beat and she flinched hearing those words~ No, I don't think so. You were already exectued, remember? This is just the trial to determine atonement. Oh I wish I could go in there and hold you... ~she teared up a bit and tried not to cry, for Zelia's sake, and since crying wouldn't help anything anyway.~ <br>
<br>
 II Zelia II:  ::Sighs and leans her forehead on the bars:: Yeah,I was executed already. ::Looks back to her.:: Maybe thats the way its suppose to be. I mean,that one time wasn't the first time. <br>
::She was just afraid and nervous about having to go up against those who wanted to convict her:: Maybe I should just end it all myself,save the trouble for anyone else. <br>
<br>
 CristalC15:  Don't you dare, ~Varia said in a low, even tone.~ I can't believe you would even consider that. You're much braver than that Zelia, and it's time for you to stand up and face the music, no matter how afraid you are. And you're not alone, I hope you know that. ~she took Zel's hand and placed it over her heart~ Do you remember what I told you last night? <br>
<br>
 II Zelia II:  ::She closes her eyes, a single tear runs down her cheek as she feels Varias heart:: Yes I remember. ::She opens her eyes and looks at her:: I'm sorry. Don't be mad at me. <br>
<br>
 CristalC15:  I'm not mad at you Zelia. ~she reached out and gently wiped Zel's tear away~ Just don't ever forget what I said... it's the truth. ~she held Zel's hand tighter against her chest~ <br>
<br>
 II Zelia II:  ::Sighs a bit releived Var wasnt mad at her.:: Okay,I can handle it....how hard could it be? he-he. ::Furrows her brows:: <br>
<br>
 CristalC15:  ~Varia smiled~ That's my Zel. Good girl. ~she laughed and pressed her forehead up against Zelia's~ <br>
<br>
 II Zelia II:  Did I mention,I'm glad youre here? ::Smiles lightly:: <br>
<br>
 CristalC15:  Yeah, you did. ~she smiled more brightly and kissed Zel's nose.~ I soooo love you.... <br>
<br>
 II Zelia II:  ::Her smiles widens some:: Say....i'm not keeping you here am I? ::Now grins,but quickly wripes it away:: I know you can't be comfortable here?  <br>
<br>
 CristalC15:  More comfortable than you are, hun. ~Var playfully nipped at Zel's nose and smiled.~ Naw, I have nowhere else to be right now... you're not keeping me. And besides, I don't think you're exactly in a position to keep me here! ~she laughed lightly~ <br>
<br>
 II Zelia II:  ::She smirks and nods:: Yes well,don't under estimate me,babe. ::She took on a dangerously playful look. Like she would just tear the bars away and pounce Varia:: <br>
<br>
 CristalC15:  Oooh... ~Var laughed~ Gonna get tough now, are you? ~she stopped laughing and looked serious at Zel.~ You stay put, Zel. You know you have to stay put. I don't want anything bad to happen. <br>
<br>
 II Zelia II:  ::Looks disappointed:: I know,your right. ::Sighs deeply:: This so sucks. I'm not going to hurt anyone,why can't they just let me out. <br>
<br>
 CristalC15:  Because it's Amazon law. You'll be out of there soon, don't worry. Besides, this way I can keep an eye on ya! ~she laughed~ They don't trust you right now... give them time, Zelia. <br>
<br>
 II Zelia II:  ::She glances to the gaurds,then looks back to Varia:: Maybe...::whispers:: I can just squeeze out of these bars.....::smiles::  I'm Joking of course. ::Sure she was smiling and trying to make jokes,but inside she was going crazy. Jail sucks.:: <br>
<br>
 CristalC15:  Zelia... don't joke about escaping, they might think you're serious. ~Varia reached her arm around back of Zelia and pulled her into a hug, even against the bars it was still a hug.~ Just hang tight, everything is going to work out, love. <br>
 <br>
 II Zelia II:  ::Manages to hug Varia back,through the bars. Grumbling now because those bars were beginning to be a burden. But keeps telling herself it will all be over shorty....she hopes anyways.:: I know I know....Hey! I just realized,I didn't see you when I was outside earlier....were you hiding? <br>
<br>
 CristalC15:  No, I wasn't exactly hiding, I was just... watching. I didn't know what to do... but when I saw the guards take you to jail I couldn't stand it anymore, so I followed them in here to you. <br>
<br>
 II Zelia II:  Oh,ok. That works for me. ::Smiles some::  <br>
<br>
 CristalC15:  I hope so! ~she laughed and nuzzled up against Zel~ Hey have I told you I love you yet today? <br>
 <br>
 II Zelia II:  ::Laughs softly:: Yes,dear. You have...and I love you too. More than you know. <br>
<br>
 CristalC15:  ~Varia's lips curved up into a wide smile~ I think I might have a clue, ~she said. Then she turned serious once again.~ If you get an advocate, I'd like to be it, if it's allowed, of course.... ~she let her voice trail off and looked a bit nervously at Zel~ <br>
<br>
 II Zelia II:  ::She quirks a brow:: Sure,thats fine with me. I just don't want you to get any hassle from anyone. I wouldn't like that one bit. <br>
<br>
 CristalC15:  I wouldn't either, ~Var joked~ that's why I said if it's allowed... I'll have to ask Hippolyte and DeLerium if that is acceptable. ~her nervousness faded as Zelia said it was okay with her.~ I haven't been in this tribe that long, and I don't know if the laws here are the same as my old tribe... <br>
<br>
 II Zelia II:  ::Frowns thinking of DeLerium. She brings a hand up and lightly traces her fingers along the scar that was still evident on her neck:: Yeah. The laws. ::She glances down,letting her hand fall to her side:: <br>
 <br>
 CristalC15:  I think it will be all right, I mean an advocate is an advocate, right? It doesn't matter who it is, right? ~she tried to reassure Zelia. She reached a hand inside and traced the scar along Zel's neck, trailing her fingers along after Zel dropped her hand down to her side~ It's going to be okay, Zelia. I know it is. <br>
 <br>
 II Zelia II:  ::Flinches slightly as Varia touches her scar:: DeLerium is one angry amazons. If she knows anything about you and I,i'd bet she would do her best to keep you from speaking for me. The first chance she gets,I wouldn't doubt she'd try to lop my head off again. ::Huffs angrily:: <br>
<br>
 CristalC15:  Hey... don't. She does know, and she is the Princess of Themiscrya, Zelia. Soon to be a Queen. I think the best thing for you to do regarding DeLerium is nothing. Don't speak of her, to her, or go near her. She loves this tribe with all her heart, and she will not forgive you... that is a lost cause. Please, don't focus on that... focus on me, or home, or whatever you need to focus on to clear your mind and stay strong... please... ~she looked at Zelia with pleading eyes, not angry, just love and hope.~<br>
 <br>
 II Zelia II:  Youre right,it is a lost cause. ::Pulls herself away from the bars,and begins to pace around the small cell:: How can I clear my mind? It's always going....I've done terrible things...::Her breathing once again begins to pick. She stops herself from going on about her past:: Is this even worth it? Having a trial,is it worth it? I might as well face the facts,youre the only person who will ever except me and love me. Thats all I need,is you. I shouldnt have even come here. ::She stomps her foot on the ground::<br>
 <br>
 CristalC15:  ~Varia's eyes teared up again, and she spoke softly.~ Come here, please... ~a tear rolled down her cheek as she looked at her lover.~ <br>
<br>
 II Zelia II:  ::Moves back over to the bars,and looks at Varia.:: Don't cry,please. ::Reaches her hands through the bars again. She lightly carresses Varias cheek,while wriping the tear away:: I'm sorry. I can't help it,going off like that. It's this cell,its so small....I hate small places. <br>
<br>
 CristalC15:  I hate small places too... ~she leaned into Zel's hand and sighed~ It's worth it. It is. ~another tear~ I'm so proud of you for coming back here, Zelia. It took a lot of strength, you know that? <br>
<br>
 II Zelia II:  ::Nods slightly:: I'd be lost without you. ::She sayed quietly:: <br>
<br>
 CristalC15:  Good thing you have me, then.~ she whispered just as quietly, kissing Zel's knuckles.~ And you always will. <br>
<br>
 II Zelia II:  ::Sighs contently,making herself comfortable against the cold bars::  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessageRange?topicID=313.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessageRange?topicID=313.topic&start=41&stop=42>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessage?topicID=317.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessage?topicID=307.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.emailToFriend?topicID=313.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.threadControl?topicID=313.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=313.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=313.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm37">The Mythical Odyssey Forum<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitefrm32">The Mythical Odyssey<option value="amazonsunitefrm35">Amazon Nation Alliance<option value="amazonsunitefrm33">Character Descriptions<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm30">Amazons of the Sacred Circle<option value="amazonsunitefrm34">Amazons of Lesvos Island<option value="amazonsunitefrm38">High Mountain Tiger Clan<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm28">Amazon Sisters of Cremni<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm31">Amazon Language<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya>Sisters of Themiscrya</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
