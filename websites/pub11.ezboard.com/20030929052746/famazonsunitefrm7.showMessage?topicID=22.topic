but of what so happened long, long ago..<br>
<br>
It was a bright full moon night, the humid air of the end of summer clung had my cloths clinging to my skin, though my cloths were scarce. What was a child of the forest ready to have to wear except the skins of a few of her kills, knitted messily together covering her vital areas.<br>
<br>
She came upon a structure, a large wooden one, with bright lights burning inside, and the voices of women, happily enjoying the company of each other. Picking on a few of the males who ventured into the wrong territory that night.<br>
<br>
The young girl watched with amazement through an open window, watching carefully the one who seemed to be incharge, the lovely auburn haired women, who didnt tower in hight, but you know she towered in strength and power.<br>
<br>
The young girl made a decision, one that had changed her life for the better. She climbed through the window. For, she didnt know what a door was, she never saw one before. Once inside, she had a better veiw of the women. They wore cloths, somewhat similar to the males she had killed previously, but they showed more skin. The young girl felt very awkward for a moment, there they were looking all tidy and clean, and there she was, her brown hair tosseled with dirt and leaves, a few sticks stuck within the nestlike hair. Dirt and dried blood in patches on her skin from that nights hunt and kill. Time seemed to stop as one by one, they looked to the wild girl. She wanted to leave, to run out quickly, but it was as if she were frozen. Then suddenly, the first one she had noticed, had walked over to her. She told her her name was Hippolyte, and she was the Queen of the Amazons in Themiscrya. <br>
The young girl had no clue as to what she was talking about, and that showed on her face, Hippolyte, then explained to her what an amazon was, and what they stood for. The young girl liked it. But when the Queen asked her her name, she didnt know what to say, for she never had a name, she hardly knew of her mother, she knew he rmother was killed infront of her eyes as she hid, she knew that she in the end, waited until she was older and tore up the ones who killed her mother with her bare hands, and a few of her wolves. She had dinned on a feast that night of her revenge. She had heard a word once, someone calling her delusional...but she couldnt find that word at that moment. The only word that came from her dry lips was the word DeLerium....<br>
From that day, Hippolyte took her under her wing and taught her the way of the Amazons, she taught her fighting, skill, techniques. She was a quick learner of the weapons, especially the Labrys and staff. Hippolyte taught her the education only a Queen could teach a person who knew...sadly...nothing...She even taught her how to use utensils to eat food. DeL was intriged by it all, and soon became like the daughter Hippolyte hadnt had at that time.<br>
In the few short years of Themsicrya, DeL has been issued ranks, awards, and titles, but nothing like the title she holds now, the one most sacred to her, the one she worked hardest for...Princess...<br>
Until her dying day, Themiscrya and the amazons and wolves within, will be her family.<br>
<br>
This is my most fondest Themsicrian memory..<br>
<br>
