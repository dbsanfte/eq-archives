I am no threat. There's no need to go on a hunt, I mearly come to pass the time and see how the amazons are faring, and apparently it is rather pourly. If the bastards of DoG haven't bothered yet, then I can make sure they never do.<br>

 And with that Solari disappeared into the shadows, knowing she was being watched. She, herself, retreated to the darkness and to the trees. If this was someone from the old SCS tribe, Solari knew her best chance for surprise was in the trees.
