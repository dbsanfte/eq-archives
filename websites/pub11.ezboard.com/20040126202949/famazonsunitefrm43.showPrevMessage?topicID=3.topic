waddled through the Amazon village.  Amazon leathers hugged her valuptuious body.  The dark brown top covered her husky torso ending at her waist.   The sleeves of the top opened up at the bottom, underneith her underarm.  The top was accompanied by a matching bottom, that would've been quite short on a taller Amazon, but ended at the short Amazon's knees.  The poor tigress's belly looked as if she was about the explode, for she was pregnant.  Being the Amazon Goddess of Maternity; she was pretty much cursed with such a burden.<br>
<br>
She waddled her way down the village, looking for an Amazon to talk to and end her social needs, she was a talkative little one.  Teygra hoped to find her neice, Queen Ardyn, which she really needed to talk to.<br>
<br>
As the Amazon Goddess trudged along, her sandles squeaked with her every step as she slightly swayed side to side.  Her long white tendrils accompanied by black tiger-like locks swayed with her movements.  Her pale skin, decorated with black tiger markings, glowed in the bright sunlight.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where is my neice?&quot;  she softly mumbled to herself.  She often spoke to herself when there was no one around to hear her words. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udaughterofshylock.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daughter of Shylock</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 131<br> <font color=#993300>(9/24/02 4:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Princess Camryn</span><hr size=1> The little princess crawled through the open lands of her Mother's ruling. She wore her Shamaness leathers, which she hated. Her short bright red hair was held up in pigtails. <br>
<br>
She looked up at the tiger-like woman and smiled brightly. Within her childish smiled were two canine teeth that stuck out the side of her mouth sharply. <br>
<br>
She gave a cute little wave to the woman with her tiny tiger striped hand. And here she thought that the only two &quot;Tiger People&quot; in the world, were her and her Mother Ardyn. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamazonqueenardyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amazon Queen Ardyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#993300>(9/24/02 4:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/queenardyn/images/ardyn222.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Auntie Teygra! yay!</span><hr size=1> Ardyn strolled out of her hut, clad in her shaman leathers. She pushed two rogue strands of faded red hair behind her ear, while the rest of the tresses were pulled back into a ponytail.<br>
<br>
Her skin was wrapped in tiger stripes and razor sharp canines peeked from pink lips. Green pools scanned the village, they stopped on a crawling Ardyn and Teygra?!?!!<br>
<br>
A wide grin claimed her lips as she ran to her Auntie. She pulled her Aunt into a light hug as not to hurt the baby. Speaking of babies, Ardyn picked up her own and cradled it before setting the child on her hip.<br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;Well, hello there!&quot; she said, bending down as far as she could without smushing the baby inside her.  <br>
<br>
Just then, pretty much out of no where, she was taken into the arms of her neice, Ardyn.  Happy to be hugged by her, whom she hadn't seen in a while, she imidiately hugged back as tight as she could without hurting the baby.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, Yasoo!!  How are you?  I've missed my niece so much!&quot;<br>
<br>
Out of all the happiness and joy, it was ruined to her by a sharp pain in her womb area.  She grabed her stomach, making an aching growling noise.  Teygra tried to keep it low so the baby Camryn wouldn't be frighten.  The Amazon Goddess knew that this wasn't another kick given off from the baby, she knew that the baby had gone into the lightning stage.  This pain could go on for hours or even days...she was about to find out.<br>
<br>
&quot;My niece, Queen Ardyn, I believe the baby's birth will be soon.  My water hasn't broken yet, but the baby's dropped a bit into the birth canal.  And it is not the best feeling I've ever felt.&quot; her words were heavy with her breath, for this was her first birthing...and she was scared.<br>
<br>
At the moment the Amazon Goddess really wished that she had not been cursed with having to do this yearly at the most.  But she knew that after the birthing was over, she would be proud of her title and would hold it strong.  But that was in the future...and this is NOW.<br>
<br>
((FYI--The Lightning Stage is when the baby just barely drops into the birth canal..the water doesn't have to brake yet, for this could last for days before the birthing begins.)) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uteygraothewind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Teygra O the Wind</A> at: 9/24/02 5:12:15 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamazonqueenardyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amazon Queen Ardyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#993300>(9/24/02 5:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/queenardyn/images/ardyn222.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Oh crap...</span><hr size=1> Ardyn nearly jumped clear out of her skin at the sound of her Aunt in pain.<br>

&quot;Good Ancestors all mighty!&quot;<br>
<br>
The Amazon Goddess was REALLY REALLY bad at delivering babies. She had fainted when her Mom gave birth and tore some kids baby doll to shreads when she had given birth to Cammy.<br>
The Queen shifted Camryn to her other hip and helped her Aunt to a bench that sat in the Village Centre about 50 yards from the daily lit bon fire.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please dont give birth now!&quot;,Ardyn pleaded with her Aunt.<br>
