She'd spent days writing and planning the ceremony, and now it was time...<br>
<br>
&quot;We gather here this day to bind together these women in a ritual of love. Let all who stand within this village be here of their own free will and accord in peace and love. We charge this village to be filled with love. May this sacred space be consecrated before the Ancients and Gods alike, and may it be a Guardian and Protection for the work we do this day. <br>
<br>
Let Vasilissa Yakut and Christanna stand here before us and in the Presence of the Ancient Ones. <br>
<br>
To the East: Be with us here oh Spirits of the Air. With your breath of life, join the bonds between these two and tie them tightly.<br>
<br>
To the South: Be with us here oh Beings of Fire. Give their love and passion your own all consuming ardor.<br>
<br>
To the West: Be with us here of Beings of Water. Grant these two the deepest of love richness of body, soul and spirit.<br>
<br>
To the North: Be with us here, oh Spirits of Earth, Let your strength and constancy be theirs for as long as they desire to be together.<br>
<br>
Blessed Ancients, look with joy on this Union of these women. Grant them harmony and beauty in their lives and let them be always mindful of their commitment, one to the other.  <br>
<br>
Let them so live together that their joy of each other will be a shining beacon for all to see. <br>
<br>
Give to these two your love and protection. <br>
<br>
Above you the Stars, Below you the stones. <br>
<br>
As time passes remember this; Like a stone your love should be firm, Be close, yet not so close that you restrict one another. Possess one another yet grant each other freedom to grow. Be understanding and compassionate. Have patience with each other, For storms may come, but they will quickly go.<br>
<br>
Be free in giving warmth and affection, make love often and be sensuous to one another. Fear not least the ways or words of the unenlightened, for the Ancients are with you now and always. <br>
<br>
Each expose one hand. Your blood shall symbolize the many sacrifices you have made for this night.&quot;<br>
<br>
She took ahold of Yakut's hand as she spoke,<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you, Yakut, take this woman, Christanna, as your life partner? To honor her through trials, to help her, and to love her through all?&quot;<br>
<br>
With her answer, she took a dagger and lightly cut her palm, then took Christanna's hand as well.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you, Christanna, take this woman, Yakut, as your life partner? To honor her through trials, to help her, and to love her through all?&quot;<br>
<br>
She cut Tanna's palm and guided their hands together with a smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;May you be joined in heart, soul, body, and mind.<br>
<br>
Place the rings on each others' finger. As we bind together these women in love and marriage, may they be forever bind so in their future. May they hold fast to each other, even as they are now heldfast. As the Ancients are witness to the serites, I now proclaim you to be wed, one to the other. <br>
<br>
Dear Ancients, we thank you for your presence on this joyful day of matrimony. Bless these women to be forever joined together in love.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled, finally silencing. She was finished. The ceremony was completed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3F3F3F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamazonqueenyakut.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amazon Queen Yakut </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen</span><br>  Posts: 107<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(2/8/02 9:46 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/cristalc15/images/yakut.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Ceremony</span><hr size=1> Yakut kinda flinched as her palm was slit but smiled as its was placed in Tanna's. As Belle spoke she placed the snow leopard ring with an aquamarine stone as the snow leopards eye, upon Tanna's finger. Yakut brows quirked up at the statement of make love. Yakut was still a virgin. <br>
<br>
Yakut smiled and kissed her love on the lips as the blood from her hand ran down her hand. <p>§-:¦:-§ Yakut §-:¦:-§ <BR>

<br>
Xena smiled slightly in return,and looked at her friend thoughtfully,'always trying to be strong' she thought to herself,knowing Gabrielle was trying to hide something under a smile.<br>
<br>
She directs her attention to Belle,as Belle started and finished the ceromony. Her eyes then drifting to Yakut and Christanna,she then returns her gaze to Gabrielle,wondering what was on Gabrielles mind to make her feel she needed to hide behind a smile. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3F3F3F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=amazonprincessraven>Amazon Princess Raven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(2/9/02 2:18 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Atmah Cyane</span><hr size=1> (I was too lazy to switch names.)<br>

Cyane smiled as she appeared standing before both Yakut and Tanna. A golden mist was formed around her. She looked to Yakut.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sister, I am so glad to see you have found happiness in your life. We all deserve someone to love within our hearts.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked to Tanna.<br>
<br>
&quot;With this new loves, comes new responsibilities. You are now a wife and a mother of Yakut's children. Body, heart and soul you are joined.&quot;<br>
<br>
She cast her eyes to Belle and Alysia both.<br>
<br>
&quot;And remember Yakut, Tanna. . . .love is always needed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes she was hinting to the Scynthians there.<br>
<br>
&quot;Blessings to you both.&quot;<br>

She placed a beautiful snow leopard ring on Yakut's finger, then brought it to her lips and kissed it. ~For eternity, my love and loyalties lie with you,~ she whispered and kissed her. ~I promise to be everything you want or need.

<br>
As the Atmah had appeared Yakut bowed her head in respect. She smiled at the Atmah words. Yakut then looked up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you, Atmah.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yakut glanced to Belle and whoever else was there. She saw Glory throwing the flowers and Ardyn playing with a lizard. Xena and Gab chillin in the back. Faith sitting alone. Alysia/Samsara watching. She took in a deep breath and smiled at her wife.<br>
<br>
&quot;I love you with all my heart.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then turned to Belle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you Isabelle. This means the world to me and I wouldnt have anyone else be the shamaness but you. I owe you a great debt. For you have brought together my soul with Christanna's. Now, my family is complete. I have my sisters. I have my wife. and my lovely children.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yakut had no real blood sister but she considered Varia Avande, Alysia, Belle, Faith and Tyger her own.<br>
