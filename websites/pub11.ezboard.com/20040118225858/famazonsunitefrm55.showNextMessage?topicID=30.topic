She had just returned from another trip to Hyrcania, and this time she had brought back a surprise. <br>
<br>
A woman and child followed behind, sharing a horse of their own. The woman had long blond hair that hung in a braid over her shoulder, and fair skin. The child looked somewhat like her, and had the look of a sunny disposition. <br>
<br>
All rode in silence as they entered the village. Rhiannon, because she did not know what anyone would think. She didn't even know what she was thinking. Most likely no one would think anything of her bringing back a friend, but Rhia's mind was wrapped around the kiss they'd shared the first night out after leaving Hyrcania. <br>
<br>
She had hardly spoken to Lysippe since, though she was not by any means ignoring her. It had just grown slightly...uncomfortable for her. She was drawn alternately between wanting to kiss her and wanting to run away from her.<br>
<br>
She led the way to the stables, and dismounted. <br>

<br>
The Amazon had been watching as they'd entered the village, and liked what she saw.  Hyrcania showed the influences of many other cultures, which was interesting too, but Marpesia was purely Amazon in a way few tribes were these days.  <br>
<br>
She bent down a bit to get close to her daughter's eye level.  &quot;I know this is all exciting, but I need you to stay where Rhia or I can see you while we take care of the horses.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Okay, mama...&quot;  The little girl bounced off to find something to entertain herself with as Lysippe removed her horse's saddle and began to brush the animal down.  <br>
<br>
&quot;From what I've seen so far, this is one of the more traditional tribes,&quot; Lys said to the quiet redhead, hoping to at least get a conversation going.<br>

<br>
&quot;Very traditional. There are ceremonies and formalities for everything. It ties everyone together, so it's almost like a family.&quot; She paused. &quot;Marpesia's alot smaller than Hyrcania. I wouldn't be surprised if everyone in the village knew of my return...and your arrival, within the hour.&quot; Rhia chuckled. &quot;I know you'll love it though. And I hope you'll get the chance for that rest and relaxation I promised you. You certainly deserve it.&quot; She looked into Lysippe's eyes, and blushed. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://user.netomia.com/angelkim/rhia.png"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;">~*~Rhiannon~*~<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/bamazonnation">Shatomlic Healer</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm55">Co-Vasilissa of SoH</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->~*~Everything is okay in the end.

Rhiannon broke first. She was still smiling as she looked away though. &quot;First off I should take you and the lass to see Queen Chiara. Then we can get you settled into my yurt.&quot; She handed her reins off to an eager stablehand and headed back out the way she had come in.<br>
&quot;Sounds like a plan...&quot;  Lys gave a whistle, and Ilea soon trotted up to meet them.  The small party set off, and Lysippe took a moment to remind her daughter how to behave.  &quot;You know how I've told you to show respect to the queen and princess back home?  That's doubly important here.&quot;<br>
The little girl looks a bit worried.  &quot;Okay, mama.&quot;<br>
The warrior smiles back.  &quot;Just be your usual sweet self, and you'll do fine.&quot;<br>
Rhia grins at Ilea, thinking she was just as adorable as ever. The usual sadness that came to her when she was around children seemed be put on the backburner around this little girl. &quot;You'll be great, doll. Don't worry at all.&quot; She moved to walk next to Lysippe, with Ilea just a step or two ahead of them. Just being closer to her helped her relax. <br>
As they walk, Lysippe takes in the village.  A few moments later, she lets out a sardonic laugh.  &quot;I don't know why I didn't put it together before... the first Queen here was Marpesia, right?&quot; Rhiannon nods. &quot;Yes. The mountains were once called the Marpesian Mountains, but it has been reduced over time to just this village.&quot;<br>
&quot;They're still called the Marpesians in the outside world,&quot; Lysippe informs her. &quot;No Thessalonikan merchant dares to take this route.&quot;<br>
Rhiannon chuckles. &quot;I honestly don't know much of the area. Since becoming an amazon, I've not really gone outside the bounds of the Nation.&quot; They passed by many of the homes, and headed straight for a large stone building on the other end of the village square. Rhia paused at the bottome of the steps leading inside.<br>
Lys pauses alongside her.  &quot;And, Marpesia didn't just found this tribe.  She's one of the most famous queens in the Nation's history.  Up there with the first Hippolyte, and my namesake.&quot;<br>
The blonde has to grin.  &quot;You don't do anything by halves, do you?&quot;<br>
Rhiannon looked up into her eyes again and grinned. &quot;Never. It's all or nothing with me.&quot; She grew silent as her words sank into her own mind.<br>
After a beat, Lys speaks again. &quot;So, Queen Chiara is usually here this time of day?&quot;<br>
&quot;Almost always. Especially since I've been gone for a while, when I'm away she has to do the work for both of us.&quot; Rhia looks up to the doors. &quot;I'll go in and let her know I&quot;m back and that I've brought company. She may want to prepare.&quot;<br>
Lys nods.  &quot;Ilea and I can entertain ourselves for a couple minutes, can't we?&quot;  She grins, and hefts the little girl to her shoulder.<br>
Rhia smiles again and heads inside. She closes the door behind her and calls out. &quot;Chiara?&quot; <br>
A few moments later, the Queen appears.  &quot;Welcome back... how did everything go?&quot;<br>
Rhiannon grinned. It seemed as though she couldn't stop smiling since they passed through the gates. &quot;It went well. There were a couple of deaths, some resurrections and a birth or two. The usual drama you hear out of Hyrcania.&quot; She paused. &quot;Kalasin is back. She's apparently immortal this time. I fear she has abilities she can't control, not with the way her emotions run. You should know, in case she ever shows up here.&quot; Another pause. &quot;I brought a friend back with me. And her daughter. They are waiting outside to meet you right now.&quot; She glances towards the doors.<br>
?Very well...  is this the pair you've mentioned before?&quot;  Chiara thinks she remembers Rhia mentioning a friend with a child.<br>
&quot;Yes, Lysippe and her daughter Ilea. Wait until you meet Ilea. She is the sweetest little girl. Of course, she's had a great mother...&quot; Rhia trails off as she realizes she's starting to ramble. She coughs nervously. &quot;I'll..uh...just let them in then, if that's okay with you.&quot;<br>
Chiara gives Rhia a momentary raised eyebrow at the ramble, but then makes her face neutral again. &quot;Of course&quot;<br>
Rhiannon nearly rushes to the door, wanting to be out from under Chiara's gaze. Was it just her imagination, or had she seemed slightly...amused? Once she was back outside again, she motioned for Lysippe and Ilea to follow her. &quot;She's ready.&quot;<br>
&quot;Okay, cutie...&quot; the blonde says, rounding up her daughter. &quot;Time to meet the Queen.&quot;  She takes the little girl's hand, and starts upo the stairs.<br>
Rhiannon leads the way back in again, and clears her throat. &quot;Queen Chiara, this  is Lysippe and Ilea of the Shatomlic Amazons.&quot; She tried to be as formal as she supposed one would be, but she still wasn't completely sure of amazon tradition. <br>
Lysippe gave a respectful nod.  &quot;It's an honor to meet you, finally.  Rhia's talked about her sisters here a lot.&quot;<br>
The Queen sizes her up... an odd mixture of strength and softness, this one.  Not unlike Rhia. &quot;And, we've heard moe than a little of you.&quot;<br>
Rhiannon blushes. She waits quietly to the side while Chiara and Lysippe get to know each other.<br>
Lysippe fights off a blush as well.  &quot;There have been some adventures lately, and Rhia suggested we spend some time here.  I have to say it was a great idea on her part; it's beautiful here.&quot; <br>
Ilea pipes up, &quot;I like all da horses..&quot;<br>
Rhiannon ruffles the child's hair, and speaks to Lysippe. &quot;Marpesia's famous for it's horse breeding, even outside the Nation.&quot;<br>
&quot;...and its horsewomen,&quot; Chiara concludes.<br>
&quot;Among other things, but that is what the tribe is most known for.&quot;<br>
With that hidden smirk only someone who knows her as well as Rhia does would see, Chiara wraps up the interview.  &quot;Let me know if there's anything either of you need, but I think Rhia's going to be an attentive host.&quot;<br>
Rhiannon sees the smirk, but says nothing. &quot;I will return to my duties in the morning, Sister. I'm sure you'll be grateful to not have to read reports anymore.&quot;<br>
&quot;Who said I was the one who did, Rhiannon?&quot; Chiara said, with that same barely perceptible smirk. &quot;It's good to have you back.  And, welcome to Marpesia, Lysippe and little Ilea.&quot;  The queen turns, and disappears back into her own rooms.<br>
The Shatomlic Wise Woman wasn't quite sure what to make of Chiara's apparent sternness, but since it didn't appear to bother Rhia merely shrugged and set the issue aside.<br>
&quot;I'm sure you're as ready as I am to rest up. Why don't we head back to my hut?&quot;<br>
&quot;Sounds good to me...&quot;  Lys has raised Ilea long enough to know that once the initial excitement has worn off she's going to be dealing with a very sleepy little girl.<br>
Rhiannon leads the way back out again. It was a short walk, as her hut was nearby. She opened the door, glad there was not too much dust. She held the door open for them so they could pass. &quot;This is it. Home sweet home.&quot;<br>
&quot;Very nice... being a queen has its perks, huh?&quot;  Lys grins.<br>
&quot;Sure does. It's different though from my place in Hyrcania. I'm used to the smell of herbs around me. This is almost too...normal.&quot; She laughs.<br>
Lys glances around a moment.  &quot;I know you weren't expecting to bring back guests... anything I can do to help set up?&quot;<br>
Rhiannon thinks for a moment. &quot;I don't think so. It shouldn't take me but a minute to fix up sleeping places for you and Ilea.&quot; She looks to Ilea, knowing she would be getting sleepy pretty soon. &quot;There's enough room here that space won't be an issue either.&quot;<br>
&quot;Okay, just thought I'd check... Ilea, I'm not sure Rhia wants you to touch that...&quot; Lys says, as she heads over to handle her daughter.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://user.netomia.com/angelkim/rhia.png"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;">~*~Rhiannon~*~<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/bamazonnation">Shatomlic Healer</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm55">Co-Vasilissa of SoH</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->~*~Everything is okay in the end.

Lysippe started to unpack her things, and Ilea's.  &quot;I see why you found Queen Chiara hard to describe.  She's not exactly 'nice', but she's good.&quot; <br>

Rhiannon made small gestures to let Lysippe know where to put her things as they unpacked and talked.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.joshronda.com/kristen/rhiannon.bmp"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;">~*~Rhiannon~*~<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/bamazonnation">Shatomlic Healer</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm55">Co-Vasilissa of SoH</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->~*~Everything is okay in the end.
