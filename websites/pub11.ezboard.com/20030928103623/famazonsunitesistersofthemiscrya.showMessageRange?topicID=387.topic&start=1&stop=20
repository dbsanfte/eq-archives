 Cyrene had made the long trip from across the sea to Amazon lands.  She now stood across the path from the Labrys Amazon Tavern and stared down at a piece of parchment in her palm. &quot;Yes, I think this is it.&quot;<br>
Taking in a deep breath, the older woman tucked a few strands of thick curly hair behind one ear and made her way into the tavern.  Finding it empty, a brow rose, &quot;my my, this will be interesting.&quot;<br>
Moving along the bar, she ran her fingertip along it's worn surface, absently she rubbed her finger and thumb together as pale eyes took in the expanse of the common room itself. With a satisfied nod, Cyrene went behind the bar to check the stock of supplies and a thin smirk appeared as both brows rose in surprise.<br>
&quot;Well, this will never do,&quot; without so much as to find out where she would be staying, or even meeting the Queens, she rolled up her sleeves, grabbed a bucket and water, parchment and quill to set off to work.<br>

It was a curious sight, since Ara had never seen anyone work so hard and with such loving care on the old building. <br>

The older woman glanced up from behind the bar, the sleeves of her dark blue tunic rolled up past the elbow.  Beads of sweat dripped from the mass of curls over her brow.  A hand reached back to push the hair off her face, tucking the thick ebon behind her ears.  Pale, depthless azure eyes searched the room as she heard the old hinges protest against the movment of the door.  A bright smile appeared across her features at spotting the dark skinned woman. She wiped a bar towel between her palms.<br>
&quot;Welcome,&quot; her voice held a warm timber, rich and deep for one of her size, just over 5 feet when she was in boots.<br>
Dressed in a tunic and long leather skirt, the tendress seemed to exude warmth and welcome, her eyes showing every bit the deep fires of a hearth, yet betraying nothing.<br>
&quot;By the gods...I'm late aren't I?&quot; she asked the stranger as if the dark amazon would know the answer, or even have a clue as to what she ment.<br>
&quot;The festival, it's tonight...are you going?&quot; Quickly rolling down her sleeves she moved out from behind the bar, brows knit in worry. &quot;I don't even know the way.&quot; Smoothing a few none existant wrinkles in her tunic she walked up to the Amazon.<br>
&quot;I'm sorry, ignore what I just said.  I'm Cyrene, and I'm being rude.&quot; Glancing up at the Amazon she offered a full smile and extended her arm in greeting. &quot;It's nice to meet you Arahuta.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uarahutajiwarli.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arahuta Jiwarli</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/handsm.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Shamaness</span><br>  Posts: 101<br> <font color=#993300>(8/22/02 10:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=387.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The visitor</span><hr size=1> Arahuta took the woman's arm and shook it slightly.  &quot;It is very nice to meet you Cyrene.

<br>
Motioning for Cyrene to get on her horse, Arahuta lead then lead them away from the Tavern and into the woods.  The way to Themiscrya was covered.  And only the amazons could read the paths.  There was no direct way into Themiscrya.  Themiscryans had long learned to not walk in each other's footsteps and take different ways thru the forest to the city.    Ara lead the way with Cyrene on horseback behind her, pushing back the vines and walking around sharp bushes.  Until the found themselves, suddenly hitting a clearing.  Before them was the active city of Themiscrya.  Ara smiled seeing her adopted home.  &quot;Welcome to the City of Amazons.&quot;  She said to Cyrene.  &quot;Looks like the festival has begun.&quot;  Ara could see amazons moving towards the great pavilion.  &quot;We better hurry.&quot;  <br>

The tales she'd heard were nothing compared to what her eyes were telling her now. The sturdy mare shifted under her rider causing the older woman to remember that she was still in the saddle.<br>
<br>
Sliding from the back of the mare, she leaned against the horse as her eyes remained locked on the pavilion.<br>

<br>
Cyrene hardly noticed where she was going in the dark she allowed her gentle mare to find their way back to the tavern.  Finding the common room empty, she wasn't surprised.  The festival was still going, and she couldn't find the energy to stay for a moment longer.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're bones are getting old,&quot; she laughed to herself as she took care of the mare for the night, sending her into the small enclosed area and spending over a candlemark giving the mare a well deserved brush-down.<br>
<br>
Dusting off her hands, the older woman made her way back to the tavern, opening the side door that lead to the kitchen, she hummed a joyful tune under her breath. She allowed herself to finish organizing a few things in the back room before moving out to find the room she'd be staying in while with her new sisters.<br>
<br>
Finding the room wasn't as hard as she thought.  It was simply furnished, which she enjoyed, with a hearth off to the east wall for when it grew cold.  Pleased to find her one trunk of personal items was already in the room, she moved over to it and crouched down to open the chest. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she whispered a thanks to the air, for she had no idea which Amazon to thank for hauling up the heavy chest from the shores of the Black Sea.<br>
<br>
Even though she was tired, she spend some time putting her things away, getting to know the place she would be spending a lot of time.<br>
<br>
Sometime passed and she placed her palms on her hips, a wide grin on her lips as she glanced around the room.  Turning to the window, her smile faded to a grin of hidden sadness. &quot;Well my children, I think you'd be proud of your old Mother..where ever you are.&quot;<br>
<br>
Brows furrowed as she pushed those thoughts from her mind and moved off to get ready for bed, a haunting melody tickling the back of her throat. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenvaria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QueenVaria</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://hometown.aol.com/variaavande/images/tsianina2.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 652<br> <font color=#993300>(8/30/02 5:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=387.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/cristalc15/images/varia3sm.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Next morning</span><hr size=1> Varia hadn't been to the labrys in what seemed like forever.

Looking down into the reflection, the Queen's right brow slowely crooked upward in a sharp slant.  A long arm and slender dark sleeved arm reached out to dance pale digits across the refection causing a small ripple.  <br>

&quot;Something to do with the sea air hitting the mountain air?&quot; Cyrene cast a questioning look at Varia. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenvaria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QueenVaria</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://hometown.aol.com/variaavande/images/tsianina2.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 658<br> <font color=#993300>(8/31/02 4:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=387.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/cristalc15/images/varia3sm.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Curiosity Killed the Cat</span><hr size=1> Varia did jump at that breeze, and she squeaked too.

She eyed once more and then double checked the locks, finding them secure.

<br>
Pushing the thoughts from her mind she shrugged and laughed.  &quot;Well, next time they'll have to leave their name.  I'll leave an offering for them in thanks for helping me dust the tavern.&quot; Offering a salute to the air, the older woman smiled at Varia and moved over to the pot of stew to give it a stir.<br>

The fact was that the immortal hadn't left the tavern.  She had watched for a bit until she decided to materialize.  There was a cry of a peafowl in the distance. Shimmering in the tavern, the Queen of the Gods appeared wearing her sparkling black dress.  The collar of small peacock feathers danced around her pale white neck.  Her eyes danced from Varia and then to Cyrene.  Their blue colour so cold that they were almost white.  "Tho dusting isn't one of my secret passions." <p>~~<<<<<<{{{{@</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenvaria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QueenVaria</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://hometown.aol.com/variaavande/images/tsianina2.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 666<br> <font color=#993300>(8/31/02 10:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=387.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/cristalc15/images/varia3sm.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Curiosity Killed the Cat</span><hr size=1> Varia nodded to Cyrene. "Hungry as Hades," she said. "Though I doubt it was he who graced us with his presence," she chuckled. Then hearing Hera's voice she looked over and gave a smile, wave, and a little bow. "Greetings, Queen Hera," she said, as she sidled on over to a table to have a seat, getting out some dinars to pay for breakfast. <p><html> <center> <font face="vivaldi" size="+2" color="#ff0000"> ~Varia Angelina Avande~ </font> </html></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=cyrene>Cyrene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#993300>(8/31/02 11:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=387.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/cyreneamphipolis/cyrene005.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The sound of silence.</span><hr size=1> Cyrene dropped the bowl she'd just picked up.  Grasping the necklace around her throat, the older woman turned slightly grey, then lost most of the color all together.  With a blink, she stepped back, and closed her gaping mouth.<br>
<br>
Shifting a quick glance to Varia, she gathered two bowls and filled them with the famous brew.  Rabbit stew spiced with onions and curry, thick root vegetables and small bits of hard dried bread. A favorite dish people were known to make a day's detour from their travels to stop at her tavern.<br>
<br>
Without thought she placed the dish in front of Varia, and the empty space beside her near the Queen of the Gods.  Turning back 'round she poured tankards of water, those as well were placed next to the bowls.  A plate of bread and sweet hard cheese between the two bowls.<br>
<br>
Turning her attention once more to the Queen of the gods, pale azure defensive, apprehensive, yet showing no disrespect.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you,&quot; the older woman spoke softly as she accepted the dinars from Varia never allowing her eyes to leave the Olympian's.  After a moment, she found her heart catch in her throat on it's way up to escape the confines of her chest.  She had to break contact from the unearthly gaze and found solace in wiping a quite clean spot on the counter. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenhera.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Queen Hera</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 211<br> <font color=#993300>(8/31/02 11:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=387.topic&index=17>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/lilhera.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The sound of silence.</span><hr size=1> Slowely she turned her eyes to Varia and gave her a greeting, "Hello, Varia."  Then her head tilted towards the tavern keeper who seemed determined to finish her tasks despite the Goddesses appearance.  Hera could sense and see Cyrene's nervousness.  A hard to come by smile attempted to rise her lips, but they moved only ever slightly.<br>
<br>
"I was told that you needed to speak to me," Her voice was cold, despite the genuine attempt at being nice.  Hera's eyes not leaving Cyrene.<br>

Perhaps it was foolish of me.  I apologize for my rude departure at the temple.&quot; She hadn't waited for an answer, instead, she'd gone to Amazon lands to begin her new existence.<br>
<br>
Even though she was nervous, she got straight to the point. &quot;Y..yes, you see.  I have a simple question for a not so simple issue. Something has come to my attention.  The herb Silphium, it, sometimes stops children from being conceived. In Greece, the guard has started to attack herb retails and hedgwitches alike who have been rumored to sell, or use it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Putting the bar towel down she moved out from behind the bar, wiping her palms on her apron.  Drawing closer, she once again met the Goddesses' eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have a way to distribute it by way of Egypt's Northern Coast, and a network of vendors, I've done business for in my years as a tavern owner, who are willing to help. All this and I thought of perhaps hiring guards for the shipments, and asking for volunteer help, here, to make sure it is safely given to those in need.&quot; With this her brows furrowed, thoughts could be seen working behind pale azure.<br>
<br>
&quot;The point to this is.  I belive it should be a woman's right to chose, if she can, whether or not to have children. Yet I am simply a mortal woman.  In your infinite wisdom, do you feel it is right for a woman to chose and to be given the opportunity?&quot; The older woman grew silent, her gaze lingering for a moment, before she bowed her head in humble respect, and awaited Hera's reply. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenhera.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Queen Hera</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 212<br> <font color=#993300>(9/1/02 11:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=387.topic&index=19>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/lilhera.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The sound of silence.</span><hr size=1> The idea that women did not want to bear children was odd to the Goddess of Childbirth.  But it was not foreign.  In moments when she attended a mortal birth, she found that there were mothers who cursed the birth of their child.  When this happened, Hera often left quickly.  <br>
<br>
For a moment, she gazed into Cyrene's eyes.  Almost as if she was reading her from the inside.  "I understand what you are saying.  I do believe that to bear a child is the most wonderful thing in a woman's life.  But, perhaps some women should not find the time right...or even desire this gift.  If a woman is of this manner.  Then perhaps the woman should make the final decision.  I would rather that...then she rip the life from her womb."  Her eyes flashed to the eyelet of a peafowls feather as she said the word. <p>~~<<<<<<{{{{@</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=cyrene>Cyrene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#993300>(9/1/02 11:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=387.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/cyreneamphipolis/cyrene005.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The sound of silence.</span><hr size=1> Glancing away from the goddess in respect, she knotted her hands together. &quot;Thank you for your honesty.

Eyes went wide as her head lifted quickly, &quot;I'm hoping I've not made an assumption in that you won't find anger with me.&quot; Those words came out in a rush of air, as if she really hadn't thought about them before she spoke.  It was rare for the older woman to do such a thing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a
