Suddenly...<br>
<br>
She arrived to a territory she wasn't knowing. Was that the territory of the Thermodontine Amazons?Chadesia?<br>
<br>
Born in a wealthy Roman family in Ephesus,the 18 years old Livia Diana had been promised by her parents to a commander of the Roman Army in Asia Minor, whom she was hating.<br>
<br>
She was dreaming of the free life of the Amazons, to be master of her life. Roman women had nearly no rights and men had all rights on them.<br>
<br>
She entered more deeply in the woods,to freedom, to her destiny<br>

<br>
In Ephesus, Myrene had been her only trusted friend and confident. But a night when she came in the forest, she heard a cry of distress. On the ground was lying her friend, badly wounded. In her last moment of consciousness, she described her murderors and Livia swore that justice would be made. The poor Myrene died in the Artemision, where her fellow priestesses and Livia had hopelessly tried to save her life.<br>
<br>
Myrene's murderors were three Roman soldiers, and one of them was the commander promised to Livia.<br>
<br>
But no Roman trusted Livia's words and there was no proof to accuse Myrene's murderors.<br>
<br>
Livia, to avoid her arranged marriage with this commander who was the murderor of her friend had fled far away.<br>
She wasn't able to talk or to see any of the Amazons without remembering the young priestess. Ashamed of being Roman.<br>
<br>
&quot; Thanks for your warm reception.My name is Livia Diana Tarquinia and my parents are Roman merchants from Ephesus.I fled from home after having been promised to a man I hate, and who have the blood of one of your sisters on his hands,Myrene, a young priestess of Artemis who was my best friend had been brutally murdered in the woods, close to the Artemision by three Roman soldiers, including the man promised to me. Unfortunately, there's no proof of his implication in this murder. Only the last words of his victim I've been the only to witness.I don't know what to do nor where to go and have no place to stay.I'm travelling alone, in no particular way and I'm sorry of entering in your lands,I don't know this territory and have no bad intention against your nation. My only demand, if it's not too audacious would be to be accepted in your tribe. I'm not a warrior and don't know much about your culture and traditions but I want to be the master of my life and learn your ways.To be an Amazon is what I ever wanted, and feel a deep connexion with Artemis that I can't explain, she guided me in my life, now my path sent me to Chadesia and I don't know if it's a simple hasard or my destiny&quot; <br>
<br>
She stopped her conversation, ashamed by her brashness, to make confidences to a queen, whom she didn't even know, like if it was a friend. She didn't knew the Amazon formal courtesies due to a Queen nor their traditions, only the Amazon salutation she had learned from Myrene.<br>

She was missing Octavia, her mother, who loved her. But her father was very authoritarian and wanted to marry his daughter when a man of her class. But he didn't knew that the fiancé he had chose for his daughter was a murderor, blinded by the prestige this marriage to a military commander could have give to Livia.

<br>
She was speaking with her heart and discovered the warrior soul that was living in her, killed by her father's domination and her role as a Roman young woman of good family, had arose, stronger than ever before. As a child, Livia loved to play with her elder brother's wood sword but when her father was seeing her in her sword practices she was severely punished.In her early teenages,taller and stronger than most Roman girls of her age, Livia was loving to practise fighting techniques with his brother's sword and every staff she was finding in the woods. But the worst punishment she ever had is when she revolted against her father on his choice of husband and had been beaten so savagely that she lost consciousness. It had been Octavia, her mother who saved her from his fury, her clothes covered by blood and took care of her.But her warrior spirit never died.After recovering, she took her decision: to flee from Ephesus. In her heart she was an Amazon. She hoped that in Chadesia her father and fiancé would never find her. <br>
<br>
More and more she was hearing the call of Artemis in her soul. Maybe her task was to become a virgin priestess.She had been guided by her to Chadesia, to her true home. But how could she become a priestess when her heart was crying for vengeance, against her father and the murderors of her dear Myrene.<br>
<br>
The time where she was a victim and afraid was over, she was now a warrior, master of her destiny rather than being its victim. Also she wanted to change her appearance and sacrifice some inches of her beautiful dark hair, long enough to reach her hips.Time will act to transform the Roman girl of wealthy family in a true Amazon.If those vermins would seek her in all Asia Minor to bring her back to Rome, they would probably not recognize her. In herself she was saying that if her despicable father and fiancé would find her, it would be them who will regret it.She was trying to calm herself from her desire of vengeance.Maybe peace would come, maybe <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenvaria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QueenVaria</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://hometown.aol.com/variaavande/images/tsianina2.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 446<br> <font color=#993300>(4/20/02 12:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/cristalc15/images/varia3sm.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Livia rides to Chadesia</span><hr size=1> ~Sounds good to me,~ Var said, nodding to Livia. ~Come then, let me get you settled in a hut and get you some food.~ She motioned with her hand to follow her and headed off towards the housing area. <p><html> <center> <font face="vivaldi" size="+2" color="#ff0000"> ~Varia Angelina Avande~ </font> </html></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=robin>Robin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#993300>(4/22/02 8:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Livia rides to Chadesia</span><hr size=1> ~She followed up behind Livia silently, looking around the village.

Feeling finally some peace, her fears left away.<br>
<br>
Her only fear was for her mother Octavia and her 15 years old little sister, Margarita Cecilia she had left away. Her brother also was away, serving in the army. But Livia fled to be free of her life and of her authoritarian and violent father, her mother didn't married by choice.Does he would marry Margarita with the vermin she fled like the plague. Her sister was strong willed and nearly as impetuous as her elder. She regretted so much of leaving her away, but Margarita didn't wanted to leave her mother alone with her father.In her heart, she was praying Artemis to protect Octavia and Margarita, while making her way in Chadesia <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenvaria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QueenVaria</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://hometown.aol.com/variaavande/images/tsianina2.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 457<br> <font color=#993300>(4/25/02 12:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/cristalc15/images/varia3sm.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Livia rides to Chadesia</span><hr size=1> &quot;Okay here we are,&quot; Var said, pointing to the huts. &quot;Are you hungry?

<br>
She was too worried for her mother and sister to be hungry, in prey to visions, she could only pray for them.<br>

She then got to the river, in pray to her thoughts, to pray Artemis <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td
