It was burned and destroyed by an army of men that stormed the village to steal all of it's food and homes.<br>
The kingdom protecting that village fought back the men, but the village was burned to ashes by the time anything could be done.  Sheyala and a few other children were the only survivors, but the others were but baby's and didn't survive.  The Queen herself took in Shey and raised her beside the princess as a guardian.  Sheyala grew up learning the arts of the sword and self defense. Finally as generations changed her princess married and became her Queen and things were peaceful for a time, but it didn't stay that way.<br>
Upon returning from a peace agreement, Shayala, Her Queen, and Her Queen found their castle under siege by centaurs, humans and others alike.  Lead by Tomais the head centaur, Dryisan a mage and Angelus and Vamp, the kingdom was destroyed.  Along With the now mythological creature the Phoenix that guarded it.  <br>
The King, The Queen, and Sheyala's Twins and husband were slain before her very eyes.  She again was the only survivor and as punisment  lives until the day that the souls of the lost are regained.  As, the three trapped them in a phoenix pendant that was broken into 4 pieces.  Sheyala stunned by all of this lie in the snow as she was left to fend for herself.  The dying phoenix the once so bravely protected it's kingdom gave its last powers to her, along with a satchel of its own fiery feathers.  These things gave SHeyala abilites beyond imaginable scale.<br>
Eventually Sheyala regans 2 pieces of the pendant, now owning three herself.  One more pice and she can die in piece and regain those that she sought to revenge. <br>
Soon after finiding the third piece of the pendant, Sheyala challenged the final guardian Angelus and was defeated.<br>
Lost and alone, she was found and taken in by the amazons of Themiscrya where she resides, training, and waiting for the day she can return home and kill the final enemy that stands in her way of eternal rest.<br>

Sheyala, acompanied by her best of friends Sartha a fellow amazon, Madmartigan, and Anya the great White wolf, returned to her home.  Through a hard long battle she defeated Angelus and now holds the whole pendant.  The tortured souls of those that had been trapped were free to flow back to Hades' realm and finally rest in peace.  Through help of her friends Shey drove back the evil inhabiting her kingdom and she now works on rebuilding it.  The phoenix that died to give her power so long ago has been reborn and now lives inside of her.  Sheyala IS the phoenix, but at death the phoenix will be old nough to live on it's own, sheding the fire of light over the kingdom when she is gone.  Solemnly Sheyala promised that after Angelus was gone that the next war would be her last.  She too looks for release and it has been long deserved in her hurt and will to live.<br>

Sheyala is a shapeshifter and does this with ease.  It takes no energy as she has worked with the magic for years.  But, using the powers of the forms she takes drains her considerably depending on what she becomes.<br>
<br>
Sheyala is not an immortal BUT she dies when she chooses to rest, or when she over exherts her magic(see the adept magic) As to the war on the MO board she is mortal. [she vowed one final war ~_^ I plan for sheyala to die on the MO so whomever wishes to be her end in a fair fight IM me(AIM sephykin14) or email me @ randyjerilacey@peoplepc.com thanks!]<br>
<br>
Shey can call the elements, mindspeak, enchant weapons, and heal but these also drain her.<br>
<br>
ADEPT LEVEL-<br>
Sheyala as written above has one power that drains her so much, that it causes her to die--but now without a good effect.  She has the power to summon the great creature the phoenix and she BECOMES it for a time.  But, once reverting back to form, she dies as the phoenix is burned in flame then reborn anew. And so is Sheya's burden. to carry a growing child that feeds upon it's mother when it is born... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm33.showMessage?topicID=25.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm33.showMessage?topicID=21.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm33.emailToFriend?topicID=22.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm33.threadControl?topicID=22.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm33.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=22.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm33.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=22.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm37">The Mythical Odyssey Forum<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitefrm32">The Mythical Odyssey<option value="amazonsunitefrm35">Amazon Nation Alliance<option value="amazonsunitefrm33">Character Descriptions<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm30">Amazons of the Sacred Circle<option value="amazonsunitefrm34">Amazons of Lesvos Island<option value="amazonsunitefrm38">High Mountain Tiger Clan<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm28">Amazon Sisters of Cremni<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm31">Amazon Language<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm33>Character Descriptions</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
