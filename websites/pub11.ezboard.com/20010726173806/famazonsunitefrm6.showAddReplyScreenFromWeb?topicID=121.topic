We are the creators and our own creations, the words and the music, both singer and song.  Our traditions stretch back to the Ancients. A<br>
tradition of dance, of music, of sacrifice of Blood.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then was handed a small ceremonial dagger. It was especially made for this occassion. On the hilt was a Wolf. The symbol of the Scynthians. And on the blade was the Elisian symbol.<br>
<br>
She took the dagger in hand and looked to the couple.<br>
<br>
&quot;Take each one hand and expose it. Your blood shall symbolize the many sacrifices you have made for this night.&quot;<br>
<br>
Eli was first to give her his hand.<br>
<br>
She took it within her own and pressed the blade to the palm of his hand gently before cutting she spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you, Eli of the Elisians take Alysia as your lifepartener. To honor her through all her many trials of the position she holds in this tribe as Queen. Do you promise to let her make her own mistakes, but help her through them as she continues to learn the errors of her ways as we all must. To protect her and love her will all of your being and bless your current and future family.&quot;<br>
<br>
He merely nodded with a smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then so be it.&quot;<br>
<br>
She took the blade pressing it to his palm deep enough to draw blood.<br>
<br>
He cringed lightly, but smiled as he looked towards Alysia.<br>
<br>
Sariah took Aly's hand within her own and pressed the blade to the palm of it gently before cutting she spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you, Alysia of the Scynthian Amazons take Eli as your lifepartener. To honor him through all his many trials of the position he holds as leader of his people. Do you promise to let him make his own mistakes, but help him through them as he continues to learn the errors of his ways as we all must. To protect him and love him will all of your being and bless your current and future family.&quot;<br>
<br>
She nodded. &quot;With all of my heart.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sariah took the blade and pressed it to Aly's palm enough to draw blood.<br>
<br>
Two more Shamaness' came forth with colored ribbons. Sariah took their hands and joined them together. Drops of the blood fell on the ground and a bit down their forearms. She took a red ribbon and tied it around their hands gently.<br>
<br>
&quot;This ribbon represents the blood you have shed this day, and the love in eachother's eyes.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then tied their hands with a blue ribbon.<br>
<br>
&quot;This represents the blessing of Peace upon your marriage.&quot;<br>
<br>
She finished it off with tieing a white ribbon around their hands.<br>
<br>
&quot;This represents the purity of the new union you both shall share.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sariah and the other Shamaness' stood back.<br>
<br>
&quot;May you both be joined in heart, soul, mind and body.&quot;<br>
