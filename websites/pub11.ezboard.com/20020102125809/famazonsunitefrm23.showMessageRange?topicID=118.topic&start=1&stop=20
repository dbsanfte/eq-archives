The sound of trumpets was heard, indicated that an attack was imminent.  A few dozen guards stood their post on the wall and in the tower as they readied their scorpion bows.  In the distance and growing closer, was a single figure.  An enormous figure by human standards, and having horns.  As the image got closer and closer once could see it was a minotaur.  It was carrying a sack over its shoulder::<br>
<br>
&quot;Fire!&quot;  ::Called the captain of the guard on the wall::<br>
<br>
::And with that a few dozen arrows flew towards Mojo.  About half of them successfully hit, however they all seemed to bounce off his skin.  The guards looked nervous as they began cocking their bows again.  A look of annoyance seemed to cross Mojo's face::<br>
<br>
&quot;Fire!&quot; ::Called the captain of the guard again::<br>
<br>
::Now that Mojo was standing right in front of the closed gates, nearly every single arrow successfully hit him.  All of them bouncing off of him, save once, which managed to lodge itself just above his right knee cap::<br>
<br>
::The minotaur growled as he pounded his fist right into the center of the gates.  After punching at it about 5 times, the wood bar behind the gate finally gave as they began opening.&quot;  Mojo then growled again and yelled out, his voice like a roaring thunder. &quot;All I want is to buy some meat and supplies at the market!  Stop attacking!&quot;  <br>
<br>
::And with that, the Spartans on the walls and behind the gates stood there, looking about in confusion.  The minotaur actually spoke intelligably, which they didn't know could happen in their eyes.  Mojo walked right by the guards and immediatly headed towards the market.  The Spartan people, were a bit uneasy.  Though they did not run away in fear as most would.  They were more confused.  'Why weren't the guards killing this beast?', some of the vendors asked quietly as Mojo walked by.::<br>
<br>
::The captain of the guards, leading a small group of about 30 men approached Mojo as he was picking some of the fruit from the stand, trying to find some that was ripe::  &quot;You are not here to attack us?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If I were, this city would have been leveled already.  I really don't want to cause a disturbance.&quot;, ::Mojo responded::<br>
<br>
&quot;You're mere presense causes a disturbance.  Get what you need and leave.  And you will of course pay for the broken gate!&quot;  ::The captain ordered::<br>
<br>
::Mojo's eyes narrowed at the captain as he picked up a fruit from the stand and took a single bite out of it.  He then tossed it to the captain of the guards:: &quot;Well I will just take my business elsewhere then.  I didn't want to shop here anyway, and as far as your gate is concered you shouldn't have closed it on me and it wouldn't have gotten broken therefore I am paying you NOTHING.&quot;<br>
<br>
