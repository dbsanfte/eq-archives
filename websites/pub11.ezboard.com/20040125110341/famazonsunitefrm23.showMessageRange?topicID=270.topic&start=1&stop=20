The invitations were sent out weeks before to all those invited. All the instructions he gave to his servants who are at this very moment carrying out these orders. Aigai is bustling with the trample of heavy feet and the scent of the sea off Aegae in Euboea lingers heavily in the atmosphere. Poseidon takes in a deep breath and savors that wonderful perfume of the sea. It will be little that he sees the sea in the upcoming months.<br>
<br>
At Olympus the hall Poseidon picked to have his feast is set and the last remnants of decoration and the preparation of food and drink are being finished. The sea god leaves his palace and as the doors slam shut behind him the god turns and looks at his home. He smiles and walks off to the stables where he boards the golden chariot. The servants fix his atire and then Poseidon orders the mares to be off. The chariot jerks and shoots out of the stables and pass crowds of animals and immortals and nymphs and many other creatures of his kingdom who wave and cheer the god on as he leaves the kingdom. A few of the faster dolpins follow him up to the surface and swin along the side of the chariot till the mares pull up and off into the sky. <br>
<br>
The islands and land masses spread out from below them and the sea god watches with great anticipation for his journey growing in his chest. No sooner did this anticipation come then when the mares smoothly pull into the stables at Olympus. Poseidon unpacks and leaves the mares some ambrosia. <br>
<br>
The home of the gods is bright and beautiful and Poseidon is pleased when upon arriving at the hall he see the tables set with silk cloths over which golden goblets, plates, pitchers and utensils are set neatly. There are 5 rectangular tables with 6 chairs apiece. One of the best choruses in all of Greece are there chatting with there instruments ready to be heard. <br>
<br>
Across the hall the sea god sees the man he is looking for and walks over to him. They speak for a little while about other things and a few immortals start arriving. as Poseidon sees this he motions to the chorus and they began to play out their gay melodies. Both Poseidon and his acquantance greet the others and the feast has begun! <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uvvvthegoddesshecatevvv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VVV The Goddess Hecate VVV</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.cybercomm.net/~grandpa/euterpe.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 122<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(9/6/02 11:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=270.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.jonathonart.com/LotusMaiden1/dark1s.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Departure of Hecate; Goddess of Sorcery</span><hr size=1> from down in Tartarus Hecate dresses in a sleek silk gown hued in a deep purple and her invitation in hand (assuming she got one)<br>

looking around she spots her dragons  tied to the wall; grabbing the best looking pair she hitches them to her charriot and in her right hand appears a mirror<br>
after a few moments of gazeing she winks and "poof" the mirror was gone<br>
slowly she mounts the charriot making sure her gown didnt get caught and in a burst of speed the dragons were off pulling her up as the earth tore open in front of her and seemlessly shut behind. She had thought to wait and see if her Persphone had wanted to catch a ride with her but at that moment anticipation had taken her captive.<br>
out of the earth she tore through the sky leaveing a trail of dust behind.<br>
shortly though she arrived at the stables and after unhitching her team she stroled through the hallways into the very hall where the feast was to be held. <p><a Target="_top"

He stepped off the path and into the woods, shrugging off the cloak that concealed his broad frame.  He smiled, then in a blink of the eye he was gone.<br>

Lightning and thunder crashed throughout Olympus as if to say in the booming voice of Zeus, &quot;Honey, I'm home!&quot;  He appeared close to the banquet table and smiled broadly.  &quot;What a very pleasant surprise!&quot;  He quickly moved to embrace his wife, planting a kiss on her cheek.

A rather dark and ancient goddess with a unique and captivaing beauty of her own, Hecate, comes into the hall and Poseidon spots her immediately. He sends his friend over to fetch her for him as more important dieties arrive, royalty and the daughters of royalty.<br>
<br>
The sea god strolls over to Hera giving simple greetings of 'Hi's and How's everything' to the immortals nearby. He steps into her presence and then grabbing her tosses her into the air and catches her as she fall back into his arms. 'Glad you could make it Hera.' He then sets her back on the ground smiling. 'You know I will be away for a while, kind of like Zeus(at the mention of Zeus' name the god himself arrives on Olympus) when he takes those long leaves of absence.' Poseidon playful taps he on the shoulder, 'So what's new sister, let us catch up before I leave!'<br>
<br>
At that moment that Poseidon finishes his statement Zeus steps in and plants a kiss on Hera's cheek. The god looks on at his brother and he grins, 'I've not seen your wandering behind in many moons.' he jokes. They clasp hands and shake them. 'It's good that the family is reunited again for a celebration of departure. So what is new with you as well my brother, come speak up I've not seen you and a long time.'<br>
<br>
The clamour of the feast escalates and the music plays dimly in the background. The food is being served and passed out among the guests who are already taking their fill of the potent drinks here.<br>

"Well, greetings to all.  It seems our brother's departure to who knows where has brought out most of Olympus."  <br>
<br>
As one of her children appeared, Hera smiled. But, then it was Eris who quickly walked over and began to flirt with her uncle, Poseidon.  Hera was unsure of these two possible part time lovers.  Any two gods paired together  could mean anything from war, treachory, or just too much drama for that matter.  Hera raised one brow over a pale icy orb as she gazed at the God of the Seas.

Where will your journeys take you?&quot;  He can't hide the smirk as he nods to Bia, his ever constant companion.  He nods in greeting to Eris as well.  Though some would argue that her presence on Olympus was blasphemous, he knew that for everything there must be a balance.  There could be no good without the bad.  This was fair and just.  He absolutely beamed as his eyes settled upon his pride and joy, Athena.  &quot;Ahh, the goddess of wisdom and Athens, does get more beautiful as the seasons progress.&quot;  He hugged his favorite child in greeting.

Poseidon is pleased with what he sees and takes a sip of the nectar. At the moment he removes the goblet from his lips Eris grabs his torso and this causes him to almost jump in startlement. Poseidon almost spits out the nectar onto Hera but catches himself before that happens and a small drizzle of it falls from the corner of his mouth down his chin. With his forearm the God wipes at the moisture there and excepts a kiss from Eris with delight.<br>
<br>
&quot;Eris so glad you too can make it!&quot; She then whispers to him about a present and the god wonders at what it could be, hopefully something worthwhile he thinks. &quot;I can't wait to find out what it is.&quot; he says. His eyes turn back to Hera and Zeus again and he blushes a little while holding the goblet up, &quot;To prosperity.&quot; He then drinks from it again.<br>
<br>
The god decides to continue on with Hera and Zeus from where they left off looking back to Eris often enough while he speaks. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hera I hope my leaving is not cause for celebration.&quot; he laughs. &quot;I just hope everyone is come to enjoy themselves. I know how everyone here is so uptight.&quot;<br>
<br>
Both Zeus and Hera ask Poseidon the same question about his trip and he takes another sip from the golden goblet before continuing. &quot;Well I am going east where the sun rises, to a land in which people are offering me rites of sacrifice, you know how it goes. There are few men I actually can like these days.&quot;<br>
<br>
The god licks his lips and before he can continue Zeus breaks his speech by greeting Athena. Now Athena and Poseidon were not the best of buddies, but he could tolerate her at times. What man could not tolerate one of the most beautiful goddesses in Olympus? &quot;Ah Athena, Zeus' favorite, Aegis bearer, welcome home you modest goddess.&quot; Poseidon dares to give her a kiss, on the cheek that is, he knows how those serious virgins are. <br>
<br>
&quot;We were just talking about where I am soon headed, care to join?&quot; He then remembers about Hecate and looks around but cannot spot her. &quot;I wonder where Hecate is though, have any of you seen her? I sent for one of the cup-bearers to go fetch her a little while ago. I wonder what is keeping her.&quot; He turns back to his company and smiles.<br>
<br>
The sharp cracking of utensils on dishes and cups on cups as immortals taost, and deep throated laughter are all around. Poseidon curses himself for not getting the Muses to play. Oh well, even the gods make petty mistakes.<br>

<br>
Bare feet paded to Zeus and Hera, though she was a Goddess of the older generation, she still bowed before the King and Queen of Olympus. She took two steps back from them after bowing, and took an upright position.<br>

<br>
&quot;The daughter of the great Zeus fairs well as well can be Father.&quot; She smirked. She found it humorous that she and her Father boosted their egos more than anyone could. <br>
Her eyes turned then to her uncle as he dared to kiss the virgin Goddess after the things he had done to her in Zeus' absence. She gave a nod and narrowed her eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well in hopes that you're journeys are LONG and prosperous uncle.&quot; She took a sip of a nearby chalice.<br>
Her eyes then turned to Zeus as he questioned her about Athens. She smirked lightly and spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well Father, I am in the process of raising a young boy to one day rule Athens as King. It's only proper seeing he has Immortal blood in his veins.&quot;<br>
<br>
She gave a look to Poseidon knowing he had such a hand in the attack, and then to Hera, who's son was her violator, and thent o Gaia knowing Gaia knew of Athena's son Erectheus, because it was from the Earth that the child sprung forth. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uvvvthegoddesshecatevvv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VVV The Goddess Hecate VVV</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.cybercomm.net/~grandpa/euterpe.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 123<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(9/18/02 5:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=270.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.jonathonart.com/LotusMaiden1/dark1s.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Feast of Departure</span><hr size=1> while standing in the hall Hecate is approached by a cupbearer speaking so swiftly and low she could hardly hear, his eyes catching glimpses of her every now and then as he anxiously stares at the floor.<br>

She greeted Zeus and Hera yet failed to greet him. Poseidon's heart almost sank and he addressed Gaia with a look of suprise on his face. &quot;Grandmother? No greetings for me? I am quite shocked but I suppose something presses you so that you must speak with these two!&quot; He smiles and shrugs off his disappointment. After that he embraces Gaia in a hug and kisses her cheek. &quot;I'm glad you could find time to come anyway Gaia.&quot; <br>
<br>
Hecate arrives just as Poseidon's thoughts begin to drift from her to making some conversation with the others. He takes her hand into his and kisses the back of it. &quot;Took you long enough Hecate. I was beginning to wonder if you had wandered off.&quot; His arm wraps around her shoulders and he whispers to her, &quot;Come let us sit at that table over there where we can talk alone.&quot; <br>
<br>
Then looing to the others he says, &quot;Excuse Hecate and I we need to catch up it won't be too long. Enjoy the feast.&quot; At his bidding one of Hephaestus' tables rolls over and the God places the empty goblet down onto it. It rolls away and Poseidon urges Hecate to come with him to sit. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ah yes Athena no hard feelings right? It was not my intention that things go about as wayward as they did.&quot; he lied about the Hephaestus nearly raping her. He did not mention the details so that the others would not know of it. &quot;If you need to speak to me please do come and I shall explain myself after Hecate and I are through.&quot;<br>

She looked around, Bia was always alert, far more alert than perhaps others realised as she said little.<br>
She was uneasy.  The golden Dragon which hung around her neck moved, it's head turning this way and that.  It's eyes flashing a piercing red and smoke spouting from it's flaring nostrils.<br>
<br>
Bia's eyes burned like two suns.  There was a prescence, she could feel it,  the dragon felt it too.  Bia made a slow circut of the banqueting hall. She was seeking the perscence she could feel but not see and the voice she could hear albeit in the faintest of whispers.<br>
<br>
This was a place of feasting, a place of happiness.  Bia did not wish it to be less, but she had her duties to perform and anything which even remotely appeared a threat to Zeus and Hera would be sought out.<br>
<br>
&quot;If,&quot; she thought, sending a telepathic message, &quot;the owner of this voice would make himself known, then perhaps all would be well.  It was a good way also to seek the respect it sought.  It need only to assure her that all was well.&quot;  <br>
<br>
As she slowly walked around the room, the dragon became increasingly restless, it's eyes, like Bia's own, shone a warning to any who would tempt her wrath or pose a threat to her Lord and Lady here. <p>~ ~ Bia  Goddess of Force and Power: Warrior and Guardian of Zeus ~ ~
