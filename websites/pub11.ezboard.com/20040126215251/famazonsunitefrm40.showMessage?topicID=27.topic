Softened amber eyes darted back and forth as she looked around her new home. She'd been there for a while, but still everything felt so new to her. Just being around so many other women was a change for her. She hadn't met very many of the other amazons yet, but intended to. She stopped for a minute and looked around, smiling as she spotted where the horses were held. Her smile turned into a grin as she walked over and was greeted by a black stallion trotting up to the gate..her black stallion. Not caring if anyone saw her, she climbed up onto the gate and sat down. The horse put his head on her thigh and like she had everyday in the past, started talking, not caring if anyone even heard what she said~ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uliajivan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lia Jivan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#993300>(4/12/02 8:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/variaavande/images/amandabynes.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A new way of life</span><hr size=1> Lia rode into the village, screeching to a halt when she saw someone.

Lia's mare whinnied at the sight of the black stallion and reared. &quot;Sh*t,&quot; Lia cursed. &quot;You would be in heat when we see a stallion, wouldn't you, girl?&quot; She backed off another twenty yards or so, to the great protest of Victoire, who just wanted to nose up closer to the stallion. &quot;No, Victoire,&quot; she scolded and yanked back on the reins.
