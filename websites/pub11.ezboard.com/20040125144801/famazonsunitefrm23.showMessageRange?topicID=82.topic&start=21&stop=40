<br>
&quot;Yes, powerful in each of our own way. It is true. That still does not make you stronger than me. Specialists are only good in the area's that pertain to them. But my powers, unlike yours, if what you say about yourself is true, is broad. That what gives me power over you. And the Titans, again if it has not been brought to your attention were not overthrown because of dissention within their own ranks but help from others that were different from them. Zeus cannot be overthrown if all the Olympians were to try. But, if like what happened to the Titans, you were to get help from the giants who are not part of the Olympian's sociality he may well be overthrown. That is how the Titans were overthrown not because the people in their society dissapproved of them and wished them deposed but those who were not from within their society did so. They being, the first Olympians and the Cyclopes and Hecatonchires.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He looks up to Apollo.::<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't get me wrong, Apollo, when I said I felt like the ruler of the universe it was just a dream. We can all dream is that not? You being one who has oracles should know that I had no intention of overthrowing Zeus or conspirating against him when I said that. True, one who holds power will do well with friends, this again we saw when Zeus truimped over the giants, who not being part of Olympian society would have  overthrown him because they wanted to rule. Hercules came and saved the day. To say you are more fit to rule than me or Hades however is an insult because it certainly is not true.&quot; <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uposeidonkofc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poseidonkofc</A> at: 6/26/01 4:54:13 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uixlordhadesxi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>IX Lord Hades XI</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 57<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(6/26/01 4:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mount Ida</span><hr size=1> ::The halls of Mount Ida suddenly grew a bit darker and a bit colder as a cold gust of wind seemed to blow through the halls.

This was the first time he heard his name or his realm mentioned in conversation in a long time.  It was this mentioning he heard, and what tweaked his interest in the conversation::<br>
<br>
::He shakes his head lightly:: &quot;You know, things rarely do change.  It seems every so often some of us have the need to get into a hypothetical power struggle.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He turns to both Apollo and Poseidon::  &quot;Time and time again we theorize as to who would make a better leader than Zeus.  And you know the answer to that I always came up with.  No one.  And I'll tell you why.  ::Looking to Poseidon:: True physically you may be more powerful...and I actually think physically you are stronger than Zeus.  But, I'm a lot more cunning, more calculating.  And well, very few can psychologically screw someone up better than I.  But you know what Zeus has over us...the ablility to think on the fly.  The ability to think on the seat of his pants and adapt quickly.  He holds that over us brother.  You remember.  After we overthrew the Titans we agreed to let Fate dictate who rules what.  We drew straws.  I got the Underworld, you got the Sea, Zeus got Olympus.  End of story.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He then turns to the rest of the gods and goddesses present:: &quot;And to answer your question.  Am I happy with what I got.  Not necessarily.  Am I content?  Yes.  I took what Fate gave me and accepted it.  All know it is when I grow angry that the Balance as it is may quake.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He then turned to Apollo and smiled patting him on the shoulder:: &quot;Would you make a good heir to the throne?  Maybe one day...waaaay down the road.  Right now.  Definitly not.  And I will tell you why.  You may have Charisma and you may be liked by the mortals.  But that wavers and wanes because there will be times when you will be forced to make a decision that mortals despise, but you know if for the ultimate good.  I must do that nearly every day as souls enter my realm and head into tartarus or the Elyisian fields.  Your problem is that you lack foresight.  You lack the foresight that even Zeus showed as a youth.  I don't care if you are offended by that or not.

One would figure that the God of Light would look up to someone a bit more bright and youthful. But no, he respected Hades for things that he could not even understand at this point. His eyes then shifted to Poseidon, who at this time, he now loathed. As many did. Poseidon has been angering people for a while now.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dearest Uncle Hades, I agree with you wholly, on most of the point that you have brought up in your opinion. I never said that right now I would make a just ruler. But being the god of Prophecy I know just a bit of how I will be down the road, and I am more like my father than I am willing to admit. ::he laughs:: Right now I am to young and to caught up in myself to rule anyone. And I do not want to, atleast not now. I am content with tending to the bevy of &quot;fans&quot; and what not. Hades I know fame is fleeting, and I thank you for pointing this out to a youth like myself. I respect your opinion above everyones in here right now. And Poseidon, do not take all of this so personally as you have been, or atleast seemingly as of late. This is a hypothetical struggle. It is the dream of all to perhaps one day rule over Olympus, over the heavens, and all it incompuses.&quot;<br>
<br>
He nods to Hades, stepping back, letting the god enjoy his dark, as his own light, would scuffle with the dark, dimming it a small bit.<br>
<br>
&quot;You bring up the Titans time and time again. Yes it is good to learn from the past but it is just that, as I assume Hades will agree. Things change. Inevitablly. Change may not be sudden but it is most certainly drastic over time. Who are we to say that Zeus will never meet his match? Who are we to say that it is not anyone of us in this room right now that may one day over throw him? We cannot tell, and no prophet, no Fate, and no insight can tell you exactly what the future will bring. The future is extremely delicate. A hair falling from my head when I shake it, can alter the future in ways that we cannot fathom! I am in no way able to do as good of a job as ruler as my father. But I hope that one day I might be able to. And perhaps even have the chance to be in his position, as being leader grows tiresome, as many of you might know. Zeus will undoubtebly choose an heir, some eons down the road. I am content with what my father has given me. I am ruler of the realm of light, and the patron of many things. My epithets rival his own. And I know Poseidon, one cannot help but dream. I never said that you had any intension of actually trying to overthrow Father Zeus.&quot;<br>
<br>
He clears his throat and smiles to all. A soft breeze flows through the place as he closes his eyes in thought for a moment.<br>
<br>
&quot;Zeus, and I know this, has thought of many of us as possible threats. Who wouldn't? I know I would. He probably knows enemy number one. And perhaps one day soon he will tell us. Or maybe he wont. For all we know it is someone none of us would think like, Hypnos...or Eros even. We can never say. We do not know what goes on in that mans head.  I for one do not want to know. He is probably a very troubled indevidual.  But I think things as such need to be discussed.&quot;<br>
