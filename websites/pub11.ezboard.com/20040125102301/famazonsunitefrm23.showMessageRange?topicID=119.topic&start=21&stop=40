The rancor of the other immortals has waken him. He yawns loudly as he lifts his arms into the air stretching his body. He drops the rose from his hand and wipes his eyes with his hand, fingers curled up. Poseidon rises slowly from the base of the tree and cracks his neck and knuckles. He walks slowly to the border of the garden without saying a word to anyone else. He notices Hecate, that dark goddess in the corner of his eye. He turns to her for a second and heads to his room. Turning the nob slowly with his left hand Poseidon pulls the door open without a sound. He closes the door behind him as he walks into his bed chamber. Torches from every corner of the room illuminate the dark room and the windows are covered with sea blue shades. Poseidon strips down and puts all of his attire on a rack by his closet in the bedroom, opposite the bed. Taking long strides Poseidon walks to his bed and sits down on the edge. He then falls back with his hands up over his head and his eyes closed. He moves around a little and turns over on his right side holding both palms together under his head. A mist covers his eyes and he falls into a deep sleep.:: <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uposeidonkofc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poseidonkofc</A> at: 7/23/01 3:19:53 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenhera.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Queen Hera</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 129<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(7/23/01 4:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=119.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Demeter</span><hr size=1> Hera watched as her sister moved to her and gave her a warm hug.

Hera's fury and anger were softened by her daughter's giggle.  Maybe Zeus would now see what he has missed in not meeting his daughter soon, she thought.<br>
A little arm reached out and tried to touch one of the balls of lighting, but Hera moved her back gently. &quot;No, Eilie.  You have to be careful sweetheart.  Even the playful lesser powers of the God's can be dangerous.&quot;  She raised a brow to Zeus.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uzeuskingofthegods.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zeus King of the Gods</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(8/5/01 6:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=119.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Love of a Father</span><hr size=1> Zeus smiled at the little one.  Even if he rarely showed it, he enjoyed the fact that his seed had spawned the vast majority of the Olympians and the lesser gods, demigods and heros.  He chuckled watching the little one reach for the lightning ball.  &quot;It is alright, my love, I will not allow it to harm her.&quot;  He gently took the toddlers hand and turned it palm up.  Then carefully placed the lightning ball into the palm of her hand, his powers willed it to leave her untouched as her tiny fingers danced in and out of the ball of energy.  His eyes twinkled as he watched her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uxgoddessaphrodite.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xGoddess Aphrodite</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(8/6/01 9:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=119.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.xenafan.com/gallery/official/aphrodite_02.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> It's beautiful day in the neighborhood </span><hr size=1> ::In a golden flash of light, the goddess of love appears.
