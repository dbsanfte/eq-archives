Etna...</span><hr size=1> ::From the outside, Mt. Etna may seem to be a simple volcano that sporatically  errupts.  However, inside lays the blacksmith forge of the god Hephaestus.  Hephaestus, the God of the Forge, Fire, and Craftsmen and Smiths.<br>
<br>
Inside the forge was dimly lit and quite warm.  The sound of repeated pounding was heard, of metal clanking.  This was Hephaestus hard at work.  The front of the forge was set somewhat nice, a finely carved table and two matching chairs.  Weaponry, armor, and shields adorned the walls of this particular room.  In the back of the room was a big metal door, sealed shut.  It is from behind this door that the clanking and pounding was heard.<br>
<br>
The clanking then stopped and after a few minutes, the door began opening, as this happened, the temperature in the room drastically increased.  Behind this door was the actual workshop, the fires of the forge blazing.  After the door opened, Hephaestus limped out.  Underneath his right arm was a crutch to help him walk.  He slowly shut the door behind him, leaving the cyclopes to continue working on their own without his supervision.  After a few minutes the room temperature cooled back to where it was before.  He then limped over to the finely carved table, which he made himself and sat on one of the chairs.<br>
<br>
He took a deep sigh, as he poured himself a goblet of wine and sipped it.  He looked at his lame leg as he continued sipping his wine.  He slouched in his chair slightly, cracking his back from stiffness.  He stretched his arms out and released a yawn.::<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, that is enough work for now...&quot;  ::His voice a bit gruff, but having a gentleness to its tone::<br>
<br>
::He then stood up and stretched his legs a bit.  He stood about 5' 5&quot;.  He then cracked his knuckles as he stood on his good leg.  His hair was long brown and unkept, very dry and very stringy, same with his beard.  Working in the forge for months on end did that to his hair.  He wore nothing but a simple cloth wrapped around his waist for now, as that is what he normally wore when he worked.  His simple brown eyes looked about his shop.  He didn't realize how long he had been in there working, much longer than he thought.  <br>
<br>
Hephaestus stretched his powerful arms again.  He had a very thick stocky build.  Years of smithing he had developed quite an impressive upperbody strength.  His upperbody, allbeit not very chiseled the way the other gods were, was quite large and impressive.  Years of working muscle as opposed to work-out muscle.  He had not always been this way, when he was young, he was actually quite scrawny and pale.  In his youth he could almost be described as sickly.  He was not very attractive.  He was not quite grotesque and repugnant the way some believed him to, he was just very plain looking, which on Olympus is probably equivalent to being 'ugly'.  The lame leg did not help him in that department either.<br>
<br>
He walked around with the crutch under his arm for a little bit to work the stiffness out and sat back down at his chair, once again sipping from his wine goblet.  The years of mistreatment from his mother, Hera, and father Zeus had actually humbled him as opposed to making him bitter, well not overly bitter anyway.  He already had his revenge on his mother for throwing him off Olympus into the ocean.  And his father, Zeus, he would not dare take revenge for being thrown off Olympus onto the island of Lemnos.  That would be the last time he would step in between an argument between his parents; hell, that would be the last time he stepped on his own without the aid of a crutch.<br>
<br>
As he finished the goblet of wine, he poured himself another glass.  He thought about his wife, Aphrodite.  Being married to her was a double-edged sword.  Yes, he was married to the most beautiful of all the goddesses on Olympus, the one that every other god desired the most.  Which was exactly the problem.  Her unfaithfulness did not bother him as much as it used to, particularly that night he caught both her and his brother Ares in the net.  After that night, he became a bit more numb to it and sort of just accepted her infidelity, though it still did bother him slightly.  He thought to himself...::<br>
<br>
&quot;Ironic how the 'ugliest' of gods ends up married to the most beautiful of goddesses.  Even moreso, the ugliest god creates some of the most desireable and beautiful items.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He looked on the table at the ornate and beautiful diamond encrusted bracelet he recently created.  He then thought about what was probably his greatest creation in his mind, Pandora.  A smile then crept upon his lips as he finished the second goblet of wine and relaxed in his chair.  He earned his break:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uposeidonkofc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poseidonkofc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 235<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(11/27/01 12:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=204.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.tripod.com/~Poseidon64/poseidon3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The inside of Mt.

<br>
&quot;Sun dial says its about noon, and guessing you all haven't eaten I said to myself. &quot;Apollo you should bring them something to eat when you drop by.&quot; So I did.&quot; Apollo smiled and scurried to the large table in the middle of the smithy and dropped a large platter of baklava.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, and Hera said 'Hi' Hephy.&quot; Apollo smirked waving at his half brother.<br>
<br>
Apollo walked around the smithy trailing his index finger over everything as he smiled to Poseidon, and snarled at Hypnos. He had still not made a sacrafice in apology after what he had done. He stopped and looked at his finger, covered in dust.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know Heph, you could get Hebe in here to clean this place. She does umm...wonders for Olympus.&quot; Apollo was such a perfectionist it even got on his nerves sometimes.<br>

Few of them she enjoyed, others she tolerated.<br>
<br>
She gave a nod to Poseidon in respect of his being elder than she, though the two had never shared ideals, they had that mutual respect for each other's power and wisdom.<br>
<br>
Her attention was then turned to Hephaestus. She and Hephaestus were born rivals of one another. She being born of Zeus and he being born of Hera.<br>
<br>
Though she admired his skill from afar and respected his many efforts in gaining his mother's love, Athena was always weary of the smith God. Little did she know of the future the two of them would share a child.<br>
<br>
He had always loved her and even asked for her hand in marriage before he asked for Aphrodite. Zeus' care for his favored daughter forced him to reject Hephaestus' request for Athena as his wife.<br>
<br>
From the moment she sprung from her father's head, Hephaestus persued her. Athena thought she had been rid of his desires when he married Aphrodite, sadly she was mistaken.<br>
<br>
She approached him with a light smile. Her grey eyes reflected somewhat in the dim light.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hephaestus, I have come in need of your help. I am in need of a new spear. My old one has perished from use and I was wondering if you would construct me another.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled lightly knowing well he would not refuse. Payment for such an object on the other hand was curious.<br>
<br>
(Note: For those who don't know, Athena's asking for a spear is the beginning of the birth of Erichtonius. For those who don't know what that is, read up on your Mythos!)<br>
