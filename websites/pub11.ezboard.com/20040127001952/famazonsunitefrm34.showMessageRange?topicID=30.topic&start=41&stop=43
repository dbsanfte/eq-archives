Every so often, she tossed him a lil, he ate it happily, she took, sucked down a few pieces, slurping the stringy ones like spighetti. When done, she had a neat little pile. She took the eyes and popped them, taking only the important nerves within it, and added them to the pile. She then threw the mushy remains into a box with some sage, devilsshoestring herb and various others, mixing it together, then mushing them together until she had a liquidy mess. Mora had found out everything she needed to know, and really had no use for the concotion any longer, she was just bored. She placed a few fingers in and scooped out a large amount, and ate it, then placed the box on the ground. Her three wolves came from the shadows, had a snack, then headed to bed.

Tragic and gruesome, but no less than was intended for the Amazon sisterhood. In time, stories would tell of the wealthy woman and her travels. Many would assume some tragic fate befallen upon her, unaware how true that was. Those within the Nation would know of her downfall at Lesvos. Her inherited lands of great vineyards fallen into poverty. Her loyal field workers given to any labor to provide, those who had not been hunted down along with Diaprassea relatives for any information on the dark goddess, would curse her name and its bad fortune. The time of Hope Diaprassea had drawn to a swift, tragic close... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugabbyshope.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GabbysHOPE</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(6/22/02 9:18 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/gabbyshope/images/hd1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Conclusion of the Hope Diaprassea Storyline</span><hr size=1> The Vineyards   . . . . The Diaprassea family vineyards and modestly sized orchard groves saw many continued years of prize winning wines and fruits used for flavoring. Ownership changed frequently between distantly related family members, neighboring competitors and wealthy connoisseurs. It was said the lands were even once owned by a retired Roman commander seeking peaceful years after loyal service to the Empire. Many soon learned the Diaprassea lands would provide nothing of peace. The vineyards held a certain quality that brought hesitation when mentioned by people. So many owners had fallen to misfortune associated with its ownership in so many different and tragic ways, speculation quickly spread of the lands as being cursed. Long after the disappearance and rumored death of Hope Diaprassea, owners were still unable to keep continuous employment among the field workers. Sometimes the workers come up missing.<br>
<br>
The Family   . . . . The extended Diaprassea family was for the most part wealthy and as with Greek families there were many relatives. Hope's adoptive father, Gulianno Diaprassea, was the third son of four children. His oldest and younger brother both tried to gain possession of the vineyards, but the younger brother fell ill with unexpected flu and soon passed away. The eldest brother had two sons of his own who took turns running the vineyards. One lost his life to a crazed field worker who had been cursed by the nearby dark forest. Later rumors suggested he was singled out by a group of concerned workers who blamed the family for all the problems and deaths. The second brother died years later in his sleep, somehow smothered by bedding blankets wrapped tightly around his neck. No person had been seen visiting the Diaprassea home at that time. Hope's adoptive mother, Cecilia Remourno-Diaprassea, was one of three children of her own family. Cecilia's second nephew had purchased the lands to finance his modest shipping trade business along the Ionian Sea. It was said he died in the fires which consumed his trade vessel as it lie just off the coast of Diaprassea lands, again, not far from the dark forest.<br>
<br>
The Search . . . . Hope Diaprassea was known to enjoy travel to distant lands. After several months however it became apparent something had went wrong. Field supervisors, opting for her favor, sent workers to locations she had mentioned before. Some went to the temples devoted to the god of war. They returned with no helpful news. Some ventured into what had been known as Saurian lands. They returned grateful for escaping the lands though some were lost. Some traveled across the Ionian Sea to see if she had returned to Rome, but they returned with no news to confirm this belief. And there were those who traveled into the Amazon lands. One of the field supervisors Gregori Vespia had remained loyal to Hope's adoptive family since her early childhood. He had led a group of over two dozen men into the lands of the tribal sisterhood. Survivors of the expedition credited most of the tribes as reserved but hospitable; however, there were tribes not so welcoming. Most of their men died there, and as no outsiders had ever been allowed to map the entire Amazon lands, it was difficult to assign blame to any single tribe. In the months and years afterwards, the workers and field supervisors decided against further efforts. They actually ran the lands themselves for a time before Diaprassea family members asserted their property claims.<br>
<br>
The End . . . . There were one or two vineyard workers, who had traveled the Amazon lands, who knew of Lesvos. They suspected the island as Hope's last visit. But the word of these men in taverns serving much ale and mead were easily ignored by the next amazing story of daring and adventure which always seemed to fill such places. Hope Diaprassea's name would eventually be forgotten, as were countless hundreds of thousands of people who had lived during ancient times. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table>
