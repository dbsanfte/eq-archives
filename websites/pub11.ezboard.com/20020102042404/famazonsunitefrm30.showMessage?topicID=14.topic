Blowing an icey chill through the village, a hallow howl filled the air.  But this howl was unlike the wolves, or wind.  Hidden within the shadows eyes lite up like a thousand fire flies; golden yellow, with a small slither of a pupil in the middle of each one.  The howl came again with another passing of the wind.  This time more clearer than the last, and in the distance, the beating of drums was heard.  <br>
<br>
To any non-amazon, it would sound just like thier customary tribal music beat.. but this one was scattered around the the village, within the forest around them.  Its tune was darker... and much more violent than any amazon songs.  It was a song of summoning, and death.  Like a signal, or becon.  <br>
<br>
The eyes all looked towards the beating of the drums, and from the trees and into the village roof tops, a dozen saurian spies sprung out.  As if they came alive from the shadows, each one snarled and hissed at the amazons below, snapping their talons and teeth at them.  The turned towards the drums and sprinted from roof to roof, tearing them up in the process with thier dreaded talons.  Several of them run through the streets with amazing speeds...slashing away at anything in thier way, bringing down horses within seconds.<br>
<br>
Each saurian scattered back into the woodworks, leaving behind quite a mess.  Though no amazons were hurt, it's come to realization that they have been spied on by these lizardmen for an unknown amount of time.  As each saurian dissapears from view, the drums begin to stop.  There was a dead silence, and everything was calm.  <br>
<br>
But something stood at the village entrance... a large flag, with a picture of a sun blocked out by a Dark Moon, with 3 slash marks through it... the symbol of Varsith, city of the Saurians... A symbol of war.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> QueenPallas</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(8/23/01 4:33:59 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Queen Pallas Summons the Goddesses</span><hr size=1> Queen Pallas looked at the flag. Shaking her head, she removed the flag from her villages entrance. With her head bowed in respect, and her arms open, she began chanting to summon the Goddesses. <br>
<br>
Kel to began to join her in the chant, along with the other Amazons of the Sacred Circle. Their powerful voices rang to the high heavens of Mount Olympus. In a shower of powerful radiant light, the Goddesses began to materialize.<br>
<br>
Hera, Athena, Artemis, Hestia, and Demeter stood before the Amazons. Pallas handed Athena the Saurians flag. Athena looked to Hera and shook her head. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Pallas bowed. &quot;We are not Amazons of War... bless this sacred space for us,&quot; Pallas asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;We will do more than that, you have our undivided protection and blessings. No creature, Amazon, Man, woman, God or child, shall declare war on the Amazons of the Sacred Circle. To do so, would go against the Goddesses of Mount Olympus. You have my word,&quot; Athena said to Pallas.<br>
<br>
Pallas bowed. Artemis broke the flag, and the Goddesses disappeared. Kel stood next to Queen Pallas. &quot;Looks like something is trying to make war inevitable... Ares maybe,&quot; Kel questioned?<br>
<br>
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Pallas remarked.<br>
<br>
The tribe started a festival to ease Queen Pallas's mind... however, she was worried that someone would be brave enough to go to war with the Goddesses of Olympus. She sat down and watched her tribe dance and be merry. Kel comforted her wife. They decided to wait and see what time would tell.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :| --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/indifferent.gif ALT=":|"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=queenpallas>QueenPallas</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#993300>(8/23/01 4:43:07 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Queen Pallas Restores Order...</span><hr size=1> After the nightly Saurian attack, Queen Pallas ordered the Amazons of the Sacred Circle to restore order. She sent Phyphen, one of her comrads to fetch new horses for the tribe. By nightfall again, the nation was restored. <br>
<br>
Queen Pallas built a fire and sat down next to her tribe. They all began to talk of times when Harmonia, the Great Amazon Mother, once had a hand in Amazon affairs. Kel laughed at Pallas as she talked of the stories of the Great Ancient Amazons... especially Hippolyte, who fought, so that their sisters would not have to...Kel and the others enjoyed their night together, then retired until the next day break. <br>
<br>
The Goddesses of Olympus kept careful watch over the Sacred group of Amazons... Let no Human, Creature, or Beast dare challenge the Olympian Goddesses....  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm30.showMessage?topicID=9.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm30.showMessage?topicID=6.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm30.emailToFriend?topicID=14.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm30.threadControl?topicID=14.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm30.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=14.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm30.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=14.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm37">The Mythical Odyssey Forum<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitefrm32">The Mythical Odyssey<option value="amazonsunitefrm35">Amazon Nation Alliance<option value="amazonsunitefrm33">Character Descriptions<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm30">Amazons of the Sacred Circle<option value="amazonsunitefrm34">Amazons of Lesvos Island<option value="amazonsunitefrm38">High Mountain Tiger Clan<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm28">Amazon Sisters of Cremni<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm31">Amazon Language<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm30>Amazons of the Sacred Circle</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
