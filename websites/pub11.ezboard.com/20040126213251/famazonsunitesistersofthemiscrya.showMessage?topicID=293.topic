Her heart felt torn... too many things were happening lately. Her long golden-brown hair was swept back and up, restrained by a black ribbon. She sighed and stood, ready to turn from the lake, reaching out to feel for other life forces when she felt it- the pull of death. Someone had recently been killed... She smelled the air... blood. A mixture of two different types. An Athelfi? Her feet were suddenly spurred into motion and she took off across the grasses and into the woods. It took little time for her to find the source, but when she did she gasped- not from fear or sickness, but from surprise. There before her lay the body of Delilah::<br>

Sartha knew, better than many perhaps, that Delilah was a powerful goddess. Who had the power to do something such as this? Without another thought, Sartha pulled her Athelfi into her arms and started off towards Themiscrya::<br>
<br>
::She passed through the village, getting startled glances thrown her way. She walked to the fields just beyond the village and gathered wood. A funeral pyre was built with little effort, and she layed the dead goddess upon the pyre and lit it. As Delilah's body was consumed by the flames, Sartha's voice carried the burial song throughout the village of Themiscrya. Another Athelfi lost...:: <p>~The old days are gone.

Her and Del had carried on a few nights of conversation, and the amazon had assisted alot in the building of Orio-pata. She was a great loss.. one that even the gods should feel. <br>
<br>
 Once the funeral pyre was lit.. Dawn kneeled, pulling her sword, shoving it into the earth. Emeralds fell shut, as her hands clasped around the top of the hilt. Leather clad legs fell comfortably to the dirt. Single tears rolled from each eye.<br>
<br>
 The nation had lost something special..and half of them would never know it.. never recognize it. But they had.. she was truly powerful and some were stupid enough to over look it, because she was a goddess or because they were in destiny of power they could never receive.<br>
<br>
 Whatever it was.. the nation wouldn't be the same. Dawn only hoped..someone noticed that.<br>
<br>
 Eventually Dawn stood, leaving her sword at the head of the funeral prye, solid in the ground. Emeralds glanced upward into the flames.. her heart pounded..as if it were in her throat.. and all she could do was stare. <p>

&quot;No, Athelfi. Not as of yet. No journeys this time. First, I shall discover what happened before I jump in. Too often have I run blindly into situations I know not of. This time, preparation is what I need. Knowledge. I'd be a fool to try and face one who can kill an immortal without knowing what it was I faced. Also, I believe it will be some time before any of us discover this cowardly being who took the life of our Athelfi, no matter how hard we search.&quot;<br>

::She sighed and shook her head. A fist was clenched, eyes closed. She vowed she would find this assasin, but in time, when a confrontation was inevitable, as she knew it would be. For now, she would only wait on the coming of morning and the sacred ashes she would gather at that time:: <p>~The old days are gone. You can't live in the past, and you can't wait for the future. Now is all we have. You do the other two, you waste your life...
