Each breath was painful and it took a lot to try and ignore the fact.  The wound that was given by Pentheslea had been deep and ragged.  The true warrior had been making sure her attacker would feel the blade.<br>
The Themiscryan vasilissa had been told the whole story.  She knew it was a mistake.  She would not hold her athelfi for any wrongs in the sitiuation.  In fact, she had sent an amazon to find Pentheslea.   The Warrior Queen had been missing since the end of the war.<br>
Hippolyte had heard many other brave stories of the war.  And for one of them....and her own situation....she had requested that DeLerium be asked to come to her hut for a talk.  <br>
Again she took a deep breath and winced, then her brown eyes glanced over at Gabby who was busy working on her scrolls.  A soft smile feel upon Hipp's lips as she watched her long partner scribbling away. <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

DeL was fad to know the Queen was doing okay. She nodded to the messanger and got up fom her writing desk. ~<br>
<br>
~Stepping outside DeL took in a deep breath of the crisp air that she loved so much. She walked down the steps and down the path a bit that seperated Hippolyte's hut from her own. Once there..the Guards at the door let her in.~<br>
<br>
~She stepped through the doorway and took notice of Gabby, she went over to her quietly and blewon the back of her neck making her jump sky hi. DeL lauged quietly as she walked softly to where Hippolyte lay waiting for her. Once here she smiled softly down to her Queen. She then knelt besides her bed and kissed Hippolyte on her forehead.~<br>
<br>
You wanted to see me Hipp? ~ she asked as she sat back on her heels.~ <p>         ~~* DeL *~~

A soft chuckled came from her lips, and then a bit of a groan from the pain it caused her wound.<br>
The kiss upon her forehead was sweet, Hipp thought.  And turned her brown eyes up to meet  <br>
"DeLerium...." her voice was a bit weak...but you could hear the strength behind it.  She was only being careful not to irritate the wound. ".....you have always been like a daughter to me.  And I know that you have put Themiscrya deep within your heart and soul."<br>
Her eyes were serious as she gazed into DeL's.  "I know I have daughters...but Diana is very busy in her own world.  And Tasha has sought a different path." Her lips quirked into an odd smile. "And Theseus... he will have to find his own kingdom one day."  She winked over at Gabby and then turned her eyes back to DeL.<br>
"In the old days, when the amazons began....there were two queens.  Each tribe was ruled by two queens...that way the tribe would never be without a leader.  And we have seen time and time again...when there are those outside..who have placed a bounty upon my head.  Or ....in this last case.. I was no longer able to ride and finish a war.....In the old days."<br>
Hipp took another deep breath as a pain spintlered into her side.  "DeLerium.......I want you to take up the name of Vasilissa at my side.  Until, I see you stand firmly in your spot and have a true handle on the reigns....you will be my second.   Then when you seem ready....you will stand firmly beside me.    For now.. you will continue your place as my RoC.  But, as soon as I feel I am able to walk.  You shall have your corination...receive your golden belt....and be known as Vasilissa DeLerium." <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

She never through in her wildest dreams that this is what Hippolyte wanted to talk to her about. She knew she would be a Queen one day, but she never knew it would be like this. But to be a Queen at the side of Hipolyte instead of being the queen instead of Hippolyte sounded alot better to her. so, she smiled to her.~<br>
&quot;I dont know what to say t this Hippolye, this is quite a shock to me. And we all know, it's got to be something big to shock me. Wow, of course I wll rule with you. You are the only mother I have ever known, and because of that, when I become Vasilissa, I would alo be honored if you bestowed upon me, a proper amazon name. &quot; ~ she smiled~ &quot;DeLerium is all fine and well, but, its not a real name. I've never met my real mother to let me know what my real name was.&quot; ~she looked at herith soft sea green eyes~  <p>         ~~* DeL *~~

Now go.....and think much of your future as a ruler of the proud and ancient city of Themiscrya."   Her smile was soft as she gazed up at DeLerium, but showed she needed rest to heal.

She was gratefull of everyhing the Queen had taught her since comming to Themiscrya, heh,even teaching her to use utensils as she ate. ~  I will go let you rest and heal. And if you need anything, pleas, dont hesitate to ask me. ~ She stood up and leaned down to kiss Hippolyte on the forehead,he saluted her and walked out. Though, she couldnt resist, on her way out, a Gabby stood up and stretched, Del, jokingly went over to her and goosed her, then ducked from the hut~ <p>         ~~* DeL *~~
