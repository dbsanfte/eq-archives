He was bare of the emblems he usually carried around but still was a power to be reckoned with by any being in the cosmos.<br>
<br>
Then he stood before the goddesses, his shadow hidden in their shadows and he smiled to them all before taking a seat next to Gaia and letting his arm rest on the seat behind her. A sigh passed his lips and he said &quot;Well ladies nice of me to have dropped in on you! I hope I'm not intruding I just want to hang out for a bit with some of my favorite immortals, you do not mind do you all?&quot; <br>
<br>
A bit of playfull mockery stressed on certain words in his questions and he was almost resembled to a mortal man in a dimly lit room where none could see but a few feet before them.

&quot;I knew it. I knew I smelt the foul stench of a god or two..&quot; But while taking notice.. &quot;Or make that three or four.&quot;  The odds of course were against her,but being as she was,she hadn't a care in the world.<br>
<br>
Her eyes drifted to look at Gaia alone. &quot;Oh my god,is that Gaia? Mother of all things.

The crickets chirping, the nightingale's singing, any nitghttime creature who made a sound, she would hear in her ears. For She was the Night, and no mortal or immortal had the power to break her own magick...It would end itself if the child Vital left the tavern, or when Nyx herself left.

He could not help but laugh, too bad the little mortal female could not hear him cause he would have loved to frustrate her in this act. However since what was done was done Poseidon turned his gaze on Nyx and grinned. <br>
<br>
&quot;That was not so nice Nyx, for either you or her. I'm not one to interfere in anothers ways but it was indeed funny to cut her off like a wetted torch.&quot; His eyes gazed into the black orbs of Nyx and they were like a pool of smoothed out tar. <br>
<br>
He did get to her question however and fell into a stupor like pose, &quot;All goes well insofar as things go.&quot; he joked partly. &quot;Some old same old, the usual bit with me with an adventure here or there. I hardly catch you about any other place than Tartarus though Nyx. This is quite the suprise for me!&quot;<br>
<br>
