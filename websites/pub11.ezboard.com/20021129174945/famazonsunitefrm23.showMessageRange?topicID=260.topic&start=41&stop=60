Yes, it were very possible for Hypnos to be replaced. It would be very easy to dispatch this lesser god who thought quite highly of himself, and she held was the only one out of the bunch that held that power, given to her by her father, a power she did not like to use, but would use if it meant peace. Lesser gods seemed to be replaced quite often, and if she had it her way, she would have him replaced as well, however, it was not her job or duty. Artemis had watched the whole thing with bored eyes. She knew how Hypnos was going to act...like a glorified bafoon. His little war that ended with no winner , with the amazons had little or nothing to do with this trial, but ofcourse, Hypnos seemed to be obsessed with her amazons, who could blame him actually. She said nothing tho, she only watched her brother and Uncle. She had said all that was needed to be said to him a long time ago. She grew tired of Hypnos...he was an annoying insect that buzzed around everyone's ear until they swatted it away...or sqwashed it. She hoped someone had the swatter around handy.~<br>

&quot;Hypnos, whether you came by will or force means nothing to your case here. For you have been in our pressence mere moments and have already tried to use your powers against direct daughters of our Mother Gaia whom serve Olympians and mankind alike verywell. You've made yourself out to be irreplaceable and seem to look at yourself higher than that of what you are. We all have our place here Hypnos. Poseidon watches over the Seas, Apollo the sun, Hades the underworld, and I try my best to keep justice in the world fairly. However, you use your powers against those of which you should be helping. Sleep is a great power and mortals need it greatly to live.&quot; She sighed. &quot;But your ego has become greater than the powers of which you posses. You were not to be tried for your actions against the amazons, however since you've brought it up we shall now hold that against you as well.&quot; She stared at him.<br>
&quot;You willingly began a war against mortals and immortals alike. Turned the Gods against one another and because of your hatred for a few women, much blood was spilled. You've disgraced Olympus and the Heavens all together.&quot;<br>

She looked to Gaia and nodded in respect.<br>

&quot;The Earth as well. This world was not created for your pleasures. We are Gods and Immortals, we are not here to destroy all that our Mother Gaia and Father Uranus created.

&quot;Athena wait!&quot; he said &quot;Hypnos is to be tried for his abuse of power though he did do such a thing with the amazons. If he is to be tried for that than all else who participated in that war, fighting by his side, myself, and Hecate included must be tried too. That is not the issue at hand now, defeat was punishment enough for our actions though some of us, Hypnos in particular, has not learned his lesson. So he is to be tried, him and his minions for power abuse after the war till the present, even as he does so now.&quot;  <br>
<br>
His gaze shifts from Athena to Hypnos and then the immortal lord speaks words of warning, &quot;Mark my words Hypnos, this is a trial and yet you still make a show of the powers you have. If you want to make it a spectacle to impress some person here then be warned that I shall cripple you for eternity, more so than Hephaestus.

Poseidon could not help but to acknowledge this thing that Hypnos wanted to have a play at, and a 'hmph' sound was heard from his throat. <br>
<br>
Then not too soon afterwards, Hecate came in, and as she touched him in that way many another women had done he shuddered, but kept his composure as she walked off away from him. He watched her and in his head he wondered what she was doing here at the trial. It was open for all to witness but Poseidon did not think anyone ot thing would really come. In any case the heart of the matter grew again in his breast and he turned his attention once more to Hypnos.<br>
<br>
This time he spoke from where he sat, in his authority, and did not let his tongue slip but he did speak what he felt was happening here.<br>
<br>
'You Hypnos, though a lesser god are not a weakling, for even among the Olympians there are some who have been shamed by mortals and lesser immortals alike,' by this he was referring to Ares and he said it in a humorous way but in all seriousness. 'Though I would think you are wise enough to know that there are a great many of the Olympians who's powers are nearly indomitable by others.'<br>
<br>
Poseidon took a breather and thought there was some animosity between to immortals goddessess present who in their own rights were nearly equals, at least in his thought. Then he spoke the truth to Hypnos about the situation at hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now sleep god, you are right and wrong you have a defense but have no defense because you as we and you know are guilty of the crimes we have charged you with, and a withstanding punishment will be laid out to you here and now.<br>
Hypnos you are held guilty of the above crimes: 1) Taking your rights to another level, a level that went beyond your rights, such as humiliating or in some way, shape or form seeking to humiliate others by your powers. 2) Being the ring leader of uprising which disturbed or were meant to in any way, shape or form to disturb the peace. 3) And last but not least refusing respect the dignity of your superiors.' He looked on Hypnos sternly and said, 'So how do you plead to these lord Hypnos?'<br>

&quot;Enough!&quot;<br>
<br>
::The entire Underworld shook as Hades' anger had finally boiled over.  He raised his fist again and the Underworld shook harder::<br>
<br>
::At the place where the Olympians were meeting and having this &quot;trial&quot;, the ground shook.  It started splitting open as Hades, in all his glory emerged.  His pale skin and white hair, were offset by his black toga, and his obsidian eyes.  The silver circlet around his head was a go between on the colors.  Hades could usually be more subtle and emerge from the shadows.  Not today.  He wanted to make a statement.  And he was here to make it::<br>
<br>
&quot;Enough!&quot;  ::He growled at the Olympians::<br>
<br>
&quot;I can not allow this mockery to continue any further!&quot;<br>
<br>
::Hades rarely got involved in Olympian politics, but they were now messing with somebody under his jurisdiction.  After all, Hypnos' permament home was in the Underworld::<br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you to pass judgement upon Hypnos?&quot;  ::He looked at every single being in the room.  His voice was cold, dark.  As Hades' mood grew darker, so did the lighting in the room::<br>
<br>
&quot;There are but three people who remotely have any right to pass judgement upon anyone.  And they sit right there.  ::Hades then pointed directly at the Erinyes::<br>
<br>
&quot;So apparently Hypnos is on 'Trial' for causing a War among the Amazons?  Disrespecting 'elder' gods?  Overstepping his bounds?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well if causing public disturbance is a crime, burning the earth and causing war is a crime, then why is not Ares on trial.  Secondly, I have seen many instances where 'younger' gods have overstepped their bounds and insulted the 'elder' gods, and have gotten nothing more than a mere slap on the wrist.  And as far as overstepping bounds?  How EXACTLY did he overstep bounds?  If I'm not mistaken, he stayed within in jurisdiction as the 'God of Sleep'.  He gave many people a dream?  Do not all of us in some way, shape, or form use our gifts to manipulate mortals, as well as other?  And if any god or goddess has a personal beef with Hypnos.  Take up with Hypnos ALONE.  There is no need to hold council and condemn him for his action.  Now if I have misconstrued any facts or misunderstood something, now is your time to explain.&quot;<br>
<br>
::Hades was pacing around the room as he spoke his piece.  He then stood in the center of the room folding his arms.  The room got darker and darker as he spoke.  The fact that some of the gods radiated prevented darkness from completely engulfing the room::<br>
<br>
::Hades eyes once again gazed around the room.  When his gaze fell upon Gaia and Poseidon, a sneer seemed to cross his face.  The fact that Poseidon, was doing everything in his power to kiss her arse angered him.  He did not, nor would he ever, trust his grandmother Gaia.  He refuses to remember her attempts to overthrow the reign of the Olympians, by sending the Hechadonchiries as well as other monsters to fight them.  As far as he was concerend Gaia was a washed up ex-goddess trying to reclaim former glory by undermining her grandchildren:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uposeidonkofc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poseidonkofc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 322<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(7/22/02 1:26:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=260.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://web.uvic.ca/grs/bowman/myth/images/haifa/h89.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Wrong Court of Appeals</span><hr size=1> Poseidon was not in the least bit shocked when Hades appeared and why would he not be, Hypnos was after all his subject! But being brothers neigh equal in power and equal in dignity, even with Zeus would not be enough to let Hades alone put an end to the trail. <br>
<br>
When Hades finished Poseidon patted Gaia's hand, smiled at her and rose to confront his brother. There, standing toe to toe the two looked almost like twins but for a few differences in the paraphernalia they wore. A grin showed on Poseidon's face, masking his true feelings, for he was slightly embarrased and indeed taken aback.<br>
<br>
His voice rolled as he spoke the words &quot;Brother its nice of you to come and stop by, but where's my hello? You seem to have forgotten your manners Hades, perhaps that is Hypnos' influence, you. But the blame for his foolishness is not on you, his crime is his own to hold.&quot;<br>
<br>
The God looked at Hypnos and then smiled evilly at him, then he turned his star-bright gaze on the dark God of the Underworld.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry bro, but it is not enough, we are the high Gods and goddesses of the Olympians, that is whom we are to make and pas judgement. Besides..&quot; and with his finger he poked Hades in the chest, &quot;you are not an Olympians by your own choice so do not come here now seeking to be the mediator of one who must be punished for hs crimes because you need him to do a job.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then Poseidons demeanor became serious and in all seriousness he spoke. &quot;Brother, I know things have happened of like to that which Hypnos has done, but Ares has paid in due retributiion for his folly in his defeats by both mortals and demi-gods alike and I'm sure I need not remind you of this. And these other beings you speak of have paid their debt by punishment by whomsoever they upset amongst us. But Hypnos is one of the greater of the lesser Gods and thus his needs must be met with a much higher and profound justification. Thus we, the Olympians must try him in accord with justice.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then Poseidon stopped and stared and waited for the response of Hades. <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i>Edited by: <A
