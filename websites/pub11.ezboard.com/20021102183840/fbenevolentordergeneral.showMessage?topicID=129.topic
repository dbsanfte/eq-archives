I think once a person hits 10 they should be able to join our guild.  I know many will disagree but this is how I see it.  When Em first started this guild guess what level she was?  She was level 16 I believe.  She then invited Kiglan who was level 12 and myself who was level 8 at the time.  This was in Early January of 2000. Now just because most of the guild is high level doesn't mean that there cannot be a lower level bunch in the guild.  This is an issue I have been thinking of while I have been afk for 5 months. (DOH!)  I have been on about 10 times in that span of 5 months <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and I have joined another mid level guild called Black Magic.  I did that because I would always have someone to group with when I logged on the very few times.  I have been wanting to join the benevolent order again since I quit in april when school ended.  After reading some of the rules and the little civil war so to speak on people quitting and such.  I haven't decided if I should join.  The Ben Order has become a guild of high level people who snub the lower levels.  Big deal they don't play as much EQ as the rest of you.  Doesn't mean they should automatically be put in the can't join area.  This is one of my pet peves in this game where people limit their guild recruiting to a high level/all I do is play EQ rule.  Just remember that EM, Kig and myself were in this guild way before anyone ever hit level 20 and it worked out fine.  Just have the lowbies plan their own raids etc.  If you want to pull yourselves away from your 50hours straight of burning out on EQ and help the lowbies out then go ahead.  I feel that if the limit is set to 20 the guild will stop growing and people will start to quit out of pure boredom.  I have nothing against any of you but this rule sucks.  I have been playing EQ since december of 1999 and have only logged in total between 3 chars being Faadno (my primary) Senladar (my old level 14 sk) and Senladaer my current secondary level 9 warrior for about 20 days of playing.  Faadno has 14 days and the other 6 were done on other chars.  Now check your /played and see how much time you have spent on playing a sur-real persona and then add all of your chars up.  That is what I am talking about.  Keeping newbies/lowbies out of the guild goes against most of what the guild (I thought) stood for which was to help people enjoy this game more.  I remember when I was about to quit playing at level 8 and then emanie came by and helped me cross from Qeynos to Freeport.  This kept my interest up in the game and I am still playing it.  So if helping others out is not the way of the Benevolent Order then maybe the name should be changed to the (Only High level/EQ burnouts order.<br>
<br>
Sorry I got so personal but I am tired of level caps and bias towards new players who want to have a good time and need some help. &quot;Benevolent&quot;<br>

I just started playing again after my extended hiatus as Kavin and the guild has changed almost completely. The real fun of the guild was the fact that we were ALL low levels, we need eachother. We were forced to group just to accomplish even the simple tasks and that was the great part about it. I remember the beginnings too. Heck, I was one of the first members when Emanie and ole Stump came by to induct me into a wonderful, social guild. I do not know what has happened in the past few months but I can see that instead of the usual ten members on at a time, we have dwindled to more like four. I do not think the restrictions should be set so high. What is wrong with low levels anyway? I think ten is a perfectly acceptable number. Just enough time to know who that person is and what they have done for Norrath. So, on a final note, I would just like to remind people that we are the Benevolent Order and should hold true to our name. Be kind and generous, not vindictive or self-righteous.<br>

But in fact I do agree with the lvl 10 limit for you see when I first started adventuring I felt like when I was lvl 10 that I had enough of a grasp of EQ to be able to hold my own, I wish others would feel that way also especially now that our numbers have dwindled we need the new blood more than ever to hold what we have. I am not going anywhere though, this is my third guild and it will be my final rest assured. As I have told a couple of ppl before my first guild was Knights of the Realm and it went down hard and I don't want to see this happen to ours. I hope everyone still here is willing to weather the storm because I think we have a great guild and it can rise again like the phoenix and please if anyone needs help or needs anything within reason of course please let me know I am more than willing to help, that is my two cps or less so now I will get off my soap box, thanks Idella and Faadno for waking me up and giving a fresh perspective to what I have been feeling all along.<br>

Now, there is nothing wrong with that, but i was trying to attract a larger crowd so to speak. From what I gather, korlak and myself are the only 2 high level players Left in Benevolent order.Ill think about a change in requirements that would be more fit to this feedback i have recieved.<br>
