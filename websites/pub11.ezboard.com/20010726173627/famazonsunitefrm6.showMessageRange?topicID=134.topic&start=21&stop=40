Alysia believed that if the Amazons did not wish for another to enter the tribe, then they in turn did not want the Nation United. <br>
<br>
Belle's mother was an Amazon. Aly did not wish to turn her away. Though Belle was raised in Rome, she was not a Roman. She did not fight with Livia, nor did she join Rome's legions. . . . Aly had done that in her past. <br>
<br>
Belle's actions had always been for the greater good, and in becomming Alysia's daughter, it was her rite to hold the position of Princess.<br>
<br>
(OOC Note: For those of you who are against this new Character taking the position of Princess, let me tell you why this was done. Belle's MUN and I are good friends IRL, she also RPs Gabrielle, Alysia's sister. However, Gabrielle is Queen of another tribe. I am already 21 years old, I work part time and have three children as well as a husband. I never know when I am going to have to leave RP for IRL things. The only persson I can trust with the well being of AotNL is BelleMUN. She kindly asked me to help her with one of her new characters and their SL. I agreed. I feel she has been treated badly since her arrival into the tribe. Whether it be just in SL or not. I do not believe that questioning her is appropriate. Our former Princess Cora, left because of IRL things as well as SL. I agreed on her leaving. BelleMUN kindly took the position even though she too has a busy IRL. Whether those of you who are against this so much are doing it because of SL or not, please tone it down a bit. We are supposed to be Uniting the Amazons, not going against eachother. BTW, in this I am meaning no harshness against anyone in the tribe. I am merely stating an OOC opinion to let you all know what is going on OOC in this SL.

&quot;Yes, you are right, Athelfi, they play tricks. And I trust my own feelings more over than anything else. This coronation makes me uneasy, and so I shall not trust it fully with my heart until this feeling is proven different. And I leave you to your own instincts as well, for they usually serve us all best. But what I am asking, Athelfi, is that you merely show.. kindness, if only slightly. She is but a child. Only time will tell, and until then it is still our duty to treat her, at least, as a human being. Everyone at least deserves a kind word.&quot;<br>

::With that, she turned away and retreated back into the forest, no longer interested to dwell on this matter. She did not trust the girl. Perhaps she never would, but Dawn was being stubborn as always and it wasn't fair to Belle, not matter what the feeling she gave off.

The horse turned and retreated onto the trail leading back to Orio-Pata.<br>
 <br>
 Maybe she was being stubborn but it was Dawn they were talking about. You could never tell how she would treat anyone, and since her episode with Keecho and Cupid things had come alot easier for her. Keecho was still in her life, but she had allowed someone she thought she could never rely on, to kill Cupid. Now he was dead, and Keecho was just a platonic relationship.<br>
 <br>
 Dawn was once again back to her old ways. If Belle prooved to be what Dawn could respect her attitude would change toward her, and if Belle didn't give her a warm welcome then she didn't deserve the respect. Dawn was an old immortal creature. The predator is always cautious. This assassin had learned that through the years. Belle was being given her chance, Sartha just didn't know it. Her message had been sent from the mind. Not even Alysia knew it. <p>Pyschotic injustice

Belle sighed softly as she saw Dawn ride off... She'd found it difficult to pay attention, even to her own coronation, when there was so much distrust in the crowd... She'd watched Sartha and Dawn argue in the distance, and knew it was Dawn's voice which popped into her head... It was going to be a long road, indeed.<br>

She knew that no one gained Dawn's respect without earning it. Not even Aly had that sorta luck. She knew Dawn was a great asset to the Amazon Nation. Anyone who possed a threat to the sisters, had to deal with Dawn. . . as much as Aly valued her strengths in the tribe, she too felt that Dawn's mistrusting others could indeed be a weakness as well.<br>
<br>
Alysia sighed and watched again as her athelfi left the coronation of her daughter. It had been a long time since Dawn and Aly had been close. They were good friends long ago. But something had changed. Changed them both.<br>
<br>
Wulf.<br>
<br>
<br>
Alysia held back her tears as she thought about her son. Not a day passed by that Aly didn't think of him. But now was not the time for tears, it was Belle's day. And nothing would change that.<br>
<br>
Alysia smiled as she reached into a small bowl of water. She looked at it as some of the drops fall back against her skin. She remembered long ago when it was custom to bathe the new sisters in blood. But that was no longer a need. At least not for this ceremony. She pushed Belle's head forward and let the water pour over her daughter's head.<br>
<br>
&quot;A queen is a chalice. Let us fill you with visions of our history, fragments of a time before we were Amazons,<br>
when cannibals slaughtered our men, and warriors like the great Samsara called on the shaman for a savior from the future, an Atmah . . . the first Cyane.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then reached into a small pouch and pulled out some petals of a daisy, she then set them into Belle's hand and began humming that same little song that Vyiana always did. Vyiana was the Atmah Cyane, in one life at least. Belle should remember and be honored to have her as a sister.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tonight your coronation continues a ritual passed<br>
down to us through the ages. A ritual of music and movement, a celebration of community and joy, for we are a family, united in sisterhood.  We are the creators and our own creations, The words and the music, both singer and song.  Our traditions stretch back to the great Gaea herself, mother of us all, a tradition of dance-- of music-- of sacrifice-- of blood.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then reached over and grabbed a small chalice that held the best Scynthian wine found. Alysia handed it to Belle and smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;This wine symbolizes the blood we used to use. The blood of our sisters that have fallen before us. Drink it as a symbol of your honor and loyalty to your sisters. To yout tribe.&quot;  <br>

&quot;It is finished.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then reached into her pouch and pulled out a small medalion on a leather string. The medallion bore the symbol of a wolf. Which was Scynthia.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are now and forever more, a Scynthian Amazon.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then placed the medallion around Belle's neck and shouted.<br>

Even though she was a long way now from the village she could still hear. That was one thing she enjoyed about her soul. Being part wolf and part tiger things seemed to work out easier. Little did everyone know that those were the things that really controlled her. She wasn't as human as they all wished. But she was Amazon and even if her distrust made her weak that distrust didn't come during war. Therefore it stayed now. No one could change her, although Wulf had a chance. <p>Pyschotic injustice
