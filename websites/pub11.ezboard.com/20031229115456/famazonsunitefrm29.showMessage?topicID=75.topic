The Shamaness quickly pulled up a chair and placed infront of her humble throne. She sat down on the rone and offered the other seat to Shy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please, sit. Much must be told.&quot;<br>

Yakut took in a deep sigh and decided to go with the goods news first...<br>

She smiled thinking of Otere, she finally had her sisters all back. Her smile faded as she went on to the bad news...<br>
