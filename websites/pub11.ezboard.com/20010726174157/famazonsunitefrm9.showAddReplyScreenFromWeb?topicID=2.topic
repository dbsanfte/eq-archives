 and purely mythological. <br>
 However, as in the case of the Greeks themselves, the records of other<br>
 peoples and clues in their own culture give more detail. Record of the<br>
 Amazons lie also with the Ukrainians, the Chinese, the Scythians, Hittites,<br>
 and Indians, to name a few. The Amazon Nation consisted of a federation of<br>
 numerous all women tribes from two groups : women who left their villages<br>
 temporarily for service to their Goddess, and women who preferred an all<br>
 female society. This was not considered harmful or unusual. Amazons and<br>
 priestesses often formed the backbone of medical and teaching personnel in<br>
 communities. A wide variety of scientific knowledge was preserved in the<br>
 context of ritual and systems of divination. Bearing children was the task of<br>
 a warrior, given how physically dangerous it was to mother and child.<br>
 Symbolically, the mother acts as a human gateway between the worlds when<br>
 giving birth, an extremely dangerous occupation demanding careful<br>
 precautions. <br>
 At the time that Amazon tribes began to form, the primary deity was a<br>
 Goddess, usually identified as the Lady of Beasts, the Bird Goddess, or the<br>
 Snake Goddess, categories developed by Dr. Marija Gimbutas. This was<br>
 particularly true of the Amazons, and is reflected in all mythology<br>
 concerning them. Perhaps then, the easiest way to trace the Amazons is to<br>
 begin with their Goddesses, given the origin of their tribes in dedicated<br>
 religious colleges in North Africa and Anatolia approximately 10 000 years<br>
 ago. <br>
 In the Myrine entry of Chapter One, two Goddesses of the Libyan Amazons were<br>
 described: Sipylene of the Moon and Sea, and Athena of the Sun. In fact,<br>
 there was a third Goddess worshipped in the area, by a tribe of Amazons later<br>
 known as the Pallantids. This was Pallas Promachos (Pallas of the Vanguard),<br>
 whose mere shadow appeared in Athens later. The Pallantids eventually became<br>
 hereditary enemies <br>
 of Athens, after the raids which broke the treaties signed after the Attic<br>
 War. <br>
 The first recorded encounters between Greek and Amazon tribes occur in North<br>
 Africa. Few authors make clear that the Libyan Amazons were black, and that<br>
 so too must be Athena, Pallas, and Sipylene. They may have helped inspire<br>
 divine female figures who have black skin in European folklore, apart from<br>
 chthonic Goddesses who are black due to their connection with the soil. The<br>
 other source is ancient India, homeland of the Goddesses Sera 'army' and Uma<br>
 'light' or 'Moon.' Sera seems to have been predominantly a war Goddess, but<br>
 Uma became Goddess of the Moon, war, and wisdom. Uma's name may be the root<br>
 of the term 'Amazon' from Uma-zoon, often translated 'Moon Warriors.' Amastis<br>
 on the Black Sea may also be named for her, suggesting that Amazons there<br>
 were her worshippers. Sera's followers were settled on the Gulf of Amnissus. <br>
 The migration of Indian Amazons occurred early, probably corresponding to the<br>
 invasions that destroyed the Harrapan civilization (approximately 2000 BCE).<br>
 They established early Northern Amazon settlements, and seem to have made<br>
 contact with the Libyan Amazons, whose Gorgon Goddess bears points of<br>
 resemblance to Kali. <br>
 At last to the Greeks, who believed that all Amazons were descendants of Ares<br>
 through Harmonia. Harmonia is a title of Aphrodite, whose warlike aspect was<br>
 more commonly known as Galatea. She comes from the Middle East originally,<br>
 and may be related to Astarte. Paphos was originally an Amazon colony, which<br>
 suggests that Aphrodite's warrior women brought her there. Still other<br>
 Amazons were from Anatolia and Crete, as evidenced by their worship of<br>
 Artemis, Cybele, Rhea, and Gaea. All of these and Aphrodite were worshipped<br>
 as Lady of the Beasts and warrior Goddess. Athena was different. A descendant<br>
 of the Bird Goddess of Neolithic times, that was also her aspect among the<br>
 Gorgons. The golden Sun eagle was originally one of her forms. Marija<br>
 Gimbutas demonstrated that the Bird and Snake Goddesses were always together<br>
 in Neolithic Old Europe6 . Eventually this was expressed as the combination<br>
 of Athena and Hera, whose temples were always placed near each other. In<br>
 Libyan Amazonia, the Snake Goddess was another as<br>
 pect of Athena herself rather than a separate Goddess, although Greek writers<br>
 later interpreted this <br>
 aspect as the Goddess they called Hera. <br>
 The Amazons of Old Europe saw their Bird Goddess replaced wholesale by a<br>
 version of Athena as foreign to their Libyan counterparts as she was to them,<br>
 and their own Snake Goddess rewritten into an enemy. Daughter of Rhea, who<br>
 wielded the silver Moon sickle of Time, Hera wielded the labrys in defense of<br>
 her Amazons, the blows manifesting on earth as bolts of lightning.<br>
 Eventually, she sent her daughter Heraklaea to defend her people, an idea<br>
 that impressed the Dorian Greeks so much they masculinized her and<br>
 substantially rewrote her labours. <br>
 It was this diverse group of people that created a confederation that<br>
 influenced a huge territory that at its <br>
 largest extended from North Africa to the Danube. The Greek tribes that<br>
 eventually encountered them had <br>
 already institutionalized the fear of women, firm in the belief that men were<br>
 defenseless in the face of a women's revolt. Their first engagements with the<br>
 Amazons did nothing to disabuse them of the notion. Between the devastatingly<br>
 effective Amazon cavalry to their skilled use of warcries that froze or<br>
 panicked the Greeks so completely that the men thought themselves bewitched,<br>
 they served as proof of the point. This and the refusal by Amazons to submit<br>
 to male authority led to an obsessive determination to destroy them. Efforts<br>
 at destruction proved to be in vain. When the Amazons were finally pushed out<br>
 of their homelands, they fled back to the Nation's roots in Tunis and<br>
 Morocco, and then moved West and North through southern Spain. The Valkyries<br>
 were a Northern European Amazon tribe. As late as the 18th <br>
 century, Medieval histories recorded that Amazons ruled Ulm until the time of<br>
 Alexander in a reign spanning thousands of years. Later historians believed<br>
 that Amazon customs only persisted until the 18th century, an interesting<br>
 congruence. That this is blatantly untrue can be seen at the all women<br>
 festivals still held annually on Giresun Adesi, formerly called Aretias on<br>
 the Black Sea, the tradition of women only gatherings under the auspices of<br>
 'tea' or 'crafts,' or the banding together of women for common cause. Present<br>
 day movements such as lesbian separatism and women only religious space are<br>
 further reclamations of those customs. <br>
