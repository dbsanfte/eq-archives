&gt;&gt;My dearest friend, the dark one is coming soon, and I have not the strength to face him.  Not yet, not now. Maybe not ever.  Something must be done indeed, but not yet.  I know I have only untill the end of the summers heat to be free and return and before then we will be upon him..  But not now.  My heart couldn't stand it, not today..It simply cannot be done.&lt;&lt;<br>

::her words seemed scrambled and rambly.  She had trouble expressing what she meant.  It was not that she was giving up, most certainly not.  But today was her anniversary.  It would have been fifteen years if not for the centaurs and the man that ruined her life.  And today she was tempted to mourn for everything she lost as one should.  Finally her gaze returned to madmartigan and she chirped a sweet tone, one that induced sleep and made one forget what the spellcaster wanted them to.  When he woke up Shey intended to be there, but as herself, not the bird of her country. Only few knew of Shey's ability. Anya sat up with a sigh, reprimanding herself for forgetting-it feelt awful.  She walked over to sar and sat back on her haunches.::<br>
