She sighed rubbing her head lightly going over the maps once more making sure everything was in order. She had been waiting for word from Eli for the longest time. Something was wrong. She could feel it.<br>
<br>
She she rolled up the final scroll to set aside, a messanger knocked lightly at her door.<br>
<br>
&quot;My Queen?&quot; the young girl spoke. &quot;A scroll was recently dropped off at the gates.&quot;<br>
<br>
Alysia stood taking the scroll from the girl.<br>
&quot;Efharisto Lily.&quot; Alysia spoke to the messanger. <br>
<br>
She unrolled the scroll and read it over. A small gasp was let out as she dropped the scroll racing out of her hut.<br>
<br>
She eventually reached the village center over looking her amazon sisters.<br>
<br>
&quot;My sisters, your Queen calls for your assistance in a battle. Eli of the Elisians traveled to the village of Varsith seeking an alliance between the Saurians and the Scynthians. He has been captured.&quot;<br>
<br>
She tried to hold her ground, but it was obvious that pain was stricken in her eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;We leave now. I ask only the strongest warriors and those that can give true help to our side. Amazons! Move out!&quot; She yelled as she mounted her white mare and rode out the village gates.<br>
<br>
She had already been dressed in her armour. Daggers, crossbow, sais, and of course her sword lined her entire body. She was ready, and she was pissed.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
         With a violent shove, Eli fell face 1st into the cold wet floor of the prison cell.  A dark and disdained hiss came from behind him as the barred doors came to a clanging close.  The musty air filled the devi's nostrils with a sense of doubt.  Stumbling to his feet, his eyes glanced around his surroundings.  He was in a cell alright.  The walls were made of a reddish bricks of dried clay and rock.. the floor was damp with the smell of sewage.  Beside him was a small torn and stained cot  Eli smirked at the thought of where he will be resting.. the slimy floor or the urine stained bed.  He leaned against the wall, rubbing his arms from the slight chill.  They took away his robes, leaving nothing but his worn pantaloons and his sleeveless tunic.  <br>
        He stepped towards the bars of the cell, peering over to the other prisoners.  Within the other cells he could see captured odusians, with patches of fur burnt or torn off from their flesh.  It was a hideous sight to see.  The air was filled with death and misery.  His eyes fell to the floor with such sadness.  For hours he stood there with his forehead against the bars as his mind drifted from thought to thought.  How he wished he was back at the temple with his daughter Vyi and his wife Alysia.  He was overcome with grief as he did not wish to be here... but for the greater good he needed to be.  As he looked upon the slimy floor, a large reptilian foot came down.  Eli quickly looked upwards to become face to face with his captors.<br>
        &quot;Sss... Emperor shall sssee you now...,&quot; the large lizardman croaked as it began to unlock the door.  Eli cautiously stepped back with a nod as one of the reptiles placed his hands in cuffs and chains and yanked him out of the cell.  Eli had a smile on his face, not because he was going to speak with Corpus to end this war... because he was being pulled out of a cell filled with feces.  <br>
        The devi was brought into a large round room, with many animal heads mounted all along the walls.  Among the animal heads were several amazon heads, which made Eli's heart sank.  He was thrown to the floor, before the throne.  His eyes slowly looked around with caution and up towards the throne.  He saw the feet first, lined with razor sharp talons, and then up the muscular legs... he came up to the chest of a heaving beast, until his eyes met with two dark orange snake like eyes, which narrowed to a slither.  There, upon the throne, sat the Emperor of the Saurian nation, Coprus V'Stakk.  He was larger than the other saurian, who were shorter and more slimmer.  Corpus was muscular and taller.  Upon his head laid a crown, unlike Eli has ever seen.  The crown donned horns and a plate &quot;shield&quot;, much like a triceratops head.  Over his chest was a sash of purple and white, with ancient saurian words stitched in threaded mirthril.  The emperor cocked his head to the side like a curious bird and then leaned over slightly towards the human before him.  Upon all fours, Eli stood perfectly still, not wanting to rile up the king of this city.  Corpus rested back against the throne with a deep haunting laugh.<br>
        &quot;Thisss?!  I ask to bring me amazons and you bring me THISSSS?!!&quot; the king roared, causing a few of the Saurian warriors to jump and squawk in fear.  Eli gulped deeply as he sat on his knees with his eyes down in respect.  Corpus tapped his talons along the arm rest of the throne in a displeased manor.<br>
        &quot;I... am Eli, of the Elisians...,&quot;  Eli whispered.<br>
        Corpus snarled and snorted.<br>
        &quot;I've come to offer you a truce with the Amazon nations...&quot;<br>
        Corpus' eyes widen slightly, as his lips curled to a horrible sneer.  &quot;Truce?&quot; He stomped his foot.  &quot;The amazon filth deserve no truce!&quot; The other saurian nodded in agreement.  &quot;We have been hunted down by them for generation after generation...Sssss... The time for peace has ended.. It is now time for war, mammal!&quot;<br>
        &quot;No!&quot;  Eli stood up.  &quot;We can end this now.  No bloodshed.  No more.  I've seen humans walking through your villages when I was brought here.  What makes them so different from the other humans?&quot;<br>
        Corpus snarled in anger at such disrespect, he leaped out of his throne and before Eli.  With a mighty fist he backhanded Eli across the room. <br>
        &quot;Those hu-monssss...,&quot; Corpus snarled &quot;..Live under Saurian Rule.  They understand the pain and suffering the saurian nations have endured over the centuries and for that they assist us as Allies to the cause.  Among them men and women who equally despise the Nation of Beast Women for their selfish pride.  Ssss...&quot;<br>
        Eli stumbled back to his feet, which surprised Corpus as no one has ever got back up to their feet after a blow from him.  <br>
        &quot;Times have changed.  I assure you that if peace is formed between the two nations that you can form colonies that would guaranty prosperity for both the Amazon and Saurian.&quot;<br>
        The reptile eyed the man oddly, with suspicion..  He began to pace around Eli like a shark ready to drag down a helpless seal into the very blackness of the sea.  Eli stood his ground with his chin up.  <br>
        &quot;Colonies?&quot; Corpus hissed.<br>
        Eli nodded.<br>
        &quot;You are a strange hu-mon, Eel-eye.  Are you a shaman?  Ambassador?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Neither.  I'm mearly a man who wishes no harm to the Saurian or Amazons, only peace.  War is never the answer to anything.  Times have changed, and so have ways.  It is time we fight a war without weapons or... claws.&quot;<br>
        Corpus crawled back into his throne and looked over his shoulder towards the High Shaman Priest of the clan.<br>
        &quot;Sssssire, he is mearly a decoy of the amazonsss... Here to distract us from our thoughtsss..,&quot; growled the Shaman.  &quot;I sensse a god behind him that I've never sssense before.  The hu-mon may be up to sssomething....&quot;<br>
        &quot;I promise you that the only thing I'm up to is restoring the balance between the nations as equals, not rivals,&quot; Eli responded.<br>
        &quot;If you are a friend to Saurian, then prove your wordsss,&quot; haggled Corpus.  <br>
        &quot;If I must prove myself, so be it.&quot;<br>
        Corpus bared his sharp teeth in a toothy grin.  He stepped down from his throne and began to approach Eli.  But before he could reach the devi, a saurian bursted into the room with many cuts and bruises along his body.  It panted and squawked like an injured bird as it limped over to Corpus.  Corpus snarled towards the saurian as it began to chirp and hiss in the saurian language.  Corpus' pupils diolated with anger as he listen, and turned his gaze onto Eli and back to the saurian.  The shaman hissed and snapped at the Devi, also hearing of the news.  Eli backed away slowly, as Corpus leaped onto the throne and pulled out a large scimitar from the display.<br>
        &quot;I knew you were a spy!&quot;  roared Corpus as he leaped back down towards Eli.<br>
        &quot;I don't know what you're talking about!  What's going on?!&quot; shouted Eli.<br>
        &quot;You should know, amazon lover...sss!  I knew you were in league with the Amazons!&quot;  Corpus placed the tip of the blade under Eli's chin.  &quot;Did you think the amazons could get away with kidnapping the Ambassador of Varsith?  You were a fool to come here, Eel-eye.  I will enjoy feasting upon your bones tonight!&quot;<br>
        But before Corpus could make word on his promise, there came a bizarre choo from behind the throne.  Corpus quickly turned his head, as did Eli, to see someone step out from behind.  It was a young human girl.  About 17 in age, 5'7&quot; with a lean figure that could rival the Saurian'.  She was dressed almost like an amazon herself, with a tigerstripe top and loincloth (possibly made from Odusian hide).  Upon her hands were thick leather gauntlets with a large raptor like talon on each one.  Her hair was brown and tied back with a leather strap.  Her tan skinned was pained with jagged stripes, much like the Saurian.  Eli could only blink at this girl, as Corpus pulled away from him.  <br>
        &quot;Leave him be,&quot; smiled the girl as she looked down upon Eli from the throne.<br>
        &quot;He is a spy.  He shall die,&quot; hissed Corpus.<br>
        &quot;Please.. Look at him.  He's harmless.  Do you really think the Amazon scum would bring a man to do their work?&quot;<br>
        Corpus looked to the girl and then back at Eli, who wasn't all that impressive in cold-blooded eyes.<br>
        &quot;You have a point...&quot; groaned the Lizard king.<br>
        The girl smiled and jumped down from the throne and before Eli.  Her brown eyes shimmered like the Saurian, but had a hidden warmth behind them.  <br>
        &quot;Let me keep him.&quot;  she spoke back to Corpus as she inspected and sniffed at Eli.<br>
        &quot;But...&quot;  responded Corpus before he was interrupted by the girl.<br>
        &quot;He is harmless.  And besides... If he does pull anything funny... I'll make sure to gut him myself.&quot;<br>
        Eli blinked again as the girl ordered several Saurian guards to take him to her chambers..<br>
        &quot;Take the hu-mon to her chamber,&quot;  hissed a guard, as he grabbed the chains which binded Eli.  &quot;Keena, daughter of Emperor Corpus, will deal with him now...&quot;<br>

Dreams<br>
<br>
After blowing out the last candle within my hut<br>
I will lay down and my eyes will shut<br>
I will be awake listening for awhile<br>
My memories and happenings of the day all compile<br>
<br>
When the darkness enters my holding<br>
The sleep edges closer and my mind's unfolding<br>
As all my memories cease<br>
And into my head enters a beast<br>
<br>
He is a Saurian, proud and strong<br>
In his eyes he's done no wrong<br>
He tortures helpless men and women<br>
His hate and greed send my dreams spinnin<br>
<br>
I stand up beside my athelfi, weapon in hand<br>
We all show up and take a stand<br>
We fight our hardest, we fight with our hearts<br>
And before it has even seemed like it's started <br>
<br>
The war is over and we still stand<br>
We take our athelfi hand in hand<br>
We sing our amazon war songs loudly<br>
We dance and wave our weapons proudly<br>
<br>
We defeat our enemy and still stand strong<br>
For the saurians have done the wrong<br>
We thank Artemis and Hera alike<br>
And shove the Saurian leader's head on a pike<br>

The tiger had gone from it's camouflage back into it's normal white with black spots. It purred as it sensed all the tense moving in the village as it walked through the gates, taking Delilah with her.<br>
<br>
Delilah's sparkling brown eyes watched all the movement in the village as the tiger stopped in the center of the village where the bonfire would usually be. She lifted her hands above her head and stretched before getting off her tiger and patting it affectionately. The tiger purred a rumbling purr as it closed it's eyes and settled down and napped for a while.<br>
<br>
Delilah stretched out her limbs and refitted her weaponry on her. She needed to become more informed on the situation at hand and began to wander around the village, having not been in here in so long. Perhaps she would find an amazon who was very well aware of the situation at hand and could ask her for assistance in anything at all.

She shook her head and headed immediately for the Queen's Hut. Since she couldn't find the queen herself, she needed to see some maps so she walked through the doors of Alysia's Hut.<br>
<br>
Her shimmering brown eyes spotted the desk instantly and walked over to it and turned the map to face it in the right direction which would be in accordance to the village from her angle. She placed a solitary index finger on the map and then removed it and the map began to move according to the wind of the lands and any movements in fields and clearings and even movements in this village and in the Saurian community. The map was large enough so each person could be represented by the most minte dots. This made the map look more like i was covered by ants but it still worked.<br>
<br>
She bent down and inspected the now skittering details of the map. Wow.. the Saurian people were quite a community. She scrunched up her nose as she watched small formations of dots in the Saurian side and the scattering of Amazons. Oh this will not work too well. Del needed to get out there as fast as she could. She rolled up the animated map and shoved it in her belt and took off out of the Queen's Hut and went to the center of the village where her tiger was already ready having sensed Del's urgency. She mounted her tiger and off they went back into the forest heading for war. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Evelyn Saphros</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(8/21/01 10:40:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=178.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> A Miracle?</span><hr size=1> Somehow,a miracle perhaps,the young Evelyn managed to make it to Scynthia upon her quite large dog,Scooby.Yep,she followed some of the other amazons here,it wasnt out of character for her,she often did stupid things in this kind of nature.<br>

&quot;Woah Scooby,Woah.&quot;She pleads with her dog to stop,until he finally does,skidding to a stop so fast,Evelyn looses her grip and flies over Scoobys head,and lands on her stomach,but not before doing a few tumbles.&quot;Owwwch!&quot;She had skid her knee in the fall,and dropped her wooden sword,with a sniffle and a few tears running down her cheeks,she gets to her feet,and looks at Scooby.&quot;Stupid dog!&quot;She sniffles once more,and wripes her eyes,then bends down and picks up her wooden sword.&quot;You didnt hava stop so fast.&quot;Scooby mearly tilts his head,his ears perking slightly.&quot;Come on,we gotsa find the amazons.&quot;And with that she runs around until she spots some amazons dressed in thier war gear,and quickly Evelyn ducks behind a water barrel,and looks at Scooby.&quot;Hide.&quot;She whispers,and Scooby just prances around.Evelyn sighs and watches the amazons as they head off to join the others in battle.<br>

She swallows hard&quot;Everyone looks to serious.&quot;She talks to herself basically,then glances to Scooby.&quot;Okay...now we joins them.&quot;She points to the amazons leaving.Then runs over and climbs back onto Scoobys back.&quot;Follow them,k?k.Go!&quot;And Scooby takes off running after the amazons,following them... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udelilahtragedy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Delilah Tragedy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#993300>(8/22/01 11:00:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=178.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Miracle?</span><hr size=1> Delilah had been given vision by Eyes, a little girl on her dog back in the village... and it looked as if she wanted to join the Amazons. That wasn't such a good idea to her and she knew it, but the girl couldn't also just sit in that village in the case that a Saurian might somehow get into the village and capture her. Her tiger knew what she was about to do and had shot up it's speed immediately. She clicked her tongue twice and the tiger's form and Delilah herself where sucked into a green light that vanished only to reform itself back in the village, Delilah on the tiger sped out of it quickly.<br>
<br>
The green light was like a portal that would only sit for a minute so Delilah needed to do what needed doing and get in there quickly. Her tiger approached the girl and her dog quickly and as they came up to them both, Delilah quickly leaned to the side and down, using both arms to grab the dog and Evelyn and hold them infront of her, muttering at them both, casting a seating charm on them so they wouldn't fall off the horse until she removed it. The tiger had already turned itself around sharply and headed for the green portal and dived into it. The green light vanished from that spot and returned to the clearing in the valley where Del and the tiger had first vanished.<br>
<br>
The green light was now gone and Del still kept hold of the girl, the dog would be fine where it sat. &quot;You will regret that you wanted to watch or participate in this war, my dear. It really isn't something for you to see, but now you get to.&quot; She smiled kindly though she wasn't exactly happy, seeing that there was a war at hand. The tiger slowed it's speed so it would match that of the other horses.<br>
<br>
So there Delilah rode, on her tiger with a girl and a dog infront of her each having somehow enough space not to be squished. When the time came, Del would make sure these two were safe away from the Saurians, but could still watch and not participate. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udelilahtragedy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Delilah Tragedy</A> at: 8/22/01 11:05:43 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Royal Fogstone</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(8/22/01 6:06:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=178.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> *A look from the side of the mountain*</span><hr size=1> *** A large snow drift sits on a large on the side of the mountain  over looking the place where a battle will rage, as silence is every where and suddenly the snow drift moves as Fogstone rises out of the drift.

<br>
Then suddenly,Evelyn and Scooby are swept up onto a tiger!Too startled to scream,shes can only squeek,while Scooby lets out a grunt as he is picked up,then a growl,but he too is too startled to react.<br>
<br>
Evelyns eyes go wide as suddenly they are taken into a green light thing,and she then quickly closes her eyes,and wraps her arms around Scoobys neck,and if you can picture it,Scooby acctually enjoys the ride,like a dog hanging from the window of a [car].<br>
<br>
And as they are transported to wherever it is they are,Evelyn looks up at Del as she speaks.Though Del's words werent quite reassuring,her smile was,and Evelyn relaxes a bit,and though her and Scooby had a 'sitting spell' on them,she continued to cling to Scooby,and still miraculously she had her wooden sword.<br>
<br>
Looking up at Del.&quot;Im a Amazon!I can beat up all the bad guys.&quot;She nods quite a few times,as she looks at Del as if she were in a trance at how strong and brave looking the amazon looked. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessage?topicID=183.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessage?topicID=182.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=178.topic&index=12><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=178.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.threadControl?topicID=178.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=178.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=178.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm28">Amazon Sisters of Cremni<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitefrm30">Amazons of the Sacred Circle<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6>Amazons of the Northern Lands</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
