&quot;Raven, you are my daughter, you belong with me and your sisters here. Your are to rule Tanais River Valley when I am no longer in this life....Her immortality doesn't matter to me nor should it you. Alysia is a goddess, your a goddess. Why can't you see there's more past a person's mortality? Tanna means the world to me. So do you and your sisters. Raven, you are my first born child, when I held you in my arms for the first time, I just sat watching you as tears fell down my face. I was crying because you were my daughter and I loved you and I love you still. I will always love you no matter what darkness may lurk, you'll always be my daughter.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yakut whiped away a few tears from her face. The first time Raven was harsh to her. <p>§-:¦:-§ Yakut §-:¦:-§

Lynn had finally stopped glory from crying and she looked at the flames. She stared so much that she went into a like trance by the flames. That when Raven asked her a question, lynn didnt hear her or respond (sorry!). After Raven had left, Lynn relized Raven had asked her a question. Lynn looked up, &quot;oh no&quot; She said, relizing she ignored her sister. She followed Raven to Yakuts hut, but stopped far behind her, when she saw Raven slam the door and stomp off. Lynns eyes grew widen, wondering what made Raven so angery. She looked down at Glory then back at Yakuts hut. Saw Yakut go after Raven, She saw them talk and got closer to them. She heard them argue. She stood quiet, then intruded, &quot;Whats going on?&quot; Lynn asked, very concerned. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=amazonprincessraven>Amazon Princess Raven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(1/30/02 1:15 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Sisters</span><hr size=1> Raven looked away as her Mother began to speak of her love towards Tanna and her children.<br>

&quot;I know nothing of love, and I never will.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then saw Lynn approach them both. Raven stood and answered her sister.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mother's engaged.&quot;<br>
<br>
She said and looked to Yakut then back to Lynn.<br>
<br>
&quot;And I'll have no part of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
She turned and walked further into the woods. She knew no love other than what her Mother had shown her. She knew pain and darkness. Anger and Hate. Marriage was nothing she knew or wanted. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3F3F3F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugloryoftrv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glory of TRV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(1/30/02 4:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Drool,gurgle and more drool</span><hr size=1> Glory beams looking around at all the things she was seeing,and all the faces.

Raven had so much darkness that Yakut could not deny though she had tried many times. Yakut damned the day Dakor entered TRV. Yakut looked over to Lynn.<br>
