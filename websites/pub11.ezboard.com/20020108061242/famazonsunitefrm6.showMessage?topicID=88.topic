She glanced around sadly as the other amazons began to show up. She then stood and looked to all of them with tears in her eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome sisters. We are here to mourn the loss of Wulf Heracles Loire. He was the amazon prince of this tribe. Born by amazon blood he was truly given to us all by the Atmah Cyane. He left behind his legacy and glory for this tribe. He knew his destiny and accepted it with honor and pride. He was a friend to many from the time of his birth. We will miss him dearly and will keep his memory alive in our hearts.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then sighed and spoke a bit softer.<br>
<br>
&quot;If any of you would like to say a few words before we light the funeral pyre, please come up now and do so.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then stepped down from the stand.<br>

Her face was expressionless as she stepped up to the stand where her mother stood previously, and looked to everyone.  She shed no tears, but her eyes were dull and pained. Breathing deeply, she looked kept her eyes fixed on the others bravely as she spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;My brother was a true amazon.  Dignified and honourable.  Even I myself would think twice before accepting such a fate.&quot; <br>
<br>
She paused a little, thinking, and then laughing softly. <br>
<br>
&quot;He was even more mature than I was.  Always bowing to me and calling me 'LaCa' rather then just 'Cora' or 'Sister'.&quot;<br>
<br>
Trailing off a little, she covered her mouth with her hand, eyes closing tightly to avoid tears.<br>
<br>
&quot;In a way, I think he was a diamond in the rough.  He stood out among my sisters and myself.  I hope that he will be with us always in spirit, and I just ..wish I had ..even the smallest chance to tell him how much I loved him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Covering her face with both hands..she stepped down and stepped over to her mothers side, crying softly, unable to remain calm. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualysiaofscynthia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alysia of Scynthia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#993300>(3/8/01 10:25:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Scynthian Burial Grounds</span><hr size=1> Taking Cora in her arms, *Which was hard for both of the huge pregnant women . . .* she held her daughter and smoothed her hand over Cora's hair trying to smile.<br>

Tossing it up by Wulf's body she turned back to him.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I saved his life when he was born, he saved my life later on. I vowed to train him to be a strong Amazon. Wulf wanted us all to be proud of him. He made me so proud..no matter what, Wulf saved us all, more than one way.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn stood looking toward the body, sighing lightly.<br>
<br>
 &quot;May the Gods shine down upon your spirit. And may you fight again soon.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn shook her head, blonde tendrils fell over her emerald eyes, covering the tears as she made her way back into the group. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=queenalysia>Queen Alysia</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC= http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif  BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen</span><br>  Posts: 193<br> <font color=#993300>(3/12/01 12:17:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ceremony. . . </span><hr size=1> Alysia let Cora go for a moment and walked up in front of her sisters.<br>
<br>
&quot;If no one else has anything left to say, we'll continue with the ceremony.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked over to her shamans who were standing holding large torches ready to let Wulf's spirit go back to the Lands of the Amazons.<br>
<br>
&quot;May he travel in peace and safety. We love you Wulf. My son.&quot;<br>
<br>
The shamans came forth and lit the pillars supporting the boy's wrapped body. It caught flame quickly and Alysia sighed as she walked back to her daughter wrapping her arms around her in comfort.<br>
<br>
A few amazons stepped forward and started to chant slowly and softly. Alysia quickly joined in as well as most of the tribe. In honor of Wulf, they would spread his ashes among the caves where the Wolf pack was originally found.<br>
