<br>
As her concentration was fixed on killing those centaurs that she could see,one centaur managed to sneak up behind her.It was only when a stick snapping was heard behind her that she broke her concentration and turned around.Face to face with a large and ugly centaur who then placed the tip of his sword to her throat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now you die Amazon!&quot;The ugly centaur growled and went to plunge his sword into her throat.<br>
<br>
Just then Hope narrowed her eyes,a growl escaping her throat that sounded demonic.Then the centaur relized he couldnt move his sword any farther and harm Hope.<br>
<br>
Hope took a slow step backwords,her eyes still narrowed.<br>
&quot;You pathetic creature,you just signed your death wish!&quot;<br>
With that the sword in the centaurs hands began to turn towards the centaur,no matter how much he faught it.Then the blade of the sword slowly slid across his throat,causing not only pain,but death.Just as the centaur fell,she turned to look at a crowd of centaurs making there way to a crowd of amazons.<br>
<br>
Hope grinned devilishly,and turned her attention to a tree just a few yards from the centaurs,she narrowed her eyes,and soon the tree began to shake,then finally uproot.Once the tree uprooted she shot a look to the centaurs,and the tree shot through the air and found their mark.The tree collided with the centaurs crushing them all(4 centaurs)and just barely missed the amazons that the centaurs planned to attack.Hope grinned again,and turned her attention back to her destination,the amazon healing hut. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/usycocallie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SycoCallie</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#8A2BE2>(12/11/00 1:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/sycocallie/callie.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Callie's back</span><hr size=1> ::Callisto reappears::<br>

She vaults herself onto the back of one centaur, driving her blade through his head and cracking it like a watermelon, then flips away, landing in front of another and spinning, using the blunt of her sword to take his front legs out from under him, then takes his head off in a wild sweep. She spins, unexpecting of a centaur being so close behind her and her sword is thrown from her grip by his own sword. She growls and narrows her eyes, then pulls a hidden dagger from her boot, ramming it into his chest before he can bring another blow down. She pulls her hand away, leaving the dagger sticking into him, then kicks up, doing a backflip off the dagger and driving it farther into him. She turns one final time, now bare of her weapons and looks around frantically for her sword. She spots it at last, but finds it is too late as a centaur charges her, only a few feet away, sword bared. Sartha freezes, knowing she can't move away in time::<br>
