Looking at herself calmly, Persephone brushes her long dark silk like locks. she stares at her reflection and thinks to herself::<br>

Something is not right...why do I feel as if I cannot feel Hades... ::Ever since they were married, Persephone always felt an unknown bond to her husband. If he felt happy, she would know, if she felt saddened, he would know and come after whoever caused it if it were right. Looking in the mirror, she tries and tries to think until she catches a glimpse of her left ringless hand holding her ivory brush::<br>

::Getting up quickly, she runs to her large walk in closet and grabs the dark, green hooded cloak. Fastening it quickly, she disappears to the Underworld. Arriving in her garden, she look around and spots her ring on top of the bird fountain glistening amid the lush botanica. Running over to it, she grabs it and quickly slips it in her wedding finger. Upon doing so, she's immediately hinted of Hades' weakening state:: Hades?<br>
<br>
::Looking to her side, she sees a dozen souls walking and dragging towards her:: Who are you and how dare you enter this garden! I command you, be gone at once! ::Even though she spoke of authority, fear was noticably laced within her voice. Completely ignoring her words, the souls continue towards her to with their malicious, diabolical leers. <br>
<br>
::Slowy walking backwards, Persephone accidently backs herself into a cold, stone corner. When it came to the souls, she had barely learned to tolerate her fear of them. And today, she was not particularily brave. She opened her mouth and screamed:: Hades! Hades help me please! ::Looking at them in pure horror, she rolls her eyes upwards as she falls to the ground in a faint as the souls enclose around her helpless limp body:: <p>*~* Persephone...Queen of the Underworld.. faithful wife to Hades... princesss goddess of the Spring*~*</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hadesdarkruler>Hades Dark Ruler</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(4/5/03 6:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=302.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.15minutes.cc/modelvault/markvanderloo/big/mark19_f.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Unleashed</span><hr size=1> Even in his weakened state, Hades was still able to feel Persephone's presence.  He knew something was wrong when he felt her pulse race.  Locked within hos throneroom, he calls out vainly, hoping someone would be close enough to hear.  Then like a sering knife plunging through his heart, he felt the fear which had overcome his wife.<br>
<br>
The spell which had been slowly draining his powers had been slowed through his sheer willpower.  But now, he dropped the barriers which had kept the leeching spell at bay, so that he could cast one last spell.<br>
<br>
Tapping into the immortal spark, which is found within each of the deities, Hades cast a spell which enshrouded his unconscious love.  The souls, which had been inching ever closer, were unable to penetrate the shield.  Then in a ebony flash, Persephone was whisked away back up to the surface, safe within her mother's palace.<br>
<br>
Knowing he had managed to save his wife, Hades gave himself up to the spell, and soon feel into a deep coma.  No longer was he able to avert the drain, and the spell, like a living creature, once denied, continued with greater fervor as consuming Hades' lifeforce.<br>
<br>
And all throughout Tartarus, the souls were unleashed.<br>

As soon as she gets there, she literally jumps off the horse not even waiting to be escorted off. Running into the throne room she looks around for her fellow deities:: Someone help! ::Looking at the empty room, she runs into the meeting chamber. Seeing nothing but a few servants cleaning, she yells at them:: Where are the other gods and goddesses? Where is my father?!::The servant nervously shrug:: N-none of them are here dear mistress.. Everyone is gone doing who knows what...<br>
<br>
::Persephone sucks in her breath in frusteration:: Well find them and tell them that the souls of the dead have overrun the Underworld and that Hades, and the dark gods are in need of immediate aide!

Persephone stands in front of a war hero's tapestry saying to herself:: Those servants won't find the other gods in time...Thanatos and Eris need help, and my poor Hades...If only I could.. ::Persephone stops talking while staring blankly at the tapestry:: <br>
<br>
::As fast as she came, Persephone runs back out to the courtyard and quickly mounts the horse. Leaving as quickly as she came, Persephone makes a hard, fast race for Sparta. After a half an hour, she arrives at the remains of a bloody, fierce battle. Persephone recalled Hades and the dark gods speaking of an upcoming battle and the awaited toll of new souls to arrive. While eating her food, she would hear them speak of who would be in Tartarus and whom would go to the Elysian Fields. Looking around at the lifeless bodies, she quickly finds the Spartan leader on the ground, holding his sword tightly to his dying heart. The leader looks up as the goddess with the radiating aura comes to him, gently kneeling while placing his head in her soft lap (sort of like Arwen in the Lord of the Rings flick when she first met Frodo ).<br>
<br>
Shh..Do not speak soldier...for you have fought hard and brave and will have your rightful place in the Elysian Fields..But there is one more battle there you will have to complete.

She ran across the bridge and over to the palace, Outside the door, she was startled by about twenty zombies, they were easilydefeated, but not without lose. <br>

Movement is heard all around Eris and the souls dragging her are quickly pulled away and blasted way from the cloud of protection. <br>
 <br>
Just as soon as the cloud had came, it disappeared. There standing was Hypnos wearing a white cloak, and around him stood other white cloaked figures but there faces where wrapped in white cloth, except for there eyes, which glowed a bright blue. There weapons were silver staffs with a mere round white stone at the top. These were Hypnos's new henchmen, which he created from the essence of the cobalts that he sent back into the enigma of Tartarus. These were the Sleep Templar, Mages of the Subconcious. Hypnos walked over to Eris who was lying on the ground, and extended his hand out, as his Sleep Templar kept back the other souls.* <br>

In the depth of darkness where his mind and soul had been hiding, a shaft of light appeared.  From within, he could hear the call of his beloved, Persephone, willing him to return to her side.<br>
<br>
Like the song of the Sirens, Hades could do nothing but comply.  And so he flew, intangibly, up towards consciousness, up towards his love.  But as he approached consciousness, something dark and heavy prevented his return.  As hard as he tried, pushing against this phantasmal force, Hades could not return.<br>
<br>
On the verge of panic, Hades struggled, like a person fighting for the last breath of air before drowning.  But the invisible power pushed back just as hard, forcing Hades back down.<br>
But Hades wouldn't be denied.  With a last desperate lunge, Hades tore free.  Yet something had gone wrong.  <br>
<br>
After the sudden glare that had erupted from the struggle, Hades looked around.  He could see his Persephone, cradling his head, while gently feeding him ambrosia.  But he also saw his body, lying lifeless and still upon the floor.  He stared at himself, and realized that he had become what his kingdom was based upon.  He had become a bodiless soul, weightless and gossamyr-like, wafting upon some unseen breeze.  Shocked and terrified, he tried to call out, and realized he had no voice.  He then tried to re-enter his body, and realized he was barred from doing so.  <br>
<br>
He had in essence become a wraith, voiceless, and powerless, forced to watch things that unfold around him, incapable of doing anything in return.  Filled with anger and the overwhelming sense of futility, Hades screamed a voiceless, unfulfilled scream.<br>
