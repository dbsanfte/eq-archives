She was slightly confused as to how she had ended up in the city, but was pleased to see it no matter what the circumstances.  She passed by the ancient city once, never going inside it walls, but it had appeared to be a nice place. She was happy to finally be free to poke around.<br>
The gorgeous blonde amazon walked through slowly into the markets, looking carefully at everything surrounding her.<br>

He'd had a healthy breakfast, he was ready to conquer the new day.  He'd spent most of the night with Hera, the Queen of the Gods, in a purely innocent way.  She had reassured him that his return to the lands of the amazons had been a wise decision and she'd also stopped just short of encouraging him to join the ranks of the Trojan army.  <br>
<br>
But as he walked towards the tent housing the commanders of the army, a beautiful blonde amazon caught his eye.

She was used to men doing this sort of thing, but liked the look of this one, he seemed to have something that screamed power, and nothing made Kalasin Ti'Ya-Kuk'Tai more content in the company of someone. The young woman flashed a brilliant smile at him.<br>
&quot;If you would like.&quot; She replied politely, making sure that while she sounded innocent, she did not sound naïve. &quot;But I warn you, though they are not heavy, they can at times be rather… pointy.&quot;<br>
She chuckled briefly and then made eye contact with him, her emerald eyes shone in the light.<br>
&quot;I am Kalasin Ti'Ya-Kuk'Tai.&quot;<br>
The woman offered him a long nimble hand.<br>

But nonetheless, he took her long, nimble hand in his, caressing hers softly as his eyes were captured by hers.  &quot;I will keep your words in mind then.  May I ask where you are headed and may I have the honor of escorting you there?&quot;  He picked up her bags as their eyes made contact and he smiled at her a little embarrassed at the attraction he felt towards this woman.  His brow arching slightly, the bags were not heavy at all.

She had to admit that she liked this man. He was definitely easy to look at, and one of the more polite men that she had met. Most of the men that she met nowadays were interesting in nothing more than ogling at her.<br>
&quot;You know when you get the urge to visit a place for the simple reason that you have not been there before?&quot; her thick accent at times made her speech a little hard to comprehend, but for the most part it was rather clear. &quot;Well, that is the urge that brought me to Troy.&quot;<br>
She looked at him again, always the one to make eye contact when talking to people.<br>
&quot;Themisycra you say? Are you related to any of the amazons there?&quot;<br>
Though her eyes were almost in constant contact with either his own eyes or his form, she continued to successfully weave through any obstacles in her path without looking to the ground. Judging by the way in which he carried her things, he did not find them heavy at all. She made a mental note that he was a strong man, much stronger than herself.<br>
&quot;Where is a good place to head if you do not mind my asking?&quot; she paused and grimaced. &quot;I speak too much don't I?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theseusofthemiscrya>Theseus of Themiscrya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#993300>(6/1/03 10:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm65.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Blind Leading the Blind</span><hr size=1> Theseus listened to her as she spoke.  She was talkative and that was a good thing.  It meant she wasn't afraid of saying too much.  He smiled at her as he glanced at her sideways.  &quot;You speak well and the accent, well, it only makes your speech that much more enrapturing to listen to.&quot;  He led her through the street, weaving through some of the street vendors and their patrons as they went.  &quot;I am staying at the tavern just near the middle of the city until I can afford to get my own place.  You are more than welcome to stay there with me or if that makes you  uncomfortable, we could see about getting you a room in the tavern.  That way if you needed anything, perhaps I could help you out.&quot;  For now his trip to enlist in the Trojan army was forgotten.  He was helping the lady and that's really all that matter.  Upon her questioning his relationship with the amazons of Themiscrya, he tensed slightly. He did not want to simply be known as the son of Hippolyte or the son of Gabrielle.  He wanted to be indentified as his own man, yet he did not want to be dishonest with this fair maiden either.  He nodded, &quot;Yes, I was born in the amazon village of Themiscrya.&quot; He glanced at her, he could feel her eyes on him and the almost constant eye contact was only further peaking his interest in this girl. His mother's warnings rang through his mind, and he urged himself to maintain his self control and not make a total ass of himself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=battlingangel>Battling Angel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 94<br> <font color=#993300>(6/1/03 8:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm65.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Just Following Along</span><hr size=1> Kalasin nodded when he spoke, and visibly brightened when he said that she could stay with him for a time. It could quite possibly save her a lot of grief, given that she was extremely good at saying the wrong thing that the wrong time. It was a talent that she had inherited from her mother, along with her looks.<br>
“That sounds wonderful” she said, smiling all the while. “I doubt that someone as decent as you could make me feel uncomfortable.”<br>
It was true, with all that she had gone through in her life, she doubted that him turning out to be the spawn of an evil demonic goat would make her feel slightly uncomfortable. Though, she was rather eager to learn more about him, he seemed like an incredibly interesting individual.<br>
“I am amazed though. People do not often like my accent, apparently it makes me hard to comprehend at times. Though, I think that is just my lousy Greek.” She chuckled. “It’s a hard language to get your tongue around.”<br>
The young woman decided that she would drop the subject of Themisycra, obviously he did not want to talk about it, not that it bothered her in the slightest. There were plenty of other things that she could talk about with him.<br>
“So Theseus, what were you planning on doing today?” Her emerald eyes looked slightly worried, like she feared that she had distracted him from something more important. “I hope that I didn’t distract you from it…”<br>
Kalasin was quite shocked. Normally she would not have cared a thing about anyone. She wondered if the man knew just who he was talking to. She was a highly regarded warrior woman, and a highly ranked amazon. As a former amazon princess, head ambassador of Themisycra, Personal Advisor to the queen of the Shaotmlic amazons and the Head Assassin of the Crimson Valley, she was no stranger to burdens, and tried herself to leave them out of conversation. Much like him, she did not wished to be judged by her titles, and even less by her past deeds.<br>

You needed my help so the gods allowed our paths to cross.  Besides it will be good to have company.&quot;  He meant that in the most platonic way possible even though he'd be lying if he did not admit that she was a beautiful woman.  He trusted that fate had led them together and that fate would not have allowed their paths to cross if there were to be any ill to come of it.  Besides he'd just spent the previous evening with Hera and the Queen of the Gods certainly would not allow him to fall into a trap destined to bring any he cared for harm.<br>
<br>
He opened the tavern door and led her inside.  &quot;Just follow me, my quarters are right up the stairs and down the hallway.&quot;  He led her to the stairs and then up, ignoring the whistles that came as a result of her entrance into the tavern.  He'd found that at this point it was always better to simply ignore the ignorance of others and proceed on his way.  He stopped in front of the door and slid the key into the lock, pushing open the door. He held the door open for her, letting her enter first.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=battlingangel>Battling Angel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 95<br> <font color=#993300>(6/2/03 12:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm65.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.speedis.org/images/214.png WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just Following Along</span><hr size=1> Kalasin raised an eyebrow at the man that whistled at her.

The young amazon looked back briefly and smiled at them.<br>
She nodded her thanks to Theseus and entered the room.  It was a nice enough place, not one that she would want to live in for an extended period of time, but nice none the less. She turned back to Theseus and smiled.<br>
&quot;I call the floor.&quot; She said innocently and stood still for a moment, unsure of what to do.<br>
Had she been in possession of her bag, she would have unpacked it, or done something with it. But seeing as she was standing there with nothing in her arms, she really had nothing to do.<br>
&quot;I must admit, I have never seen the Trojan Army in action. I have heard good things about them though.&quot; She said quickly.

He only hoped that her husband would be a reasonable man should he follow her to Troy.  He released her bags and stepped back slightly to give her room.  <br>
<br>
His mother had warned him countless times about things of this nature.  Should he piss off a jealous husband he was certain to be on his own and he was not looking forward to that experience anytime soon.  &quot;Perhaps I should leave you to your things.  You are probably quite tired after your journey and I should go tend to my business.&quot;  He ran his fingers through his hair nervously.  &quot;Just make yourself at home here.&quot;  He smiled slightly, keeping his eyes off of her.

She closed her eyes for a moment and took a deep breathe. This happened far too often for her liking. She walked over to him and put a hand on his shoulder.<br>
<br>
&quot;Theseus, please, do you truly think that my husband is going to come after you for being a good friend to me?&quot; the young woman sighed, she did not want him to think that he would be in any trouble, he would not. &quot;My Greek is poor. In the tongue I am most fluent in, I would call him my zensha shujin. Husband of the before I think is pretty close to what you would say.&quot;<br>
<br>
She didn't want him to feel uncomfortable around her, the amazon woman got that too much already. Quickly, she turned to the back and emptied it out on the bed. Various nasty looking weapons fell out, along with some clothing. She shrugged, making sure that she still had everything, and then turned back to Theseus.<br>
<br>
&quot;You don't have to worry about him. We are no longer engaged in a formal wedlock. Also, he is a man with a wonderful temper. He couldn't hurt a fly if he tried.&quot;<br>
<br>
That wasn't completely true. She had seen what he could do if someone hurt her at all. But then again, since their meeting when she was only fourteen, eight years ago, that had only happened once. The amazon shifted uncomfortably in her travel dress. As she spoke, she rummaged through the few clothes that she had until she found a white chiton that reached the middle of her thigh. She smiled upon finding it, and without hesitation, pulled her current dress over her head, not ashamed of her nakedness, tossed it onto the bed, took the chiton, and put it on.<br>
The amazon, now comfortable, turned back to Theseus.<br>
<br>
&quot;Seriously, I only speak the truth. I don't want you to treat me any differently because I happen to have a man back in Hyrcania okay? I am not a different person. Just like you are not a different person because you were raised in Themisycra. You know what I mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
Finally, she sat down on the bed, frowning as she did so.<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually, I think I may sleep on the floor.&quot; she smiled sweetly. &quot;This bed is really quite nasty.&quot; When she noticed that he virtually refused to look at her, she sighed again, this time rather sadly. &quot;You can look at me you know. It is not a sin. You think my body is on display by accident?&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=battlingangel>Battling Angel</A> at: 6/2/03 8:27:37 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theseusofthemiscrya>Theseus of Themiscrya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 96<br> <font color=#993300>(6/2/03 9:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm65.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/ixltheseuslxl/myhomepage/theseus1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just who is this girl?</span><hr size=1> Theseus jaw dropped lightly when she changed unashamed in front of him.  It wasn't that he'd never seen a girl semi-nude before, on the contrary, he had, but never one like that.  He swallowed hard and walked as calmly as possible over to the wash basin.  He dipped his hands into the cool water and then splashed his face.  Not even bothering with a towel, the turned to her, &quot;I do not know why your body is on display.  It is not business of mine when you belong to another why you choose to dress as you do or behave as you do.  It is sacred, the vows you took.  I will not go against the laws and the blessings of Hera. There are certain bonds that should never be severed no matter what the temptation.&quot;<br>
<br>
He finally wiped his face of the excess water.  &quot;I am certain that your husband is a good man and a just man.  His trust and faith in you should not be tested.&quot;  He moved to gather a couple of items, trying to ignore the arsenal she had emptied out on the bed.  It was safer not to look at her.  His body betrayed his mind, reacting to her against his will.  He took a deep breath, &quot;I should go take care of my business now.  I will see you sometime after night fall.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=battlingangel>Battling Angel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 103<br> <font color=#993300>(6/2/03 11:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm65.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just who is this girl?</span><hr size=1> Kalasin frowned when she heard the name of the Greek goddess of marriage. Before he went she spoke.<br>
<br>
“You don’t get it do you?” she smiled at his back. “You assume too much. I will have you know that I never took any vow under Hera. I took a blood binding. As to the issue of my body, it is my heart and soul that belong to my lover. As for my loyalty, I never made a pass at you. Believe me, you would know if I did.”<br>
<br>
She was starting to get annoyed now. This man was judging her before he knew a thing about her. If he knew Hiroshi, he would understand everything, he was just proving himself ignorant to the ways of the world, and it saddened her.<br>
<br>
“Think about what I am. I am an amazon warrior with a husband and three children. I fight and kill for a living, and am an assassin by training. I am the head ambassador of Themisycra, the village you were born in. I was born a Roman noblewoman, and was a priestess for a time. You cannot define me, and please, do not try to judge me before you even know me.”<br>
<br>
Done, she sighed, knowing that in the end, she could not win. She would lose someone that would have been a friend to her just because she mentioned that she had a husband.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope the army accepts you. But I will mourn the loss of a friend, someone that decided what they would think of me based purely on my status and my body. It is a shame.&quot;<br>

He had not judged her for it was not his place to judge but only the gods place to judge.  &quot;I have not judged you, forgive me if that is what you thought I had done.  However, regardless, I am in a very unbearable position.  By staying here in this place with you, the appearance of wrong doing is still present.&quot;  He moved to the door, &quot;I will not put Troy or Themiscrya in harms way by pretending that there is not something wrong here.  I am certainly happy for you that you have a husband and children.  I am happy for you that you are an ambassador and an assassin, but that makes my time with you further express the greatest need for caution.&quot;  He frowned at her, &quot;I never said you made a pass at me.  I am not that vain to believe that a woman such as yourself would have need for a boy like me.  And before you jump to any more conclusions and I waste anymore of your time, I believe I will take care of my business.  You may stay here as long as you like.

She could not believe the sheer good nature that this person was showing her. Not many people took her words in the way that he had, and she respected him greatly for it.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know something? Your mother must be incredibly proud to have a son like you.&quot; she smiled, though somewhat sadly. &quot;You certainly have a lot more wisdom than most people that I have met. And even though I have stayed with men before, and never had a trouble, if you truly do think that you will damage a reputation, you can do as you wish.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kalasin was glad that she had met this man. He was a wonderful person, and it restored her faith somewhat in human nature.<br>
<br>
&quot;I still expect you to show me around the city at some stage though&quot; she grinned widely. &quot;Now go, join the Trojan Army, they'll be glad to have someone like you in their ranks.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theseusofthemiscrya>Theseus of Themiscrya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 98<br> <font color=#993300>(6/3/03 6:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm65.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/ixltheseuslxl/myhomepage/theseus1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just who is this girl?</span><hr size=1> Theseus shrugged lightly, &quot;I do not know how my mother feels about having a son like me; however, I believe like every good amazon, she would have preferred a daughter, one to follow in her footsteps and learn the amazon way.  But for some reason, Hera chose for her to have a son.&quot;  He opened the door to his room, thinking for a moment before he spoke again.  <br>
<br>
He cleared his throat and nodded towards the pack hanging on the wall.  &quot;There is some food in that pack.  Some cured meats and cheese.  A loaf of bread and even a loaf of nutbread.&quot;  He smiled slightly.  &quot;Please help yourself to the food.  I can get more, it's not a problem.&quot;  With that he pulled the door shut behind him giving her some privacy and time alone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=battlingangel>Battling Angel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 106<br> <font color=#993300>(6/3/03 9:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm65.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.speedis.org/images/214.png WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just who is this girl?</span><hr size=1> Kalasin frowned at the choice of foods that he had listed off. She was not hungry, then again, she rarely was. The amazon woman only ate when she had to.<br>
Right now, she felt like sleeping. According to her body, she had been travelling for nearly 4 days without a rest. It was high time that she actually got some. Without a sound, the amazon woman pulled the rought blanket off the bed and around her shoulder. She laid down on the floor at the foot of the bed, curled up, and dozed off for a while.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left
