Artemis is the goddess of wild Nature, a virgin huntress for the other deities. She is goddess of the moon, as her brother Apollo is god of the sun. She has a triple aspect associated with the sky as Selene, the moon goddess, Artemis on earth, and Hecate in the lower world. This triple aspect is also associated with youth maturity and death. She is often represented as a lithe young woman with a bow and arrow. Her femaleness is associated with youth and birth. The bow and arrow, with which she shoots her victims, represents death, often caused by sickness. <br>
<br>
She is the daughter of Leto and Zeus. She is the virgin huntress, the goddess of things wild. She is also the protector of maidenhood and pregnancy in women. She is depicted with a sliver of moon in her hair and bow and arrows in her hand. <br>
<br>
The Homeric and later conception of Artemis is that she is the daughter of Zeus and Leto and the twin-sister and counterpart of Apollo. Artemis was born the day before Apollo on the 6th of the month. Tradition assigns them different birthplaces, Apollo in Delos and Artemis in Ortygia. Artemis is the protectress of chastity and the young men and women who defy Aphrodite. Like her brother, she not only deals out death, but she is also a healing and purifying divinity. <br>
<br>
Artemis is not one of the major players of the Illiad, but she does play her part. Along with her brother Apollo, she supports the side of the Trojans. In the Illiad, Book XXI, Apollo decides not to battle Poseidon over the Trojans. "But now he had to listen to the biting comments of his Sister Artemis, Mistress of Beasts and Lady of the Wilds, who did not mince her words to him." Later Hera tells her "'Are you proposing to stand up to me? I know your bow and arrows, and what a lioness you are to women, whom Zeus allows you to destroy at your own discretion; but if you match yourself with me you will regret it. You would find it better sport to slaughter wild deer in the mountains than to fight with your superiors." Hera then preceeds to beat Artemis with her bow and arrow. "Meanwhile the Maid herself had reached Olympus and gone to the Bronze Palace of Zeus, where she sat down on her father's lap and sobbed, with her divine robe quivering on her bosom." <br>
<br>
She was the patroness of wild animals. <br>

Of all the deities Artemis has the most comples nature. She could be paradoxically compassionate and vengeful, or nuturing and destructive, or even pacific and bloody. <br>
<br>
Here are revealing quotes from the Illiad: <br>
<br>
"The Curetes and the Aetolians were fighting and killing one another round Calydon- the Aetolians defending the city and the Curetes trying to destroy it. For Artemis of the golden throne was angry and did them hurt because Oeneus had not offered her his harvest first-fruits. The other gods had all been feasted with hecatombs, but to the daughter of great Zeus alone he had made no sacrifice. He had forgotten her, or somehow or other it had escaped him, and this was a grievous sin. Thereon the archer goddess in her displeasure sent a prodigious creature against him- a savage wild boar with great white tusks that did much harm to his orchard lands, uprooting apple-trees in full bloom and throwing them to the ground." (Book IX) <br>
<br>
(Book XXI) "But his sister the huntress Artemis, patroness of wild beasts, was very angry with him and said, "So you would fly, Far-Darter, and hand victory over to Poseidon with a cheap vaunt to boot. Baby, why keep your bow thus idle? Never let me again hear you bragging in my father's house, as you have often done in the presence of the immortals, that you would stand up and fight with Poseidon." <br>
<br>
(Book XXIII) "...and Artemis slew the daughters, because Niobe had vaunted herself against Leto; she said Leto had borne two children only, whereas she had herself borne many- whereon the two killed the many. Nine days did they lie weltering, and there was none to bury them, for the son of Saturn turned the people into stone; but on the tenth day the gods in heaven themselves buried them, and Niobe then took food, being worn out with weeping." <br>

The Arcadian and Athenian rites and legends suggest that before Homer, Artemis was a nature goddess. In her earlier form she roamed the wilds rather than chased wild animals. <br>
<br>
Artemis was born by 25,000 BCE to the north of Greece, but her cult did not come to Greece until about 1500 BCE. Around 125 AD her cult died in Greece and she was no longer worshipped there. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Symbols of Artemis<br>
A number of wild animals are sacred to her: hind, bear, boar, goat, zebu, and lion. She is often shown with bow and arrow, mural crown, and a torch. In the classical period she is shown with the crescent moon in her hair. <br>
<br>
Robert Graves says that the silver fir is a female tree with leaves closely resembling the yew's, sacred in Greece to Artemis, the Moon-goddess who presided over childbirth, and it is the prime birth-tree of Northern Europe. He also says that cranes were sacred to Artemis. <br>

Artemis was a Virgin Huntress; the Greeks called her the Huntress  of Souls.  She protected the wild places and animals; to her was known the deep places in Nature where one could rest and regain strength.  Violence for itself was abhorrent to her, yet she was swift to deal out punishment to offenders, especially those who threatened or harrassed women. <br>
<br>
<br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
The Amazonian Moon Goddess, she was worshiped at Ephesus, her entire torso covered with nurturing breasts. <br>
Artemis' bow is symbolic of both the crescent Moon as well as of inner self-esteem, of an exquisitely tuned inner tension. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
<br>
Artemis swore an oath of the Gods, swore by the beard of her father: <br>
"I shall always be a virgin and live on summits  of the great Sierras, hunting in the forests: O grant me this" <br>
Her father nodded in approval.   Now Gods and mortals call her by her thrilling name,  the deer-slaying-hunter,  and she is pure of marriage and erotic love. <br>
<br>
The Amazons were especially devoted to the Goddess of hunting, Artemis.   Granted, Amazons did worship Goddesses associated with hunting and war, but many also appeared to have worshipped other Goddesses as well. <br>
