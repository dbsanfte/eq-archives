It was my duty...my duty as a Queen!<br>
But even if I was loyal to my Nation and to the Virgin Goddess,<br>
I wanted to discover the power of love!<br>
How it is to fall in love for a man...<br>
And at hoped that my exploits at Troy would free me of my military service...<br>
Of my pact of Virginity...<br>
<br>
At Troy,I met my destiny,<br>
The exalted Greek hero Achilles...<br>
Hector's murderor!<br>
I loved him since the first regard but my duty was to avenge Hector's death!<br>
I discovered love with my worst enemy...<br>
Enemy of our Trojan allies and of my Aryan Nation...<br>
My heart said me to love him but my duty was to kill him!<br>
And I fought him in dual...<br>
That duality made me suffer,<br>
Until Achilles ended my torment by plunging his swordsblade in my heart...<br>
My bleeding heart,lacerated by a cruel duality!<br>
When he saw my face,he fell in love with me,<br>
But it was too late,the Parques had cutted the thread of my life.<br>
<br>
Love is death...<br>
And death is love!<br>
No death is so sweet...<br>
And so crual at the same time!<br>
Love is a murderor!<br>
Eros is a traitor!<br>
But sweetness at the same time!<br>
Passion that even warrior ardor can't equals!<br>
And that discovery costed me my life...<br>
Achilles...my love...my enemy...<br>
My destiny...<br>
I'll remember you forever!<br>

<br>
<br>
The HUnt or Destinys nature<br>
<br>
Still and calm she waits,<br>
sitting in the underbush.<br>
Silence is her partner and wind is her comrade.<br>
Muscles tensed, teeth clenched, she waits.<br>
The damp grass glistens in the morning sun.<br>
There is silence over the clearing.<br>
The warm wind carries the faint voices of birds.<br>
<br>
Her hand touches the earth. The warmth of the wood soothes her.<br>
<br>
Nature is her destiny.<br>
To accept and to give is her nature.<br>
<br>
The leaves brush her skin lightly.<br>
Dark eyes are fixed on dark trees.<br>
Soft hair flows against tanned skin.<br>
She waits.<br>
<br>
There, in the peace of the silence, a deer,<br>
young in years,<br>
brakes through the underbush.<br>
Muscles tense<br>
but STILL she waits.<br>
<br>
Still fingers close around a wooden root. The bow lifts and its arrow points at the wild creatures heart.<br>
Though,<br>
she waits.<br>
<br>
Eyes and arrow are fixed on the being.<br>
<br>
Long, soft brown legs wander through glittering grass.<br>
Soft lips nuzzle the ground underneath.<br>
Hairy ears move from the left to the right,<br>
taking in every siound.<br>
But there is silence, peace.<br>
There is no danger.<br>
It stalks around the tree-surrounded-spot.<br>
<br>
It is one with it’s mother.<br>
It is one with nature.<br>
It IS peace. <br>
It is calm.<br>
<br>
And she still waits.<br>
<br>
Every muscle is tense.<br>
Strong fingers hold the bow. The arrow tip follows the moves of its prey.<br>
<br>
She is one with her mother.<br>
She is one with nature.<br>
She IS peace.<br>
She is calm.<br>
<br>
Eyelids close over piercing eyes.<br>
She takes in the scent of her surroundings.<br>
Her heart is at total peace.<br>
<br>
Peace with her mother.<br>
Peace with nature.<br>
Breathing the same rhythm with her long, legged sister.<br>
Peace within herself.<br>
Peace with her sister.<br>
<br>
It takes in a deep breath, recognizing its sister.<br>
There is no danger, only peace.<br>
Its heart is at total peace.<br>
<br>
Peace with its mother.<br>
Peace with nature.<br>
Breathing the same rhythm with her hidden sister.<br>
Peace within itself.<br>
Peace with its sister.<br>
<br>
Her tensed muscles calm down, after releasing the arrow. <br>
Dark eyes catch deep brown ones.<br>
There is NO anger, no fear, no regret.<br>
Only peace,<br>
With nature, their mother and themselves.<br>
<br>
A soft THANK YOU is spoken between the two sisters.<br>
They breath in rhyme<br>
Until one breath fades out.<br>
<br>
The huntress stands up and long legs make their way towards the dead body.<br>
Life had left its corpse and had gone back to its roots, back to its mother.<br>
<br>
Dark eyes soften as tanned arms pick up the sister.<br>
A faint smile lays on red lips as the huntree carries away her prey.<br>
<br>
The clearing is left alone. There is no other sound than the faint whisper of birds songs.<br>
There is peace again. Peace is nature.<br>
Nature is the mother. The mother of all.<br>
The mother is at peace with her children.<br>
They have to learn to accept and to give.<br>
THEN, and only then, they will be at peace with themselves.<br>
<br>
And when they reach this level,<br>
They will become one.<br>
<br>
One with their mother.<br>
One with nature.<br>
One with all their sisters.<br>
<br>
And finally they can rest.<br>
They ARE peace.<br>
That’s when they are back to their roots. <br>

(by Queen Hippolyte)<br>
<br>
::::Hippolyte sat before the group of young children, holding in her arms her own youngest child. As the flames from the firelight danced on her face, she began to recall in her own bardic way the rise and fall of Themiscrya so long ago.::::::<br>
<br>
The fires of the night had grown strong<br>
We danced and made song<br>
For tonight we did celebrate<br>
A gift from the Goddess great<br>
<br>
A Daughter to the Queen<br>
A joy to all who had seen<br>
A child shaped from Clay<br>
Amazons would rejoice the day.<br>
<br>
The Queen stood proud<br>
She praised Hera, her chants loud<br>
A Nation with pride<br>
A City would claim it's right.<br>
<br>
Then they came in the shadows<br>
Hooved feet and bows and arrows<br>
Fire flew thru the sky<br>
The dark night began to cry.<br>
<br>
The Queen's guard quickly taken<br>
Amazon's scream and shaken<br>
Took their bows and swords<br>
To defend their home against this horde.<br>
<br>
The child in her arms<br>
The Queen fought long and hard<br>
With Smoke and Flame filling the air<br>
Hippolyte returned to her lair.<br>
<br>
Amazons lay about the steps<br>
As Hippolyte ran her heart did fret<br>
In her hut for she did find<br>
A Centaur held her love in bind.<br>
<br>
The blade met the love's skin<br>
Blood flowed down to meet other kin.<br>
The Queen's scimitar soon made it's mark<br>
Deep within Centaur heart.<br>
<br>
Stepping out of the falling timber<br>
The Queen's eyes found not a member<br>
The Heart of a Nation once proud and strong.<br>
Now looked to all dead and gone.<br>
<br>
She walked out into the night<br>
The child in her arms full of fright<br>
The Queen in the forest quiet<br>
She looked for her sisters with all her might.<br>
<br>
Night and Day she traveled east<br>
For she would not accept defeat<br>
To a village she knew her sister dwelled in<br>
A sister, a queen of the Crimson Stone, Eponin.<br>
<br>
Once found in her sister's embrace<br>
The Queen found some solace<br>
For assembled within this fortrace place<br>
Were Themiscryans meeting again.<br>
<br>
Together again, they talked and bonded<br>
To a future and pride their hearts did long<br>
To reclaim their home and forests to gain<br>
The City of Amazons would rise again.<br>
<br>
These sisters one night did join as one<br>
With the aid of the Crimson Stone<br>
They forced back the villians hooved<br>
Centaurs to their dark mountains moved.<br>
<br>
A desolate village they did not see<br>
To rebuild with heart and glee<br>
For soon it grew both great and strong<br>
Again a village of Bardic song.<br>
<br>
The Queen with child in arm<br>
Watched the City again Strong<br>
Her sisters proud did rejoice<br>
For they had made a choice.<br>
<br>
Never would fall the City of Amazons<br>
Never the Nation to shake<br>
For together they would stand United.<br>
Themiscrya not more to Take.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=daphnikearephiparthenia>Daphnike Arephi Parthenia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#993300>(7/24/01 9:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mrmagoo.fortunecity.com/royo/secret/secret03.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Rise and Fall of Themiscrya</span><hr size=1> Wow, that's a wonderful poem! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=vivianquest>vivian quest</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#993300>(8/15/01 11:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Come and See</span><hr size=1> ::one night while there is much drinking and merry making among the sisters at the tavern in a gathering moved outside around a bonfire to take advantage of the cool night air....one lone voice and the sounds of a lute sound over all other sounds bringing a quiet as they listen to Vivian sing......::<br>
<br>
Come my sister and see the dawn<br>
The image from which our life is drawn.<br>
The light with flowers bloom<br>
And day creatures come from the night gloom.<br>
<br>
Come young friend from you hut and see<br>
the wind come through the &quot;Forest Sea&quot;<br>
to greet us with the Morning's cool touch so soft<br>
for you and me, and the young lovers in the loft.<br>
<br>
Sweep over the world does Gaia's hand<br>
bring sweet life upon the land<br>
Nature's way again this way<br>
we can see it as the trees, they sway.<br>
<br>
Come my sister and see the storm.<br>
The air is cool but the wind is warm.<br>
It's light and thunder are coming now<br>
Come see the life's rain coming down.<br>
<br>
The animals now take to the ground.<br>
In there burrows and hollows they can now be found.<br>
For now to Gaia's music they shall nap in peace,<br>
Until the rain does cease.<br>
<br>
Come my sister and see sun's set.<br>
As day says to night &quot;Hello and well met&quot;.<br>
Then shake hands as each passes by.<br>
Night says hello and day says Good Night.<br>
<br>
Now the moon has come to see,<br>
the slumbering one of the &quot;Forest Sea&quot;.<br>
The night pale eye, give soft white light,<br>
As night birds sing and dreams take flight.<br>
<br>
Now come my sister and bring your drum.<br>
For soon the Dawn it shall come.<br>
Tomorrow we may die before we wake,<br>
so let us enjoy this final day.<br>

Each sound was a call for my homesick soul<br>
A loud drumbeat guiding me home<br>
Calling the Great Mother in a ceremony<br>
Or the warriors for battle<br>
I saw rain falling<br>
Like the tears of the Goddess<br>
Like the blood flowing from my broken heart<br>
Mourning my Sisters slain in battle<br>
Calling the Spirits for us of the living<br>
Fist to heart I pray under the rain<br>
And my fierce cry elevates to the sky as a suppliance:<br>
&quot;Great Mother, please help us!<br>
You who face darkness!<br>
Light confronting the Twilight!<br>
It's not our Twilight dear Mother, not now<br>
Help us to arise and regild our legacy, so our sisters<br>
wouldn't have died in vain<br>
To rebuild our Nation<br>
I promise that our legacy willn't be lost<br>
That I'll transmit it with pride to the next generations<br>
That I'll fight to keep it alive!&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm daughter of the Moon<br>
And darkness can't defeat me!<br>
And the weather calms down<br>
I look at the river<br>
Flowing in a tumultuous cascade, whirling<br>
Seeking to pour itself in the ocean<br>
I come from the halls of Time<br>
Seeking for my lost village<br>
To rebuild my Nation and be a proud Daughter of the Moon<br>
And like the Time<br>
Nothing can stop me in my furious run<br>
Through immortality<br>

This is my bardic work for Quest 4. It is a monologue by Gabrielle to a disillusioned Amazon from a story I wrote called "The Conqueror".  (I mailed it to Queen Hippolyte before I realized where I was supposed to submit it!!)   :)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
         "I have dreamed of seeing Amazonia and meeting the Amazons since I was a little girl. I heard stories about brave and noble women warriors who lived in their own villages and provided for themselves outside of our patriarchal society. These Amazons retained such an elusive quality to my sister and I that we used to fashion them as gods cast down from Olympus because of their strong independence. My greatest fantasy was to be rescued from a horrible warlord by an Amazon on her war horse. She'd bring me to Amazonia and teach me to defend myself. Teach me honor, loyalty, teach me to be fair and just and never take advantage of what I had.<br>
         "I came to the wrong place. You are not the Amazons of legend. How can you call yourself an Amazon Warrior if you lack the ability to forgive a woman who asks your forgiveness? You preach honor and nobility from a body without. You stand on your pedestal and shout out hurtful words to strangers. You're not an Amazon. You're a coward."<br>

Lord of the Sword and the Shield<br>
Both destroyer and protector<br>
Both darkness and light<br>
I don't know which side you are following<br>
I don't know why I'm dear to you<br>
Why do you love me, a simple mortal<br>
As the peaceful Aphrodite<br>
Who was your opposite<br>
You're both near and far to me<br>
There's both light and shadow in you<br>
And I don't know if your sword is the one of justice or destruction<br>
I would like to know you more<br>
And to remove that fright in me<br>
The fright of falling on the dark side again<br>
I'm a warrior and proud of my Nation<br>
But I don't know if wars are good or evil, or both<br>
Are they necessary...<br>
As we can't erase death from ours,Mortals, destiny<br>
Are we born to fight and die?<br>
Life is a combat, and I ever took it as a battle<br>
Maybe I'm nearer of you than I think<br>
I'm an Amazon, a daughter of the Moon<br>
Fair light between shadows, as my mother<br>
But I'm stronger than I look at first view<br>
Daughter of the Maiden of the Silver Bow<br>
<br>
O Ares!Lord of the Sword and Shield<br>
If a warrior path can be the one of Light<br>
Destroy the Forces of Darkness and protect the innocent<br>
Free them from the oppression from dark leaders as the Taliban<br>
And from rapacious birds who're stealing even the essence of ourselves<br>
Help us to be free together!<br>
And may this war send to a lasting peace!<br>
To an era where each man and woman will be equal<br>
Where we could live in community, helping each other<br>
Rather than thinking only of ourselves<br>
Where we'll be free and life in peace together<br>
As one race<br>
The human race<br>
And I dream of a land where my people could live in peace and free<br>
You're both warrior and farmer<br>
Maybe your path is mine<br>
And light in yourself is shining, like wheat in the fields<br>
As you protect life and give birth to you<br>
And I'm sorry to have considerate you as dark for so long<br>
And I drink the paz to our reconciliation<br>
O Ares! My father!<br>
Lord of the Sword and the Shield<br>
Take me and weep me in your warrior dance<br>
As it's my destiny <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamazondelerium.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amazon DeLerium</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon</span><br>  Posts: 170<br> <font color=#993300>(11/19/01 1:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/deleriuml9/images/del2.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Bardic Works</span><hr size=1> I do enjoy reading the posts that every one puts up on this board.

but of what so happened long, long ago..<br>
<br>
It was a bright full moon night, the humid air of the end of summer clung had my cloths clinging to my skin, though my cloths were scarce. What was a child of the forest ready to have to wear except the skins of a few of her kills, knitted messily together covering her vital areas.<br>
<br>
She came upon a structure, a large wooden one, with bright lights burning inside, and the voices of women, happily enjoying the company of each other. Picking on a few of the males who ventured into the wrong territory that night.<br>
<br>
The young girl watched with amazement through an open window, watching carefully the one who seemed to be incharge, the lovely auburn haired women, who didnt tower in hight, but you know she towered in strength and power.<br>
<br>
The young girl made a decision, one that had changed her life for the better. She climbed through the window. For, she didnt know what a door was, she never saw one before. Once inside, she had a better veiw of the women. They wore cloths, somewhat similar to the males she had killed previously, but they showed more skin. The young girl felt very awkward for a moment, there they were looking all tidy and clean, and there she was, her brown hair tosseled with dirt and leaves, a few sticks stuck within the nestlike hair. Dirt and dried blood in patches on her skin from that nights hunt and kill. Time seemed to stop as one by one, they looked to the wild girl. She wanted to leave, to run out quickly, but it was as if she were frozen. Then suddenly, the first one she had noticed, had walked over to her. She told her her name was Hippolyte, and she was the Queen of the Amazons in Themiscrya. <br>
The young girl had no clue as to what she was talking about, and that showed on her face, Hippolyte, then explained to her what an amazon was, and what they stood for. The young girl liked it. But when the Queen asked her her name, she didnt know what to say, for she never had a name, she hardly knew of her mother, she knew he rmother was killed infront of her eyes as she hid, she knew that she in the end, waited until she was older and tore up the ones who killed her mother with her bare hands, and a few of her wolves. She had dinned on a feast that night of her revenge. She had heard a word once, someone calling her delusional...but she couldnt find that word at that moment. The only word that came from her dry lips was the word DeLerium....<br>
From that day, Hippolyte took her under her wing and taught her the way of the Amazons, she taught her fighting, skill, techniques. She was a quick learner of the weapons, especially the Labrys and staff. Hippolyte taught her the education only a Queen could teach a person who knew...sadly...nothing...She even taught her how to use utensils to eat food. DeL was intriged by it all, and soon became like the daughter Hippolyte hadnt had at that time.<br>
In the few short years of Themsicrya, DeL has been issued ranks, awards, and titles, but nothing like the title she holds now, the one most sacred to her, the one she worked hardest for...Princess...<br>
Until her dying day, Themiscrya and the amazons and wolves within, will be her family.<br>
<br>
This is my most fondest Themsicrian memory.. <p>         ~~* DeL *~~

<br>
I rebuilt my life by erecting a Nation<br>
Quitting my river of tears to the shore of the<br>
Thermodon<br>
Where I erected the city of justice, Themiskyra<br>
Artemis gave me the strenght I needed<br>
To don't give up after the tragedies that affected my<br>
life<br>
Phantoms of the past, I remember you<br>
Tanias, I will never forget you<br>
But my place is in the world of the living<br>
Where my Mother Goddess charged me of a mission<br>
Tanias, my son,my love, I'm a broken mother<br>
And I'm seeking a sense to my painful life<br>
I lost you and I lost my homeland<br>
That had been destroyed by the wrath of the Gods<br>
And I fled, escaping me from shadows<br>
Artemis, I don't know where I am<br>
But in your honor, that land is mine<br>
And I'm erecting on it a city, as great as your glory<br>
Where justice will reign<br>
Themiskyra<br>
Justice...I devoted my life to that ideal<br>
Recodifying our Ancient laws, creating a new Code of<br>
Honor<br>
I devoted my life to justice and to my Nation<br>
And to you Great Mother, who gave me the courage to<br>
find a new sense to my life<br>
To accomplish the Quest you gave me<br>
I'm an Amazon, and I claim it with pride<br>
And I'm a mother and not less proud of it<br>
I loved my son, with all motherly love<br>
Ri, I loved my son, I'll ever love him, and I'm not<br>
less an Amazon!<br>
Ri,I'm an Amazon, and I'm not less a mother!<br>
Ri, I had a male child and raised him and I'm not less<br>
Amazon<br>
I've enough of prejudices!<br>
But they no more affect me<br>
Their authors, filled with contempt<br>
Spitted on a broken mother and soiled her son's memory<br>
But I'm ignoring them, as they're in error<br>
Unfortunately, they'll rule the world with their<br>
mistakes<br>
But remember this: Themiskyra will never die!<br>
A world of justice will rise, as people will see the<br>
truth<br>
My people!My Amazons!Never doubt in yourselves!<br>
May your shields defend you from prejudices!<br>
May you'll ever be true to your hearts and values!<br>
If you are,it's the sign that I succeeded my mission<br>

Cybele, Mother of All<br>
I beseech your graces<br>
And I thank you for your gift of life<br>
Oh Great One!<br>
Your works created the world<br>
May enter into my heart<br>
The holy words of your wisdom<br>
The respect of all life<br>
Blessed be!<br>
