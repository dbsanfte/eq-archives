She wouldn't hear another word of her Roman trash. She was getting so very annoying and her death was almost unavoidable. She began to jog lightly, as she saw Wulf struggling in his fight against Wulf. She cringed as she saw what was to become if she didn't stop. <br>
<br>
 A Roman warrior stood over Amazon Wulf with her sword rasied. She was going to strike the minute he was pinned. Dawn ran as fast as she could. Diving at the warrior. <br>
<br>
 The roman warrior only stumbled, as Dawn rolled across the ground onto her back. <br>
<br>
 Just as Dawn went to stand, her throat was met with a dagger, and then another into her spine. Falling onto her knees, she pulled the dagger from her back. It had barely missed her spine. Cringing she fell foreward. Cursing at the woman.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Piece of trash..&quot;<br>
<br>
 But as she cast another glance, she noticed who it was. Sapphira had gotten out of the chains, and followed Dawn. Not as best as she could but enough.<br>
<br>
 The Roman warrior now stood over Dawn as Sapphira spoke.<br>

She glanced to Sira who still lay on the ground, the poison slowly invading and killing. The poison caused great pain in Sartha herself, but she ignored it, the weak immunity she had built against the poison fighting it back. Her eyes switched back to her daughters and she growled. She knew they would not give up::<br>
<br>
&quot;Forgive me, my dear girls.&quot; ::With that, she dodged an attack from Brin, ducking down and throwing a black fist into her stomach. Her fist seemed to glow despite the black aura that now surrounded it, and the magic bit away at her daughter until she passed out. Now Sarin was left, but Sartha was unprepared as the glinting blade of Sarin's sword came down in an arc. Without realizing what she was doing, Sartha had lifted the hand that held the dagger, plunging it into Sarin's chest, through her heart. When she looked up again, she saw the surprise echo in her daughter's eyes, though her face was solemn::<br>
<br>
&quot;Mother...&quot; ::She fell to the ground and lay still and Sartha could only look on and bite back a surge of emotion. On this day, she had cold-bloodedly killed her own daughter. Sartha had killed before and never once cared, but to kill her first born child seemed to rip the final hole where she had once thought there was nothing left to destroy. She fell to her knees and for a long moment just stared at the lifeless body before her, not caring about the war around her:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=romansira>Roman Sira</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#993300>(2/13/01 9:52:36 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> losing something</span><hr size=1> ::Sira watched the death of Sarin, but could not find the strength to cry out.

&quot;Sarin... My... d-dear.. child...&quot; ::And then she closed her eyes, the poison running its course. She wished Brin the best. The golden-haired child could take care of herself, she knew.

<br>
&lt;Wolf&gt; Cringed at the hit and scooted back from Wulf. <br>
<br>
&quot;Please don't hurt me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wulf growled knowing that it was all a show. He had been warned about this. <br>
<br>
&quot;It's time Roman Prince.&quot; Wulf said as he drew a large dagger from his boot and raised it over the Roman.<br>
As soon as Wolf saw the blade he kicked it out of Wulf's hands and then looked at him in the eye as he pinned the amazon boy to the ground. &quot;It's not nice to hurt yourself Wulfie!&quot; He growled.<br>
<br>
He was Sapphira all over, and Wulf would be glad to rid the world of this creature.<br>
<br>
The Roman boy spat in wulf's face and then laughed as he turned Wulf's chin back and made him look behind him at Dawn laying there in a pool of blood.<br>
<br>
&quot;No!&quot; Wulf screamed.<br>
<br>
Then a bright light filled the sky and all of Scynthia was forzen for a mere moment in time. . .  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> The Atmah Cyane</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(2/14/01 1:19:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Beginning of the End. . . </span><hr size=1> As the light rounded the entire lands of Scynthia.

&quot;Wulf my dear. It's time to come home now. You have learned so much from the amazons. They have taught you well. You must fulfill the rest of your destiny.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wulf looked up at the Atmah. &quot;Will my mother be okay? And my sisters?&quot;<br>
<br>
Cyane smiled. &quot;I will do my best to keep them in good spirits, but face it Wulf, you touched many people down there. They are going to miss you alot.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wulf nodded. &quot;May I return again one day?&quot;<br>
<br>
She then smiled. &quot;We all return home eventually Wulf. In fact, you have done a great dead. You have made it possible for two amazons to become happy. You granted Samsara the fulfilment of her destiny, and because of you. I can soon return to my home. Scynthia. I will not let you rest long Wulf. But do as you need and I shall make you a legend in time.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;I'll make you proud Dawn.&quot;<br>
<br>
He pushed himself up. By this time Wolf had already walked off and was watching the portal closely.<br>
<br>
Wulf picked up the dagger that Dawn gave him and flipped up in the air once and landed right behind Wolf.<br>
<br>
The Roman Prince turned and looked Wulf straight in the face. &quot;Do it amazon boy, I dare you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wulf smiled. &quot;Double dare.&quot; He yelled as he plunged the blade into the Roman. <br>
<br>
O.O Wolf's eyes were filled with terror. All Romans turned and saw their Prince dying, by this time and at this sight, they knew that Sapphira was gone as well. Terror struck each and every one of them. And then Wulf looked down as the Roman hit the dirt dead pale.<br>
Wulf touched his chest with a single hand and dropped to his knees hitting the ground. The portal immediatly closed trapping all of the Alt. Romans in Scynthia. Only now that the portal was closed. . . they could be harmed. . . but only by one.<br>
<br>
Wulf turned his eyes back to Dawn and smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll never forget you. . . .I love you Dawn . . &quot;<br>

The mist flowed around them and they began to spin wildly until a bright flash came from both and when the light cleared. . . she stood there. <br>

The Great Samsara.<br>
All amazons fell to their knees in respect of her greatness and Romans shivered in fear.<br>
<br>
She glanced around to all of her amazon sisters bleeding. She then saw young Wulf dead in a pool of blood. And she looked upwards to the romans.<br>

<br>
&quot;You know something funny?&quot; She chuckled as she held one of them up by her neck. &quot;I can hurt you all I want, and it won't hurt any other amazon ever again.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smirked as she drew her dagger slitting the Romans throat letting the blood spill down her hands. Samsara was back and was getting her true revenge.<br>
<br>
Blood had soaked the ground of Scynthia before, but never anything like this. Samsara was truly the amazon in her legends. And she would not let anyone forget that. . . <br>
<br>
A few hours passed and she had gathered up most of the Romans. &quot;Any of them that are left behind shall not want to see the light of day if they do live to see it.&quot; She held all of the Romans in a small cage and then as she opened her hand towards the sky, the portal once again opened.<br>
<br>
She looked at the Romans and growled.<br>
&quot;If you ever come back to this world. . .I'll destroy you, your family friends and the entir Alternate Universe alone.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then threw the large cage into the portal, never to be seen again.<br>
<br>
<br>
Many amazon cheered for joy. The war was over and had been won. Each of them suffered truly, but they had the victory in the ending. . . <br>
<br>
Samsara looked over to the small boy who had sacrificed everything for the sake of these amazons.<br>
<br>
She placed her hand on his cold pale cheek. <br>
<br>
&quot;The Atmah must have trusted you greatly Wulf. You have brought glory to this nation and I thank you on behalf of all amazons. And in return Wulf. . .as a thankful gift to you and this tribe, I will let Alysia come back to rule this tribe once again. I however, will always be inside her and she may call on me at anytime to assist her.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then covered the boy's body with a bearskin and then stood before the amazons. <br>
<br>
&quot;You're Queen is a good one to have ruled you all so well. Always remember this war. For it was a fight against ourselves. And we have won it. Never underestimate yourselfs or those that seem like they don't belong. . .for one boy. . .a child even had gave his life for the amazon nation and brought you all to glory. Remember this always. . . Amazons Unite!&quot;<br>
<br>
With those ast few words, Samsara fell to the ground and a bright light appeared around her body as Alysia took form in her place. Aly then looked around and stood up. She looked down at her son and smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Efharisto my child.&quot; She said. The Atmah Cyane had Alysia under a spell of some sort, protecting her from the pain of loosing Wulf. Alysia was proud of him and loved him greatly. For he saved them all. <br>
<br>
Aly then turned back and saw Dawn dieing there in a pool of blood.<br>
<br>
&quot;Get her into the healing hut now!&quot; She called out.<br>
<br>
Three amazons came placing Dawn gently on a rack of branches and carried her into the healing hut where Alysia then dismissed them and sat down at Dawn's side. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=73.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=73.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessage?topicID=79.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessage?topicID=75.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=73.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.threadControl?topicID=73.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=73.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=73.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm37">The Mythical Odyssey Forum<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitefrm32">The Mythical Odyssey<option value="amazonsunitefrm35">Amazon Nation Alliance<option value="amazonsunitefrm33">Character Descriptions<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm30">Amazons of the Sacred Circle<option value="amazonsunitefrm34">Amazons of Lesvos Island<option value="amazonsunitefrm38">High Mountain Tiger Clan<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm28">Amazon Sisters of Cremni<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm31">Amazon Language<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6>Amazons of the Northern Lands</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
