<br>
Evelyn runs to the inn door,and reaches up grabbing hold of the door handle and while a little weak from lack of food and water,she manages to get the door open.Slowly she eases the door open and pokes her head in.Seeing the place doesnt seem to be too busy,she squeezes herself into the door from the little crack she made,then closes the door.She then turns around,and looks about.<br>
<br>
Feeling she would get into trouble if she came out and said she was lost,which would lead to her having to confess that she ventured out alone,she stayed silent,and walks to the bar,and looks up.However not being able to see past the top of the bar,she cant see anyone behind there,so she climbs up onto a barstool and sits down.Trying to stay unnoticed by anyone who might yell at her or something,she just looks around,trying to be casual,as she waits for someone to leave some ungaurded food,or hey even something to drink.<br>
<br>
(Note:Evelyn is 7 yrs old,so she IS quite young &gt;.&lt; ) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ucora2000.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cora2000</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#939393>(9/3/01 1:21:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lost young Amazon</span><hr size=1> It had been long since Cora had visited Phils bar. Only a few people were scattered in the tavern that day. Yawning and rubbing her back she lazily walked into the dark room automatically walking up the bar. Inwardly she cursed all the horses on this world and especially her own on. <br>
As she reached the bar and couldn't see the bar keeper anywhere she sighed and muttered :&quot;Where are men when you need them.&quot;<br>
Cora turned her head backwards scanning the room for Phil. As she can't make him out anywhere she slowly turned back towards the bar. Her eyes stopped on a little .... child sitting right next to her. <br>
Frowning and wondering what a child of that age is doing here, seemingly allone, Cora walked up to her and chose the seat next to the child to sit down.<br>
Wincing while sitting down, and remembering why she cursed her horse before she sideglances at the child.<br>

Noticing a child in the bar, she glances to the Amazon who appears to be the child's guardian. Then she smiles at the small girl and looks back up at her guardian.<br>

She looks wistfully at the little girl before laying her arms on the counter and placing her head on top of them in an exhausted gesture. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamazondelerium.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amazon DeLerium</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon</span><br>  Posts: 122<br> <font color=#939393>(10/1/01 12:15:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/deleriuml9/images/del2.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lost young Amazon</span><hr size=1> ~ DeL smiles to Varia~ Nah, Im okay, Im just going to escort this dear young one back to her village before the tribe sends out crazy search parties...her mother must be going crazy. ~ looks to Evelyn and winks with a smile then turns back to Varia and extends a hand~ By the way, I am DeLerium, Princess of Themiscrya... <p>         ~~* DeL *~~
