Alcinoe, meaning &quot;Mighty Wisdom&quot;, was one of the Queen's closest advisors.  When Andromache died battling Hercules, Alcinoe stayed to herself outside the Amazon villages, away from all contact with the outside world.<br>
<br>
<br>
Nicodema was never told who her father was:  it was never discussed.  She may never know who he is.  Nico and her mother always lived alone, until Alcinoe's death when Nico was 14.<br>
<br>
<br>
Nico then wandered back to her Amazon sisters, looking for someone who could explain her place in life.  She found Hippolyte and the Sisters of Themsycria.  Alcinoe had trained her daughter well in the ways of her people, and expected Nico would someday be a warrior among her athelfi.  Nico was quickly accepted among her sisters and rose through the ranks to finally become one of Queen Hippolyte's Royal Warriors.  <br>
<br>
<br>
During her first battle against the centaurs Nico learned she doesn't have the stomach for war.  She fought bravely and killed many, but isn't sure she's found her place yet among her athelfi.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well educated in arts and fond of reading, Nico has branched out into sciences, attempting to learn medicine.  But she's not quite a healer or a shaman either.<br>
<br>
<br>
Still searching for her place, as many of us do, the teen is finding life increasingly difficult.  Hindered by her body, which continues growing despite her best efforts to learn it's current dimensions, the girl becomes clumsier everyday.  At 16 years old she's already 5'11&quot; and, much to her dismay, growing rapidly.  She prays that she'll still be 5'11&quot; by her 17th birthday in March (to ask to be shorter would be asking the Gods for too much...).  She tries to stay out of the way, physically, of the village, hoping to make herself blend into the woodwork.<br>
<br>
<br>
She is a faithful follower of Hera, Athena, and Artemis - devoting a good part of each morning to her prayers to them.  She  also observes ritualistic fasts in their honor at appropriate cycles and adorns the altar set in her hut with gifts for each goddess, as well as gifts for Zeus.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Everyone remembers their teenage years:  most of us were/are unfortunate to be the kind of teens that feel awkward, out of place, different from everyone else.  It isn't until later in life that we realize we're not different at all.  It's only later that we begin to celebrate our uniqueness.<br>
<br>
Nico's far from celebrating her differences.<br>
<br>
Imagine being a stranger among your own people:  not because they don't want you, but because you spend your life intimated by the very women you look up to.  Imagine the body of a warrior, the mind of a shaman, and the heart of a bard...but not having any idea who you are or who you will become.  <br>
<br>
If you can imagine that, you can imagine Nicodema Alcinoe.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
