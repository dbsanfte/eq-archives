<br>
Sartha Anne Rose... a name cloaked in mystery and secrets. Only shreds of her past was known to anyone, and the pieces made knowledge held their own secrets. She stood 5'6&quot; with waist-length golden-brown hair and silvery-golden eyes that gleamed with an eternal purpose. She was a proud Amazon, immortal, age unknown. She had been around Themiscrya since close to the beginning, occasionally off on her own adventures when an unwanted past threatened to catch up. She worked mainly alone though her bond with Dawn made them as close as athelfi could get. Sartha would fight alongside her Amazonian Athelfi anytime, but it was only Dawn and a few select people that Sartha truly worked beside. They were the ones she trusted her life with, and they knew who they were.<br>

She isn't a mortal from this world, though she was considered to be a rather powerful one in the place she originated from- one of the reasons she was sent to Greece and Earth. Sartha now denies that power as much as she can without giving it up altogether. Most of the time it merely lays dormant inside her, though at certain moments she will be spurred to summon it. Sartha prefers to be seen as an immortal, but she would never dare be so pompous as to call herself a god when she knows she is not. <br>
<br>
Her place in the Amazons speaks of her way of living. She is loyal and alert toward those she respects and owes her personal well being to. Unfortunately, some friendships have come before the Amazons in Sartha's mind in the past. She travels often, and for long spaces of time. Yet she always returns to her Athelfi, showing just how much she truly depends on them to be her family. They are precious to her as many things never could be. Sartha can be very unfeeling and indifferent, but it is clear just how much the Amazons mean to her. <br>
<br>
She has had two daughters in her lifetime- Sarin and Brin. Sarin was the result of a dead lover, a treasured child that was the only thing remaining to Sar at that time. Before Sartha came to Themiscrya, she lost Sarin in a war between another tribe and a tribe of men. It was after Sarin's death that Sartha came to meet Hippolyte and become an Amazon of Themiscrya. Brin was the daughter she had with her first and only husband- Wolfen. Wolfen left Sartha soon after the birth of Brin, and the child grew quickly due to the basis of Sartha's origin. But Brin grew to hate her mother, and later ran off. Sartha has never seen her since, but believes that her daughter will be fine, as she always was. <br>
<br>
Sartha has lived a long, harsh life of much death and lonliness. Much of her time was and is spent alone, even in Themiscrya and the other tribes. No doubt, she will remain alone. <br>

She is able to teleport and use telekinesis. She is also a very powerful telepath. Sartha's mind can perhaps be considered her most dangerous weapon. She is a master of the sword, and is familiar with a variety of other weapons such as the staff, chobos, bow and arrow, and hand-to-hand combat. She is able to manipulate her own energy in situations when she feels the need such as battle, but tends to avoid using these techniques due to the cost it may have on her body::<br>
<br>
::Though Sartha may seem to have many traits, she rarely uses most of them, believing in using the techniques of mortals unless the situation calls for something more drastic:: <p>~The old days are gone.
