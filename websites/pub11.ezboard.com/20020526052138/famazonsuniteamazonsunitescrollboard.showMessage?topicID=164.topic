Smith suffered head injuries in a fall on February 6 after filming in the Chinese capital. Smith's Auckland agent Robert Bruce said he was not filming at the time. He had been in a critical condition at the Beijing Union Hospital. National Radio quoted Bruce as saying he had received a call from China confirming the death. "I received a call from Kevin's family to say that he passed away in his sleep." The 38-year-old had been in Beijing working on a joint United States-China movie, and was preparing to return to New Zealand. He was then to have headed to a movie "boot camp" to prepare for what many believed would be his big break, a role in a Hollywood blockbuster starring Bruce Willis. Smith was known by the New Zealand public for his brooding good looks, but his vibrant personality also made him a popular favourite on set. He developed a huge fan base in America due to his prominent role as Ares in Xena - Warrior Princess. "He just went peacefully apparently. It's just such a tragic loss, Kevin was just on the brink of really where his career was taking off and it's bad from that point, but for all his friends and fans it's going to be a terrible loss to us all." Smith's family, including his wife and three sons, were with him when he died, Bruce added, and have asked for privacy for the family. <br><br>The Auckland-born Smith starred in many New Zealand stage, television and feature films. His ambition to break into the American movie market were realised when he scored a role in the $165.68 million Willis action film Man of War, due to start filming in Hawaii next month. He had leapt at the chance to go to China because the role allowed him to learn from the stuntman who worked on Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Smith starred in many television, stage and feature films as well as Xena, including Desperate Remedies, Gloss and Ladies' Night. Simon Prast, the producer of the Auckland Theatre Company who worked with Smith on Gloss, says his death is a terrible loss. Prast says while there were many highlights in Smith's career, so much more awaited him. And the New Zealand government is expressing its sorrow at Smith's death. Associate Minister of Arts, Culture and Heritage Judith Tizard says he was known not only for his enormous talent, but also for his intelligence and self-effacing humour. She says she is sure all New Zealanders will join with the government is expressing their sorrow that this exceptionally talented New Zealander has died in his prime. The family would like to thank everyone for the many messages of love and support they have received. <br><br>http://onenews.nzoom.com/news_detail/0,1227,81931-1-7,00.html<br><br>Head injury claims star <br>17 February 2002 <br><br>By KIRSTY WYNN<br>Acting hunk Kevin Smith died yesterday in a Chinese hospital after suffering massive head injuries in a fall 11 days ago. <br><br>A doctor at Beijing Union Hospital said Smith, 38, had been on life support after being admitted on February 6 in a coma.<br><br>He had been unable to move and suffered severe brain damage.<br><br>The doctor - who did not want to be named - said Kevin's only other injury was a broken right hand.<br><br>His cause of death was suspected septic shock.<br><br><br><br>A serious, abnormal condition that occurs when blood flow through the body is insufficient, resulting in low blood pressure.
