He could sense the ley lines that wrapped around the world, conduits of power they are, and they are especially powerful out in the natural wild.<br>
<br>
Hermes skimmed slowly over the placid lake, glancing occasionally at his handsome and youthful appearance.  It felt great sheding his juvenile form and obtaining this more mature and masculine persona.  As he smiled to himself, lost in gentle thoughts, he suddenly became aware that he was once again close to civilization.<br>
<br>
&quot;Curses&quot; Hermes muttered to himself.  &quot;Is there no where I can go to without having to come up against mortals?&quot; <br>
<br>
He looked up, and scanned the horizan with immortal eyes, and realized that he was in a place filled with women.  Not a single male was present.  Searching mentally through his mind, he deduced that he had inadvertently happened upon an Amazon tribe.<br>
<br>
Curiosity nibbled at Hermes, and he decided to postpone his private sojourn, and instead detoured towards the tribe.  Invisible, and ephemeral, Hermes went in search of the Amazons.<br>

<br>
 Quickly Dawn had left her hut, climbed the nearest tree and began following her instinct. Dawn's hand grabbed onto the last tree branch, as she swung onto the next. <br>
<br>
 In a matter of minutes the Amazon had made it to the lake, but she didn't make herself known. The assassin figured if he was a god, he would sense her. Most likely sense her long before she had gotten there. <br>
<br>
 Therefore, she just settled atop the tree branch, observing. <p>Pyschotic injustice

This could very well be his first true adventure.<br>
<br>
Before approaching shore, he had noticed several well camouflaged rafts docked near by.  Hermes decided that that would be a great place to start.  He reached the rafts, and gently removed the covering of leaves and branches.<br>
<br>
These were expertly crafted, Hermes thought, as he ran his fingers over the hull of the craft.  Strong hands were at work here, each carving was done with focus and precision.  Hermes respect for these women increased as he realized that there were many male civilizations whose claim to fame could never reach that of this female tribe.<br>
<br>
Smiling to himself, Hermes began to walk into the forest.<br>

Her golden eyes stayed put upon Hermes.  As she slinked along the forest floor, her muscles were tense.  Even though she was watching Hermes, it was not he who she was hunting.  But, if she was lucky.

He had made the mistake of assuming that he was just entering into another land which contained the run-of-the-mill type of people.  But he had caught himself before committing the error even further.  These are not normal women, but women of exceptional strength and skill.<br>
<br>
The fact that he hadn't seen any of them, and the fact that none had approached him, only strengthened his admiration for these warriors.  He had unwittingly become the prey it seemed.<br>
<br>
Not wanting to antagonize the Amazons, but also not wanting to appear foolish and weak, he realized that he had to keep going.  If he left now, he would be thought of as a coward, and he knew cowardice was not part of the Amazon vocabulary.<br>
<br>
Not knowing who or whom was hunting him, he decided to have a little fun with these warriors.  Wanting the hunt to be fair yet a bit challenging, Hermes nonchalantly walked into and merged with a nearby oak tree.  And down the trail, from ten different trees emerged ten identical Hermes each heading in a random direction.  <br>

 The Assassin followed Hermes, watching him merge, and the identicals emerge. Down from the tree the Amazon dropped, drawing her sword.<br>
<br>
 A loud war cry was let out.. not as a summon of war. But a warning to the other Amazons. <br>
<br>
 The assassin had a anger for the male gods on Olympus.. and this wouldn't be tolerated from her. <br>
<br>
 Playing games in Amazon territory was not wise, but ignorance.<br>

What had meant to be a test of skills had somehow turned awry.  He knew he didn't have much time, because these warriors were protected by their goddess, Artemis.  And he felt Artemis would not think too highly of having someone, even her own kin, trespass against her people.<br>
<br>
Realizing the game had suddenly increased a few notches in stake, he quickly increased his senses.  Having never come across any of these people, he didn't know what they would do or be capable of doing.  As his senses spread out like wavefronts before him, he realized something was strangely amiss.<br>
<br>
Another immortal was in this vicinity.  Someone that had the tang of blood.  Also, the scent wasn't that of a Greek Olympian, but Sumerian?  Interesting.  But why here, and why now?<br>
<br>
Not wanting to be caught in a trap by either predator, Hermes went into action.  All ten Hermes took flight.  Three lept into the foliage above, immediately hidden by the dense foliage.  Two ran back into the trees with which they had appeared.  One melded into the ground below, while the other four faded with the wind.  <br>
<br>
Hermes had wanted to step into a rift and be somewhere else.  He hadn't realized that his playful nature had infuriated the Amazons.  And since it was his fault, it wouldn't be right to go on the offensive first.  Plus he realized he couldn't leave that easily, someone or something was preventing his departure.  Was it his sister, the Sumerian, the Amazons, or some other factor?He realized his sidetrip had suddenly become deadly.<br>

And so he appeared in front of the Amazon.<br>
<br>
::I understand that things hadn't started off correctly.  Let me introduce myself, I am Hermes, messenger of the gods.  I meant no disrepect.<br>
<br>
Bowing slightly, Hermes softly whispered to Dawnithinia::We're not alone.<br>

The scent of all living was heavy and there was nothing that told the huntress that her prey was near.  As the fog grew thick, she knew she was covered from all eyes.  Slowely standing back up, her nose lifted, she began to decide which way to seek what she had come for.  As the fog drifted from the north, Sin picked up an odd scent that made her whiskers tingle.  <br>
The familiar decided to leave the two and move north.  Something was up north that she needed to seek out.  Muscles flexed and the lioness slipped away in the thick air of the forests, bounding thru the trees once away from Dawn and Hermes.  Her excitement growing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Queen</span><br>  Posts: 189<br> <font color=#993300>(7/2/01 8:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=238.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Introductions.. whee fun.</span><hr size=1>  The sword was flipped one last time in the palm of the assassin, and then sheathed at her side.

<br>
 &quot;You got off on the wrong foot coming into these lands without invitation, and without telling anyone. You are never alone in the Amazon Forests.. remember that. And now please leave.. or ask permission from Queen Hippolyte next time.&quot;<br>
<br>
 There was an angry growl, and then Dawn turned, dissappearing into a tree. But not completely..she would remain to watch. <p>Pyschotic injustice
Mommy made me this way
Evil and hungry
I'm just a craving soul
Craving for your blood and death; M'Dear
Don't worry it won't hurt..
Just a dagger or two.. 
Crimson spilling onto my hands..
Running over the flesh to drip from my elbow
Scarring the black leather pants..
Mmmm its yummy
Don't worry I only strike once...
Don't bother to scream... they won't catch me

But before Hermes could do anything else, Hera, Queen of the Gods, suddenly appeared.<br>
<br>
::Not good.  I came here to escape from my duties and worries, and I seem to have met each and everyone head on.<br>
<br>
Not knowing what to do next.  Hermes went with instinct.  Quickly dropping to one knee, in proper respect, Hermes paid tribute to Hera.<br>
<br>
Keeping his head down, knowing that he was not allowed to look up without given the permission to do so.  Hermes replied.<br>
<br>
::Queen Hera, I am but a humble messenger.  My speed is but a crawl in comparison to your grace.  I only hope that I will not disgrace, but to do you honor.<br>

The Queen of the Gods was very surprising. Dawn was very interested in this conversation.<br>
<br>
 Yes, the Amazon was very much immortal. To be exact she was 256 years into her immortality. An Amazon shapeshifter, with the soul of a tiger and wolf. The worst predator you'd want to meet. Of course that was when she let her blood lust get the best of her. No one had seen it, all out...<br>
