But she would get over it. Imagine that, Eris claiming someone a whore...she should talk...Ares little whore is what she was and always will be. But she wasnt going to harp on that subject for the time being.<br>
<br>
~ She began to look around into the forest and spotted all the Amazon guards and warriors keeping guard...she smiled to herself. This is what it meant to be an Amazon, when one tribe was in trouble, the other pulled there strength to help there sisters. To her, the Amazon Nation had seemed weakend with all the squabbling, but she hoped that after this war, everyone would put there petty feelings aside and be the strong sisters they all were.~<br>
<br>
~ Artemis had noticed a change in certain Amazons, changes that were for the better, and she liked that...the Amazons needed to get along, and she would see to it that they would. She knows DeL, with suddenly becomming the second Queen in the SoT, has dreams of greatness for the Amazons. She wants it to be as it were before. Artemis could only hope that it would be as it were.~<br>

~She walked to a tree and leaned against it watching the busy Amazons prepare for the war.~<br>

What i'm looking for are specific fighting actions, along with if you want your character injured in some specific way.  Lets try and be as realistic as possible..

<br>
She trudged through the mud, giving a nod to Ariah, who looked like she'd be taking Evelyn away, very good.<br>
<br>
Delilah caught a glance of the man that didn't seem to want to help the amazons anymore.  There's never much order in war, and when there is, it's not much of a war.<br>
<br>
She brushed back some stray hair that was sticking to her face and neck and headed out of the camp and walked over to the smaller of the two tigers, the larger one was to be used for Ariah and Evelyn.<br>
<br>
She clicked her tongue and the tiger seemed to understand what Delilah wanted and headed into the forest without her.<br>
<br>
Delilah herself was heading up west towards the river that would present a problem. She took to another part of the forest as she walked. She would end up sprinting through mud, darkness and roots soon to get to the river and back faster, and Eyes could not check it for her because he wouldn't be able to fly in this rain. And so there she went.. off into the thick, wet forest. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugoddessartemis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goddess Artemis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 142<br> <font color=#993300>(8/28/01 10:10:32 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/mogoddessartemis/images/triplemoon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Weather</span><hr size=1> ~she brushed past the male knowing full well, he couldnt of gotten any hinds blood...but if he thought he had some, it was his problem, she shrugged not caring and watched Delilah walk off, she wispered a blessing of safe journey to the immortal amazon.
