It as up and sturdy.  The rain had begun to pour, first as a light drizzle but steadily growing.  She ushered Evelyn under the dryness of the tent, pulling Scooby along with her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stay in here with Scooby. I'm going to go prepare food for the amazons.&quot;<br>
<br>
Delilah left the tent to the outside where it rained.  She noticed a shelter put up for a place too cook and a fire set up under it with dry wood collected earlier.<br>
<br>
She nodded to a few of the amazons that had brought back a collection of vegetables and game and took the food-to-be, over to a flat stone to prepare them for the fire.<br>
<br>
After cutting, skinning, gutting and washing the vegetablesand meat, she had them over the fire, roasting there as she sat feeding the flames.<br>
<br>
Quietly she stared at the roaring flames, her shimmering eyes twinkling with reds and browns lik wounds in her eye sockets... The rain was even harder now, it looked as if it wouldn't be ending until late the next day.<br>
<br>
Finally the food was done and she plated it all up. She got to her feet and made her way around the Amazon Camp, handing out portions to the amazons as well as the captured ambassador, her eye twinkling with malice as she glared at him.  She left food in her tent for Evelyn and Scooby the made her way over to Alysia with the last of it for her and sat beside her.<br>
