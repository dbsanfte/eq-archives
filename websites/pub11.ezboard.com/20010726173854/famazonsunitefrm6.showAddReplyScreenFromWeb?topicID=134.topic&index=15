&quot;Cora was raised in Rome. In fact, that is where she lives now. She was a wonderful princess. My daughter Aliya, was born in Rome. She is the Healer of this tribe. I myself lived in Rome and continue to go there to see my grandchildren.&quot;<br>
<br>
She stepped forward holding her head high.<br>
<br>
&quot;And who's to say she won't lead this tribe to Victory? We don't need to be lead Dawn. Our battle is over for now. She is my daughter, and riteful heir in this tribe. She has amazon blood. And has the spirit of a true leader. The Ancients have told me so.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked back to Belle and smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;We are blind to the future, we have two choices. One, to either question everyone and eliminate those we do not know or trust. Or two, we can teach those who do not know, learn from them as sisters do.&quot; <br>
<br>
She then turned to face the tribe.<br>
<br>
&quot;And we may join together as Amazons. As people. Our fight with Rome is over.

Hipp chuckled at Hera's obvious remark. &quot;Yes, mam. I will go now,&quot; she said and then urged her horse down the hillside to the village and the ceremony.<br>
As she reached the others, she slowed her steed to a slow walk and slowely rode up to the stand.  She stopped her mare and gazed up at Belle.  Her brown eyes now roamed the princess initiate, with having a closer look.  Then slowely raised her hands to bring her wrist gauntlets together in a clink of amazon salute.<br>
&quot;Yasoo athelfi.  Welcome this day your athelfi stand before you.  For it is not for you that you become Princess of this tribe.

Belle's mother was an Amazon. Aly did not wish to turn her away. Though Belle was raised in Rome, she was not a Roman. She did not fight with Livia, nor did she join Rome's legions. . . . Aly had done that in her past. <br>
<br>
Belle's actions had always been for the greater good, and in becomming Alysia's daughter, it was her rite to hold the position of Princess.<br>

(OOC Note: For those of you who are against this new Character taking the position of Princess, let me tell you why this was done. Belle's MUN and I are good friends IRL, she also RPs Gabrielle, Alysia's sister. However, Gabrielle is Queen of another tribe. I am already 21 years old, I work part time and have three children as well as a husband. I never know when I am going to have to leave RP for IRL things. The only persson I can trust with the well being of AotNL is BelleMUN. She kindly asked me to help her with one of her new characters and their SL. I agreed. I feel she has been treated badly since her arrival into the tribe. Whether it be just in SL or not. I do not believe that questioning her is appropriate. Our former Princess Cora, left because of IRL things as well as SL. I agreed on her leaving. BelleMUN kindly took the position even though she too has a busy IRL. Whether those of you who are against this so much are doing it because of SL or not, please tone it down a bit. We are supposed to be Uniting the Amazons, not going against eachother. BTW, in this I am meaning no harshness against anyone in the tribe. I am merely stating an OOC opinion to let you all know what is going on OOC in this SL.

&quot;Congratulations, Princess. May you hold the honor of your Athelfi in your heart.&quot;<br>

Her emerald eyes were intent on the whole situation from horse back. Once Sartha returned Dawn spoke, whispering lightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just as she has her reasons, I have mine. I'll trust my instinct more than I'll trust anything else. I know better than anyone, that the ancients like to play games. As does the magickal beings we rely on. I have the utmost respect for the ancients and the Gods, but they do play games. I'll leave my trust where it is. My reasons will stay how they are.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dawn nodded to herself, as she waited Sartha's reply. Satisfied with how she explained herself. <p>Pyschotic injustice

&quot;Yes, you are right, Athelfi, they play tricks. And I trust my own feelings more over than anything else. This coronation makes me uneasy, and so I shall not trust it fully with my heart until this feeling is proven different. And I leave you to your own instincts as well, for they usually serve us all best. But what I am asking, Athelfi, is that you merely show.. kindness, if only slightly. She is but a child. Only time will tell, and until then it is still our duty to treat her, at least, as a human being. Everyone at least deserves a kind word.&quot;<br>
<br>
::Her eyes were locked on the Coronation still. She thought she had said what she could. No, she did not trust this girl fully, but she found that it would turn out better the more kindness that was shown to the girl, no matter the feeling behind the eyes. And so she waited:: <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sartha>Sartha</A> at: 5/26/01 4:39:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Queen</span><br>  Posts: 96<br> <font color=#993300>(5/26/01 4:41:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=134.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=AmazonWarMaskofDeath WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yes mam</span><hr size=1>  Dawn growled almost at a low purr, but it was a growl you could tell it most obviously.

&quot;I am not asking to give her your respect, nor is she receiving mine. I am asking to show the curtesy(sp?) you once showed me when we first met.

 &quot;I'm a stubborn old woman, and I refuse to give her anything. I've gotten this far being as stubborn as I am. I only showed you curtesy because I saw something in you. I see nothing in that vessel down there.&quot;<br>

 Dawn's emeralds looked down to the coronation as if she were pointing.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Until I find out what makes me feel so unearthly towards her, I'll give nothing.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn looked toward the princess and closed her eyes, her voice floated into Belle's head. The words that followed would mark what everyone knew of Dawn.<br>
<br>
 ~Congratulations Princess Belle, you have a long road ahead of you. A long road of trying to gain my respect. Congratulations.~<br>
<br>
 Everyone knew the assassin was the hard one to befriend. But she was a good sister once you did. And the statement wasn't ment to insult the Princess. It was congratulating her and forwarning her of the things to come.<br>

<br>
&quot;Then give her nothing, Dawn, and she where her loyalties will lie as we all will. But I'm telling you this now. If she is not as bad as we both think, the day she proves this to us, if it happens, what will she think of you? A true Amazon can reveal herself against the harshest terms, and those who were against her will not always receive the warmest welcome... I know that it matters little in your heart, as it is in mine, but still... allies are few, great Queens are fewer, and Every last one is precious.&quot;<br>
<br>
::With that, she turned away and retreated back into the forest, no longer interested to dwell on this matter. She did not trust the girl. Perhaps she never would, but Dawn was being stubborn as always and it wasn't fair to Belle, not matter what the feeling she gave off.

The horse turned and retreated onto the trail leading back to Orio-Pata.<br>
 <br>
 Maybe she was being stubborn but it was Dawn they were talking about. You could never tell how she would treat anyone, and since her episode with Keecho and Cupid things had come alot easier for her. Keecho was still in her life, but she had allowed someone she thought she could never rely on, to kill Cupid. Now he was dead, and Keecho was just a platonic relationship.<br>
 <br>
 Dawn was once again back to her old ways. If Belle prooved to be what Dawn could respect her attitude would change toward her, and if Belle didn't give her a warm welcome then she didn't deserve the respect. Dawn was an old immortal creature. The predator is always cautious. This assassin had learned that through the years. Belle was being given her chance, Sartha just didn't know it. Her message had been sent from the mind. Not even Alysia knew it. <p>Pyschotic injustice

Belle sighed softly as she saw Dawn ride off... She'd found it difficult to pay attention, even to her own coronation, when there was so much distrust in the crowd... She'd watched Sartha and Dawn argue in the distance, and knew it was Dawn's voice which popped into her head... It was going to be a long road, indeed.<br>
