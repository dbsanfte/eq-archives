She had cut short her time in the south, in Mewt, visiting the temple of the avenging Goddess of war, Sekhmet.  The annual pilgrimage was not such a joy, but more of a duty for reasons know only to the stoic and withdrawn artisan.  At least it had been warmer in the south, she thought, drawing the black cloak tighter about her body as she finally pulled the black warhorse...her pride and joy...to a stop.  She'd returned early with the distant hope that perhaps her love had returned from her journey also, but the empty homestead echoed the emptiness in her heart.  She had hoped the village which always seemed to be active for some reason or other would bring some comfort from the loneliness that plagued her.<br>

Naturally, she ducked and weaved. As hge was down, she grabbed two handflls of fresh snow and dumped it on Varia, with that cold grimmace that usually sat on her lips. The sociopathic queen noticed the barely visible nod that Lilith gave to her, but disregarded the amazon, she had no time for those with attitudes such as hers. She put a hand out to help Varia up. *<br>
