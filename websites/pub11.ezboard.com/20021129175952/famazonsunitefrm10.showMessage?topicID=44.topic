<br>
The Bard gasped as a tear rolled down her cheek. A Smile claimed the Amazon's face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Xena...you're back!&quot;<br>
<br>
Gabrielle had missed Xena soo much, so much had happened. Xena missed the birth of Gabby's child and the adoption of her older one.<br>

<br>
<br>
She looks at the child in Gabrielles arms,then looks back to Gabrielle. &quot;Have I been gone that long?&quot; Quirks a questioning brow. Not acctually expecting a yes or no answer,figures Gabrielle may be babysitting.<br>

Gabrielle made her way over to Zoe's crib and laid down the sleeping child. The Lykastian Queen looked over at Xena.<br>
<br>
&quot;Take a seat on the sofa, it's got good comfort. I've had to sleep on it a few times...You want something to drink? The kitchen's plenty full of food and drink.&quot;<br>

<br>
She strode across the room,to the sofa,her heavy black boots,which were sure to make a sound,but they did not. Xena's steps were quiet and careful,making sure not to wake the sleeping child.  Sitting down,she crosses one leg over the other and arms crossing over her chest.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm good...&quot; She refuses the food or drink,and glances to Gabrielle.<br>

The Lykastian Queen made her way to the sofa and sat down. She took in a deep breath and exhaled it all slowly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, A few weeks after you left, I was in Greece, buying wyne for the Lykastia Tavern. I had bought the wynes and was traveling back towards Amazon Territory. I was just going along minding my own business when I hear this noise...sounded much like a child whimpering. So I checked it out...I found this 13 year old orphan girl named Acacia. I took her with to Lykastia and we got to know each other and I adopted her...I coronated her as Amazon Princess and have been training her ever since.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, Gabrielle had adopted but that's only half of the story now.<br>
<br>
&quot;About a month ago, Acacia goes out on some quest and comes back in a 20 year old form. Which she says she became an Immortal because she wanted to rule Lykastia after me, until an heir of my true blood would come into order...Just 3 days ago I found out she has been secretly dating a guy named Suvi from Egypt. She married him and is preganant.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gabrielle rolled her eyes, Acacia was a handful to worry about. Gabby was kinda hesitant to go on but....<br>
<br>
&quot;During the time Acacia was on her quest, I became blessed by a Goddess of Peace to have a child. The child was to be an Amazon Goddess. Well, the child grew inside me quickly and I gave birth in the Lykastia Tavern, Queen Velaska of Lesvos Island delivered my child. I named my daughter Zoe.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gabbby shifted in her seat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yakut used her shaman powers to give Zoe a realm to be Goddess over. So, over there in that crib lies Zoe, Amazon Goddess of Prophecy and Amazon Princess of Lykastia...&quot;<br>
<br>
Gabrielle was actually scared of what Xena's re-actions would be... <p>§Gabrielle§<BR>

She slightly adjusts herself,sitting more straight. She uncrosses her arms &amp; legs,then stands up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok....&quot;<br>
<br>
Begins to pace,but casually acts as though she is just looking at a few items around the room before looking back to Gabrielle.<br>
<br>
&quot;...So you got two kids....one adopted,and one...a blessing? A goddess and an Immortal? How well do you know this....Acacia?&quot; <br>
<br>
Already has a distrust for Acacia,just from the little she's been told. Course thats the warrior princess for ya.<br>

Glances toward Zoes crib before looking back to Gabrielle.<br>
<br>
&quot;I knew Yakut had power,but didn't know she had that much....&quot; Thinks for a moment,then sighs.<br>
<br>
Knows motherhood is a good thing for Gab,so Xena will be happy for her,just doesnt want to see Gabrielle go through anything simular to what she went through  with Hope.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm happy for you Gabrielle. And have I mentioned,it's good to see you?&quot; Smiles slightly,then walks over to the couch and leans down to give Gab a hug.<br>

<br>
&quot;I know Acacia well enough to know that she will be an important asset to me and of course the Amazons. Xena, she was willing to sacrifice her life and Amazon title for my honor...I'm sure you can trust her. Just wait til you meet her.&quot;<br>
<br>
As Xena spoke of Yakut, Gabrielle gave a light smirk.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yakut's power is strong. She and Alysia are the most powerful shamanesses the Nation has. I have the benefit of knowing both of them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Lykastian, a young adult bear paded through the Living Area and into the kitchen.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, yeah I almost forgot. Artemis blessed the tribe with a totem animal which protects the lands and me..sorta. Anyway, she gave me a bear which is the leader of them of all. I named him Lykastian. Bears roam freely through out the Lands.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Bard returned the embrace with a tight hug of her own. She pulled back and stood up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh Xena, I have missed you so much. Many times I cried myself to sleep at night..wondering if you were ever coming back...&quot;<br>
<br>
Gabrielle was hit hard by her soulmate leaving and only leaving a note saying 'Gone on a long trip. -Xena'. <p>§Gabrielle§<BR>

Xena's attention went to the bear that strode to the kitchen. She raises a brow before looking back to Gabrielle. <br>
<br>
&quot;Thats quite a large house pet.&quot;<br>
<br>
After the embrace,Xena once again began to pace.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry I left for so long without an explaination...&quot;<br>
<br>
She stood still,and leaned her back up against a wall,looking at Gabrielle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Before I left,I had recieved a letter of importance and emergency from the ambassador of Chin. ...To make a long story short,a large army was trying to over throw the government and they wanted me to come lend a helping hand.&quot;<br>
<br>
Walks over and sits down on the sofa.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hadn't expected the war to last as long as it had. The warlord had an unbeleivable army. There was a time I didn't think I would return,but it was all you Gabrielle,I stayed strong because of you.&quot;<br>

As Xena sat down, Gabby scouted over beside her and embraced her into another hug. It was so good to feel Xena's touch again. As one of those tears rolled down her face, Gabby sniffled.<br>
<br>
&quot;I missed you so much, but the most important thing now is that you're back. But I don't understand one thing...&quot;<br>
