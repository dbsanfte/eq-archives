But Cronus proved no more benevolent a ruler that his father. The Cyclopes and the Hundred- handed giants- as powerful,arrogent, and resistant to authority as before-had hardly tasted liberty when cronus once again imprisioned all six in tartarus.<br>
<br>
THE NEW GENERATION<br>
<br>
The 12 Titans and Titanesses, however, retained there liberty-and began pairing off and breeding a new generation of Titans. Of teh dozen, at least eight-four brothers and four sisters-married and had children.<br>
<br>
Theia and Hyperion- both associated with the sun- fell in love and married each other. Theia soon gave birth to a son, the Sun actually ( Helius )- and two daughters, Selene <br>
( the moon ) and Eos ( the dawn )<br>
<br>
Phoebe and Coeus - brought together by the moon-conceived two daughters: Leto, the sweetest and most gentle goddess, and Asteria.<br>
<br>
Oceanus and Tethys- the Titans associated with the sea- joined in a most prolific union. Their offspring included all the 3,000 rivers-each with its own ( usually male ) god-and the 3,000 Oceanids<br>
<br>
The most impressive Union of all-that between Cronus and Rhea, the father and mother of the Gods-produced six divine children. All three daughters-Hestia,Demeter, and Hera-and all three sons- Hades, Poseidon and Zeus- would soon take there place as gods on Olympus. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugoddessartemis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goddess Artemis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 157<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(9/4/01 10:42:25 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/mogoddessartemis/images/triplemoon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> A Tale thats hard to swallow</span><hr size=1> As lord of the immortals, Cronus became even more of a tyrant then his own father. His parents, Gaia and Uranus, had warned him when he first seized the heavently throne that despite his great power, he would one day be overthrown by his own son. But Cronus relished his power and would not tolerate any potential challenges to his position as king of the immortals.<br>
<br>
To secure his power, Cronus came up with a desterdly scheme. Recalling that he and his Titanic siblings had escpaed from the darkest depths of Mother Earth only because she became unwilling to bear the burden of keeping them inside her.Cronus decided to assume the burden of his own children himself. With the birth of each of his children-one a year- Cronus scooped up the child just as he or she emerged from Rhea's womb and immediatly swallowed the child whole.<br>
<br>
Rhea, grieving he rlost children, built up a tremendous rage against her husband. When she concevied with her sixth and youngest child, Zeus, Rhea pleaded with her parents to devise some scheme to conceal the birth of this child. Gaia and Uranus, who foretold the future of both father and son, quickly consented to their daughters request.<br>
<br>
Gaia and Uranus quietly sent their daughter to Lyktos in Crete. There, in the dead of night, Rhea gave birth to Zeus and immedialty turned him over to her Mother Earth. Gaia hid her grandchild in a cave on Mount Dicte, and nourished him with both food and love.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Rhea quickly returned to Cronus bearing a large stone wrapped in swaddling cloths. Without taking the trouble to examine this bundle, Cronus swallowed it whole.<br>
<br>
Zeus grew up in Crete in the care of the ash nymph Amaltheia, who nursed him with her own milk. By the time he attained manhood. Zeus had become invincibly strong and swift.<br>
<br>
< In gratitude for her nurturing, Zeus would later transform the nympth Amaltheia into the constilation Capricorn. Zeus also took one of her horns and turned it into the famed " Cornicopia."<br>

Metis advised him to go first to him mother Rhea and to volunteer to serve as Cronus's cupbearer. She then outlined a scheme that would allow Zeus to wreak vengance on his father and release his brothers and sisters.<br>
<br>
When Zeus approached his mother, she eagerly embraced the plan. Rhea prepared an emetic potion that would make her husband vomit. Zeus then mixed the emetic into a honeyed drink and humbly carried it to Cronus.<br>
<br>
As soon as Cronus had taken a long draft of this noxious drink, he began throwing up. First came the stone that Rhea had substituted for her younger child, then Zeus's five brothers and sisters followed. All emerged unharmed. By acclamation, the siblings immediatly chose Zeus to lead them in a war against Cronus and the Titans. <p>Goddess Artemis

After all, i tpitted the nearly invincible Titans against the equally formidable children of Cronus. Every day for 10 years, both sides fought fiercly on the battlefield. The battles went back and forth- with each side stubbornly alternating attacks and retreates. The daily combat had worn down and weakened each group of immortals. Yet, even after 10 years, the outcome was by no means certain.<br>
<br>
Gaia foretold that the children of Cronus would triumph if joined by there allies in Tartarus. She assured Zeus that if the three hundred handed, 50 headed Giants joined the alliance of new Olympians, they would surly win victory and the glory that comes with it.<br>
<br>
Zeus heeded this oracle and headed straight down to Tartarus, the darkest depths of theUnderworld, where teh Hundred-handed Giants and the Cyclopes had been kept imprisioned by both Cronus and his father Uranus. After killing Campe, the jailer, and stealing her keys, Zeus freed all six of his uncles: the Cyclopes and the hundred handed Giants. He immediatly relieved them of both thirst and hunger with offerings of nectar and ambrosia, which revived both their bodies and spirits.<br>
<br>
After leading them up out of Tartarus, Zeus enlisted all six, reminding them who had at last pulled them out of earths depths-and who had put them there in the first place. Briareus, Cottus, and Gyges- the hundred handed giants-quickly pledged their lives to protecting Zeus's power. The Cyclopes also needed  little convincing. Indeed, they showed their gratitude to their rescuers by contriving new weapons and presenting them to the sons of Cronus:<br>
<br>
For Zeus, teh Cyclopes forged thunder and lighting, which would become his weapons of choise.<br>
<br>
For Hades, the Cyclopes profferedthe helmet of darkness, a magical hood that makes its wearer invisible.<br>
<br>
For Poseidon, they forged a trident, which would become emblematic of the future god of the sea.<br>
<br>
After Zeus, Hades and Poseidon held a war couinsel,, the fighting resumed with a new enthusiasm on the younger generation's part. By contrast, the Titans-now lead in battle by Atlas, whom the other Titans had hand-picked to replace their not so invincible former leader, Cronus- seemed weary of the endless battle.<br>

The Hundred-handed Giants attacked the Titans with barrages of massive boulders-hurled in crushing volleys of 300, one from each of their mighty arms. The Titans also added to their ranks. The clash of warriors was so fierce that the sound of their fighting made the earth rumble, the sea swell, and the heavens shake. Even teh depths of Tartarus resounded with the sound of their blows and the landing of thier missles.<br>
<br>
Zeus also showed his mettle in this renewed campaign. The gods steadily advanced upon the Titans, hurling his new thunderbolts in front of him. The Earth itself became scorched with his flames. Vast forests were eradicated and the oceans and rivers steamed with the heat of Zeus's blasts. The Earth-born Titans, overcame by the steam and blinded by the thunderbolts, soon fell to the Olympian gods.<br>
<br>
The gifts offered by the Cyclopes proved invaluable weapons, especially in the attack on Cronus. Hades entered the stronghold of Cronus first, silently slipping inside and making off with his weapons. Poseidon quickly followed and began attacking his father with the trident. Though this assault did not harm Cronus, it distracted him enough to allow Zeus to hurl a thunderbolt at his defenseless father. Cronus finally had to concede victory to his sons.<br>
<br>
Having crushed Cronus and the Titans, the Army of Zeus drove all of thier enemies down to the lowest depths of Tartarus. Zeus decreed that the Titans should remain imprisioned in Tartarus, hidden away far below the earth, forever. Securely locked behind its marble gates and bronze threshold, deeply rooted in the ground, the Titans had no chance of escape. But just incase they did, Briareus, Cottus, and Gyges-three giants with 150 heads amoung them-stood watch outside the walls of Tartarus.<br>
<br>
Only one of the Titans who had opposed Zeus and his siblings avoided eternal imprisionment in Tartarus. For Atlas, who had led his fellow Titans in battle, Zeus reserved a special punishment. The god placed Atlas at the Westmost end of the earth and ordered him to lift up the sky and bear the weight of heaven forever more on his head and shoulders.<br>
<br>
As for his supporters, the new King of the immortals rewarded them handsomly. To Briaieus, Zeus gave his daughter, Cymopoleia. The Titans who did not oppose the Olympians-the six Titanesses, Oceanus, Helius, Prometheus, and Epimetheus-all retained their place of honor and their functions amoung the Olympians. Amoung these, the Olympians showed particular reverence for Themis, Oceanus, and Tethys. By remembering supporters, Zeus helped to ensure that his reign as the lord of the gods-unlike those of his father and grandfather- would last forever. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugoddessartemis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goddess Artemis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 167<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(9/8/01 4:06:28 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/mogoddessartemis/images/triplemoon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Part 5</span><hr size=1> THE REIGN OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING: OLYMPUS UNDER ZEUS<br>

Having disposed of their father, the six children of Rhea and Cronus became the first of the Olympian Gods. Unlike thier predecessors, these Olympians would-despite some challenges-hold onto the power to rule teh universe, governing the affairs of both gods and men for the rest of time.<br>
<br>
At Gaia's urging, the gods of Olympus-supremely grateful to thier brother for freeing them from their father-implored Zeus, teh greatest of the gods, to rule over them. The ambitious Zeus readily accepted this honor.<br>
<br>
But how would they divide the poils of their victory over the Titans? Who would rule the heavens? Who would rule teh sea, the Earth and the Underworld? Zeus decided to cast lots to determine the domination of each god. ( the goddesses were excluded from this divison of power ) The three brothers- Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades-placed there names in a helmet and drew them out to determine the Lord of Sky, Sea and the Underworld.<br>
By chance, Zeus drew the sky, Poseidon drew the sea and Hades drew the Underworld. The brothers agreed that both the Earth and Mt Olympus-the home of the gods-would remain under their jurisdiction, the relm of no one god.<br>

As ruler of the Heavens, Zeus imposed order to the universe. He placed all the planets and the stars in the sky.<br>

He also commanded meteoroligical phenomena. It was he who sent the rains that fertilized the earth and made it productive. He also commanded the thunderstorm,wielding thunder and lightning as his most potent weapons. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugoddessartemis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goddess Artemis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 169<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(9/8/01 4:24:43 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/mogoddessartemis/images/triplemoon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> King of Gods, God of Kings</span><hr size=1> Despite the initial agreement that Olympus would not belong to any one single god. Zeus-as Lord of the Heavens- in effect ruled Olympus as well. But he did not lord over the other gods with an iron fist. Rather then maintaining his power throughout force alone. Zeus held his position through wisdom and justice.<br>
<br>
If not exactly a benevolent ruler, Zeus was, for most part, sensible, shrewed, and fair. In mediating conflicts amoung the gods, for example, Zeus demonstrated both impartially and with good judgement. Many of these arguments involved border disputes-such as when Poseidon and Athena both wanted to serve as patron of Athens. Zeus chose to remain neutral, putting the question before a tribunal of other gods. In a similar dispute between the same two Olympians over Troezen, Zeus ruled that Poseidon and Athena should share that city equally- a solution that satisfied neither of them.<br>
<br>
Zeus often found compromise the quickest route to justice. When Demeter demanded the return of her daughter Persephone from Hades, Zeus ruled that the girl should spend part of the year with her mother and part of it with her new husband. Similarly, when both Persephone and Aphrodite claimed the right to rear Adonis, Zeus found a solution that demanded mutual compromise.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uxgoddessaphrodite.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xGoddess Aphrodite</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 96<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(9/9/01 6:19:48 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.xenafan.com/gallery/official/aphrodite_02.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Adonis</span><hr size=1> The right to rear?....Babe, that boy had the RIGHT rear!<br>

He would have withheld fire from the human race had not prometheus stolen it from Olympus and presented it to man. <br>
Later, Zeus-grossly offended by the mortal Lycaon, who had served the god human flesh to eat-intended to wipe out the entire race with a great flood. Once again however, Prometheus saved teh day.<br>
<br>
Deucalion, a son of Prometheus, married Pyrrha, a daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora. When Promethious learned of the floor Zeus had planned, he warned Deucalion and Pyrrha, who swiftly built a boat and stocked it with food. The flood lasted for nine days and nights, but the couple then landed safely on Mount Parnassus. Zeus showing no mercy, then helped them repopulate the earth by throwing stones. Those that Pryyha threw became women and those that Deucalion threw, became men.<br>
<br>
In the affairs of mortals, the justice of Zeus often involved chastening or punishing mortals for overreaching. Those mortals who dared to assume divine rights, privileges, or powers soon regretted having aroused the wrath of Zeus.<br>

In addition to guarding the rights of the gods, Zeus sometimes protected mortal kings from overreachers. Zeus also harshly punished those who violated the laws of hospitality towards guests and suppliants ( those who humbly asked there host for some favor ). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugoddessartemis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goddess Artemis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 172<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(9/10/01 2:33:24 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/mogoddessartemis/images/triplemoon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Trouble in Paradise</span><hr size=1> As ruler of Olympus by acclamation, Zeus experianced few threats to his power. The gods tried to challenge his rule just once. Hera, Poseidon, and young Apollo-soon joined by all the other Olympians, except Hestia-rose against Zeus.<br>
<br>
As Zeus lay sleeping, they bound him to his couch with htongs of rawhide,tying 100 knots to hold him fast. Though Zeus could scarcly move a muscle, he boldly threatened the rebellious gods with instantanious destruction. They only laughed and mocked him, knowing that his intimidating thunderbolts were far out of reach.<br>
<br>
The debate over who would best succeed Zeus as ruler of the gods grew heated, however. The argument might have led to a civil war amoung the Olympians, but the Nereid Thetis-ancient goddess of the sea-saved the Olympians from war. As the debate raged on, Thetis summoned Briareus, one of the hundred handed Giants. Using all of his hands at once, Briareus swiftly untied teh 100 knots, freeing the god who had freed him from Tartarus.<br>
<br>
To punish Hera, who had led the rebellion, Zeus affixed golden bracelts to her wrists and hung her from the sky. To each of her ankles he attached an iron anvil. Zeus freed her only after her fellow Olympians, tourtured by Hera's anguished cries, vowed never again to rebel against his authority.<br>

His mother Rhea recoginized her son's enormous appetite for sexual intercourse and foresaw that it would create problems for both him, and any wife he chose. So she initially forbade Zeus to marry.<br>
<br>
Furious at his mothers interference, Zeus threatened to violate her. Upon hearing this threat, Rhea immediatly transformed herself into a vicious serpant. But Zeus did the same, tangled himself in a knot with his mother, that could not be untied, and did indeed violate her - making her the first in a long line of victims of the gods lust.<br>
<br>
Mettis, the beautiful Oceanis, who had advised him on how to free his brothers and sisters, became his first lover. A shape-shifter, Metis, transformed herself many times to escape Zeus, but Zeus finally caught up with her. The couple conceived the goddess Athena. But during teh pregnancy, Gaia prophesied that a second child by Metis would be a son who would over throw his father, and rule the heavens in his stead. Zeus know this story well.<br>
<br>
Rather then risk the fullfillment of Gaias prophecy, Zeus emulated his father-but went even further. Instead of just swallowing the children, as Cronus had done, he swallowed Metis even before she could give birth to Athena. Thereafter, Zeus claimed that Metis-who was considered wiser then even the gods-continued to provide him with advise and councel from within his belly.<br>
<br>
After Metis, Zeus mated with his beautiful aunt Themis, a Titaness. Themis and Zeus conceived several children-and this time Zeus allowed their birth. Themis gave birth to:<br>
<br>
The three Horae < Seasons > Eunomia ( law and order ), Dike ( Justice ) and Eirene ( Peace )<br>
<br>
The three Moirai < Fates > Clothos, Lachesis, and Atropos, who mete out every mortal's life span with his or her own share of good and evil.<br>
<br>
With the birth of these six daughters, Zeus-the father of all laws-completed teh job of creation: bringing order to chaos.<br>
<br>
Zeus chose as his third mistress, a sister of Metis, another Oceanis named Eurynome. She gave birth to the three graces- Aglaia, Euphrosyne, and Thalia-who personified the abstract qualities of beauty , grace and charm.<br>
<br>
Turning closer to home, Zeus next slept with his siter Demeter. Their union produced Persephone who, against her mothers will, would become the Queen of the Underworld. <br>
<br>
Zeus next lay with another Aunt, the Titaness Mnemosyne. For nine nights, this divine couple made love, Mnemosyne later gave birth to teh nine muses. Though not all story-tellers agreed on the specific functions of individual Muses, they are usually identified as follows:<br>
<br>
Cilo - the muse of history<br>
<br>
Euterpe- the muse of music and lyric poetry<br>
<br>
Thalia- the muse of comedy<br>
<br>
Melpomene-the muse of tragedy<br>
<br>
Terpsichore- teh muse of dance<br>
<br>
Erato- the muse of love poetry and marriage songs<br>
<br>
Polyhymnia- the muse of sacred song and oratory<br>
<br>
Urania- the muse of astronomy<br>
<br>
Calliope- the muse of epic or heroic poetry<br>
<br>
The sixth lover of Zeus was his cousin Leto, the daughter of the Titans Phoebe and Coeus. Leto gave birth to the most beautiful of all the Olympians: Artemis and Apollo. <p>Goddess Artemis

Zeus and Hera</span><hr size=1> AFTER Leto, Zeus found a lover who put him in seventh heaven. For his lover, his seventh, was the one he chose to marry: his sister Hera. The goddess, who no doubt knew that Zeus had already had six different lovers, did not welcome his brothers advances. So when he began courting her-in secret, so that his mother would not find out-Hera spurned his romantic overtures.<br>
<br>
CUCKOO FOR LOVE<br>
<br>
Zeus realized he needed another approach. So he appeared to her in the guise of a bedraggled- rain soaked cuckoo. Hera saw the poor bird and kindly brought him into the shelter of her bosom to warm and dry him. Zeus immediatly returned to his true form and-true to fiorm, indeed- ravished her. He thus shamed Hera into marrying him.<br>
<br>
The first wedding of Olympians was no small occasion. All the gods and goddesses attended, bringing with them, marvolous gifts. Gaia presented her granddaughter, Hera, with a wonderous tree. Hera planted this tree, richly hung with golden apples, in her garden under the care of the hesperides, nymphs who were daughters of the night ( Nyx )<br>
Hera and Zeus had a glorious wedding night, one that lasted three hundred years. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFF33>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#FFFF33> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23>The Olympian Gods</a> <font color=#FFFF33> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#FFFF33> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
