She quickly figured out who this was...it has been long since she has seen him...and then she was a young girl.  She quickly put two and two together and her face filled with concern.  She had to get back to Themiscrya.  She had to protect her beloved city and athelfi::: NO!  Hades....you must let me go back.  This can't be my time.  I need  to go back!  ::she pleaded with the lord of death.:::<br>
He laughed and smirked at her. "Hippolyte, you were killed by a Centaur," he shrugged.  "It is time for you to join the dead.  There is nothing I can do.  The Fates have cut your cord."<br>
:::Hipp moved towards him a bit.::: Parakalo.. you must send me back.  I need to help defend Themiscrya!<br>
"Oh, you tried that, Hippolyte.  You did your best,"he grinned.  For he knew he had one a prize here, the beloved granddaughter of Hera.  Point one for Hades."Now you will have to just deal with it.  And forget the amazons who live." <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

You see the centaurs raided Nat's kingdom upon our return from a centaur colony.  We had just made an alliance, and when came back in the middle of a war.  Upon riding in, a group of centaurs attacked us..-Tomias the centaur you saw me take the pendant from, was a magic sort---strange in the means of centaurs.  Well they killed my King and Queen and others as quick as a finger snap, and held me back to watch..I failed my duty as a protector and as if the deaths weren't bad enough, Tomias took this very pendant off of my neck and broke it in half.  Using magic he held the sould of those that died and I was then run through..he spilled my blood on the pendant and sealed the souls inside...then gave a half to me and the other he kept.  Then was my first confrontation with hades because I was killed, but I had to live with my guilt as the pendant brought me back...and so the sould of Natalia's entire kingdom rest in this::she hold the pendant up and smiles:: but they will be freed soon...as soon as our mission is done...&quot;<br>
