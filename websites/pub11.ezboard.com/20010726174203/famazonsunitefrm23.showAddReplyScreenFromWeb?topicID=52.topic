&quot;My sister, you people have it all wrong. Accuse me of rape you do when it was nothing of the such. I sought to win the heart of the maiden and when I told her I would return and she would bear my child, I meant I would make her love me.

&quot;I hope you heard that which I spoke to Artemis, because I dislike repeating myself.  You of All should have known better, oh Sister.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He now turns his attention to Dawnitha, his eyes glow a bit deeper now:: Next time you walk into a god's Temple, you show them the proper respect!  You don't have to worship him, but you show him the proper respect within his own Temple.  I should strike you dead for your insolence!&quot;<br>
<br>
::His gaze now turned to the three Furies:: &quot;And since when was compassion part of your repitoir?  From what I understood you three were into torturing of souls, not in the prtoection racket.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He then turnes his back and continued pacing around the room.  He then turned to face the entire room once again::  <br>
<br>
&quot;Again, do I necessarily agree with what Poseidon has done? No.  Do the Amazons need to worship any god other than the ones they choose to?  No.  But I do expect them at least not to disrespect me or any other god or goddess for that matter!  Poseidon may have overstepped his bounds.  But so have all of you this day!  You have greatly disrespected my brother!&quot;  <br>

::His finger motions all around the room on this last sentence.  Having now said his piece, he begins walking back to the rift, very slowly, and still very methodically angry:: <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uixlordhadesxi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>IX Lord Hades XI</A> at: 6/5/01 3:24:05 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uareslordofwar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ares Lord of War</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(6/5/01 4:19:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=52.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *Poseidon's Temple *</span><hr size=1> From up on Olympus, the war god feels a sudden rush of adrenaline run through his body.

&quot;Why thankyou for making my day perfect, we have everyone at each others throats...what? I thought you'd be happy to see me!&quot;<br>
with that Ares leaves the other Gods to continue with their argument! While he leaves laughing...<br>
