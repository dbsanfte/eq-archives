 With that Dawn rolled across the ground, she landed in a crotched position to the side of Aly. One foot released from the ground, as she left a kick to Aly's knees, hoping to knock them out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sartha>Sartha</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#993300>(2/8/01 7:51:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=73.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mirror Mirror</span><hr size=1> ::the amazon and the roman were once again on their feet, glaring at each other. Their silvery-golden eyes reflected the hate and coldness of each other's souls, yet there was something deeper in Sartha's eyes, a dangerous, deadly secret, and something waiting to explode inside of Sira's soul. Suddenly, the two women grinned at one another and straighten to their full height of 5'7&quot;.

&quot;Is it really? I don't quite think so, Sira. You see... there's something I know that you never could in your dimension... Something I had that you never could have.

<br>
She growled and flipped up. She didn't want to fight knowing the effect it would have on Dawn. Alysia then turned her eyes towards her son as he came out of the weapon hut holding his own sword in hand. She had a bad feeling that Wulf was what Sapphira wanted. And she was not going to let that happen. <br>
<br>
Knowing that Romans only train with their hands on bare weapons, she knew that without her hands, Sapphira would be incapable of fighting. Alysia drew a dagger and struck it straight through her palm. She screamed in agony. But it was not enough, Alysia took her bloodly hand and held the dagger as firm as she could, but it was no use. She had hurt herself so badly that she couldn't even pick up the hilt. Alysia then dropped the blade and cringed while ripping a piece of cloth from her skirt she wrapped the wound.<br>
<br>
&quot;It would have been a good idea. Perhaps it'll hold her off a bit longer.&quot;<br>
<br>
She mumbled to herself as she began to run through the village, the Roman Dawn right behind her. Alysia then reached her good hand up and caught the branch of a tree swinging herself upwards and perching herself on the branch. When Dawn came by looking for her, Alysia swung down kicking her in the back knocking her to the ground. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Sapphira Roman Queen</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(2/8/01 10:39:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=73.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Dawn. . . </span><hr size=1> Sapphira grinned at Dawn.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is a fight I have been waiting for.&quot;<br>
<br>
She knew Dawn couldn't resist the crave for her blood, Sapphira knew that same craving as she drew her sword and ran at Dawn head on. The battle was good and it seemed to last a while. <br>
<br>
Sapphira glanced over at Alysia battling the other Dawn and for a moment she thought she was standing in from of a mirror. &quot;Damn amazons!&quot;<br>
<br>
Dawn heard this and the battle became more vicious.<br>
Sapphira had to take a few steps back to catch her ground before attacking Dawn head on once again. They had their swords bareing against eachother when Sapphira leaned down and looked at Dawn...<br>
<br>
&quot;You know the difference between myself, Alysia and the others? I'm not Alysia's alternate self. I'm the evil within her. I am what she used to be, the evil still within her, and no matter what I can't die.&quot;<br>
<br>
She cackled loudly but then screamed in total pain as her sword fell to the ground and her right had began to bleed. She lost her ground and fell on her back holding her hand tightly she screamed aloud.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll get you for this Alysia!&quot;<br>
