She did not tell a soul about her departure, not that she didn't trust her family and athelfi. This was strictly instinct. <br>
<br>
It took about three weeks for the girl to return to the Village, clad in black as those soft strands of dark blonde were braided about her head. Tired oculars of the purest emerald green starred at the mighty gates before the village. Slender digets were gripped along a blanket colored in ebony as those exposed arms held onto a tiny bundle. <br>
<br>
Every time Shy returned back into the land of humans she was quiet. Something while in that feline form and in the wilderness brought back this sense of knowledge and reclusive habits which became stronger now that she had another life to care for. <br>
<br>
After a few moments of practically manican mocking in front of the gates, light materialed midnight color knee high boots made silent, graceful steps inside after the once again confusion of the guards. Those eyes, those watchful eyes, gazed about her surroundings. <br>
<br>
In her hands a child of tiny frame stirred in silence. The infant had a sense of contentment and curiousity which usually surpassed it's young days of life. Tiny eyes watched the women who inhabited the village with the same piercing green eyes of it's mother. What a beauty this child was with obvious black hair.. black hair except for the tiny bit of white which came onto the right of it's head. What a beauty with the ivory skin. With the interested look. With the future of success. Only thing was.. this beautiful child was a boy. Her gift to The Amazon Nation. <br>

Age was catching up with her, very quickly. She had escaped death, twice and so her punishment was to start aging rapidly when she reached her mid 30's. It was her curse, her punishment for escaping the grip of the OtherWorld.<br>
<br>
Now, the Queen Shamaness looked as if her late 40's had rushed over her like waves of an ocean. Her usually light blonde hair was begining to lose its pigmentation. Life had caught up with her.<br>
<br>
Her attire consisted of some baggy buck skin pants, a rope wrapped around her waist with dangling talismans and charms chiming with her movement, her upper half was covered by a long flared sleeved shirt that had a low &quot;v&quot; cut neck. <br>
<br>
Back and forth she rocked the chair all the while staring off to the Horizon and sipping her hot tea.  Suddenly, something stirred inside her, a connection grew stronger...She felt Shyriana stepping foot into her lands and a smile crossed her features.<br>
<br>
The Shamaness stood up and set her cup of tea down before stepping off her porch. Her brown leather boots carried her to the Village common, and Yakut stood regally waiting for her twin sister. <p>-|-Queen Yakut-|-<br>

She watched her for a moment like she did everything, studying it then gave a nod in greeting. &quot;Athelfi.&quot; was all she said as she gazed about for her sister. <br>
<br>
  A few steps were given to where thse senses could detect her twin before emerald hues finally found her. She frowned lightly seeing Yakut looking different. Older and less youthful, while being a guardian of the wildlife had kept her looking rather young and ageless. But she soon shook all those thoughts away and she took a few steps closer, a feeling of warmth and safety caming over her being. <br>
<br>

She finally smiled.<br>

The Shamaness felt an overwhelming happiness, she came closer to her sister and gave Shyriana a warm yet gentle embrace.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shyriana.&quot;, at this moment that was all need be spoken. After several moments of keeping her hug intact, the Amazon pulled back with a warm smile. Her eyes caught glimpse of the tiny bundle, and she felt tears welling up. Small drops rolled down her ivory cheek.<br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome home.&quot;, though she knew Shy belonged to the forest; Yakut also understood that she had a place among the Amazons as well.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me, what have you named him?&quot;, Of course Yakut knew it was a male...She was aging not her power. The Shamaness wrapped her arm around her sister's shoulder and lead her towards the Queen's hut. As they walked, Yakut pondered where Otere or Raven could be but that thought soon turned to Shyriana.<br>

  She trailed off in mid statement while walking with her sister. Those eyes gazed about, darting from object to object; person to person in both suspicion and curiousity. She didn't mean to wonder about her athelfi, her heart truely knew she could always trust them. <br>
  <br>
  Her gazing was interupted, thankfully, by Yakut's question which left Shyriana forgetting what she was doing. But she smiled lightly underneath those shoulder length braids. <br>
<br>
&quot;A journey I will never forget, that is for certain..&quot;<br>
