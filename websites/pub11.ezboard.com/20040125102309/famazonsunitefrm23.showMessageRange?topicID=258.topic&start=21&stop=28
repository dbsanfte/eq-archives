Clanking and hammering could be heard more frantically and faster.  After what was days of nonstop work, the fires of the forge slowly lessened, and the clanking slowed, eventually stopping.

And soon after there Poseidon was, another entity besides the God of the Forge, in the shop in Mount Etna. It was hot like almost every other place where Hephaestus was apt to be and Poseidon was not suprised. A gleam of sweat broke out over his body and he looked around the shop admiring the things within. <br>
<br>
Then his eyes fell on the God of the Forge and Poseidon shook his hand like a fan &quot;Boy is it hot in here, do not bring any mortal maidens in here lest they die of heat exhaustion!&quot; Poseidon mused.<br>
<br>
&quot;But anyways I heard my name from afar off and if I'm not mistaken you are the one who called?&quot; He eyes Hephaestus and shrugs, &quot;So tell me is anything wrong or do you need anything?

After he yelled out Poseidon's name, he stood there growling for a good long while, when lo and behold Poseidon himself appeared beside him.  The words that Poseidon spoke fell upon deaf ears.  His words were muffled and tuned out, he may as well have said nothing.  Hephaestus hesitated for a split second and then let loose.  Holding his forge hammer, he struck Poseidon across the face.  Now most people, if they did not die from the blow would at least be knocked unconcious for quite some time.  With as strong and powerful as Poseidon was, he would at least be knocked off his feet, but probably not be knocked out.::<br>
<br>
::Hephaestus stood over his uncle with a look of absolute anger in his eyes.  And just when he looked as if he were about to strike again, he threw his hammer to the side::  &quot;HOW DARE YOU, UNCLE!?!&quot;<br>
<br>
::His breathing was heavy, he was like a beast let loose::<br>
<br>
&quot;YOU LIED TO ME!?!  You told me Athena had feelings!  She didn't!  You used me as a Pawn in your sick game for Revenge!?!<br>

::The temperature in the room only seemed to get hotter and hotter.  The best way to describe it would be Hell on a Bad Summer day.  Mount Etna shook again, as if slowly reaching its boiling point::<br>

The sea god felt exulted inside and good because of the way his plan turned out to be an accomplishment, well almost an accomplishment! Then he wondered at the hammer which Hephaestus held in his hand and swung about suddenly to crack him on the skull a bit too late. All the god could do was look at the arc of the swing as if he were powerless to do anything about it and it did hit and pretty hard. The Olympian was tossed to the side by the impact of the blow and his shoulder hit a wall in the mountain causing it to rumble even more so. Then the God toppled and fell on his back after sliding over a table full of tools which fell on him as he fell onto the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;Arg!!&quot; mumbled Poseidon at the pain that ripped through his body. With his strong hand he massaged the side of his head, his face now a mask of pain and his eyes shut tight in agony. But quickly the pain was subsiding and his mind was no longer distracted by the pain that was stinging and hurting.<br>
<br>
There above him hephaestus was screaming and getting him annoyed. The clinking of the hammer rang clear in his ears when it hit the ground a few yards away. The misted eyes of the God looked upon the face of the God of the Forge and it was blurry at first till his eyes cleared and began to burn with a power that few of the Gods or Goddesses could withstand if unleashed.<br>
<br>
Slowly rose Poseidon up to his feet and he stood before the lame god. He was not too stable on his feet but he was there and quite shaken up but recovering quickly. The king of the seas raised his hand and called for silence. &quot;Quit your yapping oh lame one. So what if you were a pawn in my plans you were just an unfortunate victim. How could you think Athena actually fell for you you fool?&quot; he laughed and then grimaced in pain. <br>
<br>
Then sharply and quickly the arm of Poseidon shot out at Hephaestus' chest to push him away and it was a hard push not a soft one. The pain was now a small thing that was at the back of his head now and an evil grin showed on his face. &quot;Learn your manners smithy or you'll have more than one hobble leg!&quot; <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uixhephaestusxi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>IX Hephaestus XI</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(8/4/02 3:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=258.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I'll show you manners...</span><hr size=1> ::Hephaestus staggered back from the force of the push.  Because of his lame leg, he did lose his footing and fell on his back.  Hephaestus looked up at his Uncle who now stood over him.  Hephaestus slowly rose to his feet.  He picked up his hammer and he picked up his walking crutch::<br>
<br>
::His eyes seemed to burn with the fire that fueled this forge.  In some respects he was the God of Fire as well as God of the Forge::<br>
<br>
&quot;Manners!?! You pompous, loud-mouthed, manipulative, bastard!&quot;<br>
<br>
::The mountain shook violently yet again with his fury and the ground started breaking slightly.  Red-hot magma started seeping from the walls of the forge.  Mount Etna had now reached the point of no return, it was going to erupt.  And with it, so was Hephaestus.::<br>
<br>
&quot;You are right, Poseidon, Lord of the Sea.  I was fool for believing that.  But there is an old saying...'You play with fire, you WILL get burned!&quot;<br>
<br>
::With that, the lava began filling the room of the forge.  Hephaestus himself seemed unaffected by it.  As a matter of fact, he knelt down to touch it with his fingers.  He rolled it around in his hands and looked at his Uncle::<br>
<br>
&quot;A couple of degrees cooler than I'm used to.  But that won't make much of a difference.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He threw the ball of magma at his Uncle's feet, which the rest of the lava was slowly approaching as well.  Hephaestus simply let the lava overtake his feet.  He was not affected by it.  This as Mount Etna rumbled yet again.  Hephaestus was now beyond rage.  He had become methodical::<br>
<br>
&quot;No doubt to try and counteract this lava, you will try and bring in the salty sea water to cool it down.  That could have one of several effects.  You will simply only solidify the top layer and the lava will keep moving.  It will cause so much steam and smoke, the eruption will magnify.  Or if you do manage to cool all the lava down, you will encase us both for eternity or till next time the rock melts, which could be a long time.  Or you could simply tuck tail and leave.  The choice is yours dear Uncle.&quot;<br>

Knew he not that he could never hope to overcome his uncle, even if his power were incresed two-fold.  Poseidon stood with that evil grin on his face still and he did not even flinch as the ball of molten liquid was tossed before him, nor did he care for the destruction of the work place. The lava slowly enveloped his feet and the burn did indeed began to bother the God who kicked up the liquid and moved back away from the encircling molten. <br>
<br>
Then in came Persephone screaming and the god watched as she amusingly jumped onto Hephaestus' back in freight. He shook his head and said &quot;Hephaestus you are right but you should know that my powers range far beyond that both physically and otherwise. I could not be held by some liquid fire nor can any bondage you seek to put me in keep me at bay. No weapon on earth but the Thunder bolts of Zeus can surpass the power of my Trident by which I destroy what I will and cause the seas to arise in tumult.&quot; He laughed arrogantly. &quot;And even without my Trident I can deal with the likes of you. But I shall take your advice and take my leave of you before you put yourself in a predicament you wish you had not!&quot; <br>
<br>
Poseidon blinked and the molten lava stood still as if frozen yet still it burned hot and his eye glew and the mountain appeared to be as it was before the smithy lost his cool. And before leaving the presence of Hephaestus the sea god smiled to Persephone and said &quot;Be nice dear, it is safe!&quot; and then he winked at her. Then looking on the smithy once again Poseidon said &quot;Another time Hephaestus and hopefully on better terms. I'm not one to be known to control my anger so youare indeed lucky this time but do not test your luck.&quot; With that the room thundered and shook as if the whole montain would collapse. Poseidon was gone and the spot in which he had stood was blackened with a rising dark smoke. <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uixhephaestusxi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>IX Hephaestus XI</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(8/14/02 3:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=258.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Some like it hot...</span><hr size=1> ::Hephaestus watched his uncle quietly.
