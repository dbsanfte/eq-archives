It was as if blood was calling for blood, as Hermes entire being ached for his father's presence.<br>
<br>
Hermes saw his wave of relatives part for Zeus, many bowed, some curtsied, and some did nothing.  He knew many here were testing Zeus's limits, to see if any weakness may have fallen upon him since the last time they had met.<br>
<br>
But from the aura emanating from Zeus, that seemed almost tangible, only the foolish would dare to mistread in his presence.  And Hermes knew his father knew who dared to plot, and who had malice within their hears.<br>
<br>
Bowing and paying respect just as his mother had taught him to do,  Hermes finally felt whole.  He hadn't realized how much was missing inside him before.  Even though he had never met Zeus until now, Hermes realized that he was inextricably and perpetually tied in with Zeus.  He realized that Hermes would lay down his life if Zeus so commanded.<br>
<br>
All this flashed into young Hermes mind when Zeus pronounced and granted him the status of an Olympian.  With such a powerful ruler and father standing up for him and his mother, any  who would dare to cause harm to either of them, would surely and quickly feel the wrath of Zeus.<br>
<br>
As Zeus finished his blessing of Hermes, Hermes could tell by the whispers and agitated movements within the room that many were not happy with this.  They had hoped to somehow redistribute his newfound roles amongst themselves.  But now, the roles were forever his.<br>
<br>
Hermes looked up, proud, and stared into his father's eyes.<br>
::Father, if you can hear me, I swear to you that I will never let you down.<br>

Now her son would meet his father and his seat on Olympus would be set and recognized.  As she followed Zeus, once could see how proud she was to have been his mistress.  He was an incredible God and very powerful.  And now her son would know a power close to that of his father.  With this she would be very satisfied. <br>
She looked up at Zeus as he came to her and smiled up at him. &quot;Yes, my King, I know the Queen's anger and I am not surprised that she has sent someone after me,&quot; she stood up and delicatly touched his chest. &quot;I shall never regret being your mistress and the mother of Hermes.&quot;<br>
Her look drifted to Hermes, and she turned to face him. &quot;Now with your father here, I shall leave you in his watch.  For you are now an Olympian, my son.&quot;  Maia walked over to Hermes and lovingly gave him a hug.  The hug envoking all the power and love a mother can give to his heart and soul. &quot;Take care, my son,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;And do not forget me.&quot;<br>
She again looked to Zeus, &quot;Until we meet again, my love.&quot; Maia winked at Zeus and then turned towards the door and left the temple, a happy and proud mother. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/umeihao.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meihao</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(7/4/01 3:18:56 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Mother Don't Leave</span><hr size=1> Shocked, Hermes turned to his mother. <br>

::Mother what are you saying?  Are you not going to stay with me?  I can't do this alone, and I need you.  Don't leave!!<br>
<br>
Hermes began to cry, for he had not known that by coming to Olympus, he would have to leave his mother.  These were still strangers to him.  Yes they are family, but this is the woman he loves, and will always love.  He could not understand why she was leaving.<br>
<br>
::Mother I want to go with you.  I'm a god too, right?  So I can be with you and be here too.  It would be ok, just don't leave me!!<br>
<br>
Hermes cried with a heart torn in two, he ran racing after his mother.<br>

If your mother stays, her life is in danger and I fear that with Hera's rage it will not be a very long life nor a very quick ending.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that he gently moved his son towards him, reaffirming his acceptance of his son. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/umeihao.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meihao</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(7/4/01 5:34:53 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Caduceus</span><hr size=1> What could Hermes do?  he wanted so desperately to run away with his mother, and just forfeit his godhood.  But he knew that he could not.  He realized the truth in his mother's words, and his father had already stepped in.<br>
<br>
Looking up at his father, Hermes realized that if he disobeyed, he would be disobeying not only his father, but also his king.  And he knew that punishment would be swift and harsh.  For no one could disobey the king without being punished, even if the king happened to be your own father.<br>
<br>
With tears streaming down his face, Hermes realized that he had to grow up.  He had an important role in this cosmic play.  He needed to grow so that he could properly become the Messenger of the gods.<br>
<br>
So Hermes reached out and took his mother's hand.  With his other, Hermes took his father's.  And he closed his eyes and wished, he prayed that one day, the three of them could be together, and never again have to worry nor fear.<br>
<br>
What happened next, Hermes could not be sure.  But he felt energy flooding into him, bathing him.  It was as if a switch within himself had suddenly been turned on, and he now had access to his true innate power.<br>
<br>
A nimbus surrounded the three, a glorious gold surrounded his father, a soft pink around his mother.  Around Hermes, was a soft blue that slowly began to deepen in hue.  Within this aura, Hermes knew that now was the time to shed his childhood, it was time to become a man.<br>
<br>
His soft curly down of brunette hair darkened into a strong mahogany shade.  The baby fat that surrounded his face slowly melted away, leaving Hermes a face of that of a young man.  He also started to grow.  At first he was only a little taller than his father's knees, but as he grew, he passed his father's waist, his chest, and finally stopped just past his father's shoulders.  He was strong, not bulky muscular like that of his brother Hephaestus, but that of a world-class runner.<br>
<br>
And suddenly, the aura became so dark that it hid Hermes from view.  As suddenly as it had come, the aura disappeared, and Hermes could be seen decked out enitrely in his godly reignment.  Crowning his head was a golden winged helmet, carved with runes and deeds that were yet to come.  Upon his ankles sprouted feathery wings, that gently flapped as if anxious to take flight.  And in the air before him, a caduceus floated, a winged staff with two serpents in perpetual entwinement.<br>
<br>
Hermes leaned over and gently kissed his mother on her cheek.  And before he let them go, he realized that another symbolic gesture was needed.  And so he brought his father's hand over her mother's.  When he released the hands, his father was holding his mother's.<br>
<br>
And Hermes knew, as everyone else in the room did, that no matter where his mother might be, his father would always be by her side.  And beware to those who may seek to harm her, for a husband angered, a king enraged, would destroy heaven and hell to seek out the culprit.<br>
<br>
Smiling to himself, Hermes reached out and took his staff.  He was now an Olympian.<br>

Then turned around and walked out of the temple, trying to be the strong mother, knowing this was the way it had to be.  It was time for Hermes to be an Olympian. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showMessageRange?topicID=63.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showMessageRange?topicID=63.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showMessage?topicID=100.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showMessage?topicID=98.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.emailToFriend?topicID=63.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.threadControl?topicID=63.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/blueMoon/deleteThread.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=63.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=63.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm37">The Mythical Odyssey Forum<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitefrm32">The Mythical Odyssey<option value="amazonsunitefrm35">Amazon Nation Alliance<option value="amazonsunitefrm33">Character Descriptions<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm30">Amazons of the Sacred Circle<option value="amazonsunitefrm34">Amazons of Lesvos Island<option value="amazonsunitefrm38">High Mountain Tiger Clan<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm28">Amazon Sisters of Cremni<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm31">Amazon Language<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF33>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#FFFF33> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23>The Olympian Gods</a> <font color=#FFFF33> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#FFFF33> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
