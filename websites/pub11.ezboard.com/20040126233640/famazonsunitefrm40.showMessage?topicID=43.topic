Within the forest the flickering of a small fire could be seen in the distance. Hope sat upon the ground slowly feeding sticks and burnables into the flame. She could have created the fire with a simple thought, but on that small chance someone were to appear, especially an Amazon, she did not wish to cause alarm.<br>
<br>
Hope held the appearance of a traveller resting for the night. True...she was dressed completely in black travel clothing, with her long black hair tied back, but she would simply remind those she spoke to of her desire to go unnoticed from any possible thieves or untrustworthy travellers. She had used her powers to take the life of a man just outside of Chadesia lands. He had a certain untrustworthy look to him, and Hope had need what few gold dinars he owned anyway. At any rate, his life's passing was not within these lands so their rules did not apply as far as she was concerned.<br>
<br>
She allowed herself to relax as she thought upon the Chadesia lands and Queen Varia. Very little had been spoken of this Queen by her mother. Of course her mother was not given to details of Amazon leadership. Hope knew that informants would need to be paid.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow after a night well rested, Hope would travel further into Chadesia lands. She had been here just a few weeks ago anyway. It had been a campfire ceremony where many had attended. She had made a few nods of recognition to those who were there. Perhaps that would be enough to gain confidence... to aid in her plans of gaining runes and burial markers from the Amazon burial grounds of Chadesia. Time would tell... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udaughterofshylock.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daughter of Shylock</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#993300>(5/20/02 2:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=43.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Up To No Good</span><hr size=1> A large burst of fire was given in front of Hope and standing in it's place as the smoke cleared was none other than Kimbia herself. With narrowed eyes she reached her hand up hitting Hope across the face hard enough to knock her to the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;Queen Alysia is raging. Your death nears very soon Mother.&quot;<br>
Black flames arose and when they cleared Kimbia was once again gone.<br>
<br>
<br>
A few moments of silence passed before a soft growl was heard comming from behind Hope. Standing there was a large demonic looking tiger baring it's teeth fiercly. Around it's neck was a golden medallion with Tretmolec markings upon it. Piercing blue eyes glared at the Goddess as it's claws dug into the ground preparing to attack.<br>
<br>
Hope had made a vital mistake. She had crossed into Orio-Pata and had taken a sacred stone. If Hope had studied the amazons a bit more, she would know that the Queen of Orio-Pata was none other than Lilla Darkshade, the daughter of Dawnithinia. But this fierce animal was not Lilla. For the tiger wore a Scynthian medallion. This was the workings of Alysia.<br>
<br>
A snarl was given from the large beast as he prepared to strike. This was none other than the legendary Wulf. Son of Dawnithinia and Alysia. With the strengths of both his mothers and each shapeshifting powers. And Hope thought Alysia and Kimbia would be a problem . . . . <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenvaria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QueenVaria</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://hometown.aol.com/variaavande/images/tsianina2.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 491<br> <font color=#993300>(5/20/02 6:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=43.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/cristalc15/images/varia3sm.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Up To No Good</span><hr size=1> Var would have made an appearance, but she didn't since Wulf had it under control. <p><html> <center> <font face="vivaldi" size="+2" color="#ff0000"> ~Varia Angelina Avande~ </font> </html></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugabbyshope.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GabbysHOPE</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#993300>(5/21/02 10:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=43.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://images.channeladvisor.com/Sell/SSProfiles/30005913/Images/gabares.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Up To No Good</span><hr size=1> Hope made certain to keep the campfire in her thoughts as she spoke to the demonic creature behind her. She had a sense for such characteristics in others. <br>
<br>
&quot;You protect the Amazons and their lands.&quot; Hope spoke thoughtfully as if studying something of mild interest. &quot;You would protect them all from harm.&quot;<br>
<br>
As her back was to the creature, her eyes lifted up to the tree tops as a faint bright glow of the campfire flickered across their giant tree tops. Her eyes narrowed and the trees had their own glow. Several of the trees around them were on fire. The forest canopy of upper leaves was quickly set ablaze with fire threatening the entire forest if not dealt with.<br>
<br>
She was not beyond destroying a respectable section of the entire Amazon forest to make her escape or to make a point.<br>
<br>
In those few seconds the creature may have looked up at the wonderous but threatening site, the campfire made a great roar as a simple burning shot up as a blinding inferno but for a few brief seconds. Seconds in which one might blink or turn slightly to get used to the brightness. Seconds Hope used to virtually disappear... hidden behind one of several dozen ancient large pine trees that surrounded the area.... she would not be so easy a catch... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugabbyshope.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GabbysHOPE</A> at: 5/21/02 10:36:44 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uxxdemeterxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xxDemeterxx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#993300>(5/22/02 10:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=43.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Forest on fire???</span><hr size=1> :*: Demeter appeared in a blast of cold air, her eyes wide and filled with anger and rage.

She looked down at the Demonic Tiger and sighed softly.<br>
<br>

The tiger shifted quickly into the form of his human self. He stood a bit over 6 foot, and had shaggy blonde hair, and was built rather well wearing amazon leathers.<br>
