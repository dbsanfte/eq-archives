She had been lying there for no more than an hour, unconcious from the blow to the head. She looked harmless, no weapons except a staff for walking; that now lay next to the almost lifeless body. <br>
<br>
How did it happen? She was approached from behind by a man in a Roman uniform, and attacked her by word of Caesar. Not knowing the cause, the Roman only did what he was told; seeing as the woman looked identical to the Warrior Princess herself. The only real reason known to the woman's beating was the woman herself and the Roman Emporer, Caesar.<br>
<br>
What a turn of evenst this was for the Woman. Around her neck, was a necklace given to her by a close friend to the family, a pendant very similar to the pendants the Loire's wore around their neck, only it didn't have &quot;Loire&quot; written on it in Scynthian letters; instead it had &quot;Leandros&quot; written on it. That would give those who found her a clue of who this woman was. <p>~*~ Meg Leandros ~*~

Yes, that was right, Dawn had returned from the long time of death, and had vowed to visit her daughter upon her claiming of Orio-Pata. It only seemed fitting, that since many were staying in the village, that the old Queen return for a visit.<br>
<br>
 Now, when one is waiting for the arrival of her mother, she doesn't expect to find a Xena look alike badly beaten, battered, and unconcious. <br>
<br>
 Dark hazel pools fell upon Meg, and right then, Lilla almost fainted herself. Quickly she rushed to Meg's side, gently tapping her cheeks.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Wake up! Wake up!&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn arched a brow, wandering up behind her daughter. <br>
<br>
 &quot;What are you doing? OH--&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn kneeled on the other side of Meg, slowly grabbing a few herbs from the ground. It seemed the assassin had been around Scynthia for to long. Slowly she waved them infront of Meg's nose, hoping this would snap her back into her concious state of mind.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Mom, who is this?&quot; Lilla questioned, immediately wanting answers for a crime being committed on Orio-Patan land.<br>
<br>
 &quot;This is Meg Leandros. She's very close with the Scynthian Royalty... MEG! Wake up!&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn yelled, her daughter gently slapping her cheeks once more. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/umegleandros.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meg Leandros</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#939393>(8/3/02 10:05:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=40.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://xenarulz.topcities.com/xena/chakram-xena06.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One to Help the Beaten, and One to Kill for the Beaten.</span><hr size=1> Meg came too after the scent of the herbs, the shouting, and and patting.

<br>
&quot;Anybody get the number of that damn chariot?&quot;<br>
<br>
She blinked, waiting for her eyes to focus straight. When they did, she looked to Lilla, and blinked, then to Dawn. She recognized Dawn from the Academy the girls were from, and she looked around.<br>
<br>
&quot;....Where am I?&quot;<br>
<br>
She held her head, having a majour headache from the blow to the head. All she could remember was seeing the Roman's face before he knocked her down.  <p>~*~ Meg Leandros ~*~

<br>
 Seeing as Dawn was on the look out for more attackers, Lilla took over the handling of where Meg was.<br>
<br>
 &quot;You're on the outer limits of Orio-Pata. I'm Orio-Pata's new Queen.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Lilla glanced reassuringly to her mother, who turned immediately to Meg.<br>

She took in a deep breath, and sighed. Who did this to her? Heh, that was an easy question; and since it happened to her. She was going to NOT be happy to see the person ever again.<br>
<br>
&quot;...A Roman, tall, black hair. It wasn't Caesar, but...it was one of Caesar's men. I could tell from the crest of the helmet her wore.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked to Dawn. Maybe he thought she was Xena? No. It was because of something else. Not only was it because of their Halfbreed son, he saw Meg as no more use to him. Only a milstone around his neck. He wouldn't kill her, no. That would be his demise. <br>
<br>
&quot;...I guess he saw me as a threat...li'l ole me.&quot;<br>

 Lilla nodded in turn to her mother and started helping Meg to her feet.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Come I'll talk you back to the village, you can see a physican or go home to family. I think my mother has the vengence side taken care of.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn laughed lightly, whistling lowly for a black stallion, which soon jogged to the assassins side.<br>
<br>
 &quot;It was Caesar..right? Right. It was a Roman Crest. I'll be back in a few days. I'm sorry I can't visit on time Lilla.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Before Lilla could protest, Dawn was already in the saddle, and heading back towards Rome.<br>
<br>
 Lilla sighed, and slowly leaned over to grab Meg's staff. She then held it out to the woman.<br>
<br>
