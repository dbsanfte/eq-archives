He winked at his wife from across the room as the ceremony started.  He could feel her wrath from the distance separating them and was not eager to feel her anger from a closer distance.  <br>
<br>
He quietly observed the ceremony as the couple exchanged vows.   Then as Erris appeared with her sharp tongue and her dismissal of justice and fairness.  It was no wonder in his mind that she was not invited for she would have done precisely what it was she was about to do either way.<br>
<br>
Leaning against a column, the king of the gods merely observed.  He would not interfere, but would rather that his wife be distracted in her fury towards him by what appeared at this point to be a benign game.  Though he knew that this game would be so much more then benign, especially in the mortal world, he allowed the events to unfold on their own. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uchaoticgoddesseris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chaotic Goddess Eris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(10/23/01 11:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/chaoticdiscordxx/images/eris2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Observance of the King of the Gods</span><hr size=1> ::Eris smirked as she could almost taste what her father was saying.

They were pussycats compared to her young neice. Perhaps it would be better for her daughter to be in the Underworld with Hades during this time, for Persephone is drastically underestimating the Goddess of Discord.*** <br>

<br>
She knew that everyone ignoring Eris would piss her off even more, then maybe she'd actually get to the point of all this.<br>

&quot;Why hello Dear Uncle.&quot; She gave a wavering smile to Poseidon. The war over Athens took place not so long ago, which meant that both of the Olympians were still a bit harsh in words towards one another, Athena tried her best to keep them simple.<br>

Spotting his dear sister and step-mother he waltzed his way over to them with a smile.<br>
<br>
He sipped his wine, looking over the goblet to meet the dark eyes of his silvery sister. Himself...he was glowing with his usual golden warmth. He said:<br>
<br>
&quot;Is it me, or is something just not right about this?...&quot; he turned his head and looked to his step, Eris. His face scrunched up, she was to much like Ares, and everyone knew how well the &quot;pacifist&quot; and the &quot;warlord&quot; got along. He looked back to his sister and mother, a look of slight disgust upon him. He stuck out his tounge and laughed, again sipping his wine.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope she doesn't try anything...opprobrious... I mean, it is a wedding. But knowing Eris, she has something up her sleeve just waiting to spill out onto the floor.&quot;<br>

He looked at Artemis once more before taking her by the wrist and basically dragging her over to Athena.<br>
