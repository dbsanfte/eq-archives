She had always had a connection with the water, not surprising really considering how her life had been. Nowadays, when she was out and about, she would always be found either near a stream, or near that fountain.<br>
Today, the young amazon woman was focussed on a scroll that she was writing. It was intended to be a message for Queen Sumeria of the Shatomlic Amazons, her best friend. It had been a while since she had set foot in Hyrcania, and was looking forward to the trip back. She missed a lot of things hthere, most especially Hiroshi, though she had told him herself that it would be best for him not to come to Themisycra with her.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sumeria,<br>
Yasoo! How are you? It has been a long time since I have seen you, in fact, it has been a long time since I have seen any of the Shatomlics. I trust they are all well?<br>
I am at Themisycra at the moment, next to the fountain in the village square. You'll have to come and see it some time, it is amazing. Have you seen Hiroshi of late? I think he said something about going back to Arabia until I returned?<br>
I have been awfully busy. Life in Themisycra is a lot different to anything in Hyrcania. Adjusting has certainly being quite the task! I think I will have to soon ask someone about their culture, try to learn something, maybe then I can teach the Shatomlics a thing or two when I return!<br>
Anyway, I had better be off, I have a lot to do this morning, and less time to do it in.<br>
Good bye for now. Your sister,<br>
Kalasin</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
The young amazon nodded, satisfied with her letter. She folded it neatly and put it in her boot along with the quill, where she would not forget it. Then she stood and stretched her long limbs, and went to find an amazon that could teach her about the culture and tradition of Themisycra. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=melanippeamazon>Melanippe Amazon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#993300>(4/17/03 3:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=460.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/ddelektradd/images/melanippesm.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Seeking Lessons</span><hr size=1> The young amazon warrior Mel saw Kalasin as she was leaving on to the huts in the village. Mel smiled and ran over to her almost triping on a stick. Regaining her balance she smiled broadly and said,&quot; Yasoo! I hope I am not interupting you... its just that every one is fighting with the ex-romans so no one is here and I was getting board. My name is Melanippe, but you can call me Mel.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mel offered her hand for the other amazon to shake. The grin on her face was almost dorky, but she ment well. <p>~*~ Melanippe &quot;black Horse&quot; ~*~ <br>

She did not get spoken to often, and she suspected that sometimes it could be because she never projected a very friendly appearance. The amazon woman took her hand and shook it firmly.<br>
&quot;Yasoo Mel&quot; the amazon replied in a friendly tone, her thick accent making her Greek slightly hard to understand. &quot;I am Kalasin Ti'Ya-Kuk'Tai.&quot; She pauses for a moment to get her thoughts in order, and to try and translate what she wanted to say to Greek, so that she would not slip into Latin or Arabic by mistake, as she often did, &quot;Why are you not with the fighting? And you are in no way, shape or form interrupting me&quot;<br>

&quot;No, I was born in Rome, spend a lot of time in the far east, and currently live in Hyrcania with the Shatomlic Amazons. So I am not from around here at all, as you may have noticed by the accent.&quot; She shrugged. &quot;But I try to fit in as best as possible.

<br>
&quot;The Shatomlic Amazons are not in Greece.&quot; she said, &quot;We reside in the city of Hyrcania on the bottom most point of the Caspian Sea.&quot; She pauses, once again trying to sort her thoughts, &quot;We are ruled by Queens Sumeria and Eumache, and I am the former Princess, but current Personal Advisor to Sumeria.&quot; she chuckles as she thinks fondly of her best friend. &quot;We are not very steep in traditions, I rarely even address the two of them as 'Queen'.&quot;<br>
<br>
The 21-year-old amazon stopped for a moment, thinking hard.<br>
