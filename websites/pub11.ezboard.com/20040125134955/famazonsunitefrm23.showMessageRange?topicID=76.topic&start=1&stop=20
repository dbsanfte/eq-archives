::A look of despair strikes Pluto for a brief moment as Hades looks around to all the gathered souls and says:: &quot;Will someone please show this poor Fool the way out of here?&quot;  <br>
<br>
::And with that, the entire horde of gathered souls converged upon Pluto, included in the onslaught was Cerberus, Thanatos, and Hades himself.  Before he knew it, Pluto found himself chained and shackled.  Hades then nodded to Thanatos and Cerberus to lead Pluto out of here and to take him back to the rift he came from.  Hades followed behind the procession marching like coming from a victorious battle even though it took only a point of a finger to beat him::<br>

::Hades grabbed Pluto by the back of his head and spoke to him quietly:: &quot;You really should not be attacking me...we in actuality should be working together.  Perhaps one day when you learn your lessons, we will be allies and not foes.  But until that day.  STAY IN  YOUR OWN REALM.  You will not defeat me in my Underworld nor Olympus.  Just as I know I would not be able to defeat you in your home realm.&quot;<br>

He smiled as the sunlight warmed his body. He figured he was alone and so he started to talk to himself. He rolled over in the hammock and admired himself in the pond below.<br>
<br>
&quot;How do you do it Apollo?&quot; he said rather arrogantly, brushing his sandy blonde locks back and smiling at himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Always so good looking, its like Homer's poetry but in motion!&quot; he said with a laugh, mimicing a interviewer. He noticed a bit of ambrosia caught between his teeth and wrinkled his nose.<br>
<br>
&quot;Eew!&quot; he shrieked, trying to pick it out. He succeeded.<br>
<br>
&quot;There we go, perfect as always! I love being me!&quot; he said adoring himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;So do I.&quot; said a voice comming from the shadows of the near by forest. Apollo jumped at the voice getting himself tangled in the hammock. He untangled himself, regaining his composure and stood up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who is there?! Show yourself.&quot; he said, dusting himself off. He cursed under his breath. 'This is my favorite toga!' he thought to himself. From the shadows stepped Phoebus, his Roman counterpart. Phoebus was a less elegant looking form of himself but still as stunning to the eyes. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh its you...again.&quot; Apollo spat. &quot;I thought we did away with you for the final time the last time we met.&quot; Apollo snickered. He noticed the other Apollo was something less than perfect.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stand up straight, brush your hair back, chest out!&quot; Apollo shouted. &quot;I will not have you make ME look bad to those Romans.&quot; Apollo said, trying not to laugh as Phoebus actually tried to do as he was told. Phoebus then realized he had to listen to no one and returned to his normal, less than perfect state.<br>
<br>
&quot;You haven't changed a bit Apollo, your still the same old big mouthed, arrogant, fool I left before.&quot; Phoebus muttered, his lip curling into a smirk.<br>
<br>
'Oh no he didn't!' Apollo said to himself. &quot;And your still the same, run of the litter, scoliosis stricken, gingavitis overtaken, loud mouthed...&quot; he began to walk closer to Phoebus, and Phoebus walked backward. &quot;... biggoting, hippocritical, ugly, bastard I watched burn into the pits of hell last time.&quot; Apollo said with a smile, his last few words he jammed his index finger into Phoebus's chest. Phoebus grabbed Apollo's hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please, remove your apendage from my chest.&quot; he said in a rather snoody tone.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fine, I will place it in your stomach!&quot; Apollo laughed, as he lunged his fist into the rather soft stomach of Phoebus. Apollo smirked as he watched his less than carbon copy counter part fall to the ground in pain.<br>
<br>
&quot;And they say Hephaestus is the lamest of all the gods...Hmph&quot; Apollo grunted as he rubbed his fist. 'That hurt...' he thought to himself.<br>
