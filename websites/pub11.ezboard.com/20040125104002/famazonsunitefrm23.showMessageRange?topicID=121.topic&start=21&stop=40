&quot;Ares, you are VERY misinformed about my involvement in this petty little war.  I NEVER told Hypnos that I would intercede on his side.  I only get involved in wars on two conditions.  One it is an outward threat to Olympus.  Second if it is an internal threat it will completely change and unbalance the power structure.  This conflict does not qualify as either situation.  I told him the same thing.  So whoever you got your information from is wrong.&quot;<br>

::Mojo with his enormous strength and the cobalts, cut through the most of the small army of centaurs like hot butter until he could get to the catapults.

Allowing the cobalts to fight it out with the centaurs, he slowly walked over to Dionysus.  He knew better than to strike a god since he himself was not one.  He set the axe head on the ground holding onto the handle showing he would not attack him::<br>

&quot;Dionysus...You are not a war god.  Therefore I SUGGEST you step off the battlefield, for it is not your domain.  I know better than to strike or attack you personally, but that same respect is not extended to that 'army' you brought with you.  Therefore I suggest you lead them off the field before they are all dead.&quot;<br>

::He then turns away from Dionysus and started hacking through the centaurs again, with his axe, gorging a few of them in their bodies with his large horns.  Once it looks as though the Cobalts are descimating and the centaurs are almost completely destroyed, he turns his attention to the front.

Since none of them had officially crossed the river yet, there still was the possibility of coming back.  This angered him though.  He only shook his head slightly.  He would not ream out Hypnos in front of the others.  Hypnos after all does reside in the Underworld as well, so this was not business for anyone other than those who reside in the Underworld, in his mind.  He merely walked up to Hypnos and patted him on the shoulder::<br>

He wondered what was going on in there as the shadows of the tent seemed to lighten up a bit.  He then shook his head, realizing he didn't care.  He simply slung the battle axe back into the holder on his back.  He realized he had been used as a mere pawn.  He hated that.  More than anything he hated being manipulated.
