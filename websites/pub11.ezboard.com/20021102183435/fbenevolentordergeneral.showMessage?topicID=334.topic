Many of you have observed or heard of the curse in the karanas and now lfay.  It seems that Lanys T'vyll has been resurrected and is working on obtaining a staff greater than fironia vie and her lifeguide staff!  For those who dont know, Lany's T'vyll instigated the war dubbed &quot;bloody kithicor&quot;  It is responisble for why kithicor is the way it is at night.  These strong hints lead many to believe another war may be coming.  <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.1fol.cjb.net/">The Fists of Light</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> have gathered quite a bit of information on this subject, it can be found on their message boards. <br>
<br>
Anway, I wanted to inform you all about this, but even more importantly,  LETS GET INVOLVED!  BO should be fighting against the evils that are rising!  If anyone wants to start checking into events, I suggest you start with queynos, queynos catacombs, karanas, or lfay.  These seem to be the areas of major import.  although there are rumors of the minions of evil springing up in other locations.  I'll start looking into this but I would like some help.  There are quite a few quests and special events associated with this and its too much for one person to look into.<br>

Even a level 1 character could help a little.  We need to start takin to any NPC's that are not already associated with other quests or other purposes.  Right now the areas to really look into are lfay, karanas, WC, EC, kithicor, and queynos (including catacombs and queynos hills).  That is a lot of ground to check with a lot of possible NPC's.  Also, your characters race/deity/faction may go into play here.  So quite simply, we need to have people of varying factions talk to the NPC's of these primary suspect areas.  We can expand the search from there.  I would Like to see a new thread started with at least one message from every member posting information regarding this.  I'll let vargussal start the thread since he's agreed to start researching this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   From this new thread maybe we can start to piece together the clues.  I also recommend that we have some people researching other guilds' message boards as well as public EQ message boards on the EQ related sites.  As far as i've seen, these events don't seem to be getting a whole lot of attention from people on OUR server, however, i've had some luck with guilds on other servers looking into this.  Lastly, keep an eye out for any talk of more GM events.  We really need to try to start getting someone there for these to get first hand knowledge of the event.<br>

<br>
Problem is that not every member regularly, if at all, interfaces with this board.<br>
<br>
If I may offer a suggestion;<br>
<br>
What I suggest is seeing if we can allocate different zones to different members on a voluntary basis. Get people to be responsible for a zone. Even a city zone since many of the NPCs with information can be found in those places. <br>
<br>
  Being restricted or KOS to a specific city/zone shouldn't be a problem. Just log in a new character that is has good faction there. Ex. Create an Ogre and then go talk to all the NPCs in the Ogre city. The exceptions would be areas lke LFay for example where you want someone that has wolf form <br>
<br>
I have no problem taking responsibility for any of the evil cities since it can be done in that fashion. <br>
<br>
I would however suggest to have the less traveled areas be taken by the Wizards/Druids/Shamans/Ranger who have Port and or SOW. Other areas may require the use of a Druid/Ranger for tracking to find wandering NPCs. This of course would not be a requirement since I would be happy with someone who took responsibility for any zone.  <br>
<br>
 Varg would of course still be main coordinator unless he  declines. We could all report our findings to him and he could start a thread posting what he has found. This again is just a suggestion so it is up to Varg how he wants to handle it.<br>
<br>
 So if no objection maybe we could start a thread with people signing up to take responsibility for different zones. Those wishing to help but who don't use the or have access to the boards could be signed up by Varg or someone who does.<br>

*Paste*<br>
<br>
Hi Guys,<br>
<br>
this appeared on my guild's mailing list, apparently picked up from the Drinal message board<br>
(I had a quick look, didn't see anything obvious there) :<br>
<br>
============================================================<br>
War in EQ.<br>
<br>
General Notes:<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Dwarch is serving as War Leader; Zathrax is serving as Scout Master<br>
2. The first battle will be faught during &quot;The Festival&quot; (8 days after Bertoxx is summoned to<br>
NK)<br>
3. The war will be faught over a long period of time (weeks perhaps), and will involve several<br>
fronts.<br>
4. All &quot;good&quot; cities on Antonica will be involved (Qeynos, Halas, Rivervale, Freeport, Kaladim,<br>
Felwithe/Kelethin, Ak'anon)<br>
5. Many Gods will be involved, including Rallos Zek, Tunare, Bertox, Innoruuk, and others.<br>
6. Zones will behave differently. Be VERY cautious what spells you may rely upon.<br>
7. Mobs that are normally level-restricted (Vox, Naggy) will not be for this event.<br>
8. There is a strong chance that both bridges and boats will be down for portions of the war.<br>
9. The safety zones will be Surefall Glade, Arena, Lower Kaladim, and Velious.<br>
10. Bertox will have an army of &quot;planar beings.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Planes of Karana<br>
<br>
1. Bertox will be summoned to NK<br>
2. Gate and teleportation spells will either (a) not work or (b) have a HIGH failure/fizzle rate.<br>
I'd be willing to bet this is spells cast IN The zones, not spells teleporting you TO the zones.<br>
3. Ressurection will only be possible within these zones via res stick<br>
<br>
Qeynos<br>
<br>
1. Generals for the defense of Qeynos include Shakar and Wamsutta.<br>
2. Trakanon and Bertox himself will be assaulting the city.<br>
3. Bertox will assault the city after the &quot;Festival&quot; mentioned above.<br>
4. Antonious Bayle will lead an army to confront Bertox in WK.<br>
5. Kane Bayle will show up with half the bloodsabre army in an effort to kill Antonious.<br>
6. If Kane and his army are killed, it will be discovered he in a imposter and the real Kane<br>
will appear in Qeynos along with enough Bloodsabres to take the city over.<br>
7. Blackburrow Gnolls will aid Bertox.<br>
8. Bertox is un-killable until he hits Qeynos Hills.<br>
<br>
Halas<br>
<br>
1. Expect a visit from Lady Vox.<br>
2. The Tribunal will close Halas during the war (what this means I dunnoe)<br>
<br>
Rivervale<br>
<br>
1. Expect a visit from Lord Nagafen.<br>
2. An undead army from Kithicor will assault Rivervale when Innoruuk appears in Freeport.<br>
3. The assault can only be stopped by killing the Necromancers in Kithicor who are raising the<br>
zombies.<br>
4. Legion of the Little Folk will be defending.<br>
<br>
Freeport<br>
<br>
1. A Teir'dal army will be assaulting the city from Nektulos.<br>
2. Innoruuk will attack the city armed with Lanys' Guardian Staff (more<br>
info?), a Dark Elf army, and the Militia will join him.<br>
3. Expect a visit from Lord Nagafen if he is not routed in Rivervale.<br>
<br>
Kaladim<br>
<br>
1. Lower Kaladim will be a safe zone.<br>
2. Will be assaulted by a level 15-30 Dark Elf army (with a few 50s thrown in)<br>
<br>
Kelethin/Felwithe/GFay<br>
<br>
1. The Ring of Scale will aid in defending this area. If you do NOT havegood Ring faction, it is<br>
suggested you get your butt into Mistmore NOW or avoid this area during the war.<br>
2. Claws of Veeshan will be assaulting this area (wyverns and drakes from CS, level 40-52).<br>
EVERYONE will be KOS to Claws in Gfay, regardless of your usual faction reading.<br>
3. Orcs (level 10-50) will be assaulting from Crushbone<br>
<br>
Cabilis<br>
<br>
1. The Combine Empire will re-awaken and try to level Cabilis <br>
<br>
============================================================<br>
<br>
Now given the server wide battle between Cazic Thule and Tunare in LFay(Fixed, I'm sure -<br>
did poor old Cazic really have a chance? Can't have Firiona/Tunare beat up, can we? ) It<br>
seems plausible that some of the above is true... (even if that event doesn't match the list<br>
above)<br>
Does anyone have any more information about these events, ideally with some idea of<br>
timings (I really want to be in for the Seige of Cabilis - not sure whether to play by Lizzy<br>
Monk or my Cabilis aligned inky Chanter)<br>
It sounds like the whole thing is going to be a blast and I want to take part.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

Pretty interesting little clip.  I can't verify that any of this is true, but its interesting at the least.    Lets try to keep up on these events.<br>
