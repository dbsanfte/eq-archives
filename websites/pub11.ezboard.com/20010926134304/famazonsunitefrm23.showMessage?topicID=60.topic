Alecto quirked a brow, a little irritated. &quot;What?&quot;<br>

Megaera narrowed her eyes. &quot;A new group of Deceased warlords have entered Tartarus. Celeste needs you there to evaluate them.&quot;<br>

Megaera smiled to Artemis as Alecto left.<br>
&quot;I thought you both needed a break from her. And you're right, she never changes.&quot;<br>
<br>
For some reason, Meg's smile was pleasant. Perhaps the time off from her duties has been profitable. She has as well been keeping herself busy in Aphrodite's Temples. Away from the other Olympians.<br>
<br>
&quot;Artemis, I heard of the misfortune in Themiscrya, I just wanted to let you know of my personal protection to the Amazons. I know the Furies tend to lean towards favor of the Scynthian sisters because of Alysia, but Hippolyte and the Themiscryans are Family to us all.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled and then turned to face Bellerophon.<br>
&quot;Greetings sir, who might you be?&quot; She kindly asked.<br>
Sadly, Alecto was the only Furie that really got out with the Olympians. Megaera stayed mostly to the mortals and the amazons where Tisiphone stayed to herself more than anything. <br>
