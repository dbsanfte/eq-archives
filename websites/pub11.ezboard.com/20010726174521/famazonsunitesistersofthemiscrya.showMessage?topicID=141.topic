Her pale ice blue eyes scanned the water's horizon.  She wore a black cloak, with a large heavy hood over her auburn hair that fell upon her shoulders.  She had left her crown behind upon her ivory throne on Mt. Olympus.  During this time of punishment, she had decided that she would punish herself physically.  As she was being emotionally by Zeus.  Already, she could feel the cold northern wind blowing over the Sea.  Being immortal, the cold did not affect her too much.  But, the time away from her place on Mt. Olympus would be as harsh as she could deal out for herself.  Her heart was already broken, because she knew her actions were about to bring great harm to the amazons of Themiscrya.  And even more, she feared that her granddaughter, Hippolyte, would never speak to her again.  She would stand here, and face anything that was thrown at Themiscrya.  The northern storms would hit this old cave temple first.  She would feel it first, before the amazons.  Hera had longed to help the amazons...but the look she feared in Hippolyte's eyes..kept her far away. <p>~~<<<<<<{{{{@</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://hometown.aol.com/queenhippolyte/spinningsword.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Vasilissa</span><br>  Posts: 219<br> <font color=#993300>(1/24/01 8:14:23 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/pleiade3/ehipp.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The hidden temple in the caves of the Black Sea</span><hr size=1> :::Hippolyte had packed up one of her horses for the journey to the coast of the Black Sea.  There was one place she had yet to check...that was close enough to travel...to find Hera.  She knew that Greece was too far away.  And would not be able to make that kind of treck, and return in time to prepare Themiscrya for the upcoming hard winter.  She urged the mare thru the forest trail that lead to the cave that very few new off.  A cave that held the ancient temple of Hera, from her days as the Goddess of the Underworld.  It was from a time, before Hera had become the wife of Zeus.  When she helped her brother, Hades rule the dead....long before she took the job as Goddess of Marriage and Childbirth.  Hera had shown this temple, to Hippolyte when she was rearing the child.  It had become their special place.  A place that they could get away from the troubles of Mt Olympus.  And just be "mother" and child.  Hippolyte smiled as she thought of those memories.  Then her breath released a soft sigh...and continued her journey:::  <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>
