  <br>
   I am not looking for some uber dropped item. I am interested in guild with friends that I can group with and have a good time with. At this time I don't feel that way here. I often feel more at home when grouping with friends from other guilds. <br>
<br>
  I am not looking for an Uber Guild but I will tell you what I am looking for.<br>
<br>
<br>
  I personally don't feel you, as a guild, are ready to recruit. Before you can add to a Guild you must create, define and establish one. <br>
<br>
 1) Create<br>
     Form a guild consisting of members that share a common ideal. <br>
      This was done long before any of us became members.<br>
<br>
 2) Define the Guild. <br>
     We should be inviting people into the guild because they share the same belief and goals, not because they happen to be looking for a guild to join. EVERYONE that joins should know the meaning of Benevolence and what it is...many don't.<br>
<br>
 3) Establish <br>
     Bring the guild up to a point where the guild is able to accomplish its own objectives and meet prospective members expectations. <br>
     A) Raids<br>
     In my opinion the guild is not ready to run raids. Doesn't matter how many dungeons we have been to individually or that you can walk all the way through a dungeon and back out unscathed. What is important is that you can bring others there, make it enjoyable to them, and bring them back out. To do this you will need two things; the people running it to be able to work together and set rules. <br>
         I) Guild Raid Leaders<br>
            These people will set objectives for the raid, set levels of who may attend, time and date, and looting rules. Exceptions only allowed with Guild Leaders approval.  These people will have grouped together at least once at this location previous to the raid.  <br>
         II) General Rules that are not raid specific<br>
              a) Anyone not agreeing to rules will not attend<br>
              b) Everyone that attends is eligible for rewards with the exception of certain items that were determined and announced prior to the raid intended for specific people.<br>
              c) If a raid death occurs while you are still there then you will be expected to stay long enough to help in any way possible with the recovery. I do not want to see the survivors of a bad pull leaving the CR to those who didn't. I want everyone to have the confidence that if they do die they will be aided in the CR not abandoned.<br>
<br>
     B) Questing and Powerleveling <br>
         It seems to be divided between the people that are always helping others and the people that are always asking for help with a few others that just spend time solo and rarely interface with anyone. That needs to change. Suggest you make everyone share responsibility.    One possibility <br>
          Levels 10 to 20 will be supported by levels 10 to 30<br>
          Levels 20 to 30 will be supported by levels 20 to 40<br>
          Levels 30 to 40 will be supported by levels 30 to 50<br>
          Levels 40 to 50 will be supported by levels 40 to 60<br>
          This makes everyone accept some responsibility and still be eligible for support from higher levels. <br>
<br>
      C) Spell Research<br>
          Assign a person to act as representive for each of the different Caster Classes that require Spell Research. This person should be the one with the highest Research skill for that class. All unused asscociated research components gathered for that class will be turned over to him/her. This will provide the guild with the greatest chance to successfully create the research spells which can then be given to the lower level members.<br>
     <br>
      D) Ports, Rezs<br>
      Need to establish rules/guidelines for these requests(demands). <br>
      Limit Guild Port requests with few exceptions to CR or Raid runs, not just because you don't want to wait for boat. <br>
      Set level limit for Rez requests. It will take a low level character less time to regain Exp than it will for a Cleric to come to corpse, Rez, regain mana and then return to what he/she was doing until that time.  <br>
<br>
     E) Items<br>
         Items considered of any value (if you consider it valuable enough to auction it then it meets the requirements)<br>
be offered to sell to guild members before auctioning outside. Yes, you may not get as good a price for selling it but hopefully this will be balanced by not having to pay as much later for something you want from another guild member. <br>
 <br>
     F) General<br>
         A single, well organized raid is better than four poorly planned ones. Start with only one raid a month and go from there.<br>
         Set 1 day of the month for Trade/Language skills. Would much rather spend 1 day making making many items or helping with trade skills rather than many several nights making a single item each time often spending hours just trying to meet up with the requester and/or gather materials.<br>
         <br>
         Start spending time with other guild members close to your level. I always see the same people in the same groups. <br>
<br>
4) Recruiting  <br>
   Benevolent Order has become a guild with one purpose...<br>
to finance, support and train low level characters until such time as they become self-sufficient and high enough level to be accepted into another guild. <br>
   Need to understand that if you are to accept lower levels into guild then you need to have both the time and resources to support them. At lower levels characters are resource hogs not an asset. The more experienced members of the guild will constantly be asked for items, help leveling, money, help questing, ports, Rez, buffs and more. If you are not prepared to support that and allocate time and resources to it then they will leave. The  only thing that you will have gained is a bad reputation as a guild.   <br>
   At around level 29 all this changes. At level 29 your Porters can now port others, your Clerics can Rez and you Chanters have Clarity. You will need all 3 of these if you want guild to survive. At this level every other guild will be doing their best to recruit them. Unless you have something better to offer then all the time and money you put into raising them all went into support for another guild. Your resource hogs just became some other guilds assets. <br>
  At higher levels those classes are no longer wanted in a guild, they are expected. Past level 40 people will expect Guild to have a CLeric that can Rez, a porter that can help with CR and a Chanter that can help on raids. <br>
  Using my own money and time I personally made 4 complete sets of FS armor accompanied with GrandMaster Jeweler made jewelry and gave to Clerics for free in the hope of raising a high level Cleric in the guild. By level 30 they and at least 2 others had all left guild. <br>
<br>
  Just something for you all to think about. I myself will take a short sabbitical and try and bring Cleric up. Will still be around if anyone needs. Not expecting the guild to change on my behalf or to suit my wants. These are just what I will be looking for in a guild I want to be a part of. <br>
