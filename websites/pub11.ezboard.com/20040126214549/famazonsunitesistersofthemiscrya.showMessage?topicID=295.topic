She sat there in full armour, her crow mask over her face. Her eyes narrowed as she spotted Cricket return to Themiscya. She ouldnt believe the one who had hurt her beloved Tasha in the matter she did had the odasity to return. Tasha might have not been her daughter, but, she is Terrayus's, and Vel hadmore love for all the children of her love then one might expect from the sociopathic amazon. She watchd her fall from the horse, but stayed where she was. This so called amazon was the last person she would help at this moment, this girl, who had left her stepdaughter and child.Oh no, Velaska was not going to allow this one to harm her stepdaughter again. A sharp eye was going to be kept on this one*<br>

She slowly picked herself up off the ground and reached up taking the reigns of her horse and stumbly walked down the rest of the village to her old hut.  Her body so battered and beaten she could hardly even keep conciousness so she slipped in between the old hut she stayed in and another and plopped down into the grassy area between them so as she could rest her withered body without someone fussing.

I can stitch you up, but am going to have to cleanse the wound, and that might sting a bit. Just dont need a wound like that to become infected.<br>

~She brought a clear bottle of liquid from the box nd a clean cloth she placed them both down on the table, then she took out a box of matches, lit the wick, a long needle and thread.~<br>

The liquid will sterilize the wound, it's pretty deep and has alot of choise area for germs living condtions..But it hurts..alot...<br>

Wow, I'm glad I did that when I did. All of that that's comming out are germs..<br>
~she began to wipe it up with a dry cloth. When done with that, DeL picked up the needle and held it in the fire for a fewmoments to kill any germs that might be on it, then she threaded it and lookd up to Cricket.~<br>

I'll have you fixed in a moment.<br>
~with that she pierced her flesh with the needle quickly and began to sew up the wound expertly.~  <p>         ~~* DeL *~~

Pain is only weakness leaving the body. Soe warlord taught me that long, long ago...before I slaughtered his family and him. ~ she bandaged up the wound with a clean cloth and tied it around her tightly. Then she handed Cricket a bundle of the cloth.~ Make sure you clean the bandage every day, also, make sre you clean the wound. If it starts to turn red and a bad smell comes from it, look for me. I'll hve to reclean it. It will mean that it got infected anyway.<br>
