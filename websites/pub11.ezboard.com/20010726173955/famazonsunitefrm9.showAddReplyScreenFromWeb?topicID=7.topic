They include: <br>
<br>
Aedon/Aedon 'nightingale' <br>
Aete 'mighty' or 'eagle' <br>
Alkidike 'mighty justice' <br>
Alkithoe 'impetuous might' <br>
Anippe 'queenly mare' <br>
Archippe 'dominant mare' <br>
Atanea 'of the opposition' <br>
Athtar, named for the Arab Sun Goddess <br>
Ktesippe 'possessor of horses' <br>
Oigme <br>
Tereis 'piercer' <br>
Zerynthia (Scythian Amazon) <br>
<br>
Besides those who were obviously mortal, several women listed here are called daughters of Great Goddesses. They probably represent deified ancestresses or high priestesses who were once considered literal physical embodiments of the Goddesses they served. <br>
<br>
AGANIPPE 'mare who kills mercifully' <br>
A warrior and priestess of Artemis as Divine Hunter of Souls. <br>
<br>
AGAMEDE 'very cunning' <br>
Founder of a city named for herself on the Amazon colony of Lesbos. <br>
<br>
AGAVE 'high born' <br>
The exposure of newborn girls happened with appalling frequency in ancient Greek society, leading to the <br>
establishment of numerous 'Parthenian Hills,' places to leave such unfortunate children. In response, the <br>
movements of the many sacred hunters of Artemis and rangers of Athena began to cross these <br>
hills on a regular basis. It was on one such trip that Agave was found. She was named for her rich wrappings, which had been defaced to make her clan markings unreadable. <br>
<br>
AKANTHA 'bright flower' or 'burning sun' <br>
Amazon, priestess of Athena. <br>
<br>
ALKIPPE 'might of horses' <br>
She chose to remain celibate, channeling her energies as far as possible into her war skills and shamanism. <br>
Alkippe became a respected trainer and advisor, as well as an esteemed warrior. <br>
<br>
ALKYONE 'queen who keeps away (storms)' <br>
Daughter of Archippe. She was named for a war and sea aspect of Aphrodite, better known as the sister of <br>
Taygete the Pleiade. <br>
<br>
ALEXIARES 'warding off war' <br>
Amazon warrior and granddaughter of Hera. Like her grandmother, she commanded the winds. <br>
<br>
ANYMONE 'defender who is without fault' <br>
One Amazon by this name fought for Orithia. The other was a great heroine of the Libyan Amazons, who drew water from a rock in the desert, saving her tribe. <br>
<br>
ANAEA 'raising up' <br>
She added considerably to the territory of the Thermodontine Amazons, establishing a city named for herself in Karia opposite Hera's holy city of Samos. Her tomb there, like Orithia's at Megaera, Myrene's near Troy, and Antiope's in Athens was a great pilgrimage site until Classical times. She was named for a Goddess associated with Artemis. <br>
<br>
ANAXILEA 'queenly lion' <br>
An Amazon whose shield was emblazoned with a white bird, symbolizing Athena. <br>
<br>
ANDRODAMEIA 'man fighter' <br>
A queen of the Thermodontine Amazons who defeated one of the leading Greek generals in single combat <br>
during the Third Doric Raid. Another Androdameia participated in the Attic War. <br>
<br>
ANDROMACHE 'man fighter' <br>
One of the greatest of all the queens of the Thermodontine Amazons. Known for her bravery, she was <br>
consistently victorious in battle. Ruling with Glauke 'owl,' and Iphito 'shield strength' whom she also fought <br>
with side by side, her most famous conflict was with a horde of Greek pirates. The battle was later known as the First Doric Raid. <br>
Andromache successfully united the Thermodontine and Libyan Amazons against the invaders, resulting in a <br>
Libyan blockade that prevented the arrival of Greek reinforcements. At the height of the battle, she fought with her hair unbound, insuring that she remained a clear rallying point for her forces, <br>
and that no false claims could be made that she had died. <br>
The council during her reign included: <br>
Ainippe 'swift horse' <br>
Alkaia 'mighty one' Taurian, wore cap with bull ears and tail <br>
Alkinoe 'mighty in wisdom' daughter of Nikippe <br>
Anaximache 'queenly warrior' Phrygian immigrant <br>
Andromeda 'ruler of men' <br>
Antimache 'opposing warrior' <br>
Areximache 'excellent warrior' <br>
Barkida 'grievous in wrath' <br>
Kydoime 'glorious one' <br>
Lykopis 'she wolf' <br>
Okypous 'swift footed' <br>
Pisto 'trustworthy' <br>
Scyleia 'leaper' <br>
Telepyleia 'far sailing' <br>
Tesipyle 'swift sailor' <br>
Thraso 'confidence' had a gorgoneum on her shield, fought with her lover <br>
Hypsipyle 'of the high gate' <br>
Toxaris 'archer' <br>
Toxophile 'poisoned arrow' <br>
<br>
ANTIANARA/ANTIANEIRA 'against the sea' <br>
This warrior of the Attic War so impressed her Greek enemies that Homer used her name as an adjective for any Amazon. The name became common among Amazon queens, including the successor of Penthesilea. <br>
<br>
ANTILEON 'bold as a lion' <br>
An immigrant from Egypt, she fought with Androdameia during the Third Doric Raid. <br>
<br>
ANTIOCHE 'confronting the city' <br>
Founder of the Pisidian city in Asia Minor, and its Phrygian twin. Both regions were Amazon territory at the <br>
time. A second Antioche was a leader in the Amazon tribe known as the Centaurs. <br>
<br>
ANTIOPE 'confronting Moon' <br>
The history of this Amazon queen is confused by propaganda and the fact that she shares her name with a <br>
warrior Goddess of Thebes. Antiope of Thebes was the second aspect of a triad of warrior Moon Goddesses. <br>
She descended to the underworld at the New Moon, attended by the crone figure Dirke 'cleft.' Each time the Moon reappeared after these few nights of darkness, Thebes rejoiced, and a bull, symbol of rebirth, was <br>
sacrificed and feasted on. It is from the ceremony of tossing a round cake representing the Full Moon onto the bull's horns that the gruesome tale of Dirke's death comes. <br>
The queen of Thebes was the embodiment of Antiope on earth, her older advisor the embodiment of Dirke. <br>
Occasionally their disagreements may have been severe enough to demand a ritual combat, or, more likely, the ceremonial combat was performed on the night of the first rising of the Waxing Moon. Dirke 'lost' each month, and the loss was well remembered. So much for Thebes. <br>
The name Antiope was popular among the Amazons, for it was carried by a queen, a princess, and an archer who gained fame in the Attic War. Queen Antiope's capture and removal to Athens by Greek pirates helped <br>
instigate that war, which included a massive slave revolt. Her death at the hand of Molpadia was not for <br>
treachery, but to save her from rape by the Athenian king. <br>
<br>
APOLLONIA 'destroyer' or 'apple keeper' <br>
An Amazon queen better known as Cyrene, ancestress of the Thrakian tribe of the Milesians, who continued to be matrilinear into Classical times. A city on the shores of the Black Sea was called by this name. <br>
<br>
APRIATE 'without rancour' <br>
Great heroine of Lesbos, named for a Sea Goddess. <br>
<br>
ARETO 'unspeakable' or 'virtuous rule' <br>
A member of the troupe led by Pantariste which dislodged the Greek pirates from the beach during the Second Doric Raid. Named for a Goddess of justice, she wore a snake insignia. She was also mother of Nausicaa, while the Goddess was a reputed teacher of Heraklaea. <br>
<br>
ARSIPPE 'rearing horse' also called Aristippe 'best of horses' <br>
Associated with bats, this Goddess was worshipped by some Scythian Amazons. One of her priestesses was <br>
driven from Orchomenos by priests of Dionysus, who often violently deposed the servants of ecstatic Moon <br>
and Night Goddesses with their mad god. <br>
<br>
ASTRONOE 'high minded one,' or 'one who knows the stars' <br>
Priestess of Artemis, named for a Phoenician Goddess similar in nature to Cybele. <br>
<br>
AUTOCHTHE 'created by oneself' <br>
Daughter of Andromeda. <br>
<br>
BARKIDA 'grievous in wrath' <br>
Member of the city guard during the reign of Hippolyte. <br>
<br>
BEREKYNTHIA/BEREKUNTHIA 'running Goddess of the mountains' or 'bringer of wisdom' <br>
Amazon queen. <br>
<br>
CAMILLA 'little comb,' fiery one,' 'drinking vessel' <br>
Great ancestress of the Volscians of ancient Latium, an Amazon queen who was suckled by a mare and grew into a great hunter and runner. Fighting bare breasted and loose haired in the grand tradition of successful Amazon leaders, her honour guard included Larina, Tulla, Tarpeia, and Opis (all named for demoted Goddesses). She led the fight against the invaders led by Aeneas. <br>
<br>
CELAENO 'obscurity' or 'screamer' <br>
She, Eurybia 'wide ranging force' and Phoebe 'bright Moon' hunted and fought together. As hunters they were <br>
always successful, while in battle they formed a deadly wedge of spears. <br>
<br>
CHALCIOPE/CHALAIOPE 'brazen face' <br>
Leader of part of the force that drove off the Greek pirates of the Second Doric Raid. <br>
<br>
CHRYSIPPE 'golden horse' <br>
An Amazon warrior whose daughter was one of the first famous Helens, and herself a warrior. Chrysippe's <br>
daughter was later confused with Helen of Sparta. <br>
<br>
CYRENE 'sovereign mistress of the bridle,' 'she of the hair or ax' <br>
Named for a sun Goddess, she founded the Libyan Amazon tribe later known as the Sirens, who lived in a city named for her on the North African coast. She had three sisters, Alkaia 'mighty one,' Themisto 'the oracular,' and Astygeneia 'bearer of queens.' An expert with the sword and javelin, she frightened away potential invaders by inviting them to watch her wrestle wild lions. Her consort Xantho 'yellow' was almost as famous for her skills in hunting as her connections with the fierce Amazon queen. <br>
Cyrene's people in general were as known for their exports of the herb silphium and red leather as for piracy. Like many coastal peoples, they were shrewd, prosperous traders, willing to salvage any wrecks that washed up on their shores. Their continued practice of the old Goddess centred religion shows in their later portrayals, sometimes as mermaids singing enchantments. They were prophets who could read the past and look into the future. Other times they were bird bodied, heads, necks, and breasts showing in a way that makes them difficult to tell from Harpies. Usually there were two or three of them, representing the Death Goddess in her light and dark or Triple Goddess aspect. When the Sirens were threefold, they made up a musical trio of flute, lyre, and voice, which may have been a typical arrangement for sacred music. <br>
A second Siren colony was located on a Mediterranean island in Classical times, matching accounts of former Amazon Nation members in the area. Several sets of Sirens were known to Classical storytellers. <br>
<br>
Daughters of the Muses Melpomene or Terpsichore: <br>
Teles 'perfect' or Peisinoe 'seductress' <br>
Raedne 'shining' Aglaope 'glorious face' <br>
Molpe 'melody' Thelxiopeia 'perfect face' <br>
Thelxiope 'perfect face' <br>
<br>
Italian Sirens: <br>
Leukosia 'white Goddess' or Himeropa 'awakening face' <br>
Ligeia 'high voiced' Thelchetereia 'enchanter' <br>
Aglaope 'glorious face' <br>
Peisinoe 'seductress' <br>
Parthenope 'virgin face' <br>
Aglaophonos/Aglaopheme 'beautiful voice' or 'beautiful speech' <br>
<br>
The sun Goddess Cyrene was said to have a crystal palace beneath the sea, where she was attended by archer nymphs. <br>
<br>
DORIS 'bountiful' <br>
Named for the Great Goddess of the Dorians, which suggests that she was an immigrant. She was a spear <br>
wielder in the Attic War. <br>
<br>
EGEE <br>
A Libyan Amazon queen who led an army through Libya and Asia Minor to fight at Troy. After killing the city's king, she and her army returned home. The incident seems to be the first of many battles brought about by repeated attempts at take over by patriarchal forces. Since she didn't stay or leave a garrison, the priestess-queen of the city may have called upon Amazon aid as Hekuba would later. Since all Goddess centred cultures were coming under siege at this time, and the Amazon Nation was itself a confederation which Troy probably belonged to, it is no surprise that the Amazons would provide assistance when called upon. <br>
<br>
EUMACHE 'good fighter' <br>
This warrior of the Attic War fought with a stone after using up her arrows, an act weirdly reminiscent of the Greek tale of Herakles fighting over the stolen cattle of Geryon. <br>
<br>
HIPPO 'horse' <br>
Queen of Amazonia with Marpesia 'the snatcher,' and Lampedo 'burning torch.' Her sister Molpia 'melody' was a priestess of Hanged Artemis. Hippo and her fellow queens moved across Asia Minor to the Aegean Sea, where they founded Ephesus, Smyrna, and Myrine. They were met by a hostile Trojan army (suggesting the city had left the Nation for a time), which they defeated, signing a treaty with the city. It is their establishment of Ephesus that is most well known, where they set up a shrine to Artemis in the forest beneath a beech tree. The tree was a sign from Artemis, since beech trees do not typically grow so far south. <br>
<br>
HIPPOLYTE 'of the stampeding horses' or 'she who releases the horses' <br>
The dynastic title of a series of Thermodontine queens. The one usually remembered for her belt was daughter of Otrere, and her real name was Neptunis. Hippolyte's birth name suggests that she was a priestess of Artemis, since it was one of the Goddess' titles. The belt sent to Admete, a priestess of Hera at Argos was a good will gesture. (Clarification on this point is in Part Two.) <br>
Dorian pirates coveted what they perceived as Amazon riches and despised their personal freedom. The <br>
queen's belt was considered a representation of her personal sovereignty and her role as queen of the <br>
Amazons. The Second Doric Raid was carried out with the purpose of rape and pillage, with the belt taken as proof of victory. The raid failed, although Hippolyte was killed. The Dorians so feared her ghost that they built a heraeum for her at Megaera, and made expiatory pilgrimages to it until Classical times. Later propagandists rewrote the story and claimed that their new hero Herakles had stolen it, a task given to him as part of his penance for murdering his family. A curious idea, since in the same tales say that <br>
Herakles was driven mad by Hera, and killed his family in his frenzy, which suggests that some writers had <br>
attempted to exonerate him entirely. <br>
The belt 'stolen' by Herakles then becomes lost to mythology, although the belt sent by Hippolyta was long <br>
displayed in the Argive temple of Hera, its story suitably altered by the priests who had forcibly taken it over. <br>
The honour guard of Hippolyta's reign included: <br>
Aello 'whirlwind' castellan of Themiskyra <br>
Ainippe 'swift horse' <br>
Alkippe 'strength of horses' <br>
Asteria 'of the starry sky' <br>
Deianeira 'stringer together of spoils' <br>
Erioboea 'rich in cattle' <br>
Marpe 'snatcher' <br>
Phillipis 'lover of horses' <br>
Prothoe 'first in might' <br>
Tekmessa 'she who ordains' Phrygian immigrant <br>
<br>
HIPPOTHOE 'nimble horse' <br>
Fought with Penthesilea at Troy, she survived to found an Amazon colony on one of the Echinade islands. <br>
<br>
HYPSIPYLE 'of the high gate' <br>
Her name refers to the meridian, the Moon at its highest point in the sky. An Amazon warrior of this name <br>
fought with Pantariste. Another was a member of the Lemnian high council. She was captured by Thrakian <br>
pirates during a sea battle, and after her escape became high priestess of Artemis at the Nemean Grove. <br>
<br>
KLEITE/KLETA 'famous,' 'the invoked,' 'the renowned' <br>
The first Kleite was queen of Kyzicus, a prophet who was assisted by her sister Arisbe. The second was the <br>
mother of Penthesilea. Blown off course on the way to Troy, she arrived only to find the city razed, her daughter <br>
killed by treachery. She and her compliment of Amazons then set sail again for the Southern Coast of Italy, <br>
where they founded a city called by her name. The tribe came to be known as the Kleitae. <br>
<br>
KLEODAEIS 'famous warrior' <br>
Helped defend the colony of Lemnos from Greek pirates. <br>
<br>
KLITO 'the invoked' <br>
Priestess of Athena, daughter of Leukippe, who lived on the sacred island at the centre of the Libyan homeland <br>
of Tritonis. <br>
<br>
KLYMENE 'famous might' <br>
Daughter of the sea Goddess Tethys and participant in the Attic War. <br>
<br>
KYME 'wave' <br>
She, Priene 'queen who cuts,' and Pitana 'pine mother' helped lead the evacuation from the devastated Gorgon <br>
island of Tritonia. Their leader was Mitylene 'hornless Moon,' sister of one of the famous Myrines. The <br>
continued movement of the Gorgons was forced by their numbers and tensions with their mainland sisters. <br>
The Gorgon resettlement was not completely peaceful, due to the understandable alarm of tribes that had <br>
experienced the sudden arrival of patriarchal tribes, and the increased war activity of the new ly united Egyptian <br>
state, which had already forced a Libyan migration. <br>
Kyme and her sister 'generals' founded cities named for themselves, and coins from the city of Kyme still exist, <br>
clearly stamped with her image. She may also have been the ancestress of the Kimmeroi, a people who lived <br>
around Palus Maeotis, a onetime stronghold of both the Libyan and Thermodontine <br>
Amazons. That they were Amazons becomes clear from how they were mythologized, as a race that lived in <br>
perpetual darkness. That is, they refused to worship the Greek sun god Apollo or his later replacement, <br>
Herakles. Similar descriptions of alien peoples were once commonly used by Christian missionaries, who <br>
referred to them as 'living beyond the light of the Lord.' <br>
<br>
LAMPEDO 'burning torch' <br>
One of the generals who helped establish Ephesus. Her name refers to the traditional New Moon torchlit <br>
processions in honour of Artemis. <br>
<br>
LYSIPPE 'she who lets loose the horses' <br>
Initially ruler of territory North of the Black Sea, after a natural disaster she moved her people to the Thermodon plain. She is also considered founder of the worship of Artemis Tauropolos. Devastated when her son committed suicide, she turned her energies to consolidating and expanding the Amazon Nation. <br>
Lysippe built Themiskyra 'divine Themis' and its great temple of Themis-Artemis, and recodified Northern <br>
Amazon law. Also an ingenious strategist and general, she led the first cavalry unit. Her strategy and judgment of character were so sound that Marpesia and her other generals completed it successfully after her death. <br>
<br>
MARPESIA 'the snatcher' <br>
Ruler with Hippo 'horse,' and Lampedo 'burning torch' after the death of Lysippe, she founded a great city in the Kaukasus Mountains near the Caspian Gate, by what was called the Marpesian Cliff. She helped extend <br>
Amazon influence to Europe, Asia, Thrake, Syria, and greater Asia Minor. She was succeeded by her daughter Synope after Marpesia was killed in battle with Asian invaders. <br>
<br>
MELANIPPE 'black horse' <br>
Sister of Hippolyte, she was captured during the Second Doric Raid. She led a successful mutiny to free herself and her fellow captives. They landed at Scythia where many of the other captives stayed to found a new city, while she returned to participate in the Attic War. <br>
<br>
MOLPADIA 'death song' <br>
A participant in the Attic War, she saw her queen Antiope fall, injured so seriously she could not defend <br>
herself from Theseus and his retainers. She killed the queen with an arrow, saving her from violation by the <br>
Athenian king. <br>
<br>
MYRINE 'swiftly bounding' <br>
The deeds attributed to Myrine are truly of mythic proportions. Queen of the North African Gorgons, she <br>
succeeded in raising an army of 33 000, 30 000 of which was cavalry, and conquer a stupendous amount of <br>
territory, including Atlantis. Depending who is writing, she was a kind conqueror, or an incredibly vicious one, <br>
acting more like a butcher than an Amazon. Her story was still in the process of revision when these versions were written down. Considering how difficult it was for most early cities to reach 10 000 people, even assuming Myrine collected vast numbers of allies or conscripts, the numbers seem too large. The story reads like a telescoped, confused explanation of how the Amazon Nation came to be so vast. The Nation was of considerable size, but what the Greeks knew of it was created and administered mainly in a time when societal norms were changing. Information on it derives mainly from biased sources, who considered large groups of allied people impossible without warfare. Considering the Northern Amazon Nation existed as a political power for over 400 years and only ceased to be one after two centuries of concerted pressure from patriarchal forces, and the inability of war based empires to last even 100 years, fighting has too strong a role in these stories. <br>
Some of the first African Amazon tribes lived on an island off the vast Northern coast of the continent, <br>
alternately called Tritonia or Hespera by later authors. The island was probably called Tritonia, giving the inland sea Lake Tritonis its name later. Others lived in a territory including the vast Atlas mountain range. <br>
Unfortunately for the island Amazons who worshipped the Moon and Sea Goddess Sipylene 'the Mother,' <br>
Tritonia was a volcanic island. In a cataclysm that would be repeated at Thera near Crete, the island was <br>
destroyed, leaving behind only the present day Canary Islands. <br>
The Tritonians were driven to the mainland. However, life was difficult in and around the Atlas Mountains. The Sun beat down mercilessly, and it was necessary to contend with the desert. The sea-loving Tritonians soon came into conflict with the Gorgons, worshippers of Athena the Sun Goddess. Such a huge number of refugees of a different culture although similar philosophy could not be absorbed easily. <br>
After some fighting, the first Myrine led her people further east, to the region around Lake Tritonis. The name 'Myrine' became a title taken by each queen in honour of her role in resettling her people and repairing relations with the Gorgons. Her efforts on the latter were so successful that the two tribes eventually united, much to the confusion of outsiders later, resulting in the garbled tale of the invasion of Atlantis. <br>
The next Myrine of great influence had to deal directly with the united Egypt. Its armies forced a Libyan <br>
migration which led to conflict between the Amazons and the fleeing tribes. Myrine was more than successful, turning her army from defense to offense and taking control of Syria, Egypt, Phrygia, and other Mediterranean lands. After some years holding that territory, renewed fighting forced them to withdraw from most of it, except Phrygia and some small areas around the Mediterranean. The resurgence of unified Egypt forced a Libyan migration, resulting in Amazons and other tribes sailing on to Crete and Cyprus. It became clear that taking over other nations was not a successful tactic for increasing the Amazon Nation or maintaining it. <br>
Unlike most nations, since the Amazon Nation consisted solely of women, any strategy that ended numerous <br>
lives to no purpose had to be abandoned by necessity, even without the difference in mindset between <br>
Goddess worshipping and god worshipping cultures. So by philosophy and practicality, a conquistadora strategy never became enshrined in Amazon culture. The Myrine who helped found Ephesus was a great warrior and general, but more importantly she was an excellent diplomat. Her numerous 'foot and <br>
cavalry' were not raised solely from Libyan Amazonia, if such numbers could have been raised. Rather than <br>
going out to conquer, she sent out numerous riders and messengers to search out like minded tribes of women, with overtures to confederation. The tactic was enormously successful. By the end of it, the Taurian Sea, the Black Sea, and the Caucus river formed the boundaries of the Amazon Nation in Europe and Asia Minor. Numerous Goddess worshipping tribes that were not Amazon became allies in order to gain support against the growing numbers of hostile patriarchal tribes coming from the North. Myrine went on to found a city in Aeolis named for herself, and Smyrna in Lydia, also named for herself. <br>
During one of her many sea journeys she was caught in a storm. She sacrificed to Sipylene, long considered a protector of sailors caught on rough seas, and made it to shore. Myrine died fighting Scythian and Thrakian tribes that felt threatened by the increased power of the Amazons. Her tomb, called Bateia 'thorn hill' was near Troy, a later barometer for the strength of patriarchal forces. The next Myrine, daughter of Orithia, was forced to fight followers of 'Dionysus' for control of Ephesus. Besides being an important crossroads, it was of such religious importance that control of it was considered a source of Amazon strength. Myrine's army was fronted by her Gorgons in snakeskin armour, armed with bows which they drew past their chests and could fire rapidly from horses at full gallop. Gathering allies as she moved North, a huge army with a significant mounted component attacked the Greek stronghold of Olympus. Succeeding in breaking its power at least temporarily, memory of this army remained, multiplying in numbers and ferocity as time passed. Much of this army, like others before it, consisted of women past childbearing age. Later encounters with increasing numbers of Greek soldiers forced younger women to fight on a regular basis, leading to the eventual tales of the beautiful Gorgons, protected by their crone sisters, the Graea. <br>
Later the Thermodontine Amazons reunited the numerous tribes and cities of women who worshipped mainly <br>
Athena, Artemis, and Cybele, and recreated alliances with other Goddess-worshipping tribes. Artemis was the main embodiment of feminine power in the Northern areas of the Amazon Nation, and never ceased to be associated with it. Athena suffered cruel transformations at the hands of the newly powerful Greek warlords, who made her white and a cruel foe to women. <br>
<br>
MITYLENE 'hornless Moon' <br>
Sister of the second famous Myrine who helped her settle Lesbos. Myrine named the colony's capital after her in gratitude for her assistance. <br>
<br>
MYRTO 'Sea Goddess' <br>
Named for Aphrodite as a stormy, warlike Sea Goddess, this Amazon warrior was mother of Autolycus, who <br>
was later conveniently stripped of his Amazon associations. <br>
<br>
ORITHIA 'woman raging in the mountains' <br>
Daughter of Marpesia, she led the Attic War to free her fellow Amazon queen Antiope and avenge the death of queen Hippolyte. Learning that a significant number of Scythian and Thrakian slaves were in Athens, with a portion of the former kept as a personal guard for the Athenian king, Orithia saw a great <br>
opportunity. Gathering her Scythian and Thrakian allies, she sent two sets of diplomatic envoys. One to ensure Lakonia did not assist Athens, which was no great problem, and a more subtle group to contact Scythian and Thrakian slave leaders to see what the odds were of gaining their assistance in return for freedom. In a feat more impressive than Hannibal's, Orithia led her army across the Kimmerian Bosporus, over the Danube, then through Thrake, Thessaly, and Boeotia. Then she besieged Athens, which collapsed between her army and the slave revolt it suffered within. <br>
Orithia had no intentions of staying, however. After completing a treaty with the chastened Athenians and <br>
building a tomb for Antiope, she and her army left, taking a considerable number of newly freed slaves with <br>
them. Unfortunately, Orithia had suffered serious injuries, and succumbed to infection on the way home. Her fate was shared by other Amazons, who were buried along the army's route home. <br>
<br>
Among the Amazons who participated in the Attic War, a few have had their names recorded. <br>
<br>
Amynome 'blameless defender' <br>
Androdameia 'tamer of men' <br>
Antianara 'against the sea' <br>
Antimache 'warrior of the opposition' <br>
Antiope 'confronting Moon' (not the queen) archer <br>
Aristomache 'best of warriors' <br>
Charope 'brilliant confrontation' <br>
Deinomache 'terrible warrior' <br>
Dolope 'snare' <br>
Doris 'bountiful' spearwielder <br>
Echephyle 'chief defender' wicker shield <br>
Eumache 'good warrior' <br>
Euryleia 'wide wandering' <br>
Hippomache 'horse warrior' <br>
Kleoptoleme 'famous warrior' <br>
Klymene 'famous might' <br>
Kreousa 'golden' <br>
Laodoke 'good for the people' <br>
Melousa 'gentle one' <br>
Mimnousa 'strong one' <br>
Molpadia 'death song' <br>

<br>
OTRERE 'the nimble' <br>
Builder of the great temple of Artemis and its attendant bird sanctuary on Aretias, an island on the Black Sea. She was deified after her death. <br>
<br>
PANTARISTE 'best of all' <br>
Scythian Amazon who led an attack on Greek pirate captains during the Second Doric Raid. She pursued two <br>
Greeks going to warn their compatriots armed with her spear and shield, which was emblazoned with a white <br>
sphinx. Throwing her spear at one Greek so hard that she pinned him to the ground and couldn't get it loose, she killed the other with her bare hands. <br>

Daughter of Kleite or Orithia, ruler of the Thermodontine Amazons with her sister Hippolyta and Antianeira, who eventually succeeded her. She had Thrakian roots, and this along with a call for help from the besieged queen of Troy led her to lead a small force to the city's aid. <br>
The Amazons temporarily freed the city, and Penthesilea killed Achilles, leader of the Myrmidonian Greeks. Contrary to some claims, he was not brought back to life again. He was named for a mythological figure representing the half of the year when the Sun waxes, while Agamemnon fills in for the waning Sun. They dueled in order to show off their skills to the Moon Goddess Briseis. Of course she chose the waxing Sun at Winter Solstice and the waning Sun at Summer Solstice. The tale was grafted into the story of the fall of Troy. <br>
In any case, the next battle led to Troy's defeat. Penthesilea was killed by treachery, stabbed in the back by one of the infamous priests of Apollo who had betrayed the city. Again contrary to popular belief, Penthesilea was not part of last flair of greatness from a dying Nation. Homeric Troy fell around 1200 BCE, a full six centuries before the official political demise of the Northern Amazon Nation. What she probably does represent is the beginning of the retreat of Goddess worshipping peoples in Asia Minor in the face of continuing violence from invaders. <br>
<br>
Penthesilea's elite group: <br>
Alkibia 'force of might' <br>
Andro 'manly' in final battle <br>
Antandre 'preceding man' <br>
Antibrote 'gory opposition' <br>
Bremusa 'invoker of the Muses' in final battle <br>
Derimachea 'wearing leather armour' <br>
Evadne 'blooming' <br>
Harmothoe 'sharp nail' <br>
Hippothoe 'impetuous horse' <br>
Klonie 'young shoot' <br>
Polemusa 'rich in the Muses' Gifts' <br>
Thermodosa 'heated one' <br>
  <br>
Other leaders: <br>
Derinoe 'tough minded' <br>
Aina 'swiftness' <br>
Androdaira/Androdaixa 'subduer of men' <br>
<br>
PLEIADES 'sailing ones' or 'flock of doves' <br>
The usual seven Pleiades are in fact daughters of Aphrodite as Dove Goddess, with only Taygete recognized as an Amazon. The Amazon Pleiades were daughters of an Amazon queen. They created choral dances and night festivals in honour of Artemis. <br>
<br>
Glaukia 'grey green' <br>
Kokkymo 'curling wave' <br>
Lampedo 'torch' <br>
Maia 'grandmother' <br>
Parthenia 'maiden' <br>
Protis 'first' <br>
Stonychia 'barb, sharp point' <br>
<br>
SYNOPE/SINOPE 'Moon face' <br>
Daughter of Marpesia, founded a city named for herself on the shores of the Black Sea. She drove off Greek invaders so successfully they maligned her for being warlike. They later mythologized her as an Amazon queen so desirable, the gods offered her anything she wanted in hopes of demanding her body in payment. Shrewd as her mother before her, Synope forced each god to swear by his own testicles to leave her alone. <br>
<br>
THESEIS 'she who lays down' <br>
What she lays down is the law, suggesting the name may have been a title of Themis the Lawgiver originally. The name belongs to an obscure Amazon, sometimes claimed to be Antiope, but this is a late revision. <br>
