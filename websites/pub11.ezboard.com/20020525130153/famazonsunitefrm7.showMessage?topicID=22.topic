What was a child of the forest ready to have to wear except the skins of a few of her kills, knitted messily together covering her vital areas.<br><br>She came upon a structure, a large wooden one, with bright lights burning inside, and the voices of women, happily enjoying the company of each other. Picking on a few of the males who ventured into the wrong territory that night.<br><br>The young girl watched with amazement through an open window, watching carefully the one who seemed to be incharge, the lovely auburn haired women, who didnt tower in hight, but you know she towered in strength and power.<br><br>The young girl made a decision, one that had changed her life for the better. She climbed through the window. For, she didnt know what a door was, she never saw one before. Once inside, she had a better veiw of the women. They wore cloths, somewhat similar to the males she had killed previously, but they showed more skin. The young girl felt very awkward for a moment, there they were looking all tidy and clean, and there she was, her brown hair tosseled with dirt and leaves, a few sticks stuck within the nestlike hair. Dirt and dried blood in patches on her skin from that nights hunt and kill. Time seemed to stop as one by one, they looked to the wild girl. She wanted to leave, to run out quickly, but it was as if she were frozen. Then suddenly, the first one she had noticed, had walked over to her. She told her her name was Hippolyte, and she was the Queen of the Amazons in Themiscrya. <br>The young girl had no clue as to what she was talking about, and that showed on her face, Hippolyte, then explained to her what an amazon was, and what they stood for. The young girl liked it. But when the Queen asked her her name, she didnt know what to say, for she never had a name, she hardly knew of her mother, she knew he rmother was killed infront of her eyes as she hid, she knew that she in the end, waited until she was older and tore up the ones who killed her mother with her bare hands, and a few of her wolves. She had dinned on a feast that night of her revenge. She had heard a word once, someone calling her delusional...but she couldnt find that word at that moment. The only word that came from her dry lips was the word DeLerium....<br>From that day, Hippolyte took her under her wing and taught her the way of the Amazons, she taught her fighting, skill, techniques. She was a quick learner of the weapons, especially the Labrys and staff. Hippolyte taught her the education only a Queen could teach a person who knew...sadly...nothing...She even taught her how to use utensils to eat food. DeL was intriged by it all, and soon became like the daughter Hippolyte hadnt had at that time.<br>In the few short years of Themsicrya, DeL has been issued ranks, awards, and titles, but nothing like the title she holds now, the one most sacred to her, the one she worked hardest for...Princess...<br>Until her dying day, Themiscrya and the amazons and wolves within, will be her family.<br><br>This is my most fondest Themsicrian memory..<br><br><br> <p>         ~~* DeL *~~~*Amazon DeLerium*~~*Princess of Themiscrya*~{}Pain is just weaknessLeaving the Body{}</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm7.showPrevMessage?topicID=22.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm7.showNextMessage?topicID=22.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm7.emailToFriend?topicID=22.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm7.threadControl?topicID=22.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm7.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=22.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm7.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=22.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm37">The Mythical Odyssey Forum<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitefrm32">The Mythical Odyssey<option value="amazonsunitefrm35">Amazon Nation Alliance<option value="amazonsunitefrm33">Character Descriptions<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm30">Amazons of the Sacred Circle<option value="amazonsunitefrm34">Amazons of Lesvos Island<option value="amazonsunitefrm38">High Mountain Tiger Clan<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm31">Amazon Language<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals<option value="amazonsunitefrm39">Guild Applications<option value="amazonsunitefrm40">Sisters of Chadesia</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm7>Amazon Bardic Works</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
