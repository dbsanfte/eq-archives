His eyes flickered with burning blue flames of their own. Underneath his strong jaw clasped together tightly were the immortals strong hands with which he wrestled the Titans long ago. The light played on his face and made him seem dark and gloomy, like Hades he looked. <br>
<br>
He pondered and pondered some more until finally he resolved the conflict that ate at him. Reaching a hand into the darkness he pulled on something and immediatley a bell rang. He placed his hand back in its former position and waited patiently until one of his servants opened the door and a flush of brightness poured in from the hall. Poseidon told the man to call for four distinct immortals to come and meet him down in Aigai.<br>
<br>
The man left immediately closing the door shut behing him after being given the orders. He yoked up a pair of immortal horses to a small chariot and set out to send this message to the immortal he was told to give it to. The message was: <br>
<br>
               Greetings,<br>
                          I Poseidon call you to an important meeting at my palace. We shall be discussing the things that are currently happening among the immortals and some of my plans as to how we shall go about putting them into action.<br>
<br>
The messages were to go to Apollo, Iris, Demeter and Artemis. As they were sent out the god waited patiently for their arrival. The candle light jumped and disappeared as Poseidon blew at it. Darkness took over. <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugoddessartemis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goddess Artemis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 338<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(4/17/02 2:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=247.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/mogoddessartemis/images/triplemoon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Call for action!!!!!!!!!</span><hr size=1> ~Artemis was siting by a waterfall, a stag by her feet, around her were the animals of the forest. The birds in the tree's sang there beautiful songs as the rabbits hopped aroung playing, a smile sat on her lips. Around her, her nymphs danced and frolicked. She looked up as she heard the distinct sound of a chariot and horses, and smiled as Poseidon's servent approached her. He stepped from him chariot and bowed to her.~<br>
" Oh divine one, Goddess of the Wild, I bring forth to you a scroll from your uncle Poseidon."<br>
~He spoke as he handed her the scroll. She took it with her hand and nodded to him.~<br>
"Thank you servant of Poseidon, you may go."<br>
~Her nymphs giggled at the man and ran to him, placing a ring of wildflowers upon his head, then ran off, to collect more. Artemis herself laughed, as did the servant, he bowed respectfully to the Goddess and was off.~<br>
~Artemis rolled open the scroll and read the contents. What her uncle was talking about, she didnt know...what was going on with the Immortals? She hadnt heard of anything, and she was the one who spent alot of time with them, well, more then any of the others these days anyway. Artemis was always curious, but not more then cautious. She knew her uncle held ill will towards her, and she didnt even know why. She never even cared for that matter. He considered her a brat, she onsidreed him a pompus arrogent fool, full of himself. So she guessed they were even. She rolled up the scroll. It was about the immortals, and for that, she would show civility towards her uncle, no matter what the childish way he might treat her, atleast, she and everyone else knew better. She would go o his palace. But not right away, she would not waste the beautiful day that Demeter bestowed upon them, with her sour uncle.~ <p>~ The Silver Goddess~<br>

After another unexpected month and a half leave of absense Apollo was being summoned to once again return to the bustling never ending drama otherwise called Mt. Olympus. Shaking the golden locks from his azure eyes he swiftly made his way to the door opening it slowly. His eyes matched with one of Poseidon's servants.<br>
<br>
&quot;And to what do I owe this pleasure?&quot; Apollo smiled walking from the doorway, further into his palace. The servant stood there bewildered as to what to do.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well are you going to just stand there? Or are you going to come in?&quot; Apollo laughed as he poured himself a cup of nectar.<br>
<br>
&quot;I come to you with news from the sea. Your Uncle, The Trident-Bearing Poseidon, Lord of the Earth and of the Sea implores you to come to his palace. He wishes to speak of things concerning the current unrest on Olympus. It would greatly pleasure him if you were to attend.&quot; he handed Apollo the written note, which Apollo snatched up and read quietly to himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well, you may go. But before you do, bring this to him.&quot; Apollo scribbled down on a piece of the finest paper...<br>
<br>
&quot;Dearest Uncle, I would be delighted to stop by at your palacial estate to discuss issues at hand. It has been far too long since our last get together. Do tell me if I should bring anything...<br>
Your beloved nephew, Apollo&quot;<br>

All of his palace has become silent. There are no noises outside the room that Poseidon can hear and his messenger has not yet returned from his assigned duty. The God waits longer, perhaps an hour or so then the loud crash of the palace doors being shut echo throughout the halls.<br>
<br>
As the slapping footsteps get nearer to where he is they stop suddenly and then the door is knocked on. Poseidon opens his eyes and looks toward the invisisble door. 'ENTER' he says in a commanding voice. It is his servants head that peers in from the bright light of the hall to tell the God he has completed his mission. Poseidon then gives him further instructions. When the guests arrive he is to invite them in to the meeting hall and Poseidon himself will know when they are there. After Poseidon arrives to greet his requested guests the servant is to close all of the doors that lead to and from the room so that the conversation held therein will be kept secret, for none can penetrate into the depths of the sea where Poseidon dwells as none can penetrate into the depths of Hades to find out his secrets. <br>
<br>
Having gotten his orders the servant closes the door cutting off the light from the room darkness which seems to slowly eat up at some reminicensce of the remaining light in the room.
