He recovered though and managed to save some face, by clearing his throat, nodding lightly, as though he'd known that the sacrifice would not take place in the village all along.  He smiled at her, &quot;Forgive me if I do not participate in the ceremony later?&quot;  His eyes focused on her for a moment, and his mind raced with thoughts, 'By the gods, she has the most incredible eyes.'  He swallowed hard, moved towards her slightly.  &quot;Vasillissa, if you are not otherwise occupied in the morn, perhaps you'd accompany me on my morning walk and then breakfast?&quot;  Of course he was asking for more time alone with her, what man in their right mind wouldn't?

Thank the Goddess for Solari and the others, Alexiares reminded herself.  For here she was, free.<br>
<br>
The sound of music at one end of the pavilion caught Alexiares's ears.  A grin graced her face, as quickly her feet began to move her over towards the sound.  This was something that she knew and was sure of.  Like the beat of her heart, music was life to Alexiares.  Her palms seem to lift up magically, her wrists twisting them upwards.  Her barefeet began to move across the floor of the pavilion in a light dance.  The little silver bells on her ankles and wrists light sounding as her hips began to sway with her feet's movement.  Her palms upstretched to the Gods, Alexi danced gazing up in praise.  Spinning ever so slightly from time to time, the dancer had a calm relaxed smile. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=archeressofdaggerpoint>Archeress of Daggerpoint</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 57<br> <font color=#993300>(5/16/03 1:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=472.topic&index=70>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Leaving?</span><hr size=1> Tala watched the others quietly for a long time, leaning back against the wall in silent thought.

He left the area as dignified and gracefully as possible.  His eyes moved over the form of Alexiares as she danced.

Be careful of your heart and who you give it to.&quot;  Then he mentioned his birth mother.  Hippolyte took a breath.  &quot;No, I have not seen her in sometime, Theseus.

It was not easy to talk of Gabrielle. All knew better then to even bring her up around Hippolyte.  As she spoke to Theseus, Hippolyte was careful of what she said.

<br>
She stopped speaking and then looked to Theseus.  &quot;Because of you...these male children are now taken into villages secretly to their temples, or some even reared for a short time with their mothers.  But...they cannot remain.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hippolyte stopped speaking again, &quot;And that goes into politics of life that you and I need not discuss.  At least not here.&quot;<br>

He took a deep breath, his eyes alternating between the dancer and the Vasillissa across the way talking with the other amazon.

Lifting her feet higher as she spun around and lept from time to time.  Her wrists twisted around like serpents, held high and out from her body.  Letting her hips almost lead her movements, Alexiares seemed to be nothing more then a bit of willow branch caught in the breeze.  A mystical smoke left a fire near them and seemed to follow the dancers, touching their skin and swirling with their movements. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vasilissadelerium>Vasilissa De Lerium</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Vasilissa Apo Themiscrya</span><br>  Posts: 130<br> <font color=#993300>(5/23/03 7:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=472.topic&index=81>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/deleriuml9/images/del2.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .....</span><hr size=1> ::She looked to Tala and nodded.:: &quot;It will be sad to see you go, but if you must go, then you must go.
