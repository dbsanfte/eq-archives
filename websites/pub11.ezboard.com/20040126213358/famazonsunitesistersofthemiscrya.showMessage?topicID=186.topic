Careless auburn tresses flow over her shoulders and catch the wind, as her brown eyes search this new area in which she had never ventured into before. As the mare slowely lumbers into the village, the small woman is  noticably an amazon. Under her skin cloak..she wears a bodice emblazoned with the mark of Hera.  Her skirt is pleated leathers that fall over a purple chamis skirt. Her brown eyes dance around the quiet village as she brings her mare to a stop.  She listens quietly and then senses that the village inhabitants are busy in their huts.  She turns her mare around and rides back down the trail to the Amazon Forests::<br>

From the moment she'd seen the proud warrior atop the mare grace the trail, she had been following, silent in the trees.  Since her return to Greece she had not yet seen any of her sisters.  As a matter of face she had been avoiding the sacred lands.  Perhaps out of guilt, fear.<br>
     Yet now here there before her was something that could not be denyed.  An amazon.  As the hour passed she drew closer to place a face with the familar armor.  Heart pounding heavy in her armored chest.  A cloak of shadows hid her tall frame, metal hugged her form as if she was born into it.  Gloved fingers curled, gripping the bark of a tree without mercy as a gasp escaped parted lips.<br>
     No.<br>
     Sweet Artemis.<br>
     Those timeless features could not have been worn by another.  Yet she remembered hearing of the Queen's death.<br>
     It's impossible.<br>
     Leaping down to a lower branch as the amazon drew her horse to a stop just outside the village.  Shaking in fear the young woman stared at the vistage of a ghost.<br>
     Hippolyte.<br>
     The great queen she'd known to be slain at the hands of her sister Penthesileia.  There in the distance stood the reason for the Furies wrath against her beloved.  Now alive and breathing in all her glory.  Her heart cried out to anounce herself.  Drove into her the desire to bleed from the shadows and greet this noble woman.  But instead, like a coward she remained hidden.<br>
     Fighting to breath the painted amazon remained hidden even as she watched the woman turn her mare and move away from Abydos.  Even when she saw this she didn't have the strength to call out and stop her.<br>
     Like a child she saw this woman to be the symbol of her youth, her home.  Tears fell freely as in desperation she lept to the ground and stood silently behind the amazon as she rode away.  The prodical could only fall to her knees as the vision faded off in the horizon.<br>

      The amazon assasin rose to her feet and cried out into the empty air before her.  Panic causing her shoulders to heave in effort to control her breathing.  She felt Artemis' appearance a moment before she heard the great goddess materialize behind her.<br>
      Spinning in rage she stalked forward.<br>
      &quot;How could this be?!?&quot;<br>
      As always the Olympian was silent.  Perfect features let no hint of sympathy show to the raging woman.<br>
      &quot;I don't understand!  How can she be alive?   If Penth was cursed for killing her sister.  Then urged, NO...DRIVEN to Troy by guilt over this.  How can she be alive here and  now?!?  I'm not mad.  I know the Queen's face.  Is this some vision you've given me to curse my bleeding heart??&quot;<br>
      Yet her cries went unanwered as the Olympian simply lifted a pale hand to the path the amazon queen had taken.  Trembling the assasin locked her jaw and stared into the hollow eyes of her patron goddess.  It was the same when she was pulled from the battle fields of Troy.<br>
      Pure confusion.<br>
      She let a snort escape as she turned to look past her shoulder.  Gripping her mighty spear, the amazon took a lean against the powerful weapon.<br>
      &quot;Fine.....Fine...&quot;<br>
      &quot;I understand,&quot; like a woman defeted she realized that the answeres wouldn't come upon a simple breath, or at such a rude request.<br>
      When Thermodosa turned back to face her goddess she found nothing but empty air. &quot;Fine,&quot; the young amazon mumbled, &quot;I'll go.&quot;<br>
      And go she did, back in hiding within the trees.  Moving swiftly to catch up with the departing Amazon Queen.  Thoughts, questions haunting her as deeply as a whisper from the Furies themselves. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://hometown.aol.com/queenhippolyte/spinningsword.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Vasilissa</span><br>  Posts: 279<br> <font color=#993300>(3/21/01 6:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=186.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/pleiade3/ehipp.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Treetops of Abydos</span><hr size=1> As she left the village, Hippolyte allowed the mare to move in a slow walk.  It was a nice day, despite the slight coldness.  Even that, it was nothing to the blizzard that was possessing Themiscrya.  It has been so long since, she had adventured out of her beloved home.  But, Hera had sent her packing.  The Queen of the Gods had become worried that Hipp was becoming worn by all the snow and harsh winds.<br>
Brown orbs watched as the winter birds played in the leaves and sky above.  Then they sang even prouder as the sun broke free of the clouds over head.  Hippolyte stopped the mare and looked up in awe.  The sun glared brightly upon her, and she closed her eyes with a warm smile.  It felt so good, the sun upon her face.  It was like a blessing from Apollo, to this queen who was beginning to feel she would never feel that sensation again. <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

After the rider had drawn the mare to a stop she had calculated a plan.  A faint smirk caressing pale lips she moved her mask under her cloak to fit tight against her left shoulder.  Giving her a distinctive hump on her back.  The albino knelt down on one knee and pushed past the frozen earth until she grasped two large handfulls of soggy dirt.  Spreading them across her painted face.  Mixing the black with the mud to darken her skin.  Bracers were removed as she reached for her pack, taking out one of the torn tunics.  Tearing it into strips she wrapped them about her palms and up her arms.  Wrapping the rest around her bare wast and covering the tarnished breastplate.  Once again her palms returned to the filth she'd created and she spread this over the tattered cloth before rolling her whole body in the muck.  The large stead that was her battle mount flicked his ears forward.  'Two leggers'  strange animals.  He storted and was quickly silenced by a muddy palm.  Fierce, icy eyes silenced the creature with a gaze.<br>
Taking a piece of cloth she wrapped it around one side of her filth covered features.  Tilting her head to one side as she drew the ragged hood of the cloak over her head.  Casting a wink to the beast she reached for one of the spears she carried with her.  Placing the tip in the dirt her foot came down hard breaking off the tip. Next was scraping the worn surface against the bark of a tree, the Amazon assasin casting quick looks over her shoulder to make sure her fellow sister was still within rage.  The cloak covered her tall frame and she hunched over grabbing the now worn rod in her hands and moved forward ahead of the rider. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=thermodosa>Thermodosa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#993300>(3/21/01 9:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=186.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The road from Abydos: A Cry.</span><hr size=1> Apollo allowed the sun to remain caressing the landscape only long enough to tease the frosted tips of the trees. Once thin tendrils of clouds covered the warmth the forest almost groaned autibly in protest with the sudden absence of the sun god's touch. The Anemoi(winds) picked up with suprising fury and a curse from the road before the rider could be heard.  A huddled figure barely stood clutching to an old staff like a life line.  Decreped, deformed, a female voice cursed more than one god as the winds pushed on, sending feeble knees to crush against the harsh ground.  A bandaged, filth covered hand dared to reach forward blindly in an attempt to find some solid structure to draw up the haggard body.  Finding nothing, the hand clawed, before trembling into a fist grasping the wooden staff once more.  Hooded head bowed in defeat as a keeing, maddning wail filled the air drawn forth from the shadowed form. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://hometown.aol.com/queenhippolyte/spinningsword.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Vasilissa</span><br>  Posts: 283<br> <font color=#993300>(3/28/01 5:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=186.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/pleiade3/ehipp.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The road from Abydos: A Cry.</span><hr size=1> As the sun slipped behind the clouds, Hippolyte frowned and then looked before her.  Down the road from her, she could see a feeble form that seemed to speak an utterance of a curse.   With a raised eyebrow, she urged her mare forward down the road towards the tattered being.  The mare walked cautiously as the Queen lead it nearer.   The beast snorted as the figure wailed.  Hippolyte stopped it a few feet from the form.  Her brown eyes ran over the ragged cloth that barely held onto the bent form.   As she sat upon the mare, some 20 feet away, she spoke, "Are you endaksi?"  Concern covered the face of the auburn haired queen.  She watched for an answer. <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

     It took her a moment to realize that it wasn't the winds that had spoken.  And it took even longer for her to look past her shoulder, down the road a few yards to the Amazon sitting atop horseback.  But when she did, the hunched over frame tenced.  Picking up the stick as if it were a bat.<br>
     &quot;Don't think I can't see you!  I know you're there.&quot; She called out in a shakey tone.  Waving the piece of wood as if only able to see the shadowy form of the Amazon Queen.<br>
