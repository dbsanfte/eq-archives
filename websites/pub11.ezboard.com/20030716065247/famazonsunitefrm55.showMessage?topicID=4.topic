<br>
Naiba is walking down a path one morning. She looks uneasy, which is nothing out of the ordinary. Slowly, she moves towards the lake, making sure that no one is following her.<br>
However, when she reaches the lake, she looks around in shock.<br>
<br>
There are Scythian tents filling the area.<br>
<br>
She shrieks something out in amazonian, and makes a run for it, bolting back towards the village.<br>
<br>
Dori was on the training field with a class of senior warriors. Yes even the senior warriors needed to train and practice. Being Chiara's student and the Princess of the tribe, it was left up to her to make sure the Queen's Royal guard as well as the senior warriors stayed in fighting condition. They were actually drawing a crowd from the younger trainees while they engaged in a large mock battle. Dori was up against her best friend Tristin, and actually looked like she was easily besting the girl that was an excellent warrior in her own right, but this was one thing that Dori was good at and she excelled. <br>
<br>
The warriors worked hard and many were rewarded by resignation of their opponents in the battle. Dori and Tristin were the final two and they put on an impressive show for everyone else, until Dori spotted Naiba run into the village like Hades was right behind her. She stopped short and dodged one of Tristin's swipes and quickly made her way over to the girl, &quot;What's wrong?&quot;<br>
<br>
Odessa had settled down with some of the elder women of the tribe, who where telling her stories about the old Queen before this..&quot;Rhia&quot; came. She listened, wanting to learn all she could when Naiba came toward the village, screaming in the Amazon tongue. She looked to the elder's, her eyes apologizing more than her words; and ran out to where Dorianna and Naiba were, she made it in time to hear Dori asked Naiba what was wrong, before she sensed something...something wasn't all well within the Amazon lands.<br>
<br>
Naiba looks at Dori in shock, her eyes are wide with fear.<br>
<br>
&quot;There are Scythians coming!&quot; she shouts before scuttling off, leaving the other women to ponder at what had caused such a reaction in the young woman.<br>
<br>
Naiba rushed over to her hut. She stormed in and flung open a chest, inside it was more weapons than anyone could have forsaw Naiba having<br>
<br>
&quot;...Scythians?!&quot;<br>
<br>
Odessa thought she smelled something fishy, she loooked to Dori, waiting her orders.<br>
Baily looked up from watching Dori and Tristin fight. She heard the commotion and frowned, heading back to her and Chiara's hut to alert her of the situation.<br>
<br>
Dori's eyes widened at the news Naiba brought. She yelled to Tristin and Lexi, &quot;Get the warriors ready, and make sure the children are taken to the Great Hall.&quot; She looked to the new comer, &quot;Are you interested in standing with us?&quot; She waited for her answer.<br>
Rhia had heard from a passing Amazon what was going on. She set about getting the children and elders into the Great Hall. <br>
<br>
She snagged a couple of girls just past their Rites and sent them to secure the food storage area. She knew they were itching to go into their first battle, but she knew they were more help to her here then they were out there.<br>
<br>
Chiara has heard the commotion outside, and grabbed her sword and put on gauntlets by the time Baily makes it to their hut. <br>
<br>
&quot;Baily! What's going on? And, where's Angie?&quot; Baily, though not a warrior, could certainly be trusted to take care of herself (even if Chiara made a point of seeing that wasn't necessary) but Angie was just the age to get herself into trouble...<br>
<br>
Naiba arms herself quickly and walks into the middle of the village. She looks around to see all the amazons frantically doing their own thing. Quietly, she moves to the stables to collect her horse, Anat.<br>
<br>
Dori knew that their visitor would stand with them, so she nodded to the woman calling Tristin over, &quot;Have the warriors get their horses, the archers should get to the trees, I'm going to grab my gear and to make sure Zoe and the Healer are ready. Tell Chiara I will be back right away.&quot; With that Dori took off toward her hut, scrambling inside she quickly pulled on her battle gauntlets and attached her fighting sword to her back, she then stuck several small throwing daggers into her boots, finally she picked up a longbow and a quiver of arrows. She then made her way quickly to the healers hut to inform Zoe. <br>
<br>
Stepping inside she looked around for the small blonde, spotting her at the back of the hut sorting herbs, &quot;Zoe, there is trouble, I have to ride out with the warriors, stay here and be prepared.&quot; She knew she was going to be in for a little fight on this, but Zoe had her job to do just as she herself did.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, Zoe didn't need Dori's warning, and she also wasn't prepared to fight against her intended spouse. She knew her job all too well.<br>
<br>
She and the healer had been tending to a few minor wounds inflicted during the mock battle the senior warriors were staging when they heard the commotion, and one of the bandaged warriors had rushed out of the hut, grabbed the first passing Amazon and inquired what was going on. Scythians. The name made her shudder a bit, but only because she didn't know what to expect. She'd never been taken along during any sort of battle, and her warrior training, while up to par with staves and daggers, wasn't up to par when it came to swords and bows. She and the healer, Cyn, were already shoving the senior warriors out the door (not that they needed shoving; they were eager to get out there and defend the village) to prepare the way for the injured. But she did take a moment to look up at her beloved, and smile very slightly. They'd win this; they had to. There was a wedding that was going to take place, and soon. But for right now, they all had a job to do.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll see you soon, then,&quot; the healer's apprentice looked up at the Princess with a tight smile. &quot;Stay out of trouble.&quot; Her eyes looked up at the Princess imploringly, but she didn't say anything further. No need to make it any harder on either one of them.<br>
<br>
Rhiannon was taking a head count in the main hall, trying to make sure that everyone was there. To all of the elders, this was old hat, so they were all there. Rhia was more concerned about the children. <br>
<br>
Try as she might, she couldn't get an accurate head count. She kept coming up one short. <br>
<br>
&quot;Children! If you could sit in a line right here please? I want to make sure everyone's here!&quot; Rhiannon shouted so that all the children could hear her. <br>
<br>
One child, a bright eyed girl about 7 spoke up. She was missing a tooth in the front row, and spoke with a lisp. &quot;Angie'th not here. I thawed her outthide when that shy lady runned in and thcreamed at everyone.&quot;<br>
<br>
Naiba quickly untied Anat from the pole that she would always be standing next to. The other horses appeared somewhat nervous as the scholar saddled her trusty steed. Once firmly atop her horse, Naiba kicked her flanks and ducked down low as she burst from the stables. Various Amazons were forced to jump out of the way as the two raced through the village and straight into the forest, heading for the Sycthian camp…<br>
<br>
Odessa blinked, and she ran to the stables; brining Freya from her stable saddling her up quickly. She jumpes atop her horse, and rode out quickly next to Nabia.<br>
<br>
Naiba looked over at Odessa, and for a moment, looked as though she was going to stop and go in another direction. However, she doesn’t but ignores the presence of the other woman. Finally, she speaks.<br>
“Why are you following me?”<br>
<br>
Queen Chiara&gt;  ::on Eclipse, rides up to the healer's hut Dori and Zoe share:: Kiss the girl, and let's get a move on Princess... ::teasing a bit, but her demeanor is serious:: <br>
<br>
Princess Doriana&gt; ::looks back over her shoulder at Zoe and winks::Be back soon....::Heads out and whistles loudly, knowing that Tristin got Apollo ready, the horse gallops over and stops right in front of Dori::I've sent the archers to the trees....what are your orders? ::she asks, as she gets onto the tall firery horses back:: <br>
<br>
Queen Chiara&gt;Naiba's certain the army she saw was Scythian... they're almost as good on horses as we are. But, horses do have one major disadvantage... which is? ::casually testing Dori:: <br>
<br>
Princess Doriana&gt; ::grinning::The riders can be knocked off them... ::she settled into her staddle and took the horses reigns, ready for a good fight:: <br>
<br>
Queen Chiara&gt;They're also confined to the ground. ::a pause:: I'm not in the mood to lose any more sisters than necessary today... what I want your unit to do is harass them. <br>
<br>
Princess Doriana&gt; ::perking up at that::Really? We get to play? <br>
<br>
Queen Chiara&gt;   ::nods:: I want the archers up in the trees to shoot three or four at a time, and disappear before they even know what happened. Lure one or two Scythians away from the group, and kill them that way... I want them afraid to even stop to eat. <br>
<br>
Princess Doriana&gt; ::serious now::It will be done....where will you be? <br>
<br>
Queen Chiara&gt;  Setting booby traps, and hiding the rest of the horses... kill or capture as many of theirs as you can. When they are demoralized, tired, and have lost most of their horses and leaders we'll attack formally.<br>
<br>
Princess Doriana&gt; ::lifts a brow about the order to kill horses, something she found very hard to take::Uh..ar..are you sure? <br>
<br>
Queen Chiara&gt;  ::recognizing Dori's reluctance:: Kill them only if you have no other choice. I don't like the idea either, but if the Scythians keep them they'll use them to kill our sisters. <br>
<br>
Princess Doriana&gt;  ::nods::I understand....and where will Rhia be? ::concerned about the new Queen:: <br>
<br>
Queen Chiara&gt;  Last I saw, she was seeing to the children and the food stores...::starting to ride:: If things go badly, we're going to need to keep an escape open for them. <br>
<br>
Princess Doriana&gt;  ::kicks Apollo's sides and matches the Queen's pace::Zoe and the Healer are ready for anything to come in....Tristin and the others are ready as well.. ::looking up ahead she could see her group of warriors on their horses, itching to go:: <br>
<br>
Queen Chiara&gt;  ::nods:: Good... one more thing. See if you can get an idea of who's in charge.::slightly feral look:: <br>
<br>
Princess Doriana&gt;  ::taps her fist on her chest::Yes ma'am....::is all business now, kicks Apollo and moves over to her sisters, giving them their orders::MOVE OUT! <br>
<br>
Queen Chiara&gt;  ::rides off to complete her part of the plan... some deep part of her enraged at the thought that someone would dare attack her tribe::<br>

Once she was sure everyone was settled, she headed out the door to see if she could find Angie. <br>
<br>
There was no real danger as of yet, so she could spare a few moments to look for the young amazon girl.<br>
<br>
At the bottom of the stairs to the Hall, she stopped and looked around at the large village center. It was bustling with activity, the warriors all getting ready for the battle. <br>
<br>
She reached out and stopped a passing athelfi. &quot;Have you seen Angie?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, my Queen, I haven't seen her all day. Did you try Queen Chiara's hut?&quot;<br>
<br>
Rhainnon shakes her head. &quot;No, but thank you. I will look for her there&quot; Rhiannon lets go of the woman, who immediately runs off to join the other warriors. <p><center> <img src = "http://user.netomia.com/angelkim/rhia.png"><br>

&quot;You know the way back to camp, Freya...go on.&quot;<br>
<br>
The horse gave a reluctant snort and then went back toward the village. She took to the trees in a normal Amazon fashion and made her way to the Scythian village. She perched herself on a branch, waiting for the command to attack. <p>~* Odessa Sayler Loire *~

<br>
Like any Amazon warrior, Chiara knew her forest so well she could have navigtated it blindfolded, or at night.  There was one main path that led from outside her lands to Marpesia.  The Scythians were arrogant enough to use it.<br>
<br>
She began to set up a series of traps irregularly along the path... everything from arrows that launched when a string was tripped to small disguised pits to leaving meat to draw the larger predators such as wolves and bears into the area. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/unaiba2002.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Naiba2002</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#993300>(8/29/02 5:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm55.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.actressgallery.com/halle/tn_010_jpg.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What you don't see...</span><hr size=1> Naiba shakes her head.<br>

Which wasn't the full truth. She still was a girl, about 16 years of age...but her skills as a warrior were topnotch. She practiced everyday at the arena at the Academy she attended, plus it helped when she was raised in Scynthia...but, she didn't like to brag too much. She watched the small group run off and nodded to her.<br>

She'd been through the baskets of herbs dozens of times, hoping she'd have enough for what her overactive imagination told her would be a very busy day. Hopefully, it would not be so for her, considering her position within the tribe. This was to be her first real test, to see if she could handle herself during a battle situation, both as a healer, and an Amazon warrior in her own right. Cyn, the elder healer, patted her gently on the arm.<br>
&quot;Come sit down, little one,&quot; the healer chided. &quot;Until the warriors return with good news or bad, injured or not, there isn't much more we can do.&quot;<br>
Zoe sighed, and allowed herself to be led to a wooden chair. She sat, but almost immediately stood again.<br>
&quot;How am I supposed to sit still when Dori - when the warriors are out there fighting to protect me? To protect all of us?&quot; She growled softly. Through her veins coursed the same fiery spirit that most of the Amazons possessed. <br>
Cyn smiled slightly. In all of her seasons on the earth, she'd seen her share of battles, both successful and not so successful. She gently guided Zoe back to the chair, resting a hand on her shoulder. &quot;You have to sit still, because it is what the gods have intended for you, little one. You are to be this village's senior healer in only a few short weeks, and you need to learn that waiting is all part of life. It is difficult, I know,&quot; she chuckled, seeing the look of utter frustration on Zoe's face. &quot;You are such an energetic young spirit. But it is what we must do. If we are not here, lives will certainly be lost, and there will be no one to do anything about it. Being a healer is a special calling, and I am most pleased to see that you will be the one to follow me. Come ... let's check those herbs and bandages again, shall we?&quot;<br>
Zoe sprang to her feet, glad for something to do (even if this made the dozenth time in an hour that she'd done so), and meticulously began recounting each bundle of herbs - each roll of bandages - each skin of water ...  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=zoethehealer>Zoe the Healer</A> at: 9/22/02 4:20:23 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenchiara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Queen Chiara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#993300>(9/27/02 12:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm55.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/cslrwillow/images/chiarasig.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Waiting Game</span><hr size=1> Chiara arrived about a quarter candlemark later, with a look of grim pleasure on her face.
