From the west of course but no reason at all as no windows or doors were open. Then the wind blows harder and a man suddenly appears. Zephyr had a long day and was in no mood for the ooos and ahhhs of the people in the tavern. He sat right down in the nearest chair by the bar and motioned for the women behind the counter to him. <br>
<br>
    &quot; A glass of wine would be great... &quot; He said in tired voice as he rubbed his eyes. He then took out a gold piece and gave it to the women, it was much more then the wine was worth but she was not complaining.

She had just come back from Lesvos and the boat ride and the few hours it took her to get to the halfways point between Lesvos and Themiscrya, on horseback had her aching for a goblet of cold water...wich she got as soon as she walked to the bar and smiled to the familiar person behind the bar. Looking around she noticed Varia sitting with Zephry, and yes, she knew who the god of the west wing was. She knew alot about the Gods..as mch as Hera would let her know. After all , she is Hera's High Priestess.
