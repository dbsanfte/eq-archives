Spring had finally reached Themiscrya, a whole month later then in the other amazon villages.  As the sun smiled down upon the bustleing village...birds sang out in praise of the gifts from Demeter.<br>
Young Amazons trained outside in the sun..thankful to be out of the dark covering of the Trainer's hut.  The scent of steam and charcoal could be smelled from the smith's barn..the clank of metal....and the sounds of horses flirting in the fields.  There were a few of the children giggling around the baker's hut...pleading for the goodies that had sent their sweetness drifting in the breeze.  Everywhere there was life and joy.  The village seemed renewed again...and thankful.  <br>

With the spring...came time for the amazons to renew their connection with nature and Artemis.<br>
A quiet began to descend upon the village as eyes turned to see the masked amazon covered in deer hide appear upon the steps of the Queen's hut.  By the mask...all knew it was Hippolyte.  But.. the wiser..and older Amazons also knew.. what spring brought.  The masked Queen walked down the steps...eyes of the tribe..continueing to follow her everymovement.  In her right hand she held a large spear.  The spear was decorated with bones and emblems of Artemis.  Even as Themiscrya was mostly dedicated to Hera, the amazons also knew Artemis kept the life that surrounded the village.  And that life was a gift to the amazons.<br>
Hippolyte stepped up to the small stage/podium in the middle of the village.  There on the podium, she slid the spear into hands of the small 4 foot wooden statue of an ancient amazon standing next to a horse.  It was time...... <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

Not looking into the eyes of anyone..she looked straight ahead to and then walked up the steps to her hut.  Moving the curtain covering the doorway aside...and then dissappearing behind it as it fell.<br>
As soon as they lost sight of her..the amazons of the village either quickly moved to prepare.. or whispered..asking questions.  The elder's explaining to the young warriors....that this was a rite of passage they should think long and hard about taking.   <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

<br>
Aly dismounted her horse and took her amazon queen's mask off of her face. Her long blonde hair fell to her shoulders as she looked towards the Queen's hut. She held herself high as she walked towards Hippolyte's hut. The golden belt around her waist kept her body straight and as long as she wore it in any Amazon Lands, no other sister dared to challenge her. She stepped towards the Queen's hut and knocked lightly before entering.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hippolyte?&quot; She asked.<br>

She looked around the hut slightly.<br>

Before Alysia stood Hippolyte, the northern amazon could see the mark upon the chest.  Hippolyte smiled softly.<br>
<br>
"Yasoo, Alysia," she said calmly.  "I see you have come to see what my message in Scynthia was about."  <br>
Hippolyte moved towards Alysia and gazed into her eyes.  <br>
"Artemis has given us many gifts after the hard winter we were cast with by Zeus.  With this spring... I feel all Amazons should pay homage and respect to her and the creatures she has sent forth into the amazon lands."<br>
She cocked her head and a wild smirk rose upon her lips.<br>

Note, tho they weren't slutty. The guards had let her by, as she had painted two lines under her eyes (war...tehehe) and she held nothing in her hands, except for her mask. She could kill anything with her bare hands, she was after all part tiger and part wolf. Dawn grinned, her canines shinning brightly.<br>

 &quot;When do we leave?&quot; <p>Pyschotic injustice
Mommy made me this way
Evil and hungry
I'm just a craving soul
Craving for your blood and death; M'Dear
Don't worry it won't hurt..
Just a dagger or two.. 
Crimson spilling onto my hands..
Running over the flesh to drip from my elbow
Scarring the black leather pants..
Mmmm its yummy
Don't worry I only strike once...
Don't bother to scream... they won't catch me

 That was all Dawn said, and it was rather protective. Whenever hunting was involved her 'tiger pride' was never to be doubted. She was Cat through and through. <p>Pyschotic injustice

&quot;My Queen, I sense a presence.  Be it good, still unseen.&quot;  The &quot;Sniper's&quot; great empathetic sense came natural.
