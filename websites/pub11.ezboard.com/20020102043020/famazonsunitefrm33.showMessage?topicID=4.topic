It was mystery to those she married, as well. No one could ever get the details from her. . but the memories would forever haunt her. .. and definatly not by choice. <br>
<br>
 In her life, she has caused pain, and anguish. It was almost a force of habit when she travelled. . expecting to do it to those she came across. Love wasn't exactly on her list.. until she came to PMoD..and The Mogs Realm.<br>
<br>
 It was a new chapter in her life, that also brought her to the many that would unfold in the amazon nation. Options came along, that changed forever. Letting her be more open to some, and more closed to others. <br>
<br>
 She came across a few that she would bond with for life.. Wulf's mother, and Sartha. They were her sisters that she would charish for life... and give anything for...<br>
<br>
 Like any amazon in the nation.. that was the thing to do.<br>
<br>

Even in the amazon nation. . <br>
<br>
 Dawn was a key factor in many wars.. either it be because she knew the enemy..or just becuase she fought with her athelfi and risked her life to help them. But ever since she came to Themiscrya, and found her true blood.. she fought along side them. <br>
<br>
 The Centuar War, The alternate universe Rome war... etc.<br>
<br>
 But it wasn't just for her athelfi.. it was for her blood lust. It haunted her wherever she went..and wars were just a key way to feed that lust..and to control it just alittle while longer. It would and has haunted her for eternity.<br>
<br>
 Maybe immortality isn't as blissful as some make it out to be. <p>

<br>
 PMoD brought Dawn, Karton. Karton Elder Dragon. With that love she trained her instincts..her skills. But that relationship ended, when he cheated on her, when she had a miscarriage and when she found the amazons. When she found her world..he found his. And therefore..they went their seperate ways. To their new lives, and a new world. <br>
<br>
 After that.. there was Keecho. Decira Jay Keecho Darkshade. A name almost as long as his history. Their love was strong.. but each's blood and destiny was stronger. Their marriage brought two children..twins. And when they parted ways..the children went with Keecho. None of them really wanted to be amazons. <br>
<br>
 So after two failed marriages.. Dawn didn't really want to have another.. or did she?<br>
<br>
 One more.. just one more. One with a god. A god of love. Thought Cupid could do the trick.. treat her like an amazon and in the process have a woman of sorts? Naw.. Cupid was mistaken. And after a child was born..yes another child. Cupid was tossed to the curb. You don't have an amazon assassin..the Queen of them.. stop fighting. And that was what the boy wanted.. a peaceful woman. . one to dress in a dress and prance around. That wasn't Dawn. So he was killed.. and soon after a rogue center [left over from a war] killed Dawn's daughter. <br>
<br>
 But the death of Natailya Desiree didn't go without gain. With that death.. she brought back Dawn's trainee. Wulf Loire. The Prince and Savior of the Amazon Nation. So with the loss of daughter she gained a son. <br>
<br>
 Pretty odd love life.. wouldn't you say? Dare take a chance. <p>
