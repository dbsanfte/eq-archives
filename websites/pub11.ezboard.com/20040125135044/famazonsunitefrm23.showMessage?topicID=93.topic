With that he frowns and smashes his goblet of nectar against the wall of his temple and resides himself to the task of getting one of his best warlords Teragus to lead his army to take Athens.<br>

He was wearing a white tunic, and golden sandels, which shone with his golden aura. He looked to Ares, much more than hurt in his crystal blue eyes. They seemed watery and a bit puffy as if he had been crying, or forcing back tears. Apollo's face was emotionless as he spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have done wrong by you my brother. It was an opprobrium of me to talk down of you to Alecto, whether things be true or not *And he never tells a lie* I should not have went and spoken ill of my own brother to Alecto.&quot; he looks down at the floor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Its just...&quot; ::he said this, not looking up from the ground:: &quot;...you know how I am with people. I have to know everything about them. I guess its a sign of insecurity because I guess I feel that if I do not know my &quot;opponent&quot; I will inevitablly be hurt. Or it may be something else I dont know.&quot; ::he looks up at Ares:: &quot;I just wanted to do something that few have done, REALLY get to know a Furie. And you do, so I guess in a way, you are superior to me brother. And that you can carry with you for the rest of your days. I mean seem a people person on the outside, but obviously I do not have the skills to get someone to open up.&quot;<br>
<br>
He looks at Ares, a single tear strolls down his face. Apollo had never doubted himself before, but Ares had done it, Ares had convinced him that he was not invincible. And it was tearing Apollo up inside.<br>
<br>
&quot;And I also came here for this...&quot; he kneels down and places a grape vine upon the floor. The plant of peace. &quot;I would like to make ammends with you brother. I never really got to know you, which is a shame, and I wish that I could get to know you a bit better now. For I see that not many know you, not many seem to care for you. Hell, I will even go as far to say that the mortals do not fully respect you, but I want you to know that in me, you have a friend, you have more than a friend Ares. You have a brother. And though I may down talk you, though I may act or be superior, thats my job and my job alone. You know that if I ever thought you needed the help I would lend it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Another tear rolls, as Apollo looks into the cold eyes of the warlord Ares. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uxgoddessaphrodite.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xGoddess Aphrodite</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(6/28/01 9:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=93.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A moment to talk</span><hr size=1> ::the moment her name was uttered by Ares she instantly appears.
