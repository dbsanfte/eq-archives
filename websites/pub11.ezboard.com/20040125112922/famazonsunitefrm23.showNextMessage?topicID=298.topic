Is a giant cavern. A dark fog looms all around it almost making it look like another demension of a cloudy night. and in the middle stands a very large tower. <br>
 <br>
Thanatos swoops in on one of his dragons, through a tunnel opening in the side of the great cavern.   <br>
 <br>
<img border=0 src="http://gamma.nic.fi/~timbbach/galleria/Dtower.jpg" /> <br>
 <br>
He stears the dragon to a balcony halfway up the tower. There he jumps of and walks past the two skeleton like guards. One inside he starts to navigate his way through the long hallways that were dimly lit with torches. He turns and walks all the way to the end of one hallway and open the heavy wooden door thats covered in iron bars. He opens the door to a large room with lanterns lit everywhere, and around them Butterflies of all sorts fly around the room. He walks in the middle of it and lets some of the butterflies land of him.  <br>
 <br>
After awhile he lets them fly off back into the miniature jungle he had made for them. He opens another door and walks down another long hallway with many doors on the sides. He opens on and walks into a giant library of books. In the middle of the library is a desk and chair. On the desk is a very large book, pen, and ink well. He sits down and writes in the recent deaths of the day. He then gets up and leaves the Library. For some reason Thanatos felt irratated, as if something was wrong. But he didn't know what it truly was yet... But he knew that something was brewing beyond his knowledge. <br>
 <br>
He opened another door and walked into a room that had furniture and everything in it but it looked like it had been abandoned for hundreds of years. He walked over to the window that had spiderwebs growing all over the sides. Thanatos looks out to one of the sides of the large cavern... There as his pupples dialate to see better, he sees a few figures moving around slowly getting closer to his tower...* <br>
 <br>
"Souls? roaming freely? This can not be..." <br>
 <br>
*Thanatos calls for his dragon, as it swoops around the tower and he jump from the window onto it. He flys high into the air, an gets ready to swoop down on the three sneaky figures, Thanatos looks up through the fog to his cavern ceiling and sees it covered in the living dead.* <br>
 <br>
"Great Zeus! How in Tartaru-..." <br>
 <br>
*Before he could finish his sentance, about 10 of the souls drop down towards him. Most of them miss and fall towards the ground far beneath him. But before the few that might hit him, get to him he pulls out his sword, *SWISH, SLASH, SWISH*. They fall to the ground in twice as many pieces. Thanatos does a U turn back to his tower.*  <br>
 <br>
"I need to find out how this has happened!" <p>~*Thanatos*~ <br>
 <br>
For some I am a fearsome being, an assailant... and ending, final and cold. For others a kind friend...

The only time she went up and out was when work needed to be done, or Ares needed her, for various reasons, but mainly work related...yeah right. She walked out of the room she created for herself that was deep within a wall, and looked around. Something felt....different, not right...and that was odd. Something not right in the underworld...when would someone hear that saying...<br>
<br>
In any event, she began to randomly walk, just to see what she could find, unbeknownst to her, she was walking in the direction of Thanatos's palace. As she closed in, something walked past her, which caught her attention, seeing as it looked downright identical to the father of the family she had dispatched weeks ago. She walked deeper into his territory and her eyes widened as she saw the specticle before her of all the souls roaming free.....that wasn't right.  She crossed her arms over her chest and headed in the direction of the path leading to the door of the palace, maybe Thanatos knew what was up.... <p>{*}In the heart of man lies Eris, Goddess of Discord and Strife, dont try to deny it. {*}</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thanatosofdeath@amazonsunite>Thanatos of Death</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.joerghuber.com/images/art_c48.jpeg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(3/16/03 1:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=302.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Eris to the rescue?</span><hr size=1> *Thanatos sees Eris heading toward his tower, silent prayer for help answered.

 <br>
"Thank Zeus your here Eris... Somehow the souls have freed themselves from there underworld bonds, I have no idea how this happened. I might hold them back long enough, while you go get help, or someone who might know more about this." <br>
 <br>
*Thanatos's eyes grew very red for a few moments, as the ground beneath them began to rumble. Suddenly things started to pop out of the ground... Armored skeletons to be exact. There were about 40 of them that began to charge into the mass of the living dead. Thanatos then jumped off his dragon.* <br>
 <br>
"Take my dragon, that it might help you, it knows its way around very well the underworld, it will get ride of any trouble along the way..." <br>

Indeed transportation was easier but, fate would decided how fast time should move, even on the wings of a dragon... Thanatos jumped back onto his dragon and took off into battle with his skeleton warriors. His eyes glowed red once again and another 50 skeletons came out of the ground to reinforce the ones already fighting. Thanatos's dragon blew a breath of fire, that seemed to make the fog around his glow with a bright orange. <br>
<br>
Ten of the souls caught on fire, and since they were already nice'n'dry they went of in flames in a snap. Thanatos did a large circle around the main area of fighting taking off many heads with his sword. He looked around him and saw that there were more of the living dead coming out of the crevaces in the cavern.* <br>
 <br>
&quot;I don't like this at all...&quot; <br>
 <br>
*Thanatos summoned much of his power and holding out both of his hands, a dark wave bursts from then and turns about half the souls into a dark dust.* <br>

&quot;I shall not be triphled with, for whoever is behind this shall feel the cold grip of death!&quot; <br>
 <br>
*Thanatos suddenly spotted a rather large figure coming through a opening in the cave. A Troll that had died three years ago, by the sword of a young hero in Southern Greece... Thanatos's sword suddenly became on fire and surged with power that it absorbed from the underworld around it. He than threw the sword as it flew almost as fast as Hermes and hit the troll in the chest igniting his body in an explosion of fire from within him.<br>
  <br>
Thanatos commanded his sword to return to him as it flew back to his hand. He then took the sword as is glowed a greyish light. The sword split and turned into to small swords, more of a Roman design. With that Thanatos continued to attack and destroy with both arms.* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hadesdarkruler>Hades Dark Ruler</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(4/3/03 12:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=302.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Siphoned</span><hr size=1> Hades sat with unblinking eyes.

He tried again to move, to seek aid, but all he could do was muster a faint groan.  He was helpless, caught in some mysterious energy-draining spell, which had trapped him unawares.

*By now the souls were pouring out of the of the openings unstoppable, and Thanatos's reserve warriror were getting few in number. Thanatos had also grown plenty more pissed about the whole situation. Thanatos had seemed to have grown a little bigger and looked plenty more like death itself. His cloak was dusty and had lots of tear marks in it it. Thanatos had turned his morphing weapon into his big wickedly curved sythe. <br>
 <br>
*WHHOOOOOOOOOSSSHHHH* *Thanatos swung the sythe around the radius around him and cut down the hight of the souls by half. Thanatos slashed back and forth at the river of coming souls with a growing anger, he couldn't keep handling this.*  <br>
 <br>
"ARES, ATHENA, ANYONE!! I NEED HELP!!!"  <br>
 <br>
*Thanatos's voice boomed throught out the caves hoping that someone's listening ear might hear it. He made another gigantic swing wipping out a whole pack of souls that were about to collide with him, that sent a shockwave after it. Thanatos took a big jump landing on his dragon that was swooping around creating little unliving bonfires. He needed to take a break but he couldn't, the line were already coming dangerously close to his tower...A small dragon flew from his tower with a pitcher full of Ambrosia, and Thanatos took greedy gulps of it.*<br>

Then like a sering knife plunging through his heart, he felt the fear which had overcome his wife.<br>
<br>
The spell which had been slowly draining his powers had been slowed through his sheer willpower.  But now, he dropped the barriers which had kept the leeching spell at bay, so that he could cast one last spell.<br>
<br>
Tapping into the immortal spark, which is found within each of the deities, Hades cast a spell which enshrouded his unconscious love.  The souls, which had been inching ever closer, were unable to penetrate the shield.  Then in a ebony flash, Persephone was whisked away back up to the surface, safe within her mother's palace.<br>
<br>
Knowing he had managed to save his wife, Hades gave himself up to the spell, and soon feel into a deep coma.  No longer was he able to avert the drain, and the spell, like a living creature, once denied, continued with greater fervor as consuming Hades' lifeforce.<br>

Running into the throne room she looks around for her fellow deities:: Someone help! ::Looking at the empty room, she runs into the meeting chamber. Seeing nothing but a few servants cleaning, she yells at them:: Where are the other gods and goddesses? Where is my father?!::The servant nervously shrug:: N-none of them are here dear mistress.. Everyone is gone doing who knows what...<br>
<br>
::Persephone sucks in her breath in frusteration:: Well find them and tell them that the souls of the dead have overrun the Underworld and that Hades, and the dark gods are in need of immediate aide! Go now! ::The servants bow quickly and scurry off. Persephone stands in front of a war hero's tapestry saying to herself:: Those servants won't find the other gods in time...Thanatos and Eris need help, and my poor Hades...If only I could.. ::Persephone stops talking while staring blankly at the tapestry:: <br>
<br>
::As fast as she came, Persephone runs back out to the courtyard and quickly mounts the horse. Leaving as quickly as she came, Persephone makes a hard, fast race for Sparta. After a half an hour, she arrives at the remains of a bloody, fierce battle. Persephone recalled Hades and the dark gods speaking of an upcoming battle and the awaited toll of new souls to arrive. While eating her food, she would hear them speak of who would be in Tartarus and whom would go to the Elysian Fields. Looking around at the lifeless bodies, she quickly finds the Spartan leader on the ground, holding his sword tightly to his dying heart. The leader looks up as the goddess with the radiating aura comes to him, gently kneeling while placing his head in her soft lap (sort of like Arwen in the Lord of the Rings flick when she first met Frodo ).<br>
<br>
Shh..Do not speak soldier...for you have fought hard and brave and will have your rightful place in the Elysian Fields..But there is one more battle there you will have to complete. My husband, your Lord Hades, as well as the rest of the Underworld, lie in great peril for the souls of Tartarus are free. You must find Thanatos and tell the heroes of the Elysian Fields to fight so they may put an end to our dilemma...please... ::The leader stares into her with misty eyes and coughs up blood through his mouth while barely speaking:: Yes my lady...my queen...::With moist eyes, Persephone leans down gently kissing his parched bloody lips as his soul departs for the Elysian Fields.

As Eris was pushing open the door to the palace enough to let herself and her remaining minions in, she was attacked by hundreds of souls, they knocked the sword from her hand and hands grasped her, pulling her away from the door, and the palace, her minions fought, but there efforts seemed helpless as the more and more souls strewed up from the ground.<br>

And almost as if gravity was sped up, many white hooded figures speed from the ceiling to the floor of the big cave. Movement is heard all around Eris and the souls dragging her are quickly pulled away and blasted way from the cloud of protection. <br>
 <br>
Just as soon as the cloud had came, it disappeared. There standing was Hypnos wearing a white cloak, and around him stood other white cloaked figures but there faces where wrapped in white cloth, except for there eyes, which glowed a bright blue. There weapons were silver staffs with a mere round white stone at the top. These were Hypnos's new henchmen, which he created from the essence of the cobalts that he sent back into the enigma of Tartarus. These were the Sleep Templar, Mages of the Subconcious. Hypnos walked over to Eris who was lying on the ground, and extended his hand out, as his Sleep Templar kept back the other souls.* <br>

In the depth of darkness where his mind and soul had been hiding, a shaft of light appeared.  From within, he could hear the call of his beloved, Persephone, willing him to return to her side.<br>
<br>
Like the song of the Sirens, Hades could do nothing but comply.  And so he flew, intangibly, up towards consciousness, up towards his love.  But as he approached consciousness, something dark and heavy prevented his return.  As hard as he tried, pushing against this phantasmal force, Hades could not return.<br>
<br>
On the verge of panic, Hades struggled, like a person fighting for the last breath of air before drowning.  But the invisible power pushed back just as hard, forcing Hades back down.<br>
But Hades wouldn't be denied.  With a last desperate lunge, Hades tore free.  Yet something had gone wrong.  <br>
<br>
After the sudden glare that had erupted from the struggle, Hades looked around.  He could see his Persephone, cradling his head, while gently feeding him ambrosia.  But he also saw his body, lying lifeless and still upon the floor.  He stared at himself, and realized that he had become what his kingdom was based upon.  He had become a bodiless soul, weightless and gossamyr-like, wafting upon some unseen breeze.  Shocked and terrified, he tried to call out, and realized he had no voice.  He then tried to re-enter his body, and realized he was barred from doing so.  <br>
<br>
He had in essence become a wraith, voiceless, and powerless, forced to watch things that unfold around him, incapable of doing anything in return.  Filled with anger and the overwhelming sense of futility, Hades screamed a voiceless, unfulfilled scream.<br>

They all had bows and arrows, and began raining arrows on the zombie army. Another hole opening up in the other side of he cavern and a small army of skeletons came out, heavily armored, and aranged in a flank.  <br>
 <br>
These two things would have to hold off the advancing mob of souls for the time being. Thanatos threw the pitcher away and flew hard across the tavern and threw the opening which he had originally come in through. He flew and swirved through the  tunnels that led to Hade's Palace, dodging reinforcements of souls. He finally reached Hade's Palace and burst through the window of the room Persephone and Hades were in.  <br>
