He was being examined, measured, weighed, by each and every deity.  Was he a threat, could he be a threat, or could he be a possible ally?  These and many others were the unspoken questions apparent in everyone's mind.<br>
<br>
And so Hermes held onto Maia that much harder.  The strength and courage she had shown him, prevented him from turning around and running.  It would be so easy, to just disappear, Hermes thought, the world is so big, and filled with so many places to hide.  <br>
<br>
&quot;No, I must be strong&quot; whispered Hermes to himself.  <br>
<br>
He was starting to feel confident until the Erinyes blew in.  His knees were about to shake, when Maia mentally projected to him &quot;Be strong my son, be strong, for the both of us.&quot;  Looking up, Hermes nodded to his mother, and readied himself.<br>
<br>
It was like being in the presence of a living inferno.  How could beings encompass so much anger, even immortal beings, without combusting spontaneously?<br>
<br>
Alecto was the first to approach.  Borne upon the heat of the deadly Sahara desert, Alecto was outright dangerous.  Hermes tasted bitterness, the bitterness of very pungent medicine.  The kind that either cured if you were strong enough to last through its effects, and the kind that killed if you failed.  <br>
<br>
Hermes let out a small breath of relief when Alecto had tired of toying with him.  Until he saw Megaera.  <br>
<br>
Megaera was slick, the kind you try to scrub yourself off of, and no matter how hard you try, it still clings on.  Hermes realized there was a  difference between Megaera and Aphrodite.  Aphrodite is naughty, but playful.  But Megaera is the kind of naughtiness that can get you into very serious trouble.  In a sense, Megaera is like a drug, very sensuous and deadly.  One taste, and you become hooked.  You long for more, and will do anything for it.  Until nothing in the world matters.  Megaera is like that.  Touch her once, taste her once, and you're burnt for life.<br>
<br>
With terror, Hermes realizd that he still had one more sister to deal with with.  Tisiphone, probably the most deadly of all of the three sisters.  She approached Hermes directly, without even acknowledging Maia, and offered Hermes a present.  Hermes watched the innocent-enough toy, but realized the connotations to it.<br>
<br>
Tisiphone is very cunning.  Hermes realized that she was very similar to a deadly flame.  A flame so deceptively warm, and so very welcoming.  The kind a weary traveler dreams will be burning in the fireplace when he comes home.  But not knowing that the flame would suddenly erupt, so large would it become that the inferno would burn both home and occupant.  That was what Tisiphone was.  The deadly hunter, setting a trap to ensnare the unaware.  To Hermes, she tasted like blood, bitter and sweet.  The cloying sweetness that draws the prey ever closer to its death, and the bitterness of knowing that one is forever doomed.<br>
<br>
As Tisiphone showed Hermes the toy, Hermes pretended that he was enraptured by it.  But he secretly hoped his charade would not be discovered.  Hermes wanted desperately to remain unnoticed by the Erinyes.  Being burned once would be painful enough, but being burned thrice would surely be deadly.<br>

Athena appeared amongst her siblings. She passed each of them as if they didn't matter at the moment, which they didn't. She only cared for one thing that time. . .Hermes.<br>
<br>
As she walked past the gathering of the male Gods, she turned once and grinned at each of them. She was the virgin Goddess, the temptress, much like Aphrodite only none had ever been able to conquer the favored daughter of Zeus. <br>
<br>
Her mother had been Zeus' first wife, Metis. She was the first and most wise, Athena was chosen to overthrow Zeus. It was decreed by the Fates. Perhaps that was why Zeus favored her so greatly. Athena had no grudges against her Father. She loved him dearly, but if the time came when he had been killed, or had chosen to go on his own, she would glady fill her Father's shoes. . . or should she say throne.<br>
<br>
Her gold glimmered in the light as she nodded a greeting to Maia. She then kneeled down to face her half-brother. As she looked into his eyes she saw purity and a soul of loyalty. She smiled seeing this. &quot;You shall indeed be one among few of honor on Olympus young Hermes.&quot; <br>
<br>
She too knew what he was going through. Although she was the first conceived child of Zeus, she was not born until the others had been. Most of them were children of Hera, or mortals, or other Nymphs and Driads, but she was the daughter of a Goddess, and at first her brothers and sisters hated her for it. <br>
<br>
&quot;In time they shall soften their hearts to you Hermes,&quot; She spoke to the boy, &quot;But do not fear them, for I have heard that Hera herself has sworn to keep you out of harms reach. The sister Furies do not wish you harm either.&quot; She smiled up at the sisters, especially Tisiphone. &quot;They are not here to bring harm, but justice to those that do wrong. You have done nothing wrong here little brother.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled to the child and blinked those hazel eyes that shook Olympus on command.<br>

Apollo liked the child, he could tell that the two would become fast friends and probably become partners in crime. His eyes met the young Hermes' and Apollo immediatly felt the excitment, anxt, and other bubbling emotions. With a smile he walked over to Hermes, his golden aura shimmering. He smiled down to the child and picks him up, placing him on his shoulders.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lets go for a ride!&quot; Apollo said, still himself a child in many ways. Even in appearance he was a child, a mere boy of 17. His hair brustled along as he ran from the temple, his little brother clinging to his head. He liked forming the bond his Hermes, he was bound and determined to be the boys favorite brother, and Apollo rarely did not get what he wanted. Apollo placed Hermes on the ground, watching him interact with his world.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will make this one great...&quot; he said to himself, planning to be a big brother/ father type to Hermes, for the Fates know that Zeus would rarely be around for him. Apollo laughed and raised his hands to his lips, whistling, calling forth to him his wolf pup Ashley. Ashley was a blondish blue eyed wolf pup. He was great with children and a good friend.<br>
<br>
&quot;You like dogs?&quot; Apollo asked, bending down to greet Ashley, who greeted him with a slobbery lick. Ashley soon moved over to Hermes and started to sniff him. He happily yipped and started to run about.<br>

But, she had a piece of the heart of Zeus, the King of the Gods.  And even more now, her son had place on Olympus.<br>
She was thankful for those who seemed to stand by here, yet she was still cautious.<br>
As Apollo took Hermes and became playful with him, she calmed down a bit of her motherly protective instincts. Maia could tell that Apollo was going to be an important brother to her son.   And that he already cared much for him.  This brought her a bit of peace.  <br>

It is just the first time I bore her &quot;husband&quot; a son.&quot;  Narrowed eyes glared at the Erinyes.  She knew the Titan's power.  She herself was the daughter of Atlas.

His uncle was completely mesmerized by his enchanting wife.<br>
<br>
Smiling a secretive smile, Hermes turned around.  He knew through instinct that someone very special was approaching.  In a blaze of golden fire, Athena emerged.  It was as if molten gold had taken form, for she was decked out in glorious auric splendor.<br>
<br>
Hermes became intrigued by the gogon's head emblazed upon Athena's breastplate.  It seemed the gorgon was still alive, still attempting to petrify any who dared to gaze in her direction.<br>
<br>
Hermes laughed to himself.  His cousin had wrested the city of Athens from their uncle Poseidon through a simple olive tree.  To Hermes, that's what Athena tasted like. It wasn't that Athena tasted like an olive tree, it was that Athena tasted of victory.  Whether victory was obtained through tremendous hardship, or through simple sharp wit, victory is still an ambrosia.  And to Hermes, that's what Athena was.  A woman of incredible fortitude and morals, who understands that the reward comes not only from the accomplishment of the goal, but also through the struggle as well.   <br>
<br>
Before Hermes could say anything to Athena, he was suddenly swept up onto the powerful arms of his brother.  Giggling, Hermes sat upon Apollo's broad shoulder, while playfully twirling Apollo's golden hair.  He realized what a great couple Athena and Apollo would be, if they were not so closely related.  He of the golden hair and she of the golden flame.  <br>
<br>
Feeling as if he was sitting on top of the world, Hermes waved playfully at his mother and to his other cousins.<br>
Then suddenly, as if a sudden cloud had suddenly eclipsed the sun, in swept another of his cousins, Artemis.<br>
<br>
Hermes could tell from the sudden bunching of Apollo's muscles, that he did not get along very well with his sister.  And judging from the scowl upon Athena's face, she disapproved of Artemis as well.<br>
<br>
Athena doesn't like the way Artemis approached her goals.  Artemis will gain, through any means, obtain her goals, whether they be noble or foul.  Being the goddess of the moon, and therefore of the dark, Artemis was not above using trickery and deceit.  This Athena abhors, for it made a mockery of her noble morals.<br>
<br>
As Hermes sat upon Apollo's shoulder, he was shocked at the kind of disrespect Artemis was showing to his mother.  Somehow Apollo must have sensed the unhappiness for he tightened his hold upon Hermes, and patted Hermes on his knees.<br>
<br>
Apollo and Artemis, the immortal twins, were like the two sides of the same coin.  One was shiny, bright and new, whereas the other was the dark, and old.  Therefore whenever there was a coin toss, the victor would offer thanks to the sun, whereas the loser would often curse his luck moon.<br>
<br>
Artemis tasted like nightshade, a poison that grows through the  glory of moonlight.  Tasteless and odorless, it made a great tool to remove ones enemies and even friends without detection.  It is often said that Artemis coated her arrows with nightshade.<br>
<br>
Hermes asked Apollo if he could set him down.  Once back on the ground, Hermes went to his mother.  Seeing the sorrow in her eyes, Hermes nodded to Athena, thanking her for the idea.  <br>
<br>
With a grand gesture, Hermes created an ivory throne, made from the tusks of the long-gone wooly mammoths.  With patterns created of jade, gold, and platinum, it showed the glories of Maia and of her glorious lineage.  Carved upon the throne are the names her devoted worshippers used to thank her for her blessings.  Stretched over the seat were cushions made of the finest Polynesian silk, stuffed with wool, sheared from the finest Malaysian mountain rams.<br>
<br>
Bowing to his mother, Hermes presented his humble gift.  After all, this is his mother, to him, the most prized and valuable being in all his life.  She deserved at least a throne worthy of her stature.<br>
<br>
Seeing the smile upon his mother's face, only made Hermes heart jump with pride.  Mentally projecting to Athena and Apollo his many thanks.  Hermes eagerly climbed onto his mother's lap.<br>

All because of him, it seemed.  Hermes felt very lucky to have such wonderful people in his lives.  Getting off his mother's lap, Hermes went over to Persephone.<br>
<br>
Floating slowly up, Hermes gently placed a kiss upon his cousin's flawless skin.  This caused Persephone to focus on Hermes instead.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you cousin,&quot; whispered Hermes to Persephone.  As he gently floated around her.  Then Hermes took her hand and led her over to his mother.<br>
<br>
Maia stood up and gave Persephone a hug that spoke volumes.  And together, they sat upon the throne, clasping each other's hands.<br>

He frowned at the lack of disrespect his temple was receiving in the congregation of the gods.  He was about to verbally chastise them all for their frivolous play in his domain, when his eyes washed across the child, his child, Hermes.<br>
<br>
He was unable to remain angry, his anger would wait for another day.  The king of the gods made his way through the parting of the Olympians present to Hermes.  He gazed down at the boy god.  &quot;Hermes, my son.  You have come to fulfill your destiny.&quot;  He smiled proudly at his offspring.  Then his face took a more serious tone and his eyes danced across the faces of those Olympians present.  <br>
<br>
&quot;To those of you who have welcomed Hermes to Olympus, I am grateful; however, to those who have made his arrival and the presence of his mother a tragic event, I SHALL deal with you later.&quot;  He knew full well the words of Artemis and Ares. His eagle familiar had told all.  What fools they were to say such things not only in his temple but in full view of his familiar.<br>
<br>
He then turned his attention back to the boy.  &quot;Hermes, it is written that you shall be the great messenger of the gods as well as the ruler of travelers, merchants, rogues and thieves.&quot;  He sighed and half mumbled, &quot;Yes, apparently even thieves need a ruler over them.&quot;  He glanced at his brother Hades and then continued speaking to Hermes, &quot;It is also decreed that you shall guide dead souls to the underworld.&quot;  He watched Hermes face for any indication that this small god was distressed by his newfound duties.  &quot;You are an important and vital part of the Olympian hierarchy, my son.  Your fellow Olympians WILL strive to assist you in any way that they can as your success or failure will effect us all.&quot;  Zeus intentionally stressed &quot;will&quot; in his statement to further solidify the understanding that all Olympians would accept their new messenger god without exception.<br>
<br>
With the formalities out of the way, he walked to the throne that Maia now occupied.  His eyes danced over the throne and it's occupant, &quot;My love, I daresay that Hera has sent out a familiar in search of you.  She currently searches the mortal realm of Themiscrya and Scynthia.  If you stay to the highlands you should be safe.  I would offer you shelter here on Olympus; however, we know it is simply a matter of time before her search leads her to this place as well.&quot;  He smiled softly at his lover, &quot;I shall come to you when I am able.&quot;  <br>
<br>
He was content choosing at this moment not to dwell on the consequences of taking a consort, instead focusing on the rewards that had been reaped as a result. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table>
