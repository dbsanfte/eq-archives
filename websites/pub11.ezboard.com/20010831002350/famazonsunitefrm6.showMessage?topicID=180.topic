Part 2:  Prelude to War<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    Corpus walked back and forth within his counsel room.  His tail swayed back and forth with annoyance.  His mithril armor clinked and clang against each other as his clawed feet scrapped across the floor.  His eyes were narrowed and his breathe was hot, letting his thin silver tongue slithered between his teeth.  <br>
    The room was dome shaped, with tapestries along the walls.  Each one depicting a piece of saurian history.  One displayed a time of peace and tranquility, of the saurian empire.. small.. yet thriving in bliss.  The Next showed red haired demon women coming down from the mountain with spears, driving back the saurians.  And the last told the story of the total eclipse which brought down the God of the Dark Moon.  His eyes turned to it with admiration.  How he wished to see his God just once.  To salute him and bow in his very presence would be such an honor.  But he could feel him.  Flowing through the very tips of his fingers.  The bloodline of V'stakk were blessed with the power of the Dark Moon.  Though not as powerful, the dark magic was more than enough in battle against the amazons.<br>
    There came a knock at the door.  He turned to the door, which magically opened through the shimmer of his eyes.  Two saurians stood on the other side with a slightly confused look, as Corpus was standing at the other side of the room whilst the door opened by itself.  Corpus smiled grimly and turned back towards the tapestries.<br>
    &quot;My powers grow as war nears usss..,&quot; he hissed.<br>
    &quot;Yess.. Emperor,&quot; the other two saurians yelped as they cautiously entered the room.<br>
    &quot;So, what have the Green Talons discovered?&quot; Corpus asked. <br>
    &quot;Much information, your majesty.  We have word that the amazons are already rallying together within the northern regions of Scynthia.&quot;<br>
    Corpus sneered slightly, turning to their directions.  He placed his hands upon the large table that sat in the middle of the room, and gazed long and hard at the saurians.  <br>
    &quot;Is that so?  Hahaha... Excellent.  Sss, let them come to usss.  They'll never make it here in one piece.  We have many posts along Sicily.. their ships will be crushed by our fire power.  Hahaha, we are destine to win.  At long lassst, our nation will reclaim the honor and land we lost long ago.  And with this victory, we may repay our god's kindness through amazon blood.&quot;<br>
    The two saurians nodded.<br>
    &quot;What of the preacher?  Has Keena gained any information?&quot;<br>
    The saurians yelped, shaking their head, uncertain. <br>
    &quot;We have yet to speak to Princess Keena yet.  She is still her quarters with the hu-mon,&quot; they chirped.  <br>
    Corpus eyes narrowed slightly, &quot;Keep close watch upon my daughter.  Her age comes with desires.  I wish not for her to grow some attraction with amazon ally.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
    Eli sat upon the large bed, elegantly decorated with silver tassels.  His hands and feet still bound by the chains attached to a large weight.  He could barely move his toes let alone plan an escape from the strange city of lizardmen.  The air was filled with a unique fragrance of roses and spices.  At first it irritated his nostril, but like some exotic drug, he slowly began to fall under it's influence.  From behind a silk covered doorway stood a shadowy figure.  Slender and sleek, with the curves of a snake.. but the attraction of Aphrodite.  For a brief moment, Eli could have sworn it was Alysia.. but he came to realize where he was:  Keena's bedroom.  <br>
    The silk drape came down with a swift swipe of Keena's clawed gauntlets.  Upon her attire was eli's robe.. or what was left of it.  It was torn into pieces, and tailored into a new top and loincloth, which fit her body quit well (Of course, Eli was a bit disturbed seeing his robe fitting a woman better than it did him).  With a hungry grin, she slithered her form to Eli's side, inspecting him with quick sniffs to his neck.  Sweat began to form upon his brow, knowing Aly would probably kill him if she knew what was going in.  But something else was on his mind as well... How could Keena, who was very human indeed, be the daughter of Corpus V'stakk?  <br>
    &quot;You're not like the other males,&quot; She hissed into Eli's ear.  &quot;You smell so much better.  Pure.  Fresh.  Smarter&quot;<br>
    Eli raised a brow and spoke with a nervous voice, &quot;T..thanks... I think.&quot;<br>
    She grinned, pushing his back against the bed.  Eli yelped much like the saurians, not liking the situation one bit.<br>
    &quot;I'm in heat,&quot; She said huskily.<br>
    &quot;Whoa, whoa whoa!&quot; He pushed himself back up.  &quot;Not that I don't think you're a very attractive girl.. but you're only, what?  16-17?  I'm old enough to be your father!&quot;<br>
    Keena snarled loudly, pressing her claws against Eli's throat.<br>
    &quot;You listen to me, Eel-eye... I am Keena, princess to the Saurian nations.  I do what I want.  I do what I please.  And if I want to mother your broodlings, then so be it.  I am in heat and if I don't become fertilized now, then I'll have to wait another year to do so.&quot;<br>
    &quot;F..fertalize?!  I haven't even fertilized my garden in 3 months!&quot; he cried.<br>
    Keena quickly shoved him back onto the bed, forcing a kiss from him.  Eli quickly pulled his head away, accidentally shoved her onto the ground.  Eli blinked, as did Keena who looked up from the floor.<br>
    &quot;I.. I'm so sorry,&quot; he whispered looking over the side of the bed.  Keena could only grin wildly, flipping to her feet and crawl back onto the bed, stalking the devi.  <br>
    &quot;How can you be Corpus' daughter if you're human,&quot; he blurted out, hoping to distract her with questions.  The princess stopped in her tracks and raised a brow.  She gave him a slight smirk and sat Indian style beside him.  Flicking a brow strand of hair from her face, she began to speak her tale...<br>
    &quot;It was about 10 years ago,&quot; she began.  &quot;I lived in a village south of Varsith with my mother.  She was very beautiful, but very poor and sold her body to support me.  Times were rough, and the Saurians took over the village.  The saurian were kind and generous to my people, sharing their wealth.  In return, they asked for assistance, and fine goods that we produced, as payment.  The villagers agreed and did just that.  Four months later, my mother became sick and died... I was left out on the street.  One day, a rabid wolf got loose within the village and attacked me.  I could do nothing but defend myself.  I killed it with my bare hands, strangling it to death..  I did not know it, but I was being watched.  With blood on my hands, I turned to see the Emperor himself, looking down on me.  He was proud and saw potential in me; As a great warrior of his army against the Amazon threat.  And so I was adopted.&quot;<br>
    Eli looked down with sadden eyes, then looked back up to her.<br>
    &quot;Tell me of the Saurian.. Their history.  What drove them into war with the Amazons.&quot; he asked.<br>
    Keena looked to him with curiosity, then looked down and away.  &quot;Long ago, the Saurians lived in peace within the Northern lands which is now amazon territory.  We were small at the time...Living in small tribes, living off the land in total balance with nature.  One day, we came in contact with humans.. Large female humans, with weapons and masks.  The saurians were frightened and asked them to leave.  The people of the tribes wanted no part of mankind, but the humans were persistent ... at first they would come down, exploring the land, as if charting it.  The saurian knew nothing of violence or war... we simply kept a close eye upon the newcomers.  Then they came once again and demanded we leave the lands.  We stood our ground and refused to leave.. But then the arrows streaked across the skies and pierced our shamans dead.  The tribes scattered through the woods as they were mercilessly hunted down and out of the lands.  We were helpless and defenseless.  Then one night, the moon's shadow came over the sun, casting it's blanket of darkness upon the frightened tibes of Sauriania.  From the shadows came the one that would grant us the strength to liberty.  Our hearts were filled with rage and hatred for the one's He called the Amazons.  He weaved his magic upon us and made us stronger, faster, and deadly.  On that day, the Saurian Empire changed.  We were no longer the tribe we use to be.  Anger filled our hearts.. And revenge was all we could think about.  So we charged into the new amazon nation, slaughtering all.  There was no mercy..  None..  But then a light dawned upon the amazons... their strength suddenly matched the saurian's power... and once again we were driven back into the shadows... Until now,&quot; She growled.<br>
    &quot;Keena,&quot; Eli whispered, placing his hand upon her slender shoulder.  &quot;We can end this war together.. There is no reason for blood to be spilled.  Time has passed and we can mend the wounds caused by both species.  You've already created a peaceful society with mankin...&quot;<br>
    &quot;But the amazons will hunt us down!&quot; she shouted.<br>
    &quot;Not if you create peace with them!&quot;<br>
    Keena paused, looking back to him.<br>
    &quot;You are certain that it can be accomplished, huh?&quot;  She smirked.<br>
    &quot;Yes.  I know it's strange to you, but I care about the Amazons and Saurians.&quot;<br>
    &quot;You must be a saint..&quot; She whispered silently.<br>
    &quot;I'm just a man.&quot;  He smiled.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    Corpus sat upon his throne, scanning over several parchments and scrolls.  Three dark colored Saurians approached the throne with a sneaking stride.  Each one had green talons and leather straps wrapped around their chests'.  Corpus raised his heads towards the guests with a smile.  Each Saurian bowed the Emperor.<br>
    &quot;Ahh.. Green Talons.  Such a pleasure to meet the elite clan of Chin.  Was your journey to Varsith a pleasant trip?&quot;  Corpus asked.<br>
    &quot;Hai, Master.  As promised, we scouted the Amazon lands on our arrival.  We wrote down the coordinates of each village we came across.  We apologies for our tardiness, Master, for we had a few run-ins with the enemy,&quot; The largest of the Green Talons spoke out with an asian accent.<br>
    &quot;Really now?  Sss, and where are these amazons now?&quot;  <br>
    &quot;Rotting away in a ditch, Massster.&quot;<br>
    Corpus could only laugh with grim pleasure, as the Green Talon unraveled a bag filled with Amazon heads.<br>
    &quot;You have done well, Green Talons.  You will be rewarded greatly for your courageous acts.  Go now.. Eat, rest, and get ready.  War will be upon us soon.  We will need all the help we can get against the filthy mammals.&quot;<br>
    Each of the Talons bowed in respect and walked out in a single filed line.  Before Corpus could reach out and grasp one of the heads out of the bag, Keena appeared beside him.  Corpus hissed lowly, turning towards his daughter, and barked angrily, as his moment of glory was rudely disturbed.<br>
    &quot;My Emperor,&quot; She began.  &quot;I have a request..&quot;<br>
    Corpus growled and demanded what she wanted.<br>
    &quot;I have information, which I gathered from the priest.  He says that the amazons will not attack as long as we declare peace with them.  Let us declare peace with the nation of the beast women.  We've done well without war so far.  The Odusians are no threat to us and live along upon the shores of Greece.  We can set up a treaty to get back my husband to be, Ambassador Sslithe... an exchange... Hu-mon for Saurian.&quot;<br>
    Corpus couldn't believe what he was hearing.. It was blasphemy to his ears (If he had any) and was just about to strike her down when something clicked into his mind.  Suddenly a smile curled from his snout and he nodded his head.<br>
    &quot;Yesss... A treaty.  For peace.  Of course, my precious.  We will do just that..&quot;<br>
    Keena smiled brightly and hugged her father, and ran back to her room to tell Eli the news.  As she left, a Saurian Noble stepped out of the shadows and towards Corpus' side.<br>
    &quot;Are we declaring peace with the Enemy?&quot; The Noble asked with a bit of disappointment in his voice.<br>
    &quot;Do not be stupid,&quot; growled the Emperor.  &quot;Sss.. Let those filthy mammals think we wish peace.. and when they turn their back...  We'll rip out their spines!  I will not give up so soon.  Victory is on our side.  We will not disappoint our god again!!&quot;<br>

It made her proud to finally see the sisters gathering together for the well-being of the Nation. <br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome sisters!&quot; She yelled.<br>
<br>
&quot;We are going up against a great enemy. One that has existed since our fore-mothers begot this Nation. My tribe! They destroyed many of our fore-mothers. . . They have attacked our allies, attacked our children in Athens! And now they have kidnapped my husband.&quot;<br>
<br>
She sighed merely thinking. ..<br>
<br>
&quot;As much as I hate waging war on others, now is the time to fight back against these creatures! One weak link in the Amazon Nation will tear us apart. I will not be that weak link!&quot;<br>
<br>
Every day she was looking more like the warrior she had grown up to be, more like the Samsara that she was, and less like the wife of the Avatar. <br>
<br>
&quot;A great Amazon once said, 'Do not sacrifice your lives for the Amazon Nation, Make our enemies sacrifice theirs!&quot;<br>
<br>
As she was about to raise her sword in the air, a large arrow flew by her at warp speed, slightly hitting the side of her arm grazing the skin gently almost cutting it. Alysia eyes looked to the post the arrow hit as a large scroll dropped from it much like her war scroll had in the other villages. She dismounted her horse and grabbed the scroll reading it over with wide eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sariah! Bring out the Prisoner!&quot;<br>
<br>
Sariah nodded and unlocked the cage that Sslithe had been held in. His wounds had been tended to and he was fed as well. Alysia was a Queen and a Warrior, not one to torture unless needed. Alysia looked to the Saurian as Sariah brought him out clad in chains to keep him still. <br>
<br>
&quot;It seems they want you back Saurian.&quot; She knew he had a name, but as long as he called her human, she would call him Saurian.<br>
<br>
She turned to her sisters.<br>
&quot;The leaders of Varsith have asked for a treaty. They gie us Eli in exchange for this one.&quot;<br>
<br>
Some of her sisters nodded their heads, others wanted war. When Alysia was about to make her decision, a younger amazon ran in through the gates. The girl must have been no older than 18 years old. Her hair was damp and pieces of her mask still clung to her clothing. She held one hand against her side blood still gushing out. <br>
<br>
Alysia ran to the girl as she collapsed.<br>
&quot;Eeris, what has happened?&quot;<br>
<br>
The young girl took a deep breath in trying to hold back the blood that choked her. She finally spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;We did as you asked my Queen, we were on our way to Rome to warn them.&quot; She coughed. &quot;The Saurian lands surround Sicily, near the coast of the bright colored sea.&quot; Her voice was harsh and in a light whisper almost. &quot;The group of us were almost there, crossing the boarders to Rome, when they attacked us.&quot; Tears began streaming out of the girls face. <br>
<br>
Alysia was almost crying as well. There was no greater pain than seeing her sisters in pain. &quot;Where are the others Eeris?&quot;<br>
<br>
Eeris' eyes welled up with tears once more.<br>
&quot;Dead. Beaten and beheaded. They let me live to come home, to show you what they are capable of.&quot; She began crying deeply.<br>
<br>
Alysia held her close knowing that she was so close to death. &quot;Sariah, Lily, take Eeris to the Healers hut and tend to her wounds quickly.&quot;<br>
<br>
Eeris took hold of the Queens hand and shook her head. &quot;No my Queen, it is too late for me.&quot; She looked skyward in awe. &quot;I can already see them . . . see the wolves come to take me home to the others.&quot; She spoke of the Ancients in the Lands of the Dead. &quot;But I might still be able to help my sisters here.&quot; Her voice was getting softer as death came closer.<br>
<br>
Alysia held her sister gently. &quot;What Eeris. . .?&quot;<br>
<br>
Eeris leaned in close. &quot;They spoke of their God, they called him the one that Shadowed the Moon. The Dark one who gave them their powers. Their strength.&quot; She gulped a bit. &quot;They have alliances with assasins, I dont know who . . .&quot; She smiled up at her Queen. &quot;Eli is alive my Queen . . .&quot; Tears began comming once more. &quot;They don't want peace Alysia . . . They want the blood of amazo ..... &quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
And with that . . . . the amazon died.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Alysia paused for a moment and turned back to her athelfi. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;WE RIDE!&quot;<br>
<br>
She set her dead athelfi down and mounted her horse charging out of the village gates. It would be a long ride to Varsith, but somehow, Alysia knew that they wouldn't make it there. That the Saurians would come to them. . . . <br>
<br>

Her pet, Eyes, was already high above the sky, looking down at the lnds. Eyes was an eagle that gave her a landscape vision from above when she needed it.<br>
<br>
Her eyes flashed a dark blue and she saw Alysia heading a few miles across the way. She turned her tiger in Alysia's direction and rode towards her.<br>
<br>
After the few miles she had caught up with Alysia. She slowed her tiger down only a small degree as she called over to Alysia, &quot;How shall we attack?&quot; She didn't dare bring her tiger any closer to the Queen's horse for a safety measure. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 436<br> <font color=#993300>(8/21/01 4:55:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=180.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The small numbers from Themiscrya</span><hr size=1> The small band of Themiscryans journeyed north.....keeping their eyes and ears tuned to any dangers.  Hippolyte had not known of the kind that their Northern Athelfi were at war with.   So, she and her athelfi were ready for anything.  <br>
<br>
Then she stopped the small group..raising a hand up.  She could hear thundering hooves not far from them. Cocking a brow, Hippolyte looked to Anippe.  With a flick of her wrist and just a look, she had sent Anippe on to check out the noise.  The amazons sat silently upon their horses.  It was not long before Anippe returned and rode up beside her Queen.  <br>
<br>
&quot;It is our Northern Athelfi, my Vasilissa,&quot; she reported in a hushed voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well, let us join Alysia's army,&quot; Hippolyte spoke and then nodded to those who had remained with her.  The amazons quickly rode in the direction of Alysia's tribe.<br>
<br>

Alysia was full of hate and pain. This kind of Darkness hadn't risen in her since she rode with Livia, or perhaps the first Centaur war that took place near Themiscrya. Where she and Dawn fought along side eachother. <br>

The spots representing the lizard people were forming troops that were already leavin the Saurian villages beyond the valleyand over the tall hills. But something else made her brows crinkle in confusion. There was an array of Saurian dots that had just left one of the other amazon villages. <br>
<br>
Her eagle, Eyes, suddenly gave her a vision of the destruction done to that Amazon Village at midnight in full animation before giving her the final result of the destruction as it looked now along with a single... black flag with a picture of the sun.. blocked out by the Dark moon with three slash marks across it.... an eerie sight. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh gods...&quot; she muttered as her eyes went from the eagle's dark blues to her own shimmering browns.<br>
<br>
She looked over at Alysia. &quot;Alysia! Saurian spies just caused destruction in the Amazon Village of the Amazons of the Sacred Circle at midnight! They've already left it for the ravaging beast of the forest!&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked back at her animated map. &quot;They are a very large number, Alysia!

<br>
She turned her horse to face her army of athelfi before she spoke. <br>
<br>
&quot;I want those of you who doubt yourselves to turn back now.&quot;<br>

She had true hate in her eyes. Those who knew her when she was younger, could see the old Alysia returning. Every moment, she was becomming more and more like the Samsara that she was.<br>
<br>
&quot;Our sisters have been killed! And I want vengeance!&quot; She yelled.<br>
<br>
She looked at Gabrielle sadly, and sighed remembering her fallen sisters at Helicon. She had hoped Gabrielle wouldn't mind Alysia repeating the speach at Helicon. She felt it was needed, encouragement was needed here.<br>
<br>
&quot;Our fallen sisters, our foremother, their blood was shed by the Saurian scum. Our sisters have died but death is not an end to their spirits.  Death it's a pathway to an afterlife.  And when it is my time to join them I want to know that I can grasp them by the hands I can look them all in the eyes and tell them that their blood was not shed without purpose that we finished the job that they began.  More of us may die today but the Amazon nation it will live on forever.  That is the duty that we carry and the everlasting honor that we will hold.&quot;<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Delilah had been given vision by Eyes, a little girl on her dog back in the village... and it looked as if she wanted to join the Amazons. That wasn't such a good idea to her and she knew it, but the girl couldn't also just sit in that village in the case that a Saurian might somehow get into the village and capture her. Her tiger knew what she was about to do and had shot up it's speed immediately. She clicked her tongue twice and the tiger's form and Delilah herself where sucked into a green light that vanished only to reform itself back in the village, Delilah on the tiger sped out of it quickly.<br>
<br>
The green light was like a portal that would only sit for a minute so Delilah needed to do what needed doing and get in there quickly. Her tiger approached the girl and her dog quickly and as they came up to them both, Delilah quickly leaned to the side and down, using both arms to grab the dog and Evelyn and hold them infront of her, muttering at them both, casting a seating charm on them so they wouldn't fall off the horse until she removed it. The tiger had already turned itself around sharply and headed for the green portal and dived into it. The green light vanished from that spot and returned to the clearing in the valley where Del and the tiger had first vanished.<br>
<br>
The green light was now gone and Del still kept hold of the girl, the dog would be fine where it sat. &quot;You will regret that you wanted to watch or participate in this war, my dear. It really isn't something for you to see, but now you get to.&quot; She smiled kindly though she wasn't exactly happy, seeing that there was a war at hand. The tiger slowed it's speed so it would match that of the other horses.<br>
<br>
So there Delilah rode, on her tiger with a girl and a dog infront of her each having somehow enough space not to be squished. When the time came, Del would make sure these two were safe away from the Saurians, but could still watch and not participate. <br>
