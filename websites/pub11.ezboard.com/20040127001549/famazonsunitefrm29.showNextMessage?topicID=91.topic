Yakut nodded to the few scarce Amazons up this early, Some Tanaisian Amazons were sleepy heads. The shamaness walked down to the river and bathed. She got dressed and wrapped her hair up in the towel before going back to her cabin. <br>
<br>
Yakut packed her traveling gear which included her shaman rug, candles, pentacle disk, wand, athame, candle snuffer, staff and a travel size cauldron. After finishing up her preparations, the Amazon dried her hair, braided it and then placed her Dragon mask over her face.<br>
<br>
The Tanais Valley Queen, unlike others, wore her mask only in ceremonies or when going outside the Amazon Nation. From there, Yakut walked out into the Royal's housing area, and turned right towards Shy's cabin which was sitting next to the path that lead past Raven's Army housing and towards the center of the City.<br>
<br>
She then walked up the steps and knocked on her twin's door. Yakut was on her way to Athens, to meet up with Isabelle in XVH. Shyriana had said, Skylar could go with her.<br>

This was the first time she had been away from Skylar since he was born.. and she wasn't taking it too well. But wasn't it like that for every mother?  Not as bad as it was for Shyriana. Both her and her son had animal instincts due to the fact.. they partly were. <br>
<br>
But Skylar being every so curious was not too upset about it.. yet. He was up and ready to go and once he heard that knock on the door, he ran over to open it. Once seeing Yakut the young boy jumped up and down in excitment. He hugged onto his aunt yelling &quot;Ready to go?! Ready to go?!&quot; <br>

Yakut placed her hand on his shoulder, softly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good Morning, Skylar. Yes, I am ready.&quot;, she stood up and looked into Shyriana's deep green eyes. She knew how this felt. When Glory went to XVH with Isabelle to visit, Yakut went crazy. She'd speak in visions to Glory and Isabelle so much they were sometimes confused.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know, believe me I know. You'll want to just run out and take him back into your arms of protection. Try your best not to worry, He's with me. I'll contact you through visions at a routine time.&quot; she smiled hoping this gave some comfort.<br>
<br>
The shamaness positioned her orbs on Skylar, before extending her hand to him. &quot;You can help me saddle up ol' Hannibal if you like. If you want to ride a horse on your own, I have my young mare Clarice who would do fine.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked back to her twin sister. She still wasn't quite used to it...having someone around who was a mirrored image of you. Except for all that black leather.<br>

<br>
&quot;No Yakut, it will be fine. This is a time for you and Skylar and I believe he wants it that way.&quot;<br>
<br>
And Skylar.. he was just grinning broading and talking very fast. <br>
<br>
&quot;I wanna help saddle Hannibal! Do I really get to ride a horse myself?! All by myself?! I know I can do it, I am really strong! Is Clarice a nice horse? She sound like a nice horse. That is a really purdy name...&quot;<br>

And finally Shyriana cut off the young boy. <br>
<br>
&quot;That is enough Skylar, don't drive auntie Yakut insane while you are gone. She better tell me that you were the were the best behaved little cub ever.&quot; <br>

<br>
&quot;OKay, let's strap on his saddle.&quot; The shamaness pushed up her mask from her face, resting it on her head. She then got hold of the straps, and demonstrated how to make them nice and tight. <br>
<br>
&quot;See it's that easy. Now after I attach my saddle bag we can go to Clarice's stable and I'll let you saddle her.&quot; Yakut finished preparing her horse and went next door to Clarice's holding place. She took out the saddle and placed it on her mare's back.<br>

Skylar on the other hand was jumping around as they reached the stables. He followed directions perfectly as he helped saddling Hannibal. He grew even more giddy once they approched Clarice. <br>
<br>
He gave his aunt a big grin.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm a big boy, I can do this. You just watch and see!&quot;<br>
<br>
Tiny fingers slightly stuggled with the buckles but after a -good five minutes he completed his task. He stood back, crossing his arms with a satisfied look.<br>
<br>

And then he burst out laughing in happiness. <br>

Her short hair was standing up on end, and she looked pretty rediculus.<br>
<br>
Her sleeping palet was positioned near to the window that over saw the path infront of her hut.  She looked out the window looking for the voice calling her, and spotted Yakut.  She brought her hand up to the corner of her mouth, wiping away the drool that had collected there over the night, smiling.  Her eyes looked half asleep as she waved to her sister.<br>
<br>
Then, she crawled from her palet and stepped outside by parting the dear skins which acted as a door for her hut.  She was clad in a sleep dress made of doe skin that hugged to her torso and hips.  It was sleevless and was held to her by two straps made of white rabbit fur and skin.  The dress ended at mid-thigh and she slipped on no coverings for her legs before she stepped out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yakut...&quot; Otere glanced up at the sky, seeing only stars and the slight illumanting light caused by the rising sun, &quot;Where are you going?  And so early?&quot;  She slowly blinked, being still half asleep, and her voice really showed it.  It was cracky and sounded very low. <p>_.·.Øtere, §hamaness of the N¤rth.·._<br>
