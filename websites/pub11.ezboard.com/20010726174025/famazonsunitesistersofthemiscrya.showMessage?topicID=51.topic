First born into the Amazons... then raised on Olympus....and then to take her place in Themiscrya.  But..she did understand feeling the lose of a parent. Even if it was only her mother that was gone.  It must truly be hard on Arahuta.  For she lost both parents...and she is far from her people.  At that... Ara hadn't even met her mother's people.  It must be a very lonely feeling.  Hipp hoped that the Themiscryan Amazons could make Arahuta feel somewhat at home.::: <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>
