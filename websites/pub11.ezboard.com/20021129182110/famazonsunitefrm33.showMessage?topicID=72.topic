After hours of hard work, sweat and alot of cussing as well, a wolf cry was heard when a new Amazon child was brought into this world. The child was wrapped in blankets and laid into a specially built crib.<br>
<br>
Ten minutes later, another wolf cry was heard as the twin came into this world, she was done the same as her sister and laid into the crib.<br>
<br>
The mother fought long and hard but in the end she died of too much blood loss. The Shamaness of the tribe decided the children should be spilt apart, a message had came to her that seperating them would save the village from harm. Of course the ruling Queen agreed.<br>
<br>
The First twin, Yakut stayed in the Village. The second, Shyriana, was sent out to a tribe just North of Persia.<br>
<br>
Yakut was raised by her Grandmother, a Tribal Elder named Linda. Linda knew Yakut had a very special power, one that only Natural Shamanesses have. The Elder raised her granddaughter as a Shamaness and taught her the ways of peace. Yakut grew and became a young woman. She trained every day, and used the power she had to advise her sisters. Yakut's grandmother died when Yakut was 16. Yakut stayed in the Village and helped her sisters. When Yakut was 30, she decided to move on to the lands of the Tanais River Valley. There, she claimed the lands and became Amazon Queen of TRV.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Shyriana grew and was raised by her tribe. One night a dark god came and destroyed the tribe, and cursed the survivors to forever live in animal form and the human bodies be trapped in the Amazon Hut of the Damned. Shyriana lived on as a tiger protecting and helping a small village.<br>
<br>
Yakut adopted a young teen named Lynn and went on to have her first biological child named Raven, a child who was a blessing from Artemis. A gift for loyalty to the Amazon Nation. Though, Yakut herself does not worship the gods, she follows dieties called the Ancients. Lynn grew and had her a daughter who died from a sickness and Lynn was beheaded by a dark Goddess. One night a dark god came to TRV seeking some worshippers, but what he got was a tribe of Amazons with immortality and god ties to every and anywhere. He was smart of enough not to tempt the unknown but he did curse Yakut's daughter, Raven, to live a thousand years with dark immortal blood, she was stripped of her innocence and turned into a dark teenager.<br>
<br>
One night while in the Chadesian Tavern, Yakut met a Goddess of Peace named Christanna.  They fell instantly in love. Soon after, Lynn returned from the dead with the help of Gaia. Yakut gave birth to another child named, Glory, who is a blessing from the Ancients because they need an Amazon to protect the sacred amber. Christanna and Yakut were married, even to Raven's protest, and together, Yakut and Christanna had a child. The child is the Amazon Goddess of wisdom and skill, named Ariel.<br>
<br>
One night while sleeping, Yakut had a vision of her sister and with the help of her darling wife, Christanna, and best friend, Varia Avande, they saved Shyriana from the curse.<br>
<br>
About a month ago, Yakut gave her Queen-hood over to Raven and moved to Scynthia.<br>
<br>
Recently, while Yakut was traveling Lynn was attacked and Yakut killed the man, breaking her path of peace and losing her blood innocence. Alysia-Samsara, a very close friend, is teaching Yakut the arts of the Amazon Warrior.<br>

Yakut and Otere grew up together. Yakut was around when Otere gave birth to Hippolyte and was there trying to heal Otere when she was wounded from battle. Otere died and Hippolyte was being raised by her grandmother, Hera and being taught the warrior arts by her father, Ares.<br>
<br>
When Hippolyte was given back to the Amazons and became Queen, Yakut became a good friend of Hippolyte. <br>
<br>
Now, Yakut has family she knows nothing of, Her grandmother had more children than just Yakut's mother. So her blood line is long and rooted in Northern Amazon Lands.<br>
