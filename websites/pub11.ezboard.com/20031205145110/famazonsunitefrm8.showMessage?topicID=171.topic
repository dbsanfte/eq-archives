She followed that feeling inside her that drew her to Tala. Cascading down the Lady's body was a long light blue gown, with belled sleeves and silver outling. Covering her shoulders was a long cloak of a darker blue hue that caressed the ground and was clasped by two cresent moons waxing and waning. The Lady pushed back long tresses of reddish brown hair causing her celtic braid bracelet chime against her earrings. She had never left the Celtic World before now, but she had not come alone. Her loyal priestess, Raven, had followed silently.<br>
<br>
The High Priestess found a gaurd and annnouced her arival and her purpose of being here, &quot;I am the Lady of the Lake, here to see Tala the Archeress of Daggerpoint, and sister of this tribe.&quot;<br>
<br>
She was let inside the gates because she posed no threat, the Amazons raised brows but tried to show respect for this obvious woman of power. Vivienne's footsteps were stealthy and her body movements were as calm as the lake the enclosed the world of Mists. She and Raven were shown to a large hut where they waited calmly for Tala. This was a strange place, all the shops, taverns, everything run by women. Vivienne had no opposition to it, indeed she would encourage it. Women were held in high respect in the Celtic Nation but the High Priestess's eyes had never seen a world based on women. It had slightly frightened her companion Raven, and so Vivienne placed an ivory hand on her adoring Priestess's hand comforting her.<br>
<br>
The Lady of Avalon was curious to see this place for it had drawn three Celts here: Tyger O'the Wind, Tala Piper Neola, and Terra Maeve Legolas. She wanted to know why the Celt women were leaving there homes and heading to a land where the Mother Goddess is celebrated in majorly different way...<br>
<br>
Maybe the phrase should be recoined, &quot;Curosity killed the Celt&quot;...The Celt were usually care-free and curious people. Of course, Vivienne was no regular celt. She was the voice of the Mother Goddess to her people.<br>
<br>
Together, Vivienne and Raven waited patiently for the Archeress. <p>§÷§Vivianne Le Fae§÷§<br>

She stood and went to the door, arching a brow as she looked at the guard there.<br>
 &quot;There's a woman here to see you. She says she's the Lady of the Lake,&quot; the girl told her. <br>
Tala's now sea-green eyes went wide and round in plain shock, but she managed to nod slowly. The Lady of the Lake...here? Asking for her of all people? Oh Goddess, what've I done to piss off someone that important, she thought. She went back inside, braiding her red-black hair back and washed her face, then went out and followed the guard to the hut where they were waiting. The large, silver-grey wolf, Lyki, caught up with her halfway, staying at her side. She adjusted the dark leather top and skirt she had donned since coming to Amazon lands, took a deep breath and hoping she was somewhat presentable, entered. <br>
 <br>
  She stopped about two feet away from the women, looking first to Vivianne, whom she recognized from the stories that had been spread around Daggerpoint when she was a child, then looked to the other girl next to her. She could hear Lyki's nails clicking on the floorboards behind her as he came in, then sat down at her side. Her heart was racing in her chest but she managed a small smile for her, and lowered her head and eyes in respect for the Great Priestess of Avalon.<br>

She smiled warmly and stood tall before the woman.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have come to ask something of you, Tala.&quot;, Vivienne came in the calls of the Goddess and so she came to Tala as her deity had ordered.<br>
<br>
The Lady moved around Tala curious of her clothing. She found it comforting that Tala had a deep accent of the Brits.<br>
<br>
&quot;I come in the calls of the Goddess. She has called you, Tala as a Priestess of the holy isle. Would you ride with me to Avalon? or do you wish to stay here?&quot;, Vivienne would dare not force the girl to come along. For the Goddess forbade it. Tala had to come out of her own free will.<br>
<br>
Raven stood and took her place by Vivienne. The Lady of the Lake looked over at her adoring Priestess and smiled hugging Raven to her side.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is Raven. She has taken a vow of silence to the Goddess.&quot;, Raven bowed lightly to Tala smiling faintly.<br>
<br>
Vivienne waited patiently and calm for Tala's answer. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>~Vivienne Le Fae~</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
&quot;Dearest Tala, fret not. You will still be able to visit them whenever you want. After your training is through, you can fully return to the Amazons as a Mission Priestess of the Mother Goddess.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vivienne would not with hold Tala from her new home, nor was she jealous. The Lady understood how Tala felt, Avalon was her home and she dreaded leaving it for anything else but Calls of the Goddess.<br>

Ih' will do me greah' 'onor ta' accomp'ny you an' tha' Lady Raven bahk' ta' Avalon.&quot; Formality was something she had had to learn about quickly in Rome, so when she spoke, she addressed the Lady of the Lake with a tone of high respect and honor.

Ever so slowly, the wolf at her side rose to all four paws and moved forward. As if he too knew who the women before him represented, he inclined his head to the High Priestess and her companion, his black nose touching the floor in a bow for a moment before he looked to them and sniffed them with interest. <br>
Tala smiled softly, watching it, shaking her head softly. Not for the first time since Lyki found her, she thought the wolf was so more than just what he seemed to be, as things in life so often are. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=viviennelefae>Vivienne Le Fae</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#8A2BE2>(5/7/03 5:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Let's ride</span><hr size=1> Vivienne smiled and folded her hands and brought them to her forehead, as a sort of welcoming for Tala.<br>
