Justine finds a home<br>
<br>
::Justine and Hipp walked out of the hut into the bright sunshine.  Hipp mumbled something about having to leave for a while and walked off leaving Justine to wander the village alone.  As Justine walked a few feet away, she was suddenly pounced and found herself on the ground, a 300 pound white tiger licking her face.::  Frost!  It's so good to see you.  ::Justine laughed as the tiger licked her face and nudged her.  Frost was one of the first friends Justine made the night of her initiation and seemed to know instinctively when Justine needed a friend.<br>
After some playing around, Frost moved off and shapeshifted into her human form.  The graceful young woman walked to a nearby hut and emerged fully clothed.  She was a strikingly beautiful woman in both forms and Justine smiled as she walked back to her.::  I need to find a home Frost.  Do you know of any huts that might be empty?  ::Frost brought her over to a small hut which had a hole in the thatched roof.  The hole was in the shape of a tiger.  Justine chuckled just picturing Frost jumping for a beam and landing instead on the straw and falling through to the room below.  Upon opening the door, Justine saw that the hut was indeed empty and seemed to have been for quite some time.::  Do you think anyone would mind if I took this one for myself?  Frost said that she thought it would be fine since she did not think the family would return.<br>
Justine set about cleaning up the inside of the hut.  Frost found a broom and was sweeping out all the fallen debris from the roof that had caved in as Justine worked on the hearth.  There was an overturned table and chairs that could be saved and utilized for the time being.  At least there would be somewhere to sit and eat her meals.<br>
Frost went outside and returned with materials to make a bed for Justine.  As she worked, Justine finished cleaning and soon the hut was almost livable.  Frost completed the bed.  It was strong with a firm straw mattress.<br>
Justine looked up at the hole in the roof.::  Guess it's time to tackle this now.  ::Going outside Justine climbed a tree whose branch overhung the roof right above the hole.  She slid on her belly over the hole, slipping a few times and almost falling.  Frost threw up the thatch to her and Justine repaired the roof hanging precariously from the branch.  Somehow the roof was repaired and Justine hoped that it would not leak.  But that would have to wait until the first rain.  Sliding backwards, Justine finally reached the bole of the tree and shimmied down.  Just before she reached the ground, she lost her hold and fell, landing with a resounding thud on her butt.  Frost and she laughed as Justine rubbed her butt.  They stood back and admired all their work.  Justine placed an arm around Frost and smiled.::<br>
Well my friend.  Thanks to you I am finally home!<br>

&quot;These are called cookies.  They are sweet and come in many different flavors.  You bake them in the hearth.  They are really quite easy to do and I enjoy making them.
