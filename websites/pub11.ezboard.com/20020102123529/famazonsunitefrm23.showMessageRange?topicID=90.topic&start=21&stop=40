<br>
*What crap is he telling Alecto...shout obusive things during sex...I don't think so. So much for light boy knowing everything. I'm not that vulgar or anything like that*<br>
<br>
The war god continues to listen to Alecto and Apollo's conversation. He hears Alecto speaking about her perfect man. In a moment of clarity he realises that no-one has ever truly loved her, or shown her any true affection. Well that was about to change. After all I do owe her.<br>
<br>
Ares walked upto where Apollo and Alecto were and put on his manners.<br>
<br>

He took a step forward, extending his hand infront of him a bit.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ares we were talking.&quot; he said, he realized he had no reason to fear his brother not in the least.<br>
<br>
'Well, here goes nothing. I mean, I have no reason to be scared, I am ofcourse Apollo, second  in power to my father Zeus.' he thought to himself with a nod. He too had seen the vonerability in Alecto's eyes, and he WAS showing her kindness, affection, and all that until his brother abruptly dragged her away.<br>
<br>
So he stood there, as he was sure Ares would not listen. And why should he stop him? He was also sure that his words could not possibly have healed the deep emotional wounds of Alecto, even if he was the god of healing. He shook the sandy blonde hair from his hurt blue eyes, choking back a tear. He knew that if Ares saw him cry he would never hear the end of it. &quot;Your such a baby!&quot; Ares would say. And ofcourse if a squabble between the two occured Hera would take her son's side, and Zeus would hear none of it. He probably would not even be around. He quickly wiped away the tears that were building up in his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know what? Nevermind Ares, you may talk to her. I have things to do.&quot; Apollo smiled radiently as always, as if nothing was wrong. If anything he made Ares seem the smaller person, as he usually did.<br>
<br>
'I tried, by Zeus...I tried.' he thought to himself as he vanished in a burst of golden light.<br>
