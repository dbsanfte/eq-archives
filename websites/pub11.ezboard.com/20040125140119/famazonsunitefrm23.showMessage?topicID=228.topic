She knew of other ways to achieve this goal, and achieve it she would. She had knowledge of where the ambrosia cave lay, but it was not that simple. She would have to obtain a certain dagger inorder to open the chamber. For that, she would have to travel far and long into the city of Crete. Where it lay deep in another cave, guarded heavily. But Velaska had no fear, she ha fought against very tough opponents in her life. She stopped her mare at the bottom of the path that lead down from Olympus and looked around, she closed her eyes and listened to which way the wind was blowing. Saying a short prayer to Hera, Artemis and Demeter to give her a safe journey, she pulled on nightmare's reigns and dug her heels into her side, she was off.....~<br>

The sun had not risen yet as she entered the thickest area. Most of the way there, she dismounted, she gave Nightmare her orders and headed off on foot. Her sword strapped to her back, whip on her side and daggers all over. The air was cool and crisp around her. The breeze getting strong as she walked up the steep incline, her cape blew around her as her hair flew wildly. For what seemed to be like hours she climbed until she reached the cliff she was looking for. Once there, she closed her eyes again and listened to the wind around her, turning, she walked to the far end and bushed away some branches of overbrush, there , the hole was, she entered quietly, feeling her way in the dark. She took her tourch from her backsachel and wraped some cotton around it. She then lit it with two rocks and stood up in the large cavern. She unshethed her sword and walked down the long path, a few times she tripped and cut herself, skinned her knee, but still, she got up and kept going, that determined look on her face. Finally, she came to the large openeing she heard about, she put out the tourch and placed it down, a small noise cam efrom it and she heard one of the guards grunt. She tensed up and grabbed her bow and arrow, peaking over the large boulder she hid behind, she saw only two guards...lucky for her, it would be easier fighting one then two. She strung her bow and let an arrow fly, right into the neck of one of the guards. The other one grabbed his sword as his partner fell to the floor in a large lump on the floor. She screamed and ran out behind the boulder, sword gripped tightly in her hand, the uard saw her and growled, swiping his old sword towards her, she jumped out of the way and blocked his blade, tripping over a rock, she fell to the ground, the edge of his blade hit her and slashed her leg. Blood began to run down he rleg as she hopped to her feet and swung her sword, catching him right in the stomach, she lifted the blade up, cutting through his chest, abdomen, right up to his throat. Another guard ran out from the dark, his elbow crashing into her lip, splitting it as his dagger rammed into her arm, she screamed and spun, kicking him in the groin and bringing the hilt of her sword down on his neck, she then twisted his head and broke his neck, cursing, she threw his body to the ground. Holding her stance once more she looked around, everything seemed quiet. She plopped down on the floor and grabbed her bag, she took a piece of swaddling from it, she lay her head against a rock and began to breath deeply. Her arm was going numb. She couldnt have this, not now.~<br>
&quot;Hera give me strength.&quot; ~ She wispered to the empty chamber, as she spoke those words, she felt as if someone was embracing her, and she smiled, she knew Hera had heard her. Gritting her teeth together, she gripped the hilt of the dagger and yanked it quickly out, screaming loudly. Taking a deep breath, she wrapped the swadling around the wound as it bleed profusly. Then got ot her feet. She walked to the wall and moved a branch that extended from it. The door quickly opened and she walked into the chamber, it was a small room, tourches alligned the wall casting off an erie glow. In the center, stood a column, on it, the dagger stood. The light relecting off of it making it look almost mystical. She walked over and looked at it, biting her bottom lip, she grabbed the hilt and held it up, a smile of triumph on her face. She placed it into her sachel and ran as fast as she could out of the room, almost getting caught between the massive rock doors as they closed. She followed her path and was outside quickly, into the now bright sunfilled mountain cliffs.~ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamazonvelaska.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amazon Velaska</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_purplespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 137<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(1/19/02 6:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=228.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/amaz0nbich/images/velaskabich.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Arriving in Crete</span><hr size=1> ~ As she walked from the caves, she shielded her eyes from the sun until her eyes adjusted to the sunlight. She blinked a few times then opened her sachel, she pulled the dagger of Helios out and held it high into the sky, letting out an amazon cry of victory. Even though she wasn't finished with her quest, she had allready gotten farther then many she had heard about, and for the she was proud. She fell to her knees, dagger in her hand as she looked up and thanked the Gods for the strength that she had. For a while she sat there, breathing in the cool air and collecting her thoughts. She removed the dagger from her innerthigh shief and slid the dagger of Helious in it's place. She got to her feet and began to walk down the path, through the trees, and back to Nightmare who stood waiting patiently for her owner. She took an apple out of her sack and fed it to the mare. When Nightmare was through, she mounted the beast, and was off again.~ <p>Queen Velaska of Lesvos Island

&quot;She's really out to do this thing she so much asked for and it is a thing I do dread. What will the making of another immortal do to the pantheon and what effect will it have on her? I hope such a thing as immortality stays out of her reach but as I forsee it is not out of her bounds. I must keep an eye on this one, another goddess may in fact be another test pertaining to the rulership of the Olympians.&quot;<br>

She had the mask drawn over her face as she reached it hours later, the peacock feather in it would allow any guard to know she was one of Hera's chosen, but sh ealso threw the amazon peace sign as well as she rode through the boundries..into Myrine, she knew o fno tribes that were here, but tribes these days, did come and go, so she didnt know, But she would keep her eyes wide open. As she passed through the boundries, she came upon a small hut, and it was getting dark. She walked Nightmare over to it and stopped, she dismounted and unsheathed her sword, she couldnt sence anyone around, but was still, as always ,cautious...she walked quietly to the door and parted it a bit, empty...just as she thought, and from the looks of it, it had been empty for a long time, and it had a fireplace, which was a good sign. She went outside and collected some firewood, then went back in and made a fire to lay by, she unrolled her bedding and was fast to sleep.

But it just proved that she must of been tired. Her body needed the rest after the fight the day earlier. She looked to her wound and flinched as she saw it red and probably infected. She didn't worry about it, Velaska was one who hardly worried about such trivial things, besides, before the sunset, there was a good chance it would be completly healed. She got up, ate some of the food she brought along with her and went outside. Nightmare was glad to see her up, and she gave the mare some water and food, waited till she was done then mounted her. Off into the thick of the woods again, but she felt more safe this time, she was in amazon territory. She looked around for any signs of amazon life, but sadly, didnt find any. It was apparent this tribe was gone. Velaska hopped thay they just relocated. On and on she went , until she reached the bottom of the cave she was looking for. Dismounting, she wispered to Nightmare to go on back to Themiscrya, she would meet her back there, she then swat the mare on her side and Nightmare rode off. Velaska stood there, watching her leave. She then turned on her heel and walked into the cave. Once inside, a boulder slid in place to block the way back out. A tight knot formed in the Queen's gut as two female forms appeared before her. They wore the cloths of peasents, but Velaska knew of them, they were the Guardians of the Ambrosia. Ancient Amazons who guard the sacred caves.~<br>
<br>
~The taller blonde one first spoke up.~<br>
&quot;Velaska, Queen of Lesvos, High Priestess of Hera, you have come here to seek the joys of immortality. We knew you would come.&quot;<br>
<br>
~ The short redhead then stood besides the blonde~<br>
&quot; First you must pass our test, to let us know you are not after the ambrosia for personal gain. That you willnot ingest this ambrosia and abuse the powers that will fall upon you. <br>
<br>
~The blonde spoke~<br>
&quot; Though we would take your vow as an Amazon that you wouldnot, many have come and vowed to us, just to fail. Years have passed since our lives, and the Nation has changed, there are very few real amazons left. Do you understand us Queen Velaska.<br>
<br>
~Velaska nodded and bowed to them both.~<br>
&quot;Yes oh ancient Amazons who protect the ambrosia. I do understand you both. What will you have of me?&quot;<br>
<br>
~The redhead looked to Velaska~<br>
&quot;Show us the dagger of Helios.&quot;<br>
<br>
~Velaska slid the dagger from her thigh sheath and held it up to the Amazons.~<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
~ The blonde and the red head both nodded, then the blonde spoke again.~<br>
&quot; With the dagger, slice your hand deeply, pouring your blood into this collecting bowl. ~ She handed the bowl to Velaska. Velaska then made a rather deep cut on her hand, blood flowed freely down it, and into the bowl, which the redhead took. Velaska tied a piece of linen from her skirt around the fresh wound. She watched as the redhead gazed into the blood of Velaska, then smiled.~  &quot;She is telling the truth, her heart blood would not lie. She would not be selfish with the gift.&quot;<br>
<br>
~The blonde amazon came over and looked to Velaska.~<br>
&quot;Then enter the cave of ambrosia and become of the immortal.&quot;<br>
~The amazons stepped aside and revealed a staircase leading down. Velaska got to her feet and walked down it slowly till she got to the bottom. Her eyes widened as she saw the chamber she was in.<br>

So far, Velaska had proved herself through the tasks set before her, and was glad that she was being sencable and thinking all this out instead of just jumping into it.

Grinning, she looked to the vine losest to her, said a quick prayer, and jumped up grabbing it, using that upper body strength that she valued, she hoisted herself high up the vine. She swun over a to a few to get her closer to the opening, making sure ofcourse, that the dagger of Helios was in easy reach for her, which it was.<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.allthingsxena.com/Image_Gallery/Season%202/TQ/gifs/TQ_175.GIF"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
She brought herself closer and closer to the trapdoor inthe top of the cave and held on with one hand. Her muscles tightening with each second, she unsheathed the dagger and looked around, there was supposed to be a slot that the dagger slid into that reached a button within the wall to open the trapdoor. She found it, slid the dagger in, and it hit home. She looked up as the trapdoor began to open, she started to swing herself slowly, so she would be beneath the door when it opened. She wasnt and the chunck of ambrosia fell past her. Her eyes widening, Velaska let go of the vine and fell after it,she grabbed it, then grabbed another vine, dangerously close to the spikes. By now, her body was killing her, her arm throbbed with pain as she noticed her stitches had popped, she didnt know when they popped, but they did.<br>

The walls trembled as she jumped to her feet and stumbled her way outside of the cavern, the amazon spirits were gone. Once outside, she fell again, taking the ambrosia out of the sachel when she had placed it. She held up a piece and thanked Hera and Artemis for there strength and protection in her quest.*<br>

True to he rword to Hera, she said she would not abuse this power, and she wouldnt. She walked back to her mare, her body and everything else, in good health, that smile on her lips. She met back up with Nightmare, pet her and mounted her, she rode off, not back to the Amazon Tribe, but to the Temple of Hera, she would have to thank her personally for the safe journey she had, had..*<br>
