Her eyes glancing about as the sun went down. That smile, sort of childlike, spread on her lips as she heard him talk to her again,in her head, she giggled slightly. A bug crawled past and she slammed her fist down on it , killing it. She smiled and picked it up. A soldier came to give her, her meal. As he left , she flung the bug at him and let out a cackle a harpie would be proud of. She looked at the food and wrinkled her nose, she hated Roman food, but she wasnt stupid,a bit crazed, but not stupid, she needed her strength, so she ate the horrid tasting meat. and waited.For what...she had no idea*~<br>

He followed them at the forrest line in the form of a wolf. Apollo sat perched on a tall rock on the lipped side of the gully the Amazon's had decided to rest in. His blue eyes watched as they set up camp, he also caught sight of Artemis, just standing and watching. He knew verywell that Artemis could feel him, he had felt her without looking. He could also feel that she wanted this to go down without a hitch, and Apollo had a feeling he could help.<br>
<br>
Apollo turned into his normal form, dressed in a white tunic with his normal knee length cape, with all the gold trimmings. Noticing the change in energies Artemis looked up at Apollo an approving smile onher face. He raised his hand, as if to say &quot;I'll do what I can&quot;, and vanished.<br>
<br>
The bustling, growing city of Rome. Indeed it would be responcible for the fall of Greece, he and the Fates alone knew this, but he also knew that his greatness would not fade, but grow as Roman's spread the Greco-Roman culture through-out the world. Apollo stood atop a towering building, knelt down looking at jail-house Lysippe was being held in. Apollo jumped from the building, turning into a mouse on the way down, he gently landed on the cill of the bared window to Lysippe's room.<br>
<br>
Hopping down onto her head, the blonde, blue-eyed mouse was quite the spectacle. Apollo squeeked and licked Lysippe's face waiting for her to wake up. He would do all in his power to help  her. <p>     *~*The Golden God*~*

She was much more stealthy on foot anyways. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamazonlysippe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amazon Lysippe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#993300>(2/20/02 5:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ravenstone.com/lig19.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> ~* Lysippe felt something licking at her face and she sat up with a start, she noticed the mouse and grunted, she picked it up by the tail and flung it as she cursed at the blasted animal, she had no idea it was Apollo.*~ <p>~*~*~* Artemis Bless the Amazons *~*~*~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uthegreatapollo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Great Apollo</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.maialino.it/musica/bsb_nick.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 172<br> <font color=#993300>(2/20/02 7:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Land/9121/nickc170.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Such hostility in her young veins</span><hr size=1> Apollo smacked against the wall and his flexible mouse bones enabled him to bounce about a foot away from the wall. Landing onto his back, he squirmed around and finally was able to readjust himself. Soon the &quot;mouse&quot; began to glow with a magnificent golden light only seen by Lysippe herself, infact the mouse was still only visible to her. In an instant before her stood Phoebus Apollo in all his grandeur, he levitated above the ground slightly, and inflated his golden aura, he adored the drama. He appeared in a royal blue tunic, with gold trimmings from his laurel crown to the sandels on his feet.<br>
<br>
Apollo smirked  to Lysippe and dusted himself off.<br>
&quot;Don't like mouses much eh?&quot;<br>
<br>
Walking to Hypnos the cat, Apollo grabbed it by the soft wrung of its neck and placed it outside of the cell. He bent down and whispered to it:<br>
<br>
&quot;Stay out of this...&quot; and he shooed the cat off.<br>
<br>
He walked to Lysippe who had bowed her head in respect for Apollo. Apollo smiled and lifted her head by pushing up on her chin. He ran a hand through her hair and spoke:<br>
<br>
&quot;Lysippe I, Apollo have come to you on this brisk February's eve to tell you that it is destiny for you and your sister Queen Varia of the Amazons of Chadesia to be reunited. Though this ordeal, as you probably have already seen will not be as easy as just getting you to her. I can only help so much for I do not want to tempt the Fates. Now come, I can help you out of here but I am afraid that is all I can do for now. If things get rough just remember...The Divine Twins are with you.&quot;<br>
<br>
And with that Apollo walked through the bars of the cell. He grabbed one of the torches off the wall and began to shake it infront of the guards. To them it was as if the thing was haunted.<br>
<br>
Guard #1:What in all of Hades is going on here!<br>
Guard#2:Its that whore in the cell, see there the figures on the floor! Its magic! ::he angrily shook the cell bars:: STOP THIS NOW!!!<br>
<br>
Apollo set one of the guards tunic on fire and waited for the guards to finish themselves off.<br>
<br>
Guard#1:MY TUNIC,SOMEONE GET SOME WATER!!!<br>
Guard#2::stumbles around and neglects to realize there is a goblet of water on the desk::<br>
<br>
Apollo smirked and grabbed the both of the guards heads and smashed them together. They both fell to the floor unconscious. Walking to the desk he grabbed the goblet of water and put out the fire. Apollo then waved his hands over the bars of the cell and they opened.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, be off with you Lysippe. May Zeus be with you. Hermes speed.&quot; and he vanished. But where he vanished remained a sword in a golden sheath and a wooden whistel encrusted in diamonds and ruby's from Egypt, along with a small note that read.<br>
<br>
&quot;To Lysippe, from Phoebus Apollo of the golden bow who shoots afar...Use this sword to protect yourself when it be needed. And use the whistle if by some mishap you find yourself beyond your means...&quot;<br>
<br>
 <p>     *~*The Golden God*~*

~* Lysippe looked up as Apollo formed from a mouse to the man. It didnt impress her. Nothing did anymore. She knew this was going to happen. &quot; He &quot; told her about it. But not to be disrespectful, she did appreciate it. She watched him get rid of the cat and the bars to the cell after he got rid of the guards. She kipped up to her feet and walked out slowly and cautiously. Looking around, she bent down to grab the sword. She left the whistle, she wouldnt need it. Her eyes went to the hilt of the sword..nose wrinkled, she never understood why anyone would want such an ugly thing. With all the jewels and such, it was tacky, more of an ornament then a weapon, but it was all she had for now. She looked over to the now dead soldiers and walked to them, she picked up there daggers and placed each in her boot. She then took a blanket left onthe ground and put it around her like a cape, there was enough material to pull over her head like a hood. She walked with no noise, the skill of an amazon, to the staircase that lead up. She somewhat remembered being brought down them, so up it was. She entered another large room, empty luckily...but for how long?  She went to the window. it was full dark. Easier to get around in the dark, but this place was so large she had to worry about finding the exit more then anything else. As she debated what to a do, a lone guard came behind her, sh esmelt him comming, Romans smelt very differently from Greeks...Romans had the particular smell of garbage. Without hesitation, she got the dagger from her boot and turned stabbing the soldier in the chest, she brought the dagger up from his chest into his throat. She left the dagger in his throat and searched him for a weapon, she sheathed the sword from Apollo and took the romans sword, they may have been worthless wastes of life, but they did make good weapons. &quot;He&quot; told he rin her head that the amazons were close by, it was just finding them, but, she didnt know who to look for, she hadnt seen her sister in many many years. But amazons could usually sence each other no matter what. She picked all the weapons she could find off the guard and all she could carry and was off to find the exit.*~ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=amazonfrost>Amazon Frost</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#993300>(2/20/02 8:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The great Escape</span><hr size=1> Frost had finally found the right prison as the whole apollo ordeal was going on.

She droped infront of the door and smiled from behind her mask to the two guards. The scimatars snaked out wide and came in slaping there blades away. A slash was giving across each stomache bring forth the wonderful blood to stain her boots. Her steps were deliberate as she made her way into the prison.

Riding through the gates of the city she saw the first Roman, drew her sword, let out a yell, and slit his throat.

Rome was so large,nothing like she had seen before,and in it's own way,Rome was beautiful.<br>
<br>
Zelia's eyes darted all around,then she turned her attention to Varia,who just slayed a roman. She shook her head slightly,then turned her attention back to the view. <br>
<br>
If they were going to fight,and possibly go up against a great number of soldiers,Zelia would only hope that she wouldn't lose control and 'change',and for her own sake and everyone around her,she would definitally use all her self control. And spilling blood was not going to be an option,in her own strength,one hit can render an enemy unconsious,thats what she'd use.<br>
<br>
The closer they got to the city of rome,the more Zelia became parnoid and with good reason....<br>
<br>
As she marched at the head of the amazons,a large roman soldier,alone,came trudging toward them,with a sword in his hand. A lone soldier,that was suspicious enough on it's own. 'Why would any city only send one soldier at a time?' she pondered to herself,with a conclusion,that once these amazons acctually entered the city,thats when they would be hit with a number of soldiers. <br>
<br>
She shrugged to herself, and quickened her pace,meeting the roman soldier half way,intending to speak with him,she didn't expect it,but the roman drew his sword back in an instant and lunged the weapon forward at her. She arched her brows,and caught the blade in her bare hand. &quot;Thats not nice.&quot; She stated,then jerked the weapon away from the soldier,and tossed the weapon to the ground. The soldier then swung a large fist toward her face,but Zel didn't move,allowing him to make contact to her chin and her head jerked to the side. She blinked and looked back at him. &quot;That hurt...&quot; She returned his rude gesture,with one of her own. In one quick movement,she drew her right fist up,slamming it hard under the roman's chin,knocking all his sences a blur.<br>
<br>
The romans head jerks upword,then he fell backwords,unconsious.<br>
<br>
Zelia then looked behind her to Varia,with a look that clearly said, 'Was that okay?'  Ignoring that her hand had been cut open from the romans sword,she new that with a few more moments,her hand would be healed completely. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uiizeliaii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>II Zelia II</A> at: 2/20/02 11:05:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenvaria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QueenVaria</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://hometown.aol.com/variaavande/images/tsianina2.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 290<br> <font color=#993300>(2/21/02 2:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/variaavande/images/tsianina2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It's beginning...?</span><hr size=1> Varia's eyes flashed with fire at the man who had just cut her wife, and with one swoop of her sword, she severed the Roman's head from his body.
