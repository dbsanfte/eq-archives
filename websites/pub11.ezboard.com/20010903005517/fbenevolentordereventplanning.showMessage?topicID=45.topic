We must, as a guild, plan a raid to slay the vile Xicotl deep within Mistmoore Castle.  I have recruited some help from some former Benevolent Order members.<br>
<br>
For this raid, I am setting the lower level limit to level 40.  If you are below this at the time of the raid, you will not be able to attend.  I realize this excludes a lot of the guild, but this is for safety purposes.  It also gives the higher members a chance to group together for something other than watching over the lower members.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Not that we mind that, but we like to do things for ourselves once in a while.<br>
<br>
Valmar shall set a date for this raid.  We will meet in Lesser Faydark at the entrance to Mistmoore, and then storm the castle with the help of Atacand, Elbrian, and perhaps Ndirya and Petra.  If needed, I am sure that we can get members of Mystic Entity to come along as well.<br>
<br>
Hope to see those of you who meet the requirement there.<br>

<br>
Some notes though.  Xicotl is not always up.  I got lucky the time we raided MM, and he just happened to be up.  So, be prepared to perhaps have a long camp ahead of us.  On the good side, Elbrian and I have learned the castle pretty well, and can manuever decently well around there.  So, there might be opportunities to pick up some other nice loots while we are there.<br>

Thanks for all the support guys, had duty on my birthday and this is a nice birthday present, (sorry not telling how old, but trust me older than most here I'm afraid and not too far away from my current lvl, lol). So therein lies my late response, the duty thing, also it would be great if we could camp some stuff if Xicotl is not up, I know Atacand had promised I think Math a crested helm and I know Elupis expressed some interest in Nightshade wreath so if we could get either one or something else someone else is interested in that would be great and as you guys know I do love to help others get stuff they want, prob moreso than myself. Also if we can get this done well the next step , at least to me will be the hardest as I have no clue what Lucan entails, so if Atacand has no problems I will need his help for that one and Kidwan has offered Kiglan and some others to help as well with that.

I was one of the 2 that Gira consulted on information regarding this raid.  I take blame for that level decision.  It was not intended to exclude players, just a matter of personal opinion based on my experience.  To fully understand my decision, however, you have to know me pretty well as a person.  I usually err on the side of cautious, and that has served me extremely well in the past.<br>
<br>
I think what is important is the goal, and nothing really else.  Most certainly people below 40 can make their way through MM castle.  Actually, that's a very nice source of xp for a group of that nature.  But I think that gets away from the true goal of this raid.  Our objective is to effectively, and safely, get a hilt off one of the harder spawns within the castle.  If you feel that you are capable of such, then I trust you.  Remember, I have fought along beside you and do know that you are an excellent player.<br>
<br>
Please just don't start a flame regarding something so simple, which is meant to be as a glorious day and HUGE accomplishment for Valmar, and Benevolent Order in general.<br>

<br>
  Having never been there I would love to have Khoal put together a raid there for the 30 something plus crowd. Would give at least me a chance to get a better feel of area and what tactics/spells  are/aren't effective. Also give ma chance to get more familiar with layout. I look at a map and think ah, piece of cake. I get there and think well, this is different. <br>
<br>
  As far as levels set though I think Khoal is far above most players his level in skill and ability. I'm not sure most players his level could accomplish many of the things he has done. Even the people he grouped with seems to support this. 2 of the people he grouped with were in their 40s. The 3rd, just short of the 40s, was a Cleric. Clerics tend to group with players at or above their level and in an enviroment dealing with undead I would equate a Cleric with someone levels above them. Remember that since most of their spells involve grouped members not mobs, Magic Resistance isnt the problem it may be for other casters of same level. <br>
<br>
  I still believe Khoal is an excellent choice to be in charge of raids and I am willing to support him in that role anyway that I can. <br>
  <br>
  On the other hand I didn't interpret this as a Guild raid but rather someone needing help to obtain a quest item. Most often in these cases there is little to no benefit for anyone other than the person initiating the quest. For this reason usually a handfull of people are asked to accompany him with the understanding that they are not expecting anything out of it themselves.<br>
<br>
  We seem to already have enough problems with guild raids with people complaining that they didn't get exp., loot or whatever. If we are to continue doing them I would rather have ones that most will benefit from so there will continued interest in future guild raids. <br>

 Sorry, I know I talk to much<br>

Glad to see val getting some help for his SF <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I wasn't going to post anything here because I was not that close to the lvl requirements.  But now i'm lvl 38 and climbing up fairly fast.  I should be at 40 or real close sometime next week.  I also think I'm now the guilds highest lvl druid, at least that I've met.  So if I can be of any help just let me know and I'd be glad to come help. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#8b0000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bbenevolentorder.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=valmar>Valmar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#D3BE74>(3/29/01 4:49:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/fbenevolentordereventplanning.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=45.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Valmar's Hilt Raid</span><hr size=1> Well, hmm guess I better put my two cps in here as well, first of off I don't want to piss anyone off or well if I have already I apologize, seems I mention one thing and everyone jumps on it which doesn't make me mad or pissed but it seems a lot of ppl want to take credit or not take credit or just be the first one on the block to do it, hmm didn't mean to get everyone in such a foul mood just wanted to get some friends together to help me get something I have only dreamed about. Pheww I know I rambled there but just had to get something off my chest, seems everyone is quick to anger nowadays and I am not very tolerant of that at times, after all I have many friends and I just wish that they could all be on the same sheet of music and just be happy with this game and others in it, but that is life different attitudes, different ideas, different opinions, hence arguments and pissed off ppl, oh well just have to smile and say thanks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Anyways the way I see it if no one gets pissed about it I would love to have anyone who wants to do this 35 and above but then again I may just be a spectator on the whole event so I guess ppl can do what they want , after all if I'm not there this very well can't happen, not being mean just me getting defensive on this issue which really very much concerns me and while I do appreciate the help I just wish ppl would ask me what I want to do and sometimes let me decide what , when, where I want to do it. So all those that are pissed off or gonna get pissed off please do so to me , after all I just won't play any more, it's as simple as that. Hate to be a hard *ss but I don't like friction and most assuredly hate to see guildmates and friends argue about trivial matters. Anyways this is not what I intended to write and I hope it doesn't piss anyone off but just something I had to say and well I am quite emotional (mad) right now after reading some of the messages here, so tell ya what when everyone can play nice and not argue and get pissed at everyone else here then and only then will I decide to do this. Like I said I hate to be mean but certain people have forced me to act like this and you know exactly who you are, nuff said.<br>

Valmar Ranthorn, not a guild leader thank Marr and not one to get riled up over trivial and senseless matters! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uatacandtrueblaze.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Atacand Trueblaze</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wierdo Pally</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#D3BE74>(3/29/01 6:32:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/fbenevolentordereventplanning.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=45.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Valmar's Hilt Raid</span><hr size=1> Well, if it matters, I was approached for information.  I gave my information, and gave my opinion.  Again, it was NOT my intent to rule out people, but this is my opinion, nothing more, nothing less.  My main concern for the level requirement finds a good analogy in driving.  I am always confident with my driving and the driving of my friends.  It is all the OTHER idiots that you have to watch out for on the road.  Likewise, in MM, you have to watchout for other people's trains which will come back slamming on you.  Simply put, groups that are 40  can handle this a lot better than those below.  Not because of player ability necessarily, just have the spells and like to handle it.  I can tank some of the mobs in that zone without swinging, and they would never hit me.  Not because I'm a better player than anyone else, just because of level and the like.<br>
<br>
I was under the understanding that Gira was planning this raid because you approached Gira asking for guild help.  I owe this guild a lot to my success, and I owe Gira a lot in general.  Gira is absolutely one of the best friends I have ever had.  Always willing to lay personal interest out of the way to help others.  I like to do the same for Gira.<br>
<br>
That being said, you can contact me in game if you want my participation.  I did not venture into this with an elitist attitude because of my level/equip or the like.  I came with the full intentions of helping a very good online friend, and a paladin brother.  If you feel that I have done/said something wrong, then don't hesitate to tell me so.  My RL profession has taught me to take constructive criticism very well, and I am always striving to be a better person.  If, on the other hand, you don't want my help, I wish the best of luck for you and hope all goes well.<br>

We are going after a specific item, the hilt of the soulfire for Valmar.  The plan is not to explore the zone, nor camp other items.  I know that the majority of people do not want to die in MM, as it is a real pain to get corpses from.<br>
<br>
We can schedule another raid at a later date that is designed to familiarize the guild with the zone.  That will give those in their thirties a chance to level so that we as a guild can storm the castle without as much aid from outsiders.<br>
<br>
I would appreciate it if we ALL stick together in order to accomplish this specific task and not break up into multiple groups, as happened at the last Sol A raid with Mystic Entity.  With all of us together, we should be able to do this without death.<br>
