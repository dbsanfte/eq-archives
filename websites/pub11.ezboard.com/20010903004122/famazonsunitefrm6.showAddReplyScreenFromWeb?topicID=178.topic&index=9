&quot;Woah Scooby,Woah.&quot;She pleads with her dog to stop,until he finally does,skidding to a stop so fast,Evelyn looses her grip and flies over Scoobys head,and lands on her stomach,but not before doing a few tumbles.&quot;Owwwch!&quot;She had skid her knee in the fall,and dropped her wooden sword,with a sniffle and a few tears running down her cheeks,she gets to her feet,and looks at Scooby.&quot;Stupid dog!&quot;She sniffles once more,and wripes her eyes,then bends down and picks up her wooden sword.&quot;You didnt hava stop so fast.&quot;Scooby mearly tilts his head,his ears perking slightly.&quot;Come on,we gotsa find the amazons.&quot;And with that she runs around until she spots some amazons dressed in thier war gear,and quickly Evelyn ducks behind a water barrel,and looks at Scooby.&quot;Hide.&quot;She whispers,and Scooby just prances around.Evelyn sighs and watches the amazons as they head off to join the others in battle.<br>
<br>
She swallows hard&quot;Everyone looks to serious.&quot;She talks to herself basically,then glances to Scooby.&quot;Okay...now we joins them.&quot;She points to the amazons leaving.Then runs over and climbs back onto Scoobys back.&quot;Follow them,k?k.Go!&quot;And Scooby takes off running after the amazons,following them... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udelilahtragedy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Delilah Tragedy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#993300>(8/22/01 11:00:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=178.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Miracle?</span><hr size=1> Delilah had been given vision by Eyes, a little girl on her dog back in the village... and it looked as if she wanted to join the Amazons. That wasn't such a good idea to her and she knew it, but the girl couldn't also just sit in that village in the case that a Saurian might somehow get into the village and capture her. Her tiger knew what she was about to do and had shot up it's speed immediately. She clicked her tongue twice and the tiger's form and Delilah herself where sucked into a green light that vanished only to reform itself back in the village, Delilah on the tiger sped out of it quickly.<br>
<br>
The green light was like a portal that would only sit for a minute so Delilah needed to do what needed doing and get in there quickly. Her tiger approached the girl and her dog quickly and as they came up to them both, Delilah quickly leaned to the side and down, using both arms to grab the dog and Evelyn and hold them infront of her, muttering at them both, casting a seating charm on them so they wouldn't fall off the horse until she removed it. The tiger had already turned itself around sharply and headed for the green portal and dived into it. The green light vanished from that spot and returned to the clearing in the valley where Del and the tiger had first vanished.<br>
<br>
The green light was now gone and Del still kept hold of the girl, the dog would be fine where it sat. &quot;You will regret that you wanted to watch or participate in this war, my dear. It really isn't something for you to see, but now you get to.&quot; She smiled kindly though she wasn't exactly happy, seeing that there was a war at hand. The tiger slowed it's speed so it would match that of the other horses.<br>
<br>
So there Delilah rode, on her tiger with a girl and a dog infront of her each having somehow enough space not to be squished. When the time came, Del would make sure these two were safe away from the Saurians, but could still watch and not participate. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udelilahtragedy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Delilah Tragedy</A> at: 8/22/01 11:05:43 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Royal Fogstone</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(8/22/01 6:06:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=178.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> *A look from the side of the mountain*</span><hr size=1> *** A large snow drift sits on a large on the side of the mountain  over looking the place where a battle will rage, as silence is every where and suddenly the snow drift moves as Fogstone rises out of the drift.

<br>
Then suddenly,Evelyn and Scooby are swept up onto a tiger!Too startled to scream,shes can only squeek,while Scooby lets out a grunt as he is picked up,then a growl,but he too is too startled to react.<br>
<br>
Evelyns eyes go wide as suddenly they are taken into a green light thing,and she then quickly closes her eyes,and wraps her arms around Scoobys neck,and if you can picture it,Scooby acctually enjoys the ride,like a dog hanging from the window of a [car].<br>
<br>
And as they are transported to wherever it is they are,Evelyn looks up at Del as she speaks.Though Del's words werent quite reassuring,her smile was,and Evelyn relaxes a bit,and though her and Scooby had a 'sitting spell' on them,she continued to cling to Scooby,and still miraculously she had her wooden sword.<br>
<br>
Looking up at Del.&quot;Im a Amazon!I can beat up all the bad guys.&quot;She nods quite a few times,as she looks at Del as if she were in a trance at how strong and brave looking the amazon looked. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6>Amazons of the Northern Lands</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
