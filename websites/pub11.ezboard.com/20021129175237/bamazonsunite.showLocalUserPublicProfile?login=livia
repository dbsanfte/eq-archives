She feels Artemis as a guide since she visited the Artemision as a child in Ephesus

Hated by many Romans for her brashness , her defense of the Ephesian Amazons and hate of her people's imperialism , misogyny and corrupted government, distrusted by many Amazons for her Roman blood, she's feeling like an apatrid, seeking to be considered and accepted as a true Amazon
What she is in reality, Sinope Amarice, an Amazon princess captured by Roman soldiers as a baby, seeking for her lost identity.

Her mother was Sipylene Artemis Eleiria, Queen of Sinope, fallen while defending Ephesus from the Romans but she doesn't know her past as an Amazon princess</span></div>	</div> 	<div id="contactinfo">		<h2>My Contact Information</h2>		<div id="email"><span class="title">Email Address ::</span>  <span class="privatevalue">private</span></div>		<div id="pm">		<span class="title">PM ::</span> 				<span class="privatevalue">disabled</span>						</div>		<div id="im"><span class="title">IM ::</span> <span class="value">None - </span></div>		<div id="link"><span class="title">Personal Link ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="" target="_blank">My Personal Link</a></span></div>		<div id="recentposts"><span class="title">Recent Posts ::</span> 								<span class="privatevalue">none</span>						</span>				</div>	</div>	<div class="spacer"></div> </div>  <!-- profile footer --> <div id="footing">© Copyright 1999-2002 <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/">ezboard, Inc.</a> All rights reserved.</div></div></body></html><!-- CSS:XHTML 2002 JR.o -->
