Gabby walked over to the stove and reached up in a cabinet overhead and grabbed a few spices. She began sprinkling in some black pepper, salt, a few cloves of garlic and some cajun type spice. She took out a pronged fork thingy from the drawer beside the icebox and flipped the meat over.<br>

&quot;So, how is Nefertiri?&quot;<br>

<br>
She stuffed another piece of bread into her mouth before picking up the honey spread and motioning for Xena to get the bread. Gabrielle walked out to her front porch and settled near the Porch steps. The Quen laid down on her stomach and propped up on her elbow. She used the free hand to take another piuece of bread off her slice and dipp it in the honey.<br>
<br>
&quot;Welp, Amazons were created by Artemis, of course. Our greatest Queens are still alive today. Hippolyte, Ephiny, Yakut and Varia. But unfortunately many have passed on, like Melousa, Otere, and Marga.&quot;<br>
<br>
She popped a piece of the bread into her mouth, chewed and swallowed before speaking.<br>
<br>
&quot;Melousa was Queen of the Amazons when we were still a Nation, not just tribes allianced as one. She was also Queen when I became Amazon Princess. Melousa was a strong Amazon, and dedicated to her Amazon sisters. She was truly a Great Queen. Sadly, she died and I was forced to return. I wasn't ready to rule as Queen so I gave Ephiny Temporary Queen-hood until I could do my duty well. Ephiny is wonderful, she is one of my closest athelfi. She taught me the ways of the staff, and I taught her that not all men are pigs.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gabby smirked thinking of Phantes and Ephiny.<br>
<br>
&quot;I had to become Queen again, and by that time the Nation had already broken into tribes. We went to war with the Romans and Ephiny was...put in a position to where she couldnt Queen anymore.  and um, I took over we won the war. I gave the Queen-hood over to Chilapa. She ruled as long as possible til  my tribe became scattered to dust. Chilapa was not a bad Queen, just a good Queen at a bad time. Now, Hippolyte was born to Otere, and she was raised by Queen Hera til she could rule as Queen....Yup, Otere died in war, and Hipp came in power.&quot;<br>
