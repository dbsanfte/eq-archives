and a god of many roles such as prophecy, truth and light. He was revered by<br>
immortal and man alike, being second in power to the all mighty Zeus.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The great divinities of ancient Greece, a divine family in which there are many members. They were the most important family in Greece you could say, controlling every thing from the sea to live stock. As in every family there is a favorite; one who the family is proud to call one of their own. In the divine family that resides on Mount Olympus, Apollo was perhaps this favorite. From the happenings of his birth, to the occurrences only days after, it seemed that Apollo was destined for greatness.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Apollo, was the son of Zeus and the Titaness Leto who was daughter of the Titans Phoebe and Coeus and twin brother to Artemis Goddess of the Hunt. He was born the best looking male in the cosmos (Aphrodite being the best looking female in the cosmos) but more importantly he was the god of music (he was skilled at singing, the lyre, the flute and he directed the nine Muses) and also of prophecy, purity, colonization, medicine, archery,Fine Arts,poetry,Power(roman), Logic,Reason, dance, intellectual inquiry(question itself), truth,shepherds,seafarring, and religious healing. He also was the god of light, of truth,plague and vindictive justification. He was the carer of herds and of flocks. His sister Artemis was watcher over young woman, and he was watcher of  young men. Many animals were sacred to him including the swan, the dolphin, the crow, the wolf, mice and locusts. Like his sister he had the ability to change himself into any animal at will. He was good an athlete as Hermes, but he was best at archery. Apollo was the first victor of the Olympic Games. Apollo  appears as a young clean shaven male (in my characters case 1<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  with straight sandy blonde hair stopping at his ears (typical bowl cut like thing). His eyes are crystal blue, peaking at a height of 6'2 his body is perfect bearing no piercing nor imperfections such as blemishes or rashes. Upon his head a laurel crown. When he was born he stole the title from Athena as the one to overthrow Zeus. He was second only to his father in power and surpassed all that came before him.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But the story of Apollo's greatness begins but four days after his actual birth! It all began when, Zeus had begun to admire Leto from a far. Being the promiscuous womanizer that he is, Zeus  acted upon his feelings for Leto. As do most of Zeus's love endeavors, (And this one was no different) their courted soon ended in a physical union. Soon after it was apparent that Leto was pregnant with two of Zeus's children. But this was the least of her problems.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hera soon found out about what happened at Zeus's latest get to together and was not at all content. Leto was by now pretty far along and trying to hide herself from Hera, maybe she could pull this off without her knowing! No such luck, Hera was blinded with rage and told Leto (who was about to give birth...it seems all divinities are born prematurely) that she was not to give birth to the children anywhere on earth, neither  on<br>
terra-ferma or an island at sea. Leto roamed the earth from Crete to Asia Minor looking for a proper place to give birth to her children. Leto had to make the dangerous journey to the floating island of Ortygia. There she gave birth to Apollo's twin sister Artemis (Goddess of the Hunt) painlessly. By some mishap, Leto was forced to cross to the neighboring island of Delos. Being only one day old Artemis had to assist in the birth of Apollo whose birth did not go as smoothly as her own. During his birth the island was surrounded by many flocks of swans. Later the swan became one of Apollo's sacred animals.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Apollo considered Delos to be his sacred island, and when he heard of the dragon Python (Who harassed the near by island of Pytho) he quickly decided to slay the beast. Now Apollo was only four days old and his mother insisted that he stay put, ordering Artemis to pay close attention to him and keep him from trouble. Apollo called to the Cyclopes and Hephaestus (God of the Forge) for silver arrows and a silver bow (with matching silver quiver). Apollo soon snuck away from Artemis to rid his own of the dragon. Python was a huge offspring of Gaea (Mother of Earth) it protected the sanctuary of Pytho from its lair besides the Castalian spring while oracles made prophecies.  The four day old Apollo soon met the serpent Pytho and with his little bow and arrow quickly vanquished the monster. Apollo declared himself leader of the oracle and quickly set forth to rid the country side of mass destruction and havoc.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For killing one of Mother Earths children Apollo was punished, having to work for King Admetus in Thessaly, for eight years. Apollo would have to wake up at the crack of dawn and tend to the kings cows until dusk. Now, Apollo was but a young kid at the time and was horrible at the job.( It taught him nothing for he disregarded all of Zeus's other punishments later on in life.) As soon has his punishment was finished Apollo swam back to Pytho in this guise of a dolphin with the priests of Crete on his back. He renamed the island Delphi after one of his favorite animals the dolphin (also sacred to him). He ordered the priests to work for the oracles at the Oracle of Delphi. He also bestowed upon one of the priestesses the divine power of Prophecy. Along with all of this he dedicated a bronze tripod to the temple, on which the blessed priestess &quot;Pythia&quot; made her predictions. From then on in Delphi he was known as Pythian Apollo.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp By now Apollo and Artemis were ten and already doing things that took most gods eons to do. On one of their family excursions Apollo, Artemis, and Leto came to the kingdom of Queen Niobe. Niobe had often boasted that she was fairer than any god. &quot;What madness is this, to prefer god whom you have only heard of to those whom you have seen?&quot; she often said. This got Apollo and Artemis angry enough, but then Niobe started to talk about how she was a better woman than Leto bearing nineteen children instead of only two. She then when on to say that Leto's two children were not even pure children. Artemis was a woman in a males hunting uniform, and Apollo was far to good looking to be a proper man! (Ladies and gentleman we have the worlds first recorded homophobe!) Now this did not go over well with Artemis nor Apollo. A day later they shot down on the nineteen children, for nine days arrows rained upon the children. On the tenth day Apollo and Artemis buried the children themselves. Only two of Niobe's children had survived for they prayed to Leto during the nine days of blood. Amyclas and Chloris survived. Chloris soon married the king of Messenia and her child Nestor was granted an unusually long life by Apollo, his pardon for taking Chloris's siblings.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Apollo was the most eligible bachelor in all of Greece. He was sought after by mortal and immortal alike.  Sadly all of his love endeavors ended in heartbreak. Among his lovers were Cyrene, Cassandra, Coronis and Hecuba. By one mishap or the other, all of those relationships ended in heartbreak. Perhaps it was because none of them truly loved Apollo, they all saw the power in being in a relationship with him. But of all his relation ships none of them were more famous than his everlasting love for the nymph Daphne.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Daphne was Apollo's very first love. But like most loves it was not coincidence that Apollo loved Daphne, it was brought by Eros the God of Desire son of Aphrodite. Apollo saw the boy playing with his bow and arrows; and being himself elated some recent victory, he said to him, &quot;What have you to do with warlike weapons boy? Leave them for hands worthy of them, Behold the conquest I have won by means of them over the vast serpent who stretched his poisonous body over acres of the plain! Be content with your torch child, and kindle up your flames, as you call them, where you will, but presume not to meddle with my weapons.&quot; Eros heard these words, and rejoined, &quot;Your arrows may strike all things else, Great Apollo, but mine shall strike you.&quot; So saying, he took his stand on a rock and drew from his quiver two arrows of different workmanship. One to excite love, the other to repel it. The former was of gold and ship pointed, the latter blunt and tipped with lead. With the leaden shaft he struck the nymph Daphne, the daughter of the river god Peneus, and with the golden one Apollo, through the heart. Immediately the god was seized with love for the maiden, and she disgusted in the thought of loving or marriage. Her delight was like Artemis's; in the woodland sports and in the spoils of the chase.  Her father said to her: &quot;Daughter, you owe me a son-in-law, you owe me grandchildren.&quot; She, hating the thought of marriage said to her father, &quot;Dearest father, grant me this favor, that I may always remain unmarried, like Artemis.&quot; He allowed this but added, &quot;Your own face will forbid it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Apollo loved her, and longed to obtain her hand in marriage. Yet he who gives oracles to all the world was not wise enough to see his own fortunes. He saw her hair flung loose over her shoulders, and said, &quot;If so charming in disorder, what would it be if arranged?&quot; He saw her eyes bright as stars, he saw her lips, and was not satisfied with only seeing them. He admired her hands and arms and her naked shoulders. He followed her; she fled, swifter than the wind. &quot;Stay,&quot; he said, &quot;daughter of Peneus; I am not a foe. Do not flee from me as a lamb flies from a wolf, or a dove the hawk. It is for love I pursue you. You make me miserable, for fear you should fall and hurt on the stones, and I should be the cause. Pray run slower, and I will follow slower. I am no clown, no rude peasant. Zeus is my father, and I am lord of Delphi and Tenedos, and know all things present and future. I am the god of song and the lyre. My arrows fly true to the mark; but alas! An arrow more fatal than my own has struck me in the heart! I am the god of medicine, I know all the virtues of all healing plants. Alas! I suffer a wound for which there is no cure!&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The nymph continues her flight, and left his plea half said. And even as she fled she charmed him. The wind blew her clothes, and her unbound hair streamed loose behind her. The god grew impatient to find his wooing and cooing thrown away, and, sped by Eros gained upon her in the race. It was like a hound pursuing a hare, with open jaws ready to seize, and while the feebler animal darts away, slipping from the very grasp. So flew the god and the virgin-he on the wings of love, and she on those of fear. The pursuer is the more rapid, however, and gains upon her, and his panting breath blows upon her hair. Her strength begins to fail, and, ready to sink to the ground, she calls upon her father the river god: &quot;Help me father! Open the earth to enclose me, or change my form, which has brought me into this danger!&quot; Scarcely able to utter that sentence, her limbs began to stiffen, her bosom began to be enclosed in a tender bark; her hair became leafed; her arms became branches; her foot stuck quick into the earth, as a root; her face became a treetop, retaining nothing of its former self but its beauty remained. Apollo stood amazed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He touched the stem, and felt the flesh tremble under the new bark. He embraced the branches and lavished kisses on the wood. The branches shrank from his lips. &quot;Since you cannot be my wife,&quot; he said&quot; you shall assuredly be my tree. I will wear you for my crown; I will decorate with you my harp and my quiver, and when the great Greek conquerors lead up the triumphal pomp to Athens, you shall be woven into the wreaths for their brows. And, as eternal youth is mine, you also shall be always green, and your leaf know no decay.&quot; The nymph, now changed into a laurel tee, bowed its branches in grateful acknowledgment.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Apollo's contributions to mortals was great. He viewed mortals as devolved forms of the gods themselves. Being the god of Medicine and religious healing, he taught humans to heal their wounds as well as their hearts. Armstrong, himself a physician, says this about Apollo:<br>
&quot;Music exalts each joy, allays each grief,<br>
Expels diseases, softens every pain;<br>
And hence the wise of ancient days adored<br>
One power of physic, melody, and song.&quot; <br>
<br>
Apollo was worshiped throughout all of the known world, at Delphi every four years they held the Pythian Games in his honor. He had many epithets, including &quot;Pythian Apollo,&quot; &quot;Apollo Apotropaeus&quot; meaning Apollo who averts all evil, and &quot;Apollo Nymphegetes&quot; meaning Apollo who looks after the Nymphs. He earned the title Smintheus or Sminthian (from sminthos, meaning rat) and as Parnopius or Parnopian (from parnops, meaning grasshopper).<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As the god of shepherds he also had the cult titles &quot;Lukeios&quot; a form of the work Lykos meaning wolf, by protection the flocks from wolfs, and &quot;Nomius&quot; meaning of pastures, belonging to shepherds. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Being the god of colonists, Apollo influenced his priests at Delphi to give divine guidance, as to where the expedition should proceed. That was during the height of the colonizing era. According to one legend, it was Apollo who helped either Cretan or Arcadian colonists found the city of Troy. This is why Artemis, Leto and Apollo sided with Troy during the Trojan War. Apollo is often called Helios, as Helios was a form of Apollo.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Apollo was also very evident in art, being the subject of many paintings, statues and monuments. He is always depicted as a handsome young man, clean shaven and carrying either a lyre, or his bow and arrows. There are many sculptures of Apollo and one of the most famous is in the central figure from the West pediment of the Temple of Zeus, at Olympia, showing Apollo declaring victory in favor of the Lapiths in their struggle against the Centaurs. One of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world, the Colossus of Rhodes, was actually a stature of Apollo. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The people of Rhodes were particularly fond of him and every year Rhodians as they were called, threw into the sea a chariot and four horses for the use of the Sun, apparently supposing that after riding a whole year across the sky his old chariot and horses must be worn out.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Apollo was patron to the city of Rhodes. The ancient writer Pindar calls Rhodes the Bride of the Sun, because it was the great seat of the worship of the Sun in ancient Greece. A Rhodian inscription of about 220 B. C records public prayers offered by the priests: &quot;To the Sun and Rhodes and all the other gods and goddesses and founders and heroes who have the city and the land of the Rhodians in their keeping.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Many festivals were placed in honor of Apollo. For instance in Delphi they held the Pythian Games, every four years. Also in Delphi was the octennial Delphic Stepterion, in which a boy reenacted the slaying of the Python.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Apollo was the kindest and most just of all the divinities upon Olympus. He was embraced by the mortals as a hero and a respected deity. Son of the all mighty Zeus, and the Titaness Leto, brother to Artemis who delights in arrows. God of many names as well as many things. It seems that Apollo will just continue to amaze and to work himself into the hearts of mortals for all of time. His awsome deeds, from introducing healing to humans, to riding the sun through the sky, will go on being remembered forever. His beauty and majesty is timeless, his heart and soul knows of no bounds Forever he is continue to touch to hearts of immortal and man. The legend of The Great Apollo will forever burn in the hearts of all.<br>
