And besides with the sudden attack from one of the Queen of the Gods minions, it was obviously time to get the Pleiade home to Mount Cyllene.  Where she could be safe from Hera and her minions.  But, still they had a long journey ahead of them.<br>
After feeling it safe, Hercules slowed their walk down and relaxed a bit.  His blue eyes drifted to Maia as they walked. &quot;So, why is Hera so intent on getting you this time?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/umaiathepleiade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maia the Pleiade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(7/5/01 6:24:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> To escape Hera</span><hr size=1> As the slowed down, Maia caught her breath and looked up at Hercules.

She pushed back a long silken wavy tendril from her cheek and walked slowely along with Hercules.<br>
&quot;Hercules, I have given Zeus an offspring.  That is what I have done. Hermes,&quot; she smiled as she thought of her son. &quot;He is now the Messenger God of Olympus and the Underworld.  I have made Zeus very proud.  That is what I have done.&quot; <br>
Even though the most beautiful of the Pleiades, her face was now a bit tired as she looked in front of her.  Even as a Titaness, she did not have the powers of the Olympians or other immortals.

And like Hermes and Maia, Hercules was quickly one of those who Hera tormented.  He knew that they had to get Maia home as soon as possible.  Before Hera's minions caught up with them.<br>
&quot;Maia, I know you feel you love Zeus,&quot; he sighed as he spoke, keeping his pace along the road steady. &quot;But, you know Hera's wrath.  I believe you have already come close to tasting it before.&quot;<br>

Maia walked over to Aphrodite and gently touched her forearm.  With a slight smile, Maia spoke to her, &quot;Aphrodite, thank you very much for the information.

These were definitely two deitites that he definitely did not want to mess with.  <br>
<br>
Hermes had been pacing back and forth in his room,  worried about his mother's safety.  He had been using a scrying crystal to monitor his mother's escape.  Up till now, everything had been going well.  But he knew that not far away, Hera's huntress, the Lioness was on the prowl.<br>
<br>
But Hermes wasn't going to let his mother suffer because of him.  Hermes had already set wards around Mt. Olympus, and he would therefore be alerted whenever anyone mentioned his mother's or Hercules's name.  He had sent out serpents, symbols of his office, to further monitor his mother's movements.  He had to do everything quietly, in case Hera became angered at his or anyone else's attempts at thwarting her.<br>
<br>
As Hermes paced in his room, the wards around Mt. Olympus was triggered.  Waving a hand over the scrying crystal, the image changed, and the image depicted that of a strange man who was in the middle of conversing with Aphrodite.  Not knowing whether this was a good or bad portent, Hermes quickly flew out of his window towards the enigma.  He had to make ensure his mother's safety.<br>
