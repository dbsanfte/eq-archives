she said softly, words spoken to the quiet, ever watchful trees.

<br>
With a drawn out sigh she roughly patted the horses neck and leaned in to confide in the bay colored beast...&quot;I think perhaps, I am beginning to hate Athens...&quot;  The vixen grinned briefly to herself before hauling a still tired body up into the saddle.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Here we go again...&quot;  She murmured to the light bodied mare before heels connected with dark flanks and the young, excitable creature leapt forward to the trail.  She didn't allow herself to think, she couldn't...Instead she rode, knowing only the pounding rhythm of the horse beneath her and the passing blur of trees as she flew by. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=righteousrevenge>RighteousRevenge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#993300>(11/19/02 1:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=373.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fortunecity.com/rivendell/chronos/478/untit.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Harbor</span><hr size=1>     The dark robed huntress slid along the docks in the grey early light of dawn.  Careful, measured footfalls guided her around offending bins and barrels of fish and refuse.  The salty air and the early morning clamor of boats docking and departing brought sensative senses to bristling alertness.<br>
<br>
    She swept through the  grey mist, a figure barely noticed in passing, until keen ice eyes fell upon a familiar form.  The captain of a merchant vessel who had agreed to her fair passage the night before, in a tumbled down old tavern, over a few too many mugs of port.<br>
<br>
    A small leather pouch, bearing a promised weight of coins, flickered almost magically into the vixen's fingers.  That same pouch was dangled tantalizingly before the rummy eyes of a long weathered captain.  &quot;As promised.&quot;  The vixen's words froze through the distracting din and pressed upon the captain's ears as only a demanding whisper.  Coins and pouch were carelessly dropped into the captain's over-eager palms and the vixen slid away, leaving an entranced captain staring after her.<br>
<br>
    The older man, long worn by the sea, took a moment to measure the coins between calloused and sun-beaten hands, sure enough it was as promised.  A stoic stare fixed on the vixen's form, just a dark cloak, slipping hauntingly up his gangplank in the early dawn's grey mist.  Coins carefully secreted away to a pocket, he scratched tentatively  at one white eyebrow, surely the wild-eyed huntress had only been last night's port induced dream?  Silent and mystified he swaggered down the dock to see to his vessel's final preparations.  The sun's caress over a watery horizon would set sail his small ship to Aegina. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=righteousrevenge>RighteousRevenge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#993300>(11/24/02 2:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=373.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fortunecity.com/rivendell/chronos/478/untit.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Suffering the Sea</span><hr size=1>      The wild-eyed stranger and her sulky horse in the hold had become quite the controversy aboard the small vessel.  The crew felt certain disease about the shifty-eyed woman and kept her carefully apart as they went about their duties.  The old weathered captain felt much the same, the tall stranger seemed almost unearthly as she drifted aimlessly across the deck.<br>
<br>
     Lilith knew precisely what the crew thought about her and did her best to cultivate the image.  The last thing she wanted was some foul-breathed sailor breathing down her neck when she had more important things on her mind.  The vastness of water around her absorbed both thoughts and emotions and finally allowed her to slip down into the hold where her horse continued to dance and bicker its complaints to the situation.<br>
<br>
     Careful, steady hands brushed across the grey-coated mare's nose, offering silent comfort to the nervous and frustrated beast.  Patient moments past before the young mare settled and the vixen settled herself on the straw.  Dark cloak huddled about her form, icy-eyes darting about the dark and shifting hold, taking account of every shadowed corner.  Finally the wildcat vixen steadied tensed nerves and shut wild eyes.  Like a cat stuck out in the rain, she was miserable, but there was a task at hand and she would do all that was necessary to complete it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=righteousrevenge>RighteousRevenge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#993300>(11/27/02 3:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=373.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fortunecity.com/rivendell/chronos/478/untit.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Aegina</span><hr size=1> The vixen's relief could not have been greater when the small vessel collided less than gracefully with the water-worn dock.  Her relief was not long lived, for the moment she stepped off that boat, she would be presented with a fresh set of problems.  So she relished in the moment, watching the crew scuttle about in preparation for unloading the water craft.<br>
<br>
Late afternoon soon faded to the golden-red hues of dusk, all under the ice-eyed vixen's gaze.  The insane bustle of docking and unloading had slowed and the vixen left her post to attend her long impatient horse, thoroughly frustrated by its confinement.  The grey mare voiced her relief with an explosive neigh the second dark hooves touched the top deck.<br>
<br>
With only a few struggles and protests, the vixen and her mount settled on solid ground once more.  The port was alive with merchants and sailors, all trying to complete the final tasks of the day.  The huntress steered clear from the commotion as much as possible, picking her way cautiously through the human littered streets.  Darkness continued to press in upon the seldom noticed pair as they wove along through the crowds, guided by the broken directions of questioned strangers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=righteousrevenge>RighteousRevenge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#993300>(12/3/02 7:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=373.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fortunecity.com/rivendell/chronos/478/untit.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> In The Alleys</span><hr size=1> A light rain had started to fall across already dismal streets and the disagreeable vixen sunk further into her dark cloak.  She slid uneasily through the bustling mob of commoners now fleeing the rainy markets.  A side alley provided some temporary relief from the rushed masses, but not from the irritatingly cold rain, hadn't she endured enough water?<br>
<br>
A seemingly clumsy passerby bumped carelessly into the vixen, eliciting a menacing growl from the creature's throat.  With a low snort the huntress vented her frustrations which were quickly refueled when her coin pouch was discovered missing.  With almost animalistic rage she spun back down the alley, ice eyes locking on her intended victim as he fled toward the darkness.  He may have been fast, but she was faster yet.  All the frustrations and irritations of her journey were unleashed upon the unlucky pickpocket.<br>
<br>
Seeing he was already at great disadvantage, the damaged pickpocket gave a helpless yell.  A yell that unfortunately enough attracted the attention of several city guards.  Seeing her own disadvantage, the huntress backed away and disappeared further into the darkness.  Hidden in the shadows of a low-hanging rooftop, the vixen watched the ongoings unfold with stoic attentiveness.<br>
<br>
&quot;He went that way.&quot;  the slimy pickpocket pointed off down the dark alley.  Several guards pointlessly charged off in the indicated direction, leaving the alley quiet for only a moment.  The word &quot;he&quot; tickled the vixen's ears and a slow grin slipped across her features.  She would simply become the opposite of which they searched for.  A dark hood slipped away from distinctly feminine features and the huntress stepped unconcerned into the rainy streets once more.  The final rays of light slipped away across the horizon just as the vixen slipped across the threshold of the Laughing Dolphin Inn. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=righteousrevenge>RighteousRevenge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#993300>(12/11/02 9:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=373.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fortunecity.com/rivendell/chronos/478/untit.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Inn</span><hr size=1> Simply stepping into the inn started to warm the cold from her skin.  A heavy cloak was readily discarded, sending a sheet of raindrops to the floor.  Worm ice eyes glanced briefly back out the rainy windows, sending her silent curse at the rain soaked streets.<br>
<br>
Once more the vixen turned her attention to the inn's interior.  She hardly bothered to notice the inn's occupants, regardless of the way some stared at her.  She took in only enough of her surroundings to navigate her way to the bar.<br>
<br>
The inn seemed busy for now, crowded with rain weary patrons, seeking an evening's meal.  The huntress had no intention of dealing with the rush of customers, so she sank to a quiet seat at the far corner of the bar.  She managed to catch the tender's attention for only long enough to receive her desired drink.<br>
<br>
Drink in hand, she settled back into the quiet of her mind.  Icy eyes finally took the time to observe the ongoings of the inn's patrons.  Slowly the water warmed off her grateful form and the inn quieted as night settled heavy on the town.   The vixen had waited and watched in stoic silence as the inn settled, the busy crowd fleeing and leaving only a few quite patrons.  Finally the task at hand reappeared in her mind and with some distant form of determination, she approached the bartender. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0
