<br>
As he watched his brother playing among the mortals, he could not help but smile.  Apparently things in the realm of the sea had grown boring and Poseidon was in need of some recreation.

Nothing was about to stop this Amazon Queen . . . <br>
<br>
Until she saw it. Hippolyte.<br>
<br>
&quot;No!&quot; She screamed as memories of past wars flooded her mind. She remembered when she lost Hippolyte once before. Her eyes turned and she saw Hera in the distance. She sighed lightly knowing Hera would watch over her athelfi.<br>
<br>
Alysia turned once more and caught sight of Fogstone sending that blasted Dragon off once more, and before the beast got anywhere near the Northern Lands, Alysia's wolves were there defending the lands.<br>
<br>
The Queen chanted a few words of the ancients and Atmah Cyane leaned her hand out placing a sheild around the sacred village that no man or beast could enter through.<br>
<br>
(Yeah see, seeing that I claim Scynthia, I'm not about to let it get burned down by a freakin Dragon. Sorry but those were not the rules of this war.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Her eyes turned once more and sawn Dawn in the distance. As she fought, she kept her eyes open upon her best friend. Sadly, she wished Livia was there fighting along side her.

His face curled in disgust, the mist tasted like bull....never mind. His head shot up as he heard the shrill cries of Hecate's dragons flying off into the afternoon sky. His eyes narrowed as he saw her mouth begin moving. A spell, surely she couldn't go one battle without one. That just wouldn't be Hecate.<br>
<br>
Apollo's body fell into attack position as his eyes shot around looking for some kind of thing to fight. Some kind of puppet of which Hecate would be master. Apollo's head turned to the left, then the right looking for some kind of mystical attacker. He found nothing. As his head turned to in front of him as a huge stalagmite fell before him, just missing his head. Apollo stumbled back as more stalagmites fell from the bottom of her ebony chariot.<br>
<br>
Jump left. Jump right. Flip back. Apollo managed to evade some of the death spikes. He flipped back and lost his footing. He slipped slamming onto his chest. Apollo spat the mud from his mouth and tried to whip it from his face, only managing to smear it. As he was getting up another one fell from the sky, luckily he rolled out of its way and stood up. Apollo jumped out of the way of another falling spike, but landed right into the line of fire for another.<br>
<br>
It sliced through the arm of his armor. Apollo's eyes widened as he looked at the gash. His eyes glazed over with rage as his gaze lifted to Hecate. Jumping into the air he called out for assistance:<br>
<br>
&quot;PELIDEUS!!!&quot; he shouted the name of his winged griffin. Just as another spike fell to the earth, Apollo was swept into the air by the winged beast. Pelideus shrieked as he ripped through the sky towards the chariot of Hecate. The griffin brought Apollo as close as he could to Hecate's death chariot. Apollo stood up, steadying himself and jumped for it.<br>
<br>
As Apollo pulled himself onboard the chariot, Pelideus flew up front and attacked her dragons. Finally in the chariot Apollo narrowed his eyes at Hecate.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's not play dirty...Silver-footed Nurse...&quot;<br>
<br>
Apollo smirked drawing once again his sword. He was ready to actually fight Hecate, hopefully she would not run away this time. The chariot began to plunge towards earth as her dragons were distracted from keeping the chariot in the air. It was going to get very interesting, very soon.<br>

Hecate°·•·</span><hr size=1> Apollo's face stung as Hecate's nail's dug into them. His eye began to twitch. THAT....SHREW!!! She dared to touch his masterpiece of a face? His most treasured posession? Oooo she was going to get it now!<br>
<br>
Apollo's face then swung to the left as his other, still perfect, cheek was slapped...and HARD. Apollo almost tripped out of the chariot, but caught his footing. A hand raised to his cheek. He was too outraged to notice the outrageous smell. The twitch in his right eye grew worse as he realized the pure and excessive amount of audacity had by Hecate. Short tempered bitc...he was getting distracted.<br>
<br>
Within the grace and perfection of a hawk diving for its pray, Apollo raised his sword and plunged it into the stomach of Hecate. Not only did he plunge the sword in, he twisted it to add to her pain. He then grabbed her by the collar of her &quot;outfit&quot;( if you want to call that hideous gathering of mismatched fabrics an outfit). He gritted his teeth and practically growled.<br>
<br>
&quot;How dare you!&quot; he pushed her over the side of the chariot so she was sure to lose her balance. The only thing keeping her from falling his him holding onto her collar...oh yes, and the sword in her stomach.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will NOT, allow you to do such things to me, no matter who the hell you THINK you are. No matter what &quot;magical, whimsical, and menacing&quot; spell you can conjure up in that SICK mind of yours, you will NEVER disrespect me like that again. The matter in which you fight is despicable and uncalled for.&quot; Apollo narrowed his twitching eye at her.<br>
<br>
Grasping the grip on his sword he plunged the sword in deeper. The blood dripped from his crimson-stained cheek onto the handle of the sword.<br>
<br>
&quot;You...you....MY FACE!&quot; Apollo shrieked so loud it probably brought pain to the ears of Zeus.<br>
<br>
Apollo grew tired of this stupidity. He knew that no words, or any action of his would get through to Hecate. She was one of the most close minded, and intentionally impersonable goddesses in the Olympic family (after Eris that is). There was no use in continuing this, she could not be killed, and she would remain blinded by her ignorance for all eternity.<br>
<br>
His eyes rolled to her. He was ashamed to say the least. Gripping the collar tighter he pulled her up, allowing her to stand. Shaking his head, he pulled the sword from her stomach and whipped the blood upon her clothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't bother me anymore Hecate. I haven't the time to waste on you any longer.&quot; was all he said before whistling to Pedieus. His stare was perhaps as Hades'. He seemed to stare through her. Apollo jumped into the air just as the griffin flew by to catch him. He ripped through the air towards the ground not even bothering to peer at the look Hecate most obviously had upon her face. She was unimportant now. He needed to let his rage settle before he was to deal with her again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uxxdemeterxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xxDemeterxx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/23/01 1:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=174>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Not so fast</span><hr size=1> :*: Demeter watched from the sideline, true, she didnt want to get involved,she didnt want to pick sides, but she didsay she wanted to help eiter side if needed, and since it seemd her pettykin were doing so well, she helped Varia.

She moves her neck from side to side,popping it,then stands back up and seeing everyone by now is pre-occupied...she just happens to go into a frenzy now....<br>
<br>
With a growl,her body tenses up,and suddenly she goes into complete transformation. Her entire body becomes encased in those deadly spikes,her usually soft,tan skin becomes rough and pale grey,her eyes turning from green to grey. A transparent second eye lid covering her eyes to dull out any bright lights.She becomes completely un-reckognizable with this change.<br>
<br>
With no notion of who are her friends,allies or enemies. In this case,everyone was her enemy.<br>
<br>
With low incoherent mummbles she runs into the actions,her arms slashing to and fro,those long spike on her arms slicing through soldiers AND amazons,killing them quickly or just causing painful wounds.<br>
<br>
She comes face to face with a large soldier and suddenly rushes at him,her hands out infront of her,as her hands are clentched into fists. And as she come mear inches from him 4,5 inch spike petrude from her nuckles on both fists. She jams these spikes into his chest,then with little effort she lifts him off the ground,bringing her arms up quickly she throws the soldier over her back,not bothering to look back to see if he were dead.<br>
<br>
She then turns quickly to the left,as someone catches her sences.An Amazon. Not careing who it is,she quickly brings her arms up,then down sending those spikes from her wrists down into the Amazons chest,causing the amazon to gasp and fall quickly to her knees. As the amazon falls,Zelia yanks her arms across,causing her spikes to slice open the amazons chest. As the amazon falls dead,she pulls her spikes back,then takes off to find more prey.<br>
