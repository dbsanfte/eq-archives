<br>
MOGodofWar: :::He stood by a tree, unable for her to see him, watching her as she sat.:::<br>
<br>
Melousa: :::Unaware of him watching her, Melousa lay on the grass by the river, rolling onto her stomach, her hands dipped into the cold water. A playfull fish came and snipped at her hand, thinking she was food. She laughed at the nibble.:::<br>
<br>
MOGodofWar: :::Stepping out from behind the tree, he became visable to all around him. He walked over to where Melousa lay and stood besides her, looking out to the water.:::<br>
<br>
Melousa: :::She saw a shadow form besides her, rolling over she looked up, her face a mask of calm, inside, her stomach knoted, her heart began to pound wildly. Ares had this effect on her since she was very young.::: What are you doing here Ares?<br>
<br>
MOGodofWar: ::looking down at her he stared blankfaced, this was something he had to do:: I am worried about the fate of the Lesvos Amazons Melousa.<br>
<br>
Melousa: ::She sat up and got to her feet, brushing grass from her skirt she looked at him.::: What are you talking about? Is there somethig wrong with Velaska?  ::If something had happened to her mother, she wouldnt know what to do.::<br>
<br>
MOGodofWar:  ::he shook his head:: No, no, Velaska is her usual mean self. I am talking about its future Melousa. It has no future. ::He looked at her, his glare was icy.::<br>
<br>
Melousa: It will be fine. ::She looked at him and took a step back, there was something in his eyes that frightened her.:: Why would you think it has no future?<br>
<br>
MOGodofWar: You know full well that Lesvos has no legal heir to the throne. Not since Kyme gave birth to Velaska has an heir exsisted, and I know for a fact, that Velaska will not let me give her a child.<br>
<br>
Melousa: ::a chuckle came from her lips:: Your right about that, she would fight you tooth and nail, shes immortal, like you, you reared her, it would be one heck of a fight to watch.<br>
<br>
MOGodofWar: I reared you, but not to be insulting Melousa, you are no match for me as of yet. You can have a child for me, you can save the Lesvos Amazons. ::His hand grasped her upper arm.::<br>
<br>
Melousa: ::tring to pull from his grasp.:: Are you mad? Have your child? Thats so not going to happen. ::she gave an unsuccessfull pull of her arm.::<br>
<br>
MOGodofWar:  ::His grasp got tighter as she began to pull away from him, he pulled her towards him so that her back was to his front, wrapping an arm around her middle.:: It needs to be you Melousa, that Tasha is blinded by Circe, you would atleast show that child a happy home until she is old enough for my training, then I will give her back, and when Velaska steps down, she can be masked as Queen.<br>
<br>
Melousa: ::She slammed the heel of her foot on his toes and as his grip loosened a bit, she tried to make a mad dash for it.<br>
<br>
MOGodofWar:  ::As she stepped on his toes, it caught him by surprise, which was odd for Ares, nothing ever caught him off guard. Melousa slipped through his grasp and he watched her run off. He smiled and laughed darkly, as he began to walk after her, he fizzeled into a blue glow, appearing not even 5 feet away from Melousa, she practically ran right into his arms. Catching her he looked at her with a grin.:: &quot;I win.&quot; ::with that, they both vanished in a blue light.::<br>

She had been quietly picking mushrooms from the dark forests, when she heard the sound.  Alexiares quickly darted behind a tree and looked towards the coming sound.  Then suddenly Ares appeared in a flash.  Before she knew it, Alexiares saw an amazon run right into his arms.  But, it looked as if she did it be accident.  For there was fear on her face.  She tried to call out to the amazon, but they both dissappeared in a flash.  <br>
<br>
Alexiares ran over to the spot, but there was nothing there but crushed grass.  No, she whispered to herself.  Why did Ares take the amazon?  There was no time to question.<br>
<br>
She spun on her heals and quickly ran back towards the city.  Running thru the gates, those in the city could see a bit of fear in her own features.  Alexiares ran quickly to the post that held one a horn to call out in danger.  Picking it up, she sounded the horn as loud as she could. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vasilissadelerium>Vasilissa De Lerium</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Vasilissa Apo Themiscrya</span><br>  Posts: 127<br> <font color=#993300>(5/22/03 8:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=484.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/deleriuml9/images/del2.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abduction of Melousa</span><hr size=1> :: DeL was in her hut reading her scrolls carefully, suddenly, as the sound of the horn played, she jumped , getting to her feet and running out the door.

Were the Romans invading, the centaurs invading....She ran to the one she saw by the horn, who had to of blown in it.::<br>
