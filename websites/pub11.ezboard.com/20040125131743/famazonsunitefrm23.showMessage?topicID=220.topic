The trees swayed and threatened to fall down and the snow that was already on the ground was ever increasing and rose about a 3 feet high. Glistening and frigid the snow was still beautiful to behold esspecially from the summits of Olympus. Back and forth the winf wipped the falling snow about so that in some places snow dunes formed. <br>
<br>
Warmth and radiant light bathe the home of the immortals as the mortals on earth have never beheld. Poseidon looks froma large terrace down on the lands of greece and the snowfall has him in a thrall. In some places it comes down harder than others. He spots a lone mortal woman of exceptional beauty below fighting the torrentous snow with barely no protection. A sparked emotion bids him show some mercy for the poor soul and lend a helping hand. Poseidon hops over the golden terrace and falls down to the earth below.<br>
<br>
About Atalanta the snow ceases and the wind calms down but not completely. A bright light seems to fall from the sky and into her midst and lo and behold an eagle of large stature glides with ease into the soft snow and stares up at her with its huge black eyes. It enfolds its outstretched wings and a bright green blinding flash comes from nowhere. The eagle is turned back to the lord Poseidon. His golden sandles do not sink into the snow beneath his weight and his crimson cloak blows back in the wind along with his brown locks. A crown of gold sits on his large head and a tunic reaching down to his knees of the purest white falls gently off his strong shoulders. His demeanor is jovial and he stands straight with his hnds folded behind his back. He carefully observes Atalanta before deciding to speak.<br>
<br>
'All caught up in the storm and I'm guessing far away from home. By what chance am I to find a woman such as you and so scantily clad in this severest of conditions? Need I beg you come with me to a place where you can be free of this biting cold or would pride becon you to continue along and forsake the help of a god?'<br>
<br>
He reaches out with his open right hand to her awaiting her to take hold of it.<br>
<br>
'Come choose swiftly for I am a god of little patience.'<br>
<br>
His smile grows larger as the wind slowly begins to pick up and he snow to fall about again before them. <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uxxatalantaxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xx Atalanta xx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(12/25/01 2:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=220.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/cristalc15/images/ali3.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wandering the lands</span><hr size=1> Atalanta looked up and smiled. ~Impatience is unbecoming of a deity such as yourself, Poseidon...~<br>

The snow falls violently around them as it did before and a warmth envelopes the two beings. <br>
<br>
Lights fall on them from a hearth in a small room made entirely of white washed stone. An iron gate stands at the hearth with a bronze fork leaning on the wall beside it. A window adjacent to the hearth at its right and another straight ahead of the hearth look into the wilderness surrounding the cottage. The windows are draped with grey shades and a door made of tightly thatched wooden boards lies next to the window adjacent to the hearth with an oval rug made of black wool before it. Two love seats opposite one another are turned slightly toward the hearth and face each other. They are made of thick, soft cushions of grey tone. Behind the seats, right underneath the other window is a small rectangular table for 4 but the other longer end of it is pushed up into the wall. 3 chairs are neatly pushed under the table and a cylindrical candle made of red wax is lit. Opposite the door and adjecent to the hearth on its left is a mattress with a feather pillow and layed out comforters.<br>
<br>
Poseidon looks down at Atalanta and smiles at her. He releases her from his grasp and stands silently looking at her. At last he speaks.<br>
<br>
'You can do away with that cloak now and enjoy the warmth of this place. We are still in the same place but I've given this shelter to you till the storm calms. Here, let me take your cloak.' <br>
<br>
He holds out his hand to take her cloak and stares at her with a penetrating gaze his thoughts being his own to ponder at. <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=hypnos>Hypnos </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://klinikendortmund.de/kliniken+institute/anaesthesie/hypnos.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 266<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(12/27/01 11:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=220.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wandering the lands</span><hr size=1> ***Outside in the blustering snow storm Hypnos stands wearing a large white wool hooded cloak.

He looks back to Atalanta and the cracks open the door open as he peers through. The snow blows in and melts on the floor and the fire threatens to go out in the hearth. Before him stands the imposing god of War and the sea king looks at him with a hard gaze.<br>

The floor is now littered with broken wood here and there and the god screams out so loud the foundations of the house tremble.<br>
<br>
&quot;WHAT, WHAT JUST HAPPENED I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS.&quot;<br>
<br>
Quickly regaining his composure Poseidon speaks to Atalanta. <br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry about that little inconvenience, I've done what I can for you Atalanta and stay here till the storm abates if you will. There are supplies and food in the back room that will last a few days and of course you've Ares here to keep you company if he so desires.&quot;<br>
<br>
He turns to Ares with a hard gaze.<br>
<br>
&quot;Enjoy yourself.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then looking back to the place where Hecate vanished regretably he lowers his head in humility as he wishes he had been a little clearer to Hecate who took him wrong. <br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, would that her temper were not as hot as mine own.&quot;<br>
<br>
A bright light fills the room, its source from Poseidon and the god leaves Atalanta to the hands of &quot;Mad&quot; Ares. <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uxxatalantaxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xx Atalanta xx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(1/25/02 4:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=220.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ?</span><hr size=1> Atalanta just kind of shook her head to clear it after Poseidon vanished.
