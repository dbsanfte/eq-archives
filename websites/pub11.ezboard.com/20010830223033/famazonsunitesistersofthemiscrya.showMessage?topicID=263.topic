She smiled to herself and flipped the dagger over in her hand a few times.  It was to be a present to Ainia.  After she had the baby, Quinn was sure Ainia would be out in the wilds again hunting - An activity that the blonde woman loved.  <br>
      Arriving at their shared hut, she quietly pushed the door open just a bit to see if her bondmate was home.  Not hearing a sound, she pushed the door open all the way and made her way inside.  Stopping instantly, she noticed a candle was lit on the table and the fire was still going in the fireplace.  It wasn't like Ainia to leave the hut with these things still lit. <br>
      She stood stock-still using her warrior senses to take in the whole hut.  Finally detecting a rather medicinal smell, she cocked her head to the side, trying to remember where she had smelt it before.  It finally came to her - willowbark tea.  It was something Ainia had been using as of late, for the pre-contractions she had been having.  Green eyes widened and she moved around the table spotting Ainia out cold on the floor.  Quinn's heart seized for a quick second and then she was on her knees pulling Ainia up to her chest, cradling her closely. <br>
      &quot;Sweetheart, wake up.&quot;  She waited what seemed like hours but was only several long moments until Ainia stirred and stretched, then gave a low hiss of pain.  Quinn was grateful that her bondmate was alive and let out a breath she had been holding before she could will herself to speak, &quot;Ar..are you okay?  Please, talk to me.&quot; <br>
      Ainia took a few shallow breaths and pushed out,  &quot;Hurts.&quot;  her hand going to her stomach automatically to check for the rather constant kicks she had been receiving.  <br>
      Quinn was on the verge of panic at this point and asked, &quot;Th...the baby?&quot;  <br>
      Ainia looked up at Quinn, tears in her eyes and said, &quot;I don't know.  I can still feel her kicking though.&quot;  she ground out.  <br>
      Quinn took a steadying breath and nodded, getting a rather determined look on her face, &quot;I need to get you to the healers.&quot;  Ainia nodded, <br>
      &quot;I think I can stand.&quot;  Quinn wasn't about to let that happen and voiced it,  <br>
      &quot;Absolutely not, I'll carry you over.&quot;  Ainia set a hand on Quinn's arm and looked up at her, <br>
      &quot;Quinn, I don't weigh much less then you, at least not now.&quot;  Quinn's green eyes narrowed, <br>
      &quot;Are you saying I can't handle lifting you?&quot;  Ainia actually chuckled through her pain at the look on Quinn's face and that remark.<br>
      &quot;Warrior ego, all I'm saying is listen to your body, I don't want you getting hurt either.&quot;  Quinn couldn't help herself and she leaned down and kissed Ainia softly and smiled, <br>
      &quot;Trust me, you have my adrenaline pumping  so much right now I could pick up a hut and carry it around.&quot;  She slipped one arm under Ainia's knees and then another around her shoulders and lifted the blonde slowly.  Ainia put an arm around Quinn's neck and tucked her head in, trying to make it a little easier on Quinn.  Quinn steadied herself and kissed the top of Ainia's head.  &quot;You just hold on, I'll get you to the healers hut.&quot;  She felt a slight nod and then Ainia whispered, <br>
      &quot;Quinn, if she needs to be cut out.&quot;  Quinn cut her off with a growl.<br>
      &quot;Don't even say that, it's going to be fine.&quot;  She went as quickly as she could across the compound, trying not to jostle the precious cargo in her arms.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uwarriorquinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WarriorQuinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#993300>(8/6/01 9:59:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=263.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Complications--The Birth</span><hr size=1>      Quinn burst through the doors of the healers up, a little bit frantic at this point, having run through the gamet of emotions.  Looking around she didn't spot anyone at first.  Raising her voice, &quot;Help, I need some help here.&quot;  Leaning over she kissed Ainia's sweaty brow.  With a whisper, &quot;It's going to be just fine, love.  I promise.&quot;  <br>
