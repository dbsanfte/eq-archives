She was trying to save what supplies she collected for her athelfi back home.  She sat by the fire and pulled out her scrolls.  She began writing furiously, wanting to write down the rest of her story while it was fresh in her mind::<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Ombie swung his axe before I had a chance to draw my sword.  He hit me with the flat of the axe, knocking me to the ground.  From my position on my back I kicked upwards, landing a blow to the short man's stomach.  I could hear the wind rush from him, but he only stepped back a pace.  He grinned as he gasped to catch his breath.  I hopped to my feet and pulled my sword from it's scabbard.  The old man laughed, knocking the sword from my hand with one blow.  Eyes wide, I quickly pulled my dagger from my belt and flung it into the man's leg.  He only frowned, leaving it there!  <br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, girlie, you're getting a little rough for ole Ombie.&quot;<br>
<br>
He slashed my right side with his axe.  I staggered back, holding my abdomen.  I looked around for another weapon, but the little man was too quick.  He smacked me in the wounded side with the flat of his axe, causing me to double over.  As I bent over, the air rushing from me, he smacked me in the forehead.  I hit the ground, blood running into my eyes.  I started to pull myself up, but everything went black.  The last thing I heard was, &quot;Aye, come on lassie, I didn't hit ye hard.&quot;<br>
<br>
I woke up in one of the rooms of the inn.  My side had been bandaged - a pungent smelling salve applied to it.  I hopped up, throwing my armor and furs back on.  I grabbed my weapons and quickly went downstairs to the bar, asking the keeper what happened.  <br>
<br>
She laughed, &quot;The dwarf got you a room and took you upstairs.  He bandaged your side and forehead then left.&quot;<br>
<br>
I stood there, puzzled.  I thanked the keeper and ran outside, looking around for the dwarf.  But he was gone.  I went over to mount Zephyur, taking off to find a cart for the supplies.  As I climbed on his back I noticed the two wineskins that had been put on my horse's saddle bags.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
::Nicodema laughed as she recalled the story.  She rubbed her hands together for a moment, then finished::<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   I looked around the village, but never did find him.  I guess they're not all bad...strange, but not bad.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
::She put her scrolls away and threw her mittens on.  Then walked over to Zephyur, rubbing him down, and climbed aboard.  She pulled the reins and motioned to the next human village, hoping they would have a cart she could get for hauling supplies home:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub74.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=nicodemaalcinoe>Nicodema Alcinoe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#993300>(2/20/01 10:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Alexander the not-so-great</span><hr size=1> ::Nicodema stood outside the tavern and stared at the sign.  How odd these people are:  they need taverns to announce that all are welcome?  <br>
<br>
She dismounted Zephyur and walked in, pulling her mittens off.  She started to lay her hand across the hilt of her sword - that comforting gesture that was more habit than threat - but immeadiately remembered that they see this as an invitation to fight.  She walked to the bar, looking around at the people.  All eyes seemed to be on the tall Amazon woman.  She pulled back her fur hood as the barkeep walked over.::<br>
<br>
&quot;Cider, please.&quot;<br>
<br>
The keep filled a mug and handed it to her.  the proper money was exchanged, and she sat down.  As she sipped the cider she scanned the crowd.  The open area of the bar where all the tables were was at her left, and that's where her gaze fell.  She hadn't noticed the man on her right.<br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Alexander,&quot; the pale, skinny man offered.  <br>
<br>
She was startled, but made no outward appearance of it.  She turned slowly to look him over.  He was not entirely without merit, but obviously to Nico no threat.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Good day,&quot;  she went back to her cider.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're new?&quot;  He offered.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm just a traveller,&quot;  then she had a thought, &quot;Do you know of a place that would sell carts?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot;  he offered, quietly, &quot;But the town over from here, in the valley, has a man named Ironthos.  He sells horses, carts...and he's a blacksmith, &quot; he smiled - obviously proud that he could help.<br>
<br>
She nodded, &quot;Thank you.&quot;  With that she finished her cider off and walked out.<br>
<br>
The young girl walked to her horse.  As she pulled her hood up and mittens on she heard the tavern door open and shut, and footsteps crunching in the snow.  She didn't turn to look, thinking the person was of no consequence.  She mounted the horse and rode off for the town this Alexander had mentioned.<br>
<br>
As she rode she heard the obvious footsteps behind her.  She was slightly amused:  how threatening can a person be if they can't even hide their footfalls?  She continued riding, coming to a forest at the edge of the city.  She rode stopped in the first clearing, letting Zephyur rest and giving him water.  As she patted his neck, she said aloud with a smirk, &quot;Just come out and we'll discuss what it is you're following me for.&quot;<br>
<br>
The pale, gangly man from the tavern appeared from behind a fallen tree.  He frowned, &quot;You heard me, eh?&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled, &quot;Only...a LOT.  You're not much of a hunter with footsteps like that, are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
He shook his head, &quot;That is what I would like to talk to you about.  I'm not very...hmm...athletic.  As you say, I'm not a hunter.  But I would like to learn.  Will you teach me?&quot;<br>
<br>
She laughed, not trying to be mean, but...if he only knew!  She was a young Amazon, barely out of training herself.  Taking an apprentice...and a MALE at that, was hilarious to her.<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; was her simple answer. She got back on her steed and motioned a half-hearted &quot;good bye&quot; to the sick-looking male as she began riding again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please!  I can pay you!&quot;  <br>
<br>
She shook her head and mumbled, &quot;Men.  You just don't get it.&quot;<br>
<br>
She continued riding, leaving the male behind. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=nicodemaalcinoe>Nicodema Alcinoe</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://members.aol.com/xnicodemax/images/nicodmea.jpg BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#993300>(2/26/01 1:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ironthos, the Blacksmith</span><hr size=1> ::Nico wandered into the village the pale, skinny man pointed her towards.  It was small, relatively busy.  She found the metalworker's shop easily enough.  She slid off of her horse and went inside.  It was heaven!!!!  The fire was blaring and she had to practically strip all her clothes off for it's heat.  She smiled huge and pulled her mittens and cloak off.::<br>
<br>
::A large, black man came out from a smaller room in the back;  he gave a deep laugh::  Yeah, everyone likes it in here in the winter, but in the summer I'm all alone!  ::He smiled, a nice, warm smile:: What can I help you with, little lady?<br>
<br>
::Nico tilted her head, not having been called that since before her mother died when she was nine.::  Well, sir.  I need a cart.<br>
<br>
::The man frowned.:: I'm sorry.  I have none.  The only one with any carts is over there.  ::He scowled as he motioned to a large stable across the dirt road:: Braedon.  ::He shook his head::  Not a nice man, lass.  I hope you have a lot of money. <br>

::The Amazon frowned:: Umm...money?  N-no...how do I get some?<br>

::The large blacksmith's belly shook with laughter::  Work for it.  But you don't want to work for him...goodness.  He'd turn you into a slave.  If I were you, I'd try for another town.  There's one on the other side of the mountain.  It's a two day journey, but I'm sure a young one like you will have no problems.  ::He smiled again::  anything I can do for you?<br>
<br>
::Nico shook her head, disappointed.  The cart was across the mountains...a two and a half day journey from the supplies:: No...thank you.<br>
