She stood there,looking at the fallen tree then,her fists clentched in tight fists,her chest heaving as her breathing hardened,not from the energy she used,but from the heat of the sun that had been taking its toll on her.<br>
The sun not only making her agressive,but disturbing her eyes,which were sensitive to light,but luckily she had a second lid that closed around her eyes,making her eyes darker than usual,but shaded them well enough.<br>
<br>
Relaxing for the moment,she unballed her fists,that right spike soon disappearing back into her flesh as she relaxed her muscles.Turning now,she made her way once again toward the village.Once reaching the top of a hill which over looked the village,she stopped for the moment,bringing her left hand up,and wripping the beads of sweat from her forehead.Then letting her hand drop back down to her side.She stood there for a long moment,just staring at the village,she was an amazon here,but she still couldnt help but feel unwelcomed.It didnt really matter,she had gotten this far,and need to get out of the heat.<br>
Ah,but the heat had already taken it's toll,she was exhausted.She tethered a little,then colapsed,falling to her back.A slight groan escaping her throat as she lay there.She felt weak and unable to mobilize,all she could do was bring her right hand up to cover her face from the rays of the sun....<br>
Maybe she'd just lay here until the sun-sets..... <p>---Everybody Got a sanity------I've got a split personality---</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uiizeliaii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>II Zelia II</A> at: 8/3/01 4:20:09 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uiizeliaii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>II Zelia II</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#993300>(8/4/01 3:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=262.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ....Damn the heat!....</span><hr size=1> She didn't know how long she had been lying there,in the open,the sun blaring down on her.She must have passed out.Her chest was still heaving,as she pulled her hand away from her face.She gained some energy back,and with that little bit of energy,she braced her elbows onto the ground,and pushed herself up into a sitting position.She then settled the palms of her hands on the ground,and pushed her self up,and onto her feet,however now crouching.<br>
<br>
She then brought her right hand up and shaded her eyes as she looked down upon the village.&quot;Get going.&quot; She told herself.She then stood up,and straightened herself out.It was too damn hot,and again her hands were clentched into tight fists,the veins in her arms pulsing with every nerve in her body trying to fight the itch to go down and destroy something.,even if it would drain her energy...all she felt was like killing and destroying.&quot;Maybe coming to Themiscrya was a bad idea....?&quot;Again,she talked to herself.<br>
&quot;Ha,I kept telling you to stay in the cave....moron.&quot;Those words were spat from her mouth,unable to control her 'dark side' from popping up from time to time.It came to often that she was heared humiliating herself or making stupid comments,something that always got her on the edge,she couldnt keep that voice out of her head,and it drove her crazy.Crazy enough that she let out a scream of frustration and anger.&quot;Go Away!&quot;<br>
&quot;You're stuck with me!Besides....i'm your only friend.Now move it before you get us killed.&quot;That stupid voice.She brought her hands up and held her head in her hands,eyes closed tightly,teeth clentched.Her breathing becoming more heavy.&quot;Go away.&quot;She spoke once again,quietly through clentched teeth.<br>
<br>
A few moments later,and all quite.The veins in her arms,and any other visable part of her body were visably pulsing,her demon form threatening to show itself.And it began.The flesh on her forarms slowly began to tear,though she tried to fight it,but with little energy she was failing.The tips of spikes began to slowly peek from the torn flesh.Even the back of her shirt began to rip open as these spikes slowly tore through the flesh and the clothing she wore.A growl now escaped her throat,though she had been in demon form once or twice before,she was yet to be use to the pain of her flesh tearing each time this happened.<br>
<br>
She fell to her knees,her hands digging into the soil beneath her hands.She was fighting it alright.The spikes stopped growing only reaching half thier size of 10-15 inches.<br>
Though the spikes had now ceased,they were still visable.Her entire back almost completly covered with 5-8 inch spikes.A 12 inch spike coming from each of her wrists,and running the length of her arms,while smaller spikes petruded on different areas of the arms.All other areas of her body,fortunate enough not to be covered in spikes at that moment.She was going to control this,or die of exhaustion while trying.....<br>
<br>
And she stayed there,on her knees,still her hands dug into the dirt.Eye still tightly closed.Using every mental ability she had to fight this urge.... <p>---Everybody Got a sanity------I've got a split personality---</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uposeidonkofc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poseidonkofc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 132<br> <font color=#993300>(8/7/01 3:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=262.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Consort</span><hr size=1> ::A deep, curling mist passes over the hill and then settles over Zelia enveloping her as she kneels on the floor.

Poseidon is wearing a small, thin, see-through loin cloth made of white velvet. And on his feet he has a pair of golden sandles. The god folds his arms across his muscular chest and looks down upon the woman. His curls fall across his face and his blue eyes glow with intrigue.::<br>

Slowly she stood,her head twitching slighty her hands clentching the soil she had torn from the ground,all instinct she had was telling her to attack the god,but instead a smirk crosses those crimson lips,as she controled that part of herself.<br>

And so it one claiming they know more then one person who they know not one thing about. Please, I am not trying to be harsh or anything like that. Just asking you to please take yourself off you high horse, its rather silly, and making you look even sillier. I graduated college with a degree in Classical Mythology. My final term paper was Greek Myth zeroing in on the Gods of Olympus, plus the lesser gods, which I recieved an A on. So please, before you start running your trap about how you know more then someone you've never met, never spoken to, never seen and never will. MAKE SURE, you are the right party...Thank you, Eris mun Anita. I'm sure you are going to want to reply to my blunt honesty, I'm sure your male ego cannot handle what I have said, and in reaction to that, please email me at ChaoticDiscordxx@aol.com.And I shall reply to your comments when the time suits me.<br>
 My apologies Zelia mun for this in the middle of your story line and I am sorry I made the board all crazed like. If you wish to have Eris in this story line any further, please make a new topic, for I am not going to be checking this one any further...Anita }} <p>Goddess Eris

<br>
She then felt his pressence fading,what a relief.<br>
<br>
But then,Hypnos had to go and do the eye thing,and her eyes diolated.She brought the back of her right hand up and blocked out the lights,what was he trying to do,blind her?She closed her eyes tightly,and fell to one knee,her left hand braced against the ground,a low growl escaping those crimson lips.She was getting a major headache,and surprisingly her alter ego had yet to take over,another relief.<br>
<br>
Well,this certainly has been quite a trip,next time,she'll take her own advise and stay in her happy little cave.<br>
<br>
Oh wait,lets try to make things interesting,shall we....<br>
<br>
And without further ado,she let out another growl,this one louder,and more threatening,and her hands balled up into tight fists,she stood up,and as she did so a spike of 12 inches in length,beginning from the wrists of each arm tears through her skin and running the length of her arms.And suddenly with great speed,she runs toward the large oak where Hypnos was,her left arm coming up across her chest,then jolted out and across the stem of the tree,slicing it clean in half and causing the large tree to thump to the ground.She then jerked her body back the other direction,and bringing both her arms up,fists inward,spikes out and crossed,she sets the very tip of the razor sharp spike directly at the throat of Hypnos,with a simple movement she could bring her arms down and embed the spike into the throat of the god.Not that it could do much damage,but her alter ego took surface and she was pissed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whats with the light show?&quot;She spoke angrily.<br>
<br>
Sure,Hypnos seemed to have been trying to do a nice thing,but to this side of her,it didnt matter.<br>

<br>
&quot;That hurt!&quot;She growled as she raised her head to look at Hypnos,who had by now fallen to the ground himself.And she rose up to her feet slowly as she blocked out the pain she was feeling.And again her hands were clentched into tight fists,her chest heaving as her breathing hardened,Oh yeah,she was mad.<br>
<br>
She wasn't one for giving up,even if she knew she could be defeated by a god,but not without a fight.And she decided close fighting with a god was out for now,so she looked down at the split rock she had smashed into.She leant over,and just as she did,the nuckles of her right fist were now armed with short 5 inch spikes on each of her 4 nuckles,and with a quick punching movement she took out a fist sized chunk of the stone,and then with the same movement did the same to the opposite side of the stone,making something we could call 'handles'.Once that was done,the spikes from her nuckles retracted,and she then grabbed hold of the stone by the two 'handles' she created in it.And with a strength passed down to her by her father (The Soverign)She lifted the large stone up,then with some effort she brought it over her head,then pushing her arms forward,she thrusted the heavy stone into the air,and across the field,in an attempt to have it land and crush the fallen Hypnos. <p>---Everybody Got a sanity------I've got a split personality---</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=hypnos>Hypnos </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 169<br> <font color=#993300>(8/14/01 11:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=262.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=C:\WINDOWS\Desktop\Stuff\hypnos.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Oooooooo</span><hr size=1> &quot; Just because I'm down doesn't meen I'm not defenseless...&quot; ***The large rock flys through the air and smashes into the ground right onto of Hypnos appearing that it smashed him...Then right behind Zelia a group of cobalts appear, with Hypnos standing behind them giving a weak grin...
