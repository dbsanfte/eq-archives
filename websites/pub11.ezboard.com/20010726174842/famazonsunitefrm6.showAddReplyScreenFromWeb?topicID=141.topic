The young girl was obviously Dawn's with her emarld eyes and blonde hair. Since she had begun to grow she changed from looking much like her father. And she didn't know that this trail she chose to travel upon, was between Amazon Lands and Centuar lands. Bad Combo.<br>
<br>
 Natailya gently kneeled to play with a lady bug or catipillar some sort of bug. And as she did a horse/human trotted up behind her.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Hey there. Your mommy is Dawn isn't she?&quot;<br>
<br>
 The young Amazon without looking nodded, giving that mmmhmm sound.<br>
 &quot;Your mommy killed my father Pobre. Back in the centuar war.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Natailya frowned, and turned. Just as she did down came a centuar's blade and many kicks. When the beast trotted off, the young girl was unconcious, bleeding badly. Pretty much dead. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualysiaofscynthia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alysia of Scynthia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#993300>(5/29/01 7:22:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=141.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To Mommy's village.</span><hr size=1> Alysia had been training back in Scynthia with Belle for a while now. However, this was a certain night that Belle needed to be by herself. She needed time to learn things that only she could teach herself.<br>
<br>
Alysia decided that this was a time to go to some neihboring villages and make some trades. <br>
<br>
Aly had taken some herbs, food and a single vile of Wolf's Blood. (Note: Wolf's Blood in this SL is like the first Version of Morphine. Very popular LOL) She knew it would come in handy during trades.<br>
<br>
She glanced as she saw the Centaur/Amazon boundary line. Most amazons knew not to cross it. Though a treaty had been made between Xenan and a few tribes, some rogue Centaurs were still a little upset at the outcome of the last war.<br>
<br>
She lead her horse's reigns against the boundary line as she looked into the Centaur lands sighing wishing that things didn't have to end the way they had. <br>
<br>
Something then caught her eye . . . .a child.<br>
<br>
She rushed over to the child, reconizing Nataliya immediatly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nataliya?!&quot; <br>
<br>
In a rush to save the child's life she gently wiped some of the blood from her face. She frowned as she saw some of the bruises and deep cuts. A large bruise against the child's right leg. A hoofprint.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gods. . . Dawn's going to freak.&quot;<br>
<br>
Another one of the Scynthian Amazons rushed to Aly's side when Alysia made the call of emergency.<br>
<br>
&quot;Get to Orio-Pata as fast as you can. And send a few of my wolves out to Themiscrya and near the foot of Olympus. As well to the neihboring villages. Scout them for Queen Dawn. And hurry&quot;<br>
<br>
The Amazon did as was told as Alysia opened the vile of Wolf's Blood placing small drops into the cuts of the child. She then placed her hands on Nataliya's forehead using the God-like powers she still had. They would not be much, for Alysia had been using them alot lately for the wounded still back at Helicon.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come on Nataliya.&quot;<br>
<br>
She mumbled as a gold light shimmered around the child.<br>
<br>
Nothing happened. . . . <br>
<br>
She would have to call the ancients soon. . . .<br>

Now that most was done the Amazons from North had found her with sadden faces and worried her. <br>
<br>
 One Scout Spoke &quot;Queen Dawnithinia was your daughter headed to the Northern Lands?&quot;<br>

 Dawn nodded and replied &quot;Yes, she wanted to see more of the lands I was involved in, more of the nation, etc&quot;<br>

 The second scout frowned, but did not look at the Queen.<br>
<br>
 Dawn had found this puzzling and grown worried. &quot;Did something happen to Natailya?&quot;<br>
<br>
 They nodded, and followed Dawn as she rushed to a guard told her that she was headed North, and then went to the stables. In that time they had told her that Alysia found the young child, on the trail between Amazons and Centuars. They did not know what happened but it obviously was an attack from a centuar. Who knew..<br>

 Dawn had immediately saddled her horse, and took off.

Cyane placed her hand on Nataliya's forehead once more.<br>
&quot;Her soul has already passed on. We must move quickly so that the body has a chance.&quot;<br>

<br>

&quot;Our sister knows of the ritual but nothing of what is to come to both she and the child's mother.&quot;<br>

&quot;She bore the blood of the Atmah, should we really consider doing this to her?&quot;<br>

Cyane sighed.<br>
&quot;The mother's shall consider this a blessing. For Alysia shall recieve something she has had taken from her, and Dawn shall keep her daughter in a way as well as gain another child.&quot;<br>

&quot;Is this the only way Cyane.&quot;<br>

 Emerald orbs caught glimpse of Alysia, and Natailya whose body was floating in mid-air. In return to seeing this Dawn nickered to the horse who slowed down to a trot as they approached.

&quot;I'm not too sure Dawn. Nataliya was attacked by a Centaur, a rogue one I'm guessing. The ancients are confusing me a little. I tried to save her but my powers are not strong enough at the moment. The acients. . .they say that they can save her.&quot;<br>
<br>
She shook her head as she watched in awe.<br>
<br>
&quot;But they said some confusing things, it would no longer be Nataliya . . . but another should take her place and live and grow as another.&quot;<br>
<br>
The ancients then turned to Alysia and held their hands out to her. Instantly, Alysia knew what was going as Samsara spoke through her.<br>
<br>
Samsara turned to Dawn and spoke softly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dawn, your daughter is gone, she shall rest in peace in our world. Alysia saved her much pain. The Shaman ways that are taught in Scynthia have been proven useful. Nataliya did not suffer as greatly as the centaur had hoped.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then placed a hand on Dawn's shoulder, the power of the living ancient let Dawn know a little of what was happening. Another should take the place so that Dawn should not lose her child, but gain one instead.<br>
<br>
She then spoke again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nataliya is gone Dawnithinia, but another takes her place as we speak. Another. . .that shall hold the blood of both Queen's. He has once saved our tribe Dawn. He shall again come and bring forth a United Nation between Orio-Pata and Scynthia. With no father, and two biological mothers, he shall rise again and gain the glory he once held.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then almost stepped out of Alysia's body and touched Nataliya.<br>
<br>
&quot;By the Light of Alysia, the Strength of Dawn, and the Power of the Amazon Nation. Wulf shall live again!&quot;<br>
<br>
In a mere instant, the Ancients were gone and Alysia and Dawn were both knocked to the ground, much like they had been in the Alt. Roman War. Neither in pain or bleeding.

<br>
&quot;What are you looking at?&quot;<br>
<br>
She quirked a brow and pushed her attention to the unconscious child.<br>
<br>
O.O<br>
<br>
Her heart almost dropped as she held her breath.<br>
<br>
&quot;It. . .It can't be?&quot;<br>
<br>
She began to shake a bit as a single tear fell down her face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wulf?&quot;<br>

 She shook her head, and then rubbed her eyes. Looking back at the child. She couldn't remember much, only that whatever that Centuar did was really something, Natailya looked like Wulf!<br>
<br>
 Emerald orbs opened once more and looked at the child. Dawn had now accepted that it was Wulf, once again.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Stupid Centuar. He brought back Wulf. Oh boy.

<br>
 &quot;Perhaps he wanted to come, not a choice. He knew had to leave, and the ancients knew how much he loved this land. Maybe they gave him the chance to return, to the place he loves so much. Perhaps he wanted to come back..&quot;<br>

 &quot;Well if the Ancients were able to bring Wulf back, then they never let his soul die. So then he never lost his memory or memories.

He softly spoke to himself.<br>
