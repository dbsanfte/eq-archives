<br>
DeL sits in the middle of the village cursing , trying to get a splinter out of her foot.<br>
<br>
Tasha moonlight steps out of terra's hut look around.<br>
<br>
Ariana sighed as she walked through the villiage.  Her gaze was intent on a small book in her hands.<br>
<br>
As Hippolyte looked about, she thought today would be a good day to celebrate the fact that the village still stood proudly. A symbol of all they had worked for, she had spoken with the cooks earlier and asked for them to make something special for the village.<br>
<br>
DeLerium mumbled about centaurs smelly bums as she pokes at her foot with a pin, the spinter pops up and she grabs it , yanking it out, she smiles victorious.<br>
<br>
Tasha: *watched del from a few feet away* the great warrior<br>
<br>
Suddenly starting up from a day dream like trance, Ariana lifted her bright hazel eyes.  Scanning for anyone else around, she quietly hummed a sad song.<br>
<br>
Hipp:  Alcinoe, please.. send word out to our athelfi to join us in the great hall.. I believe that the feast is ready.  *Hipp smiled and turned..walking to the great feast hall*<br>
<br>
Tasha walked to Del:: show it no mercy<br>
<br>
DeLerium got up and put her boot on and snapped the splinter in two~<br>
<br>
DeL: Id rather be stabbed by a dagger then these damn things. *she smiled to Tasha*<br>
<br>
Tasha: *smiles* thats my aunt<br>
<br>
Ariana swiftly came across two fellow sisters, noting the one looked a bit agitated, she stopped.<br>
<br>
Ariana: Is everything alright? *she asked shyly*<br>
<br>
DeLerium: *she nodded* Just a splinter...I think Ill live..I had worse..<br>
<br>
Alcinoe: *walking along the village she began to speak loudly to all*  The Vasilissa has had a great feast prepared for all our athefli!  Those interested go to the Great Hall!<br>
<br>
Tasha: she is being so brave<br>
<br>
DeLerium jumps as Alcione yells.<br>
<br>
Ariana: *Smiles* Bravery is a great thing- if you need an ointment, though, I do have some.  *Hears a shout* hmm...<br>
<br>
Hippolyte had entered the Great Hall and smiled as she saw the feast spread out before her.  She walked over and glanced over the food with a big smile.<br>
<br>
Hipp:  It looks great!<br>
<br>
Tasha: aunty Del do you need to be carried to dinner??<br>
<br>
DeL: *looks to Tasha with a raised brow* A little splinter cannot stop the Great princess of Themiscrya. *she looked to Relena* Nah, Ill be okay, Ill just rub some salt into it...that will do.<br>
<br>
Theseus runs into the great hall a lizard clutched in one hand and a stick in the other, his eyes wide.<br>
<br>
THESEUS:  By Dah Gods!  *eyes the food*  I is soooo hungwy and so is Brutus.<br>
<br>
Ariana: *She smiled her ever bright smile*  As you wish.  <br>
<br>
Hippolyte turned around and chuckled seeing Theseus's eyes getting large at all the food.<br>
<br>
Hipp: The great little hunter have a big appetite tonight?<br>
<br>
DeL: For the love of Zeus  ~she swat a a yellowjacket as it buzzed around her head, she ran and dodged it~<br>
<br>
All Theseus manages to do is just nod, his mouth drops open slightly.<br>
<br>
Hipp:  Now you will need to save some food for the amazons!<br>
<br>
Tasha moonlight walks to the great hall.<br>
<br>
DeLerium followed behind Tasha, still swatting at the darned bee.<br>
<br>
Ariana: *Following suit, she strode into the grand hall.* Wow *She mumbled in awe*<br>
<br>
Tasha: *looks over her shoulder* if i get stung you are going to get it<br>
<br>
Amazon cooks began to walk around placing even more food out for all to enjoy.<br>
<br>
DeL: is that a threat young lady?<br>
<br>
Tasha: yes<br>
<br>
DeLerium steps inside, the bee following.<br>
<br>
Ariana giggling, she stretched out her hand.  A blue mist rose from her palm enveloping the now sleeping bee.<br>
<br>
Hippolyte turned around and smiled seeing some of her athelfi enter.<br>
<br>
Hipp: Welcome athelfi..this feast is in honour of all of Themiscrya...and my gift to all of you.<br>
<br>
As the bee fell alseep, it landed on the table besides a bowl of soup, Del slammed her hand on it, killing it.<br>
<br>
Alastor Alcon shook his head slowly as he entered the great halls staying to himself as always, he had been almost a ghost in the village since his arrival and this was nothing different he would only observe and speak when spoken to.<br>
<br>
Once again, DeL smiled victorious.<br>
<br>
Tasha:  *walks to hipp going to one knee* Yasoo your highness<br>
<br>
Ariana bowed her formal bow to her Queen, her smile never left her lips.<br>
<br>
Theseus grins broadly, clearly proud of his mommy. Then moves to scoop up the dead bee for his lizard to eat.<br>
<br>
Theseus: *grins at Del* Thank you for Bwutus, he is hungwy!!!<br>
<br>
DeLerium looked at her hand and wrinkled her nose, then turned to Alastor as he arrived, wih a grin she wiped her hand on him.<br>
<br>
DeL: *she turned to Thesus with a smile* Your welcome my dear<br>
<br>
Theseus blushes at the term of endearment, cocks his head a moment to study Del.<br>
<br>
Theseus:  You not mawwied are you?<br>
<br>
DeL: *raises a brow at the boy* DeL: noooo<br>
<br>
Hipp: *smiled* well..everyone..get some food and enjoy...I am blessed to have you as athelfi..and so I return the thanks.<br>
<br>
Faith appears in the back in the shadows.<br>
<br>
Tasha: *stands looking at theseus* hey kid<br>
<br>
Theseus: *ducks his head and scurries back to his mommy* I was just asteding you.<br>
<br>
Alastor Alcon bites his tongue slowly as he holds back a comment not showing a sign of caring at all as he moved to the wall leaning against it quietly watching little thesus with amusement.<br>
<br>
DeL walked to a seat and plopped down.<br>
<br>
Theseus cuts his blue green eyes towards Tasha and almost pouts.<br>
<br>
Faith walx to the table slowly.<br>
<br>
Hippolyte smiles at Alastor and Faith and waves them over to the food as she walks over and picks up a hunk of cheese.  <br>
<br>
Hipp:  Everyone is invited in the village..come and sit.<br>
<br>
Tasha: ahhh i am sorry ::smiles:: hey great warrior<br>
<br>
Ariana: *She poured a glass of wine* We are only too honored to have you as our queen.  ::She raised a glass as a toast to all athelfi::<br>
<br>
Faith smiles at hipp and sits herself at the table to eat.<br>
<br>
Theseus puffs his chest out and sits the lizard on the table only to watch it scurry to a dish of fresh fruit and start to nibble.<br>
<br>
DeL raised her glass of water.<br>
<br>
Tasha looks around picking up a glass.<br>
<br>
Faith picks up her cider saluting her queen.<br>
<br>
Hipp smiled at their words and found herself a seat near them.  Finding a goblet and a bottle of red wine, she filled her own vessel and raised it to them all.<br>
<br>
Hipp:  To the Amazons and our allies..may we forever be united and proud.<br>
<br>
DeL: Damn straight<br>
<br>
Theseus: *nods* DAMNED STWAIGHT!!<br>
<br>
Hippolyte blinked at Theseus.<br>
<br>
Ariana: Hear Hear! ::She cheered:: <br>
<br>
DeL chuckled.<br>
<br>
Tasha giggled.<br>
<br>
Faith: *nods and whispers* Theres no truer statement<br>
<br>
Theseus: *points at Del* Hewrs telled me it!<br>
<br>
Hipp:  *raising a brow*  Who has been teaching him that ?<br>
<br>
Tasha points at Del.<br>
<br>
With a grin, DeL stands up and tiptoes out the hut.<br>
<br>
Alastor Alcon smiles slowly at the smaller one and his language shaking his head slowly as he continues to stay in his place. <br>
<br>
Hipp: DeL taught him that? *she raises a brow as her rite of caste quickly exits after that*<br>
<br>
Mh Faith watches DeL go.<br>
<br>
Theseus scooped up the now full lizard and dropped him into his pocket.<br>
<br>
Theseus: Dat's a gooood wittle Bwutus.  Taked a nap now.<br>
<br>
Faith takes a sip of her cider and puts a piece of buttered bread into her mouth.<br>
<br>
Hippolyte took a bite of some of her cheese and looked out among her athelfi.  After eating a bit of the food she turned to them.<br>
<br>
Hipp:  Well, now that we are all here and relaxed..is there any news that i have missed, lately?<br>
<br>
Tasha sits back with her cup watching.<br>
<br>
Theseus walks ot Tasha and leans on her legs, kinda coyly.<br>
<br>
Theseus: Did you know my mommy told me dat boys have do daws and giwls have nu nus? *raises an eyebrow at her*<br>
<br>
Ariana shruged, her quests were of little consequences to the nation.<br>
<br>
Tasha: *touches his head and whispers* yasoo bother<br>
<br>
Hipp raised a brow and tried to ignore Theseus's little chat with Tasha.  <br>
<br>
Tasha giggled.<br>
<br>
Hipp: I have grown concerned that Dawnithinia and Sartha have not returned from their trip to Gargerensia.  Has anyone heard from them? *she raised a brow wondering*<br>
<br>
Tasha: i will not tell you what she told me about boys and girls<br>
<br>
Theseus: *nods excitedly* anna she tolded me too dat I wouldn't not get a soft spot lika dose. *points to Tasha's chest*<br>
<br>
Faith shakes her head.<br>
<br>
Ariana: *Her face fell, she had not had word of her two friends in quite a long time* Not I.. *She said regretfully*<br>
<br>
Tasha: no little bother you will not. but you will have things that i will not have so we are even<br>
<br>
Hipp: I am wondering if I should send out a search party.  It has been awhile since they left to go see what the village of men are up to.<br>
<br>
Faith: give them a few more days if they dont return then send out a search party <br>
<br>
Theseus:  Budda I wike dem! Especkially when I am sweeping. *grins* Didda you meeted Bwutus, my wizahd?<br>
<br>
Ariana: *She stirred in her seat* I don't think that would be such a bad idea, but say we did go out to look for them and then found them allright.  They might be a tad angry that we didn't have more confidence in them.<br>
<br>
Tasha: yes they do make very nice pillows<br>
<br>
Hippolyte nodded as she was told to give them time.<br>
<br>
Faith: *nods*  i agree<br>
<br>
Tasha: you will just have to find a nice girl with them<br>
<br>
Theseus: Budda my mommies haved da best ones in da whole wided wowld!<br>
<br>
Hipp: You are both speaking very true.  I would not want to offend them.  They are great warriors.. and I should give them more time.  I just have never trusted the Gargerensians..and well..they have just not to trust the Themiscryans.<br>
<br>
Tasha looks at her mother.<br>
<br>
Faith shakes her head at theseus and nods at what her queen said.<br>
<br>
Ariana: Nor do i trust them either, but we must have faith that they will return to us.  I'm not one to pray, but i might consider it myself for thier safe return.<br>
<br>
Alastor crouched down slowly against the wall as he pulls a small circle frome his pocket and a loop through the string attached later generations would call this a yoyo. He looked at thesus slowly making it go up an down seeing if it will attract his attention.<br>
<br>
Tasha: i will take word on that brother<br>
<br>
Theseus cocks his head at the ball the man is playing with.  He is curious but he does not trust men to a large degree and is therefore wary of them.<br>
<br>
Hipp:  I doubt they would be offended by prayer. *she smiled softly*  It never hurts to pray for our athelfi, friends, and other loved ones.<br>
<br>
Tasha: *looks where her bother looks* that looks fun<br>
<br>
Faith: :nods:thats true<br>
<br>
Ariana: *She allowed herslef a soft smile*  True.<br>
<br>
Alastor pulls it up into his palm hold it out in his hand to the small boy. Smiling slowly to the small adventurer.<br>
<br>
Theseus: *frowns lightly and moves closer to tasha, blinking at the man and the toy* Canna I pway wif it?<br>
<br>
Hipp: For that matter it would not hurt to pray for all of our athelfi who were not able to attend this feast.  As they either work to protect and lead the different Amazon villages or travel the outside worlds.  I shall pray for them all myself.<br>
<br>
Tasha: *smiles at her bother and stands holding out her had* lets go see it<br>
<br>
Ariana bowed her head, in her heart she prayed.<br>
<br>
Alastor tosses it lightly into the hand of the young girl. Then standing up agin leans against the wall staying quiet as not to bother anyone ::<br>
<br>
Hipp smiled as she saw her athelfi bend her head down.  She knew in these hard times..she was very thankful to see her athelfi.  As she worried for those she had not seen in weeks.<br>
<br>
Faith bows her head and prays for her fellow athelfi:<br>
<br>
Tasha: *catches it* thank you Sir<br>
<br>
Theseus smiles at the man and then turns his attention to the toy.<br>
<br>
Tasha holds it out to him.<br>
<br>
With the outside world moving closer to the amazon lands..and the threats it brought.  The mother in Hippolyte..made her worry more for her athelfi.  How much longer those who seek to control all would stay away..she did not know.<br>
<br>
Theseus: Canna you do whatta he did? *holding Tasha's hand tightly but bouncing to try to get a better look and then finally take it from her.  He tried to yo-yo but only succeeded in sending the contraption rolling across the floor.<br>
<br>
Tasha grabs it as it rolled by.<br>
<br>
Ariana: *sipped from her glass*  Times may seem grim and dark, but there is always a light at the end of the tunnel.. I think we will remain strong.<br>
<br>
Tasha: *hands it back* lets ask him to slow us how it works<br>
<br>
Hippolyte smiled at Theseus.  And nodded. <br>
<br>
Faith: drinx the rest of her cider:<br>
<br>
Hipp: You are correct....and we are strong and true.  We will not allow those who seek to end our way of life and freedom to stop it.:she raises her cup to them in the air again::  So let's party ::she laughs::<br>
<br>
Theseus hearing his mom speak stood up straight.<br>
<br>
Theseus: Damn stwaight wet's pawty!!<br>
<br>
Ariana:  As long as I live I won't let them bring harm to that which I hold most dear- my sisters!  <br>
<br>
Faith: :shakes her head slightly:<br>
<br>
Theseus wiggles his booty and dances like all five year olds can dance.<br>
<br>
Tasha looks at Alastor and then puts her hand over her bothers mouth.<br>
<br>
Hippolyte laughed at the dancing boy.<br>
<br>
Faith: im sorry my queen but i must be getting back to my daughter and partner.<br>
<br>
Tasha moonlight: :: Giggles::shhhhhhhh<br>
<br>
Theseus blinks at the hand over his mouth, grinning he sticks out his tongue and licks Tasha's hand.  Then giggles as she pulls it away.<br>
<br>
Ariana: *Rising, she sighed*  I am sorry to cut short these festivities, but my time grows short.  Fare thee well.  ::She bowed once again to her queen::<br>
<br>
Hipp:  Be safe, my athelfi.  It is good to see you well and strong. and to know you are safe and happy.<br>
<br>
Theseus: *hearing the word partner* Giddy up pahdner!<br>
<br>
Tasha: eewww :<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ulls her hand away:: that is gross<br>
<br>
Faith smiled and waved to everyone.<br>
<br>
Hippolyte raised her hands in the air and clinked her bracers together in salute.<br>
<br>
Ariana smiled, then dissappeared into the night.<br>
<br>
Faith pushed her chair out and walx to the shadows disappearing. *but not before she bows her blonde head to the queen*<br>
<br>
Theseus: *laughs at Tasha's reaction* I lickeded you!! *sticks his tongue out to do it again*<br>
<br>
Hipp glances over to Alastor, Tasha and Theseus and their little party and chuckles. <br>
The small group continued to enjoy each other's company, learning of the strange toy brought to the party by Alastor.  They ate, chatted and drank... until all tired and retired to their huts.   Safe and thankful for their friends and family.<br>
