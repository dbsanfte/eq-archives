Sartha chuckled lightly. It was quite a wonderful thing to receive a dagger from Dawn. That's why Sar knew it was a special dagger. And then Dawn stepped back and it then became Sartha's turn. She stepped forward quietly, something appearing in her hand. She looked down at the babe with a smile- something close to a soft, real smile, and moved her hand to reveal her present::<br>
<br>
::As Sartha's hand opened, a light of deepest blue filled the room for but a moment. As the light cleared, something bright and small flew up into the air and another object was left upon her palm::<br>
<br>
::In that open palm sat a small locket of glimmering gold. It was shaped as a heart with a small rose positioned in the center and gold-green vines wrapping around the locket as if they were sealing it shut. The locket seemed to have a white glow to itself::<br>
<br>
::Her silvery golden eyes moved to Hera and she gave her a light bow::<br>
<br>
&quot;The first part of my present, this locket, was made from a material similar to gold from the place where I was raised as an Amazon. Within it is the power of many strong Amazons that had passed on from that place. The locket is a symbol of the bonds and strength Amazons share. I hope she will grow to share those same kinds of bonds with those close to her... If you look inside, there are magical images that play by of generations past. Memories, almost...&quot;<br>
<br>
::Those silvery-golden eyes looked up at the small form that had shot from her hand. The light surrounding the form was blinding at it was the blue light they had all seen. She looked back to Hera::<br>
<br>
&quot;The small entity above you is a guardian of my own creation. She will live as long as you or she deem necessary to watch over your child. She is a faithful friend, and she is trustworthy... Congratulations... you're daughter is a blessing to us all.&quot;<br>
