Too many years living among mortals had made her softer than she would have ever liked, but her own protection was the sacrifice she made to watch over her sisters with a true heart.

 Dawn gave a slight smile. She was happy to be back in her spot as cheiftess, but things in gargarensia were things she wasn't happy about telling upon her return. <br>

 Emerald pools turned from where Sartha left to finally look at Hippolyte.<br>
<br>
 &quot;The intial report is that Gargarensia is just the opposite of us. They treat women as objects, slaves, and house wives. They are just toys to them, things to do their bidding. They rule the roost, so to speak.&quot;<br>

"Yes, Vasilissa," spoke the guardian softly.  The guardian swiftly moved towards the hut to deliver the message.<br>
The smaller amazon strode into the barn and quickly outfitted one of her horses and then rode off towards the river in a steady cantor...giving herself still the time to think. <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

Dawn stood, and slipped silently out of the Queen's hut, giving a short nod to the guards on duty.<br>
<br>
 The amazon then slipped off to the side, immediately out of the village. She'd gotten used to the quiet of the forest and found it easier to track her way to the riverfront, than before, and easier without a horse.<br>
<br>
 Infact.. Dawn beat Hippolyte to the riverside. Her feet planting softly into the rocky side. She'd wait. <p>

A slight smirk came to her lips, at seeing the assassin waiting.  She lifted her arms up and quietly saluted her athelfi and then slid off the side of her mare as they made it to the bank.  <br>
<br>
She looked to Dawn, her head slightly tilted to the side. "So...what do you think we should do?"  She wanted to hear an honest answer from those she would speak to.  Answers without any need to please the queen of Themiscrya.  Just honest...feelings and wisdom. <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

Her hands gently folded behind her back, and her voice to follow gave only the chosen words and feelings of the assassin.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Take this as something strikingly odd, Hippolyte. I'm an assassin and one to love blood shed, and what I'm about to say..is going to strike you hard.&quot;<br>
<br>
 A hand behind her back moved abit before Dawn ended her silence, and started again.<br>
<br>
 &quot;This war is useless, and won't get us anything. It would be more of a regression for this tribe, and this nation than it would be anything else. If we fight those airhead men, it will be a loss to the ladies living there. They could leave if they wish, and they have not.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn paused once more, choosing her words again very wisely.<br>
<br>
 &quot;There are things in that village that would make amazons make sacrafices, choices they need not make. There are things there that are there for a retreat and could do US harm. I'm telling you no war. Its not needed, and not wanted.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Finally Dawn's eyes raised to meet Hippolytes, her face stern. This was the noble and wise Queen side of the Queen of Orio-Pata.<br>
<br>
 &quot;No.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessageRange?topicID=239.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessageRange?topicID=239.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessageRange?topicID=239.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessageRange?topicID=239.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a> <b>5</b> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessageRange?topicID=239.topic&start=101&stop=101>6</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessage?topicID=295.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessage?topicID=296.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.emailToFriend?topicID=239.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.threadControl?topicID=239.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=239.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=239.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm37">The Mythical Odyssey Forum<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitefrm32">The Mythical Odyssey<option value="amazonsunitefrm35">Amazon Nation Alliance<option value="amazonsunitefrm33">Character Descriptions<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm30">Amazons of the Sacred Circle<option value="amazonsunitefrm34">Amazons of Lesvos Island<option value="amazonsunitefrm38">High Mountain Tiger Clan<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm28">Amazon Sisters of Cremni<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm31">Amazon Language<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya>Sisters of Themiscrya</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
