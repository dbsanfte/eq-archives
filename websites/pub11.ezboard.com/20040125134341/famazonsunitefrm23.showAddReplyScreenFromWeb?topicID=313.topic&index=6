<br>
&quot;My dear Hecate, you just don't get it to do you?&quot;<br>
<br>
::He stood a little bit more at ease and approached her slowly, that same grin upon his face, not intimidated at all by her stance::<br>
<br>
&quot;Everything dies.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He turned around as if to walk away, but then stopped and turned around, walking towards her again::<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, I forget, dear Hecate, you need elaboration upon such cryptic statements.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He placed his hands behind his back and slowly began pacing about::<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you know how it is I had such easy access to this temple? You had to tear down the magickal barriers and storm your way in. I strolled my way in through the shadows, no fighting, no energy expended other than to walk. This temple is not incredibly well maintained. There are shrubs and weeds growing about this place. Plants die. Therefore I have access to see and visit them. If it is alive, it will inevitably come under my domain. I know WHEN it will die.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He paused for a moment and then cleared his throat::<br>
<br>
&quot;I remember a time of oblivion. Upon my birth, I was swallowed by father, Cronus. Me and four of my siblings. You see, Cronus knew that one of us would succeed him. He was afraid, he feared that day desperately. Desperatly enough that he swallowed his own children. Spending time in his belly was as if existing within oblivion. Ask any of the original Olympians, save Zeus of course about it, and they will tell you the same. It is for that act of freedom that I will be eternally grateful to Zeus, despite our other differences.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He looked about the temple and walked about with his hands behind him::<br>
<br>
&quot;Cronus of course was successor to Grandfather Uranus. Now let me ask you? Where is Grandfather Uranus now? No one has seen or heard from him since he was immasculated. Where is Father Cronus. Locked away in the bowels fo Tartarus, existing in oblivion. The same fate that he had bestowed upon me and my siblings. You see, we were born, Hecate. We were ALL created. And thus we will ALL die. Myself included.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He once again, turned his direct attention to Hecate. He gave her a very piercing gaze. The type of gaze that would literally strike terror into the heart of a mere mortal. He knew Hecate would not run in fear, this was not his intention::<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, eventually the mortals will forget me. And yes, some other being yet to be created, or one that exists in another time, another place, shall be the Lord of the Dead. Mortals will also forget magick. They will forget that it exists. And thus, you will also fade into an unconscious oblivion. ALL the Olympians will fade away.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He paused for a moment and relaxed his gaze a bit::<br>
<br>
&quot;You may not wish to accept your fate, and this is fine. You can leave this world the same way you came in, Kicking and Screaming. But inevitably, you WILL leave this world. It is the way of things. The old must die to make room for the young. And yes, eventually we will make room for others.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He sighed for a moment:: &quot;When I first became Lord of the Underworld, I foresaw the very same prediction that haunts you. I approached the Fates with practically the same questions. They responded with a very simple, cryptic, and yet profound statement, from a writer that has yet to be born.&quot;<br>
<br>
'That is not dead which can eternal lie, <br>
And with strange aeons even death may die'<br>
<br>

Was she hearing him correctly?  The ruler of the underworld would willingly give up his powers, his immortal life, so willingly and complacently?  This could not be possible.<br>
<br>
::Hades, what you are saying is foolish.  You command powers beyond comprehension, and you would willingly give it up without a fight?  You who understand better than anyone else what it means to be void of life, to be forgotten, like those souls you rule over.  And yet you would welcome such a fate for yourself?  You proclaim that you have asked this very same question, and yet you have not done anything, are not doing anything to change it?  Have you gone mad?<br>
<br>
Hecate stormed around the room, her angry gestures emphasizing her frustration.<br>
<br>
::Are all the other Olympians the same as you?  Do they also share this same ideal? Have you all grown so fat and lazy that you would all welcome oblivion? <br>
<br>
Her ebony eyes suddenly flared up in crimson fire, while tongues of flames erupted from her mouth.  <br>
<br>
Screaming and shouting, she pointed at Hades.<br>
<br>
::I will not be led to slaughter like some ignorant sheep.  I have the power to change my destiny, and I shall.  Within this temple lies the Tapestry of Time, and from it I shall pull my thread.  Those three sisters haved held all of us in thrall for far too long!!  You can do the same Hades.  You can live eternal, never worry about some one else usurping your throne.  But do you have the guts to do so?  Or are you as weak as the others before us, those long forgotten gods that once ruled this world.  As we tore from them their powers, so must we prevent others from doing the same to us.  We are gods, Hades, we control destiny, we are not controlled by it!!

<br>
&quot;Olympian? I do not, nor have I ever lived upon Olympus. I reside as Lord of Tartarus. A place that you yourself live. My wife reveres you as one of her closest friends.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually, most of the &quot;Olympians&quot; would agree with you. They do not want their reigns to end. They wish to be FOREVER. I am the Lord of the Underworld. King of the Dead. Therefore, I inevitably see the end.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have fought to maintain my Throne. I will fight with all my being. But, how do you fight inevitability? So you remove your thread from the Great Tapestry? Then what. You think you will save yourself from inevitability? You remove your thread from that Tapestry, you will nullify your own existence, you Damn Fool.&quot;<br>
<br>
::His voice began getting darker, a bit angrier::<br>
<br>
&quot;You cannot change the future. So make your mark in the present. I am content with ruling the Underworld. It was the straw that Fate handed me, and I shall defend that straw with every ounce of my power. But eventually, Fate will choose when I surrender it. Will it be in battle? Perhaps. Will it be as I sleep in a bed? Perhaps. Only I and the Fates know.&quot;<br>
<br>
::The anger beginning to peak::<br>
<br>
&quot;So, okay Hypothetically. We pull our threads and manage not to blink ourselves out of exisence. We now exist outside of Time &amp; Fate. We become the Rulers of the World for all Time!  Then what? We rule the mortal realm heavy handedly, and deep down the Mortals begin to resent us...they begin to hate us. Then what, slaughter then and Create new ones?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have learned the limit of my power Hecate. And I have surpassed it quite a few times. But, I know better than to push my luck. Have you ever wondered why I have never done what you are planning to do now? Have you ever wondered why the Mighty Zeus himself has not done this? Or perhaps the God of Prophesy himself, Apollo? You think they lack the courage, the 'guts' to do it? They dread the end just like the rest of us.

The words that Hades spoke chilled her bones.  She was almost tempted into believing in the inevitability of their future.  But no, she mentally shook herself, she would not be deterred.<br>
<br>
::Hades, maybe the reason you are here confronting me is because the Fates are manipulating us.  They foresaw that I would be here, and therefore had braided our paths so that they would cross, so that they can use you to stop me.  That will not happen!!  You mention Zeus, but you know how lazy and useless he can be.  He thinks with his groin, not with his head.  He only cares for his next conquest, nothing more.  As for Apollo, he's too young, and like his father, looks towards the next virgin to slate his lust.  But you are different.  Your heart lies with Persephone, and she with you.  How could you condemn her into a fate of anonymity?  I thought you loved her beyond all else, and yet you would allow her name to become sullied and trodden upon by those spineless mortals.  You think mortals can destroy us?  That's preposterous!!  If we hold our destinies, how could the mortals overthrow us?  They are nothing!!  Any one of us can wipe out whole civilizations in a blink of an eye.  And that is why they revere and fear us, because we hold their pitiful lives in our hands.  Why would we willingly give unto others this same type of control over us?  <br>
<br>
Hecate conjured up an image of the night sky, filled with innumerable amount of twinkling stars.<br>
<br>
::In my visions, I saw mortals reach up into the heavens.  They yearn for the power which is ours by birth.  And yet when they tread upon the ether, they find nothing there.  And why is that, Hades?  Because they have killed us!!  Because they no longer believed  in us, and so we had faded away.  We are not there to greet them when they have achieved such greatness.  Instead, they find dead worlds and dead dreams.  Just think Hades.  If we can mold these humans, we can usher in a golden era, not of mortals, but of immortals.  There are worlds out there, amongst the stars, filled with life, yet lacking in guidance.  These worlds need us gods to shape them, to lead them on their evolutionary paths.  But we are relegated to this world, anchored here because this is where our worshippers are.  If we can transplant them onto those worlds, so goes us.  Our powers would grow, our reach unlimited.  No longer would we squabble over the handful of humans on this planet.  No longer will we quibble over who the Amazons worship, over which deity is the patron of which city.  We will have planets and star systems for our playground.  Just think, we will have control over vastness beyond imagine!!  But only if we are our own masters.  <br>
<br>
She points into the darkness within the temple.<br>
<br>
::Yet those witches refuse what is rightfully ours.  Instead they play us against each other, while they laugh at our ineptitude and foolishness.  They are your enemies, Hades, not me.  If you will not do this for yourself, then do this for Persephone.  I know she would agree with me.  For she is a loving wife and daughter.  Would she wish to see the two she loves above all else, fade into inexistence, if she had the power to stop it.  No!  She would not!!  She would fight to the death to prevent such a thing.  But would you?  Would you let your dear Persephone die?  Hades think things through.  Join me and we can reign forever!! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hecategoddessofmagic>Hecate Goddess of Magic</A> at: 4/24/03 8:09:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hypnosofsleep@amazonsunite>Hypnos of Sleep</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://otf.home9.dk3.com/Summoner/images/summons/spirit_of_laharah.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(4/24/03 9:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=313.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> A dream come true?</span><hr size=1> *Hypnos staying in the darkness of of the shadows barely in view, almost being a figure of imagination in the corner of there eye... <br>
 <br>
He listening carefully to each of the sides of the argument... He was somewhat settled with the fact that everything came to an end, but was drawn in quickly by Hecate's point of power forever. We were the gods, and there was achance to become forever almighty... But was it ment to be?The Fate was confusing some times, they controlled everything, yet we still made our own decisions... But if we could just take that Tapistry, and so that they could never cut any of the gods strings... Oh the possiblitys of true imortality. <br>
 <br>
The thought became more and more tempting to Hypnos... A rebirth of immortal power, more appriciation could be recieved, greater power and glory then ever before... A dream come true. <br>

Hypnos's eyes began to swirl and glow a deep shade of blue, and white light. The area around him was filled with his hypnotic pressence.* <br>

(in some sort of subconcious voice of influence) ~Hades... Hades...... Hades.... You can take this chance... Take the tapistry with Hecate...

&quot;Yes, the gods quibble and fight for followers and the beliefs and the hearts of these mortals? Have you ever noticed Lord Hades in ANY of those fights for them. Never. As I said before. 'Everything dies.' And thus when they die, they fall under MY jurisdiction. I have fewer priests than most. Most fear to even speak my name for fear of me hearing them, and yes, I do hear them when they speak my name.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay. Yet again, Hypothetically. We both attain ultimate power. We can do anything and everything. What happens when you and I come to a disagreement? Do we discuss it? And what happens if that does not work? We go to war? We fight...very much like the way the gods do now? Suppose we have our OWN worlds to rule. What happens when these worlds reach maximum capacity and our powers need to grow further? We impede upon the others territory. Fates or no Fates. Conflict is inevitable. The Fates are old. Older than I. I pay them little heed.&quot;<br>

Hecate cocked her head a little to the side.  They had an audience after all.  Judging from the power emanating from the corner, most likely it was Hypnos.  So be it, let him dwell within the shadows.  Maybe Hypnos could be of help.<br>
<br>
::Hades, do you balk at taking this path because you feel everything has to come to an end?  Do you disway me and any other god from following this path, because at the end, when the gods decay and perish, we would all eventually become a denizen of your realm?  Is that what you are going for?  Because you win?  <br>
<br>
Hecate shook her long ebony tresses, and sighed deeply.<br>
<br>
::Hades, you lose at the end.  If all us gods should perish, to whom can you gloat to?  To whom can you show your triumph to when no one else is around to be impressed?  Take the initiative Hades, take your destiny into your own hands.  That's what being a deity, a god is all about.  We rule our own destiny.  If you have sucha fatalistic view, why don't you give up your rulership over the dead now?  I am sure many of the other gods are salivating over what you reign, and none of them would give a second thought in grabbing your powers for themselves.<br>

Hecate sneered at Hades.<br>
<br>
::Well mighty Hades, what say you?  If life is finite, and our destinies predetermined, then why wait til then?  If you already forsee others taking over your governship, then why not step down now?  <br>

Has being a deity dulled their senses, blunted them from the wonders of life, pushed them to seek annihilation?<br>
<br>
It was sad in a sense, so many of them seemed to want to give up their godhood.  If that was the case, then so be it, there was only so much she could or would do for them.  Leave them to their fate then, as long as they didn't stand in her way, she wasn't going to waste any more time upon them.<br>

When I succeed, maybe then it will clear your minds, and show you what bounty awaits all of you.  But if you choose not to, that is your decision, not mine.  Just stay out of my way.

Hecate spins around, and walks down one of the hallways.  As she walks away, she says quietly over her shoulder, but loud enough for them to hear.<br>
<br>
::Our lives are forever entertwined, and we will surely cross paths many many times again.  What I do here, I do for myself.  I hold no animosity to any of you.  But please stay out of my way.  You can either join me or leave me in peace.<br>

&quot;I think you put to much confidence in your Answer, Aunt. For what if I know something that you do not, but how can you say that when you know everything you will ask. It is because I know of plans that Grandfather Chaos has, and you do not know because he is everything, and yet nothing at the same time. He is the upmost powerful being that ever was and is, and he plans to come back to the earthly realm, to get ride of any hinderances to his decendance.... <br>

For all you know Hecate might be here for a reason, Chaos does not want mere fate to get in the way of what things that he wants to be to be... His given name was Chaos for a reason, his order of opperation has no shape or form, so what might seem obvious to you might, but might be something else behind the vail of Chaos. <br>

  <br>
&quot;Chaos would not be here to destroy you, but only use you for the good of his mission... But you take this in a form of negativity Fates. <br>
 <br>
 I know my place well enough, for I know my job is not yet done in the realm of this world.&quot; <br>
 <br>
*Thanatos watched as they worked on the fabric of all life.* <br>
 <br>
&quot;But you forget one thing Aunts...&quot;  <br>
 <br>
*Thanatos reached inside his robe and pulled out a small black knife. He then reached down to where the Fates were working, and oh so carefully began to twirl a thread on the knife.* <br>
 <br>
&quot;I am death. I am already dead. A god's soul born in darkness, already tarnished with the teeth mark's of where life was ripped away. So do not warn of threaten or whatever you would like to call it. I am a factor of humanity that lives outside of the confinments of your tanglement of thread.&quot; <br>
 <br>
*Thanatos laughed to himself again.* <br>
 <br>
&quot;And anyway, if you were to snip my thread, even if you could, my dear cabin fevered Aunt with the shears would be out of a job.&quot; <br>
 <br>
*Thanatos laughed almost now with a insane edge to his voice. Though the Fates were wise, and delt with the lives of mankind, Thanatos was the ones on the front lines growing more heartless and merciless with every souls that he dragged out of its dead body. <br>
 <br>
He then undid the twirled thread and put it back in place, oh so slowly putting it back in his robe.* <p>~*Thanatos*~ <br>
 <br>
For some I am a fearsome being, an assailant... and ending, final and cold. For others a kind friend... A transition, a new beginning.</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thanatosofdeath@amazonsunite>Thanatos of Death</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.joerghuber.com/images/art_c48.jpeg" BORDER=0> at: 4/28/03 12:55:23 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=embraceyourfate>Embrace your FATE</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(4/28/03 9:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=313.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Foolish Thanatos</span><hr size=1> :: Lachesis let out a howl of a laugh::<br>
<br>
&quot;You forget yourself, you are only the personification of Death, not death itself ( according to our ToG bible, the complete idiots guide to classical Myth ). You are a worker for, who can easily be replaced. We hold your thread as well, and if anyone thinks they can come and break these threads, they are as foolish as Hecate.&quot;<br>
<br>
::She looked to Atropos::<br>
&quot;Only she holding her shears can cut the threads.&quot;<br>
<br>
::Atopos looked to Thanatos::<br>
&quot;And the shears will turn to dist, if any, but my own hands touch the shears. You little knife has no meaning, has no disturbance within our tapestry. Keep with the threats, and you will be permenetly thrown from our temple and kept out with magic that Hecate herself could not counteract...We all live, we all die, or fizzle away, and that will be your fate as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
::Clothos picked up a tapestry from a section of the table by them that seemed to not exsist, it shone brightly in silver, unlike the usual golden on, between her fingers she held one string::<br>
<br>
&quot;This is your thread Thanatos...Now tell me if you think you can die or not....&quot;<br>
<br>
