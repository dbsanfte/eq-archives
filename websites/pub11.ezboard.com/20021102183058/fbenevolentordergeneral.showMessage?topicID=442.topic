I offered to make jewelry for the BO and ME raid and then lost my home connection on Halloween and have not yet got it back. I can access net from work but I’m not sure that my promise to make jewelry would justify me logging onto EQ here at work.   <br>
   <br>
  There is a lot of talk now about the Dark Age of Camelot. I feel that description also seems to apply to Benevolent Order all to well. You seem to be creating your own DAoC. <br>
<br>
  Camelot was everyone’s idea of the perfect kingdom. Admired and envied from all on the outside only to be brought down from within. <br>
<br>
  Ben Ord never strove nor intended to be an uber guild in the sense most people perceive it. The ones who joined, the ones we hoped to bring into the guild, placed their desire to make Norrath a better place above any personal gains or objectives. They offered freely of themselves asking little or nothing in return. <br>
Ben Ord was uber only in their devotion to helping others… and how they treated them.  <br>
<br>
  I look at your message board now and see mostly postings from people outside your guild giving thanks to your members for help that they provided. You could hardly ask for a better testament for your guild. I can honestly say I know of no other guild that is spoken so highly of from outside its guild… <br>
and yet continues to speak so low of itself.<br>
<br>
  “Very glad you changed the password to the officer forum, that didn't even occur to me that &quot;others&quot; may be snooping”<br>
<br>
  Since previous officers would be the only “others” that would have access, I can only assume you are referring to them. I agree that you should change passwords periodically however the statement appears a bit paranoid if not offensive. Contrary to whatever the popular belief now held here is, I would hope that anyone that was deemed to have the qualities to make them an officer of B. O. would have better reason to return to these forums than snooping. I would think that anyone that left the guild feeling disdain would have no reason or interest in returning here. I also cannot conceive what you think you have that would give others cause for snooping. There are however, people who once held the position of Officer that return because they still care about the guild, it’s reputation, what it stands for and most of all those who now represent it. As I recall, the most successful raids B.O. held were due in part, if not their entirety, to people who were previous B.O. Officers. That includes a nasty CR that resulted in the whole guild raiding party only being able to retrieve their corpses with the aid of a previous Guild Officer. <br>
<br>
“Be sure you take appropriate caution. Seems like some of the old members, you remember, the ones who left us for fortune and glory”<br>
<br>
  That’s interesting. None of the people that talked to me before leaving gave that as a reason for leaving. Hoping that you aren’t referring to all past members this way for two reasons. One, it is far from the truth, and two, I would hate to think that malicious slander is a trait now associated with B.O. Officers. A large number of people all left within a relatively short timeframe. Do you really think that members who had devoted themselves to the guild for over a year all got the sudden desire to go their separate ways and seek fortune and glory for themselves at the same time? And what of people who belonged to a different guild before joining BO? Will they also be accused of leaving their guild to seek fame and glory with BO? Speaking for myself, for I certainly am not qualified to judge others, I left for reasons of my own that I certainly don’t feel I need to justify but had nothing to do with fortune or glory. The irony is that there are those who left to avoid that way of thinking, not to seek it. <br>
<br>
“well, they are trying to recruit the members of BO into a new guild.“<br>
<br>
It is usually a considered to be a compliment and tribute to your reputation to be invited to another guild. If the rumors are true I am sorry to hear that former members are enlisting members to “Spite” B.O.  I have no idea who is recruiting, but would hate to think that spite would be the intent of a former B.O. member. It just doesn’t make sense. Usually when someone has a problem with a guild it is due to a conflict that person has with one or more of its members. Just as your actions are a reflection of your guild, your choice of guild is a reflection of yourself. What kind of respect can you expect to receive from a person who has no respect for your guild? . When enlisting, you want the very best for your guild, why would you enlist someone just to hurt their guild. Sorry, just can’t comprehend that. I am also just as concerned that this will cause current members to spite all previous members. I am confident that most previous members would still go out of their way to aid and support current B.O. members as well as the guild itself. <br>
Don’t let one (or more?) decide your feelings towards all the rest. <br>
<br>
“I only ask that you be wary of these folks. They have shown us their true colors in the past, and I for one will have no dealings with them.”<br>
<br>
  Hate to see a post like this from a guild whose signature is benevolence. Hurts even more to see it directed toward it’s own members whether past or present.  Hate seeing open-ended comments like this; not sure if this is directed to all past members or to a certain few but it will certainly leave doubt in all past members. If I am included in that I am sorry you feel that way but will respect your decision and wish you all best of luck in all you do. <br>
Offer still stands if ever there is ever any aid or service that I can provide. <br>
 <br>
This was not intended as a flame though I’m sure there are those who will take it as such. I do actually wish the best for B.O. I just can’t perceive how comments like these can hope to bring anything positive to a guild based on benevolence.   I hope I am only living up to my namesake of misperception and these comments are not indicative of the guild or the person. They are certainly not indicative of the good memories I have the person.  <br>
<br>
If I am to apologize it is only for my bad habit of speaking my mind regardless of consequences. <br>

I will try to address your concerns, but frankly your post raises several concerns to me that I find much more disturbing than the issues you brought up.  I am quite upset with your blatant disregard for the privacy of BO and its members on our own message board.  This is the home of BO members and it should be treated with more respect than that.<br>

I was not the one who posted the quote you are referring to here, but I am the one that made the password change.  It was not my intention to imply that we had lingering distrust of former officers or any paranoid reasons.  As I was cleaning up the boards and fixing them up I realized the password had never been changed and I decided to do it while I was already working on the boards.  You make a simple password change sound like something offensive to the former officers.  It was not intended as such, and should not be regarded as such.  End of story.<br>

I just have a few quick thoughts on this one.  You comments on this seem rather defensive....<br>
    1)  If you are not one of those who left for fortune and   glory then this obviously is not referring to you and should not concern you.  We did not name names here exactly to avoid the &quot;malicious slander&quot; you throw out at us as an accusation.<br>
<br>
    2)  This is taken out of context.  It was posted in the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       PRIVATE </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> members board for BO members only.  I assure you, it was speaking of a very certain few people (of which all BO members are aware), but rather than name names we tried to use less offensive terms like &quot;they&quot; and &quot;those.&quot;  The fact is, you have no right to read or comment on this post because you are not currently a member and lack the information we have shared amongst the members regarding this entire post.<br>

This is a very valid concern for someone who does not know the lengthy discussions amonst BO members that have held place.  I feel the officers have tried very hard to let the active members know about this issue and that we still have a great amount of respect for the vast majority of our former members.<br>

This post was meant for BO members who are all aware of exactly who the poster is referring to.  That is one reason why we have a private forum so that we do not have to detail all our posts in such a way that outsiders can understand them.  This was not aimed at all former BO members, most of them are great people and still held in high regard by BO.  We use terms such as &quot;they&quot; rather than name names because we already know who the poster is referring to.  If you take those terms to mean ALL former BO members then you are greatly mistaken.  However, since you have taken the liberty to violate our members only area and comment on it publicly I will share the story that started this post.<br>
<br>
A week or two ago a former member, who I still won't name, logged on a secondary character that had not disbanded from the guild.  This person then tried to pull a scam much like the one you posted Ari.  He announced to us all that we were to go meet him somewhere (I forget exactly where) to get invited into &quot;the new guild.&quot;  This person tried to make the members who were online think that the BO leaders had agreed to merge into this other guild even though he was well aware that BO had turned down the offered merger.  Luckily both myself and brastil were online and caught on quickly and disbanded this person, who then had the nerve to start sending tells to all our members online.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Understandably we're upset with this underhanded tactic and yes we saw &quot;spite&quot; in this move.  If our posts in our private board reflect our anger well, that is a natural human reaction and it was meant to be <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    private</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>    <br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I don't see how you could expect any of us not to percieve this as a flame, by far the vast majority of your comments are highly flammable.  The fact that you mention flaming suggests your well aware of that.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>    <br>
I just can’t perceive how comments like these can hope to bring anything positive to a guild based on benevolence.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Thats exactly my thought on your comments here.  Perhaps I am misunderstanding your intentions with these comments but the only thing I see here is an attack on BO.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lastly,<br>
I am quite upset that you showed the nerve to not only read posts in our members only section, of which you are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>          NOT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> one of, and therefore have no right to read, but you posted comments on it to our public forum.  I respect your offer to help BO and I know how much you have done for BO in the past.  We welcome your voice on our public forums, but reading private boards and posting comments on them will not be tolerated by outsiders.  It shows nothing but disrespect for BO and its members and consequently <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    DOES</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> make you look like a &quot;snoop.&quot;  Perhaps that is why you found that password change offensive.  <br>
<br>
I do not know how you obtained the password to our private forum, nor do I care.  I know the security of these boards is pretty weak.  I have changed the password again and I ask that you respect our boards and refrain from entering forums that are private in the future.  Just because you can obtain the password does not make it right to read the private posts.<br>

However, and as Rensai put it, DO NOT interfere with our inhouse business.

<br>
I have to say that I was truly shocked to see your posting on our public boards, especially by quoting out of context from what we all assumed was a private, members only, forum.<br>
<br>
While I certainly believe you have earned the privilege of visiting BO's board because of your long and glorious past association with the guild, I cannot and will not allow you to gain access to the private forum then post such a diatribe against the guild on its own public pages.<br>
<br>
I have no idea why you felt the need to do this, but you do have a history of posting lengthy dissertations on various subjects.  In the past, you had every right to do so, but now, you are a visitor to this board and I believe you need to respect the rights of the existing BO membership.  You claim to not want to &quot;flame&quot; anyone here, but I can see no other consequences to such a post.<br>
<br>
Please   consider yourself a welcome additon to our posting family, but you MUST respect the rights and privileges of guild MEMBERSHIP.  You elected to leave the guild for whatever reason, so please limit your posts to constructive content or don't post at all.<br>
<br>
Take care Ari.  Hope all is well with you in new guild. <p><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~helmore/germania1.jpg">
