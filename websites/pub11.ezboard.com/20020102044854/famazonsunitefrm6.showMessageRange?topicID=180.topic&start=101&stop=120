Evelyn didnt eat much and gave the rest of her own food to Scooby,who happily ate it up.Evelyn then stood up and walked to the opening of the tent and looked out,and now tears started to run down her cheeks as she remembers seeing that one amazon getting shot with an arrow and dieing.She had kept herself strong during that time,cause she really didnt understand what was going on,but everyone else seemed upset about it,and so she was too.Scooby now clomps over to her and sits down next to her.She looks at Scooby with tear filled eyes.&quot;This ish bad Scooby.&quot;She sniffles then goes to her knees and wraps her arms around Scoobys neck and hugs him tightly as she cries.<br>

She had gotten up from Alysia's side and wandered out into the rain for a walk in her favorite weather.  The rain drenched her down good and wet but she didn't mind at all, it felt good against her blood-boiling skin.  She noticed Evelyn crying against Scooby, but decided to let Scooby lick Evelyn to happiness or whatever the dog had in mind and she moved along the many amazon tents to see how the amazons were coping in the rain and then walked out of the camp many paces to go think on her own.<br>
<br>
She hoped that Dawn would be okay seeing that she had looked terribly drained earlier on. Delilah leaned against a tree dripping with cold rainwater and let the drops from the tree hit her head and shoulders as she looke out at the amazon camps, a few sheltered fires showing through the now torrents of rain that hit the muddy ground.  Yup, this was her favorite weather, but something suddenly crossed her mind... that lion-human being from earlier on.... what was it? who was it? what did it want and where was it now?? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udelilahtragedy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Delilah Tragedy</A> at: 8/24/01 10:04:58 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ukalankash.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kalan Kash</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#993300>(8/24/01 10:24:19 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/kalankash/images/kalan-1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hmmmm</span><hr size=1> ::Kalan realized the dog wasnt coming back to attack him.Suddenly though his attention was deverted and watched as the amazons were attacked by......Centaurs.Not lizard men,but Centaurs!He quickly dodged the flying arrows,and once the centaurs retreated,he relaxed a little,but he was furious that one of the brave and noble warrior woman were killed in the attack.He takes off into the forest leaping over logs and stones with great stealth until he catches up with the rogue centaurs.Quickly then he slows down,lowering himself in a stalking position as he creaps up to what looked to be the leader of the centaurs.He wants to make friends and allies with the amazons,and hopfully offering them the head of the rogue centaur leader will grant him that.With a strong roar from deep withing him,he leaps out of his stalking position,and lands on the back of the leader centaur.Startled the centaurs rears up,and tries to get Kalan off as the other centaurs pull thier weapons.Kalan digs his front and hind claws deep into the centaurs hide,and tears across his back with his front claws,making deep wounds down the length of the centaurs back.And as the other centaurs come closer to defend thier leader,Kalan clutches his claws around the leaders neck,and twists his head ruffly,and with a loud snap,the neck is broken and the centaurs falls dead.Kalan jumps off the centaur and look around at the others,he growls and roars loudly::Back off,or you will be next!::He snorts and grunts,his chest heaving,he was serious,he could take the other centaurs out if he wanted to.Seeing that Kalan was a large human/lion breed,something the centaurs wouldnt have seen before now,they took his warning and fled.Kalan snorts once more and looks at the dead centaur leader.::You brought this upon yourself. ::He bows his head,as he kneels and with his front left claw he carves a small mark in the centaurs flank,and in a forign language says a short prayer that will release the centaurs spirit in peace.He often did this,no matter how much he disliked any of his victims.He then pulls from the band of his loin cloth a dagger,and cuts the head from the body of the centaur.::Go in peace,your spirit is free. ::He stands,then returns to the site where the attack was,and realizing the amazons have moved on,he follows thier trail.Bringing with him the head of the centaur.::<br>

How she wished she could leave... but Alysia had been right there to help her when the war between Ephesus and the Nitewings was unfolding.

She looked to Evelyn's tent and sighed silently. She needed to get her away from here. This was nothing a seven year old should be seeing. Any of it. And she would talk to Evelyn about going back to Ephesus or anywhere else tomarrow morning. For now, though, the thoghts of the war crept back into her mind. That horribe feeling she had... the death of that Amazon earlier... all of the others potential deaths... she raked some hair out of her face, wiped some water off her forhead, and shut her eyes tight, but not to sleep.

Not being much for the ground, all her years being in the out posts of Themiscrya, it was spend in the trees.  She found one with a good nook and leaned back in it.  Marpe was not far from DeLerium, so she was satisfied with it.  Her sleep was soft and never heavy, this was normal.  The guardian's ears were tuned to the slightest sound even in her sleep.  Once and awhile, she would glance at her Themiscryan athelfi, making sure they were alright.  And then settle back into her slumber.<br>

Awaiting everyone's awakening, quietly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=daphnikearephiparthenia>Daphnike Arephi Parthenia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#993300>(8/25/01 11:44:15 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://mrmagoo.fortunecity.com/royo/secret/secret03.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The feline avenger</span><hr size=1> Daphnike looks at the Centaur head Kalan is bringing and says to the half lion.<br>
<br>
&quot; Thanks for avenging my athelfi's death but it was my duty to avenge Alcippe! It's their chief...But I'll never find peace before I have at least one of those filthy Centaurs on my kill list!What are they doing, do you think they'll try to avenge their leader?&quot;<br>
<br>
The Amazon wasn't in mood to pardon to the Centaurs and in herself, she was saying:&quot;Just come and you'll all die!&quot; If the Centaurs would come, she would reserve them no pity.<br>
<br>
It was the first time she saw an half-lion and with her feathered war mask, the young Amazon was looking like a bird woman.She looks at the creature with fascination and admiration.But she wasn't in mood for friendship.Daphnike was one of the Themiscryan warriors who came to the Northern lands to participate to the Saurian wars and Alcippe's death affected her.She would never see the world the same.Before, she thinkt that the Amazons and Centaurs could coexist in peace.Now she think that her nation must destroy the Centaurs and that they can't coexist peacefully.<br>

<br>
She glanced away from him as Delilah came forth bringing a human-lion with her. Alysia stood and looked to her sister.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will speak with him Delilah, efharisto.&quot; She nodded to her athelfi and looked to the creature.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you have a name??&quot; She asked him.<br>
<br>
Alysia removed her war mask revealing Tiger striped paint upon her face. She was called the Clan Mother of the Odusians, the Tiger species. She had a feeling that this. . .  lion could be of some help to her and her people. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 300<br> <font color=#993300>(8/25/01 12:46:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Coming to battle.</span><hr size=1>  Dawn had awoke early, back in her body at Themiscry. Emeralds were weak at first when she glanced around the brightly lit pine forest and then to her tigers. At that moment she knew she would be of no help to Alysia unless she went to the war in the flesh. That was just what she did.<br>
<br>
 All four of her large black paws hit the dirt floor and took off. It'd only be a half days travel in tiger form.<br>
<br>
*Later that Day*<br>
<br>
 The exhausted demonic tiger padded into the camp, of weary amazons rallying together to fight. Just like the ground of the camp, Dawn was muddy and wet, her fur matted to her flesh. The tiger's emerald orbs glanced to everyone around the camp, before making her way to the Queen's tent. <br>
<br>
 Upon the tiger's arrival into the tent, and not knowing the circumstances of who was in there, the tiger glanced to Alysia, and nodded. About that time, the room fell pitch dark, like battle at midnight. . and when the light reappeared in the room, and everyones eyes adjusted to the light once more, the amazon assassin stood before them. This time in the flesh.<br>
<br>
 Dawn was dressed in her usual amazon attire, with more weaponary though. Clad in her leather pants, and corsit, as well as her elven boots. Upon her thigh was a knife, sheathed, and around her ankles were the usual four daggers. Upon her back was two swords, in the diagram of an X, each hilt was available with the flip of a wrist. On Dawn's left shoulder was a shielding, with a tiny glimpse of a knife hilt, that was quick to access by the warrior. On Dawn's opposite arm was the bold marking of Ares, the only tattoo seen on her body. The other LaTra tattoo usually shown was covered by her black guantlets, that covered her forarms. <br>
<br>
 Those bold emeralds glanced to Alysia.<br>
<br>
 &quot;No way am I letting our son fight without both of his mothers. Besides.. this isn't the place for Belle to make her first kill.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn smiled faintly, before glancing over her shoulder to look at the camp once more. The assassin fell silent as she looked back at Alysia, that's where they had remained her entire time, on the LaTra. After her silence she nodded once, as she settled down in a chair, near the map that she began to study.. muttering only a few words for her athelfi.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Bonded for life.&quot;<br>

She went outside and went over to Ariah who seemed to still be awake though the sky was lightening yet still raining in torrents. &quot;Have you any idea how to take Evelyn away from here?&quot; She crossed her ams over her chest and looked over to her hut where Evelyn slept with Scooby. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=180.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=180.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=180.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=180.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=180.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a> <b>6</b> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=180.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=180.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=180.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=180.topic&start=181&stop=194>10</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessage?topicID=187.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessage?topicID=184.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=180.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.threadControl?topicID=180.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=180.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=180.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm37">The Mythical Odyssey Forum<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitefrm32">The Mythical Odyssey<option value="amazonsunitefrm35">Amazon Nation Alliance<option value="amazonsunitefrm33">Character Descriptions<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm30">Amazons of the Sacred Circle<option value="amazonsunitefrm34">Amazons of Lesvos Island<option value="amazonsunitefrm38">High Mountain Tiger Clan<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm28">Amazon Sisters of Cremni<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm31">Amazon Language<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> -
