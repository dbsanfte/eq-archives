With the help of her guide, Cyrene made it to the temple steps and was awed into silence.  Taking a deep breath to gather her courage, she stepped into the massive temple.  Great care was taken on her part to make sure not even her steps were heard.<br>
<br>
Instead of heading to the large alter, the older woman moved off to one of the gardens.  There, she knelt down, removing the amulet from around her neck, and placed it as an offering to the great goddess.<br>
<br>
Lifting pale eyes to the sky she managed to speak. &quot;H..Hera...please, here my call. I seek your advice. I...I don't wish to.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Hades!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she cursed to herself.  Knowing the goddess would see her heart, she continued on with the truth, no matter how offensive it might have seemed. &quot;I can't turn to the other gods.  I..really don't care to know them. You are the goddess that holds my last bit of hope.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lowering her eyes to the simple amulet in the grass, she took a deep breath and held it.  Eyes sliding closed at the thought of the loss, yet for the goddess' wisdom, it was hardly a loss. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ulionessofhera.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lioness of Hera</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#993300>(8/31/02 11:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm54.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/sing.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A humble visitor.</span><hr size=1> A strange blood curly roar was heard behind Cyrene, the sound rumbling thru the temple.  <br>

Outside the temple a pride of lions prowled about the front gardens.  One of the priestesses nodded in respect to one of the golden beasts.  It was a lioness who slowely moved away from the pride and towards the steps of the temple.  It's large paws moved with a strange elegance as it padded up the stairs and in thru the front doors towards Cyrene. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=cyrene>Cyrene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#993300>(9/1/02 12:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm54.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/cyreneamphipolis/cyrene005.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A humble visitor.</span><hr size=1> The older woman thought that she'd heard the sounds of movement drawing closer.  When she glanced up at first the didn't dare believe what her eyes told her. Then the roar was heard, her ears siding with her eyes and with the combination she understood that there was not only one lion, but a pride.<br>
<br>
As one drew closer pale azure grew wide in fear, she'd never seen a lioness this close, only once as a child with her family as they traveled.<br>
<br>
Trembling, she lifted her palm to the base of her throat, but didn't dare move.  Perhaps she shouldn't have come, maybe this was punishment for her mortal plea.

The only claws and fangs that were on her body, where now decorated jewelry.  &quot;You seek Hera in hope?&quot;  Sin asked curiously as she stood a couple feet from Cyrene.

&quot;Yes, I seek strength in the goddess' wisdom.&quot; Reaching down for the necklace she'd offered the goddess, her hand moved away quickly and she stood, leaving the offering behind. &quot;Yet I fear I don't know the proper manners of asking such a favor.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ulionessofhera.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lioness of Hera</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#993300>(9/2/02 5:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm54.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/sing.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A humble visitor.</span><hr size=1> &quot;I am not sure there is a one and only way to speak to Hera,&quot;  she walked closer and offered her hand to the woman.  &quot;I am Sin.

Then her eyes trailed back to Cyrene's.  &quot;All you need to do is speak to this idol.&quot;  Sin waved Cyrene's eyes to the large golden peacock that stood at the top of the dais.  &quot;Hera will hear your message clearer.

Glancing between the idol and the woman before her, the older woman quirked a brow, then glanced at the pride of lions moving about.

When she reached the island's shores Cyrene found her boat waiting there and a hand to offer help back to the main ship.
