Poseidon turns his gaze to the the 3 goddesses Eris mention in turn. <br>
<br>
Hera he knew was very beautiful, however she never held his attention. Aphrodite was a beauty and Poseidon still did not get over her, since the day he saw her in bed with Ares. Athena was stunning, he'd love to get down and dirty with her if not for her sworn virginity.<br>
<br>
One of the gods tapped Poseidon on the shoulder and asked him who he thought was the fairest. Poseidon's eyes again fell on all 3 goddesses as he thought about it.::<br>

She rolled her eyes at the mere thought until she caught sight of that apple.<br>
<br>
She looked around at her step-mother and sister and saw that they two were looking at it's brightness. She heard a mumbling through the crowd as the other guests too tried to decide amongst themselves who was the fairest.<br>
<br>
Most automatically said Aphrodite for she was the Goddess thereof. Others softly spoke Hera's name in honor of the Queen. She turned and saw others chanting her name on towards her. She briefly let go of Nike and made her way closer towards the others.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come now Eris, this is ridiculous . . . a game between the Gods.&quot; She gave a small laughter at the thought as she looked back to those speaking her name as the fairest.<br>
<br>
And so Eris' game began to play out. For even Athena gave into the temptation of such a treasure, of such a title.<br>

'Well Persephone, I guess she uses her girdle for those men who have no interest in woman. You know the kind Zeus seduces at times and kidnaps from their families to serve him on Olympus. Or maybe just to boost her confidence because some goddesses are as beautiful as her or more so. Take Athena, the goddess of war, look at her. Her face is as fair as the moon on a clear night and her body is curvacious and fit. It will drive some gods wild just looking at her maybe goddesses too, who knows?'<br>
