Both of them began look around.  They were unsure of where the trial would take place.  <br>
<br>
Slidding off her horse, Hippolyte handed it over to Marpe who had joined her on the ground. <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

She perked up and stood. Going against the bars of the cell, she tries to peek outside as best as she can. She cant see anything...so she stands on the bed and peeks through the window and sees Hippolyte of Themiscrya come...she gasps. &quot;Oh boy...another Amazon Queen has arrived....thats not good&quot; Eve said to herself.<br>
<br>
She then sees an Amazon Warrior enter the jail with a plate of food...not much, just like a slice of bread, grapes and water. Eve looks through the bars and sees the food and licks her lips, has been starving for hours. &quot;Is that for me?&quot; Eve asks the Amazon. &quot;No, its for the invisable people in the jail&quot; The Amazon sarcasticly said, rolling her eyes. She opened the cell door and entered, putting the plate of food on the bed. &quot;Enjoy, its gonna be another few hours before u get more food...&quot; the Amazon said...then leaveing the cell and locking it....<br>
<br>
Eve looks at the food and grabs it very aggressivlly. Chopping on the food like she hasnt eaten in years!... The Amazon giggles seeing Eve eat...&quot;Enjoy&quot; The Amazon said....eve looks up, &quot;Thanks!&quot; Eve says with a mouth full of food. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uheroicxena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Heroic Xena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#8A2BE2>(8/23/02 3:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=154.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:</span><hr size=1> Xena watched Maytha leave the jail,then as she were to go inside and see Eve, Gabrielle showed up. She turns,looking at Gabrielle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi.&quot; She sighs. &quot;Eve's in jail....again&quot; Motions with her head toward the jail.<br>
<br>
&quot;Apparently the amazon Varia(adangelsx) was murdered,and Maytha saw the vision of the murder in her mind.&quot;<br>
<br>
Xena went silent for a moment before continuing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now,I don't doubt Maytha's visions,and theres a 99.9% chance Eve did kill Varia.....sometime before I killed Eve.&quot; Quirks a brow,then sighs again.<br>
<br>
&quot;So,did you just come to Sarmatia to visit,or did you recieve word that there was going to be a trial?&quot; Xena eyed Gabrielle questioningly. Then peered over to see Maytha chatting it up with (Empress)Xena;narrows her eyes slightly,then catches a glimpse of Hippolyte entering the village.<br>
<br>
Xena rubs the back of her neck. Knowing this trial wont go by so easily as she thought. She would have to do some serious defending on her daughters behalf.<br>
<br>
She returns her gaze to Gabrielle,again with that questioning look on her face. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenvaria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QueenVaria</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://hometown.aol.com/variaavande/images/tsianina2.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 581<br> <font color=#8A2BE2>(8/23/02 4:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=154.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/cristalc15/images/varia3sm.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Not me!!!</span><hr size=1> Varia (the still living one, apparently, O.o...) rode into Sarmatia on Blade, and screeched to a stop outside the jail.
