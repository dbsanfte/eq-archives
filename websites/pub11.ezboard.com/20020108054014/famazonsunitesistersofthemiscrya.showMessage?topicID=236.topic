Dawn stood, keeping her balance some 50 feet or so in the air. <br>
<br>
 Her weapons were gone from her body, sitting in a pile at the tree.. she looked almost suicidal as she walked to the dge of the limb. Most would rather it that way.. Amazon Assassin gone mad.. just like some always believed.<br>
<br>
 Dawn put her hands togather in front of her, outstretching her arms. Emeralds looked at the water fall that the tree was along, the river flowing down. <br>
<br>
 An manical grin spread across her face as she jumped, her arms going first, palms pressed to eachother. Emeralds never flinched, feet folding straight. <br>
<br>
 Dawn dived into the air, never moving her body's form, until she went crashing into the water, her body then began to swim up to the top.<br>
<br>
 It was actually, a really smooth dive, no big crash. None at all really, and from the height of the tree, and then the height of the water fall.. you would have imagined more.<br>
<br>
 Dawn hadn't gone insane, but more just felt like diving. No matter what the Amazon Assassin was quiet...<br>
<br>
 Leathers were pulled off, in the water, as she stood, shoulder deep in cold, crystal water. A black, soaked heep was made at the bank of the river. Dawn had tossed all, but the black bikini swimsuit underneath, to the waters edge. <br>
<br>
 No one had ever seen the Amazon relax so much, as right now.<br>
<br>
 Back under the water she dived, her feet coming up, as her head went down, and began to swim. Emeralds watching the fish, and other creatures. <p>Pyschotic injustice
Mommy made me this way
Evil and hungry
I'm just a craving soul
Craving for your blood and death; M'Dear
Don't worry it won't hurt..
Just a dagger or two.. 
Crimson spilling onto my hands..
Running over the flesh to drip from my elbow
Scarring the black leather pants..
Mmmm its yummy
Don't worry I only strike once...
Don't bother to scream... they won't catch me

Some could call her somewhat of a protective guardian over Dawn, others just a plain stalker, but either way it seemed that, wherever Dawn was, so was Sartha. But what others thought mattered not as she watched Dawn. Those silvery-golden eyes of her flickered with little expression, but a small smile could be seen on her face::<br>
<br>
::Sartha sat back on the bank and her flute appeared before her. She closed those haunted eyes of hers and played. It wasn't a sad song, or an eerie one. It was something like a journey, if anything. Many elements were mixed into the music she played at that moment. Perhaps this was a sign of how Sartha expressed herself. As long as Dawn was happy, she was in good spirits, just like a guardian force::<br>

Neither needed the gaurdian ship, but they needed the friendship. Anymore the two Amazons were inseperable. Lately though the fights had gotten more and more.. things between them were changing and Dawn hoped for the best. <p>Pyschotic injustice

If anything, the fights just bonded them more closely, and they seemed to stand on the same side most of the time in the end. Sartha would hold on to her Athelfi, no matter what. Dawn was the friend Sartha had never had before. The Amazon Assassin understood Sartha like no one else could, and she accepted what Sartha did without question. They had true trust in each other, and that is all Sartha needed. Dawn was her Athelfi, now and forever:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessage?topicID=233.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessage?topicID=235.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.emailToFriend?topicID=236.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.threadControl?topicID=236.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=236.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=236.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm37">The Mythical Odyssey Forum<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitefrm32">The Mythical Odyssey<option value="amazonsunitefrm35">Amazon Nation Alliance<option value="amazonsunitefrm33">Character Descriptions<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm30">Amazons of the Sacred Circle<option value="amazonsunitefrm34">Amazons of Lesvos Island<option value="amazonsunitefrm38">High Mountain Tiger Clan<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm28">Amazon Sisters of Cremni<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm31">Amazon Language<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya>Sisters of Themiscrya</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
