Grabbing her arms, he slammed her back into the pole and tied her.  &quot;I guess I need to get you fed.  Your no good to me starved.&quot;  <br>

He turned and stepped to the door of the hut, motioning for guards to come and watch Hippolyte.  And then he dissappeared.<br>

Hipp was now truly weak.  She couldn't hold her head up, for the loss of blood and strength.  It had been many days since she had eaten back in camp.  <br>

Alexiares did not know who this woman was, but it was clear to her that the woman was an amazon of importance.  Even more so, the woman wore a golden belt that signified she was a Queen.  <br>
<br>
Glancing to the guards, she didn't dare speak or tell the amazon who she was.  Alexiares had kept it quiet over the year she had spent as a captured slave.  Picking up a bit of the bread that soaked in beef broth in the bowl, she tenderly lifted it up to the amazons lips.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=odessaofpaphos>Odessa of Paphos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Queen</span><br>  Posts: 212<br> <font color=#993300>(4/27/03 2:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm66.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=183>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/xvmegvxwpt/images/amarice_11.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Attack Begins</span><hr size=1> Odessa looked to the Wolf, blinked,a nd then ran to Solari<br>

It was sad to see her eyes downcast to the floor.  But, the anger that it brewed inside the queen seemed to give her a little more strength.  <br>
<br>
As the woman lifted her head and looked at Hippolyte, she could see the surprise in her eyes.  But, didn't say a word.  Parting her lips, she gently took the food from the woman's fingers.  Hippolyte knew the food was surely not the best, but at the moment it tasted incredible.  She ate each bite offered.  Thankful to have something to eat.  She gave the woman a soft smile.  Then whispered, &quot;What is your name?&quot;<br>
<br>
Then Hipp felt a thud in her battered side that took her breath away.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Don't speak to the slave, Beast!&quot; ordered the guard who had hit her with the blunt end of his sword.<br>
<br>
Hippolyte tried to catch her breath, the pain in her side was just too much now. <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

She gathered the reins and looked out over those who were standing and already on their horses, ready for their orders. <br>
 &quot;Elektra.&quot; Solari said. &quot;You and Marpe will get Hippolyte out and back here to safety. The rest of you, fight with honour and courage.

 She reached out to take the sword that Marpe held ready for her. Smiling, seeing that it was a Roman short sword. <br>
&quot;No harm is to come to the man responsible for taking Hippolyte.&quot; She commanded, looking at everyone once more to make sure that her orders were heard. &quot;I will take care of his capture and then he will be given a dose of his own medicine.&quot; She raised her sword, seeing it glitter in the firelight. &quot;Now, to arms my sisters....its time to bathe in Roman blood.&quot; <br>

She placed it one, then gave the signal to ride. They left the village quickly and quietly, as amazons do. The wolf that had came, led them to the village. Upon the forests' edge, the amazons waited. Solari knew that a full head on charge would result in a bad attack. She also knew that the men were expecting them by the way they were acting.<br>
 She gave a wolf howl for Alysia to join them and to let her know they had arrived. Now, it was just a matter of moments before the amazons would reclaim their queen and slaughter the Roman men, save for the one who took Hippolyte. Solari tried not to think of the idea that amazons didnt take slaves, but this was one exception to the rule in her mind. She looked to her fellow amazons, nodded to Elektra and Marpe to get ready. <br>
 &quot;Archers, to the trees.&quot; She said softly to those amazons who were with bow and arrows. &quot;Take out those on the edge of the village. Those of us on horses, will ride into the heart and stop its beating.&quot; She could feel the blood lust burning in her veins. &quot;The rest of you follow and kill at will. We are here for the men only. Women and children are not to be harmed. No mercy for the men!&quot; <br>
 Once again she gave a call to the wolves, giving the air a erie feeling as more and more wolves answered the call. The rain had subsided to a light drizzle. On her orders, arrows flew from the darkness of trees and into the hearts of the guards posted at the village's edge. And with them falling, Solari made the charge call and the thundering of hooves could be hears in the mud, along with the calls and growls of wolves surrounding village. <br>
 Entering the village at full gallop, Solari was first met with another Roman, with whom she decapitated in one swift move of the Roman sword from the man she had known and killed earlier. The other amazons in horseback were also quick to dispose of those few Romans that were stupid enough to attack an amazon on horseback. Solari pulled her mare up suddenly, sliding in the mud as she saw they were at the heart of the village and surrounded by Roman soldiers. This was a unexpected, but welcomed move by the men. She dismounted her mare, motioned for the others to do the same and stared directly at the large man in front of her. <br>
 &quot;I'm here for the man who took the amazon.&quot; Solari commanded in a deep voice from behind the mask. She made no mention of Hippolyte being a queen, knowing full well that something like that would end her life. She kept her eyes on the man in front of her and those surrounding. Finally, the man in front of her spoke up.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 &quot;I am the one you seek beast!&quot; He said coldly. <br>
<br>
Solari gripped the sword even tighter as her eyes narrowed on him. Her muscles began to tense up, ready for the strike. With one loud voice, she called out, the amazon war cry...not only for her fellow amazons there, but also for Hipployte. The attack began. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sheyala>Sheyala</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 468<br> <font color=#993300>(4/28/03 12:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm66.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=191>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Found and hunting</span><hr size=1> It seemed that it was Anya who knew first where to go. The wolf followed friendly howls and messages, taking Sheyalong for the ride. That was, until Shey recognised Solari upon her horse. Smirking she pulled her bow off of her shoulder, nocked an arrow and slunk to the trees. &gt;Carefull my friend...&lt; She thought to the wolf as she aimed, and let loose on command. One after the other men that looked like long standing blur to her fell to the gentle humming of her arrows. Red feathers blended with splashes of blood. As the barbed tips hit thier marks.<br>
<br>
Occasionally a blur of silver darted between the rushing amazon women on horseback and she smiled knowing that Anya too was having her lot. However all of this made her sad. Shey was enthralled to be again on the battlefield. It was where she belonged, which was an awful thing. &quot;Please bring Hipp back Solari...&quot; she whispered as she continued to empty her quivers of arrows.<br>

She turne to Arixa who joined her side.<br>
<br>
&quot;Call back the others, if any hunger, let them feed at will.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that, every hidden wolf in the area gave a loud mystical howl and darted into the village tearing at the men as they could. Alysia herself liked the taste of the high generals, so since Solari said not to harm the one who took Hippolyte, Alysia took off after his second in command.<br>
She grinned as he aimed a spear at her, his eyes widened when she lept into the air and caught it in her teeth breaking it in half. He turned around to run but before he could make it anywhere, the white wolf Queen was on his back tearing and ripping her teeth into muscles and nerves.<br>
<br>
When he was dead, she looked around as her wolves and athelfi bathed the ground in blood. Odessa was among them, and the pride in her heart grew so much.<br>
She gave a loud howl in honor of the amazons and then turned away making her marks back towards where Solari stood.<br>
<br>
Alysia gave a nod to Solari and stood about 15 feet away from her and the Roman. Alysia wanted to watch this, and make sure that if any other Romans came near Hippolyte's hut, Alysia would be their killer. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hippolyte>Hippolyte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Platinum Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 900<br> <font color=#993300>(4/29/03 7:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm66.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=194>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/Hippwknife1ezboard.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Attack Begins</span><hr size=1> The sound of the amazon charge upon the village, startled the two guards.

<br>
 &quot;Why dont you show me your face witch woman!&quot; The Roman barked. &quot;That way when I kill you along with the other one, I can relish in the domination that I have defeated you.&quot; <br>
<br>
Solari growled and plunged the sword into the ground before lifting up her war mask and tossing it to the muddy ground. <br>
&quot;No man dominates me.&quot; <br>
<br>
And with that she grabbed the sword and rushed towards him, making contact with his sword as he countered her swing. The sword fight was on. The whistling of arrows flying by and thuds of bodies slaping the wet ground could be heard. The cries of wolves and the fear of men mixed in with the blood-curling screams of those fortunate who met a sword's death was music to the amazon's ears. <br>
<br>
&quot;You are skilled with a Roman sword, witch.&quot; The Roman said, breathing heavily at this time from the sword blows Solari had been giving. <br>
<br>
&quot;I have many skills.&quot; Solari said, then swung her sword, having it blocked and then grabbed his arm, flipping him over into the mud onto his stomach. <br>
<br>
She was relentless in her 'punsihment' on him at this moment. Anger flowed freely through every ounce of her body. She kicked his sword away from him, then kicked his face, knocking him over. She wanted to end his life, then and there; but knew that the kill belonged to Hippolyte. She let the Roman get to his feet.<br>
<br>
&quot;What, you can't kill a man witch?&quot; He spoke, spitting out blood from the broken jaw he now had. <br>
<br>
&quot;Your death will come soon enough.&quot; Solari said. &quot;But first, pain will be your pleasure.&quot; And she punched him in combination with swift kicks until he fell backwards, unconscious.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elektraamazon>Elektra Amazon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#993300>(4/30/03 11:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm66.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=197>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/ddelektradd/images/smelek.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Attack Begins</span><hr size=1> Elektra had become alive again in the battle.
