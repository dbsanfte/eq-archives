Having not known about her Queen's death, she sat atop a limb, it hung from the tallest tree in Themiscyra. She could see from the middle of the village, everything that went on, and as the sun rose, Dawn saw a glimmering blade. It was centuar made.<br>
 She softly dropped from the tree, creeping through the town she came up to the head Centuar. He was in the highest command of the Centuar Army that was headed into the village. Dawn giggled lightly, waving to him from a mere foot away.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Hey there ugly thang.&quot;<br>
<br>
 He groaned lowly looking at Dawn, as she gave the loudest war cry. It rang out through Themiscyra. The Head Centuar promptly gave a go ahead movement for the rest of his army to go ahead. He and Dawn were left to fight the war against eachother, while the rest fought to save the village.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I never thought to see you again, my old enemy come back to haunt me. Apparently you did run the last time the war came around.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn laughed as she had yet to pull her sword, but hands were tight around it, green eyes burned deeply with hate against the male centuar that she saw before her.<br>
<br>
 &quot;They really have poor taste Dawnithnia..making you lead an army.&quot;<br>
<br>
 He chuckled, as his eyes ran over her body. Causing him to have second thoughts (again) on fighting his long lived enemy.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Look whose talkin'. Tisk Tisk Pobre.&quot;<br>
<br>
 &quot;Let's just get this over with, Dawnithinia. No need for me to stand here and watch, when I can kill you instead.&quot;<br>
<br>
 &quot;Thats a laugh in a half.&quot;<br>
<br>
 He growled at Dawn's comment. As he drew his second sword.<br>
<br>
 Dawn growled back toward him, drawing two swords to match his two. She couldn't believe how this neighbor from her old lands, had been her friend. Though she knew, she just couldn't bare to think it. This man had fallen inlove with her, and when she rejected him, he had become a skilled warrior, wanting to kill her. <br>
<br>
<br>
(Here's my one rule. NO ONE interrupts Dawn's fight with this dude. NO ONE saves her, or kills him! You leave them be.!) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualcippe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alcippe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#993300>(12/14/00 5:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: º·.¤.·°The Centuar War in the Villageº·.¤.·°</span><hr size=1> :::Alcippe followed Dawn to the edge of the village.  She pulled out both her small swords and stood ready.  Soon, two Centaurs rushed as her. The warrior flew into a fury of blades, spinning and kicking. The centaur fell from a blade cut to his neck.  The other one smashed his staff across Alcippe's shoulder.  She grimaced and flew one sword to his knees cutting him down.  As he fell, the other sword slashed across his face. She pulled back the first sword and then sunk it deep into his chest.  He fell down to his death.

It was Hercules and he was fighting the centaurs.  Alcippe chuckled under her mask.  She remembers having fought Hercules several years ago.  These centaurs were defiently doomed, between the warrior hearts of the amazons and the hero of Greece.  She looked back to see a Centaur running just underneath her.  She flew down on top of him, riding on his back.  With one of her small swords she quickly grabbed his head in hand and slashed his throat.  This action made him fall crashing to the ground and Alcippe quickly flipping from his back to stand before him.::: You would think the Centaurs would learn. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualcippe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alcippe</A> at: 12/15/00 10:10:49 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Queen</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#993300>(12/15/00 5:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Pobres vs Dawn Round 2</span><hr size=1>  After days of several returned attacks between Pobres and Dawn. Finally an attack would be devlivered, not one that Dawn would recieve lightly. <br>
<br>
 During the latter few hours of the fight both warriors had lost a sword...and all be damned if Dawn had taken the lose happily. She had growled angrily with the minor defeat. Her sword was stuck deeply into a tree stump, and now Pobres had decided to attempt and slice her stomach. The move Dawn had contered it with, still left her bleeding, just not as much. Her counter move, had consisted of the one she had taught Wulf. The palm of her hand had caught around the sharpened blade of Pobres, clasping it she twisted the blade, snatching it from his hands. Then it was launched across the village.<br>
<br>
 &quot;And you thought I was weak. Poor Centuar!&quot;<br>
<br>
 Those had been the only words Dawn had spoke, as she had thrown the sword, then promptly the hilt of her own sword was slammed against the Centuars torso. He grunted fiercly as he stumbled, stunned. Upon regaining his stance, a sword was snatched from the tree.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Ah but I'm not Dawnithinia. You thought I was beneath you all those years ago. When I loved you, now I just love to hate you.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Queen</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#993300>(12/17/00 8:46 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Round 3</span><hr size=1>  &quot;I really thought we had something going!&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn snickered with the scarcasm, she had gained from the long hours. Her sword was twirled lightly, as she launched herself into the air, landing on Pobres' back. <br>
<br>
 Grinning as she felt the adrenline give one last kick into Dawn's blood. The thrill of her preparing to kill was to much to handle.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Poor Poor Pobres..you're finally cashing out of this fight, permentatly.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn had barely let the words slip from her mouth, when the centuar reared into the air. Throwing Dawn off balance and into a quick thought mode. Sword slammed into the spine of the Centuar, as her last definate move, she then lept from his back, falling a few feet behind him on her own back. Quickly she flipped forward, spinning on her heal to look at Pobres.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I had planned a slower death than that.&quot; She grunted.<br>
<br>
 Pobres' blue eyes looked up into her eyes, with fleating life. He had fallen to his knees, with the pain, and was about to tumble to his side. It would be almost a complete hour before he was finally dead.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Now you'll be beneath me for all eternity. I hope you enjoy the stay in Hell.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn stepped towards him, back handing him across the face, multiple scratch wounds showed the latter path. She walked along his side, twisting her sword deeper inside his spine, then just as had been put there, it was wrenched from him. Her left elven boot, came up from the dust, quickly sending multiple kicks into his side, and inner organs. Promptly starting the internal bleeding of those that had not started.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Enjoy your death in silence, scum.&quot;<br>
<br>
 With that Dawn dissappeared from the battle site, walking in toward the village. She needed more warriors here, or they would have the village destroyed. <br>

She would fight for them forever. Suddenly, a Centaur rushed at her, and she pretended not to notice.  As he came upon her, Alcipped turned and smacked his legs with her weapon.
