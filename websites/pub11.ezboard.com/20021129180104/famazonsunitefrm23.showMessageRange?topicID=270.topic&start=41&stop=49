But through the figure that looks like everything and every shade of black at once. The figure seems to have no shape of any fiugre of the rest of the people in the room, but of a swirling mist... but some sort of face appears out of the mist and has the eyes of eternity, and if you starred into them long enough you could see all the power that has ever exsisted in the universe. <br>

From the essence of nothingness, the creature that brought every element of the universe into exsistence came into the room for he senced the power that once was within him, but yet at the same time still within him... <br>

Ares smiled as he looked around,nodding to Bia, yes, he did remember the feisty protector of his father. He nodded to those around him who acknowledged him. A slight jump as Hecate snaked her arms around him , hands hanging on his arse. A chuckle escaped his lips.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well Hello Hecate....I see you are well.&quot;<br>
<br>
He cut himself off as Alecto and Megaera came over to him, slipping from Hecate's arms. A wide grin on his lips.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahhh, the beautiful Enrinyes. It is wonderfull to see you again. No Megaera my dear, I have not forgotten you, or you either Alecto.&quot;<br>
<br>
He slid his arms around there shoulders and looked around, finding Tisiphone, one who did not come to say hello. He simply grinned at her, then winked.<br>
<br>
&quot;So tell me, you terrible twosome...what have you been up to?&quot;<br>
<br>
As he spoke, he caught sight of his sister Eris, playing with the fear of some poor cupbearer. He slightly chuckled, that poor boy....he thought to himself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugoddessbia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goddess Bia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1560252154.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(10/5/02 6:04:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=270.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.phoenixarises.com/wof/royo6.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> ~ Bia laughed to herself..........   ~ so fiesty am I?  and this from war himself haha ~ she looked towards him with a knowing look and an arched brow...... he knew better.......... then she flashed a dazzling smile...<br>

A smirk on her lips. She was amused by something else off the Mountain. Looking around, she smiled. it had been to long since she had seen her family gathered. Okay, so, some of them where not worth her time. But blood was blood, and her blood was worth her time. She walked to Hera and Zeus and greeted them. It had been so long since she had seen her father and step mother. After exchanging few words with them. She walked to Gaia and her children, the Furies. She bowed to Mother Earth and smiled. "Greetings Earth Mother."  <br>

Looking around, she spotted Athena, one of the only tolerable kin of hers, besides Apollo, ofcourse. She walked to her step sister and smiled.  "Athena its been so long...How do you fare? Well I hope."  <p>~ The Silver Goddess~<br>

He walks away into the large crowd and tells one of the servants to clean up the mess on the floor where a cup-bearer had spilled some drink, while pointing over to it. <br>
<br>
The God moves on as the immortal servant goes to carry out the order given. Then Poseidon bumps into Bia, physically, and stops. He looks at Bia curiosly with the noise rumbling about them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pardon me. It's almost chaotic here I did not notice you.&quot; He steps back to give the goddess some space and clears his throat before speaking again. &quot;In all good will welcome and enjoy yourself I'm so glad you could make it here!&quot; His eyes flash over towards Ares and the flirtatious goddesses about him.  <br>
<br>
The room darkens as the all-embracing precense of the immortal Choas is become manifest at the feast. The God looks past Bia and turns around searching for the god whom he eventually spots over by Erebus.<br>
<br>
Turning back to Bia Poseidon says, &quot;I see all the ancient immortals are come here as well. Good to see them they hardly join in the festivities of the Olympians. Your enjoying yourself I hope?&quot;<br>
<br>
Artemis walks by and after Bia nods to her Poseidon waves to the daughter of Zeus. It seems Artemis does not notice him and the sea god stands there looking like an idiot. He does not even notice Hecate leaving, he is supposed to meet with her later, he'd catch up with her before he leaves. <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And
