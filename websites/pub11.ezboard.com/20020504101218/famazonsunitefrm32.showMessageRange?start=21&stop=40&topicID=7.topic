His form resting on top of the horse as he waits his hands tightening against the reins of the horse. To his right a new companion, a large brown grizzly, the monster was big enough to make a group of ten men tremble with fear.  It's body was atleast five feet tail maybe ten on it's hind legs it was a truly powerful animal.<br>
<br>
         His horses nostrils shooting jets of white streams into the air, on it's sides a quiver of spears holding at least ten deadly spears. He himself was covered in a strange collection of armor. His pants covered in a thick rawhide. His boots made over the same material but the shins covered with a thick metal sheet. His chest covered a strange armor of chains strapped together over his chest. The shiny metal was coated with black ash.<br>
<br>
          He was the only male on this side most likely, but against gods it mattered little. His wrist were covered with two different looking gauntlets one gold and the other silver. He had his mystical blade over his back the runes seemingly glowing with power. His was ready for this the tension in the air was electric and the immortal was ready to try his hand.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualastorofancients.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alastor of Ancients</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/14/01 5:04:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://caspervandien.net/sleepyhollow/themovie/photos/images/indeximageov.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Heh</span><hr size=1> (( that was me just forgot to switch a post thingy.. )) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 394<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/14/01 5:07:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..The Norseman..</span><hr size=1>  Dawn shifted some atop the saddle of her horse, feet fitting loosely and edgy into the stirrups. Although she looked nervous, and paranoid, inside she was focused. For yards, maybe miles, her ears could hear the shuffling of prepared feet, and the snorts of a rather angry horse. <br>
<br>
 Underneath the war mask, lips formed into a cynical grin. Even a hint of those defining emerald eyes showed underneath the layer of crimson that coated her eyes. It was hatred and blood lust, blood shed and killing, that covered the truth in her soul. <br>
<br>
 Hearing the snorts once more, Dawn glanced over her right shoulder, a brow raised at the presence of Alastor on their side. Logic tugged into her mind, everyone would think he was there to betray him, but the aura he gave off told otherwise. <br>
<br>
 A simple nod was given to the norseman, and his horse, before Dawn turned her head back to face forward. To face the gods. [I'm not honoring any NPC's.] There was.. let's see.. Hecate, Eris, Poseidon, Hypnos, and Fogstone. The assassin couldn't help but snicker, glancing to around at the amazons.<br>
<br>
 Yup, they were all the ego manics each one of them had proven to upset, because they couldn't get their way, outside of their cushy life, and spoiled world. But then, they had been the stupid ones to try and intimidate the amazons. <p>

As he walked he slowly uttered the ancient prayer of his people. <br>
<br>
  &quot;Lo, there do I see my father <br>

They bid me take place among them<br>

His face dark with the passion of war. In his right hand he held the sword of war which he swung with great ease. Walking to the centre he took the sword and smashed it deep into the ground, where there was a massive rumbling before he withdrew it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't tell me you decided to fight a war without the God of War, although I must admit I'm in a bit of a dither to which side I should be on. After all I am some of the Amazon's fathers, and my favourite assasin is there as well. But then they wouldn't want to me to fight with them beause they want to stand up for themselves and I don't blame them. Then of course there are my fellow gods, who have manipulated, tricked and decieved people for years...I'm really at a loss here!&quot;<br>

Letting those whose ego's were scratched make the first move. <p>~~<<<<<<{{{{@</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualysiaofscynthia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alysia of Scynthia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 278<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/15/01 3:18:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Gaia</span><hr size=1> She turned to her fellow Queen and smiled.<br>

She smiled. The Northern Amazons knew Gaia as their true patron. The first Amazon. The first woman. Gaia was their foremother.<br>
<br>
She glanced over to Hippolyte lightly and smiled as she saw Hera appear on their side.<br>
<br>
&quot;Today shall be a joyous victory.&quot;<br>

&quot;The Amazons have Ares on their side.&quot; She noted. Though she and Ares had many quarrels, he was the God of war as she the Goddess of such. She knew his powers and devotion to his daughters. <br>
<br>
&quot;It's a shame that the others,&quot; speaking of the Gods &quot;will regret these moments here. For they know not how badly they could fail.&quot;<br>
<br>
She too knew that some amazons would be hurt, or lost. But she had faith that they would still live in their nation. Once a God is destroyed in spirit, he is lost forever. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=royalfogstone>Royal Fogstone</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/15/01 6:28:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gods</span><hr size=1> (Has everyone posted, or entered the subject so that we may start the war?) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 395<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/15/01 6:47:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gods</span><hr size=1>  [Hold your horses, and let us have some fun.]<br>
<br>
 Dawn grinned, although it couldn't be seen, she grinned from ear to ear. Crimsons travelling to the center of the battlefield, at the appearence of the god. Then a sidelong glance was given to Hippolyte, and then a shrug of her shoulders in mild consideration of what had just happened infront of them. <br>
<br>
 Then her eyes went to Sartha, her mask lifted from her face, and for a few moments, it was the true side of Dawn that showed. There was not hint of worry, or doubt, pure force and guts, the true Dawn, no blood lust.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I'll see you on the otherside.. no matter what side it is. I'll see you, sister.&quot;<br>
<br>
 There was no amazon language to hide her feeling, it was the bond they had. Not just amazon but beyond that world..through everything.<br>
<br>
 The mask was then placed back over her face, the amazon shifted slightly in the saddle. She could sense them all, Athena, Ares, Hera.<br>

He then turned away, and then suddenly out of his normal outfit, a new outfit sprouted. the outfit wasn't as exactly as cool as Hecates, but it was his own style. He had a dark silver face mask that had a large saphire incrested on the front with seven small ones around it. <br>
<br>
Also on his mask was a star and moon design, also the face piece was outlined with obsidion, along with the two eye slits. His chest plate was dark silver and decorated with a moon, stars, and clouds, and the chest plate extended on the solders for protection... His sleeves and pants were dark purple velvet, and mixed in with chain link.  <br>
<br>
His ganlets were dark silver with a star designwhich covered the dark purple gloves, along with the shin protectors which were on dark purple boots. His cape was a dark blue. His whole outfit was very smooth and rounded going with his own element. Yes Hypnos was ready for war.*** <p>~*~*~*~*~Thè göd öƒ §|èèp~*~*~*~*~        </p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=hypnos>Hypnos </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 11/15/01 7:43:32 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamazonqueenyakut.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amazon Queen Yakut </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/15/01 7:47:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gods</span><hr size=1> Yakut sat quietly upon her horse, she was preparing herself.
