Then he glared at Sheyala, then lauched himself from the ground, swinging with his right hand for her stomach, having dropped his sword. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/usheyala.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sheyala</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 266<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(8/18/01 7:52:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=134.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://geocities.com/Tokyo/Pagoda/8446/mononoke_poster.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thirst for bloodshed</span><hr size=1> ::she looks at him skeptically.  almost like he was nothing more than a foolish impudent whelp  she pulled her staff out of it's sheath just as he lunged.

Dymastar grabbed it with his left hand. &quot;How, how could this be. You're, you're hurting me, and him...Madmartigan, how could...how could he be fighting back. This is impossible!!!&quot; Dymastar struggled and he seemed to be fighting some inner fealing brewing inside him. He knew he had little chance of fighting back against Sheyala. He stared angrely at Shey, then the blue light that was in Madmartigan's eyes floated out and formed into one ball.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll get you one day, i'll be back,&quot; the ball of light said.<br>
<br>
Madmartigan's face seemed to return back to normal. He seemed shocked and surprised to be there. He was hunched over, with his head to the ground, still holding his arm. He slowly raised his head to look at Sheyala. Pain was evident in his face and he seemed a bit confused too at where he was. His eyes started to glaze over and he started to wobble.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shey?&quot; It was the only word that came out of his mouth.

Had he have given up hope and let Dymastar tap all of his power, Shey might have been dead now, but he hadent. He looked from his arm, then to Sheyala.<br>
<br>
