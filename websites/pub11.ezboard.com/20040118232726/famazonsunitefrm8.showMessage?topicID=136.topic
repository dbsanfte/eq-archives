Alysia-Samsara took off into the woods and then as Hpoe searched for the runes and markings of ancient amazon. A foot was sent into her back knocking her over most likely. Alysia glared down at her.<br>

&quot;You... you should not be here this isnt Scynthia.&quot;<br>

She frowned that her plan had been interrupted. Hope had waited til just the right moment when the guards would be farthest away from one another. And now she had been found. That was very annoying.<br>

&quot;I would expect no less from Lucifer. The moment I sat upon Hell's throne even briefly he must have sensed true competition. No matter. His time is closer at hand than he thinks. As for you...&quot;<br>

&quot;...I would remind you that I have done nothing yet that is a provable crime except borrow a few markings for my studies. Studies which would prove very beneficial had you the wisdom to accept my earlier generous offer to council you against the darker gods who hold interest in Amazon lands.

&quot;Queen Maytha. I see that your lands are in fact very well kept. So be it... I should have realized not every tribal grounds would welcome opportunities I could provide for them. But know this. Despite what you might hear of my interests, I am tied to the Amazon lands. All of these Amazon lands. I am a daughter of the Nation. Some may say it but a technicallity but I have heard of Caste Rights passed over to those of far less in the sisterhood. My mother for example.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Know that there are other powers out there which will soon set their sights on these lands. Lucifer, Ares, Juride, Carrion, and many more. They do not seek understanding and influence as I do. The will try for domination or destruction. In such a time when dark godly powers fall upon your lands, one who understands their ways would be of great service.
