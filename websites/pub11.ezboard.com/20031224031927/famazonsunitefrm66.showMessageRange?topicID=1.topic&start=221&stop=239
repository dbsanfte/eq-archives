It was called Wolves Blood, Alysia's greatest invention. She created it along with Sariah back in Scynthia from herbs that only grew in her lands. And it worked better than any mortal medication known.<br>

&quot;This should be more to your likeing when you wake up.&quot; She growled softly as the knots were tied tightly. <br>

Once Solari was satisified with her work, she walked back over and sat down near the fire. The log was wet and cold, but it didnt matter. The pain in her body was slowly returning and the coolness felt good to her body. She sighed softly as the rejoycing began from the victory.<br>

Holding her skirt up a bit, Alexiares brought into the camp wild mushrooms and cabbages that she found growing under the trees.  <br>
<br>
She brought it over to the campfire and knealed down.  Cleaning each bit of food gently to prepare it to cook for those who rescued her.  <br>
<br>
Finding an empty pot, Alexiares picked it up and tossed in her findings.  With a little water poured in, she set the pot near the fire.

<br>
&quot;I agree, slaves in an amazon city are not well to do with. However, I'll take those three.&quot; Points to the ones that the wolves guard.<br>

&quot;If you all would like to come to Scynthia to see them disposed of, you're more than welcome.&quot; She smiled softly and then turned to Odessa.<br>

&quot;Of course Odessa, in fact, you can have one for yourself if you'd like.&quot; Alysia grinned and then looked to the wovles and Tahira.<br>
<br>
&quot;Those who go to Scynthia, we leave now. I want to get through the gates before the melting snow from the mountains floods the rivers.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked back to the other Queens.<br>

Her mind still racing from the attack earlier. The pain from her wounds was now pounding, as she looked down to see her freshly seared wounds, glowing red. She sighed softly as the pain shook thru her body, then reached around to search for something inside her pouch on her belt. Pulling out a small vile, she pulled the cork out and drank down the liquid. It was cool and sweet going down her throat. <br>
&quot;Who is going to take first watch tonight?&quot; She asked looking up at those around the fire. &quot;I do not wish to be awakend with a sword to my throat by one of these prisoners.&quot; Her glance was cast in the direction of the Roman commander she had tied up.<br>
The food that was being prepared was beginning to smell really tempting.

I believe I must take care of some things in Themiscrya.&quot;  Hipp glanced to the man tied up and then back to her athelfi.  &quot;You be careful on your journey...and&quot;  Hipp's face softened.  Then she stepped forward and gave Alysia a gentle hug.  Something Hippolyte rarely did.  As she held her friend and sister, Hippolyte whispered, &quot;Efharisto...may the Goddess and your ancients keep you and your decidents safe and prosperous.  For I owe you so very much.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Then letting her go, Hippolyte seemed to reclaim her quieter side.  &quot;I believe many of us are finished here.  I shall stay the night and help those women who wish to leave for their homes..or follow us into the Amazon Nation.  From Themiscrya I can set them up to decide where they would like to go....for the Nation is large and strong.  They have many places to chose from.&quot;<br>
<br>

Gently, Solari reached for some and was grateful to be eating. The pain was now gone, thanks to the liquid she had taken earlier. She sat there, staring into the fire once again, growing quiet. Her mind was slowing down, as was the adrenaline in her system. There was much to be done now, as she looked up at the families that had followed her and the others into the encampment. <br>
The families that followed had the look of scared animals upon their faces. Having just seen a group of women attack the men that had them 'enslaved' would probally scare anyone, Solari thought. Solari didnt hate men, as some of her other amazon sisters did; rather hated what some did to women. In some small way, Solari felt sadness for these women and the children, knowing that in the victory of being free, their lives were now beginning in a whole new way. One that would be harsh and full of trials. <br>
She turned her gaze back to the others around the fire. She thought about her own daughters, waiting on her back in Themiscyria. It was time for her to return to her duties. But not until Hippolyte was ready to return. She would make sure that her queen would return safely to the village.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alysiaofscynthia>Alysia of Scynthia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 427<br> <font color=#993300>(5/27/03 6:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm66.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=239>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ....</span><hr size=1> Alysia smiled as she took off after Hippolyte's hug.<br>
