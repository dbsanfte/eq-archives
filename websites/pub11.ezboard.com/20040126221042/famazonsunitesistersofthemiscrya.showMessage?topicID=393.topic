I left the silly emotes and ooc bubbles for all to amuse and laugh at.  Glad to have Solari back!))<br>
<br>
You are in "AU Amazon Tavern:1" ( Welcome to My Room )<br>
<br>
hippolyte_sot turns around and faces her friend. "So how have you been enjoying the new amazons?"<br>
amznsolari Smiles softly... "Well, not too many have approached me yet, guess i look too scary for them"<br>
hippolyte_sot chuckles, "Yeah scary ol Solari"<br>
amznsolari giggles and walks to the bar<br>
amznsolari: "But those that I have seen, they seem to be ok"<br>
amznsolari chuckles in amusement<br>
amznsolari: ((cool emote! lol))<br>
hippolyte_sot: "I am proud of the ones we have, the amazons seem to be well bonded now. It is a shame anyone who tries to go against us."<br>
hippolyte_sot: ( I know I love it)<br>
amznsolari yells "Hey Kool Aid!" and crashes into a brick wall<br>
amznsolari: (sorry, lol)<br>
hippolyte_sot: ( rofl )<br>
hippolyte_sot: ( it gets addicting lol)<br>
amznsolari busts a move<br>
amznsolari: "What do ya know, I can still dance!"<br>
hippolyte_sot raises an eyebrow at Solari dancing<br>
amznsolari laughs out loud<br>
hippolyte_sot: "I sure wish DeL was here."<br>
amznsolari: "She would find it funny too that I was dancing."<br>
hippolyte_sot: (brb)<br>
amznsolari: (k)<br>
amznsolari ponders the meaning of life<br>
hippolyte_sot gives Solari a look..."You endaksi?<br>
amznsolari smiles happily<br>
amznsolari: "Yeah"<br>
hippolyte_sot: "Well, you just have a funny look on your face," walks over to the bar to find a drink.<br>
amznsolari flirts with the room<br>
amznsolari: ((lol,))<br>
hippolyte_sot: (( lol slut ))<br>
amznsolari: ((lol))<br>
amznsolari screams, "They killed kenny!"<br>
hippolyte_sot she handsprings over the bar and then begins to search for a bottle of wine. then turns and gives Solari an odd look. "who is Kenny?"<br>
amznsolari chuckles in amusement<br>
amznsolari: "I havent a clue...but mun thought it was funny>"<br>
hippolyte_sot: (( do you have a mic and speaker?))<br>
amznsolari: ((I have speakers, but the mic isnt hooked up))<br>
hippolyte_sot: (( ohh ok.. cause I just said hi lol))<br>
hippolyte_sot: "So, your speaking in voices now, Solari?"<br>
amznsolari: "Yeah, its my new talent! " <br>
hippolyte_sot finds a bottle of red wine and pops the cork.<br>
hippolyte_sot: "That sounds kinda kooky, Solari"<br>
amznsolari chuckles in amusement<br>
amznsolari: "Well, you know, i never was a 'straight' amazon."<br>
hippolyte_sot: "Have you told Terrayus about this?" <br>
hippolyte_sot laughs out loud<br>
hippolyte_sot begins to drink the wine right out of the bottle.<br>
amznsolari: "I havent seen or spoken to Terra since the day after I returned."<br>
amznsolari: "And then I saw Vel at the festival, I figured she was with her."<br>
hippolyte_sot: "She kinda is a loner it seems lately."<br>
amznsolari mumbles incoherently<br>
hippolyte_sot raises a brow. "Don't like that combo?"<br>
amznsolari: "Well, she has always been way, kind aon her own."<br>
hippolyte_sot nods " I know. The mysterious Terrayus." <br>
amznsolari: "Don't get me wrong, hipp.. I want Terra happy..."<br>
cyreneamphipolis joined the room<br>
hippolyte_sot takes another sip from her bottle of red, as she heads over to a table to find a seat. ((waves at Cyrene))<br>
amznsolari smiles happily<br>
cyreneamphipolis: (:breathless::made it. ::waves back.))<br>
cyreneamphipolis: ((may I enter the room IC?))<br>
hippolyte_sot: "I know you do, we all do. And since I haven't heard any complaints I guess she is ok."<br>
hippolyte_sot: (( yes ))<br>
cyreneamphipolis: ((ty<br>
amznsolari nods<br>
amznsolari: "I suppose hipp...i suppose."<br>
hippolyte_sot finding a table, Hipp places the bottle of wine upon the top and then pulls the chair out from under it. "Vel seems to be being a good girl.. lately."<br>
hippolyte_sot sitting down, Hipp relaxes and takes her wine..another sip of the warm liquid running down her throat.<br>
cyreneamphipolis: "Don't look at me like that." Cyrene gently scolded her mare as she tied the beast to the post. "I can go to a tavern for fun, not just to work." The stocky mare snorted and nudged the older woman's shoulder before she offered a pat to it's neck and she entered the tavern a smile tugging at her lips.<br>
amznsolari "Vel and me...there is just bad blood between us....."<br>
hippolyte_sot: "I know Solari."<br>
amznsolari: lops down on a bar stool and grabs some water.<br>
amznsolari: ((What the hell ??))<br>
hippolyte_sot as Cyrene entered the tavern, Hipp looked up to see who it was. It was the woman she saw at the festival in Themiscrya. She smiles to her, "Yasoo."<br>
amznsolari waves at everyone in the room<br>
hippolyte_sot raises a brow at Solari waving and then looks to Cyrene.<br>
cyreneamphipolis: Smothing the trail dust from her palms, pale azure darts twards the direction of the voice. "Yasoo." A dazzling smile was offered in greeting as she returned the wave, then moved over to the bar to gather a mug and bottle for herself.<br>
amznsolari looks back at hipp.."Just being friendly."<br>
hippolyte_sot chuckles in amusement<br>
hippolyte_sot: "I know Solari." Hipp turned her brown eyes back to Cyrene. She stood up and walked over to Cyrene. "Miss, " she said in respect...to the elder woman. "I am sorry I didn't get to speak with you at the festival. I am Hippolyte of Themiscrya."<br>
hippolyte_sot offered a hand to the woman.<br>
amznsolari takes a drink of water<br>
cyreneamphipolis: "Goddess bless.." the older woman hissed under her breath as she leaned over for the bottle, and found herself standing on her own skirt. "If I was ten years younger, I'd try a shorter one." A slender ebon brow arched as she spoke softly to herself, then gave a startled sound and stood up quickly. "aaahh.."<br>
cyreneamphipolis: Blinking hard, the older woman actually blushed and cleared her throat. "Sorry about that. Hippolyte, I am Cyrene of Amphipolis." Pushing the thick bangs out of her eyes, she blinked twice. "Wait. Queen Hippolyte?"<br>
hippolyte_sot smiled at the woman as she heard the soft sorta curse. "Careful..you never know when one is around." She gave Cyrene a wink and then nodded at Solari. <br>
hippolyte_sot: "Yes, Hippolyte.. the Queen of Themiscrya."<br>
hippolyte_sot: "It is very nice to meet you Cyrene of Amphipolis."<br>
cyreneamphipolis: The older woman looked like she might just have become speechless, but the look didn't last long. Taking the Queen's arm she bowed in respect. "It's a pleasure to meet you."<br>
hippolyte_sot: "How are you liking Themiscrya? Hipp shook the womans arm in warrior fashion. Her palm gripping the older woman's forearm.<br>
cyreneamphipolis: Cyrene seemed familar with the grip and returned it, showing hidden strength. "Well so far, I'm finding it more peaceful than some other lands I've visited. Nothing against those lands. I just don't have the stomach for much."<br>
cyreneamphipolis left the room<br>
amznsolari waves at everyone in the room<br>
cyreneamphipolis joined the room<br>
cyreneamphipolis: ((I have no idea what happend.))<br>
amznsolari sings, "Tell me what you want, what you really, really want"<br>
hippolyte_sot: ( lol that is ok)<br>
amznsolari: ((lol, sorry, having too much fun with emote thingy))<br>
hippolyte_sot raises a brow at Solari and then whispers to Cyrene. "You will have to excuse Solari.. I think she has continued to drink since the festival. ( lol ) "<br>
hippolyte_sot: "Solari...come here.. and meet one of our newest villagers," she waved Solari over to join them at the bar. <br>
cyreneamphipolis: Glances past Hippolyte's shoulder to the woman in question. "Maybe she just doesn't know it's over." A teasing brow was arched.<br>
hippolyte_sot tho she was a bit worried with how crazy Solari was being...she wanted Cyrene to meet a respected "elder" of the tribe.<br>
amznsolari: "I'm not drinking anything but water, hipp."<br>
hippolyte_sot: " Uh huh..whatever you say, Solari."<br>
amznsolari joins her friend." I am Solari...<br>
amznsolari: ffers her hand:<br>
amznsolari: ( I hate my keyboard)<br>
cyreneamphipolis: Accepts the offered hand and gives a firm shake and a warm smile. "Cyrene, nice to meet you."<br>
hippolyte_sot she chuckled. "You may be right Cyrene." Hipps smirked and patted her Solari on the shoulder. <br>
amznsolari: "Likewise."<br>
amznsolari Cuts hipp a look, just remember, you might be queen, but i can still whoop your butt! "<br>
hippolyte_sot: "Solari is an elder in Themiscrya...tho she is younger then I am," Hippolyte introduced Solari. "She is one that DeL and I seek council with on important matters.<br>
hippolyte_sot raises a brow. "Well..the right place.. right time...and we shall see."<br>
amznsolari hops up on the bartop...<br>
amznsolari Solari smiles widely and chuckles.... "I'll keep that in mind then dear. "<br>
hippolyte_sot glances back to Cyrene. The woman was much older then most who journeyed to join the amazons. Hipp was very curious about her...it seemed important to know about this woman. "What made you come to live with the amazons.. if you don't mind my asking."<br>
cyreneamphipolis: Takes in a slow breath, depthless azure guarded only for a moment. "Well, it's a short long story." A brief smile appeared, but it wasn't as bright as before. Taking hold of her mug she sipped thoughtfully, as if wondering where to start.<br>
amznsolari sips on her water.<br>
hippolyte_sot: "Well, I suppose if it is long.. you could tell me at a later time. I am just curious," Hipp leaned against the bar. There was something very familiar about the woman, but she just could get a clue on what it was. She knew she hadn't seen this woman. <br>
cyreneamphipolis: "My daughter, she should have been an Amazon, but the fates turned a different thread for her. Though her friend, did become an Amazon, a Queen, and my granddaughter became her heir. The stories she used to tell me. Gods, it sounded so unreal, and yet. Well, anyway, I left my tavern to find out for myself. Though I have to wonder. Can I really call myself an Amazon without lifting a weapon to defend the beliefs I will carry?"<br>
hippolyte_sot: "I like to learn about those from beyond the Nation..and to know what is going on," she stopped to take a sip of her red wine. resting the bottle on her lips and letting the warm liquid flow down again. Then her brown eyes glanced back to Cyrenes. "I don't venture far very much... I have prices on my head and belt."<br>
hippolyte_sot: "Of couse, you can call yourself an amazon..not every amazon is a warrior," Hipp smiled softly. "A village cannot be run by warriors."<br>
amznsolari chuckles in amusement<br>
amznsolari: "Sorry, that wasnt meant at what you said hipp... <br>
hippolyte_sot just shakes her head in amusement at Solari. "It is so good to have you back in the village again, old friend."<br>
cyreneamphipolis: "I understand this. And yet find myself wondering. Anyway, after Xena and Gabrielle disappeared with Eve, I really didn't find myself wanting to stay in Amphipolis any longer. Not after the gods destroyed most of what I had." She added her voice faultering. "Everything I had."<br>
amznsolari smiles happily<br>
cyreneamphipolis: ((brb afk))<br>
hippolyte_sot: ( ok )<br>
hippolyte_sot glances to Solari and then back to Cyrene. " You do know that the Gods have returned."<br>
amznsolari Nods.. "yeah, i have heard the rumors...although I have yet to see my mother."<br>
hippolyte_sot: "Athena seems to have dissappeared..at least from the Amazon Nation." Hippolyte frowned. She didn't feel it was a good thing and prayed they had not fallen in disfavor. "They have build a temple to her in Myrine.. I hope it brings her return."<br>
amznsolari Thinks momentairly.. " I didnt see that temple on my way back, but then again, I wasnt really looking for it either...<br>
cyreneamphipolis: "Yes, I heard. Maybe that is why I've...oh..the talk of an old woman." Yes, she was older than most, yet she seemed much younger than her years, and yet to look at her eyes at moments like these, you would think she was as old as time herself.<br>
hippolyte_sot looked at Cyrene curiosly. "Your not all that old, Cyrene. Besides...many of us look up to the elder women in the tribe."<br>
amznsolari: " And being older does have its adavantages. " <br>
cyreneamphipolis: "I'm old for my life." Was the simple reply, yet it dawned the return of the woman's smile and the brightness in her eyes. "I hope to get to know alot of the women here, I don't know alot about the world, just my little corner of it."<br>
cyreneamphipolis: "So you said you have a price on your belt?" Quirks a slender brow, "this have something to do with Herkules?"<br>
hippolyte_sot frowns, "Well, I hadn't heard that he wants it as well. Mostly I have a price on my head by some Roman Armies. I haven't pleased them all that well. They want me to hand over Themiscrya."<br>
cyreneamphipolis: "Before I left a bard came to town weaving a tale of Herkules and the Amazons, something about a girtle. I ddin't listen much. He wasn't that good of a bard. When you've heard the best, you just can't settle."<br>
amznsolari says, "Pardon me, do you have any Grey Poupon?"<br>
cyreneamphipolis: Looks rather confused and glances at Solari.<br>
hippolyte_sot chuckled. " I suppose not. Tell me..what gods came and destroyed your village." Hipp walked over to a table to sit down comfortably and waved both Solari and Cyrene over. This talk was very interesting. Well..expect for the odd things Solari said from time to time. But, Hipp was getting used to it.<br>
amznsolari Slaps mun... " Stop that!" <br>
amznsolari Looks to Hipp and Cyrene... " Sorry."<br>
amznsolari loks down at her mug of water.. " Wonder what's in this?"<br>
cyreneamphipolis: "What gods didn't." Cyrene grinned at Solari and winked. "They came for my granddaughter. Athena leading them."<br>
amznsolari Arches a brow at the mention of Athena. <br>
hippolyte_sot: "I believe I had heard of this....this was for Eve, correct." Hippolyte sat down at the table and leaned onto it a bit. Her elbows resting on the old table.<br>
hippolyte_sot: "Why exactly did Athena want Eve?"<br>
amznsolari hops down off the bartop and poured herself another glass of water. <br>
hippolyte_sot wonders if Solari should keep drinking water.<br>
cyreneamphipolis: "Somehow, from what Xena tells.....told..me, is Eve gave her the power to slay gods. So to keep the Twilight of the Gods from happening, they were to kill Eve as a child. My daughter and her soulmate were killed defending Eve, though she died as well."<br>
amznsolari mumbles while looking at amznsolari<br>
amznsolari: " Ok, thats it.. mun and I need to have a little talk...."<br>
amznsolari mumbles incoherently<br>
hippolyte_sot sat there quiet for a moment. She wasn't sure what to say..slowely she took another sip of her wine from the bottle. Her brown eyes glanced over at mumbling Solari and then back to Cyrene.<br>
amznsolari: " Alright, everything is under control now...sorry. Mun has been away for a long time and this makes her feel like a little amazon in a weapons store."<br>
cyreneamphipolis: "Needless to say I'm not fond of the gods at the moment. Accept for Hera...she from what I understand, was one to defend Eve. I don't know...who am I, as a mortal, to question the gods, but..." Cyrene grew quiet and stared down into the shadows of her drink.<br>
hippolyte_sot: "Cyrene...Xena and... Gabrielle...are alive. As so is Eve," she glanced at the wood of the table, where her fingers ran along the grooves for a moment and then looked back to Cyrene.<br>
amznsolari: " Just wait until I find mother. " Solari said softly as she sat down next to hipp.<br>
cyreneamphipolis: Standing up quickly, the small woman glared, her mug spilled across the counter. "I don't care if you're a Queen, and I don't care that you could kick my ass faster than I could run. I saw them....I saw them..how dare....how DARE you say something like that." Palms shaking the older woman stepped back.<br>
hippolyte_sot glanced at Solari and then back to Cyrene. She didn't feel it was her place to tell Cyrene who was Solari's mother.<br>
hippolyte_sot she saw the woman's quick uneasiness over the information. Quickly Hippolyte stood up and walked around the table offering her hand to the trembling Cyrene. "I did not say this in jest, Cyrene. It is the truth. The Fates work oddly these days."<br>
cyreneamphipolis: A single tear fell as she reached out to grasp the Amazon's hand. "Y...you would not lie? Swear to me on all you hold dear?" Desperation in her voice, fire flared behind those icy orbs as she held Hippolyte's palm in a fierce grip.<br>
hippolyte_sot could feel the strong grip on her hand. "Yes, they are alive.. as is Eve." She glanced at Solari then again to Cyrene. "Tho many things have happened since you must have last seen them."<br>
hippolyte_sot: "Eve is on trial ...again."<br>
cyreneamphipolis: The older woman sits down hard and lets the Amazon's hand go. "I don't understand...how...how can they keep playing games with my life!" Covering her forhead with her palm, Cyrene lowered her eyes, the tips of her ears darkened as her shoulders shook faintly.<br>
hippolyte_sot shrugs her shoulders slightly. "They play with us all. And have brought back the Gods...from the Twilight." Hipp's brown orbs watched to see how Cyrene held onto this news.<br>
amznsolari Arches a brow at the words, pondering where her mother could be hiding<br>
cyreneamphipolis: With a shake of her head, the older woman lifed her eyes. Her composure regained, she offered a faint grin. "I appologize, my children have been the only thing I've been willing to defend by any means. It's been a long hard road from where I started. I didn't mean to take it out on you. Please, accept my appologies."<br>
hippolyte_sot: "I understand, Cyrene, "Hipp gently rested a hand on Cyrene's shoulder. "Xena is very lucky to have a mother like you."<br>
cyreneamphipolis: "Hmmm.." there wasn't a vocal reply, but a brief moment of regret did appear in the older woman's eyes before it was quickly replaced. "Thank you."<br>
hippolyte_sot: "Parakalo," Hipp sits down next to the woman, now a bit more relaxed. "I wish my mother was around. Xena is very lucky."<br>
amznsolari gives everyone a big hug<br>
amznsolari: " Just felt like you needed that Cyrene. The hug I mean. "<br>
hippolyte_sot raises a brow at Solari, "Efharisto...Solari. That was sweet."<br>
cyreneamphipolis: "Hmph, I've never had a problem adopting." The older woman replyed and placed a warm hand atop of Hippolyte's. "Any woman would be proud to call you her daughter." Looking to Solari. "Thank you. How come I feel that hug from you is a presious gift indead?" Her smile was warm.<br>
amznsolari smiles softly and winks at Hipp. <br>
hippolyte_sot smiled tenderly at the elder woman. "Efharisto, you are so very sweet," Hipp didn't know what to think. She never had a mother...other then being brought up by Hera. So, she wasn't sure about it. <br>
hippolyte_sot grins at Solari. "One never knows with her."<br>
amznsolari smiles softly and sits down again,<br>
amazonrhiannon joined the room<br>
amznsolari begins to hum softly.<br>
amazonrhiannon: <br>
hippolyte_sot: "Cyrene..what do the Gods think of you? I mean..you had a scuffle with them...in your village."<br>
hippolyte_sot: (( waves at Rhia ))<br>
amazonrhiannon: (( waves back at hippolyte))<br>
cyreneamphipolis: "I think they realize that I'm a loyal mother who won't take anything from anyone, even the gods. Then again, I think they might just think that I'm a woman who was a thorn in their side for....two seconds."<br>
hippolyte_sot chuckes at amznsolari<br>
hippolyte_sot: ( oops i mean just chuckles)<br>
amznsolari arches a brow at hipp: ": I certainly hope you dont mean the throw up on me." <br>
hippolyte_sot: "Well..Cyrene..as you long as your with me.. I doubt you should run into too much trouble. I always have someone I can talk to on your behalf. And she might calm them down. One never knows."<br>
amznsolari laughs at amznsolari<br>
hippolyte_sot: ( rofl I meant chuckles )<br>
amznsolari: " By the gods... " chuckles<br>
cyreneamphipolis: "I need a drink." Cyrene excused herself for a brief moment to refill her mug and moved behind the bar to compose herself once more.<br>
hippolyte_sot Hipp watched Cyrene for a moment as she took off to the bar. Then whispered to Solari. "You don't think I said teh wrong thing do you?"<br>
amznsolari solari looked over at Cyrene then back at hipp... " I dont think so, but she did get a bit of a jolt earlier."<br>
hippolyte_sot: "Yeah I know," Hipp frowned. "but I couldn't have her thinking her daughter and granddaugther were dead."<br>
amznsolari: " I know. " She replied softly. " And trust me, as soon as I find mother, I will have her answer for what she did. Goddess or not."<br>
cyreneamphipolis: Taking hold of a bottle of port the older woman filled her mug and downed the small shot of it she'd poured. Stareing at the space infront of her, she clearly looked deep in thought.<br>
hippolyte_sot Hipps brown orbs glanced to Cyrene at the bar and sighed. She surely didn't want to offend the woman. She knew it had to be a lot to handle.. maybe Hippolyte should have let Cyrene find out for herself.<br>
amznsolari Solari looked at hipp, then to cyrene once more. " You did the right thing my friend, even if it dosent seem that way right now.<br>
hippolyte_sot nodded slowely. I figure if Athena hasn't come after Eve and Xena now.... surely Cyrene should be endaksi.<br>
cyreneamphipolis: Cyrene moved back around the bar and offered a reasuring pat in the Amazon's shoulder. She might not know what was being said, but she knew the look on the woman's face. Moving away to allow the two to talk in private. She found a place at the bar a few seats down.<br>
hippolyte_sot: "Cyrene.. do you need anything?" Hipp looked up questioningly from the table.<br>
amazonrhiannon: Rhiannon enters the tavern, and sees her athelfi. She sits down at thetable wit them and smiles. "What have I missed?"<br>
amznsolari waves at amazonrhiannon<br>
hippolyte_sot smiles at the energetic Rhiannon. "Well not much.. just some drinking and chatting. Have you met Rhiannon and Cyrene?<br>
amznsolari pokes hippolyte_sot in the chest<br>
hippolyte_sot pokes amznsolari in the chest<br>
amznsolari laughs at hippolyte_sot<br>
hippolyte_sot: "Endaksi, Solari."<br>
hippolyte_sot: "Well that and Solari seems a little intoxicated with her water." chuckled at Solari.<br>
amznsolari Solari just giggles at the playful jesture.<br>
cyreneamphipolis: Offers Rhiannon a polite smile. Glances to Hippolyte and shakes her head. "No, I should be fine. Though I might be leaving Amazon lands to seek out my family now that I know that they are alive."<br>
hippolyte_sot looks at Cyrene, "I know where they are."<br>
amazonrhiannon: Rhia shakes her head. "NO,I have not yet had the pleasure" She grins at them, ad waves backto Solari.<br>
cyreneamphipolis: Brows knit in concentration. "Where?"<br>
amznsolari flirts with hippolyte_sot<br>
hippolyte_sot: They are in another village. ::gently pushes Solari away ::<br>
hippolyte_sot: "I can take you there. Eve is on trial." Begins to think of taking water from Solari.<br>
amznsolari: ; chuckles softly.. " Sorry hipp.. : feels her cheeks redding a bit. <br>
cyreneamphipolis: Glances between the two, a slender brow disappearing into thick bangs. "The look," perhaps wasn't invented by her daughter.<br>
amznsolari looks to cyrene. " PLease forgive my manners. I dont know what came over me. "<br>
hippolyte_sot gets up from her seat. "I have to go back to my hut, but think on it Cyrene. If you want me to take you there.. you can see if it is your daughter for sure."<br>
hippolyte_sot: (( gonna have to hit the sack here soon.))<br>
cyreneamphipolis: "I will think about it. Thank you."<br>
amazonrhiannon: sits back quietly and listens to the conversation.<br>
hippolyte_sot pushes her chair underneath the table and looks to Solari and then Rhia, "Try and keep an eye on here. " chuckles.<br>
firesinger_99 joined the room<br>
firesinger_99: < Hello, all.><br>
hippolyte_sot: "Good night," Hipp walks to the front door of the tavern and then salutes all inside.<br>
hippolyte_sot: << nite nite >><br>
amznsolari: " Hey!" chuckles at hipp as she is leaveing<br>
amazonrhiannon: waves to hippolyte<br>
hippolyte_sot takes off thru the door and back to Themiscrya.<br>
