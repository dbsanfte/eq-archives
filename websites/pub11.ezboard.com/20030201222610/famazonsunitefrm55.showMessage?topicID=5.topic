<br>
Odessa rode in on her horse,Freya, her eyes looking about. She was looking over most of the Amazon Territory, hearing that a lot of the tribes had left to find new lands or had been killed by the last Amazon / Centuar war. But, when she came up on these lands, she could tell that the Amazons here were very much alive. To those scounting through the trees, she seemed like either a young Greek girl or an Amazon Trainee, not knowing much about how things worked. Odessa kept her eyes and ears open, listening for anything and watching for anything from an Amazon, or a leader of the tribe. <br>
Queen Chiara descended from the trees, in typical Amazon fashion, about two bodylengths in front of Odessa.  There was something Amazon in the girl's demeanor, which was why she'd been allowed as far onto her lands as she had been.<br>
The queen was clearly a warrior, well-muscled and carrying a well-used sword.<br>
&quot;I'm Queen Chiara... these are the lands of the Sisters of Honor.&quot;  As was her custom in situations like this, Chiara kept her tone light enough to avoid offense, but also managing to put across a warning that threatening her tribe would be unwise, and certainly bad for one's health.<br>
As Chiara jumped from the trees, Odessa's hands automatically went above her head, and clasped together as the sign of Peace for the Amazons.<br>
&quot;Yasoo, Vasilissa. I'm Odessa Loire, one of the Prigkipissa's of the Scynthian lands.&quot;<br>
She lowered her hands, saluting her. <br>
&quot;Ahh...&quot;  Chiara actually smiled, and gave a respectful nod.  &quot;All Amazons have heard of Scynthia.  Welcome to our lands, Odessa.  How... are you planning to stay long?&quot;  Now her tone was almost friendly.<br>
She grinned.<br>
&quot;I just came to see the lands, I've been scouting them recently to see the tribes, I've been wanting to learn about the tribes and how they did their ceremonies and their ways.&quot;<br>
She nodded again.<br>
&quot;That makes a lot of sense.&quot;  Chiara gave a distinct whistla, and her horse Eclipse emerged from the woods.  &quot;I'll show you the rest of the way to the village.&quot; <br>
She quickly mounted her horse, and settled into the saddle.  &quot;I've visited some of the other tribes myself recently... not Scynthia though.  Yet, at least.&quot;   <br>
She nodded, and clicked her tongue, Freya trotted up next to Chiara and Eclipse.<br>
&quot;Efharisto, Vasilissa.&quot;<br>
She smiled.<br>
&quot;Scynthia is really beautiful, but you have to be use to the frigid weather.&quot; <br>
The queen gives a mock shudder.  &quot;I prefer our weather here, efharisto...&quot; <br>
For lack of anything more to say, Chiara quiets.  The two Amazons ride toward the village.  The vegetation is lush, and the trees healthy.  It's all any Amazon could ask Gaea to grant her and her sisters.   <br>
Naiba is walking through the village, her head is down, as per usual, and she runs headlong into the new amazon. Her frail form falls to the ground.<br>
&quot;I am sorry!&quot; she says, not once looking up. She quickly rummages to get her things, making sure that none of the scrolls are dirty.<br>
Odessa blinked as she was bumped into, and she looked to Nabia.<br>
&quot;It's all right, really.&quot;<br>
She smiled, and held out her hand.<br>
&quot;Odessa.&quot; <br>
Naiba looks up, shocked as she takes the hand gently.<br>
&quot;Thank you&quot; she says quietly., looking at the ground. &quot;My name is Naiba Indrani.&quot;<br>
Consciously gentling her demeanor, Chiara introduces the new girl further to Naiba.  &quot;Odessa is from Scynthia, an Amazon land much farther north.  I think the two of you will have a lot to talk about, with one of you being a scholar and the other out to learn.&quot;<br>
Naiba looks up at Odessa quickly, smiling slightly, but retaining her frail demeanor.<br>
&quot;It depends on who you believe is learning my queen, for I am always doing so.&quot;<br>
Odessa nodded to Nabia, and smiled while listening to the two talk. She looked to Nabia.<br>
&quot;A scholar?&quot;<br>
She gave a smirk, she reminded her somewhat of Julian, he was always interesting in learning new things.<br>
&quot;You remind of someone I know, he's very intelligent...whether some people believe he is or not.&quot; <br>
Dori stepped out onto the high porch of her mother's hut, now hers and Zoe's.  She was barely covered,in only a brief cotton top and wrap around skirt, and wet from a recent bath.  Her long dark hair was combed and down around her shoulders and her lean muscles were glistening from the water.  Keen blue eyes scanned the village from her vantage point and she spotted Chiara and someone else coming in on horseback.  Tilting her head to the side, she watched as Naiba almost ran into them and was about to take off, until something Chiara said stopped her. Dori had to wonder about that girl, she was deathly shy, even around her fellow sisters. Perhaps Dori would have to talk more with the girl and try to make her feel more comfortable. <br>
Her attention went back to the other person with the Queen.  She wondered who the obvious Amazon was and where she was from.  Raising her hand she called a hello to Chiara.<br>
Chiara smirked a bit at Odessa, and motioned Doriana over. <br>
&quot;Odessa, this is Princess Doriana...&quot;  Then, as the dark haired princess is in earshot, Chiara continues.  &quot;She's soon to marry our younger healer, Zoe.  We're all looking forward to it because 10 years is way too long to just be making eyes at one another.&quot;   <br>
Dori made her way over to the Queen, Naiba and their guest.  Hearing the Queens comment about her and Zoe she gave her a glare, then tucked a strand of wet dark hair behind her ear and held out her arm to the guest for a warriors handshake, &quot;Welcome to our village and don't take anything our Queen says seriously.&quot;  She said with a smirk. <br>
Odessa saw the Princess, and saluted her.<br>
&quot;Yasoo, Prigkipissa.&quot;<br>
She bowed her head in respect.<br>
&quot;I'm Odessa Loire, one of the Prigkipissa of Scynthia; though I'm not the next in line to rule Scynthia.&quot;<br>
Which she didn't mind, she was Alysia's granddaughter and she knew it was customary for the daughters to take the Queen's place, though she knew her mother had stepped down form that tile, she was glad that her aunt Belle would take the position, seeing as her aunt Aliya would be the next oralce and Alexa...well...she didn't know too much about Alexa. <br>
Chiara nodded, not knowing the details of Odessa's situation but figuring she had older sisters or aunts who would inherit first. <br>
&quot;Well, we're glad to have you with us.&quot;   <br>
Naiba smiles to Dori and shrinks back slightly...<br>
Baily made her way out of her and Chiara's hut, wiping her hands on her leather pants as she stopped behind her and leaned her chin over Chiara's shoulder. &quot;Lunch is ready,&quot; she said quietly into her ear... and then noticed there was a newcomer among them, and straightened up. &quot;Pardon my interruption,&quot; she said rather sheepishly, a light blush coloring her cheeks. <br>
Chiara smiled back at Baily, and turned to settle an arm lightly at the blonde's waist in apparent unconcern at the interruption or revealing the nature of their relationship. <br>
&quot;And, Odessa, this is my partner Baily Wesston.  She's an excellent horse trainer and joined us from the tribe of Chadesia.&quot; <br>
Dori smirked at the actions of Chiara, seeing her affectionate with someone being something of a hot topic amoungst the warriors.  She nodded to Odessa, &quot;If you'd like a *real* tour of the village, you're more then welcome to join my warriors an I around the camp fire this evening, now I should get dressed before I scandalize the younger girls.&quot;   Dori said with a smug smile. Winking at Chiara she turned and trotted off toward her hut, long legs still glistening in the sun.<br>
he War Queen shoots an indulgent scowl after Dori.  Then, she turns her attention back to the others.<br>
&quot;Much as I hate to admit it, she's probably right.  They'd never admit it this way, but the warriors gossip like village women.  You can find out anything you want to know from them.&quot;   <br>
She nodded to Baily, and then grinned to Chiara and Dori. She knew how THAT was, girls at the academy always were talking about somebody, or the new people, especially the new guys. Odessa always listened, adding in her two cents worth.<br>
&quot;I may decide to join her myself.&quot;<br>
She grinned. <br>
Baily turned her head and laughed a bit, face shielded by Chiara's head. When she'd stopped her little laughing spell, she straightened up and twirled a lock of Chiara's hair around one finger. <br>
As Dori walked back toward her hut, she noticed a few of her sisters bumping into things suddenly.  Dori smirked to herself, knowing that she was certainly not an eyesore, and when she was hardly dressed, she knew she drew her sisters attention.  To damn bad there was only one little blonde's attention that she cared for.  She glanced toward her left and saw her best friends Lexi and Tristin walking by, she waved at them, giving them the most charming smile she could muster.  Both women spotted Dori and then walked into a nearby tree.  Dori burst out laughing and made her way up the steps to her hut, her laughing trailing behind her the whole way.<br>
Rhiannon had been cleaning out her hut when she heard a commotion outside. Taking a quick look out the window, she had been just in time to see Doriana wave to someone out of view, and to hear the sounds of someone walking into something...hard. She knew the sound well, having been a terrible klutz up until just before she had gotten married.<br>
Not being able to see who had gotten hurt, she looked back at the princess when she heard her laughter. Seeing the young woman fresh from her bath and hardly covering anything, Rhia could imagine what had caused the klutziness.<br>
The Princess entered her hut, and Rhiannon looked past her into the center of town. She could see Chiara and Baily together - at which she smiled- talking to another woman who Rhiannon had yet to meet.<br>
Curiosity getting the best of her, she brushed herself off and walked out to meet them.<br>
As she approached she noticed that she had not seen this woman in the village before. As she walked up she greeted Baily and Chiara, and cast an inquiring glance in the direction of the newcomer.  <br>
Odessa's attention was given to Rhiannon as she approached them. She gave her a smile, and nodded her head in respect.<br>
&quot;Yasoo.&quot; <br>
Rhiannon nodded to the stranger.<br>
&quot;Yasoo. Welcome to Marpesia. I&quot;m Queen Rhiannon. And your name is?&quot;<br>
Rhiannon was trying to be friendly and yet formal at the same time. She was still getting used to being Queen, and she was a bit awkward with her greeting.<br>
She held out her arm for the woman to shake. <br>

She laughs at Angie's antics, glad to see the girl so open and happy. It seemed like only yesterday she had found the girl asleep in the middle of the village, starving, and wild. Afraid to talk to, let alone trust, anyone. The grin stayed on her face as she looked once again to Odessa.  <p><center> <img src = "http://user.netomia.com/angelkim/rhia.png"><br>
