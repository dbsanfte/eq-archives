It was Alysia's wolf naturally, every amazon knew that.<br>
<br>
But what they didn't know was that as the Scynthian Queen made her way towards the village under the full moon, she was different.<br>
<br>
Alysia had been missing since the war and mysteriously appeared back in Scynthia a few days later. However, after a battle against the Priests of Poseidon, Alysia's headress was knocked off and there stood Gabrielle, Alysia's twin sister posing in her place.<br>
<br>
So where was Alysia? The Amazon Nation had pronounced her dead. But when the Priests of Poseidon and other enemies of Scynthia returned to take claim on the lands of Scynthia, there Alysia rose with bloodlust in her eyes. The word of the battle had spread across the lands faster than a plague. Alysia was alive. . . and kicking serious butt.<br>
<br>
She slowly walked into the village of Themiscrya, quiet and weary. She wore her usual short amazon leathers, but without her boots and weapons. <br>
<br>
In her eyes was a passion that had been lost long ago. But yet a curiousness within her soul. As if looking for answers. Belle had given her so many after she awoke in the Ancient Caves, but she needed more. And Belle said she could find some in Themiscrya, where Queen Hippolyte ruled.<br>
<br>
For she was no longer Alysia . . . but Samsara once again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenmaytha.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Queen Maytha</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#993300>(1/18/02 8:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=334.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re:</span><hr size=1> ((wow....thats cool....i miss aly already lol)) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualysiaofscynthia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alysia of Scynthia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 289<br> <font color=#993300>(1/21/02 12:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=334.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Wandering</span><hr size=1> Alysia glanced about through the vilalge.

All she wanted right now was someone, a key to her past as Alysia. She was told few things by Alysia's daughter, but she remembered nothing.<br>

She truly was Samsara.<br>

For recently, some came into the lands and attacked who they felt fit, even those of royal amazon blood. Artemis could feel the strength and power this amazon held within her.

Where would Hippolyte be? This was not a Northern Tribe and she knew nothing of the others. Where would a Queen be later in the night?<br>
<br>
Where would she be? In the forests.<br>
<br>
She turned on her bare heels and headed into the woods that surrounded the village. She glanced around and felt at home. It was like Scynthia actually, there in the woods. But something else was wrong. . . a noise was heard somewhere in the distance.<br>
<br>
She leapt on her heels and weaved in and out from the trees and bushes. A small deer was settling down to a patch of grass when Alysia came upon it. Alysia was a hunter, born and raised, but Samsara was more than that. She was a soul in nature. Daughter of Gaia.<br>
<br>
She approached the small animal and stroked the fur behind it's ears. Suddenly, the deer turned its eyes towards a dark space in the woods and then darted off into the opposite direction.<br>
<br>
Alysia's green orbs turned to another noise in the darkness. She knew who it was as well. She had been tracted from Scynthia by those who survived the last battle against her after her ressurection.<br>
<br>
After a small moment of silence, she leapt into the dark space and landed on one of them. As he wailed out to his companion, the other turned his head to face Alysia as her bare foot struck his jaw sending him to the ground.<br>
<br>
She looked to the one under her planted foot and placed her heel against his throat glaring down at him. The other again stood yelling aloud as an attack was being performed against the Amazon. He rose his sword and she grabbed it with her hand by the blade. It cut into her skin as she twisted it from his grasp and tossed it aside. Her eyes turned back to the one who now stood in fear and as he went to scream, her hand pushed against his nose breaking the bones in his face bringing death instantly.<br>
<br>
She then turned to look at the one still under her foot gasping for air. She leaned down and sat on his chest looking at him. He looked to his dead companion and then turned his eyes back to her. He pleaded for mercy as tears welled in his eyes. She blinked at the plead of mercy and glared down speaking to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I lost my knowledge of mercy long ago.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her hand pressed against his throat as he finally collapsed on the ground. She looked at his fallen hand and saw a dagger in it that had been dropped.<br>
<br>
&quot;For good reason I lost it too . . .  no man is to be trusted.&quot;<br>
<br>
She stood once more and scanned the area seeing that no one else was near. She felt an immortal pressence near, but ignored it knowing the Gods were all around.<br>
<br>
And now to find Hippolyte. . . <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ulionessofhera.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lioness of Hera</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#993300>(1/24/02 4:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=334.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/sing.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A noise in the Night</span><hr size=1> As Alysia stood in the clearing, she could hear her wolves had begun an obnoxious barking.  Then the sound of a lion roaring and huffing at them.  The sound grew nearer and soon she saw a golden lioness prowling out of the forests, the wolves on either side wary but no longer barking.  <br>
As the golden beast prowled up to Alysia there was a slow metamorphisis, til a woman appeared before her.  She almost looked like an amazon, yet the skins she wore were the fur of a cheetah.  She wore jewelry made of bones and fangs, and in one of her hands appeared a long spear.<br>
&quot;Come, this Hippolyte you seek is very busy.  I have been sent by Hera to bring you to her,&quot; Sin was very unceremonial in this meeting.  The familiar of the Queen of the Gods had never been one for talking.

She had never seen such magick in this world as of yet, she too had no idea that within her own blood was the ability to shift as well.<br>
<br>
She looked to the woman and down at the wolves who were now in bow of the woman. Alysia had taught them respect for Hera and her diciples. She slowly nodded and followed the woman.<br>
<br>
She turned her eyes to the woman's apparel and the bones of jewelry dressing her.<br>
<br>
&quot;You wear the marks of the Tretmolec. When we have killed an enemy, we add a bone.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled putting trust in the woman for this fact.<br>
<br>

And Hera is my goddess.  She is the Queen of the Gods," Sin turned her golden orbs to gaze at the wolves and then back to Alysia.  Soon, Sin brought Alysia to the steps of the village.  "You must remain quiet and I will bring you inside.  There is a trial.  And you are in need to join them.  I know you have been thru a new transformation and have forgotten many things.  That will help when you help to decide if this amazon is innocent."<br>
<br>
<br>
Sin entered with Alysia and lead her to her rightful seat.  As she came near Vasilissa Hippolyte she bowed in respect to the granddaughter of Hera.  Then quietly left, for she was not an amazon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right
