Kessara looked up, golden eyes sparkling. &quot;But it's fun, isn't it?&quot;<br>
Ayla refused to answer, but she knew that she would never had agreed to this venture if she hadn't been intrigued. &quot;So this is Themiscrya?&quot; she asked, to no one really. <br>
&quot;Yes,&quot;Kessara said. On this rare occassion, Kessara chose to shift into her human form. They stood in the middle of the villiage, shielding themselves from mortal eyes. An Amazon villiage. Intense light blue eyes focused on several women in the villiage. One was working in a forge. Others standing around visiting. Others practicing combat. The one who caught her attention walked past the openning of a stable to the horses within. &quot;Hippolyte,&quot; she remarked, her fascination caught. The granddaughter of Hera. Ayla had never met the Queen of the Gods, for reasons of her own. She realized sadly, that Kessara and Hermes were possible her only friends. Hermes, the messanger of the gods had always come to her when the gods had vengence in mind. Ayla, the once Assasin of the Gods, frowned.<br>
 Hippolyte walked out of the stable and walked toward a hut. Ayla was severely startled when the Amazon queen looked her directly in the eyes. &quot;Impossible,&quot; she whispered. No mortal could see a god unless wished so. Then she was reminded quickly. Hippolyte was not mortal. She was the daughter of a god. &quot;Aw hell,&quot; Ayla said. &quot;If she comes over here, you are going to explain this to her!&quot; Kessara smiled. <br>
    &quot;It's about time we introduced ourselves to the world don't you think?&quot; Kessara commented. Ayla stiffened. &quot;I don't want to do this.&quot;<br>
 &quot;Why not?&quot;<br>
Ayla remained silent. Blue eyes focused on Hippolyte and lost the angry look caused by Kessara. Well, it would be interesting. </font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#fbe5b4><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Amazon Queen</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>58</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#993300>3/7/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#993300>8:15:10 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=169.topic&index=1><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Reply</FONT></A></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Goddesses in Themiscrya</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial"> Dawn stood leaning against her hut, the cold bustling about her.

She turned in a slow circle, her blue eyes freezing to a silvery blue, almost white color.<br>
<br>
Kessara turned to her friend, a smile on her face, which faded immeadiately. This wasn't the Guardian Ayla, this was Ayla the Assassin. Cold, pale, calculating eyes searched the village in a chilling silence, then Ayla's circle stopped at a hut, where an impressive mortal woman -at least Kessara thought she was mortal- stood. Kessara couldn't tell if the woman could truly see them, but she was looking in their general direction. Ayla stared at her for several second, then her eyes turned back to their normal color. <br>
 <br>
Ayla blinked rapidly. She knew she had over-reacted, but it was a force of habit. The woman knew they were there, she knew that. But she didn't know if the woman welcomed them, or not. &quot;I think it is about time we left,&quot; she murmured. Kessara's gold eyes narrowed. <br>
<br>
&quot;Fine.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ayla turned to leave, gratefully, for she did not want to confront anyone. Unfortunately, the Fates never made life, even an immortal's life, that easy. Rheia, one of Ayla's four adopted half-god children appeared before them, in a flash of green. Rheia was the youngest of the four, at six years old, and by far the mischievous. Hazel-green eyes twinkled with pleasure. &quot;Mommy!&quot; She flung herself at Ayla's legs, Rheia's black hair wild. Her curiousity was brought full swing, as the young halg-god turned to the village. &quot;Wow, an amazon village! Kreon told me about these.&quot; <br>
<br>
Ayla frowned. She would have to talk to Kreon. Her second youngest adopted child, and only boy of the four, was constantly stirring trouble with his little &quot;sister,&quot; although he was only seven. Ayla can remember how his grey eyes turn smokey when he is guilty of some trouble. <br>
<br>
Ayla turned her attention back to Rheia, who, to Ayla's alarm and dismay, was racing toward the village, and directly into the path of the woman. With a sigh, she followed after her.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#fbe5b4><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://hometown.aol.com/queenhippolyte/spinningsword.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Vasilissa</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>258</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#993300>3/8/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#993300>6:54:05 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=169.topic&index=3><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Reply</FONT></A><BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/pleiade3/ehipp.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Goddesses in Themiscrya</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">:::Hippolyte glanced at the women who stood in the snow watching the Themiscryans.

<br>
Ayla nodded, and Kessara chased after the girl, hopeing to catch her before she reached the woman at the hut. <br>
<br>
Ayla gave Hippolyte a brilliant, geniuine smile. &quot;Hello...I mean Yasoo, your majesty,&quot;Ayla responded. She almost laughed at herself. She had never had many friends, or been around many people when she had been mortal, before she had known she was a goddess striped of her immortality as a child. She didn't know how to act when you wished to be kind. She only had Kessara for an example, and she couldn't treat Hippolyte like one of her children. &quot;Well, if you want the truth, my friend, Kessara and I, were curious about your village,&quot;she said.

She didn't know if that was the child's name then, but that was what she had told the woman. Though it didn't really matter, her breathe stopped, and she forced herself to pay attention to the queen, while her mind raced. The child, blessed long ago, by the goddess Assassin. By her. Ayla felt a sense of pride she tried to ignore. She couldn't have chosen better. The child had grown. She was strong. Dawnithina may even be as good -or even better- as Ayla had been. <br>

It had been so long since she had eaten mortal food. It was fabulous. &quot;Thank you Hippolyte,&quot; Ayla said, a brilliant smile on her face. Within seconds the fruit was reduced to a simple seed. Kessara followed Ayla example. Ayla paused. &quot;I am so sorry,&quot; she said, &quot;Are you hungry?&quot; She offered the queen a fruit, with a grin.  For the first time she was relaxed. She wished she had been this relaxed when Dawn was here, then maybe the amazon queen would not be angry with her. Hermes told her that mortal's feelings toward her and the gods shouldn't bother her, but she did not like being hated or feared. Which would explain her career change from an asassin to a guardian.
