He applauded the both of them a smirk on his face.  &quot;Ahh, this is such a blessed sight.&quot;  He innocently peaks into the walls of Themiscrya.  &quot;Is there trouble among the Amazons, my dears?&quot;  He turns his attentions back to them, his eyebrows raised questioningly.  &quot;Seems you have attacked one of your own.&quot;  Smiling, &quot;That's the kind of woman I like, kill first, ask questions later.  Oh wait, that would be Ares kind of woman.&quot;  He laughed, his voice echoing across the skies.  He was enjoying this scene and he'd enjoy it even more when Hippolyte and Hera were informed of it.  <br>
<br>
He sighed leaning against the walls of the amazon lands.  &quot;It is incredible to me how mortal women and mortal men are truly no different from each other except for the required anatomical variations.  You see, mortal man would have reacted much the same way as you have my dear dear amazon.

I am here because you have transgressed against your own, something I am certain Hera will not find amusing and as I prefer not to associate with her when she is shall we say upset over trivial things as this, I urge you to return to your athelfi and make whatever amends you must to ensure that this is rectified prior to Hera's knowledge.&quot;  His eyes narrowed at the amazon.  &quot;And if you so choose to continue on this path you have chosen, be forewarned, the gods and goddesses are watching.

The history between her and Ares was enough to make her slash five or six punching bags to shreads. <br>
<br>
 Before anything could be said, she walked into the village, leaving Sartha with the god.<br>
<br>
 Her boots dug into the ground as she walked to the centuar of town, and not knowing where the shapeshifter had gone to, she slammed an already wrote scroll onto a pole, held by a dagger.<br>
<br>
 The scroll was addressed to Vivan, and only to vivan. If and when she opened it, it would read: <br>
<br>
 &quot;I do not apologize for my action of fighting you as a centuar. For that action was deemed in the fact of my Amazon blood and things that have happened between the Amazons and the Centuars. What I do apologize for, is that I attacked an Amazon Intiate, and a shapeshifter. Our bond is even more, being that I am a shapeshifter. Please accept an apology from me, not that I am being told to, but because what I did to you was wrong. .  in the case that you are my athelfi. Please accept my apology. Signed Dawnthinia Rivent Darkshade.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn turned from the scroll and walked back through town, back to where Sartha and Zeus were. Standing back against the wall she looked to Sartha. The Amazon knew, that Sartha would see this as out of her character and almost weak in Dawn.<br>
<br>
 Her look didn't go to Zeus, she knew he knew what she was feeling and thinking.  <p>

She would cause a war with her actions were it not for the interventions of the most high.<br>

He'd watch her and her hate for the centaurs.  If she again attacked without justifiable cause, he'd render the judgement he held for her.

<br>
 That was the difference between the warriors and the assassins. <br>
<br>
 Dawn as early as a young child, was trained. Trained to kill, to kill in battle, to kill the in cold blood. Plainly to kill. AND if Daphinka would have been there when the Amazons fought the centuars she would know that Dawn had every right to attack a centuar, before it attack the Amazons.<br>
<br>
 Dawn stopped her stretching and brought her hands down to pop her neck, breaking the silence between her and Sartha.<br>
<br>
 Dawn had once thought about joining forces with Ares, she had, ALOT. And it had been convincing, but she wasn't that thirsty for chaos in the world, and she wasn't around for ranking. She was around to kill, and to protect the Amazon nation and her athelfi with in it.<br>

she rather liked the way this amazon killed it was refreahing to find one that would kill now and ask questions later..<br>
while walking behind dawn all that could be seen of her was her silver eyes and silver strapped sandels that went to her knees <p>*~`~*Hecate Goddess Sorcery, Silver-footed queen of the night*~`~*</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=daphnikearephiparthenia>Daphnike Arephi Parthenia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#993300>(8/8/01 11:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=261.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mrmagoo.fortunecity.com/royo/secret/secret03.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ::A centard filly clomps through the middle of the Villa</span><hr size=1> * Daphnike tries to understand Dawn.She remembers the long war with the Centaurs even if she was too young to participate to it.It was a terrible war...Daphnike don't like the Centaurs but she'll never kill with a cold heart without having to defend her life or the ones of her athelfi.She remembers those words Queen Hippolyte told her months before, that there's a time to make peace like there's a time to make war.The young Amazon admires her Queen's wisdom.Daphnike would also have good reasons to chose the path of the Assassin, her mother, Mytilene, was killed by a Roman when she was a child but life make her learn that vengeance isn't the way, to never fight with a dark heart.When short after her 16th birthday, Daphnike had been coldly shot by a bandit and past near death, she became vengeful but later learnt what is the price of vengeance, having herself being the innocent victim of a vengeful spirit who shot her only because she is an Amazon, to avenge a warlord who had been killed by an Amazon.Vengeance is a vicious circle Daphnike don't wanna be trapped into.She knows that Dawn's violence and harshness comes from a past suffering, but she'll never follow her ways* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=vivianquest>vivian quest</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#993300>(8/8/01 1:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=261.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> (sorry took so long just now realized it was a 2nd page now)</span><hr size=1> (sorry it took so long...had an extended blonde moment ^^; )<br>
