<br>
He nodded to Hecate, having proved himself a worthy opponent she would probably move on the find more lucrative a sparring partner. Quickly, to waste no time, Apollo dived back into the deepest recesses of the battle.<br>
<br>
Eventually Apollo had made it to the front lines, where he found Hypnos. He stood there before Hypnos, the air blowing his golden locks around, the battle still going on inback of him. It was as if all sound was drained from the fighting as Apollo spoke to Hypnos:<br>
<br>
&quot;It is a shame. That as &quot;divine characters&quot; we must lower ourselves to such things. Such primative ways of putting an argument to rest. But pride, the very thing that drives such a war, is one of the brain's most primitive functions. I hope that one day, soon , we can move on from this opprobrium, for that is what it is. It's disgraceful the way we act out here today.&quot;<br>
<br>
He paused, as if deciding how to make his next move.<br>
<br>
&quot;But a war is nothing without battles. And no battle goes unfought under such circumstances. So come on Hypnos&quot;<br>

A smirk rode across his face as he pulled his sword in front of him, his eyes glazing over with anticipation.<br>

He regained his focus only to see the god lunging towards him. His eyes immediately looked towards the three sharp heads of the Trident. A risky attack to take, but it seemed to spell the end of Alastor..<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He turned his body trying to avoid the attack, but as Poseidon continued to thrust forward he knew it would hit. The three piercing blades scraping across his chest the points ripping off links of chain mail as it passed. But while Poseidon passed drawing blood his arm shifted with his blade. His eyes locking with the elder god as he ran past by him, the immortals blood upon the trident. The sharp rune sword’s edge coming under Poseidon’s arms towards his unprotected abdomen while the god pasted with his weapon raised. It was a risky attack with much to gain and much to loose. It went from Check to Check Mate in Alastor’s favor.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alastor had no time to say anything witty or even react. It all happened in little less than a split second. <br>

 Her hand went silently to the blade at her thigh, pulling it slowly from the sheath, into the air. The black blade made no flicker no sight, no sound. Nothing could be detected of the assassins movements. The last known thing would have been her ascending to the tree.<br>

 Once focused and prepared, Dawn pulled back and launched the knife into the air. The blade rotated at a high velocity, aimed almost perfectly for Hecate's shoulder blade.<br>

Pain. Sharp. His eyes wandered to the arrow that found itself so neatly embedded within his flesh. Enough of these games. Apollo's golden aura began to glow. Now this aura would normally be useless, unless it was the aura of Apollo, whose aura was of the sun. As the golden light grew bigger and brighter the vines began to burn, slowly dying and turning into brittle, breakable twigs.<br>
<br>
Snap, crackle, pop. The twigs around him broke. He raised his arm and pulled the arrow from his shoulder, who by some mishap or another, hand'nt found its way all the way into his shoulder. Apollo lifted his arms, swinging it in circles several times to get his arm back in working order.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice move.&quot; Apollo smirked pulling his sword from its sheath. He placed his hand on the edge of the blade and ran his finger over it. His eyes lingered on the ghostly figure of Hecate. Suddenly Apollo lunged at Hecate with all his speed, lifting the sword over his shoulder. He quickly brought the sword down towards the shoulder of Hecate.<br>

As DeL helped Varia, Sartha tackled the Sleep God from behind, flipping to her feet once more as they tumbled to the ground, sword flashing, poised at the god before her. Those silvery-golden eyes flashed black for a moment, her stance that of waiting and ready. A small smirk crossed her lips. She didn't appreciate the feels Hypnos had towards her Athelfi. She released the growl she had been holding back and awaited the god to rise:: <p>~The old days are gone. You can't live in the past, and you can't wait for the future. Now is all we have.

Once out of anyone's sight, Dawn had lept back into the saddle of her horse. Yes..this horse was always there when Dawn needed it. And as soon as fogstone had passed by the amazon on her horse.. <br>
<br>
 The horse and rider came riding up behind him, with a pull of the reigns, the front legs of the horse were up, and came slamming back down toward the man's back. If the horse hit correctly, Fogstone's back would not only be broken, but he'd be paralyzed from the waist down. <br>
<br>
 Before the horse landed back to the ground, Dawn rolled backwards off the saddle, her hands dropping from the reigns. Once on the ground she held a sword in her right hand, and a dagger in her other. Feet were spaced evenly, into a good fighting stance, along side the horse, that was and had come down at fogstone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0
