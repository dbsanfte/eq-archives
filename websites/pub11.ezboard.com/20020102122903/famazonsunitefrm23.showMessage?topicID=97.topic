The cry of peacocks was heard and echoed on the ivory and marble walls.  Hera's icy blue eyes were narrowed as she glanced around the room.  The priestess kneeled quickly upon seeing her diety.  The cry of peacocks also called other priestess's from their halls and duties.  Bending down their heads at the appearance of the Queen of the Gods. <br>
Hera sighed deeply and twisted her wrist to move her palm upwards. "Rise," she ordered calmly to the one who kneeled before her.  Then she turned around swiftly, her shimmering dress moving in a fluid movement with the Queen's form.  Hera moved up the steps that lead to the ivory throne at the top.  The throne carved delicatly with peacocks and feathers.  Upon reaching the throne, Hera sat down elegantly.  Resting her palms upon the ends of the arms of the throne, her eyes again trailed around the room.  A lioness galloped out of one of the halls and quickly ran up the steps, then lay it's muscular form at the feet of Hera.  <br>
Two priestess's moved swiftly to either side and began to fan the Queen with large fans made of peacock feathers. The other priestesses watched their diety quietly.  <br>

She was dressed in leathers, decorated with talons and fangs.  In her hand appeared a long spear.  This was Sin.  Familiar, Messanger, and Assassin for the Queen of the Gods.  Sin was a shapeshifter.  A lioness woman whom Hera had released from the hands of a Sumerian God, who abused her as a cub.  Immortal and loyal, she was one of Hera's secret right hands.
