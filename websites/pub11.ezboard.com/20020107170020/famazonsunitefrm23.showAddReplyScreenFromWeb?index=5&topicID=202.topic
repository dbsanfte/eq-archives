The shadows lengthen and the city dies down. The fish tavern is finally empty. Poseidon sits back in the round stool behind the counter with his back to the wooden wall. Exhaustion has got to him from the long days work and from assuming this shape for so long. He rises and walks through the closed door without opening it. Sparks fly off the door from his passing and outside the tavern the night is warm with a nice cool breeze and the sky is clear and full of stars and the sickle moon. Over by the docks rustling can be heard from ship carpenters still at work and sailors laughing and getting drunk on their ships. Walking along the dock alone Poseidon walks into one of the ships. Rugged men are drinking and clouds of smoke from pipes float across the ship. He takes up with the men for the night and parties along with them waiting for the morning. <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uposeidonkofc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poseidonkofc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 261<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(12/18/01 5:09:13 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://web.uvic.ca/grs/bowman/myth/images/haifa/h89.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Samos</span><hr size=1> Dawn appeared bright and rosy-fingered. Laying sprawled on the floor were the drunken revelers and Poseidon. Some men were laying in their own vomit with lies buzzing about them. The sea god rose from his sleep as the rays of the sun touched his back. The ship reeked of filth and Poseidon walked off the ship with its boards creeking beneath his feet. His mortal guise melted away as he looked to the ocean and stretched. <br>
<br>
'One more trip.'<br>
<br>
The waves slapped the ship sterns and Poseidon vanished in silence. <br>
<br>
The island of Samos is quiet and a heavy rain beats down on it. The mortals who live here are still sleep and a few who want to get an early start to their day are already at work. Calling on his power he turns into a large seagull. His wings spread out at 4 feet and his yellow-orange beak is slightly curved downward. His feathers are pure white and his legs are scaly with sharp claws. He catches the wind from under him and lifts off into the air. The wind carries him toward the nearest town and to his final test. <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uposeidonkofc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poseidonkofc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 263<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(12/23/01 5:00:12 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://web.uvic.ca/grs/bowman/myth/images/haifa/h89.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Samos</span><hr size=1> The wind carries him quickly to the village. Over and above he sees that this village was much like the others and many devoted followers. The prayers from the temples reached his divine ears. The rain dripped off his feathers as soon as they were struck and remained dry. Poseidon circled around the town counter-clockwise 3 times and when he finished revolving he flew up straight into the air and burst through the grey clouds. Golden sparks showered the town and anything it touched was blessed. The clouds broke and the sun shone bright and strong. His descision was made and the people of Greece passed the test. The gods were still much in their hearts and given their due worship, at least the sea god was. <br>
<br>
On Olympus the empty throne of Poseidon became taken when the god himself appeared seated there. He looked exhausted yet pleased as if he had come about a great accomplishment.  He sat back in the throne and closed his eyes and though of nothing but keeping himself relaxed. A small golden table rolled up beside him with a cup of nectar. Poseidon took and drank of it immediately. He placed the golden goblet on the table and it quickly rolled away. Olympus was filled with commotion and the sound of movement about. Poseidon paid no mind and closed his eyes again. <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFF33>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#FFFF33> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23>The Olympian Gods</a> <font color=#FFFF33> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#FFFF33> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
