She herself was a Goddess by birth and blessings from Artemis, Velasca and Athena. But was not of direct Olympian order. Therefore she thought it proper and in great respect if she didn't just pop into the Main Throne Room in Olympus.<br>
<br>
She finally got through the gates at the bottom, having a few conflicts with the guards. She decided to transport herself to the top directly. <br>
<br>
In a mist of golden light and silver dust she appeared standing at the entrance of the Main Throne Room. She stood there with her head slightly bowed to the Gods in respect. She could care less about worshipping them, for her own ways as well as Eli's were in her head. However, she had great respect for them. Especially Hera, The Furies, Artemis, Athena and Dite. Figurably, the Goddesses instead of the men.<br>
<br>
She looked to them all and smiled seeing Hera. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yasoo Hera, it is good to see you are well. I hoped you had made it back from the war safely.&quot; Speaking about the Scynthian/Alt. Roman War.<br>
<br>
She took a step forward seeing that her pressence there was alright. She looked to the Gods and nodded her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;I come bringing news to share with my Goddesses. And in asking of a blessing. Eli, the Devi from India has asked my hand in marriage. I have consented to it.&quot; She smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;I and you all know that because Scynthia lies on Ancient Amazon Grounds, I do not need the blessings of Olympian Gods because of the ways that we follow. I myself am a Goddess of such order by your rites, and in equality of eachother, I ask a blessing from you on my marriage to the Avatar.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled to Hera. Then her eyes moved to Aphrodite.<br>
<br>
&quot;Especially from you Love Goddess. It is good to see you Aphrodite.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her eyes turned to Athena and Artemis in great respect.<br>
<br>
&quot;Because of my ties to the amazons, I ask for your blessings as well dear Goddess Sisters.&quot;<br>
<br>
She stood there awaiting the replies from the Gods. . . <br>

He pointed an accusing finger at Alysia.  &quot;This is no goddess.  She is not of Olympian blood.  She cares not about worshiping us as is proper. She wants only your blessings with nothing in return.  On Olympus, there is no such thing.  You give nothing, you get nothing.&quot;<br>
<br>
He continued his dissertation, &quot;By her own words she states..'I do not need the blessings of Olympian Gods because of the ways that we follow. I myself am a Goddess of such order by your rites, and in equality of eachother, I ask a blessing from you on my marriage to the Avatar.'  Be it known from this day forward, that no other false gods are equal to Olympians nor will they be blessed by Olympians.  Our blessings are to be given ONLY to those who live in accordance with Olympian law.&quot;<br>
<br>
His raging eyes then turn to Poseidon, &quot;Dear Brother or shall I now refer to you as Dear Sister, she asked not for your blessing, yet you offer it as if it is a prized gift to this individual.&quot;  He laughs heartily, &quot;And again I will give you her exact words. 'Because of my ties to the amazons, I ask for your blessings as well dear Goddess Sisters.'  Again let me reiterate, the Olympians are NOT your sisters.&quot;<br>
<br>
Again he faced Poseidon, &quot;Cling to your trident dear sister,&quot; his voice booming with sarcasm, &quot;I am the god of justice.  It is written that I am a fair god and a just god.  So therefore, yes, my ways are just and right.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zeus then glares at Alysia, &quot;You are not welcome here as the other gods and goddesses, you hold no title bestowed upon you by any Olympian; therefore, it is of little consequence to us.&quot;<br>
