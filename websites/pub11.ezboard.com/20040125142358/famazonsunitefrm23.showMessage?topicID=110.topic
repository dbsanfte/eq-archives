She lay the pleiade down upon a bundle of furs in the back of the cave.  A roar was heard behind her and Sin turned her eyes to see her friend, a male lion, enter the cave.  He gazed at the prone woman in the back of the cave with a sort of hunger, that Sin caught. <br>
"oh, no," she quickly replied. "This one is for Hera. You shall have to drag your own prey home." She laughed and gazed back out the entrance.  Sin knew Hera would sense and know that she had that which she was sent to hunt.  But, now was time to hide Maia.  Until Hera called.  <br>
The great male lion lay down near the entrance and Sin walked over to join him.  She lay back down to rest against him as the sun began to set.  It had been a long day carrying the pleiade to the cave of lions. <br>
She looked back at Maia.  Now she just had to wait for Hera.<br>

Hera's blue eyes turned from icy blue to peacock feathers and the cave trembled as she spoke. As if even the ground knew Hera's fury.

Pushing the lioness from his body chainmail dripping with the crimson liquid. As with a quick jerk pulled the sword from the lioness as the other one came to attack him. Trained to keep his head on his shoulders he pulled a rope with three rocks tied to it from his pouch. He throws it, the rope spiralling through the air.

Once we get her there, she will be safe.  Hera and her minions cannot touch the there.&quot; Then he glances to the priests and priestess.  &quot;We need to  borrow your clothes,&quot; Herc gets them to exchange clothes with Alastor and Maia.  This way their scent would change a bit, and the lioness would be shaken off.<br>
He turns around and looks towards the back and then to Maia and Alastor.  &quot;Let's go out the back,&quot; he leads them out the back of the temple and into the woods. All they had to do was get to Mount Cyllene, Herc knew that.  All all would be alright.<br>
He lead them on at a rather fast pace, knowing to stop would surely allow the lioness to catch up.  <br>
After traveling for most of the day, the reach the bottom of the line of mountains that Mount Cyllene lies in. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=alastorofancients>Alastor of Ancients</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(7/9/01 6:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=110.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://caspervandien.net/sleepyhollow/themovie/photos/images/indeximageov.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Escape</span><hr size=1> He tugs at the clothes when he walks missing his armor.

For she is now home and safe.  She looks to the two as they chat about the rescue.  Winking at Hercules as he speaks that anything can happen when it comes to the Gods.<br>
&quot;Yes, and you did happen Hercules,&quot; she said softly. As Alastor spoke of the lions, Maia glanced back.  She knew they might have lost the lions, but she also knew Hera would be waiting for her to leave Mount Cyllene.  Maia began to move a bit quicker up the mountain as she saw the entrance to her cave.  She ran up ahead of the two and entered thru morning glory vines that partially covered the entrance.<br>
As she entered one would be very surprised at what they saw.  For inside it would seem they had entered a marble temple with great columns.  She breathed a sigh of relief and walked over to a pile of pillows and animal skins, falling into them and sitting there. <br>
