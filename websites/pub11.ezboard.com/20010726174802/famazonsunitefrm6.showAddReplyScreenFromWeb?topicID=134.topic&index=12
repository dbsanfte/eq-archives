<br>
She had called a meeting of Scynthia for the sisters to introduce the new Princess of the tribe. She looked out to her athelfi and smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is so good to see so many sisters united together in one tribe. I come to you today to introduce a new sister to the tribe. Rumors have gone through Scynthia I have seen. Yes, this girl that stands before you is my adopted daughter, yes she was a mere initiate last week. However, because she is my daughter by Amazon Law, it makes her an Amazon Princess. And seeing that my other daughters have other responsibilities which I will not deny them, Belle shall take the official position in this tribe.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked out to see the other sisters whispering and talking amongst themselves.<br>
<br>
&quot;When I was given word to Cora's resignation from her position in the tribe, I was both worried and saddened by this news. Cora however did not fit the position. She has a place somewhere else, with her own growing family. I am glad she has chosen for her happiness. I adopted Belle not knowing that she would take this place in our tribe. She has both the rite and the will to do so. When I pass on, I will be happy knowing that this tribe and the future of Scynthia is in Belle's hands along with the help from many sisters as I have been.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smirked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't get me wrong. I am not dieing anytime soon.&quot; She let out a small laugh.<br>
&quot;I know this adjustment may not be easy for some. But it is what I have chosen to do. I trust Belle with the safety of the tribe. I ask now for you to bestow upon her your thoughts and blessings if possible. If you have none, then at least introduce yourself to her.&quot;<br>

 She gave a polite, but fake smile and looked back to Alysia.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Whose to say that she'll lead your tribe into a victory. Whose to say that Belle will be the one we should follow. We don't know her, and we don't anything.

&quot;Cora was raised in Rome. In fact, that is where she lives now. She was a wonderful princess. My daughter Aliya, was born in Rome. She is the Healer of this tribe. I myself lived in Rome and continue to go there to see my grandchildren.&quot;<br>
<br>
She stepped forward holding her head high.<br>
<br>
&quot;And who's to say she won't lead this tribe to Victory? We don't need to be lead Dawn. Our battle is over for now. She is my daughter, and riteful heir in this tribe. She has amazon blood. And has the spirit of a true leader. The Ancients have told me so.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked back to Belle and smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;We are blind to the future, we have two choices. One, to either question everyone and eliminate those we do not know or trust. Or two, we can teach those who do not know, learn from them as sisters do.&quot; <br>

Alysia believed that if the Amazons did not wish for another to enter the tribe, then they in turn did not want the Nation United. <br>
<br>
Belle's mother was an Amazon. Aly did not wish to turn her away. Though Belle was raised in Rome, she was not a Roman. She did not fight with Livia, nor did she join Rome's legions. . . . Aly had done that in her past. <br>
<br>
Belle's actions had always been for the greater good, and in becomming Alysia's daughter, it was her rite to hold the position of Princess.<br>
<br>
(OOC Note: For those of you who are against this new Character taking the position of Princess, let me tell you why this was done. Belle's MUN and I are good friends IRL, she also RPs Gabrielle, Alysia's sister. However, Gabrielle is Queen of another tribe. I am already 21 years old, I work part time and have three children as well as a husband. I never know when I am going to have to leave RP for IRL things. The only persson I can trust with the well being of AotNL is BelleMUN. She kindly asked me to help her with one of her new characters and their SL. I agreed. I feel she has been treated badly since her arrival into the tribe. Whether it be just in SL or not. I do not believe that questioning her is appropriate. Our former Princess Cora, left because of IRL things as well as SL. I agreed on her leaving. BelleMUN kindly took the position even though she too has a busy IRL. Whether those of you who are against this so much are doing it because of SL or not, please tone it down a bit. We are supposed to be Uniting the Amazons, not going against eachother. BTW, in this I am meaning no harshness against anyone in the tribe. I am merely stating an OOC opinion to let you all know what is going on OOC in this SL. Keep up the good Ezboard work!) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Queen</span><br>  Posts: 93<br> <font color=#993300>(5/23/01 3:19:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=134.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=AmazonWarMaskofDeath WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Amazons Unite</span><hr size=1> (OOC: If you want to know why Dawn is against it and why I find myself against IM Me.

&quot;I'm sure Alysia is fully confident in Belle's abilities. If she wasn't, this wouldn't be happening. So, for the time, accept the child and we'll see how well she serves the title 'Amazon.'&quot; <br>

&quot;Just as she has her reasons, I have mine. I'll trust my instinct more than I'll trust anything else. I know better than anyone, that the ancients like to play games. As does the magickal beings we rely on. I have the utmost respect for the ancients and the Gods, but they do play games. I'll leave my trust where it is. My reasons will stay how they are.&quot;<br>

Dawn nodded to herself, as she waited Sartha's reply. Satisfied with how she explained herself. <p>Pyschotic injustice

&quot;Yes, you are right, Athelfi, they play tricks. And I trust my own feelings more over than anything else. This coronation makes me uneasy, and so I shall not trust it fully with my heart until this feeling is proven different. And I leave you to your own instincts as well, for they usually serve us all best. But what I am asking, Athelfi, is that you merely show.. kindness, if only slightly. She is but a child. Only time will tell, and until then it is still our duty to treat her, at least, as a human being. Everyone at least deserves a kind word.&quot;<br>
<br>
::Her eyes were locked on the Coronation still. She thought she had said what she could. No, she did not trust this girl fully, but she found that it would turn out better the more kindness that was shown to the girl, no matter the feeling behind the eyes. And so she waited:: <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sartha>Sartha</A> at: 5/26/01 4:39:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Queen</span><br>  Posts: 96<br> <font color=#993300>(5/26/01 4:41:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=134.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=AmazonWarMaskofDeath WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yes mam</span><hr size=1>  Dawn growled almost at a low purr, but it was a growl you could tell it most obviously.

 Dawn's emeralds looked down to the coronation as if she were pointing.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Until I find out what makes me feel so unearthly towards her, I'll give nothing.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn looked toward the princess and closed her eyes, her voice floated into Belle's head. The words that followed would mark what everyone knew of Dawn.<br>
<br>
 ~Congratulations Princess Belle, you have a long road ahead of you. A long road of trying to gain my respect. Congratulations.~<br>
<br>
 Everyone knew the assassin was the hard one to befriend. But she was a good sister once you did. And the statement wasn't ment to insult the Princess. It was congratulating her and forwarning her of the things to come.<br>
