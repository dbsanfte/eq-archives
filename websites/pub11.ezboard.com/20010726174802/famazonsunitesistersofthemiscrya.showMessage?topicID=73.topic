There she hung, her eyes looking down below to the table, where the newest edition of the PHOEBE Roster lay, as well as a package wrapped in brown paper. One continous thought lay in Dawn's mind, the request to be Queen on the Amazons in PHOEBE. The position was open when Dawn applied and Phoebe had told it her the decision would be revealed in the next Roster. Yep, there it laid before Dawn. After a few moments, the hands that were clasped around the rafter let go, causing Dawn's body to drop through the air at a rapid pace. Gravity does work, you know. Her feet landed against the hard wood floor with a gentle thud, although it wasn't loud enough for a mouse to hear, Dawn knew she had made it. Her hands reached for the roster and read it. The decision was revealed, it caused Dawn to sigh of relief and smile of happiness. The next step was for Dawn to open the package, she knew what it was. Her mother even from the otherside, always managed to carry on traditions. Dawn never knew how or when she found this things out, and how the gifts were transported, but her mother always carried on Amazon tradition. Dawn carefully open the package, smiling broadly as she found her mother's mask in her hands. Only now it contained the signature Queen at the top, tiny tears rolled down Dawn's cheeks. Then mask was so bueatiful. It was in the shape of a tiger, the ears stuck out from the long orange and black feathers, sliver decorated the outline of the tiger, nose mouth, face everything. As the same on Dawn's mask, there were leather strips hanging, only on this the leather was braided inbetween tiger fur, sheered from a tiger killed by a villager by mistake. Dawn continued to cry as she turned the mask over, the inside inscripted 4 words. To my dear Dawnithinia.<br>

 &quot;I might be a Queen, but I'm still going to do the same things, days on end. Just like I am now. As for your son, Aly, that boy is really going to do something.
