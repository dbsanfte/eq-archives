&quot;Dear sister, blessings to you and your husband. May any who tries to harm such, be cursed with oblivion.&quot;<br>

&quot;I am above this sort of treatment brother. If anyone is the girl here it is you. Whinning about this and that. Let us gods have some space will you? You say it is written that you are fair, it is also written that Apollo is all- good. He didn't seem too good to me when he flayed Marsyas, though justly so. You make bad choices at times my brother and I'm not the only god to have noticed them. Calm yourself now my brother and heed my words who am your elder.&quot;<br>

He launched a lightning bolt at his brother.  &quot;You return  to your own realm and do not set foot on Olympus until such time as I see fit.

It was obvious Tisiphone was the one to bring her sisters back. She loved her family. . . as much as a Furie can love of course. She was the Goddess of Vengence but for some reason her heart held a place for each of them. <br>
<br>
She remembered how it felt to each of her sisters when their own siblings were put away for all time. And she missed them.<br>
<br>
She nudged Alecto and Megaera towards Zeus.<br>
<br>
Alecot sighed and looked to Hera seeing Zeus glare at his own wife. &quot;We would like to apologise for our harsh words Nephew. The well-being of Olympus is in our hands as much as anyone else.&quot;<br>
<br>
Megaera nodded and for the first time, she spoke without a smirk on her face. &quot;We respect your place as King of the Gods, but you must understand the position we hold. For we were born long before the Olympians and I suppose we are still holding grudges deep inside for the loss of our own family.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tisiphone smiled lightly and looked at Hera.<br>

There are other's who want to end our reigns...on Olympus, in the Seas, and in the Underworld,&quot; her eyes narrowed at them all.  &quot;We have enough enemies, without destorying each other ourselves.

King of the Gods.  Let's not step on those old paths right now.  Even Poseidon has recently felt someone's attempt on his life, just the other day.  So.. I say ENOUGH.  We have enough to take care of and worry about.&quot;  She moved slowely over to Zeus and gently put a hand upon his arm and smiled. &quot;I thank you dear for bringing your siblings back from our father's stomach.

Walking over to her and then hugging her gently.  Hera had always marveled and was a bit jealous (go figure) at Hestia's calmness and her virginity. Thinking to herself of being the youngest and possibly most power hungry of the three sisters.  Thusly, pron to problem making.  She stepped back and raised a brow at Zeus.  She knew he thought very much of Hestia as well..at least she troubled him less they the other Olympians.  And in her virginity..she was very akin to his favorite offspring...Athena. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showMessageRange?topicID=20.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showMessage?topicID=65.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showMessage?topicID=2.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.emailToFriend?topicID=20.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.threadControl?topicID=20.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/blueMoon/deleteThread.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=20.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=20.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm37">The Mythical Odyssey Forum<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitefrm32">The Mythical Odyssey<option value="amazonsunitefrm35">Amazon Nation Alliance<option value="amazonsunitefrm33">Character Descriptions<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm30">Amazons of the Sacred Circle<option value="amazonsunitefrm34">Amazons of Lesvos Island<option value="amazonsunitefrm38">High Mountain Tiger Clan<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm28">Amazon Sisters of Cremni<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm31">Amazon Language<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF33>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#FFFF33> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23>The Olympian Gods</a> <font color=#FFFF33> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#FFFF33> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
