No, we shall fight...with the strength that Hera has given us...and the strength we have earned..for ourselves!  Themiscyra and her forests and river...they belong to the amazons. :::Hipp salutes the amazons before her::: Arm yourselves, ready your horses!  I want homemakers and children guarded.  Those who have already been chosen to do so...I expect on you to act immediatly.  Village Warriors...gather together and protect the very city of the amazons.  Gather the weapons you need and ready.  The Village Warriors shall be lead by Dawnithinia.  Healers....prepare the healing hut.  And may Athena be with you.  :::she cocks a brow and gazes about:::Forest Guardians....you shall split into two groups.  The leaders shall be Sartha Ann Rose and I.  So ready your horses and weapons.  Listen to your leaders...watch your athelfi's back.  Protect our home, our families, and our way of life!  :::she salutes again::  To your post!  Amazons UNITE!  :::with that Hipp turns and walks into her hut, quickly with the help of two amazons, she is dressed in her armour.  Then she turns, grabs her mask and steps outside.

Hercules quietly stepped out of the forest and into the village.  The war had not reached the village yet.  But, amazons were preparing.  As he slowely carried the lifeless queen into her village.  Amazons began to surround him.  One Amazon stopped him and he looked to her sadly and worn from the emotions that ravaged in his heart.  He had once loved the woman in his arms.  A love he had to forget.  And now she was dead in his arms.  "She was struck and killed by a Centaur in the Northern Forests."<br>
