Raven and Xena pushed to keep the construction and now it was finally finished. The village on the banks of the river was a City now, surround by a large stone wall that opened on the shore of the Tanais. The gates were made of iron, and just above them sat the three moons representing the aspects of the Goddess. Under the Maiden, was a raven signifing the War Queen Raven. Under the Mother, a black cat which was Otere's totem animal. Under the Crone Moon, was a blue dragon. Yakut had sent Raven visions of the past Amazons of TRV and showed her that Dragon were the original totem of the Tanais River Valley Amazons.<br>
<br>
At the mouth of the Tanais River stood a regal figure holding the reins of Hannibal. She wore familiar baggy buck skin pants with a rope of talismans wrapping around her waist, but she had one new piece, her buck skin bra-like top. This top allowed her skin to reveal its many tatoos. On the left breast, the brand of the Shaman; On the right arm, &quot;Amazon Queen&quot; in Ancient lettering; On the shoulder blade was a snow leopard. Ahh, but now a new tatoo inked her body, her left arm had a large indigo dragon coiling up her arms from wrist to shoulder, a stream of fire the creature spat wrapped around the base of Yakut's neck. Yakut wore her stagg antler headdress but her long brown tresses were now streaked wih thick gray strands. The Queen was jaded, and little bit more wrinkled but she was still alive.<br>
<br>
She mounted her steed and rode into her city, green orbs gleamed with pride as they saw the progress of her people. Yakut flung her leg over and slid from the saddle. She let go of Hannibal's reins and walked to the large platform, a crowd of Amazons followed her there cheering and whispering.<br>
<br>
What had happened to their Queen? Only time would tell. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The Queen Shamaness looked at her tribal sisters and tears came from her eyes staining her cheeks.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm home sisters!&quot;, a roar of screaming and cheering rang throughout. Yakut let those tears flow, she was finally home! <p>-|-Queen Yakut-|-<br>

Suddenly, two hands thrusts two amazons, which were standing side-by-side, apart from each other.  And there stood a pot-bellied Otere.  Obviously, the shamaness was pregnant.<br>

The young girl wore a few less clothes than the usual Shamaness did. She wore a leather top that split down the middle reaching her hips. Her shoulders were in bare view as always, and on her right arm she bore the symbol of an Amazon Queen, and on her left, was a black feather. She wore an amazon mask however, unlike the usual leopard or dragon masks worn in the Valley, this one wore that of a bird. Black feathers adorning the top, and a beak like shape in the front of the face.<br>
<br>
The black horse came to a stop in front of the large area where the amazons had gathered.<br>
<br>
A younger amazon of the tribes saw the woman and then looked back to Yakut and shouted.<br>
&quot;All hail the Queens of Tanias Valley!&quot;<br>
The other amazons in unison repeated her with a shout.<br>
<br>
The woman removed her mask and looked forward to Otere and Yakut. A sword in it's sheath rested at her hips, and daggers were worn in her boots. Very unlike most Amazons of the valley. <br>
She grinned lightly as she looked to the two elder women, and then to the rest of the tribe.<br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome back Yakut, Queen of the Valley!&quot; She smiled towards Yakut. &quot;Welcome home Materas.&quot; <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">~*~ Jessica ~*~<br>

<br>
&quot;Oh by the Great Mother, Otere! I have missed you!&quot; Yakut lifted her head and through her tears she made out a figure of  a familiar person. When the Amazon approached, Yakut could have never been filled with more pride. She recognized this woman to be her daughter, the eldest, Raven.<br>
<br>
&quot;My Ravey! Oh dear kouri!&quot;, Yakut slid from Otere's embrace and approached Raven on her horse. She opened her arms with tears still flowing down her face, waiting for Raven to be wrapped in them.<br>

She rested a hand on her stomach, gently rubbing it in a circular fashion.  Her auborn occulars fell out of focus as she began to think of the times that were and the times that are to come.  A faint smile played her lips.<br>
<br>
As Otere stood behind Yakut and watched her receive the greeting she well desirved, Otere began to feel something in the air build up.  She moved her head to face the platform and brought her eyes back into focus.  Otere had realized what feeling that was building up, and it was excitement.<br>
<br>
She turned her body in the way she was looking and began to make her way to the platform.  When Otere came mid-stage she raised her arms highly towards the sky, in an attempt to call all Amazon's attention to her.  When she had most of their attention, she began to speak.<br>
<br>

She stayed out of the way as she watched the commotion surrounding Yakut, a small smile on her soft pink lips as she recognized the famed Shamaness-Queen. <br>
 She leaned back against a tree, her arms folded over her chest as she listened to snippits of conversation, then looked over at her mare, who was watching the women almost curiously. She smiled a bit, then looked back to the going's on.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3F3F3F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=amazonqueenyakut>Amazon Queen Yakut </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen Shamaness</span><br>  Posts: 302<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(4/11/03 10:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=88.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/magickalamzn/images/yakut1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Greetings...</span><hr size=1> Yakut sensed a newcomer not too far away, but the newcomer posed no threat and therfore the Shamaness merely shrugged away the feeling. Suddenly, her eyes were drawn to a overly familiar face. A smile displayed on her features as she still in tears stepped forward to greet her twin sister and nephew.<br>
<br>
The Amazon wrapped her quite opposite twin into a tight embrace, &quot;Oh by the Goddess, sister! I have missed you so!&quot; She slid from the embrace and smiled to Skylar.<br>
<br>
&quot;And how goes it my nephew?&quot;, she laughed caringly andgave him a kiss on the forehead. Yakut heard Otere's voice above the crowd and turned towards her as she spoke. When the other Amazons cheered, Yakut's face turned red from smiling too much, her cheeks began to ache but she didn't care! She had returned to her family, and home.<br>
<br>
During the celebration tonight, Yakut would reveal what al happened on her journey to Britannia...but that was for later now was the time to party! <p>-|-Queen Yakut-|-<br>

She spotted Auborn and a few others and ordered them to fetch the wyne and the food.  A group of younger amazons offered to set up the tables and music.<br>
<br>
After she had a few fellow athelfi organizing the celebration, Otere caught a glance of Raven and a light smile fell across her lips.  She stepped down from the platform and began to make her way towards Yakut's eldest daughter.  Upon approaching her, she caught a glimpse of a new comer, standing away from the group of athelfi, and couldn't resist but to pass a greetful smile towards the woman.  Perhaps later, she would ask Yakut who the woman is.  When she finally stepped to Raven, she lightly tapped her on her shoulder to get her attention.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Raven, would you have the honors of lighting the bonfire in the name of your Mother?&quot;  A great smile played her features as she looked at Raven, waiting for an answer. <p>_.·.Øtere, §hamaness of the N¤rth.·._<br>

On her forehead was a small symboled tattoo symbolizing the belief she now bore. For the Tanias Valley had drawn from the Ancients and into a new belief. . .a craft.<br>
<br>
She rose her hands in the air and chanted loudly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Blessed be the Maiden within me,<br>

Blessed be the Mother within me,<br>
for She bringeth love and life.<br>

<br>
She then looked to Yakut and Otere smiling a bit, and then her eyes turned back towards the empty space and as her hand was held outwards a ball of fire errupted from her palm and into the large bundle of wood that had been placed properly. The fire was then lit and burned rapidly before the amazons.<br>

She turned to her Mother and smiled.<br>
