Her mind had wandered, but she understood the concerns of her friend. She sighed once again and closed her eyes. There were far too many shattered pieces of her past to even attempt to explain it to Sheyala, nor did she have the will that day. Something seemed to be pulling at her life-force and draining it away. Her hands were trembling from simple tasks and she seemed to not hear it when others spoke, even her tigers and Veran. She looks down as the rose drops into her lap and picks it up gently, as if it might break from her touch. She stares at it for a moment, then gives a short laugh::<br>

&quot;Life is precious. One should not live for only one other person. They should live for themselves, or the world they live on.
