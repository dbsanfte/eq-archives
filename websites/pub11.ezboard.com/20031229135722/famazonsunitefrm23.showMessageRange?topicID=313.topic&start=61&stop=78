<br>
&quot;Exactly. Tisiphone can control the undead all she wants, they still will not enter Tartarus. It will be interesting to see however in regards to the dead...can Tisiphone's voice override a command from the Lord of the Dead, or vice versa.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As of now, we wait. They have not yet acted. Much like most Olympians, they simply speak about acting without actually doing so.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Can't you feel a slight increase in strength and awareness? The mortals are so petrified of the living dead that they have began sacrificing black sheep and black rams to us, to take this pox away and allow the dead to rest.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;My priests have already started spreading word that Lord Hades is not pleased. They seek to attempt to appease us. So we shall see if the Fates and the Furies and the gods of Olympus have pity on these mortals...for Lord Hades certainly has none.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hecategoddessofmagic>Hecate Goddess of Magic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(5/14/03 1:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=313.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://nefaria.com/gallery/1152x864/art/sorceress1152.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Cave of the Cylopes</span><hr size=1> Hecate stood outside the entrance of a huge cave when one of her messengers arrived.  Her ghost hounds roamed the earth doing her bidding, and she currently had them watching the other gods.  Hecate wanted to know if any of her fellow deities were making a move, whether against her or not.  <br>
<br>
The hound materialized from the thin mountainous air, and bowed before his mistress.  Hecate looked into her hound's mind and understood.  It appears that one of the Furies had left Tartarus and was roaming the world, most likely on some personal vendetta.  Hecate pondered this piece of information.  The Furies united could be a serious problem, but a single Fury would be manageable.  The Furies sought retribution for some sort of injustice they feel has been done to them or to someone they have a personal stake in.  Hecate knew she hadn't done anything directly against them, so she most likely was in the clear.  The guys on the other hand had decided to do things a bit differently.  Therefore most likely they were the ones being hunted.  Yet the Furies never did do things logically.  Their temperament was truly explosive, and anyone caught within the blast, in their eyes would be just as equally guilty.  Guilty by association.<br>
<br>
Hecate couldn't be troubled by that right now.  She sent her hound back to its task.  Right now she had something a bit more important.  She was about to enter this cave, which housed a major temple to the Cyclopes, Titans of the One Eye.  Although the Cyclopes should have been imprisoned in Tartarus, Hecate wasn't sure if they were one of the ones that had escaped.  Therefore there was a chance that she would be meeting them within this cave.<br>
<br>
As with the encouter with the Fates, whenever entering the domain of any of the deities, whether they were currently being worshipped or not, always gave them the upper hand.  In your own domain, you ruled.  Once you stepped out, the playing field became more balanced.  Well she was about to enter the Cyclopes domain, and according to her records, there were three of them.  Although the Cyclopes weren't gods, they did however have the power to rival them.  It had truly been difficult to finally defeat imprison the Titans.  So now, if she entered and all three were inside, she most likely would be able to leave only after a serious and painful battle had been fought.<br>
<br>
Hecate took in a deep breath, and let it out slowly.  Even gods get nervous before a fight.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hecategoddessofmagic>Hecate Goddess of Magic</A> at: 5/14/03 2:45:32 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thanatosofdeath@amazonsunite>Thanatos of Death</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.joerghuber.com/images/art_c48.jpeg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dark Death God</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(5/14/03 4:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=313.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Odds</span><hr size=1> &quot;Hmmm...

 <br>
&quot;So they think that freezing them up a little would fix things? But that doesn't stop new souls from popping out of bodies... The Fates may have a new job as the Greek deites clean up crew.&quot; <br>
 <br>
*Thanatos laughed softly to himself.* <br>
  <br>
&quot;Well one does not win by doing petty little moves... Excuse me Hades I will return momentarily...&quot; <br>
 <br>
*Thanatos disappeared into the shadows of the room, and reappears in some tunnel of the vastness of the underworld. He walked for a minute and then entered a room were souls were looming around, and doing some teadious tasks asigned to them... This was the entrance to where some of the worst evil souls had be sent to. The ones in front of Thanatos might have been mere thieve and vandals, but deeper inside the underworld is where they were imprisoned... <br>
 <br>
Powerful assassins, warriors, and warlord, doomed in pain for there horrible ways of slaugher and death... Mankind was not ment to do such horrible things, but Thanatos himself did not mind so much. There must have been about 50 souls in the room now, as Thanatos teased him telepathically to come closer... Then took a long exhale... And when he breathed in a horrid wind began to draw towards him. The wind grew stronger and stronger until the souls began to get sucked into Thanatos's whirling robes.  <br>
 <br>
In a minute the room was empty, and Thanatos was very recharged... His eyes glowed red once again, as he summoned one of the worst soul of the underworld... A assassin named Thaneus, named after Thanatos whos life had been dedicated to killing, floated towards Thanatos.* <br>
 <br>
&quot;Dear Thaneus... You were one of my most favorite. Trained in every art of killing... To my recolection you slaughter your own parents didn't you... It was a pity though when the King of Greece sent 200 of his most skilled fighters to kill you... oh how much more glory you could have given to the unstoppable power of death. But now, you are being given a second chance!!!&quot; <br>
 <br>
*Thanatos held out both of his hands and sent much of the power from the souls into him...* <br>
 <br>
&quot;Hmmm... Not enough I sence, to bring you to full potential...&quot; <br>
 <br>
*Thanatos's eyes glowed red again, as this time evil souls from all over that part of Tartarus were brought to the room as there energy was fed into Thaneus... Countless souls had poured into him before Thanatos stopped.* <br>
 <br>
&quot;I think I shall add one more thing to top it off...&quot; <br>
 <br>
*Thanatos raised both of his hands, as the 200 soldiers that were sent to kill Thaneus arose from ground.* <br>
 <br>
&quot;I give you the soldiers that you slaughtered, and that one special one that killed you...&quot; <br>
 <br>
*Thanatos eyed the one commander that have cleverly killed Thaneus, but kill himself in the process.* <br>
 <br>
&quot;Now GO! Go into the world of the living, and kill and destroy..... Split up into small groups to do your bidding, so that it will be a very big hassle to scream at all of you...   <br>
  <br>
Time to send in the specialists...&quot; <br>
 <br>
*Thanatos lifted his hands up as they rose through the ceiling and up to the world of the living, and there the split up and began to do there damage. Thaneus went solo, as he had always had, he had like to keep the pleasure of killing to himself. <br>
 <br>
Thanatos then walked back into the shadows and back into the room he was originally in, cracked his nuckles and sat down, starring early into the seeing pool.* <br>
 <br>
&quot;They under estimate the will of death...&quot; <br>

&quot;Have a seat Persephone, I shall explain all.&quot;<br>

&quot;Apparently, the Fates forget they need the rest of us in order for the world to function properly. They treat us as mere children, they have insulted me and have shown enormous disrespect to Thanatos; so I have decided to try to teach them a lesson. No dead soul shall enter Tartarus until further notice.&quot;<br>
<br>
::Hades then tilted his head slightly as he watched Tisiphone go to work. He found this very intriguing. He watched Tisiphone go from place to place and freeze the legions of undead, and then eventually return to the Temple::<br>
<br>
::Hades then pointed at the scrying pool and twitched his finger. All of the undead in one area started moving their arms. He then stopped and they went limp:: <br>
<br>
&quot;Fascinating. It seems Tisiphone's voice has become their default action. If I consciously command them, they listen to me, but I have to maintain focus or they go back to doing Tisiphone's command. Fascinating indeed...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No matter though, Tisiphone will have to continuously work in order to keep up with the amount of dead souls, even then she will eventually be overwhelmed and fall behind.&quot;<br>
<br>
::Hades then blinked for a moment when Thanatos disappeared. He knew exactly where he went, and which souls he allowed to leave the Underworld. Hades merely shook his head and smirked::<br>

&quot;Now they done pissed him off.&quot;<br>

The cave was enormous, and by all appearance, devoid of any human activity.  The goddess could sense the cave help animal and insect life aplenty, but also something else.  She paused, and scented the air.  Yes, there was definitely something different, but very faint, a trace of power somwhere deep within.<br>
<br>
Hecate walked deeper into the dark and dank cavern.  She could see without the aid of any light, and had no problem maneuvering within.  After some time, she felt she had reached her destiniation, even though she couldn't see anything as of yet.<br>
<br>
A huge boulder barred her way.  It wouldn't be a difficult task to move the stone.   Hecate was about to push the boulder away when she heard a voice behind her.<br>
<br>
::I wouldn't do that if I were you.<br>
<br>
Hecate recognized the voice even before she turned around.<br>
<br>
::Iris, what are you doing here?  I know for a fact you hate enclosed areas.  Have you come here to ruin my plans?<br>
<br>
This was said in jest, because Hecate and Iris were long time friends.  But the fact that Iris was here was strange.  Her fellow goddess would never willingly come into a place so devoid of space, or light.  The rainbow goddess rarely even visited Hecate in her realm.<br>
<br>
Before Iris could speak, Hecate sensed other presences near by.  She caught a distinctive whiff, and knew who the second entity was before he showed up.  A gentle ruffling of her hair indicacted the presence of yet another.<br>
<br>
Putting her hands on her hips, Hecate called out in mock anger.<br>
<br>
::Alright, show yourself.  <br>
<br>
With an infectious laughter, Pan stepped out from behind a stalagmite.  Waving at the two women, he bounded over to join them.  A gentle whirling near by began to quicken, followed by tiny bolts of lightning and thunder.  The noise frightened the multitude of bats that lived in the cave, and they fled in a screeching horde.<br>
<br>
::Stop your dramatics Aeolus, I know it's you.  Now show yourself.<br>
<br>
A handsome man suddenly appeared, wearing a toga that covered very little of his adonis-like form.  With a charming smile, Aeolus bowed before Hecate.<br>
<br>
::Alright people, now tell me why you all have been following me since I came in.  What are you three up to anyways?<br>

Was it really that bad that Hecate, Thanatos and Hades had to act in such a manner. Okay, Thanatos and Hades got there feelings hurt, and being males, they are subject to act like petty 12 year olds. Hecate didnt want to die, but hey, who did. There were some of them who accepted change. Change happened everywhere. Apollo's soothsayers allready informed her of there fate a long long time ago, but also that they would all be remembered in some way shape or form. Artemis figured she would rather be worshipped by a handfull of people then by none at all. She also did not understand why Hecate was going around killing off any woshippers of the titans, or there Priests and Priestesses, what would that accomplish? Nothing. Artemis was sure Hecate would flip if one of her Priestesses where killed for no other reason then a Gods petty injustice. As for Hades and Thanatos, blocking the souls from going to tartarus, what did that accomplish? The Fates didnt care if souls did not reach there destination. it was not there job. She understood why Eris, Ares and the Furies joined in...but this whole thing was pointless and stupid. Even Zeus himself would not get involved because even if the Titans escaped, they had no more power of the relm, and they would never get this power. She sighed and stood up, in a flash of green she vanished and reappeared in the temple of the Fates.<br>

The Furies were in on it for their job. Thantos and Hades were doing wrongs against Mortals in hatred of the Fates. Not to mention bringing back people that the Furies had since long ago tormented. <br>
<br>
Alecto looked up as she saw Eris and Tis return.<br>
&quot;Well done.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then looked to Artemis and smiled bowing her head lightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Artemis, you may have more than one word with us.&quot; She grinned lightly. The Furies chose certain Gods to have respect for. Most of the male Gods were merely toys to them, as they were to the male Gods. Ares was a special chosen of Alecto. Eris was honored because of her deeds as well as her Mother Hera, Athena was Zeus' chosen daughter, and Artemis was as high up there with the rest of them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=persephoneqofu>PersephoneQofU</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 216<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(5/20/03 12:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=313.topic&index=73>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Oh well</span><hr size=1> ::Persephone looks into the scrying pool, listening to Hades explain while nodding every once in a while::<br>

&quot;This much is true sisters, Hecate has shown great injustice to the Priestes and Priestesses of the Titans.

<br>
::Dear Hecate, you tread on dangerous roads.  Do you know how many gods are upset with what you have done?  We three understand your fear in the uprising of the Titans, and also understand that something had to be done.  But the other gods do not see things as clearly as we do.  Even now, many of them plot against you.<br>
<br>
Hecate looked at the faces of her friends, and knew that what Iris said to be true.  She looked gloominly upon the floor, her shoulders slumping with fatigue.<br>
<br>
::I thank you for your warning.  I knew from the beginning that what I am doing may not be easy, but I did not know there would be so many opposition.  The Titans were never gods, they never worked towards building up their worshippers like the Olympians did.  All the Titans cared for was pleasing themselves, and terrorizing the mortals.  It was we Olympians that brought order into this world.  What I am doing is preventing the chaos that reigned in the past from coming again.  Surely even the most near-sighted Olympian must be able to see this.<br>
<br>
She looked at Iris, her dearest friend, and Iris came over and hugged her.<br>
<br>
::The priests and priestesses of the Titans were never following a god, they were following monsters. In fact the Titans are nothing more than the monsters which we gods occassionally slay.  The One-Eyed Cyclopes, Hecatonchires evil monsters with fifty heads and one-hundred arms each, and many others beyond count have roamed the earth, and we fought them, beat them, and imprisoned them.  Now they may be coming back.  Remember even our most holy father, Zeus, led the fight against them, and we all stood by him.  Zeus charged us with defending the world against these creatures, and that is what I am doing.  It seems many of our siblings have forgotten their duty, or is it that they have  decided to forsake their king?  But this fight has taken a toll on me and my priestesses.  I can't do this on my own anymore.  The fact that you three are here to tell me of this, must mean that you are on my side, right?<br>
<br>
The three looked at each other, and slowly nodded.  It appears that they weren't too happy about having to choose sides.<br>
<br>
::Thank you, I know how hard this must be on you all.  But I think my task now is to seek others as well.  Therefore I ask you three to return to your duties, and take no action yet.  Please be there for me when I seek your aid.  And I will see to things here.<br>
<br>
Hecate gave each of her friends a strong hug.  Without another word, the four of them blinked out, heading towards appointed roles. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left
