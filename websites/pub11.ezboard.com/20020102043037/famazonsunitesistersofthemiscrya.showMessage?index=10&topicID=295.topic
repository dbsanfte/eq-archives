I too am a healer...call me the Princess of many tasks ~ laughs at her corny lame joke ~<br>
I can stitch you up, but am going to have to cleanse the wound, and that might sting a bit. Just dont need a wound like that to become infected.<br>
<br>
~She brought a clear bottle of liquid from the box nd a clean cloth she placed them both down on the table, then she took out a box of matches, lit the wick, a long needle and thread.~<br>
<br>
The liquid will sterilize the wound, it's pretty deep and has alot of choise area for germs living condtions..But it hurts..alot...<br>
~she looked from the wound, to Cricket~ It's up to you.<br>

She left it there momentarily, then took it away, yellowish seepage began to fall from the opening. DeL looked up to Cricket.~<br>
<br>
Wow, I'm glad I did that when I did. All of that that's comming out are germs..<br>
~she began to wipe it up with a dry cloth. When done with that, DeL picked up the needle and held it in the fire for a fewmoments to kill any germs that might be on it, then she threaded it and lookd up to Cricket.~<br>

I'll have you fixed in a moment.<br>

Pain is only weakness leaving the body. Soe warlord taught me that long, long ago...before I slaughtered his family and him. ~ she bandaged up the wound with a clean cloth and tied it around her tightly. Then she handed Cricket a bundle of the cloth.~ Make sure you clean the bandage every day, also, make sre you clean the wound. If it starts to turn red and a bad smell comes from it, look for me. I'll hve to reclean it. It will mean that it got infected anyway.<br>
