The water rises to a massive height and now looks to be a tornado made of water. Slowing down the water calms and takes the physical attributes of a god with long hair and a crown of water. If you saw him he would look like a giant man made of blue-green water holding a trident made of gold that is proportional to his size and girth. Many birds of the sea hoot and scream overhead and the underwater creatures rise to meet their lord and master.  The god looks over the waters and to the far off shore lands ahead. His son has done well in keeping the order of the seas. Now he must catch up on the affairs of the gods. His massive form falls back and than explodes splashing water for miles as he hits the waters surface. In an instant he is before his palace doors in his normal form quite bereft of clothing. He knocks loudly on his 2 large bronze doors and immediatly his chief servant's head peeps through and then quickly opens the doors wide.::<br>
