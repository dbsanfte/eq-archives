The Amazon dismounted her beast and gave the Amazon peace sign. She left her horse outside the gates so he could galavant and ramble.<br>
<br>
Ardyn was given passage, and she entered the gates and began moving deeper into the Village.<br>
<br>
Ardyn was clad in a faded brown battle skirt, and a matching halter top, dark brown boots had a pair of sais tucked in them. In one of Ardyn's hands was a spear, one of great durability and decored in the Amazon tradition.<br>
<br>
Ardyn had been raised in this Valley under Yakut's rule and was trained by her mother, Faith and her mentor, Yakut. She had to visit this place now that she had grown into an adult.<br>

She had short blonde hair and unlike the other amazons of the valley, she wore a warriors outfit.<br>
<br>
On her wrists she wore black gauntlets, very untraditional of her tribe. And partially on the skin you could see marks of some form.<br>
<br>
She looked to Ardyn and smiled brightly. A smile that could be reconized by anyone in the Nation. The smile of peace and wisdom. This was Yakut's eldest daughter, Raven. Queen of Tanias River Valley.<br>
<br>
Raven smiled to Ardyn. She was told that when they were little children, their Mother's used to let them play together. Raven didn't remember having any friends through her entire life, so Ardyn was the only recorded one in history.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's been a long time athelfi.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled brightly and then looked to Ardyn's stomach.<br>
&quot;Word reaches me that Atmah chose you to bear the soul of Chi'ah.

The resemblence between Yakut and Raven was very deffinate. Ardyn saluted Raven and she extended her forearm in all respect.<br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed it has. How's it feel to be Amazon Queen of Tanais River Valley?&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked down at her stomach when Raven gave her congrats and nodded with a smile as her green orbs returned to Raven.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I was chosen to be the vessel from which Chi'ah returns. Came to me as quite a shock. Thank you for your congrats.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ardyn had remembered some about Raven from their younger years but not much. Mostly it was from scrolls her mother had written of Yakut and Raven.<br>
<br>
&quot;Our mother were friends and when your mother died my two mothers ruled until Yakut came back. Now, you are queen and I am a queen. Perhaps fate is a bit ironic.&quot; <p>~Ardyn O'the Wind~<BR> =¤= Amazon Goddess of Virtue =¤=<BR>*Amazon Warrior Shamaness*<BR> "My friends,...they have faith in you.

<br>
&quot;Fate, perhaps.&quot; She thought a moment and then looked back to the village.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ruling is a bit interesting. I was raised in a dark art and warrior skill and now I rule a land which speaks nothing but peace.&quot;<br>
<br>
She gave a light laugh.<br>
<br>
&quot;I only do what my Mother would wish me to do as Queen.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled to Ardyn. It was nice having a familiar spirit near. Truly Ardyn would bring a joy to the village, as well as her new child. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uardynothewind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ardyn O The Wind</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(7/22/02 4:50:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/amznpardyn/images/jm3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Queens</span><hr size=1> Ardyn smiled listening to Raven. They had simalrities that created a friendship. Both of them Daughters of Great Amazon Queens, both of them different from their Mothers, Both of them with a Great Destiny ahead of them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your mother would be proud.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked at her spear and sais and smirked.<br>
<br>
&quot;I suppose, I should get rid of my weapons since your tribe is one of Peace. and not to mention simplicity.&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly, her spear turned to ashes and her sais disappeared. She was one of those Northern Amazons who seeked the old ways. She was rooted in the Northern Amazon unity and history. She had tendancy to be more traditional than her mother, Tyger. <br>
<br>
But Ardyn respected Yakut and raven's wishes because they were Amazons who would be proudly written down in history as great assets to the Amazon Nation. <p>~Ardyn O'the Wind~<BR> =¤= Amazon Goddess of Virtue =¤=<BR>*Amazon Warrior Shamaness*<BR> "My friends,...they have faith in you.

Two amazons stood outside wearing their hair down and in braids along the sides. Tattoos adorned their bodies, and their leathers, unlike the other amazons of the valley, were very short.<br>
<br>
&quot;Scynthians.&quot; She smiled. &quot;Queen Alysia gives us protection from enemies. Weapons are usually stored in that hut.&quot;<br>
<br>
She sighed lightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sometimes I go in there and admire the workmanship of every blade in sight. The enemies that have perished in the name of all that we worship and believe.&quot; A grin came across her face. She looked up to Ardyn and laughed lightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let me guess, not something you thought you'd hear from Yakut's daughter hmm?&quot;<br>
<br>
She turned and began walking through the village.<br>
<br>
&quot;I uphold my mother's wishes, and I only bring peace within the valley. However, I still long for the fight.&quot; She smirked. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamazonqueenardyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amazon Queen Ardyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(7/26/02 10:50:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/amznpardyn/images/jm3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Battle</span><hr size=1> Ardyn smirked.<br>

&quot;Yes, unusual for the daughter of a Peace-maker to want Battle..I share the same view. I have started my own tribe and have claimed the Eurasian Steppes. My tribe will wage war when it comes. I am not as peaceful as Yakut and my mother.&quot;<br>

&quot;I've only had Yakut as a mother. Apparently I was a blessing to her without the touch of a man. I only have on creator . . .  except for  . . . well . . .&quot;<br>

She thought momentarilly of Dakor. She hated him with a dire passion, but he would always be apart of her. She was mortal without his blessing . . . and curses to her blood. Perhaps that was why she allowed him to live since their last encounter.<br>
