The summer heat, was gone. The weather was that of the beginning of fall. The air was crisp and cool..but not cold, and if standing in the direct sunlight, one would actually start to sweat. It was the weather DeL loved the most. Though she was also very fond of the Winter and the snow.~<br>
<br>
~ DeL walked out of her hut wearing a light knit black sweater that she had knitted in her spare time, yes, she too had domestic skills...and a pair of black dyed calf leather pants with her boots, her hair pulled back into a ponytail. The weather made everything seem fresh and new. She took a deep breath and headed to a large tree that sat between her hut and Hippolyte's hut.~<br>
<br>
~She smiled and waved to the guards thats tood by the Queen's hut, then sat down beneath the tree..Soon its leaves would turn into its striking colors.~<br>
<br>
~She leaned her head back to rest against the tree as she picked up a fallen leaf, she held it by its stem and twirled it between her fingers as she sung softly an old amazon song thanking Gaia and all her children.~<br>
<br>
~As she sat there singing, some of the village children joined her and listened, she taught them the songs slowly as she once learned it herself.~ <p>         ~~* DeL *~~

She had packed up everything she would need for her journey.  What journey? She didn't bother to tell anyone, but she would be gone for some time.  When would she return to the Nation? She didn't know, but something out in the sky was sending these vibrations to her and she felt it was important.  It was another quest for her that the vibrations urged her to take.<br>
<br>
She had finished packing and had exited her hut into the clean outdoors of the village.  Shimmering brown eyes were now a serious, dull grey.  What of this change?<br>
<br>
She took a look around Themiscrya, inhaling most deeply and remembering every little sound, every little detail.<br>
<br>
And so she set off, in search of what was calling her.  Her hut had magically taken on the appearance of old and unused with a dressing of cobweb and pieces of broken, splintered wood about it, though she performed no such magic to it. She exited the village of Themiscrya and entered the world of continuous roads and crossroads...<br>

The leaves were beginning to colour themselves,it was the beginning of Fall and a good time for hunting as well as the time to make the reserves of vegetables in preparation of winter, to pick up medicinal plants.Daphnike was remembering how the last winter had been harsh and how she suffered of it as well as her athelfi.<br>
<br>
Like a bee, she picks up all the medicinal plants her mother, the healer Cyrena needs and leaves of kharissa, a flower looking like camellias that were growing wild in bushes  in the Thermodontine region, to make an herbal tea , the chais.Chais was well appreciated by the Amazons during the cold days of winter.And it'll soon be the time to make the vegetable reserves for winter.<br>
<br>
As the reserves of venison are slowing down, she goes hunting and returns with a deer after making her thanks to Artemis and her respects for the deer's soul and at the village, begins to cut the meat and keep the skin for clothes.Every part of the deer was used by the Amazons for their survival.<br>
<br>
After her duties ended, she goes in the forest to relax a bit.<br>

<br>
~She knew where the ribbon came from, but she hardly cared, she wouldnt think of it as a gift ro anything else, since Hecate tried to ruin one Amazon tribe. DeL respected all the Olympian Gods, she was after all Greek, however, she didnt pray to all of them. Mainly only to Hera, Artemis, Apollo, Athena, Ares and of course, Zeus. Those were the main dieties of most of the Greek Amazons....But she would never pray to any god or goddess who tried to harm another amazon or village for that matter....so..she kept singing, loud and boisterous, meaning each word that came out of her mouth. Her small family of wolves padded out from the forest around her and sat besides her, the smaller wolf pup sitting in her lap, she stroked its fur...and sang...~<br>

<br>
&quot;Mother&quot;, says Daphnike, believing that she was face to face with Mytilene's apparition.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sister, my nuamaz, is it you? Daphnike...You remember me my nuamaz, I was separed of since so many years.She was  8 years old when the Romans attacked my city of Themiscrya, killed my mother and sent me into captivity.I don't know what  her fate had been.She would have about your age now.You remember me Daphnike so much.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Mirina!You're alive!&quot;the young woman eyes fills with tears of joy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Daphnike! It's impossible!I'm so happy.We have so much things to say to each other&quot;<br>

Took captive by the Romans more than 8 years ago, Mirina Artemisia Kybele, Daphnike's older sister now lives in the Greek city of Trabzon, in Eastern Anatolia, where she's married to a Greek general from who she had a daughter, Thalestris, who's now 4 years old and a 1 1/2 year son, Aldericos. <br>
<br>
