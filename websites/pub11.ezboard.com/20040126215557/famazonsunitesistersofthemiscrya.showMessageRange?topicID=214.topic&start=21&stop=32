Then, suddenly, she lowered that bow again. She stood and set the bow beside her on the ground, then walked out from behind the brush to face the stag. It was strange, but that was Sar for you.

She had even been able to watch her sisters make their kills. As she sat high on a branch looking downward, she saw Hippolyte kill the bear. <br>
<br>
She had almost even reached a mountained area surrounding the forest. No animal seemed worthy enough for her. She sighed knowing the hunt would soon be over. <br>
<br>
As she flipped down from the trees, she looked at a group of small deer. She sighed as she reached behind her and loaded her crossbow. This was going to be too easy. . . and that she did not enjoy.<br>
<br>
But then she heard a small growl behind the deer in the hidden bushes. She knew the growl was not of immortal passing, so it could not be Dawn or Frost. <br>
<br>
As she set her crossbow down, she looked at the group of deer seeing that they didn't even know what was comming. Apparently both Aly and another were tracking the forest.<br>
<br>
Alysia got down on her hands and knees and crept closer to the opening of the forest where the small mamals ate.<br>
<br>
In a small moment, alot happened at once. A large Mountain Lion leaped from the bushes at the small animals. He already had blood over his mouth, it was clear this hunt was for mere fun.<br>
<br>
Alysia lunged at the lion, pushing it down against the ground watching the deer run off.<br>
<br>
&quot;A feline, usual enemie of the wolf.&quot;<br>
<br>
She grinned seeing this hunt a good one for the taking. It struggled a bit until she held it by the throat cutting off the blood circulation paralyzing it. Even though it was a wild beast, she did not want it to feel the pain of death.<br>
<br>
As it's eyes slowly softened, she reached in her boots and pulled out her dagger slamming it into the lion<br>

She now strode across the field, emeralds had changed to a blood red, and canines had grown into her mouth, claws drawn from her knuckles. She could shift fully into the form if she had wished, but she hadn't. Thus she controlled the bits of the tiger that she wanted. Dawn kneeled down next to the elk, her hand resting around the arrow soaking up the blood. Dawn closed her eyes taking a deep breath, as she snapped the arrow in the half. <br>
<br>
 &lt;ws&gt; &quot;Thank you Artemis. For all you have done for us, and all you go through. You are really the protector of the Amazons.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Just as Dawn opened her eyes night was cast over the valley a full moon over head. The Amazon Assassin stood building a fire by the elk, the warmth was not its use, as you would soon notice from the two stakes, and the bar that was put up over the fire. <br>
<br>
 She kneeled and skinned the elk, deheading him, and setting the head under a pelt. Atleast he wouldn't have to watch himself be cooked and then eaten. She shoved the elk onto the stake and settled back away from the fire, working with the pelt; cleaning it and cutting it making it useable.<br>
<br>
 Once she was done she turned looking at the elk, standing on her feet a claw sliced a bit of meat that was cooked for a hind quarter. Holding it in her palm she blew abit of her breath onto it, emeralds looking up toward Olympus as she held it upward.<br>
<br>
 &quot;This is for you Artemis. In honour of you. In honour of what you do. Who you are, and everything you have done for your followers.&quot;<br>

 She took the meat and placed it in her mouth, chewing and then swollowing. <p>Pyschotic injustice

She stands very still, slowly moving her head to look. In the brush is a large lynx. It is crouched down facing to the side, its eyes focused on a mottled brown rabbit. Its coat is greyish-brown and it has very long black tufts on its ears. She realizes that this is her animal. Moving very slowly with no sudden movements, Ilokelesia unshoulders her bow and withdraws one slender arrow. Aiming, she lets it fly and it lands in the lynx's chest, sliding through the ribs and piercing the heart. The lynx collapses from its crouch, scaring the rabbit it had been hunting away. Approaching her prey, Ilokelesia withdraws her green-feathered arrow from the lynx's chest. Kneeling, she takes her knife out and proceeds to skin the beautiful pelt from it. She lays the fur to the side to be cleaned and with her knife cuts a section of the raw meat from the haunch. Holding it in her bloody hands, she closes her eyes*<br>
