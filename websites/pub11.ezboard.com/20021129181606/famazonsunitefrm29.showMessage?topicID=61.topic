When Xena left, Otere had tried to track Xena and in doing so she was caught by Marauders and killed..making Yakut, Queen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Yakut stood in her Living Area in the Queen's Hut, watching Nefertiri perform a ritual she had been teaching her for the past month. Something kept distracting the Shamaness from her duties. Yakut smirked at Nefey. &quot;Nefertiri, why do you go and take an early lunch? I got some things I need to take care of alright?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nefertiri smiled sweetly, &quot;Of course, my Queen.&quot; Nefertir was the adopted daughter of Xena, the look alike, not the Actual one and only. Though the real Xena and Nefey's adopted Mom both had a rocky past; the two were completely different aside from the looks. Nef walked outside and made her way to the Tavern. Suddenly, Yakut's room turned a mystic blue and visions were placed in her mind's eye. Otere...playing together as little children....helping Xena....Otere's death.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Then a shimmering light appeared before Yakut, a body in shaman clothing began to materialize. A rush was sent through Yakut as she saw who this woman was....Cyane.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Greetings Yakut....last time I had to come to you was to tell you about Glory...How is the little tyke?&quot;, Cyane was one of the most legendary among the Ancients. Yakut was honoured anytime the Ancestor stopped by.<br>
<br>
&quot;She's wonderful...May I ask why have you come?&quot;, Yakut was called on by the Ancients to do many things but Yakut never complained. She felt honoured to be a Messenger of the Ancients. Yakut could guess what Cyane was here for, but she would let the Amazon tell her herself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Otere is to return to you...There is an Ancient ritual where-in your blood mixed with Otere's ashes could bring her back...&quot;, Cyane was very blunt but most Amazon were...maybe it was genetic?<br>
<br>
&quot;But if I mix my blood with her ashes doesn't that make her my sister by true blood?&quot;, Yakut loved this idea though she always considered Otere a blood sister anyway. This would actually make it official. Cyane knew Yakut would know exactly what to do and where to go for this ritual. So in that same shimmering light Cyane was gone and so was the blue light that filled Yakut's room.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Yakut rode off leaving a note to Raven and leaving her younger daughters to Shyriana. She traveled day and night til she reached the sacred grounds. She searched and searched until she found the cave.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Shamaness entered and immediately found the urn holding Otere's ashes. With great care, Yakut spread the ashes out in a way to look somewhat like a body. She took out her ceremonial dagger and sliced her palm enough to draw blood. The crimson dripped down her hand onto the ashes and some drizzled down her arm. Her chanting began as she found that inner stillness. She went to the center of spirit and nature which is Self. Yakut found her way to the Land of the Dead, opening the gates she stepped inside and walked through out. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the shamaness stopped in her tracks. Before her very eyes, there she stood the one woman who could read Yakut like a book, Otere. Yakut approached her sister with smile, and took her by the hand. She lead her sister's spirit out of the Land of the dead. Yakut's spirit collided with Otere's and they traveled back to Yakut's body. When they arrived collided as one, the ashes of Otere began to swirl, as the blood began to run through and soaked the remains til a body had formed. Otere's spirit shifted from Yakut to her own body. <br>
<br>
Yakut was so happy, she immediately hugged her sister. &quot;Welcome Home, Otere.&quot; Otere of course returned the hug. She pulled back from the embrace with a smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;What have you been up to? I hear you have 4 kids and a twin sister?&quot;<br>
<br>
((Yup, Now Otere and Yakut are true sisters Spirit Sisters. YAY!!!! LOL )) <p>§-:¦:-§ Yakut §-:¦:-§ <BR>
