She knew how well the Amazons fought, and how great they are. But it was natural to feel nervous for them. She would help them if they called to her. She would watch as well. The Amazons were like her children to her, since she would never have a child of her own. She sat back watching....waiting...~<br>

She prayed for her Sisters well beings... and for their health.  She prayed to Artimise to guide their arrows and slings... she prayed to Hera to protect them with a Mother's hand... She prayed to Aphroditti to keep their spirits and hearts high... She prayed for Queen Hypolites wisdom and for her guidence in this time when it was most needed... she prayed for the ones that would be injured...and most of all those that would die...whom she prayed again for to Hades... She prayed to Hermies and Iris to speed their way... and She Begged Zues to be merciful and offer them good weather so they may travel unburdened... The Sun set... and the Moon rose high over head...

Maybe you dont mind if your disrespected. But I do. But i wont be starting trouble with the Amazons. If it werent for my dear brother and his hormones...half of them wouldnt be here right now. ::she pushes some hair from her eye:: I too will help with there war as much as I can...As long as I get to kill people and make people fight. its all in good fun. But the Amazons...they are fun to watch fight. There is such hatred in them, even the peaceseeking ones, when they fight...and I like that....<br>
<br>
I will apologize to Hippolyte to her face for bursting in on her and demanding of her, even thought she is a mortal...But i will do it on my own time when her little Goddess friends arent up her ass..<br>
<br>
I'm going to the Northern Lands now....tata<br>
