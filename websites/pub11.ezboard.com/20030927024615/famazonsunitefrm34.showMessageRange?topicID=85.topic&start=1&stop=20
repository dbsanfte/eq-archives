&quot;If you know whats going on in my head...then why do you put up with me, when our likes are and treatment of those we percieve our enemies, are far different from each other?&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked to Solari, then back to Terrayus. <br>
&quot;As for that slut comment. Enjoying ones body with your own, does not make you a slut, wether it be with one person or three, as long as you do not do it while you are commited to another. You, are not a slut Terrayus. As for no fighting, I did not come here to fight with Solari.&quot;<br>
She walked to Solari and put a hand out.<br>
&quot;I came here to call a truce and put the past behind us.&quot;<br>
She looked to the War Queen. <p>Queen Velaska of Lesvos Island<br>
High Priestess of Hera.. <br>
Warrior for the Amazon Nation.. <br>
Year round Bad ass..<br>

 &quot;Yes, it is time to put the past behind us. But just one more thing to settle between us.&quot; Solari said as she sent a right hook to the queens' jaw, sending her to the floor.<br>
 <br>
Erin giggled with delight at the fall, thinking it was play time, she grabbed her mother's leg..as if tackling her.<br>

<br>
&quot;Theres nothing wrong with Moranna, shes just a bit weird.&quot;<br>
<br>
She called back to her wife. She looked up and took Solari's hand to get herself back up.<br>
