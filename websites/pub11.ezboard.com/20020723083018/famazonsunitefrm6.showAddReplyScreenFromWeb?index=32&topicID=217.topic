The branches of the trees around him rustled furiously as he past, as if the forest around him knew who he was.  He could feel Vyiana’s arms around his waist, knowing that she could easily just fall off through the rough travel.  Corpus could smell Nicala and Scythe not to far off, and he was not pleased.  He gritted his teeth and cursed under his breath.  The only way he could possibly loose them was to travel towards the Shallowlands, however, that would pose too risky as that was now the lands where the Shadowking, Juride, ruled.  <br>
<br>
The Shallowlands, Corpus thought.  The land where the Amazon/Saurian wars took place… The black marsh, once rich in plants and wildlife, was now a dismal swampland cemetery.  Rumors had it that Juride had built a new tower there, and dark things old and new dwelled under his darkness.  It was a desperate choice to make… The amazon and wolf would never survive a trek through there… but the risk was too great.  Corpus needed Vyiana alive, and Juride would take any advantage to stop him from his quest.  No.  V’Stakk cleared his mind and pulled off from the main road and took another course.  <br>
<br>
He needed time to think.  He could not ruin his mission.  As he came into the amazon lands, he remembered seeing an Inn near the Black Sea.  That was his decision… To the Black Sea Tavern and Inn… <br>

He turned around and trotted back towards Vyi and extended his hand.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We cannot waist time,” he almost growled.  “Time is of the essence and we must make it to the Black Sea Inn before night.  Many awful things lurk within the shadows and they will be after you.  Come!”  His once gentle tone now became demanding.  She could almost hear a slight hiss within his breath, nothing human about it at all.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He looked up to see the amazon and wolf closing in, and there was no time.  As Vyiana turned around to see Nicala, Corpus quickly struck her in the back of the head, knocking her out, and grabbed her.  He took off again with speed, leaving behind a trail of black dust. <br>

The blonde amazon looked to him and nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes I saw it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nicala turned heading back to the village as quickly as she could, and Scythe was joined by other wolves of the forest as he went chasing after Corpus and Vyianna.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
<br>
Nicala almost collapsed as she neared Scynthia's boundaries before Sariah and Alysia greeted her with Aeceus, Alysia's head wolf at their side. Alysia looked down.<br>
<br>
&quot;He took her?&quot;<br>
<br>
Nicala nodded lightly with a look of defeat and anger in her eyes.<br>
<br>
Alysia turned her eyes upwards and then sighed lightly. She knew she would have to use her &quot;Goddess&quot; powers to help track them.<br>
<br>
<br>
-------<br>
<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Scythe and the wolf pack were closing in on them. The scent of an amazon was on Vyianna, and the man sure smelled like an enemy so it wasn't hard to eventually find them. Sooner or later their Queen would join them and destroy the enemy at large. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ucorpusvstakk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Corpus Vstakk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#993300>(4/10/02 10:49:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=217.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nicala and Scythe</span><hr size=1>         Thunder echoed by the stamping hooves of the speeding horse.  Lightning crackled over head, and Corpus held on tightly to the reins and Vyianna.  She was a prize most precious to him and he could not risk defeat.  The questioned remained, why did he do it?  What would Corpus need with Vyianna?  There were many rumors amongst the gods of a child born of Heaven’s angel and an Earthly goddess.  A child of both Alysia and Eli would naturally be blessed with great powers.  However, the world had lost its memory of this child, due to the black magic of Juride, and none knew of her existence… except for Corpus.  His eyes would glance up to the skies and see the unnatural formation of the clouds.  Dark clouds began to trail in the sky, following the once Saurian king.  His horse was growing weary and slowing it’s pace.  Corpus knew he had no choice but to stop and fight his way to freedom.<br>
        “Come now, you filthy mongrels.  I’ve slain rats more fierce than you!” he yelled out as the rain began to pour down above him.  He unsheathed his blade, which shimmered with a blinding radiance.  “You know who I am!  Come and try and kill me!  I am <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> CORPUS V’STAKK</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->!” he continued “Emperor of Varsith, Lord of the Saurians, Master of all who oppose me!” <br>
        He saw the wolves closing in and he gave out a low hiss before a light sigh.  Gripping the hilt of the blade, his knuckles turned white, eager to once again go to war with his enemy.  But something stopped him.  The rain fell harder, as if washing away that anger, and he sheathed his sword.  Closing his eyes, he spoke to the wolves.<br>
        “You must understand… This I am not here to cause harm to anyone.  Just let me be, and I give my word not a hair will be harmed on her head.  You smell the blood of an amazon within her, but there is also that of an elisian.  I spoke no lie… She is the second avatar… the New Elisian.  I must take her away, and speak with her.  Lift your eyes and look to the sky.  This is no storm of nature.  It is a storm of Heaven.  It is hard to understand now, but…” he stopped for a moment.  He looked back down to the wolves and muttered, “Dogs.  They are just dogs.  Oh Corpus, you’re too old for this.”  He jumped back onto his horse and smirked towards the wolves.  “There are far worse things to fear than me, dogs.  A fair warning… Earth is changing, and a war greater than the saurian/amazons will come upon you: <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Shadow and Light, Heaven and Hell<br>
Secrets revealed, <br>
In time it will tell.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Wonderful and amazing secrets they are.  Each one will have its effect on mankind, and nothing can stop it.  Its coming, like a storm,” he glanced up to the crackling thunder, which seemed to move around above him in a protective manor. “All what you can do now is wait, and see.  Give Alysia my regards.  I will be seeing her in the future.”<br>
<br>
        He wrapped his cloak around Vyianna and held her close, securely, before he rode off again.  Lighting fell from the sky and struck down yards in front of the wolves, as if a warning not too follow.  Things were afoot, indeed… and tales yet untold.<br>

The wolves were not dogs indeed, they were spirits of what was once there. Tretmolecs. Life. Love. And in the end. . .  the destruction because of the Saurians.<br>

<br>
Lightning came and they stopped. They could go no further without their Queen.<br>

<br>
Alysia, and the rest of her guards approached the wandering pack of wolves. Alysia's eyes quickly met with Scythe's and she knew who the man was.<br>
<br>
&quot;No . . . Saurians can't become human!&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked into the distance. Why was she following after this girl who she knew nothing of? What of the Elisians? Who cared? Something inside of her told her that there was a key there.<br>
<br>
She lept onto her white mare and took off into the distance reaching out for a clue to where she was really going.<br>
<br>
And now, the question was:<br>
<br>
Was this a rescue mission for Vyianna? Or Samsara's need for revenge against the blood of Vstakk.<br>
