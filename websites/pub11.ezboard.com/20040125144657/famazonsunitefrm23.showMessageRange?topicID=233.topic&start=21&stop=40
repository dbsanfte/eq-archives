She was kind of a myth within herself but Apollo had laid eyes on her and could now decree that she was for real, and never did a lie escape the god of truth's lips.<br>
<br>
His golden sun-like aura hissed about as it tried to ward off the imposing darkness. The room was filled with so much darkness it appeared as if Apollo was entrapped in a forcefield, a circular orb of magnificent golden light.<br>
<br>
Apollo trotted over to his throne to the left of Zeus's, the one he had stolen from Dionysus. A smirk played upon his lips as he sat in the throne closest to Zeus's besides Hera's herself. It made him feel important, more important than he already was. He shook the golden hair from his eyes and looked at everyone in the room, feeling more secure now that he was seated in his throne. <p>      *~*The Golden God*~*

<br>
&quot;I've just come back from a hunt with Artemis if you must know. What sparks my curiosity is as to what brings you all to Olympus of all places? Is there some kind of convention the rest of us failed to know about for the past couple thousand years?&quot; he smiled to them all.<br>
<br>
The clapping of sandels on the marble drew Apollo's attension to the entrance hallway into the throne room. The sandels belonged to that of Artemis his sister who was as dark as he was light.  He smirked as she would probably be able to chat it up with most of the people in the room more easily than he could.<br>
<br>
As Artemis made her way over to Apollo the room seemed to grow lighter as their golden and silver aura's shone magnificently together. The Divine Twins were united and as it seemed not a hand would be layed upon them. Apollo's face contorted as Artemis ruffled his hair, his laurel crown fell to the side. He laughed and punched her arm playfully before sighing and resting his head in his hand. <p>      *~*The Golden God*~*

&quot;Actually the hunt went quite well. I  bagged myself a huge buck, took Art and myself to pin it down and slit its throat after it fell.&quot; he displays the blood on his arm.<br>
&quot;Not my battle wound.&quot; he rubs the dried blood from his arm. Looking down at his messy attire, Apollo raised his hand and snapped. Soon the room filled with light (well as best it could under the circumstances) and Apollo appeared clean in a new black tunic, his crown sandels and jewels all of gold. <br>
<br>
Apollo's leg crossed, his sandel falling and hanging on his big toe as it bobbed back and forth. Apollo snapped and almost instantly after Hebe the cup-bearer strolled into the room with her entourage of nymphs. They all held platters with either goblets of nectar or bowls of ambrosia and platters of baklava.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just a bit of Olympian hospitality for you all.&quot; Apollo smiled and waved his hand dismissingly at the bunch as if to say &quot;proceed and enjoy&quot;. <p>      *~*The Golden God*~*

Here was one god in the room that he could trust, and when Artemis entered, he almost blew his cover by cheering for joy. Whilest the gods were all 'chating' among themselves, Madmartigan took the liberty to sneak across the floor, and set himself upon a shadow beside Apollo's throne.

A smile still graced his face, a smile full of triumph for he had ALWAYS had this sneaking suspision that Hypnos had an ace up his sleeve. Apollo knew he was waiting for everyone to show their deck, so that he could triumphantly flash his royal flush and end the game for all. Being the god of prophecy Apollo had known this, everytime he looked Hypnos in the eye, every time Hypnos smiled, he had this mask on, to his 'friends' and to his family, it was all a hoax.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you'll excuse me...&quot; Apollo said with a smile, he stood from his throne and grasped one of the arms of Madmartigan's cloak and led him into one of the many halls of Olympus. He shooks the sandy blonde hair from his eyes and inquired:<br>
<br>
&quot;You know something I don't. And I want it, you know I want it. And Madmartigan I know you know that in one way or another over the years I have helped you. And if there is anything you owe me it is to tell me what the 'Silver-footed' Hypnos has half-baked against me.&quot; his expression was not of urgency or anger, it was actually quite soft as he spoke with his friend, he knew he could foul whatever Hypnos had up his sleeve, for he was Apollo. Enough said, and no third tier god of all imaginary was going to put any kink in his plans to wind up on top.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, Mad, I am trusting you to tell me the truth. I will be able to tell if you are lying. As God of Truth I can smell a lie, or a misfabrication from a mile away. Now...let us hear this 'something' he is up to...&quot; Apollo smirked and crossed his arms. <p>     *~*The Golden God*~*

Normally Hades would be infuriated by the presence of a mortal among immortals, however Olympus was not his jurisdiction.  If Zeus allowed mortals to come and go on Olympus as they chose, so be it.  Only three mortals have ever made it out Tartarus once they entered.  Two fought their way out, and one managed to soften his hard heart.::<br>
