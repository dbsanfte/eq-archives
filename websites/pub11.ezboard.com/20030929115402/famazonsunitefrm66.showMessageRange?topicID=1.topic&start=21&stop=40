<br>
 &quot;Romans. Easy.&quot; <br>
<br>
 Dawn nodded, taking two swords from her sides, she stuck them into the ground. They were well made, silver hilts; polished in beautiful form and texture, with midnight black blades, the sharpened tips jagged and tempting. She stuck them into the ground, pulling another sword from her back, and doing the same, it was of the same material only gold in color.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Swords.. they're good at combatant forms like that.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn pulled from the scabbard, a bow, and quill of arrows, tossing them to Hippolyte.<br>
<br>
 &quot;They aren't as skilled with arrows. Good aim, easy take outs.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn's eyes twinkled with every weapon she pulled, her daggers from her ankles were laid out next to the swords, and a knife from a scabbard around her thigh was held in her hands.<br>
<br>
 &quot;They're not as dangerous as you think. I've killed an entire army before. What's your plan?&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn stretched, tossing the knife around in her hand. Blade, hilt, blade, hilt. The blade or hilt never pausing long enough to hit her palm.<br>
<br>
 Emeralds glanced to the two women, a comforting smile was offered to them, before her eyes turned back to Hippolyte. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dawnithinia>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0> at: 2/15/03 8:21:50 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daughterofshylock>Daughter of Shylock</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.picturesof.net/_wallpaper/rose_Dsc08151_WP.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 184<br> <font color=#993300>(2/15/03 8:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm66.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Gathering of the Amazons</span><hr size=1> Perhaps it was because every amazon can sense another. Or maybe it was because Hippolyte gave off such a presence to others. Depending on the amazon came the reason they came to her.<br>
<br>
Hippolyte never once turned her back on Alysia. Even when Aly came to Themiscrya an ex Roman, it was Hippolyte who took her in, trained her, it was Hippolyte that was there when Alysia claimed Scynthia. And it was Hippolyte who stood at her side when they organized the Amazon Nation Alliance.<br>
<br>
Though the Scynthian had been away from the Nation for a time now, she felt Hippolyte's presence back in battle, and she'd never allow her athelfi to fight alone.<br>
<br>
She appeared stepping through the woods, right in front of them. She came barefoot and wearing her amazon leathers which compared to most Northern tribes, left little to the imagination. Two large white wolves stood at either side of their Queen. Scythe and Aeceus. Alysia smiled to Hippolyte and bowed to a knee speaking the word &quot;Vasilissa&quot;. And both wolves bowed their heads before Hippolyte as well.<br>
<br>
Alysia rose and smiled to her old friend. <br>

It was no surprise at all the weapons that the assassin pulled out of her &quot;bag&quot;.  Dawn was skilled in them all.  <br>
<br>
Cassandra watched and then answered Lysia, &quot;Just men...I mean they look like Roman men I suppose.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then in walked Alysia with her trusted companions.  Hippolyte smiled and saluted her athelfi.  &quot;Seems Artemis's arrows are awakening the souls of many amazons to our calling.&quot;  She grinned at Alysia.  Hippolyte knew Alysia too felt something happening.  The shamanic nature of the Scythians was well known.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is a village of men...Roman men.  From what Cassandra and Kara have told me...they kidnapped their ..so called &quot;wives&quot;.  Building a town between here and Troy.  But, what they didn't know... is the land is just on this side of the Amazon Nation.  Our land....and as these women are captive.....as amazons..we owe them a chance for freedom.  To taste what we taste...by the blessings of our Gods and Ancients.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;It will be simple...as we did in the past...we will make them fear these woods.  For the wild beasts that live here..do not take a liking to them and their ways.  We will don the masks of our animals....well at least some of us.&quot;  She nodded to Dawn.  &quot;We will work at night...freeing the women...slowely..one by one.   In effect...the &quot;beasts&quot; will take their women...and &quot;eat&quot; the men.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cassandra and Kara suddenly came clue to how the old stories were made.  The wild beasts from childhood...were actually Amazons.  Amazons who freed the women from oppressive villages.<br>

Alysia smiled as Hippolyte included the Ancients in her speach. Alysia then reached against her sides and removed her daggers keeping them well in her hands.<br>
<br>
She glanced into the woods and growled lowly to herself. She then turned her eyes back to her athelfi.<br>

&quot;I will be proud to once again ride with my sisters.&quot; She hadn't gone against a mortal enemy in a long time, Dawn was right. This was easy. Child's play. To Alysia, this would be fun. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">~*~ Jessica ~*~<br>

The look, that look that clued all into her cynicism, shown brightly in the light of the coming morning and end of the evening. This was a mentality and prepartion she could easily tap into.<br>
<br>
 A simple grin slid across her visage, as Hippolyte spoke of the beasts. Dawn was a true beast, taking, and mastering the forms of any creature in the forest, and molding and creating its abilities into both her instinctive forms, and her human forms. This was more than just childs play, this was her hunt, this was more than being a man-slayer, this was being an assassin.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Kill with no remorse?&quot;<br>
<br>
 Blonde brow, rose above a what seemed to be a flowing pool of emerald, as Dawn kneeled, tightening and lacing her black elven boots, shifting her daggers and scabbards to the outside of her ankles and calves for an easier access.<br>
<br>
 Emeralds glanced to the two women Hippolyte had saved, and she studied them for a moment. This would be all to simple, in Dawn's eyes.<br>
<br>
 Being an amazon was just like being a tiger, or a wolf, to Dawn. It was fighting for these types of causes that made her stay, made her ignore the rights of the men around her. As a mother, she wanted her daughter to see the world the amazons created and if fighting for that, was what she needed to do to keep it around, she would. As an assassin, she was blood thirsty, hungry for the hunt, hungry for the blood that danced over her flesh; men were simple targets in that world. As a warrior, it was a fight and any fight that she could win she would take. Most importantly, as Dawn, as Ares chosen, as an immortal women, this was her world, this was what she lived for. Die or die by Dawn's hand, it was simple, it was method like, and it was truth. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fireofthemiscrya>FireOfThemiscrya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#993300>(2/16/03 12:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm66.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Preparing.</span><hr size=1> Lysia nodded.  &quot;Yes, in this case without remorse.&quot;  Her sister had been murdered by bastards like these as a mere child, before she herself had even been born.

A glimmer of a smile danced across her lips, it was nice to see that amazons could still bond together and get things done; it'd been so long since Dawn had participated in something such as that. After a few moments of silence, Dawn wandered to the camp fire.<br>
<br>
 Grabbing a few spare logs, she tossed them into the fire, not giving it a chance to die down. Dawn knew all to well that the forest in amazon territory was freightening to those whom had never been there, and she wanted to make Cassandra and her sister's stay.. a bit more comfortable to say the least.<br>
<br>
 Dawn settled on the ground before the fire, crossing her twin scabbards across her lap, she folded her arms and hands over them. Sitting comfortably indian style, the amazon fell into a trance, her emerald pools settled on the fire. The only meditation Dawn ever did, was this, before fights, battle, war, she concentrated, focused, and saw what no one else would see. She scryed.<br>
<br>
 As Dawn fell into her thoughts, and the future, she seemed only to waver in the light of the day, and the fire. Pupil's became canine like, and teeth become feline like. Soon, she would be so in touch with her soul, her entire being that shapeshifting would come as a blur to all those around her, and her fighting would truly become the gift those had always been awed by. The gift that had made her a legend. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fireofthemiscrya>FireOfThemiscrya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#993300>(2/16/03 9:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm66.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Preperation.</span><hr size=1> Lysia accepted the fronds, and nodded.  &quot;An excellent plan... we'll be done in no time.&quot;  She grinned down at her queen, a far more mature one than she'd had as that earnest teenager. <br>
<br>
For one accustomed to fighting from trees, and in them, navigating on the half built temple was relatively easy.  Frond after frond was laid down and secured, with Lysia's usual precision.  <br>
<br>
By the time Hippolyte returned, she'd set her armor aside - though in reach - in deference to the heat.<br>

She then turned and watched as Dawn went into her meditation.<br>
Alysia remembered the last wars they all fought together. Centaurs, Romans, Alternate Amazons, and Rogue warriors. Even the Olympian brought the sisters together.<br>
<br>
She walked over to where she set down her small pouch. She reached in and pulled out two small viles. One, was a red liquid and she opened it, drizzling the liquid on the blade of one dagger. The poisoned appeared as blood. But it was deadly to no extent.<br>
The other vile, she slipped into a small pouch attached to her leather skirt. It was Wolves Blood. The healing remedy that she had discovered many years back in Scynthia. It had been know to heal the most outrageous wounds and infections.<br>
<br>
She then took a seat near the fire where her green orbs stared into the flames. A hint of blue reflected in her eyes, Alysia would always have two sides of her. Aly was her peace. Her inner beauty and love. But the warrior inside was Samsara. Samsara knew no such thing as mercy towards an enemy. They were prey, nothing more to her.<br>
The the fire light her medallions glowed brightly. One Tretmolec, one Scynthian, and one Loire.<br>
<br>
She was ready. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">~*~ Jessica ~*~<br>
