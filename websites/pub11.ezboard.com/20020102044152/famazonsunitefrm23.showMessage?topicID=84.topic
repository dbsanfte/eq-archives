He laughed at a dolphine one that he named, &quot;Alfozinous&quot;. He was in his seceret place. The forest inwhich he had named after his first and greatest love Daphne. But his love for the now, tree-bound, Daphne was wavering as Apollo found himself head over heals for someone new, someone who had been told he liked, but he never admited it to himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh and you two will be so picture perfect wont you!&quot; he mocked Eros, mimicing his voice.<br>
&quot;I hate that little boy...&quot; he sneered as he kicked up some water.<br>
<br>
Thoughts of her ran through his head like the water through the lake. When he thought about it, it felt right, like a bird to the sky, like a fish to water, like stars to the heavens. But he knew such things could never turn out as his &quot;crush&quot; was married. Yes she never stayed faithful to him, but if he had her he wanted all of her not just to be her fling.<br>
<br>
&quot;We would look really young and cute standing next to each other though, would we not?&quot; he asked the dolphin. It squeeled and shrieked and cackled as it nodded its head and flipped back into the water.<br>
He rubbed his face and then rested his head on his knee's which he drew to his chest. From the skies flew down his two pet crows, the pure white, blue eyed Caseopia, and the grey, brown eyed Prometheus. And behind them barking loudly was his pet wolf, Ashley, his fur blondish and wheat in color, his eyes blue. He smiled as his animals had returned to him as the always do. The wind blew, ripping rose petals from the roses, dragging them across the air, and infront of Apollo. The wind whipped around him as he whispered her name.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aphrodite...&quot;<br>

&quot;Tis indeed, &quot;women problems&quot;. Not so much a problem but a predicament. See I have fallen for someone, fallen quite hard. But she is married, and she is not really the marrying type. Everyone falls inlove with her, which angers me because this does not make me feel special. And you all know my extreme need to feel special. I didn't mean to fall for her...&quot;<br>
