No longer a threat to the amazons living, or dead. And for this, they celebrated. Velaska walked to the shores of Lesvos with a few of the amazons, Behind them, they dragged the bodies of the Raft captain and of Hope. When they got to the perfect place to set up. She helped the other impale the two dead, with tips she had recieved from Moranna. Sliding the impale pole through the anus and up until it came out of the mouth, she then strung a rope around the top of the sharp pole and the women pulled it to an upright position, pushing the pole into the ground. They did the same for the other body. A cruel smile edged Velaska's lips as she watched the amazons get the fire for the bonfire ready. When complete, she let out a loud cry, to signal the celebration was ready.~ <p>Queen Velaska of Lesvos Island

Slowely, the lioness began to walk towards the Goddess.  As she did, Sin slowely shifted into her human form.  Unlike the amazons and the Goddess, Sin's skin clothing was furs of the spotted kind.  The lioness in her loved to hunt the leapard and cheatah...and her clothing showed it.  <br>

Trailing behind Ardyn was Aja the tiger given to her by her mother Tyger. The stripped black and orange tiger paded behind it's master as she gathered with the tribe.<br>
<br>
She sat down meditation form before the flames and began chanting and painting her face with protective paint and spreading the paint around the bodies to keep their souls from entering her and her athelfi.<br>

After the short ritual she moved about the group and started mingling with her sisters. <p>~Ardyn O The Wind~<BR> =¤= Amazon Goddess of Virtue =¤=<BR>=ll= Re-Incarnation of the Warrior Shaman Otere=ll=<BR> "What we do in Life echoes in eternity."</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udaughterofshylock.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daughter of Shylock</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(6/15/02 5:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm34.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=31.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PARTY</span><hr size=1> To much surprise, Alysia-Samsara remained a bit quiet as she approached the other amazons. She had in fact destroyed Hope with a single dagger and yet the one who should celebrate the most . . . was silent.<br>
<br>
She refused to cleanse the blood from her hands. Scynthian/Tretmolec ways were becoming more and more clear to the Nation as well to the Queen herself. Death was not taken lightly . . .  especially if taken for the Nation. And Alysia had done just that. She followed Hope, threatened Hope, and with the last bit of Mercy Alysia knew from Eli's teachings leaving her mind and heart . . . she killed her.<br>
<br>
She then approached Velaska and nodded a slight bow in her honor seeing she was indeed Queen of these lands. She then turned and looked over at the body of Hope.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you don't mind Velaska, I wish to take a vile or two of her blood back to Scynthia. One to study, the other to symbolize to enemies of my own, that I am not to be delt with lightly.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked down to two viles in her hand. <br>
<br>
Her senses were well about her as she cast her eyes towards Artemis and Sin. Though she herself was an Ancient and only worshipped that of Gaia in any Goddess form . . . she knew that Artemis and Hera protected the Amazons greatly. She gave a nod of respect to them both and her eyes spoke loudly to them saying: For as long as I shall live, I will protect them all.<br>
