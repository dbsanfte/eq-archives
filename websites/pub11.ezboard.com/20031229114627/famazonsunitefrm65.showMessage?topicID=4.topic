After seemingly endless hours, he finally stood, pulled on his clothing and headed back out.  He'd find company in the tavern, hopefully, that would pass the remaining night a little more quickly than not.  <br>
<br>
He settled at the bar, momentarily, his serious eyes scanned the occupants of the tavern.  He wasn't sure why he was even here as a bit of uncertainty settled over him.  He'd found his mothers, the tribe that he'd known as a small boy, the same tribe that did not truly want him because of his gender.  Yeah, sure, they were nice to him, treated him well when he was among them, but all the same he could not stay.  It was the law.  <br>
<br>
He felt outcast and alone for the first time.  He ordered an ale and settled back in the corner of the tavern to quietly nurse it alone... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=queenhera>Queen Hera</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 250<br> <font color=#993300>(5/16/03 4:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm65.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/lilhera.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Restless Night</span><hr size=1> A woman dressed in a simple black greek dress walked up to his table.

She had watched from time to time as the young boy grew quickly in his birth mother's village.  She wasn't thrilled were he grew up, but it was fine.  He could not grow up in an amazon village.  <br>
<br>
Hera laughed softly as he offered her a mortal drink, &quot;No, but thank you.  Son of Gabrielle and Hippolyte.  It is kind offer you make none the less.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Slowely, she let her covering fall back a bit.  The young man could see better the face that gazed at him.  It wasn't that Hera was worried with the mortals in the tavern seeing her.  But, in Troy, the Queen of the Gods was not widely worshipped.  And her vision could possibly cause trouble for Theseus. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=theseusofthemiscrya>Theseus of Themiscrya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#993300>(5/16/03 10:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm65.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Great Goddess!</span><hr size=1> Theseus had not been expecting a visit from the Queen of the gods.

She had plans for the son of Hippolyte.  But, he was yet to be ready still.<br>
<br>
&quot;Theseus, I wanted to see how grown you have become,&quot;  the goddess reached out and ran her fingertips over his cheek.  As if by pure sight, she could not get a good look.  In this movement, the young man could see where Hippolyte had gotten that caress from.  &quot;And I have to say, you are very handsome.

Several eyes had seen the woman touch his cheek and smirked knowingly at the boy and the woman.  The reactions of those few were not lost on the boy.  He took Hera's hand.  &quot;I believe we could have a more private discussion in my quarters.

She could feel his strong youth thru his palm.  Only an immortal could sense his actual mortal age.  Tho he looked the age of a teenager, Theseus had the lifeforce of a five year old.  His energy was strong and easily reginerated when he would be wounded.  This was a blessing from the Goddess to him and his mothers.  For the son of an Amazon Queen would face many challenges.  And in Troy, Theseus was about to face an challenge only the Gods would know.<br>
<br>
As they reached his room, Hera forced the door closed behind them at will.  Then she lowered her hood, revealing her crowned auburn hair and the light of the room quickly reflected in those icy blue orbs.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Theseus,&quot; She began, looking to the boy.  &quot;I understand you have joined the Trojan Army.&quot;  As Hera spoke this, there seemed a slight bit of excitement in her voice.
