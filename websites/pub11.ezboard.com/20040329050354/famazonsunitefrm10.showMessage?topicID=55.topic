Gabrielle stood on the large high platform in the center of the village; she clad in her brown bra-like/halter top, and matching battle skirt which was lined with intracate Amazon symbols. Tucked down in her boots were her pair of sais, and across her back was her Amazon sword.<br>
<br>
A smile found its way to Gabrielle's lips as she watched the sun hide and the moon begin to show, she turned her eyes to the Amazons below, all of them stood in attention.<br>
<br>
The was one of her proudest moments.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sisters, friends, Athelfi...Among us is the grand-daughter of Terries. Terries was an Amazon in the truest sense, and it was Terries who gave me the title as Amazon. We owe it to her to welcome her blood as Amazon Princess of Lykastia.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Lykastian Queen saluted her Tribe and they mirroed her image saluting her back. Queen Gabrielle turned to her Personal Gaurd, Tali and nodded signaling to go and retrieve the newest Princess.<br>
<br>
Tali bowed and moved down the Ivory stairs to River's hut and knocked on the door. She heard River's attendants say &quot;Come in.&quot; So, Tali entered and saw the attendant making the final touch on River's outfit. If anyone noticed, it was Gabrielle's old Queen outfit from her days as Queen when Ephiny was alive. The garb had been adjusted to River's body and position. After the attendants left, Tali took River by the wrist and lead her outside and up the stairs to the platform and Gabrielle's side. <br>
<br>
Tali moved aside while Gabrielle filled a silver chalice with wyne from the Lykastian Vineyards. The chalice sat on a cermoniall table that was covered with Amazon designs and decored with a doeskin table cover and feathers.<br>
<br>
&quot;We coronate River Viviana Artemista-Ocher to night as Amazon Princess River of Lykastia.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gabrielle smirked as the tribe rejoiced before returning to atention position.<br>

Though she'd had some fame where she grew up because of her carving, it was something entirely different to be standing here in front of an entire tribe, the focus of attention.<br>
<br>
She wondered if it would ever become easy for her... she doubted it.  But, wether she was comfortable with it or not, this felt right.  There were centuries of tradition behind every symbol used and word spoken on this night.  <br>
<br>
River planted her feet, and looked over to Queen Gabrielle... waiting for the ritual to continue.  She hoped she'd do as well as royalty as Gabrielle had and honor the grandmother she'd never known.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugabrielleofthechakram.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gabrielle of the Chakram</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 189<br> <font color=#660000>(9/8/02 5:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=55.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/heroicgabrielle/images/gabsyprofile.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ~*~The Ceremony~*~</span><hr size=1> The Amazons cheered as River made her appearance. The quietened as Gabrielle raised a hand for silence she brought her arm back down and clasped it with the other behind her back. She looked deep into River's eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;A queen is a chalice. Let us fill you with visions of our history, fragments of a time before we were Amazons,<br>
when cannibals slaughtered our men, and warriors like the great Samsara called on the shaman for a savior from the future, an Atmah . . . the first Cyane.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then reached into a small pouch and pulled out a amulet (necklace) and placed it around River's neck. It was Terries's blue necklace. The Tribe begun their dance around the Platform.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Tonight your coronation continues a ritual passed<br>
down to us through the ages. A ritual of music and movement, a celebration of community and joy, for we are a family, united in sisterhood. We are the creators and our own creations, The words and the music, both singer and song. Our traditions stretch back to the great Gaia herself, mother of us all, a tradition of dance-- of music-- of sacrifice-- of blood.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gabrielle was not one for blood in a ceremony she had changed that law. As the Amazon drumers began beating slowly on their instruments, Gabby took a silver chalice from another Amazons hand and filled it with wine. A bear cub walked up and sat next to Gabrielle's leg, it was Lykatian, the bear Artemis had given Gabby. Bears were the symbol of Lykastia. She handed the chalice of wine to River.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;This wine symbolizes the blood we once used. The blood of our athelfi that have fallen before us. Drink it as a symbol of your honor and loyalty to your sisters, to your tribe, to the Goddess Artemis.&quot; <br>
<br>
Gabrielle waited for River to drink the wine. She had a smile of pride watching River. <p>§Gabrielle§<BR>

It was easy to imagine the dark red liquid inside as blood. The thought made River give a small shudder.  She had no taste for violence.  But, there was no time to dwell on that.  The ritual had to be performed.<br>
<br>
She repeated Gabrielle's words to herself - ' to symbolize the blood we once used. The blood of our athelfi that have fallen before us. Drink it as a symbol of honor and loyalty to your sisters, to your tribe, to the Goddess Artemis'. <br>
<br>
River closed her eyes and lifted the chalice to her lips.  Her first sip was tentative, but then she drank deeply.  Visions came...<br>
<br>
...She saw a red-haired Amazon fall from a tree, and a far younger Gabrielle race to cover her body with her own... <br>
<br>
... the Amazon told Gabrielle to take her Right of Caste, which she did all unknowing...<br>
<br>
... the same young Gabrielle being dressed in Amazon garb, listening to stories of the Amazon... no, Terreis...<br>
<br>
... another Amazon, older and powerful, leading Gabrielle's coronation - Queen Melosa...<br>
<br>
... her mother, brown haired but with curls she now recognized as coming from Terreis, garbed in leathers that seemed Amazon fighting - her sword flashing, her opponents falling...<br>
<br>
Shakily, River came out of the state she'd been in.  She handed the now empty chalice to Tali, as her mind still reeled from what she'd seen.  <br>

Gabrielle took a War Amazon mask from the Table and placed it on River.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail to the New Princess, River of Lykastia.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gabby smiled and pushed up River's mask. She kissed the New Princess's forehead before turning to her Tribe. They stopped immediately.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tonight, we feast in honour of Lykastia's Newest Princess,...&quot;<br>
<br>
Gabrielle drew her Amazon sword and raised it to the Sky.<br>
<br>
&quot;RIVER!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Gabrielle let out a celebration cry while her Amazons joined the fray hollering, cheering and break the group to go dance, feast, chat, ect.. The Lykastian Queen turned to Princess River.<br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome home, Princess River.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled and took River by the hand. She ran down to the dancing circle and began a dance. The flames danced on happy Amazon faces for tonight a new Amazon rose to her rightful place. <p>§Gabrielle§<BR>

She then handed River a small amulet around a golden chain.<br>
<br>
&quot;This will grant you safe passage through my lands, royalty or not, you are a sister to Scynthia.&quot;<br>

She had remained silent the entire time,just watching,and with little emotions crossing her features. As the ritual went on, Xena's mind was flooded with the past and present. Gabrielle had been so selfless then and now,and had grown and matured so much since the first time they'd crossed paths. A soft smile threatened her features;she was proud of Gabrielle who had come so far with an unselfish heart.<br>
<br>
As the coronation finished and all that was left was celebration;Xena saluted the new Lykastian princess;while knowing in her gut,River could make this tribe proud,like those who came before her.<br>
<br>
After saluting the new princess,Xena glanced toward Gabrielle,then turned and strode off to return to her hut. <br>
<br>
Xena still felt she hadn't yet earned her right as an amazon,though she had been initiated into many tribes,she couldn't get over the fact that she had single handedly nearly destroyed the amazon nation in a whole. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#a62a2a><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamazonvelaska.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amazon Velaska</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_purplespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen Bitch</span><br>  Posts: 284<br> <font color=#660000>(9/14/02 8:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=55.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/amaz0nbich/images/smallvelaska.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ~The Coronation of Princess River~</span><hr size=1> * Naturally, Velaska was there, somewhere in the back, watching, a smile on her lips.
