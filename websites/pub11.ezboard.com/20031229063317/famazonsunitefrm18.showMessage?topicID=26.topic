She looked around for anyone willing to teach her as her left hand rested lightly on the sword hilt strapped to her hip. Traveling for many years had brought on the need to learn weaponry, and she was skilled in a few things, but it was putting her knowledge and skill to use for something she really didn't even know that was bugging her. Absently she fiddled with the ring on her thumb and scanned over the amazons around her~<br>

&quot;Oh just like, anything. How you feel about becoming an Amazon, or where you came from or how you got here? Anything really. My bardic side is dying (( ::cough cough:: )) to know about you. I need to put something more than just Robin the New One in my daily scrolls.&quot; <p>§Gabrielle§<BR>

     &quot;Well...coming here was sort of an accident...well perhaps a coincidence is a better word for it. Queen Varia was the one who recruited me, but I had been looking to join a tribe anyways. See, I'm from Greece originally, but was taken to Rome when I was a girl. I was a slave there for...nine years I believe it was...and finally came back home when I was sixteen.<br>
::she smirked a bit to Gabrielle::<br>
      &quot;And that's the short version of the story. I did leave one thing out though. I'm able to communicate...talk...whatever you wanna call it...with animals...mainly horses, leopards, and wolves, but it works with the majority. They call me the Speaker, but I hate the title...Robin's always suited me just fine.&quot; <p>Robin ~Credendo Vides~

Gabrielle noded at the Speaking with the animals.<br>
<br>
&quot;There are a few around in the Amazon Nation who have the same gift as well. Angelique Crowe, Ardyn O The Wind and Storm to name a few.&quot;<br>
<br>
She thought about Rome and her treherous days there.<br>
<br>
&quot;I've traveled to Rome and don't really want to revisit those memories. You've heard of Xena right? The Legendary Warrior Princess?&quot; <p>§Gabrielle§<BR>
