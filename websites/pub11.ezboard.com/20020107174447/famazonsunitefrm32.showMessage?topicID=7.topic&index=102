Suddenly, the horse she was on burst into a break neck speed and into the throng of amazons riding madly towards the approaching army.

A few of the dogs jumped tryng to nip at her, those, she destroyed with the sword,as well as the one who jumped up and gabbed ont her leg, she had gotten that one off, but not before it broke her skin and bloodbegan to pour from the wound. Not caring though, DeL had been through alot worse.~<br>

I agree with your point.  You do what you must but I choose to stay out of this mess.  <br>

I wish you would remain here.  I don't think this battle calls for us.  <br>

His eyes blinking for a moment as he shouted to her over the sounds of battle. He heard the explosions and screaming trying to tune it out for a moment.<br>
<br>
“I made a promise to Thesus you’d return home in one piece. So watch yourself.” <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He turned storming off into the battlefield on the back of his black steed. His large grizzly bear staying next to Hippolyte incase of emergency. The bear offered her a bit more or protection not that she needed it of course. He turned his horse as the explosions sounded closer to him, his long hair whipping to the side from the forces.  Still charged head long towards the opposing side his teeth clenched together as he looked upon the hordes of enemy. His spear tip lowered towards the ground as he road on, the dogs that attacked him were soon impaled. He cast the spear aside once he had finished with the dogs near him. His horse leaping through the row on flames the god had created.   He pulled another spear, as he became one of the first in the charge hurling his weapon towards Poseidon. His hand reaching for another spear as he continued on.. <br>

But, the older amazon was not so quick to rush in...she was cautious.  She had not had enough time to see and calculate all the enemy had offered.  The auburn haired amazon was not the daughter of Ares for nothing.  <br>
She had heard the words of Pentesilea and blinked.  She had barely known the amazon queen and now those words left her a bit shook up.  <br>
Then Alastor had told of his promise..and it was a bit of comfort.  Even if she was unsure of the large bear that stayed near her side.  Like a general in a war...Hippolyte began to direct amazons on the attack.  She was not about to let these attackers gain one bit of ground..not amazon lands.<br>
