Having been given some advise.Bellerophon atop a black steed,rode to Athena's temple.Bringing the beast to a halt,he smoothly dismounted then unlatching a black,ornate wooden box from the saddle.Using both arms,he carried the box to the temple entrance,then set it down.Once pushing the large temple doors open,he again gathered the box in his arms and entered the temple.Walking to the alter,he set the box down on the ground,then kneeling,he unlocks the box,and opens it.<br>
<br>
Saying silent prayers to the goddess,He began to unload the box.Pulling out a pair of golden goblets and setting them on the alter,he then took out a small pouch from the box and a silver plate,setting the silver plate on the alter,he opens the small pouch and carefully empties the contents of the bag into the silver plate,a hand full of carefully cut diamonds,rubys and other pressious gems fell into the plate.He then pulled out a long shawl of beautifully made silk with chin design and too set it on the alter.Next and the final gift in the box,he pulled out a sheathed dagger.Slightly removing the sheath,revealed a golden toned blade,with a handle of ivory,beautifully carved.He too set that upon the alter.Then closing the box up which too was a gift,he sets that upon the alter aswell.Though his gifts were few,they were the object in which Bellerophon had spent quite a bit of time and gold to get,yet he hoped they were worthy.<br>
<br>
He was going to be staying this night in the temple,for some time he kneeled near the alter saying silent prayers in his head,until the night came.He then stood,lightly brushing off his pants then moving to a corner of the temple where he sat and leaned against the wall,arms crossed over his chest,legs crossed at the ankles.<br>
<br>
He'd hope Athena would make an appearence of some sort,and help him abtain some knowledge of how to tame the wild Pegasus.<br>
<br>

&quot;Bellerophon, you see yourself as a worthy warrior in the Goddess's Temple. Behold, I am that Goddess of War, she who sprang from the head of Zeus.
