<br>
The squack of a raven was heard, and as you look up, you notice one fly over the tree's soaring through the air, taking a look around.<br>
<br>
She found a perch not far from the center of the city and landed. Black eyes darting around quickly, perhaps for a chance to see one of the triad of Queens. Or just taking in the lovely scenery.<br>
<br>
Morrigan had left Ireland and her home for a while, to travel, but she would go back at the drop of a hat when she was needed. Not to many places felt comfortable to her, but this place did.<br>

Giving off another squack, she left her perch and began her own tour of the lands, her own way. <p>I am the Morrigan<br>

 This was a bit unsusual for Solari to ask a warrior and guard their opinon. She normally delegated orders. But she was wanting to know what Marpe thought.

Looking around the village for clues, her eyes finally set upon an athelfi making some bread.  She grinned wide and took off over to the athelfi.   Upon meeting her she greeted her, &quot;Yasoo...hey... I can give you two dinar for a loaf of the bread.&quot;<br>
<br>
The sister laughed, &quot;Alright, Marpe.  That sounds good to me.&quot;  She handed a loaf to Marpe in return for the two dinar.<br>

Marpe grinned now holding the bread.  She took off towards the post that the bird had sat on earlier.  Tearing a couple pieces off the loaf, Marpe set them on the top of the post and then walked back to her post.  Giving the bird plenty of room.  As she walked by her athelfi, they gave her strange looks.  But, Marpe ignored them.

At this, she was amused, but also knew what it meant. She squacked and fly from her perch, circling her way down, almost freefalling. Once she was a few inches from the ground right infront of the amazon, she began to shift, the raven's body stretching, the face disforming, forming into a human face, the whole metamorphisis taking place, until, infront of the amazon stood a woman of 6 foot 6 inches. Her black hair glowed red in the sunlight. dark green eyes seemed cold, empty, but something was there. She wore black leather pants, boots and black leather middrift top, showing very sculptured abs. Attached to her back was a claymore sword. She tilted her head and looked to the amazon.::<br>

She smelt the air once more before deciding that there was no real threat. She knew who it was. Being born of the same blood as a goddess did give Solari certain gifts, but the gift of smell and sense were hers alone as an amazon. <br>
 &quot;Please, make yourself at home in the village. If you need any help with anything, just ask. If you ever need to talk, I am in the hut where the road divides.&quot; She said softly, then turned to point the way. &quot;Just down there.&quot; She nodded slightly to her company, turning to Marpe and doing the same. &quot;Now if you both will excuse me, I have some duties to attend to.&quot; And with that, walked down the path towards her hut.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table>
