He looks on Gaia while he speaks to her and his eyes sometimes leave her to look at something else that catches his attention, though he's been on Olympus long enough to get around blindfolded.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know grandmother, you and Hestia are alike. I mean in the sense that people forget what is best in all the creations. You two are very tolerant, for if it were me not being given my due there'd be Hades to pay for it. Especially from those mortals for whom Hestia gave up her exalted throne on high Olympus.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thoughts start to pour in of things that have happened in the many years for which Gaia was seemingly absent. Poseidon picks out those for which he believes Gaia may not have heard about. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well I suppose you've not heard of my plans though Gaia.

Olympus his home. Having fled to a private island in the Aegean for the winter, due to the fact that Dionysus and his lunatic band of cult followers take over Delphi every winter, a smile spread on the face of the jubilant young god as he yawned and  peered from a window in his private chambers. Summer had come, and with Dionysus on a astonishingly long hiatus from the divine drama that is Mt. Olympus, Apollo decided it was high time he showed his face.<br>
<br>
It was first that he wrote a letter to his sister Artemis, in hopes that they could get together for a hunt in the near future. After doing this, and quarreling with a nymph over the poor preparation of his morning nectar, Apollo dressed himself in a royal blue tunic adorned with a golden belt, his usual knee length cape, and golden sandels. Dismissing the nymphs for the remainder of the year, Apollo faded from the palace in a flurry of golden light.<br>
<br>
Appearing on Mt. Olympus only seconds later, his azure eyes bounced around. He heard voices comming from somewhere...ah the throneroom. Walking to the &quot;commons&quot; of the snow-capped wonder that is Olympus, a debonaire smile washed its away again onto Apollo's golden face. His golden, warm, sunlike aura increased slightly as he excitedly entered the room. His smile turning into a smirk as he addressed his family members.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello to you all! 'Tis a wonder that I found you all here, I have just come out of hiatus from a small island off of Thasos and decided that my first appearance should be here. And what a wonderful decision that was...&quot; as he said this he embrassed his distant-grandmother, kissing her on the cheek.<br>
<br>
&quot;...for I bumped it all of you.&quot; he smiled, noding to his Uncle and kissing Demeter on the hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;How are things dearest aunt? I know that it is summer which seems to be your favorite season, everything being in full bloom.&quot; He smiled. It felt good to be home. <p>     *~*The Golden God*~*

<br>
&quot;Here we go Gaia, one big happy family reunited once more.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then Artemis spoke of Poseidon's plans for the punishment of certain immortals. He raised an eyebrow and wondered at her knowledge of such a thing. &quot;Interesting how news spreads so quickly, I thought Gaia and I were the only ones here when I mentioned that proposition.&quot; <br>
<br>
He turned his gaze from Artemis and looked back at Gaia, she stood patient and the god leaned back in his throne. <br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry for the interruption, now getting back to what I was saying&quot; , he said to Gaia, &quot;there are immortals whose behavior is out of line. It seems that they believe themselves to be shareholders of portions of the universe for which they have no authority. Such a one is Hypnos and there are with him spirits of the forests and hills.&quot; His eyes flashed and he looked to the others, his eyes holding to Apollo's most of all.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now I cannot carry out these things on my own, I am but one God and all authorty in the end belongs to Zeus, but with the help of some powerful Olympians this punishment can be brought about. Notably you Apollo and your sister Artemis.&quot; He turns to Demeter as well, &quot;Your help can be used as well, for being immortals does not make one free to do anything and Hypnos has transgressed all bounds. Though my hatred for the mortals has not ceased I have kept to myself, however this Hypnos continues to seek some sort of physical dispute.

His sun-like aura seemed to grow warmer and increase in luminosity as she stood near him. When Demeter addressed him he smiled, bowing his head slightly to her. A smile graced his angelic face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Me? Without stories of adventure? Yes, I do have some which I will tell you later if you'd like. But for you my dearest aunt, I'd conjure some up in my head and sing to you an epic besting that of Homer himself.&quot; He laughed, his voice was still young. The obnoxious booming laugh of a late adolesent less than the belly-laugh of an adult. <br>
<br>
Apollo walked to his golden throne, the one from which he stole the position closest to Zeus. Dionysus's sudden sabbatical brought about many changes, most of them in the favor of Apollo himself. It was now him who sat at the side of his father, not the Hades-bound bastard demi-god whose wench of a mother was scortched to her timely death. Apollo often spent nights wondering why his father would save the unborn half human menace, whose soul purpose for living was to try and steal all he could from Apollo, out the eternal flames of sweet damnation from which the little shrew fated to die in. He sat down with a sigh, the subject of Dionysus was his weakspot, but now that the socially retarded drunkard lunatic was gone, his wounds were beggining to heal.<br>
<br>
His eyes shot to Poseidon as he began to speak, being as self-centered as he is Apollo immediately thought that these gods who &quot;...believe themselves to be shareholders of portions of the universe for which they have no authority.&quot; was a reference to himself. These feelings of embarrassment were quickly replaced with indifference and sprinkled with some guilt to boot; all washed away when Poseidon brought up the name of Hypnos.<br>
<br>
A long complicated history is that of Hypnos and Apollo. With Hypnos being one of the lesser-gods, Apollo never paid the boy much thought why with Apollo being the exalted and celebrated son of Zeus. It was only when Hypnos took it upon himself to conjure up a mirror that reveals the future,which is in direct intrusion of Apollo's patronage of prophecy, did the conflict arise. The second incident was that of the Great Amazonian War, Apollo being on the side of the Amazon's, and Hypnos on the side of what's-his-face from Scotland, or Ireland or wherever he hailed from. A great battle between Apollo and Hypnos (almost directly after that of Apollo and Hecate) had erupted only hours before Apollo ended the war.<br>
<br>
&quot;Poseidon...&quot; Apollo lifted his hand and continued.<br>
<br>
&quot;...I do not think that I have ever agreed with you more. Hypnos, has developed quite the ego problem. Gods, like humans should follow hubris at all times and Hypnos's disgusting displays of pretension and ostentation have appalled me.&quot; Apollo said half describing himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;And I for one, will not put up with his gross assumption that he is as prominent or as powerful as any of the members of the Olympians. Hypnos, the silver-footed lesser god...&quot; and he stressed the word lesser, and again accentuated the word with a condescending tone.&quot;...of sleep has stepped over his bounderies time and time again, assuming responsibilities beyond his own jurisdiction. Father Zeus's and Hera's hiatus is even more reason for us more powerful and influential gods to enforce the maintenance of order and integrity of our divine family.&quot; by now Apollo was standing looking at the others for their comments.<br>

&quot;What a grand family reuinion we have going on here. And yet, I do not see Father or Hera.&quot; She glanced around. &quot;Dang . . . Aphrodite's not here either.&quot; Still a little bitter . . . don't mind her.<br>
<br>
She stood forward and took a seat in her throne which naturally sat on the other side of Zeus' throne, opposite Hera's.<br>
<br>
&quot;And what do we speak of now?&quot; She looked to Poseidon. &quot;Plotting against the Immortals again are we?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ukingenlil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>King Enlil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(7/4/02 12:46:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=260.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://web.uvic.ca/grs/bowman/myth/images/haifa/h35.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> r</span><hr size=1> (This message was left blank) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ukingenlil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>King Enlil</A> at: 7/4/02 12:51:31 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uposeidonkofc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poseidonkofc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 310<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(7/4/02 1:03:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=260.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://web.uvic.ca/grs/bowman/myth/images/haifa/h89.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Justice</span><hr size=1> Poseidon sat silent while Apollo spoke and he seemed to pay no attention to the speech, but he listened well and looked up only after the God finished, pleased that now the two agreed on something worth putting effort and energy into. <br>
<br>
As Athena appeared and blurted out her preconcieved notion of Poseidon's ways he laughed in her face and waved off her little insult. <br>
<br>
&quot;Athena, no not plotting at all mind you. I need to do nothing behind anyone's back here be it you, Apollo or Zeus. But this is not about any futile plottings for a family feud. This is a discussion of things that need to be done by us Olympians. The immortals are stepping out of line, especially these lesser gods who have hardly any jurisdiction for which to work their wiles. So I myself have called for action to put just punishment to these things that have come to be.&quot;<br>
<br>
He looked hard into Athena's eyes, his expression serious and his demeanor hard. There was always another willing to upset his plans, the cycle never ended, but his plans were not self-righteous now and were for the better good, at least he thought so. Slowly his blue eyes fell over to Gaia and he shrugged. <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uthegreatapollo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Great Apollo</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.maialino.it/musica/bsb_nick.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 177<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(7/4/02 1:30:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=260.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.efanguide.com/~hayden/gallery/misc/hayden28.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Back on track</span><hr size=1> Apollo smiled and walked to Athena embracing her and kissing her softly on the cheek. It was not often that he had the opportunity to see his older sister, one whom had earlier on in his life made a very large impact on him. In an effort to sway Athena to the direction of the cause, or rather settle her in a neutral position in which she would not find it necessary to interfere with their plans, Apollo smiled and said to her:<br>
<br>
&quot;I think what Poseidon is saying, in his less tactful way, is that some of the lesser-gods most notably Hypnos has taken increasing strides in the direction of hostility towards many of his superiors. It was put on display during the Great Amazonian War, where he decided it was wise to bump heads with me. He claims to have fathomless power, to which even I nor you have the strength to stop him. It is by his sheer gall and audacity that he finds himself in this rather disagreeable situation at hand.&quot; he paused and took his sisters hand in his own.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you see in your heart that this battle, whether it be political or physical, is not one that you will be interested in taking part in dearest sister I ask you not to. Rather I ask that you not implore us to stop, for if you asked I would most likely be forced to obey. But if to the contrary you find that Hypnos and his slack-jawed hoard of trolls, elves, knomes, and goblins are indeed out of their jurisdiction...and to add insult to injury, boastful of their 'immense' power do join with us. I ask you to choose wisely, as I am sure you will being the goddess wisdom and all.&quot; he smiled releasing her hand. He shook the hair from her face and took his seat on the opposite side of Zeus's throne.<br>
<br>
With a flick of his braceleted wrist a goblet of nectar appeared in his hand. Apollo raised the cup to his lips, sipping it calmly before asking of Poseidon:<br>
<br>
&quot;Poseidon, I question in the hopes that I am not imposing upon any plan that you, yourself, are not yet definite on...What exactly do you suppose we do about this little problem?&quot; Apollo eyes seemed to bore into Poseidon's flesh. It was always a sight to behold, the uneasy peace and the unending but respectful rivalry that would fill a room when Apollo and Poseidon were both present. But this time it was as if the deck had changed, Poseidon and Apollo were both in the same hand...the hand against Hypnos. <p>     *~*The Golden God*~*

The God reached over and took the goblet and watched as the ingenius invention of Hephaestus strolled away. He took a sip of the nectar and let it run down to his insides, before he turned back to Apollo. The goblet was set on the arm of his throne and the sea god cleared his throat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Apollo, do not doubt, my plans are definite, this is a thing I have been pondering on for a while.&quot; His eyes flashed quickly to Athena before continuing. &quot;I do hope that those who are indeed feeling indifferent to my propositions do willingly take their leave without causing a nusance. My plan is not a self-righteous act for revenge but a moral one based on the enactment of just judgement.&quot;<br>
<br>
His eyes met with Apollo's and he grinned, &quot;As you so stated to your sister, this is about the growing disposition of how the lesser Gods feel about their own worth. Beings gods they scorned a gods wrath, and the time to put them in place is at hand, this is how I deem the situation.&quot;<br>
<br>
He took up his goblet again and nearly drained it empty before putting it down again and continuing on. &quot;My proposition for this problem is as follows, we send a messenger to each of those charged guilty to be brought before a council of the Gods. They must come even if it against their will for it is of grave importance. Then being gathered before us Hypnos and his minions will be charged with their crimes and a decision will come about by us who will give the punishment.&quot; <br>
<br>
The God looked around and seemed uncertain but looked back to Apollo. &quot;That is the proposition I have come up with, if you feel you have anything to add that may brush up on it by all means let me know now. Justice must be brought about.&quot; Poseidon raised his goblet high into the air as a salute and finished his drink. <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uposeidonkofc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poseidonkofc</A> at: 7/4/02 2:35:18 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=goddessathena>Goddess Athena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(7/4/02 2:44:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=260.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Deal</span><hr size=1> Athena smiled briefly to her Brother and listened to him speak.<br>

&quot;Hypnos began such a war against our Amazons and for this justice . . as you so speak of Poseidon shall be served.&quot;<br>
<br>
She stood up looking her Uncle in the eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;You think I oppose you so greatly, however you seem to forget that I am the one who decides what is justice around here. So often I am confused with the Goddesses that oppose war. I am all for a good battle, as long as it's done properly without innocent bloodshed.&quot;<br>

Gaia, of course, being that gal she is, had to agree with her grandson. Hypnos pushed the wrong buttons on her  when he warrred agains the Amazons. Of course, Poseidon wasn't a big help either, being one who fought against the Amazons too.<br>
<br>
Gaia cherrished the Amazons for the respected the realm in which she is, rules, and created. The Earth and it's residents are sacred to the Amazons. Gaia, being the Creator, enjoyed the Amazons being because they were of her creation. Maybe not directly or such, but she was the ForeMother of the World and Gods alike.<br>

The Earth Goddess turned to Poseidon and gave a light smiled.<br>

&quot;Well since Athena seems to concede with the plans I suppose we have the perfect giver of the penalties. I have seen some torturous punsishments and been in a few humiliating ones, so has Apollo here.&quot;<br>

He looks over to Athena.. &quot;But there is no clear-cut punishment in my mind. Athena here could come up with some sort of just dealing, none too soft or too hard on the little sub-god.&quot;<br>
