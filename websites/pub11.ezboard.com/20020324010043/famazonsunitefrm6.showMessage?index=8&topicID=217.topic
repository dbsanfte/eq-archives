It is so very difficult to tell what is known and unknown among those of dark intent. Be they gods, mortals or Amazons. I would imagine that even within the sacred sisterhood of the Amazons there have been those who have fallen from grace. I wonder if they also hold ancient runes and those charms meant to purify their souls. Or are they used to keep their darkness at bay, lulled into a mystical sleep to make sure of their never return.<br>
<br>
Most Amazons would think of such things unfavorably. They would prefer the more joyous, bonding activities. But certainly there must be Amazons to watch over the fallen sisters. Those who turn their attention to the dark arts as a first line of defense for the tribe.<br>
<br>

She wore her short leather bra-top and wore a small golden medallion with a wolf on it. Ancient Tretmolec symbols rested on the sides of the pendant and lightly glowed against her skin.<br>

Alysia was known as an amazon of peace at one time within the Nation. It was obvious that this Alysia, Alysia-Samsara was a killer.

Rays of peeking sunshine poured down through the opening within the treetops.  Beside him laid the shimmering blade that only the angels of Heaven would don.  It’s glowed with a mysterious aura as the sunlight touched its never dull edge.  It looked heavy, but was light as a feather to it’s wielder.  It laid close to Corpus as he rested, as if it had grown an attachment to its’ master.  It belongs to Corpus now, and the sword knew that.  The One needed Corpus.  Unknown to the fallen Emperor, he had already begun his mission.  <br>
<br>
Corpus awoken slowly, as any weary man would.  Squinting his eyes at the morning sun, and cursed the pain down his back, he rolled off the bed of leaves and stones.  The battle against the Shadow King, Juride, had taken its toll.  He rested heartily, if not comfortably, lazily stumbling onto his feet.  Leaning against the great oak he slept under, he slipped on his boots and tightened his dull gray cloak over his shoulders.  He looked down to the blade, which rested upon the floor beside him.  Corpus could only stare at it, wondering why he even kept it.  His personal mission was done.  He defeated Juride, even though he spared the being’s life, but something inside insisted.  He bent down to one knee and gripped the handle firmly.  He watched his reflection within the blade, and what he saw he despised.  Ever since the incident with the ball of light, which stopped him from delivering the final blow to Juride, he was unable to return to his saurian form.  He was trapped in a man’s body.  He sighed heavily, and sheathed the blade.<br>
<br>
There was still so much bitterness.  His heart, still twisted, and his mind, still numb, from the pain of memories that haunted him.  Corpus looked north, towards the land of the Amazons.  His eyes grew cold, and his tongue still longed for the blood of the beast women.  There was one, who still toyed at his rage, Alysia.  There had been rumors of troubles up north, and news of great dismay.  V’Stakk did not know that it was, but it was drawing him like a moth to a flame.  <br>

One such wolf stepped out from among the others and looked to her. Aeceus was still with Alysia among the new arrival of Hope, therefore it was Scythe's job to lead the fairly overlarged pack of wolves.<br>

Since Alysia's return to Scynthia years earlier, the pack had grown almost 10 times its original size and the number of wolves grew daily. Soon they would be uncounted for they were such in great size.<br>

Scythe approached the young pup and nodded to him to return to the others. Scythe smiled to Vyiana, as far as a wolf could smile. And he turned towards the caves. Not the caves of the Ancients for only Alysia, Wolf and Belle were allowed to enter without the medallions.

Though it was a Saurian’s war call, this one was much different than the others the Amazons battled a year ago.  It was haunting, and shrill.  Each bellow told it’s own story of pain and anguish.  It was pure horror as a the saurian emerged from out of the woods… A saurian it was… but alive it wasn’t.  A skeleton of a saurian lumbered out, with patches of dried scaly flesh dangling off it’s bloodstained corpse.  Along with it, several more emerged, more decomposed than the last.  They wailed and hissed, as they approached the gates.  Indeed, this was black magic.  Had Hope’s presence awoken the undead saurians?  It was very suspicious none the less, as Hope herself is a being of dark power.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The saurian undead began to lurch their way to the gates.  Hungry for the flesh of the living, their hollow eyes looked up to the amazons.  Suddenly, a man on a horse burst through the bushes, with a sword drawn.  One by one, he took down the saurians, slicing through their skulls with his gleaming blade.  The fiery red horse stomped upon the remains with his heavy hooves and gave out a low snort of victory.  The man dismounted from the horse and looked up to the amazons upon the gate.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I bring no harm,” he said, sheathing his sword and raising his hands above his head.  “Forgive me for intruding upon your land, but I bring dire news!  I have heard of a girl who has wandered through these lands.  She has black long hair, and brown eyes.  She goes by the name of Vyiana… Have you seen her?  It’s about Eli…”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His eyes were filled with compassion and worry.  His voice was sincere and shaken.  However, none of the amazons knew that before them stood their greatest enemy of all… Corpus V’Stakk.<br>

<br>
&quot;I can not help but think, Queen Alysia, of a better reason to allow my respectful study of the burial grounds. The tribes could benifit from my services of protection. All that would be required would be a small item in memorial to the fallen sisters. A rock, or gem. Perhaps even an enscribed rune.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualysiaofscynthia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alysia of Scynthia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 326<br> <font color=#993300>(3/10/02 4:03:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=217.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> Sariah and Nicala stood by Vyianna. Another Devi? The Northern Amazons trusted the Elisians, they considered them an ally. Though none of them knew why (Because no one remembered Aly's and Eli's marriage.) <br>
<br>
Alysia looked at Hope and sighed lightly still covering the glowing medallion around her neck. She turned and dashed over to where the amazons had gathered. She looked to the man on a horse who was now surrounded by drawn swords. She looked to the man and then to her sisters.<br>
<br>
&quot;Calm down sisters, I am here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sariah called off the swords as did Nicala and they stepped back lightly.<br>
<br>
She then looked to the man.<br>
&quot;I am greatful for your generous assistance in defending these lands from the evil that lurks within them, but we can take care of ourselves.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked at the man with curiousness. She knew him. But why couldn't she remember it? Something inside of her said that this was important. But who was he?<br>
<br>
And then she saw her. Vyianna. Sariah stepped forward and looked to the Queen.<br>
&quot;Vasilissa, this woman was found on the lands outside the gates, she brings Peace though. I've never seen Scythe take to an outsider so well.&quot; She motioned to the white wolf who had followed.<br>
<br>
Alysia looked to the girl and smiled lightly. There was something about this girl too . . . something she felt she knew well.<br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome Vyianna.&quot; She looked to the man.<br>
&quot;If you feel the need to attend to the Devi, you should go, however I will send Nicala with you for protection.&quot;<br>
<br>
She nodded to her guard. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uvyiana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vyiana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#993300>(3/10/02 10:15:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=217.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> Remembering her manners she bowed deeply, but as she stood once more, she could not help a certain feeling in her stomach as she glanced to this Amazon Queen.  &quot;Thank you..&quot; She spoke with much grattitude, and then made her way quickly outside to the man who was to lead her to the devi she cared so much for. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugabbyshope.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GabbysHOPE</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#993300>(3/10/02 11:35:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=217.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://images.channeladvisor.com/Sell/SSProfiles/30005913/Images/gabares.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: another time....</span><hr size=1> She could see that the Queen was busy with this newfound concern, no doubt there were many to be dealt with in these lands. Hope made a promise to herself to return shortly. She would make her way to the nearby Paphos tribal lands. Unfinished business there weeks ago would finally come to a close. From there who knew... Myrine... Lykastia... Wherever her travels took her she was certain there would be a return visit to Scynthia. Oh that was very certain.

&quot;Nicala, go with them and keep this woman safe. I have a feeling she brings more than Elisian words with her.&quot; She turned her eyes to the wolves who kept their gaze upon the woman. &quot;For they see things that many do not.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Nicala nodded her head and turned taking the wolf Scythe with her as they followed along with the man and Vyianna.<br>
<br>
Alysia then looked to Sariah and nodded to her.<br>
&quot;You and I have work to do, the Saurians somehow are returning from the dead. I won't loose my sisters to them again.&quot;<br>
