It was to be the start of something new in her life, something that had meaning.  True it was happening a little later then it should have, but that was because she was the restless sort and wanted to see the world outside.  Needless to say it didn't make a great impression on her.  She gained new experiences and skills, but now she knew this is where she wanted to apply them.  Today was the first day of her new life.  She was embarking on a quest to become an Amazon Warrior.  She had many things going in her favor.  Strength, speed, agility, power and good looks.  She figured if she couldn't beat an opponent she could charm them.  But one other thing made the upcoming quest all the more difficult, she was a hothead, inheritated from one of her mothers.  She knew her trainers knew about this and played on it time and time again.  A good warrior keeps their cool.  That was the one skill she never aquired and this was the one she had to have to become a warrior.  And then after that of course every warrior aspired to join the Queen's royal guard.  Dressing her soft leathers she slide her mother's sword into the scabbard on her back and looked into the polished glass.::  Well I guess its time to learn a little control.  ::sighing she pulled on a heavy cloak to ward off the cool morning air.  She'd get a quick run in before meeting with the rest of the initates:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uwarriorquinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WarriorQuinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#993300>(1/21/01 9:55:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=133.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/az/RaesHomepage/gallery2.html WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Warriors Big Day</span><hr size=1> ::Quinn stumbled back into the initiates huts and fell into her bed.

Maybe it was because all the other girls kept becoming preoccupied watching Quinn work.  She knew of her reputation with the younger initiates and she didn't mind one bit.  She was young and not out looking for a lifemate, so why not just have some fun.  After a few minutes of laying on her bed, she dragged herself up and started to unhook her sheath and sword.  Startled when one of the trainers burst into the hut, yelling::Everyone up and outside in two minutes.  ::Quinn wasn't sure she heard the woman right.

Quinn hadn't even been giving time early to break her fast, so a noon meal was just what the healer ordered, other then a few more hours of sleep.  She woke in enough time to dunk her head in a rain barrel and clean up just a bit.  After making herself presentable she made her way across the village toward the feast hall.  She glanced around at the various Amazons milling around and cursed herself that she hadn't taken the time to really get to know any of them.  Granted she saw the stares from the younger girls.  But again, she didn't mind those, it just helped to up her already inflated ego.  But she would have liked to get to know a few of her peers.  Even living in a communal village could be lonely.  But again, she had a goal and that was to become a warrior and friendships might just get in the way at this point.  Walking into the feast hall she quickly filled a plate, then found a fairly empty area to eat. She knew she'd have to be quick to be ready for the rest of her second day in training hell.:: <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uwarriorquinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WarriorQuinn</A> at: 1/21/01 1:14:26 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uwarriorquinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WarriorQuinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#993300>(1/23/01 2:41:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=133.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> A Warrior's Big Day</span><hr size=1> ::After an uneventful Quinn made her way back over to the training field. The afternoon was to be spent with chobos, one of her favorite weapons.  Problem was she had seemed to pick up a competitor.  One of the younger girls had decided she wanted top spot in the class and that meant taking it away from Quinn.  There had been snide comments all day, which to her own amazement, Quinn ignored.  Things were going fairly well and then the trainers decided to have a nice friendly competition.  Quinn went 100% in each round and at the end found herself facing her antagonist .  With a deep breath Quinn tried to get herself focused on the match and ignored the girls dirty looks.  Quinn turned around to take her chobos from a young girl that had been smiling her way all day, when she heard the comment.:: I heard that Quinn didn't even have the nerve to avenge her poor mothers murder, such a shame.  ::Quinn had had enough and turned quickly charging the girl and tackling her around the waist.  The trainers stood back for a few moments to see how this played out.  Quinn had gotten a good hold on the girl and was about to slam a large fist into her face, when she got an eyeful of dirt.  She pulled back and tried to wipe her eyes, but the punch to her eye flung her backwards.  Still wiping her eyes, she pulled herself up onto her knees, when she felt a blow with a chobo to her side and then an uppercut with the weapon to her jaw.  She laid on her back panting in pain and awaited the next blow, but it didn't come.  The trainers had seen the other girl throw the dirt in her eyes and rushed over to restrain her.:: Help Quinn up and to the healers hut.  ::The head trainer said.  Quinn shadow went to help her up when her hand was pushed away and Quinn pulled herself to her feet on her own.  With a determined look through blurry eyes she strode right past everyone and made her way for her own hut.  At least today wasn't going to be a total blow out.  They still had the festival and she might just see Ainia again, if she was lucky.:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://hometown.aol.com/queenhippolyte/spinningsword.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Vasilissa</span><br>  Posts: 214<br> <font color=#993300>(1/23/01 3:26:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=133.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/pleiade3/ehipp.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Warrior's Big Day</span><hr size=1> :::Hippolyte had been watching the training from the distance.

Hipp watched as Quinn had her scrimish with the one girl.  She was far enough away not to be noticed that she was watching.

Exiting the hut she head straight for the bathing hut, ready to soak for at least a good hour in a hot bath. She knew her eye was going to bruise and looks just wonderful later on tonight, but maybe it would earn her a few sympathy points.  She was glad when she walked in the bathing hut to see it was only occupied by a few others.  She choose her tub and set her folded towel down next to it.  Sitting on the ledge she unlaced her boots and threw them to the side, next came her leather trousers, then her leather top.  She looked down her body and chuckled.  She could see a clear outline of her clothes because of all the dust and dirt on her.  Glancing around noticing a few of the people in the bathing hut watching her, she decided to make a show of lowering herself into the tub.  With infinate slowly she eased into the tub and let out an audible sigh.  The hot water felt like the Elysian Fields on her sore muscles.

Grinning, she set her leathers aside and stood, making her way over to the group, watching them play.  This had been one of her favorite things to play when she was young.  She would recreated the most glorious Amazon battles and of course she would be the hero of the day.  She felt a thump against the legs and looked down into bright blue eyes a blonde little girl.  The little girl blushed bright red and took a step back, stumbling backwards, pinwheeling her arms out behind her, she was caught by Quinn before she fell completely backwards.  Setting the girl back on her feet she winked.::Careful, I won't hurt you.  ::the girl continued to play the shy one and Quinn knelt down to get onto her level. Nodding to the group of her friends, who were at this point standing a few feet away from Quinn and the girl mouths wide open.  Quinn held out her large hand::I'm Quinn...::The girl looked at her hand then back up to Quinn.  Seeing a smile on Quinns face she took the larger hand::I'm Mia::Quinn shook the small hand and winked.::So are you a warlord or a warrior?::the girl looked back at her friends then back to Quinn::Uh well, we really don't have a warlord yet...we all want to be warriors. ::Quinn chuckled and nodded.::It was the same when I was a child, I liked playing a warrior too.  ::Mia pointed at her::And now you are a warrior. ::Quinn nodded::Well I'll be an official one soon I hope. So do you want a warlord so you can play this game properly? ::The little girls blue eyes lite up ::Yes, please.  ::Quinn nodded and stood, setting a hand on her shoulder walking her back toward the group. She let the girl do the interductions and they set about to playing the game. Anyone that walked by the group would have seen about eight little girls using one large warrior in training for a trampolen, the laugher of both the girls and the warrior could be heard throughout the village:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uwarriorainia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WarriorAinia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#993300>(2/2/01 1:33:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=133.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Warrior's Big Day</span><hr size=1> ::happening upon the scene, grins and puts a hand up to her mouth for a moment to stifle a laugh... touched that Quinn is so good with the kids.

Quinn knelt down next to her and received a hug from the young girl, &quot;Thank you for playing with us, and I think she likes you.&quot;  With a giggle the girl released her and ran back to her friends.
