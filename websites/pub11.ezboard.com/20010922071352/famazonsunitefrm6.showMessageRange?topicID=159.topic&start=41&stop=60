"So, what brings the "Hero" to the village of Northern Amazons?" she smirked as she asked, folding her arms in front of her.  To some this may seem a strange scene.  For Hera and Hercules had a troubled past.  A past that still was lingering, despite their recent working together.

Then, after seeming to finish with a message, the lioness glances to Hercules and closes her mouth. An almost inaudible growl rumbles from her throat, but then quietens to nothing.  <br>
