He pointed an accusing finger at Alysia.  &quot;This is no goddess.  She is not of Olympian blood.  She cares not about worshiping us as is proper. She wants only your blessings with nothing in return.  On Olympus, there is no such thing.  You give nothing, you get nothing.&quot;<br>
<br>
He continued his dissertation, &quot;By her own words she states..'I do not need the blessings of Olympian Gods because of the ways that we follow. I myself am a Goddess of such order by your rites, and in equality of eachother, I ask a blessing from you on my marriage to the Avatar.'  Be it known from this day forward, that no other false gods are equal to Olympians nor will they be blessed by Olympians.  Our blessings are to be given ONLY to those who live in accordance with Olympian law.&quot;<br>
<br>
His raging eyes then turn to Poseidon, &quot;Dear Brother or shall I now refer to you as Dear Sister, she asked not for your blessing, yet you offer it as if it is a prized gift to this individual.&quot;  He laughs heartily, &quot;And again I will give you her exact words. 'Because of my ties to the amazons, I ask for your blessings as well dear Goddess Sisters.'  Again let me reiterate, the Olympians are NOT your sisters.&quot;<br>
<br>
Again he faced Poseidon, &quot;Cling to your trident dear sister,&quot; his voice booming with sarcasm, &quot;I am the god of justice.  It is written that I am a fair god and a just god.  So therefore, yes, my ways are just and right.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zeus then glares at Alysia, &quot;You are not welcome here as the other gods and goddesses, you hold no title bestowed upon you by any Olympian; therefore, it is of little consequence to us.&quot;<br>
<br>
The furies turn came soon enough.  &quot;Do not speak to me of such lies.  Do not speak of things not written.&quot;   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualysiaofscynthia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alysia of Scynthia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 83<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(5/17/01 8:01:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> She laughed. . .</span><hr size=1> She smirked lightly as she folded her arms looking at the God.

&quot;I am above this sort of treatment brother. If anyone is the girl here it is you. Whinning about this and that. Let us gods have some space will you? You say it is written that you are fair, it is also written that Apollo is all- good. He didn't seem too good to me when he flayed Marsyas, though justly so.

He launched a lightning bolt at his brother.  &quot;You return  to your own realm and do not set foot on Olympus until such time as I see fit.

It was obvious Tisiphone was the one to bring her sisters back. She loved her family. . . as much as a Furie can love of course. She was the Goddess of Vengence but for some reason her heart held a place for each of them. <br>
<br>
She remembered how it felt to each of her sisters when their own siblings were put away for all time. And she missed them.<br>
<br>
She nudged Alecto and Megaera towards Zeus.<br>
<br>
Alecot sighed and looked to Hera seeing Zeus glare at his own wife. &quot;We would like to apologise for our harsh words Nephew. The well-being of Olympus is in our hands as much as anyone else.&quot;<br>
<br>
Megaera nodded and for the first time, she spoke without a smirk on her face. &quot;We respect your place as King of the Gods, but you must understand the position we hold. For we were born long before the Olympians and I suppose we are still holding grudges deep inside for the loss of our own family.&quot;<br>

Tisiphone smiled lightly and looked at Hera.<br>
