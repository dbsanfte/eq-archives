It was rare that they saw this one not on horse back. Something she usually did her morning rounds of the forests of Themiscrya, riding proudly and cautiously.<br>
But, this was the evening.  And the auburn haired woman seemed to be deep in thought...not noticing the world around her.<br>
Brown eyes glance up as she nears the edge of the dark forests.  Beyond she can see the smaller river that at one time, the amazons left bundles of male infants at.  She stopped near a tree and leaned her back against it...still hidden within the forest.  Her eyes glance along the banks....and she softly sighs. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A> at: 6/27/01 7:05:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Vasilissa</span><br>  Posts: 365<br> <font color=#993300>(6/27/01 7:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=233.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/hipprpg.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Quiet walk</span><hr size=1> As her eyes run down the river, she thinks of the village of Gargarensia.  Her brow raises as she thinks of the village of men.  For several years now, she had left alone the place she and the Themiscryan's once had "terrorized".  She thought a bit more about the past ...and then frowned.  For some reason, she had decided to stop the raids upon the Gargarensians.  And never did she know why.  It had just felt right. <br>
Slowely, Hippolyte pushed her body from the tree and walked out into the clearing near the small river.  Fingers reached up and brushed back a loose strand of wavy hair..pushing it behind one ear.  <br>
Arms crossed in front, Hipp walked up to the riverbank.  The river gurgled over the pebbles that could be seen underneath the shallow waters. Kneeling down, she reached out and touched the cold liquid.  Still with her hand in the water...Hipp's eyes turned towards the village of men.  <br>
<br>
(P.S. Hercules and the Amazon Women..time had been changed in the end of the film. and thusly, Hipp does not recall the events.) <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

Sadly, she too knew how the lack of males brought things upon amazon villages. <br>
<br>
&quot;A long time ago, there were two villages. A village of women and a village of men. The village of women were strong and independant, and the village of men were weak and absent minded. The men came to the women's village and attacked it one day, burning it to the ground, destroying every living creature within it.&quot;<br>
<br>
She sighed and paused for a brief moment.<br>
<br>
&quot;The village of women perished quickly, but so did the men for they had forgotten the importance of the women in their lives. And they too died in peril.&quot;<br>
<br>
Alysia's words of wisdom came from the Tretmolec within her, as Samsara she was a great leader, and as Alysia, she was a compassionate sister. The two of them made a great pair.<br>
<br>

"Soft, and well.....you know... submissive to an extent.  But, don't allow them to mistreat you.  But, we need to find someone else to go with you."  Hippolyte glances down at the cold water of the river and thinks about who to send with Dawn. <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

This was surely a task the Amazon could do.<br>
<br>
 &quot;You mean be a seductress.. This should be fun.&quot;<br>

 There was a sadistic grin that ran across the Amazons lips, as she began thinking.<br>

Evil and hungry
I'm just a craving soul
Craving for your blood and death; M'Dear
Don't worry it won't hurt..
Just a dagger or two.. 
Crimson spilling onto my hands..
Running over the flesh to drip from my elbow
Scarring the black leather pants..
Mmmm its yummy
Don't worry I only strike once...
Don't bother to scream... they won't catch me

 &quot;I'll ask Sartha, but I will need a &quot;disguise&quot; and if we have one I'd like to have a map of the village.. so I know ways out.. ways in.. homes..etc.. just to be on the safe side.&quot;<br>

There are only five there and it will be easy to know which one it is.  It is rather worn,&quot; she replied and shifted in her stance and stood facing the village of men.<br>
Then her eyes turned to Dawn, &quot;Find Sartha...tell her of this mission.&quot;<br>
