Hecate raised her hand, wanting them to slow down.<br>
<br>
::What is girls?<br>
<br>
Antare, one of the priestesses, spoke up.<br>
<br>
::Goddess, something's wrong.  We were going after one of the icons when we met some resistance.  Mythen and I took care of things, but the bodies didn't stay down!!  We tried to dispatch them again, but they just got up.  We know their dead, and they acted liked animated corpses.<br>
<br>
The other priestesses nodded in agreement.  They had all experienced the same thing.<br>
<br>
::Girls, Hades and Thanatos have joined us.  But their doing it their own way. Hades has forbidden souls from entering Tartarus and Thanatos has forbidden beings from dying.  So now, these bodies are caught in a limbo-state.  They're not exactly dead, but also not exactly alive.  Their souls are no longer within their bodies.  So what we have here are roaming spirits and living corpses.  But if you are all saying that the bodies are still attacking you, then that means the bodies are still sentient.  This makes things a bit more dangerous.  You can't kill them, but they can hurt you.  Use your own judgement.<br>

At first, Hecate was just going to go about accomplishing her tasks without any aid from her brethern.  But now, she realized that she had better rethink her plan.<br>
<br>
The fact that many of the other gods were missing, or hadn't made an appearance troubled Hecate.  What could they be up to?  Were they going to be a problem in the future?<br>
<br>
For instance, Ares, hadn't even uttered a peep throughout all this.  Hecate would have bet money that Ares would have been everywhere.  He is the God of War, and what greater war could there be besides the one they were currently in?  A war between the Titans, rulers of old, and the Olympians, the present rulers.<br>
<br>
And what of his ilk?  Malice loves bloodshed of which there is plenty of.  The Furies fueled the fire of war.  And since it may come down to the slaying of certain Titans, which also happens to be the parents of some of the gods, the Furies would have a field day with all this.  To them the killing of ones parents was the worse act they could imagine.  And what about Nemesis and Eris?<br>
<br>
Hecate felt for sure that she would have to visit Hephaestus.  There were certain Titans that had to be recaptured, if they had managed to escape.  And there were certain Titans that the gods have to make sure never do.  For example, if Atlas manages to leave his post, the world would tumble head-first into oblivion.  Therefore, the gods would surely have to call upon the skills of Hephaestus once again.<br>
<br>
The question of who allowed the Titans to escape was still unanswered.  Hecate didn't want to point fingers...not just yet, but she had a hunch that once again, Ares wouldn't be too far behind.  If so, the need for Athena would be required.  She always managed to balance out Ares.<br>
<br>
Currently, where are the missing Titans?  To find them, the gods would need two of the best sleuths, Apollo and Artemis.  These two godlings circled the world consistently, day and night.  If the Titans dared to poke their heads out of their hiding holes, these two would surely spot them.<br>
<br>
What about the deep?  Many of the ocean's denizens are direct descendants of Titans.  So could they be hiding there now?  Apollo and Artemis would have a hard time looking into the depths.  Therefore it would be up to Poseidon.  Hecate didn't think Poseidon was a suspect.  But Poseidon held no love for Athena.  And since Ares didn't either, there could be a chance these two were working together, but that all goes back to IF Ares was the cause.<br>
<br>
Hecate's head hurt just thinking about who else was missing and who could be involved.  She just hoped that those who are working towards their cause continues to, and those that can would join.  Hopefully, they wouldn't end up doing the Titans job for them.<br>

Hades himself knew this well seeing as the sisters would travel down to Tartarus and torture the murderous mortals that had died in battles. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ixlordhadesxi>IX Lord Hades XI</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 260<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(5/13/03 6:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=313.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Titans and Death</span><hr size=1> ::Hades perked up a little bit as he heard his name being spoken by Alecto.

&quot;Exactly. Tisiphone can control the undead all she wants, they still will not enter Tartarus. It will be interesting to see however in regards to the dead...can Tisiphone's voice override a command from the Lord of the Dead, or vice versa.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As of now, we wait. They have not yet acted. Much like most Olympians, they simply speak about acting without actually doing so.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Can't you feel a slight increase in strength and awareness? The mortals are so petrified of the living dead that they have began sacrificing black sheep and black rams to us, to take this pox away and allow the dead to rest.&quot; <br>

Her ghost hounds roamed the earth doing her bidding, and she currently had them watching the other gods.  Hecate wanted to know if any of her fellow deities were making a move, whether against her or not.  <br>
<br>
The hound materialized from the thin mountainous air, and bowed before his mistress.  Hecate looked into her hound's mind and understood.  It appears that one of the Furies had left Tartarus and was roaming the world, most likely on some personal vendetta.  Hecate pondered this piece of information.  The Furies united could be a serious problem, but a single Fury would be manageable.  The Furies sought retribution for some sort of injustice they feel has been done to them or to someone they have a personal stake in.  Hecate knew she hadn't done anything directly against them, so she most likely was in the clear.  The guys on the other hand had decided to do things a bit differently.  Therefore most likely they were the ones being hunted.  Yet the Furies never did do things logically.  Their temperament was truly explosive, and anyone caught within the blast, in their eyes would be just as equally guilty.  Guilty by association.<br>
<br>
Hecate couldn't be troubled by that right now.  She sent her hound back to its task.  Right now she had something a bit more important.  She was about to enter this cave, which housed a major temple to the Cyclopes, Titans of the One Eye.  Although the Cyclopes should have been imprisoned in Tartarus, Hecate wasn't sure if they were one of the ones that had escaped.  Therefore there was a chance that she would be meeting them within this cave.<br>
<br>
As with the encouter with the Fates, whenever entering the domain of any of the deities, whether they were currently being worshipped or not, always gave them the upper hand.  In your own domain, you ruled.  Once you stepped out, the playing field became more balanced.  Well she was about to enter the Cyclopes domain, and according to her records, there were three of them.  Although the Cyclopes weren't gods, they did however have the power to rival them.  It had truly been difficult to finally defeat imprison the Titans.  So now, if she entered and all three were inside, she most likely would be able to leave only after a serious and painful battle had been fought.<br>
<br>
Hecate took in a deep breath, and let it out slowly.  Even gods get nervous before a fight.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hecategoddessofmagic>Hecate Goddess of Magic</A> at: 5/14/03 2:45:32 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thanatosofdeath@amazonsunite>Thanatos of Death</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.joerghuber.com/images/art_c48.jpeg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dark Death God</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(5/14/03 4:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=313.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Odds</span><hr size=1> &quot;Hmmm...

&quot;So they think that freezing them up a little would fix things? But that doesn't stop new souls from popping out of bodies... The Fates may have a new job as the Greek deites clean up crew.&quot; <br>
 <br>
*Thanatos laughed softly to himself.* <br>
  <br>
&quot;Well one does not win by doing petty little moves... Excuse me Hades I will return momentarily...&quot; <br>
 <br>
*Thanatos disappeared into the shadows of the room, and reappears in some tunnel of the vastness of the underworld. He walked for a minute and then entered a room were souls were looming around, and doing some teadious tasks asigned to them... This was the entrance to where some of the worst evil souls had be sent to. The ones in front of Thanatos might have been mere thieve and vandals, but deeper inside the underworld is where they were imprisoned... <br>
 <br>
Powerful assassins, warriors, and warlord, doomed in pain for there horrible ways of slaugher and death... Mankind was not ment to do such horrible things, but Thanatos himself did not mind so much. There must have been about 50 souls in the room now, as Thanatos teased him telepathically to come closer... Then took a long exhale... And when he breathed in a horrid wind began to draw towards him. The wind grew stronger and stronger until the souls began to get sucked into Thanatos's whirling robes.  <br>
 <br>
In a minute the room was empty, and Thanatos was very recharged... His eyes glowed red once again, as he summoned one of the worst soul of the underworld... A assassin named Thaneus, named after Thanatos whos life had been dedicated to killing, floated towards Thanatos.* <br>
 <br>
&quot;Dear Thaneus... You were one of my most favorite. Trained in every art of killing... To my recolection you slaughter your own parents didn't you... It was a pity though when the King of Greece sent 200 of his most skilled fighters to kill you... oh how much more glory you could have given to the unstoppable power of death. But now, you are being given a second chance!!!&quot; <br>
 <br>
*Thanatos held out both of his hands and sent much of the power from the souls into him...* <br>
 <br>
&quot;Hmmm... Not enough I sence, to bring you to full potential...&quot; <br>
 <br>
*Thanatos's eyes glowed red again, as this time evil souls from all over that part of Tartarus were brought to the room as there energy was fed into Thaneus... Countless souls had poured into him before Thanatos stopped.* <br>
 <br>
&quot;I think I shall add one more thing to top it off...&quot; <br>
 <br>
*Thanatos raised both of his hands, as the 200 soldiers that were sent to kill Thaneus arose from ground.* <br>
 <br>
&quot;I give you the soldiers that you slaughtered, and that one special one that killed you...&quot; <br>
 <br>
*Thanatos eyed the one commander that have cleverly killed Thaneus, but kill himself in the process.* <br>
 <br>
&quot;Now GO! Go into the world of the living, and kill and destroy..... Split up into small groups to do your bidding, so that it will be a very big hassle to scream at all of you...   <br>
  <br>
Time to send in the specialists...&quot; <br>
 <br>
*Thanatos lifted his hands up as they rose through the ceiling and up to the world of the living, and there the split up and began to do there damage. Thaneus went solo, as he had always had, he had like to keep the pleasure of killing to himself. <br>
 <br>
Thanatos then walked back into the shadows and back into the room he was originally in, cracked his nuckles and sat down, starring early into the seeing pool.* <br>
 <br>
&quot;They under estimate the will of death...&quot; <br>
 <br>
*Thanatos burst into a twisted laughter.* <br>
 <br>
&quot;And so I have moved one of my pawns in the direction of offense.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFF33>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#FFFF33> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23>The Olympian Gods</a> <font color=#FFFF33> - </font><a href="http://pub163.ezboard.com/bmythicalodysseyforum">Home</a><font color=#FFFF33> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3m<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
