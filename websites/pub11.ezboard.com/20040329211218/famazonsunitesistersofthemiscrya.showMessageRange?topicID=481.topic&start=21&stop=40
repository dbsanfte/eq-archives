He knew how it was that a girl became pregnant and he knew that he'd not had any part of that.  He'd never been with a girl before, at least not in that way and he'd certainly have remembered it if he'd been with one like Celaneo.  He moved to catch her as she passed out, but as the fates would have it, he missed and she landed hard on his boots.  He moved out of Lalita's way as she tended to the young woman.  He looked at her almost panicked, &quot;I didn't touch her, I swear it.  We only spoke for some time.&quot;  His heart pounded in his chest, knowing that if his mother got word of this, then he'd be in more trouble than he could handle.  He moved to prop her feet up onto a rock nearby, trying to help in some way to get Celaneo to come back around. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lalitasilver@amazonsunite>Lalita Silver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#993300>(5/26/03 4:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=481.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Problem?</span><hr size=1> After they both get Celaneo under some shade and comfortable, she sits back on her heels, and looks at them both, not very sure if Cel is awake enough to answer her, but needing to ask anyway &quot;Swear it, both of you on your honor, that you both did not do something that will get us all into more trouble then we can handle?

He took a deep breath and settled to sit on a rock nearby.  The hut was practically completed, they just needed to hang something in the doorway to protect it from the wind outside.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table
