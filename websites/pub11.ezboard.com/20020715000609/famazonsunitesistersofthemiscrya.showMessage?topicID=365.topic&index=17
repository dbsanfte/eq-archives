<br>
Upon entering the barn, Hippolyte found a fresh steed and quickly began to place tack upon the mare.  The one she had rode into the village on deserved a long rest.    And Hippolyte would respect that.  <br>

The mare bounded over the brush and fallen trees, with Hippolyte sounding out a wild amazon cry.  Upon her face was a proud smirk, for she knew more where the two were heading.  It was time to coronate DeLerium as a Queen of Themiscrya.  On the Isle of Ares, the priestesses and Marpe had been waiting for too long.<br>

Thru the mist, an island appeared.  A beautifully designed dock held a few priestess who stood waiting and watching.  Hippolyte glanced up at the top of the hill.  There she saw many more priestesses waiting on marble steps.<br>

As the boat neared the dock, Hippolyte could see Marpe.  She had sent the Themiscryan guard to ready the plans for DeLerium's coronation.  It was good to see her familiar face.  Marpe stood proud and saluted both DeL and Hipp as soon as she could see them.<br>

The boat skidded along side the dock into a stop.  Marpe upon seeing the horses ran around to the bank.  Hippolyte nodded in understanding and released the horses who quickly swam to the beach and into Marpe's care.<br>
