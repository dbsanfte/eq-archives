As it cleared, the figure of a very tall athletic woman, with heavy long dark hair, and dressed in black Amazon leathers, boots and cloak became visible.  Around her neck shone her Golden Dragon.<br>
<br>
Flying by Bia had seen Smyrna. She had heard it said on Olympus that things were happening there. So she thought she would pay them a visit.  Usually Bia would have ridden in on horse back, but she'd had enough of horses for one day and had chosen to arrive as was her usual way.<br>
<br>
She hoped the Amazons of Smyrna might welcome her and also learn that she wished to befriend them.  Bia much admired the Amazons and was glad of the opportunity to visit them, when her duties on Olympus allowed her.<br>
<br>
Gathering her cloak and her bow, Bia's full lips parted to form a huge warm smile.  She walked towards the village wondering whom she might meet.........................<br>

Kala didn't really see a threat in Bia,and gladdly walked over to meet Bia half way. &quot;Greetings.&quot; She nodded to Bia. &quot;Who goes there?&quot; She questioned.

She smelt Bia wasn't an amazon or mortal,and quickly she bounced to the side,darted over behind a tree,then darted over to Kala. Before she would bump into Kala,she dug her paws into the ground and skidded,slid then came to a stop at Kala's side. <br>
