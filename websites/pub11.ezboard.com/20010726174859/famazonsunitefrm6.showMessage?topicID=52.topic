As she gathered white bandages, ointments from her leather pack, and water from the well.  As she prepared the hut, she chanted to Yhi.  The old aboriginal tongue dancing on her lips.  She knew this tribe needed Yhi's blessings to survive the onslaught around them.  All she could do was pray that the Centaurs would leave this hut alone.  Soon, an amazon was brought in by her sisters and Arahuta helped the warrior to a short bed.  Ara began to tend to the wound that was an arrow piercing her right side.  Ara breathed deep, brushed a tenderil of hair from her brown cheek, then began chanting. She bent the warrior around and broke off the arrow part was sticking out her back.  Then the shamaness wrapped long fingers around the stick of the arrow, and the other upon one shoulder to keep the warrior down. She looked to a young girl who had come to help her.::: <br>
Now, Trilla, I need you to get that hot rode out of the fire over there and bring it here.  :::Trilla did this quickly and kneeled back beside Ara:: <br>
When I pull this arrow out.  You must burn the wound, quickly.  Do you understand this? ::: Trilla noded and said yes. Ara looked back to the warrior who watched intensly.  Arahuta smiled::: <br>
You will be alright, warrior. :::As she said that she quickly pulled the stick out and Trilla burned the wound. The Warrior shreaked and then passed out. Ara quickly spread ointment upon the wound and smiled::: Well done Trilla.  Now we should let her sleep and prepare for the next one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kalaamznwarr>KalaAmznWarr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#993300>(11/30/00 8:53:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Out of the battle and into the hut.....</span><hr size=1> Kala had managed to get the injured amazon;whome she saved from a stomping centaur into the healing hut and out of the battle.She set aside the bloody sword she had been carrying against the nearest wall,and looked to Arahuta.&quot;I need som help,this Amazon has a large gash on her stomach...&quot;Kala motion to the very injured amazon she had nearly carried into the healing hut.She then helped the injured amazon to an empty bed,and layed her down.<br>

Ara began to check her vital signs.  Rishkae was still breathing.  The Shamaness found that Rishkae had been cut near her neck, and was loosing lots of blood.  She set to sewing up the wound as quickly as she could.  Sponging off the blood as she did.  She was now wishing that she knew more about the magical healing arts. And was wishing that one would show up.  Surely, Queen Alysia had healers.  Ara got a bowl of fresh water and began to clean up Rishkae's wound.  As she did this she began to chant.  The room began to grow dark and a then it lit up w/ a smirling mist of star like lights at the top of the hut.

She looked up to Ara, realizing she had never formally talked to this sister, the shamaness. &quot;Sorry about my enterance there, I shouldve dropped off on a bed.&quot; She grinned. &quot;Will I be kept here until the end of the battle, or will you let me go...&quot; She longed for the now clean, sword in the corner <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rishkaeamzn>RishkaeAmzn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon </span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#993300>(12/2/00 6:57:15 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ::Looks around::</span><hr size=1> Where was Azz? ::She searched the tent, seeing only the other lone amazon:: She looked over at Ara, no longer waiting for an answer.
