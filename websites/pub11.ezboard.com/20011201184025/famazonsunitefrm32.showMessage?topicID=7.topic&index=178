<br>
She moves her neck from side to side,popping it,then stands back up and seeing everyone by now is pre-occupied...she just happens to go into a frenzy now....<br>
<br>
With a growl,her body tenses up,and suddenly she goes into complete transformation. Her entire body becomes encased in those deadly spikes,her usually soft,tan skin becomes rough and pale grey,her eyes turning from green to grey. A transparent second eye lid covering her eyes to dull out any bright lights.She becomes completely un-reckognizable with this change.<br>
<br>
With no notion of who are her friends,allies or enemies. In this case,everyone was her enemy.<br>
<br>
With low incoherent mummbles she runs into the actions,her arms slashing to and fro,those long spike on her arms slicing through soldiers AND amazons,killing them quickly or just causing painful wounds.<br>
<br>
She comes face to face with a large soldier and suddenly rushes at him,her hands out infront of her,as her hands are clentched into fists. And as she come mear inches from him 4,5 inch spike petrude from her nuckles on both fists. She jams these spikes into his chest,then with little effort she lifts him off the ground,bringing her arms up quickly she throws the soldier over her back,not bothering to look back to see if he were dead.<br>
<br>
She then turns quickly to the left,as someone catches her sences.An Amazon. Not careing who it is,she quickly brings her arms up,then down sending those spikes from her wrists down into the Amazons chest,causing the amazon to gasp and fall quickly to her knees. As the amazon falls,Zelia yanks her arms across,causing her spikes to slice open the amazons chest. As the amazon falls dead,she pulls her spikes back,then takes off to find more prey.<br>

She then gets her arrows, and sets them in place of her bow. She shoots to the left of her, hitting anything that comes near varia, del and alysia. Killing solders and some fanged things. She sees Hypnos in the distance, fires and shoots her arrow at him, hitting him, not sure were (u pick). Then she fires and hits Fogstone, in the leg. She turns to the right, loading her bow. Shoots at the solders getting closer to the rest of the amazons. She is kneeling in front of the tree, so she is protected from anything fireing at her. A Solder comes charging at Maytha, she didnt load her arrows yet, so she pulls out her dagger and throws it at the man. It ducks and she misses. Maytha stands and kicks the guy in the gut, then trips him to the floor, and then pulls out her sai, stabbing him in the chest with such force, blood trickles off and lands on her neck and chest. Just as she stabs him, another solder comes from behind and knocks may in the back of the neck with the hilt of his sword. She falls foward. The Solder then kicks in her back, shes yelps in pain. Not relizing she is laying on her stomach. Just as the solder is about to stab her with his sword, She pulls herself forward, and at the exact moment, she grabs her dagger that was on the ground, throws it at the man, the dagger hits his heart, as his sword stabs into maythas leg. Man falls back dead. Maythas leg is imbedded in the sword into the ground. She tries to pull it out...but is in to much pain...<br>

Clouds come forth at his bidding and huge storms open up into the land, lightning spliting trees and at times hitting unlucky victims dead. Thunder snaps so loud that rocks crack and eardrums break in pain. The dirt turns to mud and soon is drowned in the deepening rains that come down hard like needles.

Poseidon's eyes fall back into his head and he falls down to the earth. His trident falls beside him and then he sinks slowly into one of the open fissures being partially buried under dirt and rubble.
