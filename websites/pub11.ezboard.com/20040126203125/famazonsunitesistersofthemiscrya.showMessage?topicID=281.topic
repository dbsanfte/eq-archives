She had been skining, gutting and chopping the game that she and other amazons had hunted.  It looked like Themiscrya's supply of meat is now way up, which is a good thing if the Amazons want their strength.  She had heard the storm outside and had smiled through her work, she always did love a good storm.  She had just finished transporting all the meat down into the little room under the hut where it would be cold and dry, good for curing that meat and was now cleaning up the hut.  Minutes later she had emerged from the hut, her hands clean of the mess after washing them in a tub of water inside.<br>
<br>
She walked against the wind, through the village as the rain had started and was now falling harder and harder.  Her hair blew behind her, soaking wet and becoming tangled and her furs and leather were now drenched in the cold rain.  She had approached the gates of Themiscrya and had moved over to a tree.  She knew the others wouldn't go near trees during a storm, but she did.  She grabbed hold of a low tree limb and pulled herself up and sat on the limb, holding her legs against her chest. She didn't mind if lightning struck her tree, she could simply absorb it and use it for her powers, seeing that it's always good to get a little boost in your powers.<br>

<br>
Oh!Great Goddess!<br>
Oh!Great Goddess arise!<br>
May your light<br>
Shine and strenghten us<br>
<br>
Oh!Great Goddess!<br>
Oh!Great Goddess arise!<br>
Your holy dawn<br>

Then, she returns at the hut she shares with Cyrena, her aunt and adoptive mother after twisting her long black hair to dry them, she takes a basket and goes in the forest to pick wild blackberries for her mother who likes them as it's her birthday.She looks at her daughter as she's quitting the hut.She ever had been her pride.Cyrena, who lost her only child, raised the orphaned Daphnike after her mother's death.Daphnike was blossoming into a magnificent young woman and Cyrena was pleased to say that she was more beautiful each day.And she was as spirited and lively as beautiful, of a proud, indomitable nature, just as Mytilene, her mother.Cyrena was thanking the Gods that Daphnike was still with her, after months ago, she past near death after being shot by a bandit.The 16 year old teenager grew up from her ordeals as a daiche and full growth woman and the impetuous,brash, reckless young Amazon took some wisdom, without losing her warrior spirit, going out of the path of vengeance that had once been her.In fact, it was at Lykastia that the young warrior changed, her path wasn't the one of an azran, she was a daiche, following a code of honor and never killing by cold blood, only for defense.<br>
<br>
And Cyrena was thinking that if Mytilene could see Daphnike, she'll be proud of her <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 470<br> <font color=#993300>(9/10/01 7:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=281.topic&index=16>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/hipprpg.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An end of summer storm</span><hr size=1> As the morning came, Hippolyte slipt out of the bed that now was being shared by her wife and her son.  Theseus didn't care for the storm and had crawled into the bed with his mothers.  The Vasilissa dressed in her typical purple and faded leathers, sliding her golden belt around her waist.  Grabbing an old Leather cape, she then took off for the LABRYS to find some red wine to warm her.  <br>
Placing a palm upon the outside of the LABRYS door, Hipp pushed the door open and wiped her feet on the threshhold.  She smiled seeing her athelfi as she stepped inside, "Yasoo!  How is everyone this rainy day?" <br>
Hipp smirked and shook her cloak off at the threshold and then placed it over a chair near the door.  Then shook her auburn hair that was now in long lose wet ringlets about her head.  <br>
She strode over to the bar and did a handspring over the counter.  A slight grin fell to her face as she whispered, "opah."  Then went to looking for a bottle of red wine. <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

Standing, she walked to the bar and fetched a bottle of warm cider. For once Dawn wasn't grabbing liqour or anything that she could get drunk off. Besides at that moment, she was happy being wet, and covered in blood. <br>
<br>
 Once she had the warm cider she settled down at a table, looping her fingers around the glass, taking a deep breath to smell the warm fumes. <p>

"Well, now that all seems to have settled down, I think it is time to celebrate the anniversary of our tribes reuniting (Four year anniversary.)  What do my athelfi think?"
