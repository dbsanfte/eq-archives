She cooled down when things now seemed to be settling,then looked to Mayth and padded over to the casket and jumped up,resting her front paws on the sides of the casket.

Instead we have alot of confused woman here...who are hurt and were in mourning,we could have spared the nation of its feelings for Queen Maytha if we had tried the ritual ahead of time. Now there is going to have to be some explaining to do for those who arent here,who still think Maytha is dead.&quot; Kala had gone from sad,mad,happy and now mad again. <br>
<br>
She looks to everyone gathered around. &quot;Everyone,as you can see, Queen Maytha is alive. There was some miscommunication and confusion about this whole thing. And now we welcome back our Queen,Maytha.&quot; Motions to Maytha. &quot;We can take this time to calm ourselves and collect our thoughts,but please try not to hound around Maytha,obviously she's just been through a huge thing.&quot; She finishes,then retreived her sword from the ground and sheathes it.<br>
<br>
She pats her leg lightly,and makes a calling noise for Crystal,who comes to Kala's side. Kala with her shadow walks over to a chair and sits down. She rests her head in her hands,collecting her own thoughts. <br>
<br>
Knowing someone you love and care for is dead causes much pain,then to see them alive the next moment can totally confuse the mind. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenmaytha.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Queen Maytha</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#8A2BE2>(1/27/02 1:16:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=131.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/amznqnmay/smallmaytha.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is in Shock</span><hr size=1> Alena sees Xena in the casket...&quot;Mommy!!&quot; she rushes over and practically jumps in the casket hugging may so tight.

Yakut crossed her arms over her chest. She was brought back by Cyane. Alysia was going to have Yakut born into a new body, but the Ancients decided otherwise and put Yakut back in her old body before the had even begun her funeral. Yakut was kinda getting tired of everyone dying and coming back to life. She shed tears for all these people then they popp up and say 'Hey I'm back.' Yakut just sighed. She loved her sisters but sometimes being a Northren shamaness could get a bit predictable.<br>
