He sat in a gilded chair, amongst the nine Muses. His wrist bobbed back and forth as he juggled a goblet of ambrosia, enjoying the nights festivities. He found it amazing how vanity and arrogance could turn the sweetest rose into a horrid weed. He saw a need to put an end to this, this was a wedding, not a beauty pagent.<br>
<br>
Apollo stood, and the Muses immediatly stepped aside. He cleared his throat and the room grew quiet. Apollo smiled warmly to the rest of the guests, glowling gently with his sun-like aura. He placed his goblet upon a marble table and walked over to Hera.<br>
<br>
&quot;My dearest step-mother. Few can match you sultry beauty, and undeniable sex appeal. You azure eyes burn like a cold flame, and your firey lips glow scarlet like a rare flower. You are indeed among the most pleasent looking females ever to grace Zeus's great universe.&quot; he smiled to his mother and glided across the room to his sister Athena.<br>
<br>
&quot;And Athena! The wise! The ravishing diamond in the rough! None can match you natural beauty. Your light orbs seem to weave a tapestry of brilliant colors and tickle the imaginations of mortal and deity. Your fare skin, light as snow, seemingly of a blank canvas just waiting for an artists hands to come and work upon. Dear daughter of Zeus, and Zeus alone, who could dare challenge your rare and insatiable beauty?&quot;<br>
<br>
He perked a bow and smirked, spinning slowly over to Aphrodite, his oversized sleeves spinning along with him. He grasped the hand of Aphrodite, looking fearlessly into the eyes of the great goddess of all things beautiful and lovely. He lifted his free hands to brush away the few hair that dare to cover her angelic face. <br>
<br>
&quot;All good and well things said about Hera, and Athena;&quot; saying their names he bowed his head to each of them accourdingly, the blushes upon their faces evident.<br>
<br>
&quot;I believe it pales in comparison to the breath taking, and quite frankly freakishly amazing beauty of Aphrodite. Patron goddess to all things beautiful! Besides Hepheastus, and Hermaphrodite all divinities are beautiful in their own right, but none can ever come close to the beauty that is Aphrodite herself. It is as if a power diviner than Zeus's himself, gathered all things wonderful and incarnated them into the fare goddess Aphrodite. Her hair, golden as my own, her eyes blue as Poseidon's seven seas. Skin farer than snow, and lips redder than the reddest apple.&quot;<br>
<br>
He slightly raised Aphrodite's hand and raised his own high in the air.<br>
<br>
&quot;Friends, family, mortals! Here before you lies the most beautiful female figure in the cosmos! As we speak you and I are being basked in her beauty, we are better for having seen her! Hera, Athena, all vanity put aside, you MUST admit that Aphrodite is the farest one of all. The Fates themselves gave her the title. She is goddess of beauty itself, and who better to know beauty than beauty itself! Hera, none are as cunning, Athena, no other is as wise, cultivated and learned as yourself, but all hands down Aphrodite is the most beautiful of all.&quot;<br>
<br>
Apollo shook the golden hair from his own azure eyes and smiled. He raised her hand to his soft lips and pressed it against them.<br>
<br>
&quot;No other in the land is as beautiful as what I hold before you. So might us continue this party, in peace, and in joy. Eris hand the golden apple to Aphrodite. And we shall continue in merriment this momentous occasion.&quot;<br>
<br>
Apollo released Aphrodite's hand and perked a brow, surely his speech would cause quite a stir. For affect, he kept his eyes off of Aphrodite, her expression was probably priceless, but nevertheless it would ruin the spontineity of the moment.<br>
<br>
Walking back to his seat, the Muses gasped and whispered among themselves. The pure gaul of Apollo to say such things, such...true things. Never did a untruthful word leave his mouth. They gathered around him, seemingly to protect him from the incomming onslaught.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugoddesseris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goddess Eris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/17/01 11:31:45 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/chaoticdiscordxx/images/eris1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The God of Truth Tells All</span><hr size=1> ::: She sat on the table, her legs swining in the air, the smirk on her lips, satisfied so far of her &quot; little game&quot; and where it was going.

Apollo lifted his hand as if to shush everyone around him. He shook the hair from his eyes and spoke, quietly so that only they could hear:<br>
<br>
&quot;I speak only the truth here tonight. If you think about the word fair...its of both beautiful of body, mind and soul. Now I love them all dearly, but c'mon, none of them are that &quot;fair&quot; to begin with. None of us are. I mean, Hera...psshh, when she goes on a vindictive streak, which by the way is like 5 miles long, she turns into a mad cow, plowing down everyone in her way. The only thing that gleams in her eyes is divine vengance. And being the god of JUSTIFIED Vengence, not that crazy stuff Nemisis is all about...&quot; he shakes his head with a smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;Anyway her revenge is rarely justified, or even fun to watch. Its often grotesque and down right mean. And Athena, being the goddess of wisdom she was done some pretty unwise things throughout the course of her life. Down right mean things. Like the whole squabble over Aphrodite trying to weave a tapestry. COME ON! She was just trying to make a tapestry, but Athena had run to Zeus, complaining Aphrodite was trying to steal her patronage.&quot; he rolled his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;And no Aphrodite is no angel. But most of the mean things she's done was either justified, or atleast with a little finess. She is so aloof she rarely holds a grudge, because if you ask me Zeus would be on MY hitlist if he hooked me up with...well you know.&quot; Apollo's lips curled in disgust as he turned and looked at poor, lame, Hephaestus. Sitting there in the corner, alone, again, sipping from his chipped goblet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now you could say Aphrodite is a little, well...she's premiscuous. But thats only because its her job. If someone gave you a license to flaunce around, flaunting all that you had. I bet you would. Everyone would. Its not &quot;right&quot;, but its justified. And EXCUSE ME, to all those people out there, talking about &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;beautiful&quot; not being the same. TAKE A LOOK AT A DICTIONARY. Its synonemous with beautiful, and the dictionary even goes as far as to say &quot;blonde&quot; rather than &quot;dark haired&quot;. &quot; At this point Apollo, shook the hair from his eyes, just for effect.<br>
<br>
&quot;It also says, the word fair, means...just. Which Hera really is not. She's only  just when her needs are being met. Which don't get me wrong, I'm just as vindictive as my dearest step-mother but I'm not the one in the beauty pagent. Fair means, pleasing to the eye, especially because of fresh,charming or flawless qualities. To the eyes, is not Aphrodite flawless? We're not judging character here, though that does factor in. I mean when you get right down to it fair means superficially pleasing. Which they all are, but if you want to talk perfection. Then look to Aphrodite.&quot;<br>
<br>
Apollo lifted his goblet to his mouth and sipped, to dampen his throat.<br>
<br>
&quot;They must not have been listening to me. I'm not saying that Dite is perfect. I'm just saying that if you want to talk fair, she is the fairest.&quot;<br>

Apollo quieted and began to drink from his goblet, taking a piece of baklava from a servant as he walked by offering o'erdourbs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/unikeqofv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NikeQofV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 110<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/18/01 1:03:51 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.btinternet.com/~dave.newton/lysette-anthony/pictures/lysette-anthony109.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> A good one</span><hr size=1> ::Nike looks on and smiles at Apollo's words.

They always managed to see eye to eye. He raised his goblet to his lips and sipped slowly, the conversation around him still buzzing. He basically laid it out for people, but he knew they would not listen. This little contest would bring about reprecussions that would be felt centuries from now. Apollo was sure of this, but what those reprecussion would be, his prophecies would not show him. All he knew was they were on the verge of something big.<br>
<br>
He knew that his little outburst would anger Artemis, she was so introverted sometimes. Day and Night they were, totally opposite but had the common ground of the sky. Apollo's outspokeness usually pierced more than a few nerves in Artemis, but those things HAD to be said. Apollo couldn't care anyless whose feelings got hurt, the feelings would heal. He had to speak the truth, what was on everyone's mind anyway. The only reason Athena and Hera are getting all worked up is because they aren't secure in their own beauty, neither is Aphrodite, they suffer the same insecurities most people do. And Eris, took advantage of this. This was her revenge for not being invited to this celebration of union.<br>
<br>
He admired Eris's craftiness, even it was used in a negative fashion, it was her job. And a job is a job. Apollo shook the golden hairs from his eyes. He raised his hands and made sure that his laurel was on and centered and proceeded to walk to the center of the room, standing upon a chair.<br>
<br>
He clapped a spoon against his goblet, again shushing everyone and smiled down to them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Enough of this foolishness. We act like children! Arguing over who is fairer than the next! For shame, it is an opprobrium the way you three act. But I understand why you do so. So I suggest we find a judge, as obviously I am a partial one. I suggest we find, a judge as impartial as one can get!&quot; he sips from his goblet.<br>
<br>
&quot;I say...we ask Zeus! Ofcourse the &quot;Savior Lord of The Sky&quot; will be a fine judge as to whether Aphrodite,Athena, or Hera is the fairest. Don't you all agree? My father, is always right is he not?&quot; with this a wicked smirk appears on Apollo's face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Perfect, then its decided, we will ask Zeus, and he will have the last word to this little squabble.&quot;<br>
<br>
Apollo stepped off the chair smiling devilishly. He had just placed his father in the hot-seat, and there was nothing he enjoyed more than throwing a kink in his fathers plans. He loved the man, but he was such a sucker. You know they saying, for every seer theres a sucker...well the line was drawn between seer Apollo and sucker Zeus. <br>
<br>
A small laugh escaped him as he almost skipped back to his side of the room, where a large amount of the guests were gathered by now. He smiled brightly and sat in his seat.<br>
<br>

It had only been moments since Eris made her appearance and already Hera and Athena were ready to tear Aphrodite to shreds. Sadly, Eris' plan had been working already.<br>
<br>
And even sadder, the others had gotten invollved.<br>
<br>
She glared at Apollo as he spoke his words about Hera, she smiled softly as he spoke of herself of course, but when he made his announcement about Aphrodite, her eyes narrowed into tiny slits glaring at the sun God.<br>
<br>
&quot;Apollo if I didn't love my sister Artemis so much . . .&quot;<br>
<br>
She was angered so greatly at that mere moment that she couldn't speak. Her eyes went wide as Nike agreed with him. Aphrodite would forever endure the wrath of Athena for this. Turning her own companion against her.<br>
<br>
She turned and looked lightly to Hera knowing that this must too be angering the Queen. But then the mention of Zeus was brought into play.<br>
<br>
She turned and faced her Father.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes Father, which of us is it indeed?&quot;<br>
<br>

Great Apollo......knowing the previous circumstances in our family line, it is best to stay out of this quarel and leave it to the three goddess.  We have seen all three be very vendictive in their special ways......<br>

He smirked and nodded slightly to Apollo.  &quot;See, even the wise Apollo knows when to cease with his own words and allow the King of the Gods to provide a solution to this quandry we have found ourselves in.&quot;  He was satisfied that he'd returned the favor to Apollo.  While the younger god was a beauty to the eyes, he still could not hold a flame to the King of the Olympians.<br>
<br>
Zeus had watched the young Paris eyeing Aphrodite.  &quot;I believe the simplest solution is that the young man there...&quot;  He pointed to Paris, &quot;Who is an objective and unbiased mortal male as this?&quot;  He pulled Paris to the center of the Olympians.  &quot;I believe this one will make a fine decision for us to settle this dispute once and for all.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=goddessathena>Goddess Athena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/18/01 11:21:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Zeus' Solution</span><hr size=1> Athena smiled linking her arm with her Fathers looking up at him with a daughters admiration.<br>
