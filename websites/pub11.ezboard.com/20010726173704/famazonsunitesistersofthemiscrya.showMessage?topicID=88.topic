Her body twisting in a deadly ballet around melons placed upon stakes. In a random path she would move in such swift, timed motions bringing the bladed end of her kama to slash through the melons. Deep within the forest's was she, practicing for her mentor had always told her 'practice makes perfect' and as her final action she would twist around before sending her kama to project in a rapid spiral aimed a good sixty feet away from where she stood at the last melon that had been placed on its stake so far away from the others. She stood and watched the Kama whirl its way toward its target before it suddenly came to a halt, stopping in mid air. Her forehead would wrinkle in confusion at this and through her eye's she could barely make out a shadowy figure. A step taken toward the Kama that froze in mid air and the figure would become clearer yet it still remained a shadow~........Who are you!!!! ~Azzepth would scream as she advanced toward the figure, and the closer she would come the cleaer the figure would appear to be a shadow. Bareing no distinkt shape or size as to who's shaodw it was, a shadow of a being that was not there but was, holding her Kama. Azzepth kept lurking toward the Shadow, her eye's narrowed in anger~ Give it back or meet your own Consequence............ ~The Shadow ignored her, and tossed the Kama upward into the air and just as it did it would lunge toward Azz in a lunging side kick, its foot slamming into her stomach sending her back and the Shadow would charge forth more, jumping as it would spin to the side in a whirling roundhouse, but Azz would duck under its foot and tumbling to the side to rise to her feet, the Shadow would land and Azz would lunge toward it in her own lunging side kick, but the shadow would duck and as it went to sweep Azz's leg she pushed back off it to flip backward and the two would continue there flurry of attacks against one another that only be dodged, forever it seemed to Azz although it was all happening so fast that the fight only lasted a few moments, before Azz was take advantage on one of the SHadows mistakes, but when her foot came forth to strike its chest her entire leg would go through it and the Shadow was no more, leaving a puzzled and tired Azzepth standing there breathing heavily, her body coated in a thing layer of sweat, and she would shout~ Coward!!!  ~She paused reaching up to wipe the sweat from her brow, and just then a blond brow would curl wondering where her kama had gone, and just then a 'thwick' echoed from behind her and the kama was there, it had fallen back from out the sky slicing down the melon, diceing the melon and the stake that held it into two, all the way down to the earth~  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uazzepthx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azzepth X</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://facelink.com/azzepth BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#993300>(12/21/00 6:14:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=88.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ~ Deathly Dicovery~</span><hr size=1> ~ The war was over now, and she was not satisfied at all with her performance in battle and so it was back to the northern forrest where she stood surrounded bye the tall growing trees, along with the many of various vegetation that grew there. Practicing with her kama's moving in her deadly ballet of kicks, thrusts, swinging her kama's. Going through kata after kata practicing until she found her own personal best within her practice, but while she went own covering herself in a thin coating of her own sweat that shadow that had posed as a threat would appear again walking out from between the tree's. This time the Shadow was not empty handed but held a short sword within its left hand so calmly making itself visible to Azz, whom at first sense of another presence paused in mid kata. Iced blue eye's would narrow at the familiar being and her stance would shift from mid kata to a crouched and ready stance of battle~<br>
<br>
&quot; You again aye......? I'm in no mood for games......so you had better finish what ever you start this time Shadow....&quot; <br>
<br>
~ The shadow showing its purpose went straight into a stance of battle itself, holding the short sword high above its head in its own crouched position, watching Azz as she watched him both waiting, anticipating that moment of attack. With in a flash of a second both gave in and lunged toward each other Azz dodging the Shadows thrusting strike spinning to the side but the Shadow would counter side stepping to avoid her kama's. The two would continue in a dance of attack's and counters, where one was not fast enough the other was, when it seemed as if one had the other they did not. So fast they would attack and defend, moving in such a fast pace systematic ballet of violence it was if it were a human chess game. Each possessing such skill, each of there moves flowing as if it were there first nature. There bought continued on for several minuets, before it was Azz that would succeed first in a under hook strike where she would drive the blade of her kama into the gut of the shadow. it stumbled back but would not lose its posture, the blade slipped out of it like its stomach was silk, no blood of sign of damage upon it. It was the shadows movement, its painful gestures that showed Azz had indeed effected it~<br>
<br>
&quot; So your not just a illusion.... you can be hurt....and if you can be hurt, then you can be killed!!! &quot; <br>
<br>
~ And Azz lunged forth, misjudging the shadow for she thought it was to injured to properly counter. Her assumption proving to be her flaw and the shadow came back to life with more strength then it had when they started, outmatching Azzepth's wits crouching low almost into a split then rising up to avoid her kama's and send its short sword straight into her stomach, piercing leather and flesh to cause a flood of crimson stream out from Azzepth's stomach.~<br>
<br>
&quot; Uhhhhhhh!!!! &quot;<br>
<br>
~ Azz was shocked at the sudden driving pain that remain in her stomach stunned yet on her feet, her kama's dropped and now both hands gripped the handle of the short sword that stuck within her. Her eye's open wide as her mouth was gasping at the sword that was stuck in her. The shadow however had dropped all signs of threat and would just stand there before her watching her. Azz looked up to the Shadow wide eyed with her jaw still dropped, then the shadow would make a small gesture, it wanted her to pull out the sword and at its request she did pulling the blade out from her stomach and as she did the strangest feeling she would feel as if her flesh was not pierced past her skin but only being pushed back bye the blade and the more she pulled it out the less pull she would feel. It was like the blade was pushing back against a thick texture that it could not pierce through and the more she pulled it from herself, her flesh would mold itself back to its original shape leaving a small slit in her skin that would prove to be not even a flesh wound. Astonished, scared, shocked, Azzepth felt this all now holding the short sword before her, her jaw no longer dropped nor were her eye's wide. She dropped the sword and started toward the shadow~<br>
<br>
&quot; You.....have you come to teach me.... have you come to help teach me of what I am......&quot; <br>
<br>
~ The Shadow shook its head no~<br>
<br>
&quot; Then what have you come for..... what are you....? why have you shown me this....what is the meaning of this....why is what would be a fatal wound nothing to me.....?&quot;<br>
<br>
~she grew angry as she spoke~<br>
<br>
&quot; What is the meaning of this.....speak or something.....tell me!!! show me more!!! I can't stand this....!!! &quot; <br>
<br>
~ The shadow then reached to its waist as if it were reaching for a item upon its belt and from there he would pull out a second short sword only this one had the most peculiar features. Its handle crafted of the finest art and the entire weapon had been molded out of the stone of Jade. How beautiful it looked it ints glimmering green self, not like any short sword Azz had seen for it was that shade of green all around. The shadow held it up for Azz to see as it tilted its head to the side like. Azzepth did not understand and would curl a blond brow at the weapon~<br>
<br>
&quot; And what is this......? &quot; <br>
<br>
~ So suddenly the shadow would move taking complete advantage of Azzepth's state of mind giving her no time to fall back into the state of battle she was just in, for she was curious, and almost lost her thoughts completely of the questions that she has no answer to. The shadow swiftly brought the Jade short sword back and would drive it straight back into Azzepth's stomach where she had just pulled the other short sword from. Azzepth was breathless, her eye's wide, and her jaw dropped. The pain that this sword would cause was incredible infact it was more then she could bare. Her flesh would not do as it did to the other, she felt this sword pierced past her flesh into her stomach. Numb she felt, so much pain as her life rushed out of her in a dark flood of crimson. To her knee's first and then to her side she fell and like the first time she would reach up and grip the handle. When she did a new discovery, the flesh at the underside of her hands stung with a wicked burning sensation just as the wound that she had just obtained did. She lay there on the floor of the northern forest now her life gushing out of her, yet the more agonizing torment that plagued Azz were these two new questions. The shadow looked down and from where any other being would have eye's two slanted, slender blood reed orbs would appear and the shadow would speak in a low, icy, erie tone. Hat would pierce through Azzepth's thoughts and terror through her mind~<br>
<br>
&quot; You want a answer....but what good would it do you know....? your life is moments away from its end.... and sense I am in the more generous mood I will give you your answer....any normal weapon...any attack will not harm you as much as it would a mortal, or any that does not poses your divine influence ...but if the Jade....the stone of gods has any influence ....it will effect you greater then it would any other....from the simplest decoration of a ring with a jade stone upon its center... to a sword with a jaded handle. You cannot even touch it for it will burn your flesh, when it is used against you...you are almost powerless.... and this that I have impaled you with...this artifact, this relic... the short sword of jade....is that much more powerful....and because of this....I say to you know....good bye...angel of vengeance ....may you never rest in peace....&quot; <br>
<br>
~ With that the shadow would materialize into nothing, fade away as easy as the wind blows. Leaving Azzepth to die upon the forrest floor~  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ucallistoblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CallistoBlade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Goddess</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#993300>(12/21/00 7:00:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=88.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ~Walk through the woods to be alone~</span><hr size=1> ::Quietly walking through the woods,she looks around knowing no one is around to watch her,a soft smile upon her crimson lips as she walks looking at the forest and all its beauty,she takes in a deep breath and looks to the sky::<br>

In strange surroundings not even remembering how she had got there. Had she blacked out....? was she even awake...? her body felt completely numb, infact she could not even feel. Her blood spilling out from her wound to soak over her skin, drenching her white leather as it would begin to paint its dark crimson over the sheets of the bed. The Short sword of Jade still sticking out from her stomach. She lay there with her eye's wide open and anyone that would look into them could see the essence of her life slowly being drained from them, being swallowed bye death. She could feel nothing around her, not the temperature of the hut, nor could she feel the surface she laid upon, everything was numb, like her body had turned itself off. WIthin her thoughts were nothing but confusion ' where am I....? how did I get here....? who was talking to me.....? what am I doing....? am I dead....? am I alive....?' Her thoughts of confusion would soon fade into a comfortable and erie silence. Something that a dreamless sleep would bring only more defined in its darkness, in its silence. Then she saw something, she herd someone, she felt something as if her sense of touch had been suddenly brought back, and she found herself in her old room. The very same room that was hers at the age of three, she blinked at first not understanding why she was suddenly in the past. Then again she did not blink, she did but the Azzepth that lay upon her bed back in her old room did not, she was now looking through the eye's of a memory. Then the memory moved, it would rise up from her bed and walk over toward the door opening it and stepping into the hall way, and walk down along it toward the living room of the house where she herd shouting. She herd the voice's of her mother and father arguing over something.~<br>
<br>
&quot; She is your daughter!!! she is your flesh and blood you must reconsider this....&quot;<br>
<br>
~ She herd her mother beg to her father, and there she would freeze and the sense of fear stung her whole causing her to remain there in silence and listen. She dare not to make her presence aware, and then she herd her father retort against her mother in that arrogant tone that she could not stand to remember~<br>
<br>
&quot; I disown that....that....thing....that weak and lesser being that you so adoringly named Azzepth!!!! and if you wont this weak and worthless child so much...then perhaps I should send you with her.....&quot; <br>
<br>
~ her father threatend~<br>
<br>
&quot; No!!!!! how can you say such a thing to me!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
~ There was great fear in her mothers tone and she could feel it in her words~<br>
<br>
&quot; Because I can.... If you refuse to stand bye my decision to rid our family of this little pest, then perhaps you are not worth the trouble just as she is.... infact I am starting to like this idea already, one can only the imagine the prophet I could make on the two of you together....or maybe just maybe....you to are not even worth to trade for riches...maybe I should throw you and the little waste of flesh back out on the streets where I found you.... tell me.... would you sell your body to feed your starving little girl.....? what ever would you do with out me......? what would you do without the wealth I provide...? where would you go for shelter....? what would you dress yourself in.....? certainly not the fine silks I waste my precious gold on for you....perhaps raggs....would suit you better....?&quot;<br>
<br>
~ Azzepth could hear her mother breaking down into tears at her father's threats, and her voice was shaken with her sobs when she spoke again~<br>
<br>
&quot; How could you....how could you....even imagine these things....how an you stand there and make threats like that to me, to your wife...?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; Because I own you, and without me you are nothing, and if you were wise you would shut your mouth, and stand bye me in my decision.....so what will it be....? &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; Fine......do it.....but before you trade her away.....let me say good bye to her....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; There now...that was not hard now was it.....?&quot;<br>
<br>
~ Stuck between anger, pain, and self pity Azzepth was not able to hear the foot steps of her father as he began toward the same hallway that she was, then just as simple as a wink it was back to blackness no longer was she within her old home but somewhere between life and death, her body numb, her thoughts fading She new it was coming she new that she was about to black out into unconsciousness again. She did not want to, but could not fight it, and the harder she tried the more difficult it became~  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugabby0209.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gabby0209</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#993300>(12/21/00 10:54:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=88.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ~Home at the hut~</span><hr size=1> ::a quick nod was given to callisto and she sighed gently as she left..it seemed like ages sine they'd been together..and come to find out when she made her way back to the village it was at war..she had just come from peace talks about another problem with lands she and her legions held control of:: War...<br>

Even though her body lay there she could see from where she stood just inches away from it. She glanced from Gabby to Calisto as they spoke, but there words Azzepth could not make out for they were to silent to her ears. All she could do was watch and depend on her ability to read there gestures. She saw that they seemed happy, maybe even in love from there eye's and the chemistry between them. She did not understand however why she could see her body laying lifelessly upon a bed as other's carried on happily so it seemed. Was she dead...? she thought to herself, but when she looked to her body upon the bed she could see her chest as it fought to move up and down struggling for each breath. How could this be she thought, what state of being is this...? and then something came to answer her questions. The same voice of the shadow would enter her thoughts, piercing through her mind with its wicked and erie tone.::<br>
<br>
&quot; Funny isn't it....here you are somewhere between life and death, and they seem so happy.....no one seems to care much if you live or die....no one noticed when you dissapeared....maybe you should for good....maybe you should leave this life....&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot; Who are you.....what did you do to me....? &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; I tried to kill you...its as simple as that...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; Tried.....  but you fail.... I'm still alive...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; your breathing in there....yes you are still physically alive but barely....you can return to yourself and live, but what would that be worth....? just look around you, they don't care.....there you lay and there they love each other...your well being a minor concern...and if the tables were turned and it was one of them on that bed just think of how concerned they would be, how conserned you would be... the scale does not balance does it.... so..ask yourself...is it worth going back.....?&quot;<br>
<br>
:: Azzepth looked as the voice narrated her eye's showing the bit of self pity that she felt when seeing the truth in what the voice said. When her eye's traveled back to her body they would narrow::<br>
<br>
&quot; It is worth going back.....It is there right to act that way, and if the table's were turned it would be there right to act the way you describe, they love one another, they are sacred to one another as they are sacred to me just as any Sister of Themiscrya is.....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; Of course they are to you....but are you to they....? &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; I am, you are a fool to ask that &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; and how do you know that you are....what proof do you have....? it does not seem at all that they care much for you, after all there you are...dyeing with each kiss they give one another and all they can do about it is speak of how they hope that you will be ok....not want....perhaps they hope that you live, perhaps they hope you don't. Hope can be a double sided sword if you look at it the right way... in a Sissy foot kind of light...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; Are you trying to make me choose death......convince me that my life here is meaningless, that no one cares if I live or die....that I am ...... ~ Her angelic features would fall into sadness~ worthless.....?&quot;<br>
<br>
:: The knocking upon the door broke her sadness and once she set eye's upon Hipp her features would light up, watching each of three, yet no words were understood there tone's only faint whispers and once again she would rely on that reading of gesture's. She watched Hipp's lips move, she watched her actions and when Hipp begin to speak holding the candle Azzepth would be able to hear. She listened to every last bit and the more Hipp said the louder and clearer her words came, and as her sense of hearing returned so would the essence of life within her eye's upon her body that lay on the bed. The scale of life and death was no longer in deaths favor and everything that looked lifeless in her was slowly bringing brought back and when Hipp, Azzepth's body would move, a slight tensing of the muscles was all, then her eye's would flicker upon her body, and the Azzepth that stood inches from it would merge back within the body that lay upon the bed to remain asleep. A sleep that would last all of a moment, because as soone as she settled back into life a high pitched sting rang out from where the wound was and her eye's would open wide as he body sprung up into life~<br>
<br>
&quot; Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
~ She screamed at the pain coming from her stomach, just as the one that scorched the under side of her hands, falling back down unto the bed to, curling up into a fetal position with her teeth clenched tightly growling. Trying to consintrate, take her mind off the pain, ignor it as she was taught. The harder she tried the worse the sting would grow until it reached a limit. She lay there suffering within the grasps of such a high-pitched agonizing sting until she grew semi used to it. Opening her eye's to take in her surroundings, she twitched from the pain while trying to sit up. Setting her eye's toward Gabby and Calisto gritting her teeth~  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ucallistoblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CallistoBlade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Goddess</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#993300>(12/24/00 6:49:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=88.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ~Shocked~</span><hr size=1> ::She looks to Azzepth and Smiles::<br>
