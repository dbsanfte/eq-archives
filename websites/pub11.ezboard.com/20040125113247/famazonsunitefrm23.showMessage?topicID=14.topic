The view from where she stood was perfect for watching over her charges, mainly half god children, and women. At her side, her loyal companion, Kessara, sat, her ears lifted as she listened to the world below. The beautiful goddess and protector of wolves, was sulking again, after a heated arguement with Ayla. &quot;Don't be such a cub,&quot; Ayla said, deliberately baiting her. <br>
    Kessara sniffed. &lt;&lt;I am not speaking to you Ayla. And I am not a cub.&gt;&gt;<br>
    Ayla smiled. &quot;Oh come on, you are not still mad at me are you?&quot; Kessara didn't answer. *Guess so,* Ayla thought. &quot;I don't understand why this obsession with my speaking to the divine family is so important.&quot;<br>
    &lt;&lt;You must speak to the gods. She is not going to bite you,&gt;&gt; Kessara stated, baring her teeth in a vicious grin,&lt;&lt;but I might.&gt;&gt; <br>
    &quot;I told you Kessara, I can't.&quot;<br>
    &lt;&lt;Why not?&gt;&gt;<br>
    Ayla took several seconds to reply. *Because they have the answer to a secret. A secret that could bring me shame and death, or bring me happiness. But it is too big a risk.* &quot;Maybe someday soon,&quot; she said instead. Kessara seemed content for a moment. Ayla pretended to watch the mortals below, but her mind wandered back to her first memories. <br>
    -*-It was so cold. A young girl sat up from the altar she lay on. Her intense blue eyes examined the temple. It was so dark. She could see statues of a woman all over the temple, but the face was always covered in shadows. The girl was no older then six, with wavy brown hair to her waist, and pale skin. She was clothed from head to foot in green and gold silk, with a large necklace of a single sky blue diamond in the middle around her neck, looped twice because of it's length. *Who am I?* she thought. *Ayla.* She said the name aloud, trying it on her lips, to see if it fit. The front entrance of the temple burst open and men in uniforms filed in. Four women came out of a side door, saw the men and screamed. One of the men grabbed one of the woman and put a sword through her, but she continued to scream, loud ear spliting screams. The others ran from the room.<br>
    Ayla put her small hands over her ears. The men noticed her for the first time. A man in a command uniform walked toward the altar slowly, while Ayla watched him approach, her eyes wide with fear. When he reached her, he glanced up at the giant statue behind her and smiled. &quot;Who are you child?&quot; he asked.<br>
    Ayla stared at him fearfully. &quot;Ayla,&quot; she whispered. <br>
    &quot;Where is your family?&quot; he asked.<br>
    &quot;I don't have any.&quot;<br>
    The man turned to the dying woman. &quot;Who's child is this?&quot;<br>
    The woman lay on the floor, blood all around her, but she answered clearly. &quot;She is her daughter,&quot; she cried, pointing to the huge statue. The man smiled. &quot;An abandoned child of Greece. Now you are a child of Rome,&quot; his face twisted viciously, and he grabbed Ayla. <br>
    Years past and Ayla grew up in a Roman outpost in Greece. Her adopted mother, Juliana was a frail and gentle woman, with an abusive husband. Constantly, she provoked him into beating her, to protect Ayla from his many violent beatings. One day, Ayla had finished her chores and her adopted father returned home from raiding a small villiage, when his temper turned to Ayla, for no reason at all. He began to beat her and Juliana threw herself onto Ayla, which enraged her husband further. Juliana was beaten to death. After her funeral, Ayla confronted her father, who attempted to beat her, when an enraged Ayla killed him, with nothing but her mind. With her blue eyes blazing, she watched him engulfed in flames.<br>
    She left the outpost and headed to Athens. There she met a seer, who told her something she has never forgotten. &quot;You are the daughter a god and goddess of Greece.&quot; That night an unfamiliar deity visited her in her dreams. She was given back her immortality for a price. From then on she had worked as an assasin for the gods, never meeting them, for she recieved their orders by Hermes. But she always remembered her secret, and never wished to speak to the gods, for fear that she would find what she was looking for...and find she wasn't wanted.-*-<br>
    Ayla blinked out of her thoughts of the past. She was a protector now. She frowned as she realized she was fingering the sky blue diamond around her neck. Then she heard it.<br>
    Footsteps could be heard heading toward her. It could only be one of the gods. She knew they would ask the inevitable question: Who was she? And that was an answer she didn't know. The footsteps came closer and it was to late to leave. She turned and nervously waited for the immortal to appear before her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> XVDionysus</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FFFF33>(3/5/01 2:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The god of Wine and Revelry</span><hr size=1> :: He walks down a hallway in his home reading a book, but as he reads he thinks to himself.

She prayed to the mother goddess, Gaia, that he would not see her. Praying was a habit she had when she was mortal, and even now, she could seem to break it. She knew her prayers were in vain. The god continued to stare at her. Ayla nudged an unknowing Kessara, who looked up to the palace, and her wolf body froze. &lt;&lt;Oh no. Let's go now, before he decides to come to us.&gt;&gt;<br>
    Ayla hesitated for a few moments. The truth about her past was in  her grasp, but dare she take it? She knew that if she found out the truth, and it was that she was truly abandoned as a god child, because she was unwanted, she couldn't live with it. Worse yet, what if her birth was a shame on the royal house of Olympus? No. She could not risk hurting the gods. <br>
    She gave Dionysus a formal bow, then disappeared in a flash of blue light, while Kessara stayed behind for a moment longer. She looked up at the wine god and nodded in acknowledgement. Then she two was gone, in a flash of gold.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> GuardianAyla</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FFFF33>(3/6/01 10:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Safe Haven</span><hr size=1> Ayla sat on a stump in the middle of a forest clearing. A young girl ran, giggling, with a wolf chasing her. Ayla's blue eyes twinkled in amusement. The girl raced into Ayla's arms and turned to the wolf, sticking her tongue out. &lt;&lt;Now Rheia, what have I told you about manners?&gt;&gt; Kessara asked, sitting back on her hind legs. Rheia, a beautiful child, with long black hair, and hazel-gold eyes, grinned happily. &quot;Nothing,&quot; she said. Ayla opened her mouth to speak, but only watched in amusement, as Aiania, Thaleia, and Kreon attacked a surprised Kessara from behind. She watched her four primary charges with a content feeling. These children, all half gods, had lost their mortal parents and had no one, while her other charges had families. Ayla took them under her wing. Aiania, with her golden hair and blue eyes, Thaleia with her chesnut hair and chocolate brown eyes, and Kreon, the only boy in the group, with jet black hair and smoky grey eyes were her children now.<br>
   <br>
Ayla listened to their happy laughter and lay on the soft earth. She remembered the instance on Olympus, when she had almost been known, but she didn't dwell on it now. She just lay back, listening to the world around her, her guard down, as she relaxed and smiled.<br>

Alecto, Megaera, and Tisiphone. The Furies.<br>
<br>
They glanced over to the scene and smiled lightly, smiling as best they could being bringers of insanity and death. But they wanted to know more about this . . Goddess.<br>
<br>
A few of the half-gods looked around sensing something there, but their mortal sides kept the Furies images hidden to their eyes. Like it has been said. . .only another immortal can view an immortal without permission.<br>
<br>
Alecto grinned and stood over Ayla.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have been watching you for sometime Goddess.&quot;<br>
<br>
Megaera grinned and stood in front of her.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have brought great interest to Olympus child.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ayla was not a child. . .however to them, even Hera was a young one. Their niece to be exact.<br>
<br>
Tisiphone looked over Ayla smiling lightly.<br>
<br>
Megaera spoke, &quot;Tisiphone can't talk you know. Her meer voice can only be withstood by another Furie. The sound of it brings pure insanity to those who are close enough to hear.&quot;<br>
She grinned wickedly.<br>
<br>
Alecto stepped in front of the other two.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mind not my sister Megaera. She lacks patience with strangers, and intelect with her own.&quot;<br>
<br>
Megaera hissed at Alecto and stood down.<br>
<br>
Alecto turned back to Ayla.<br>
<br>
&quot;We saw you young Goddess. We saw you leave the pressence of Dionysus.&quot;<br>
<br>
Alecto stepped closer to her studying the young one. <br>
<br>
&quot;I see a bit of fear in your eyes. Many mortals fear us yes, but No God or Goddess is feared by uis unless they have something to hide.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tisiphone looked into Ayla's eyes then rushed over to Megaera whispering in her ear.<br>
<br>
Megaera almost fell to the ground with laughter then looked up at Alecto and Ayla.<br>
<br>
&quot;Our new friend has a secret.&quot;<br>
<br>
Alecto sighed and asked calmly as best she could.<br>
<br>
&quot;And what is this secret sister?&quot; To Megaera.<br>
<br>
Megaera grinned. &quot;Tisiphone knows. . .Tisiphone knows all young Goddess.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tisiphone smiled softly to herself as she watched her elder sister roll over the ground in insane laughter.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sister.&quot; Alecto said to Tisiphone. &quot;What is this secret?&quot;<br>
<br>
Tisiphone smiled at Ayla and then vanished in a whirl of black flames.<br>
<br>
Alecto smirked and turned back to Ayla.<br>
<br>
&quot;Trust in the sister Furie to keep your secret young one. For no God would hear Tisiphone speak it on their own will.&quot;<br>
<br>
Megaera stood and calmed down a bit looking to Ayla.<br>
<br>
