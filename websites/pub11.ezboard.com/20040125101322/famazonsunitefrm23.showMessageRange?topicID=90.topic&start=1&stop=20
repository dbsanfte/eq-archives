Megaera was the best out of the trio, she had just come from another meeting with Bellerophon. Tisiphone was still a little pissed at the Victory Goddess and without Mojo around to talk to, she kept her anger inside.<br>
<br>
Alecto had just come back from Ares Temple after a little meeting with the other Gods where yet another male had fallen for the Goddess of Love.<br>
&quot;How typical.&quot; She growled lightly.<br>
<br>
Megaera sighed.<br>
&quot;Yeah well get over it. You could have almost any dark God on Olympus.&quot;<br>

His midnight blue toga ruffeled about, with all of his trimmings in gold. His crystal blue eyes wandered around the temple. He noticed many priests and what not running about preparing things. They all stopped and hit the floors as Apollo made his presence known by caughing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please...stand.&quot; he doesn't even make eye contact with them, and with a roll of his wrist he dismisses them. 'I grow so tiresome of all these airhead mortals dropping to the floor everytime I show up.' he thought to himself. He made his way through the hallways and corridors until he found the room where the Furies were retiring.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good evening ladies.&quot; he said with his dazzaling smile. His eyes bounced from goddess to goddess until he found Alecto, who looked rather purturbed. 'Just as I thought, Ares has got another victem.' he says to himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Umm, I saw that little...::he pauses::...display made by my brother. I  wish to apologize for him as I know that he himself would never do as such. I just came over, as I was making my way to my temple in the eastern sky which is on the way, to make sure that you were ok, which you are obviously not.&quot; Apollo, very bluntly sat down next to her, shaking the hair from his eyes. He sat back resting his weight on his arms.<br>

Tisiphone nodded and stood looking to her sister.<br>
As Megaera passed Apollo she whispered, &quot;Never touch a burning flame.&quot;<br>
Speaking of her sister's anger of course.<br>
<br>
Seeing that her sister's had left her there, Alecto stormed back to her throne and sat herself upon it. She looked at Apollo as if hiding something. &quot;I am fine Apollo, Ares and I have a certain relationship.

<br>
&quot;I understand that one must get one's...&quot;kicks&quot; as you call it. But with Ares? Of all the divinities upon Olympus? C'mon Alecto, you can do better without trying! Ares such a, such a, bohemith! To do anything of meaning with him is simply opprobrius! Yes I make, mistakes of such kind, but I would never...::he eyes show that he is searching for the word::...lower, or demean myself by doing it with such a unit. If you know what I am talking about.&quot; He shrieks, and shudders as he even gives it a thought.<br>
<br>
He walks over to a table, and pours himself a glass of nectar. He sips it and looks up at Alecto, shaking the hair from his sparkling eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;When your getting your ::he hesitates, not liking the choice of words:: &quot;kicks&quot; with Ares, you are surely imagining yourself with someone else, verdad? Am I correct? One would surely hope so.

No, no one ever spoke with Megaera about Cupid or Dionysus.<br>
<br>
She sighed.<br>
&quot;Well Apollo, you would be able to say that. But I as a Furie am not. For you see, when all the other male Gods are flaunting themselves over Dite, Artemis and Persephone, I am here having to settle for Gods like Ares.&quot; <br>

Decides not to mention the mortals.<br>

&quot;The great Apollo does not FLAUNT...do I?&quot; he said, or rather asked. A bit of question was in his eye. He knew that he showed himself off, but did he fault around like perhaps his father? 'Ofcourse not Apollo, you are nothing like your father!' he thought to himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;And I was just asking about who you imagined, I was making conversation. Because you know who I have a thing for I was just trying to take a peek into Alecto's world.

&quot;And anyway, Aphrodite does not even share the same bed as Hephaestus. And I doubt that they have had sex before. And Aunt Hera loves Zeus with all of her heart.

&quot;Ugh!&quot; he said as he walked off trying to retain his dignity. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/utheerinyes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Erinyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(6/28/01 1:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=90.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Closing. . </span><hr size=1> Alecto threw her hands up and the doors shut before Apollo had a chance to leave.

&quot;Why do you care?&quot; She muttered softly.<br>

He looked over to her his eyes shimmering in the moonlight, his hair swayed as a breeze ran through the temple. In that instant if he was not a god, he would of certainly looked like one, if he was not already blindingly beautiful, he would be...in that instant. It was perhaps when he was at work ain his &quot;people skills&quot; that he looked his best. And he was certainly working hard at breaking Alecto open so that he may reap the fruits of his effort.<br>
<br>
&quot;So please, if you are not going to talk. Let me go, I will go be with my sister or someone. Anyone who will talk, willingly.&quot; his face was filled with empathy, the golden god shone in every aspect of the word. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/utheerinyes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Erinyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 83<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(6/28/01 2:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=90.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Letting go of bitterness. . .</span><hr size=1> Alecto sighed hearing this.

<br>
&quot;Come back in Apollo, we can talk.&quot;<br>
<br>
She lowered her head wondering why she was giving into him. She had never done that before.<br>

He smiled, with his smile that could turn the world on its side. His smile seemed to illuminate the night. He shook the hair from his eyes and followed Alecto back into her throne room. His sandles clapping against the marble floor as he goes. He couldnt help but wonder what made her change her mind.<br>
<br>
He tossed his hair again as he took a seat on the floor. This gave a hint to how young at heart he actually was, how innocent he was. Here he is in a room full of elaborate sofas and what not and he chooses to sit on the floor. He folds his legs indian style.<br>
