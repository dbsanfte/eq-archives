She knew it was comming. The end of the Cenataur war where everything would be let loose. Yet at the same moment she loved it. For the first time in her life she was someone of importance. And Hippolyte trusted her to bring down the army towards the Eastern Forest and wipe the Centaurs out. Aly was planning to do that...<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Amazons! Attack!&quot; Aly shouted as she raised her sword and gently kicked her horse in the sides as the Scynthian Army as well as those from Themiscrya galloped down towards the trees. The Scynthian armies were wearing wolf skins and their masks, as well as Centaur blood to stripe their arms and faces. The Centaurs hated that. And it made them afraid when the amazons charged into the forest right at them. She smiled to Hippolyte who was on the other side, as she took her sword and struck it through the heart of a Centaur, while taking her crossbow and shooting three oncomming centaurs in the neck making them convulse and fall to the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do not retreat until everylast drop of Centaur blood is on your hands amazons!&quot;<br>

She was a warrior, a warrior queen who was determined to win. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uaeacuswolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aeacus Wolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#993300>(12/14/00 5:27:44 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ··~§*·Centaur War·*§~·· The Eastern Forest</span><hr size=1> <img src=http://members.aol.com/heraqofgsmo/aeacus.jpg ><br>
The large male wolf bound behind his Queen.  His eyes already spotting a Centaur for his kill.  Loyal to his Queen Alysia, he had fought against the Centaurs when they attacked Scynthia.  But, during the battle they had killed his mate.  This made the war even more emotional for the wolf.  As he came upon the Centaur he lept into the air, his teeth sinking into the Centaur's neck.  The centaur began to beat at the wolf with the back of his axe handle.  But, Aeacus refused to let go.  He snarled, and his paws pushed against the chest of the Centaur.  He shook his head from side to side, until the sawing action ripped the skin and tissue from the Centaurs neck.  Aeacus fell to the ground with the flesh in his teeth.  The Centaur grabbed his neck grabbed at his neck gasping and then fell as an amazon rode by and struck him to his death.  Aeacus quickly spun around to see who to attack next. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uaeacuswolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aeacus Wolf</A> at: 12/15/00 7:11:54 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uaeacuswolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aeacus Wolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#993300>(12/15/00 7:04:14 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ··~§*·Centaur War·*§~·· The Eastern Forest</span><hr size=1> Aeacus lept back into action, finding a Centaur fighting a lone amazon.  He growled and pounced upon the side of the centaur.  His teeth digging in deeply to the flesh.  The Centaur yelled and kicked the wolf off, throwing him several feet away.  The large wolf scrambled to his feet again and lept this time to the softer under belly of the centaur.  The centaur reared up, making Aeacus fly up with him.  The centaur again kicked him off and then fell back to his feet.  As he did the amazon sliced into his chest and he fell with a thud.  <br>
Aeacus rose again, now feeling a bit bruised.  But, not stopping until Queen Alysia called off the attack.  He rushed towards a Centaur who was running towards Queen Alysia who was already in a fight with another Centaur.  He ran at top speed towards the centaur.  Then lept into the air, flying at the neck of the Centaur from the side. Teeth dug into flesh and the Centaur grabbed and tried to pull the wolf off.  But, Aeacus only dug his teeth in deeper.  The Centaur began to beat the sides of the wolf.  This hurt the wolf, as it beat his bruised sides.  He let go from his bite and dropped to the ground.  The Centaur relieved of the wolf, turned and ran away.  Aeacus panted, his lips almost in a smile at watching the larger beast run from his attack. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> jetisgalladro</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(12/15/00 5:04:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> :::she walked into the parts of the forest::</span><hr size=1> ::she was like a human scythe, her fans cutting down what ever came near her, :::<br>

Aeacus lowered his head slowely stalking the Centaurs who began to back off.  Then with a lunge and a loud barking growl, all the wolves descended upon the Centaurs who were in the Eastern parts of the forest.  Eventually, the wolf pack killed all but those who ran away.  After feeling that the eastside had been won, he tilted his head up and sent the message of the win to Queen Alysia in a long howl. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=scynthianwolf>Scynthian Wolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wolf</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#993300>(12/18/00 11:42:03 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Here he comes a runnin</span><hr size=1> Scythe ran all the way from the healing hut towards the Eastern forest when he heard the howl of victory..
