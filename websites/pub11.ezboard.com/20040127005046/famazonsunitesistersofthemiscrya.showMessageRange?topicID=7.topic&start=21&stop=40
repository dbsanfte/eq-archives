See if they are in need of shoes and check their bridles and saddles.  &lt;vsw&gt;  I will appreciate it Danny.<br>

::Justine led them up the stairs to there rooms and made sure they had everything they needed.  She went back down giving the barmaid instructions to bring them a soft wine and some cheese and bread, a tray of fruits.  Then, having finished doing what she could to make their stay comfortable, she set off to her home to prepare for their visit.:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://hometown.aol.com/queenhippolyte/BC.html BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(7/30/00 2:52 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Warriors in a room of lace</span><hr size=1> :::Hippolyte glanced about the inn room she had been taken to.  Except for the scruffy sailors, everyone here seemed to have extreme manners.  Such curtisy that she had never ever come upon.  Especially of the men.  The blacksmith, Donny, had been so nice.  He had taken the amazon's weapons to clean them up.  And was also to look at the warrior's horse's shoes.  Hippolyte touched her harpi talon daggers at her side.  She had kept those.  Tho everyone seemed so nice, a warrior is not without a weapon.  Besides, a blacksmith could do nothing for talon blades, that are not made of a metal.  The first thing to catch her eyes, was the rather large white lace bed in her room.  As beautiful as it was, Hippolyte was afraid to touch it.  She didnt want to get it dirty.  So, she laid her leather saddle bag in a chair of burgandy velvet, hoping any dirt would not show upon it.  The brunette amazon found a basin of water and then stripped of her road garb.  She washed off her tan skin with a burgandy cloth and the water from the basin.   And then washed off her boots with the slightly damp cloth. Then looked thru her bags.  She found a clean silk purple chamise and slid it over her small, but strong frame.  She then grabbed her golden belt and smiled at it.  It was the precious gift given to her from her father, Ares.  She then fastened it around her waist.  She never parted with that precious gift.  Then her hands pulled out her long burgandy Queen's robe and put it on.  Pushing her bags off the chair, she pulled her boots back on.  She picked her bag up and found the golden comb that Ahprodite had given her.  Then she went to the mirror beside the water basin.  Her strong hands pulled the comb thru her wild and careless auburn hair.  When finished she looked herself over and smiled.  Nowing that no matter how clean she was.. she would still be that wild amazon from far away.. she smirked proudly.  And then looked to the door.. wondering how Sethra was doing:::: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Sethra</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(7/31/00 7:56 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Inn</span><hr size=1> :: Sehtra, apon intering the room, found the basin and cleaned herself. She put fresh clothes on and washed the other ones and hung them to dry over the basin. She still had a knife with her but felt weird and untrusting letting a man sharpen her sword. She didn't like to be with out it.<br>
 She noticed a beautiful bed and pillow and immediatly went to it. She laid on the bed, enjoying the softness. Much better than sleeping on tree roots and damp soil.<br>
 She thought about everthing that has happened and then thought about what was to happen later. She noticed a window on the wall and got up to look out. It was a very pretty view. It over looked the the whole Isle. The sky was turning a bright purple,evening was approaching. A few birds flew in the air.<br>
 She went back to the bed and decided to take a quick nap, she was very tired from the journey.:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://hometown.aol.com/queenhippolyte/BC.html BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(7/31/00 1:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> warrior in a world far from home</span><hr size=1> :::the amazon queen walked out the door, passing Sethra's room and down the stairs of the inn.  She had decided to give the tired warrior a break.  Stepping out of the inn.. her brown eyes looked about the calming street that night had begun to touch.  She watches as a street light man came by and lit the lamps.  She watched in almost fascinated as he calmly walked along the street lighting the candles in the little glass houseing.  Then the sound of horses pulled her eyes from the silent man.  She turned and walked down to the smithy's barn. The warrior woman catching the odd glance from the inhabitants of the town. As she turned and pushed open the barn door ..she smiled to see Monsoon looking up at her.  Seening the grey mare's big eyes and soft muzzle made Hippolyte feel a little bit of home.

The horses were tired, but strong and well-cared for. He fed and watered them, then dressed their hooves , giving them careful inspection. They'd travelled a long way, but without injury. The blades were much the same; having seen some miles, by the slight telltale  nicks and scratches, but sharper than any he'd care to meet in battle. He chuckled, surmising from these conditions, that the ladies were probably not at ease without their swords within reach. He polished out the scratches, lightly oiled the blades, then gathered them up to return just as the queen entered. She moved with a stealthy grace, her well-muscled form not at all disguised by the royal purple silks, as she moved toward her horse. He couldn't help but stop and admire the goldwork that belted her narrow waist as she reached to embrace the horse, who greeted her with enthusiasm. With a rustle of the weaponry in his arms,<br>
he stepped into the beam of light streaming in through the large side doors that led out from the small stables, catching an almost wild look in her dark brown eyes as she turned::<br>

Sometimes her duties overwhelmed her.  <br>
Justine went into the town very early the next morning.  She went to the market and purchased the finest fruits she could find. She also purchased a basket to place them in. There was a lot to choose from since Capt Merlobo had returned with his fleet.<br>
She went home and walked about her garden picking the finest flowers there.  Going into the kitchen, she arranged the basket of fruits and flowers into an array. Going to her desk, she sat and penned a note.::<br>
My dearest friends:<br>
Word cannot explain how sorry I am to miss our dinner last night.  Duties were overwhelming and I just lost track of time.  Please forgive me.<br>
I hope this basket is enjoyable to you both.  And I shall be by the Inn at 9 AM to take you both for breakfast and show you around the Island.  I know you are anxious to return to your home, but allow me one more day to be with you both.<br>
See you in a few hours.<br>

She hoped that the ladies forgave her.:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://hometown.aol.com/queenhippolyte/BC.html BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(8/15/00 4:46 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://facelink.com/Hippolyte?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Next Morning </span><hr size=1> ::Hipp woke with the sun peaking in thru the window to her room.  She had quickly fell asleep in the soft bed, the night before.  But, the smells from outside and the sun awoke her senses.  She quickly dressed and brushed her auburn hair.  She grabbed a purple silk chamise, belted it with her golden belt and then quickly ran out to the barn and checked upon Monsoon.  After nuzzling the mare, she found a brush hanging on the stall wall and lovingly brushed the mare.  <br>
After spending needed time with the mare, she returned to her room.  There she found the basket of flowers and fruit.  She smiled at the site of the food and quickly grabbed a string of grapes.  Then noticed the note.  She read it as best she could, english still so foreign to her.  But, she managed to make out what Justine was tgrying to say.  She quickly tossed some grapes in her mouth.  And then walked over to the water basin by the mirror.  It had been refreshed with clean water and two fresh, dry soft white cloth lay beside it.  Hipp pulled off her chamise, now covered in horse hair and threw it into an open saddle bag.  She grabbed a clothe and wet it.  Then washing her body as best she could.:: I am going to have to find a lake or stream and do this right :: she rolls her eyes at cleaning like this.  Then finishes and again brushes her hair.  She bent down to a saddle bag and looked for new clothes. She found a new clean silk garment and threw it over her head, then belted her golden belt around it. Then placed her scabbard and scimitar to another leather belt at her waist.  As she walked to the door..she reached out and pulled her Queen's cape from a hook on the wall.. and unceremoniously throwing it over her shoulder.  She knocked upon Sethra's door:: Hey!  Yaasooooo.. Sethra.  I will meet you down stairs at the tavern. :: After hearing a endaksi/okay from inside....she walked to the tavern.  She found a seat near a window and sat down.  A wench came and brought Hippolyte her favorite wine..which made the amazon queen smirk.  She waved her hands and asked the queen for something warm to drink and eat.  The woman smiled, left and then brought back some coffee.  Hipp raised an eyebrow and then sipped it.:: Ah... kala!  ::The amazon queen contented drank the coffee and watched the people pass by outside the window.  After a bit, the wench brought back Queen Hippolyte two plates heaped with food.  Hipp smiled and began to eat.  She thought, ohhh how it tasted sooo good.  Then as she ate and drank..she went back to her people watching out the window.:::: <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ujustineash.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JustineAsh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(8/15/00 8:11 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Next Morning </span><hr size=1> ::Justine didn't want to be late today.  She kissed Dabby, Fhad and slapped Anna on her rump playfully and ran out the door and down the hill to the Inn.  She stopped at the door to fix her hair which was windblown about her, pinning her hair up into a ponytail.  <br>
She opened the door and went inside, giving her eyes a few moments to adjust to the darkness from the bright sun.  She smiled as she saw the Queen and the large plates of food before her.  She was glad that the InnKeeper was taking care of her guests so well.  <br>
Justine walked over to her and trying to remember the gestures, she saluted the Queen as the Queen had done to Justine when she first arrived.::<br>
I hope I did that right Hipp.  I've been practicing.  Was it good or as really bad as I felt it was?<br>
::Justine chuckled taking a seat across from her.  The serving wench slipping a cup of coffee in front of her.  The wench made sure that the Queen still had enough food before slipping away from the table.:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Sethra</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(8/16/00 8:07 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The morning</span><hr size=1> :: Sethra fell back asleep after Hipp had woken her up.
