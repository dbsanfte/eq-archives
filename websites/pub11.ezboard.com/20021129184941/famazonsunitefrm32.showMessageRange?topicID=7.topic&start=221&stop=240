She wouldn't give anyone the satisfaction of seeing her smile during a war. <br>
<br>
 Her hands moved to her back, tossing the 5 pound leather scabbard to the ground, it landed with an almost silent thud. Then her hands removed the empty sheaths on her thighs, each weighed maybe a pound and a half. And when they hit the ground, were even more silent than the scabbard before them.<br>
<br>
 Shoulders were rolled back, and her neck cracked. For a moment her crimson eyes turned to the battle ground, where everyone was fighting. There was a glimmer of hope, seeing Sartha and Alysia fighting. But a resounding loss with Hippolyte having left the field.<br>
<br>
 &quot;You and the rest that are fighting us are so stupid.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn's voice was shakey, filled with hate an anger as she continued to watch everyone fight. Her last look was toward Ares, before she turned her eyes back to Fogstone.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Even if you win a war, you have not killed our race, nor the Queens that bring us forth. We have more gods that support us in this struggle, than you could ever imagine.&quot;<br>
<br>
 With that, Dawn struck. A clean side kick, toward Fogstone's knee. <br>
<br>
 The assassin had trained more with hand to hand combat, than anything else in her life. The quickness of her movements could hardly be matched, and the strength that followed, equal to her speed. The kick was ment to render Fogstone somewhat uncapable of running, or fighting as well. If anything, it'd break his knee cap.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I'm fighting the good fight. I don't know what you think you're fighting.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn growled, not giving a chance for a counter attack. Her good hand grabbed the near by tree limb, swinging herself upward into the tree, before taking off to the next tree. Before hitting the ground to run. She was a good 10 ft from Fogstone.<br>
<br>
 Leading him out into the open of the battle ground. Where everything else was taking place, away from the unconcious Maytha. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=hypnos>Hypnos </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 241<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/24/01 9:07:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=222>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> wounded</span><hr size=1> ***As soon as Hypnos returned to reality, he felt the arrow hit his chest as he fell to the ground paralyzed.

On the silvery will of vengance he flew, fast and furious. As Apollo stopped above the whimpering Hypnos a wicked wind blew from the west, probably supplied by Zephyr to signify his anger towards the lowly god of sleep. His arms lay across his chest, his glaze ice cold.<br>
<br>
&quot;I told you before Hypnos. You fight me, you fight all that is good, all that is right, all that is light. Dark-eyed lord of darkness, you bring shame to Olympus on this day. Surely the Aegis-bearing, Father Zeus will take up private council with you, giving you such a verbal lashing you will be feeling it for millennia to come. You said to never, never, ever, ever underestimate a god of darkness.&quot; Apollo laughed a bit, placing his foot upon Hypnos's chest, applying gradual pressure.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well if you haven't noticed, smart one. Light usually dispenses dark.&quot; Apollo sneered as he lifted his leg and slammed it into the ribs of the dormant Hypnos. Apollo saw the look of discomfort and pain upon the sleep god's face, the wound from the arrow bleeding from his chest.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, that looks like it hurts.&quot; Apollo bent down and touched the wound, a look of pure fear washed over the face pale face of Hypnos.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let me help you!&quot; Apollo cackled as a dager appeared in his divine hand. Swiftly and vengefully the dager found its way into the chest of Hypnos. Apollo stood up and raised his leg and kicked Hypnos in the ribs yet again.<br>
<br>
He spat at Hypnos, scowling down at him. <br>
<br>
&quot;Your not even worth my precious time. So I will let you be Hypnos. Don't bother me again. Only if you wish to apologize will I hear your plea's. Cowardly Lord of Sleep. Return to your cave, in the shadowy lands of Lemnos where you reside. For no one on this battlefield wishes to see your face. And I promise you Hypnos, your life will be tortured, and unfortunate until you appease me. And remember Hypnos, my power goes unmatched upon Olympus after that of my father. So don't mess with me. If you wish to beseech me, you know where to find me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Apollo gave Hypnos the nastiest look he could conjure up. Apollo's eyes bounced to see the shocked faces of the other gods and goddesses that called Olympus their home. Some faces were shocked, but most faces, faces of those who witnessed the injustices suffered by Apollo.Those faces were those of a satisfied wolf pup, having just got his fill of his mothers milk. Grunting, just for effect, Apollo stormed away from the limp body of Hypnos over to the reflecting pool, to his sister and Aphrodite. <p>      *~*The Golden God*~*

Her slight distraction caused her as an arrow flies from nowhere and embeds itself in her shoulder. Crying out with a low growl, she snaps the tip off and yanks the shaft out, hurling it to the ground in a fit of rage.<br>
<br>
Finally spotting the soldier who shot her, she races furiously toward him, swings her sword in a giant arc, and slices his head clean off, catching another soldier in the chest with the powerful swing.<br>

His gaze falls to his enemies and he screams in pain and in rage. His trident disappears from his back and into his hands. He holds the weapon before his chest and it glows with energy.

Trees fall into the open earth and jutting, jagged boulders rip from beneath the ground up into the faces of Poseidon's enemies. His face tightens in pain and the sky crackles with thunder and lightning. Clouds come forth at his bidding and huge storms open up into the land, lightning spliting trees and at times hitting unlucky victims dead. Thunder snaps so loud that rocks crack and eardrums break in pain. The dirt turns to mud and soon is drowned in the deepening rains that come down hard like needles.

Olympus itself shook lightly, as the tremor wiped the earth. Poseidon fell to the ground, blood spewing from every region of his body. Apollo could see that Poseidon was in dire need of his divine assistance.<br>
<br>
From the frigid cap of Olympus flew Apollo to the battlefield. He appeared, apparent only to those with divine eyes. His powder blue tunic flapped in the wind slightly, his white knee-length cap following it. There was a calm breeze blowing across the battlefield. Few were left standing. Apollo shook his head at the sight. The ground was soaked in blood, bodies lie over bodies, some still trembling. Holding onto the thin threads of life.<br>
<br>
Apollo's rage grew as he flew over to Fogstone, floating several feet above the ground. His eyes narrowed as he spoke:<br>
<br>
&quot;Fogstone, foreigner from the west. Who are you to come to beloved Greece and stain its lands with the blood of its own people? Greece itself trembles with anger towards you and the foreigners you bring to our land. Not only do you manipulate the divinities, but you kill your own people. Leading them into battle with immortals. To be killed. To be slaughtered.  And you Fogstone, stand on your high-horse, a pillar in the Paegan religion. Do we Greeks not time after time, stop the advancements of the barbaric Paegan's from the north?&quot; Apollo shook his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wander off on a tangent. This has nothing to do with the point I put across to you. Fogstone, LOOK AT THIS BATTLEFIELD!?&quot; Apollo open's his arm to display the carnage that lie behind him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your soldiers lie dead, victim to Amazonian strength and bravery. Even the divinities on the side of you army lie in sorry state on this night. Poseidon lie unconscious, the might Earth-shaker, bearer of the mighty trident. Hypnos, silver-footed Lord of Sleep, lies in ruin within his save in Lemnos. Hecate stands, impaled and in no condition to fight for you. You have no more help Fogstone. You stand on your own. You may continue to fight, but no one will help you. You are a fool, comming to Greece and trying to split it in two. For shame. Such opprobriousness will not go unpunished. For you do nothing but bring pain and grief to those around you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Apollo shook his head to Fogstone.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go back from whence you came Fogstone. We do not want you here in Greece any longer. Take your filth, and your ignorance with you. We have no space for it here. In this land of uneasy peace and philosophy, there is no room for close-mindedness, and aggression. End this foolish bickering, if you wish to lead a untormented life Fogstone.&quot;<br>
<br>
Apollo flew to the limp body of Trident-bearing Poseidon. He knelt down, with his gently hand sweeping the brown locks of hair from his unshaven face. He scooped Poseidon into his arms, careful not to trip into the chasms that lie around him. His warm golden aura, began to swirl at his feet, soon engulfing his whole body and sweeping off to the summit of Olympus.<br>
<br>
Arriving at Olympus, the swirl turned its course, doing the opposite of what it had before, and placed Apollo near a sofa. He lowered Poseidon down onto the sofa. He had told Hebe to prepare a medical table of herbs and other things near the sofa while he was gone. Apollo began the daunting task of fixing all of Poseidon's wounds.<br>
<br>
Several hours had past since Apollo had started work on Poseidon. His wounds were mended, and his bones fixed back into place. He would have to wear and arm cast for several months, he broke it pretty sloppily. He had cracked his skull to, and it would have to remain bandaged for a couple of months along with his arm. All Apollo could do now was wait, for Poseidon to wake.<br>
<br>
He stood and walked over to the reflecting pool and stared at the battle below. He wondered of any of his words had touched the arrogant Fogstone.<br>

From Olympus he flew, fast and steady to the battlefield. The Amazons were gathering their things, salvaging what they could from the destruction. The battle had ended as suddenly as it had started. He shook his head. Thanatos, black god of death, had taken his claim on so very many lives on the whirl-wind weeks of the battle. Hermes, flea-footed bringer of souls, had his work cut out for him. Hermes could actually be seen parading souls in groups of ten to the river Styx, the closest river, and opening to Hades from the battlefield.<br>
<br>
Apollo flew to a tree, and stood in one of its highest branches. Appearing in his hands was his lyre. His soft fingers began to strum the strings. Whimsical notes filled the air, as he played a new song, one he had written not to long ago. He had named it &quot;Misery's Sorrow&quot; and he found it to be perfect for this situation. He opened his mouth, his heavenly voice flowing from it. His eyes closed as he began to feel the music flow through his very veins. He could not be seen to the Amazons, but his music could be heard.And to those few divinities that remained on the battlefield, he appeared to be of a painting. Strumming his lyre, and singing, glowing eerily as always, just as the sun began to kiss the sky.<br>
<br>
*And we pay tribute to those that died for the Amazonian cause in the battle that lie behind us. Thank you for you bravery. Your memory lives on.*<br>
<br>
Apollo lifted his arm and had this written in the starry sky. Death is a sorrowful thing, but is even more so when life is lost in chaos. In remembrace of the lives lost in the battle Apollo commanded that the sun not fully rise for the rest of the day. Instead it will stay in the gates of Dawn. So that the sky may be half illuminated, and have darkened to signify that life (the lights), is synonymous with death (the dark). <p>      *~*The Golden God*~*

Unfortantly, her powers had told her of how certain events would occur during the war would play out.  As Hippolyte fell from her horse, Hera bit her teeth and stood firmly upon the hillside.  She knew that Hippolyte would be alright after a few couple months of healing from the wound.  And that the pain and attack were meant to be.  For soon there would be even a greater war, and Hera did not want Hippolyte to be apart of it.  It was going to be a war that only a handful of amazons would return from.  The fewer who went would be better.  <br>
Her cold eyes watched as Pentheslea's face was covered in pain for the death of her sister.  But, Pentheslea's fate was sealed.  There was no turning back.<br>
Many amazons had died this day.  And Hera was very unhappy about that.  The fact the one was killed by her own kind.  That was even more horrid.  Hera watched as DeLerium took her place as the hand of the Fates.  The amazons had enough enemies, without one coming from their own.<br>
As the forces seemed to be pulling back and recovering their wounded and weapons.  Hera dissappeared in a flash of light.  She had a wedding to attend to and hanging out on a battlefield was not the order of the day.<br>
