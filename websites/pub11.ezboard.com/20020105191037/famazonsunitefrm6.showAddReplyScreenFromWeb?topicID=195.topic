Alysia then smiled and stepped back letting others have their chance. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 337<br> <font color=#993300>(9/10/01 3:18:22 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Presents</span><hr size=1>  Dawn stepped up to the thrown, no one had seemed to notice the ten week old tiger cub follow her inside. It was the one that had kept track of everyone, when Dawn left for that short time. <br>
<br>
 &quot;Everyone knows I'm noted for animals.. especially my tigers.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn smiled lightly, as she held out a collar to Belle, the tiger was un-named, and she was to put the name on the collar. <br>
<br>
 &quot;She'll take care of you.. as Wulf's has done for him. . and mine for Orio-Pata. I hope you enjoy your horse as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn nodded, before stepping down and making her way to her seat. <p>

She wasn't used to being showered with gifts, or even her birthday being acknowledged...<br>
<br>
She pulled her hair around shoulder as she necklece was slipped on her neck, and she brought it up towards her face to admire it slightly. She took it as a great honor to get something someone obviously held dear, if they had warn in it since they had become Queen...<br>
<br>
&quot;Efharisto, Vasilissa...&quot;<br>
<br>
She thanked Dawn with a warm smile, taking the collar in her hands and smiling down at the demonic tiger cub. She adored animals, and was extremely grateful to Dawn for both the tiger and the horse. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6>Amazons of the Northern Lands</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
