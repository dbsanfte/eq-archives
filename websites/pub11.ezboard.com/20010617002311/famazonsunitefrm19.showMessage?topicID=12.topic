Each of them had cast some sort of glance to the two Queens, knowing all too well that something was going to happen. And each Queen had given a smile to those they passed, especially the young-ns who wanted to aspire to their standards.<br>
<br>
 Finally Dawn had led Alysia to the middle of the forest, it had been cleared out into an oval and a few Shamans (sp?) had come out to greet the Queens. <br>
<br>
 In the center of the clearing was a prepared spring of water. The shamans had taken time to put herbs such as Sandalwood and patchouli. The Sandalwood to help free negativity and the patchouli was to increase the sexuality of a woman. All good for a cleansing ritual involving marriage. White and Red rose petals floated in the damned off spring.<br>
<br>
 Now as Dawn began to walk away the Shamaness' came to Alysia, and began to help undress her. They would clean her and prepare her for the physical means of her marriage. Eli would appreciate a clean bride.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Enjoy M'Dear Alysia. They will clean you all up.&quot;<br>
<br>
 With that Dawn dissappeared into the trees, she'd return later to check on her sister.<br>

<br>
She was happy to be recieving a ritual without any afflictions of pain or anything. From now on, her spirit would be of good nature and she would lead the Amazon Nation as well as her daughter to the greater good of life.<br>
<br>
She smiled as the Shamans helped her into the spring, running water over her flesh like fire to a breeze she errupted inside having so much going on she could barely contain herself as the Shamans helped to cleanse her body as well as her soul. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Queen</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#939393>(3/31/01 11:29:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The ritual</span><hr size=1>  Dawn reappeared later that day, carrying a few more roses and melted steal. Aly had thought their be no pain, but as comes anything from Dawn she has to put her mark. As Aly was helped out of the spring they brought her to a fur, where the Shaman's laid her onto her stomach. <br>
<br>
 Dawn kneeled next to Aly and smiled, placing a cold heart shaped pink petal on Aly's right shoulder blade. Placing it there at a crooked angle she took the hot silver and put it around the petal. It clung to her skin now, as a tattoo. Just like the horses and the rest of Dawn's tattoos. Over the petal she put a clear mixture to seal it. <br>
<br>
 With that Dawn rose and Shamans began chanting and rubbing oils over Aly. They were cleansing her soul and spirit physically as well as mentally with the relaxation. <br>
<br>
 The tattoo showed the greater good that Aly would follow. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10> at: 3/31/01 11:31:19 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualysiaofscynthia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alysia of Scynthia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#939393>(3/31/01 11:41:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The ritual</span><hr size=1> She knew it was comming. She had to suffer more. The tattoo was painful of course, but worth it in the end. On her body she know had 4 tattooes. One upon her right shoulder that clearly said &quot;Scynthian Queen&quot; in Greek lettering. Another right below it of a wolf's head. On her left leg, she bore five marks. One of a star symbolizing Cora's birth in the brightness of night. Another two were placed together as ribbons circling one another reselbing the twins, Aliya and Alexa. She then bore the mark of a paw, saying of Wulf's memory. And then the latest one, clearly was the mark of the Elisians speaking her love of her daughter Vyiana. She now had another added and she would always remember the greater good for the sake of everything in life.<br>

<br>
 &quot;I believe when the Shamans are done, so are you. You did get my present in Scynthia, right?&quot;<br>
<br>
 She smiled lightly, watching Aly relax. Dawn didn't believe any of the Amazons had really relaxed, after the war in Scynthia or the hard winter in Themiscrya. Aly deserved all this happiness.<br>
<br>
 &quot;May your relationship with Eli be long an prospurious my sister. Through your hardships you have truely found what you need. May you take care of him and may he take care of you. But never forget where you preside...for you preside in the Amazon Nation, emotionally, physically and mentally. You are truely something my sister.&quot;<br>

 Dawn smiled as the shamans stopped and helped Aly up.<br>

Two Shamans came to her draping her body in a soft white cloth to symbolize the purity of her upcomming marriage.<br>
<br>
She then looked to Dawn.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dawn, I worry so much about the future. I have no daughter to fill my place when I decide to pass from this mortal world. Cora's place is clearly in Rome. And Eli and I have decided to raise Vyiana as an Elisian. He has had many visions and she must never have any training of battle. Nor know of any violence, I trust him and know that it will be best for her. But what if we have more children, will they all be Elisians?&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked down.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Scynthian tribe continues to prosper much, but I sadly fear that when I do pass, it will fall because there will be no royal connection to such.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then changed the subject. . . <br>
<br>
&quot;Dawn, I have never been married before. Nor have I ever known anyone who's marriage has been truly happiness, can you tell me what it's like?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Queen</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#939393>(4/4/01 7:20:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=AmazonWarMaskofDeath WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The ritual</span><hr size=1>  Dawn smiled lighlty as she walked with her sister, clasping her hand into her own two. A nice sandwhich of hands....<br>
<br>
 &quot;Don't worry a thing Aly. Vyiana will be okay, Eli will raise her in the path of love, and you will assist. And one day you will get a child to pass onto the Amazon Race. She'll be there following you completely through. I'm sure Eli realizes you must have a descendent within your tribe. And I promise you that everything will be okay on that aspect. It always will be.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn smiled lightly, her eyes closing as she is asked about the marriage she is having problems with herself. She took a deep breathe debating on where to start.<br>
<br>
 &quot;To tell you the truth Alysia, marriages aren't one big line of happiness. Its a rough trail full of pot holes.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn smirked lightly at the analogy figuring it would work.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Somedays its perfectly blissful, and somedays you just wish you would have never married that man. But the best part is you know you love him and that deep down you are truly happy even if you are mad at him. Because he has given you his heart and you have given him yours. Its a hard thing to explain.&quot;<br>
<br>
 She smirked softly to herself, satisified with the answer she had given.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Besides Aly everyone's marriage is different. And you will learn from mistakes after mistakes, not only that you learn from the good things. If you do something right for him you'll know what to do again if the time arises. Don't worry about it though. You'll make a great wife.&quot; <p>Pyschotic injustice
Mommy made me this way
Evil and hungry
I'm just a craving soul
Craving for your blood and death; M'Dear
Don't worry it won't hurt..
Just a dagger or two.. 
Crimson spilling onto my hands..
Running over the flesh to drip from my elbow
Scarring the black leather pants..
Mmmm its yummy
Don't worry I only strike once...
Don't bother to scream... they won't catch me
