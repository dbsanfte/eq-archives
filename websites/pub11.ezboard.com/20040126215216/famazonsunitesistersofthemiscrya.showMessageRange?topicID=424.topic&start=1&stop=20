Her priestess's had placed Gabrielle's wrapped body ontop of a platform sitting ontop of a pile of logs. Arround her body were different Herbs and flowers. The herbs given to Vasilissa De'Lerium were sprinkled over and under her death shroud.<br>
<br>
Around the unlit pyre, there stood 4 tourches, each in the proper direction of the North, South, West and East. The light casting eerie shadows along the snowcovered ground..<br>
<br>
In the wood, standing on pint, were Gabrielle's Sais. She did not know what to dowith them, or who to give them to. So she would wait to see who claimed them. More then liekly someone from her tribe.<br>
<br>
She took a dagger and slit an opening in her hand, taking her pointer finger on her other hand, she dipped it in and began to draw the sacred symbols on the wrappings.<br>
<br>
When she was through, she gave out the death cry, it was time to gather.

Once there, she bowed in respect of Dlasta, Virgin of Artemis, then walked to Gabrielle's body. She placed a hand on her foot and wispered a prayer.

<br>
&quot;Tonight, Athelfi, we bid farewell to our Warrior Bard, Our Amazon Vasilissa Gabrielle. She has passed from this life, I am sure, to succedd in another.  Her lose came toa  shock to many o fus. I myself did not know her that well. But her stories and bardwork, were familiar to me. I have read much of her journies with Xena. At this time. I would like for anyone to come up, and say anything they would like about gabrielle, something to help us all, understand what we might not of known, for truly, we can not all know a person in the same way.&quot;<br>

Zoe was tugging along behind her a young mare of the purest white.  She held a gold-colored rope which was tied around the horse's nose as best as her tiny hands could.  She was clad in a lose white dress with belled-out sleeves, tied languidly to her waist by a matching rope which twisted around her mare's nose.  Her bare feet, not used to Earth's harsh surface, were cut and bruised from the dreaded travel to visit her mother for the last time.<br>
<br>
The young Lykastian Princess was not ready for her mother to leave her.  Zoe was too inexperienced to the Amazon World around her, and now, she had no one.  Her blue orbs, puffed and reddened by the tears which fell and are still falling, looked upon her mother's body in the distance.<br>
<br>
She wished her shyness away, but wasn't granted that.  She wanted to step into the crowd and bid her mother a lasting prayer, or kiss, or something!  She wanted to see her mother!<br>
<br>
A soft nudge was felt on the back of her head and she turned around, placing her hand on the bottom of her mare's nose to comfort Sylver.  She closed her stinging eyes and rested her forehead across Sylver's bridge.  Soft sniffles breathed in cold air into her lungs.<br>
<br>
Her words were light and depressing, &quot;Sylvie...please bring mommy back.  I'm not ready to be out on my own.  I have no one now to care for me.&quot; Two tears rolled down her little flushed cheeks. &quot;My wings are not big enough to fly yet, I need my mommy...&quot;<br>
<br>
Sylver let out her regular snort, which sent a few of Zoe's locks behind her ears.  Her mare nudged her once again, pressing her to enter into the crowd.<br>
<br>
She turned, gulping once again, and tightly gripped Sylver's rope.  With closing her eyes once again, and opening them moments later, she began to make her way towards her mother's body. She stopped behind a few Amazons, still crying as every child would do when they lost their mommy. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Zoe</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, The mystic Lykastian Princess<br>

A loud wolf cry was heard in mourning for the deceased as Alysia came walking through the crowd. Elea bowed her head in respect for her Queen. <br>
<br>
She wore short leathers and no boots. Tattoos adorning her body symbolizing her life. She looked down at her athelfi Gabrielle and whispered in ancient Tretmolec:<br>
<br>
~&quot; Death is never in vain when you've made a difference in the world. . .and in the Nation. &quot;~<br>
<br>
Alysia lowered her head lightly giving Gabrielle's spirit a blessing for safety in the world to come. She then sighed as she saw Zoe. She hadn't seen the little girl in some time now. But Alysia had always loved the little girl ever since Gabrielle came to Scynythia long ago, pregnant with the Amazon Princess. <br>
<br>
Aly nodded to River and placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. She then lowered herself to face Zoe where she whispered.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you ever need anything Zoe, you have your athelfi to rely on. And you may come to Scynthia whenever you wish child.&quot;<br>
<br>
She sighed lightly. She remembered long ago she had made a promise to Gabrielle. She would assist Zoe in training in the Shaman and other traits. She would not break her promise. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">~*~ Jessica ~*~<br>

It was odd that a New Queen would rise, and that an old Queen would fall. She had traveled to Themiscrya, with Xenira's condolenses, she knew only Amazons would be allowed in the hallowed burial ground. <br>
<br>
She followed a little behind Alyisa, hearing only by word that Her grandmother was back, but...it was a time for mourning, not a time for celebration. She came up behind Alysia-Samsara and the child, placing a comforting hand on Aly's shoulder, not speaking. Aly had gone through alot these past few years. Losing her mother, then Wulf, and then just recently having to go through a trial. She knew all she and Belle would have to do was to be there for Aly and the rest of the Athelfi who loved Gabrielle. <br>
<br>
Odessa wasn't known to have much emotion, and she didn't have now. She was in sorrow than a fellow athelfi died, but the way she held herself never showed it. She truly was a strong Amazon. She whispered a silent prayer to the Atmah, and closed her eyes. She squeezed Aly's shoulder in a comforting way, letting here know she was there...<br>
