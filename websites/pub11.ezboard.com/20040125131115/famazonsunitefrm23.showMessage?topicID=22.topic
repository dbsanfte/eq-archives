Emerging slowly from the depths, Hermes made his appearance.  From the looks of his face, he didn't seem too pleased.<br>

&quot;What's the problem here&quot;, demanded Hermes.  &quot;Do you know this bickering amongst the Pantheon has spread amongst the mortals as well?&quot;<br>
<br>
::I have just returned from Hades realm where I have just delivered the next batch of souls.  The majority of them died fighting over who deserves this temple.  It seems there's a Holy war erupting on earth.<br>
<br>
Hermes pointed his staff in front of him, and a swirling mist appeared.  In it, was shone the events that are occurring on earth.<br>
<br>
::Here's the battlefield right outside Rome, and here's the outcome in Thebes.  Both sides have taken heavy losses.  If I didn't know better, I would think brother Ares was involved.<br>

It is pitch black for atleast a mile around. Then in a explosion of light appears the Golden God Apollo. He was wearing a red tunic, his laurel and sandels of gold. His small cape was blowing to an unfelt wind. The light slowly returned to the area, the expresion on his face of anger. He stood next to Hermes.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wholly agree with our brother Hermes, who appears to be wise beyond his years. You fools sit around arguing over who is the true god of love. Tis neither of you! Aphrodite, the fair, is the true divinity of love, for she encompasses all aspects of the word. Emotional, Physical, and Phsyciological. You two, are minor gods of &quot;love&quot;. You Cupid, spark desire. You Dionysus, spark carnal excitement. Neither of you encompass love in its entirty. So stop this foolish bickering! By your foolish arguing mortal die, not that I care if they die, but the death of mortals effect each and everyone of us in a different way. Keep in mind, our young brother Hermes must lead the dead to the Underworld. And in mortals dying, some of us lose supporters.&quot; he crosses his arms.<br>
<br>
&quot;I suggest you BOTH bite you tounge, and apologize to Aphrodite. You disgrace love itself by arguing over it! Love is to be cherished and shared, not fought over like a scrap of meat to wolf pups. I am ashamed of both of you, as I am sure alot of us are.&quot;<br>
