But he wasn't sure what it could be.  Waygarth is a kingdom way up north.  A land of perpetual snow and ice.  Yet the kingdom has done very well, especially in trade and commerce.  And wherever there's money involved, Hermes wouldn't be very far away.  So Waygarth is a land Hermes frequents often.  Yet recently, things were going awry.  Little things that many would disregard, and most likely overlook.  But for Hermes, where attention to detail often garnered vast rewards, these little quirks were sparking little red flags of warning in his mind.<br>
<br>
As Hermes wandered invisibly among the populace, the word &quot;Grunkar&quot; was mentioned repeatedly.  He noticed that there were a myriad of reactions amongst the folks when these words were mentioned.  But two emotions stood out the most, fear and anger.  Hermes didn't like this at all.  Not knowing can lead to disaster.  And fear and anger often disrupted commerce, and therefore profit.<br>
<br>
Hermes realized that some sleuthing was needed.  And so he decided to head towards the capital.  Maybe he can find King Vasdorf and eavesdrop a bit.<br>

Hermes has assumed that Madmartigan prefered warmer climates, and even warmer blooded women. But then again, this is Madmartigan.  Madmartigan has always intrigued Hermes, and this was another interesting factoid about Madmartigan that Hermes will remember.  Never underestimate anyone, and never assume, especially when it's Madmartigan.<br>
<br>
And so Hermes took this encounter with Madmartigan as being fortuitious.  After all, Hermes is the God of Fortune, and who better to have fortune smile upon than he who is fortune.<br>
<br>
And so, with a wave of his hand, Hermes transported Madmartigan and himself to one of Hermes's favorite spots, a little pocket of space in the ether.  For some reason, Hermes felt it prudent to be extremely cautious, he wasn't sure who might be listening.<br>
<br>
&quot;Madmartigan, I am glad to have met you in Waygarth.  Why you are this far up north, I will not question.  But I need your wise counsil.  Have you noticed that the people of Waygarth are extremely agitated? The name Grunkar has been whispered everywhere I've been.  The name is familiar, but I can not recall where I have heard it before.  All I know is that it is very important that we find out.  My bones ache, as if they are speaking, warning me that something dreadful is about to occur.  Or it may have occured already!  All I know is this could rock both Heaven and Hell.&quot;<br>

I can tell you that it hasen't happened yet, or i would have known about it, but it is probubly soon to happen. Very soon.

<br>
Hermes stops talking for a minute, as his eyes suddenly lose focus.  Something on the mortal realm has sparked his attention.<br>
<br>
&quot;No!!  There has been a sacrifice made in the name of Grunkar!  A human sacrifice!!  But it was performed improperly and a precious human soul has been lost to that demon.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait here Madmartigan while I gather this wayward soul and we can question it together.&quot;<br>
<br>
In a blaze of immortal fury, Hermes departs.  And just as suddenly he reappears, but this time, not alone.  He has with him, chained and bound a wraith.  Usually Hermes treats souls with tender care, but in this case, Hermes has this one, bound as if it were a prisoner.  And it truth it is.<br>
<br>
&quot;Madmartigan, this dispicable creature is a lost soul.  He gave himself FREELY, and for that I can not commend him to Hades.  I only have a limited time before even I will lose control of it.  Quickly, we must unearth as much information as we can from this pitiful insect.&quot;<br>
<br>
With eyes of unbridled fury, Hermes turns to the soul.  But instead of fear, Hermes and Madmartigan sees triumph written on its face.  It knows that wherever he is going, neither Madmartigan nor Hermes can follow.<br>

&quot;Are you doing this?&quot; asks Madmartigan, as he watched in fascination.<br>
<br>
Hermes shook his head.  &quot;I may be angry, but even I wouldn't torment the dead.  This creature's pain is not my doing.&quot;<br>
<br>
As they watched, the wraith screamed out with even more agony.  Suddenly, as if invisible claws were tearing it to shreds, the wraith flew into hundreds of gossamyr pieces.<br>
<br>
&quot;By all that's holy, may you find peace&quot; prayed Hermes.  His heart saddened by what had occurred.<br>
<br>
&quot;Enough, we can't let this atrocity continue.  We must find out more about this.  I suggest, Madmartigan, that we split up.  Enlist as many others as we can.  I don't think we can do this alone.  Maybe the Oracle in Thebes can be of help.&quot;<br>
<br>
Madmartigan, brandishing his Rune Blade, whispered the mystical words that would allow him to traverse the multiverse, silently disappeared in a plume of darkness.<br>
<br>
Hermes looks around at the now empty void.  Once again, it looks like the balance of Life has once again been disturbed.  Before he too disappeared, his final thought was &quot;But will this be the last?&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;Thank you all for being here.  I have very dire news.  I had gone to Qrendril, the Tree of Time, and I traced the name Grunkar.  It's very very bad.&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking around them, Hermes decided that it wasn't even safe talking about this even here at the base Mt. Olympus.   And so he wrote in the air, a fiery runic symbol, and suddenly an irredescent bubble surrounded those gathered.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope this will be enough.  What I am about to tell you is very important.  The reason so much security is needed is because the demon we're dealing with has agents all around us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;At the Tree, the Tree Hag informed me that Grunkar was actually one of the progenitors of the Titans.  As Chronus is the progenitor of Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, and Hades.  So too is Grunkar one of the progenitors of the Titans.  When the Titans were banished into Tartarus, so too had the Titans banished Grunkar in eons past.  It seems the last time the Titans had escaped, they had awakened Grunkar.  But he is only semi-conscious, only his astral self is aware, his body is still trapped.  That is why I am so scared about talking out in the open.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It seems that acolytes of Grunkar has been amassing up north, in Waygarth.  Their failed attempt at a human sacrifice indicates that they are still disorganized.  And this gives us hope.  Some of us has to deal with the acolytes, and some has to deal with the chaos they have already wrecked.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then Hermes hesitates, as he prepares himself to utter the next sentence.<br>
<br>
&quot;And some of us have to brave the nightmares of Tartarus to deal with Grunkar and his minions.&quot;<br>

&quot;Good.  But before we do, we need to fid out more about Grunkar.  Stopping him will not be easy.  And we still don't know who else may be involved.  So before we act, we need to disperse and do some detective work.&quot;<br>
