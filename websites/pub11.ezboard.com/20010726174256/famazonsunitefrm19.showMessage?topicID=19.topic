All her life, she had hidden in the forests, protecting the Capital of the Amazons.  But, this time the queen had asked her to join her to visit Queen Dawnithinia's lands.

From there she had dissappeared out of her hut and now stood next to the resting post. You'd never know how she got there, and Marpe would never figure it out.

But it was her choice to sit out in the forest and loose very valuable social skills.<br>
 &quot;Well Hippolyte, Marpe please make yourselves at Home in Orio-pata. I know you probably won't be staying long but the time you are here I wish you to be very happy, and at home.&quot; <br>
 Dawn smiled again, and she motioned around the village.<br>
 &quot;How about I show you to the guest hut, and let you get rested and come back later and show you around, maybe get you a bite to eat. Satisfy hunger cravings. When you are ready you may go back to Themiscrya.&quot;<br>

 &quot;You aren't interrupting anything, and the only things I have to do, is show you two around, practice, and hunt. The latter two can wait awhile, getting you two settled is priority one at the moment.&quot;<br>

 Dawn turned and walked past a few more huts, and the stopped. There were two huts side by side that had the letter G carved into their door. Dawn stood between the two, and pointed.<br>
<br>
 &quot;These are the two guest huts. You can choose the one you'd like to stay in.&quot;<br>
<br>
 She smiled to Marpe and then to Hipp. <br>
<br>
 Inside the huts, each was decorated about the same. Furnished with a bed, that had blankets and a large pelt. The one on the right had a black wolf pelt and the one on the left had a brown bear pelt. Each had a desk, chairs, a bottle of red wyne, a few goblets. On the walls they were decorated with swords, pictures etc. Nothing big, and nothing to elaborate, just like home.<br>
<br>
 &quot;You two can get settled in, and I'll be back in a few hours to show you around.&quot;<br>

As she passed amazons in the street she nodded in respect to each one.  And those she knew, a slight smile rose to her face in greeting.  <br>
The two Themiscryan's followed Dawn into the hall, where Orio-Pata amazons had gathered in celebration.  Hipp was glad to see the tribe had grown to it's numbers.  The Orio-Pata and the Caucaus Mountain Amazons were the link between the southern and northern tribes.  Keeping the gateway open between the two worlds of the Amazon Nation.  <br>
Hipp's brown eyes danced over to Dawn and she smiled as she watched the Queen among her people.  Dawn had certainly become a fine queen and done very well.  She was another link in the chain of a powerful Amazon Nation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 231<br> <font color=#939393>(7/24/01 7:00:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The feast.. the fun..</span><hr size=1>  Dawn smiled to those she saw, and those who bowed in respect were given a short amazon salute. Dawn was a very proud Queen even if her tribe was that of a small number, most were strong and could take anyone on in battle. <br>
 <br>
 That was all the Amazon Queen wanted, a strong tribe for battle..and a happy tribe any time else. A tribe with no man slayers, for Orio-Pata didn't exactly help the reputation of the tribe.<br>
<br>
 Dawn slipped inside the main hut, where the feast was being prepared and the other Amazons had gathered for the event. The Queen went about duties, of reminsing with the early gathering of Amazons, then once everyone had went back to their conversations or what not Dawn went back to Hippolyte and Marpe.<br>
<br>
 &quot;The feast should be starting soon, and then I'm sure you'll have time to catch up with everyone, and meet those that you do not know.&quot;<br>
<br>
 She smiled, turning her back to the others, as she spoke with the Queen of Themiscrya, and her watchful gaurdian. <p>

These were certainly a warrior group of amazons.  She chuckled to herself, as they reminded her much of Themiscrya years ago.  These were amazons that a man should not dare cross a path with.  Or like the old days of Themiscrya, the man would feel he had suddenly been surrounded by the wild hyenas of africa...laughing and taunting him..filling him with fear.  <br>
As Dawn approached, Hipp smiled and saluted her in respect. &quot;Well, I hope this was not all for my visit,&quot; she chuckled and glanced at the amazons, then turned back to Dawn. &quot;I know you must be very proud of your village.&quot; <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>
