His two main commanders rode on either side of him, and the lower commanders behim them. most of the deaths had been counted up it was literally the same amount of which the amazons had...   <br>
 <br>
He had done what he had been sent to do, and now he had a bit of time to do what he wanted, although it semmed clear that he wasn't exactly wanted in these parts.*** <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 501<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/25/01 8:13:14 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/hippster.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: As suddenly as it started.</span><hr size=1> (( alright...everyone..let's rap this topic up.

Unfortantly, her powers had told her of how certain events would occur during the war would play out.  As Hippolyte fell from her horse, Hera bit her teeth and stood firmly upon the hillside.  She knew that Hippolyte would be alright after a few couple months of healing from the wound.  And that the pain and attack were meant to be.  For soon there would be even a greater war, and Hera did not want Hippolyte to be apart of it.  It was going to be a war that only a handful of amazons would return from.  The fewer who went would be better.  <br>
Her cold eyes watched as Pentheslea's face was covered in pain for the death of her sister.  But, Pentheslea's fate was sealed.  There was no turning back.<br>
Many amazons had died this day.  And Hera was very unhappy about that.  The fact the one was killed by her own kind.  That was even more horrid.  Hera watched as DeLerium took her place as the hand of the Fates.  The amazons had enough enemies, without one coming from their own.<br>
As the forces seemed to be pulling back and recovering their wounded and weapons.  Hera dissappeared in a flash of light.  She had a wedding to attend to and hanging out on a battlefield was not the order of the day.<br>
<br>
(( we can play that this was before the wedding.  I will get back with those who asked to play heros oh and Helen in the Trojan War by this thursday.)) <p>~~<<<<<<{{{{@</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.showMessage?topicID=2.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.showMessage?topicID=5.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.emailToFriend?topicID=7.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.threadControl?topicID=7.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/slate/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=7.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=7.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm37">The Mythical Odyssey Forum<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitefrm32">The Mythical Odyssey<option value="amazonsunitefrm35">Amazon Nation Alliance<option value="amazonsunitefrm33">Character Descriptions<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm30">Amazons of the Sacred Circle<option value="amazonsunitefrm34">Amazons of Lesvos Island<option value="amazonsunitefrm38">High Mountain Tiger Clan<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm28">Amazon Sisters of Cremni<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm31">Amazon Language<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32>The Mythical Odyssey</a> <font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
