KEEP IT IN MIND!!!!!!)**<br>
<br>
 Dawn did everything early that night, having turned in after a good night of training. Yep, that was right she was back in Scynthia, helping Wulf on the hard earned assissantion skills of Dawn. <br>
<br>
 Now turned in, she had done everything during her dream, kicked, cursed like a Sailor, rolled, tossed, turned, even fell out of bed. Even now as Dawn flipped to her feet, she was knocked out of sleep, but it had yet to phase her. She shuffled, scurried around pulling on leathers, weapons, crossbows, and boots, slipping out into the night air. <br>
<br>
 Once she found a tree, centered over the area of a were she was lead to believe everything would occur, she settled into a preparation state, going over the dream.<br>
<br>
 One major Queen, a boy, a portal, and fight, a ROMAN FIGHT. That's what caused Dawn to grin, and let the adrenline flow. Watching intently on the sky, and then the ground, Dawn was calm, silent until the sun began to rise...action....<br>
<br>
 Cursing lightly, as the portal open, Dawn tumbled from the tree limb, flipping silently through the air, landing infront of a woman dressed in Crimson. A helmet covered her face, and a war mask covered Dawn's. But both's most apparent Red eyes were seen, and Dawn knew exactly who she was..she was going to be one task Dawn couldn't kill..only injure. <br>
<br>
 So what did Dawn do, you wonder? She let her pass..it was herself..nothing she could do about it. Execpt..<br>
 <br>
 Dawn let out the most fiercest LOUDEST war cry..anyone had ever let out on these lands..they wouldn't hurt her sisters..especially Wulf..<br>
<br>
 Dawn stood, cotemplating..letting them pass by her like she was invisible..until BAM..thoughts interrupted..her she fell to one knee, clasping her arm, itwas sliced open, and she turned drawing two swords. Facing an ALYSIA look alike..Dawn gasped once..stuttering abit before she rolled into her, sweeping her onto the ground...<br>
<br>
 &quot;Forgive me Alysia..&quot;<br>
<br>
 Bringing down the hilt of her sword, she thwapped Aly over the head with it, leaving the Queen unconcious in the rising sun's rayes. Just as she turned Dawn realized how much of a mistake that would turn out to be, she had 20 more ROMANS at her back! They all began to pummel her, leaving her upright next to a tree..unconcious..<br>
<br>
<br>
(P.S. No one attempt to fight Dawn's better half..I'm leaving that one for Jia..and no one wake Dawnie Dawn up..)<br>

Wulf was a called a warning to the village, alerting her. Romans? Alternate universe? She<br>
picked up her swords and ran to a vantage of the Portal, watching for...herself...a chill fell down her spine and she ducked, kicking out and connecting with her knee? The figure fell but she could feel the impact of both hits, they were minor none the less, and she stood shakily, looking down at her attacker. She expected the face, but was stunned still. Her hair was a sharp, contrasting blonde and she was a head shorter. The figure glared up angrily at her and drew her scimtar at the same time as she, using her right hand instead of left.::<br>
