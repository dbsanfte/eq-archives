Heres the Story!!)<br>
<br>
Maytha is in her hut settling a few things when out of no where, The Angel Eli appears in the middle of her hut. &quot;Eli?&quot; Maytha says in suprise to see him. &quot;Yes its me Maytha....how are you?&quot; Eli replyed, giving Maytha a hug. Maytha hugged back in all smiles. &quot;Im great.....so what brings you here?&quot; Maytha asked as they let go in her hug. &quot;Well Maytha, im here to tell you someone bad. I found out a secret, and i think you need to find out&quot; Eli said with sympathy. &quot;Oh great...thats all i need....ok then, spit it out&quot; Maytha said, scared. She sat on her bed and looked at Eli. Eli kneeled in front of her, with sad eyes for Maytha. &quot;Well Maytha, i dont know how to tell you this, so i guess ill tell you straight out. I found out that Ares isnt your father&quot; Eli said, and before he got to continue, maytha said &quot;What?? why do you say that?&quot; Maytha says in suprise. &quot;Maytha....its cause.....::pauses:: borias is your real father. Ares posed as your father to protect you from Hera. It was Artemis's idea. And thats why you suffer so much from Borias's death, cuz you saw your father get killed&quot; Eli said. Maytha shakes her head and tears fall from her eyes. &quot;NO!&quot; she stands. &quot;Thats not true, Artemis wouldnt lie to me like that, no one would.&quot; She said. &quot;Its the truth...this is what really happened. Appartently Borias and Artemis were together one night, one drunken night. Then a month later, Artemis came back to Borias....in the woods not far from his and Xenas camp. she pulled out a child in her arms and said that this was his daughter, but that she couldnt keep her. Cuz if hera found out your father was mortal, You would die. So thats why Ares said he was the father. Hera still hated you, thats why she made you mortal. So thats why Artemis gave You to borias. He raised you in the woods for almost 2 years. He hid you from Xena...so she wouldnt find out about you, he knew she would kill you as well. Then that night, Xena gave birth, you saw him die. Then Kalaipus found you, and raised you. Thats the real truth&quot; Eli finishes. Maytha in a blank stare with tears falling from her face. As she cries, she just cant believe its the truth. &quot;Why did Kalaipus say i was the daughter of Ares then?&quot; She asks. &quot;Because....Borias told Kalipus that if anything happens to him, for him to take care of you and say that Ares was your father for your protection. Since he wont be there to protect you.&quot; Eli Said. Maytha cries. Then Eli tells her what happened that night. &quot;See, When Borias sided with the Centaurs, he had told the Centaurs Xenas plan, and said that he must go back to get Xena and his son out of there, but instead of sending some of the Centaurs with him to fight, he sent the Centaurs in the woods looking for you, saying he had a daughter in hiding. So they went to search for you, but couldnt find you, and when they went to borias, he was already killed. Then Xena gave Solan to Kalaipus, and thats when he found you. And raised you both and did what Borias asked.&quot; Eli explained. Maytha was in disbelief. She looks at Eli with full of tears. &quot;I need to find out if this is true.....im gonna go to the other side to see Borias&quot; Maytha said. Eli shook his head, &quot;I dont think thats a good idea.....&quot; He explained. &quot;I have too....i need too.....&quot; She said. She hugs Eli. &quot;Thanks for telling me the truth....it hurt, but its good to know&quot; She said and lets go. &quot;Your a good friend&quot; She said. &quot;Im sorry this happened&quot; Eli said. &quot;Ill leave, good luck&quot; He said and disappeared. Maytha went to her bowl of water and washed her face. So no one knows in the tribe that she cried. She walks to a scroll, writes in the scroll that she will be gone...and leaves kala in charge of the tribe and Alena. Maytha rolled it up and walked outside. Maytha walked to an amazon. &quot;You...give this scroll to Queen Kala....i need to go on an emergancy Trip&quot; Maytha told the Amazon. &quot;Um....ok Queen Maytha....will you be ok?&quot; The Amazon asked and takes the scroll. &quot;No....but i must go alone...get my horse&quot; Maytha replyed and walked to the stables. Alena comes running to Maytha....&quot;MOMMY!&quot; Alena shouts. Maytha hugs alena and kneels down to her. &quot;Hey sweety...listen, mommy need to go on a trip...ill be back as soon as i can ok? Auntie Kala will watch you while im gone&quot; Maytha told Alena. &quot;Why?&quot; Alena replyed. &quot;Ill tell you later&quot; Maytha said. The Amazon hands Daisy (her horse) to Maytha. Maytha hugs and kisses Alena on the head and says goodbye. Maytha grabs her coat and sees theres supplies on her horse already. She hops on and rides off. Maytha Heads to Greece.<br>
