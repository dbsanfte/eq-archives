The Great Samsara was an ancient Tretmolec of Royal blood. Her Father and Brother were both killed by the Varanas when she was a girl, but the spirit within her gave her strength to move on. Samsara had power in her eyes, but until she left the Tretmolec village after the comming of the Atmah Cyane, she did not realise that the power came from her Mother, The Great Gaia herself.<br>
After she left her Amazon village, she was captured by lizard like people calling themselves Saurians. She was taken to their king who himself was a human but unlike the Varanas she had met and killed before. He was kind and a good man. His name was Ktor. Samsara and Ktor were married under Saurian law and she soon gave birth to a daughter whom she named Karina. <br>
Years later, Karina brought a young man to the Kingdom who turned out to be the son of Kor, of the Varanas. Samsara ordered that Karina never see him again, but Ktor took pity on the boy which caused a large fight between the King and Queen of the Saurians. Karina left with Kinar, son of Kor, and he led her back to the Tretmolec village where his people, along with Saurian allies who had conspired against their king, and they slaughtered the Amazon village.<br>
Samsara knew her daughter was in danger and she left her home in search of her old village. When she arrived she was mistaken that Karina had already been killed. So while she followed Cyane into a hut that was on fire, the Varanas attacked and killed both Amazon Queens. Meanwhile, Karina watched in horror as her mother and village died. Then the Saurians turned on the Varanas killing every last one of them. As they tossed Karina into the pit to devour her, a large white wolf came forth defending the princess. Sadly, both were eventually killed. Ktor was led to believe that Samsara betrayed him, and even in his last moments of life, he declared his hatred for the Tretmolec kind.<br>
<br>
Centuries later, the Atmah Cyane came to a woman called Meg Leandros. She told Meg that her daughter Sayler would soon birth the next Amazon Queen of the Nation and she must protect her for in her, the Nation would be changed for the better. When Sayler gave birth to a baby girl naming her Alysia Lillian Loire, Meg told her that she was the reincarnation of the Goddess Kimbia, an evil darkness that must not leave the amazons protection. While Sayler stayed in Rome with friends, Alysia was raised by Queen Ariah of Ephesus and Queen Genesis Tiberon. She was taught how to fight and healer as well. When she was eleven years old, the village was attacked by a fleet of Romans, where Alysia murdered a Roman general to save her Queen from being killed. After her first kill, she wanted more. She saught out assasins lurking in the woods surrounding Ephesus, and killed them all. Upon her amazon initiation, she was given a sword by Velasca, and the blessing of strength surpassing any man. By Artemis she was given a crossbow, and blessed arrows that only Alysia could remove. And from Athena, she was given the title of &quot;Amazon Goddess of Healing.&quot;<br>

Soon before the birth of their daughter, Joxer abandoned her. Her daughter was stillborn, but she gave her the name  Kora Elena Loire.   <br>
She found little in her life left, so she ventured to Rome to find her Mother. On the way, she met another man named Hercules. His kindness drew her in and sure enough, a child was born. In honor of the love of her first daughter, she called this one Cora Alena Loire. Hercules soon left fearing that Hera would find the girl and kill her. Cora was blessed by the Gods calling her a &quot;Messanger&quot; of the Fates. The Fates came to Aly, telling her to leave Ephesus and go to Rome,for Cora's future was there. She did as was told after the Gods threatened her village.<br>
In Rome she met a woman named Livia and soon fell in love with her. She became Livia's champion and rode with her into battle against many enemies. However, Livia never told Aly of the murders against Amazons and Elisians. <br>
During this time in Alysia's life, the Ancients of the Tretmolecs were conspiring. See, Karina was supposed to be reborn to Samsara, but the Gods interviened and Cora was born instead. Karina was reborn to an amazon named Anya in Rome.<br>
Anya was killed and the baby girl was found by Livia and her Champion Alysia. They took the girl in and raised her as their own naming her Isabella Veronica Krapurs. A Roman name.<br>
After Xena came and took Livia away, Alysia traveled off to find her. Sadly, she returned to Rome without Livia and was told by her army that Rome was attacked and Isabella was killed.<br>
She left Rome in search of her amazon home, but when they saw the mark of Livia on her leathers, she was turned away. Queen Hippolyte of Themiscrya took Alysia in and soon Aly was raised up an amazon once more. She never got over the loss of Livia and Isabella, and buried her anger into drinking. One night at the local tavern, she drank too much and ended up pregnant by a man calling himself Iolaus.<br>
He was called off to war and she was called to Delphi where she was told by the Oracle that her new child would become the next Oracle of Delphi.<br>
Alysia remained in Themiscrya for her pregnancy but Cora was still in Rome and she missed her daughter. She went into labor in the Roman palace, and gave birth to the next Oracle of Delphi, naming her Aliya Gabrielle Loire.<br>
However, there was another. Aliya had a twin sister. Alysia named her, Alexa Xena Loire.<br>
Alysia returned to Themiscrya and trained her girls there as well as in Ephesus where she was welcomed back. The girls were both developing powers, and were aged quickly to assist in their development. Aliya became more of a peacemaker, and Alexa a warrior and inventor. Sadly, because of Alysia's selfishness, she lost connection between herself and Alexa. <br>
Aliya remained in Ephesus, as well as Delphi and Rome. The Goddess Artemis then impregnated Aliya with a child who was named Melody Nicola Loire, Roman Goddess of Music.<br>
Cora too, was wed to a man named Alastor Alcon. Cora in turn gave birth to a boy naming him, Julian Alastor Alcon. Alysia and Alastor never got along, and both knew it well.<br>
During the same time as Julain was born, Alysia gave birth to a boy who she called, Wulf Heracles Loire.<br>
Wulf was killed early on in life and through Dawnithinia Rivent Darkshade's daughter, he was brought back to life thus becomming Alysia and Dawn's son.<br>
After Wulf was born, Cora gave birth to a little girl naming her Odessa Sayler Alcon.<br>
Alysia herself raised the girl in Scynthia, where Alysia was Amazon Queen.<br>
Alysia eventually met a man of the Elisians, his name was Eli. She was married to him and gave birth to a girl naming her Vyiana Cyane Loire. A dark power erased most memory of Eli and Vyi from her mind, and Alysia retreated back to Scynthia.<br>

Eventually she ended up at a riverbank where Alysia happened to be fishing one day with her sister Gabrielle. She figured out who the girl was, and took her back to Scynthia where she adopted her and made her Princess of Scynthia.<br>
<br>
Not too long after, Alysia's destiny played out as Samsara and Alysia became one in spirit and sometimes body. It also turned out that Belle was Samsara's daughter Karina. Mother and Daughter were once again reunited and have a bond stronger than any.<br>
<br>
Belle finally changed her name to: Isabella-Karina Evanda-Loire<br>
Evanda, after her biological Father, Aaron Evanda. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right
