&quot;Ah....Son of  A Bacchae!&quot; She waves her hands around trying to get rid of the nasty looking smoke.<br>
<br>
This broad is wearing a black battle dress with leopard print,knee high boots,arm bands and gauntlets matching the dress. She has a sword at her back,which these days rarely comes into use. Has blonde hair,pretty tall,big bust,somewhat muscular. She looks like that Mavican broad,and she blames that on her parents. (lol)<br>
<br>
She makes her way around the tribe. &quot;Oh,amazons...gotta....luv em...&quot; She giggles,then looks around.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lillllllllaaaaa!&quot; She calls out for the erm,Queen of the tribe,in a sing song voice. <br>
<br>
Looking around. &quot;Anyone seen my future sis in-law? Hmmmm Anyone? Hello?&quot; Looks around more. &quot;Lillllaaaa? Where are you??&quot;<br>

This tiger differed too from the rest in other attributes. His eyes were that of a wolf.<br>
<br>
He bowed his head in respect of the woman. He had been taught from birth that woman were above him while in amazon lands unless stated by the Queen of that tribe.<br>
<br>
He then spoke to her telepathically.<br>

She looked at him strangely again. &quot;Oh..&quot; Scratches her head. Then tries that telepathic thing.<br>
<br>
~I don't speak amazon. Why are you a tiger? Where is Lilla?~ Phoebe knew some amazons words,cause around anywhere basically,everyone seemed to be an amazon,hehe;but regardless,she still didn't know enough,and didn't want this Wulf tiger to start speaking a bunch of amazon language that she didn't know.<br>
<br>
She telepathically spoke somemore.<br>
<br>
~I'm Phoebe,Goddess of Misfortune...~ She took a breath,as though she were going to continue with a longer title,so she could sound important,but frankly,thats all there was to it when it came to titles. Huff. She just continues with a simple statement.<br>
<br>
~Lilla is spose to be marrying my lil bro,so I want to meet her,to see if she's good enough for my bro.~ She placed her hands on her hips,looking a little serious. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ulillaanndarkshade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lilla Ann Darkshade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#939393>(10/5/02 9:15:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Then This is Her.</span><hr size=1>  (Sorry for taking so long.

<br>
 &quot;That's good, though. Our numbers are stable, not large, but stable, and that's good. We're start recruiting really soon.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Lilla nodded, before stepping out of the Queen's Hut. It was obvious Lilla had been in a meeting, but felt the real need to step out. <br>
<br>
 She was somewhat of a simple looking girl, well, for the amazon types that were in the nation, she fit in well, and looked alot like her mother. <br>
<br>
 Blonde hair seemed to fall and frame her face, and dark brown eyes glistened lightly in the sun as she made her way to Wulf and Phoebe. She was average, not strong, not weak, just enough to defend herself. She was dressed with a long black leather skirt, knee high deer skin boots, a black corsit. She didn't seem the warrior type.<br>
<br>
 ~&quot;Wulf? I thought I might be needed here..&quot;~<br>
<br>
 She glanced with a welcoming smile to Phoebe, before saluting her in the amazon fashion she had been taught, and then extended her hand, which glimmered lightly with her engagement ring from Blake. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uphoebegoddessofmisfortune.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Phoebe Goddess of Misfortune</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#939393>(10/6/02 2:49:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> And there she is...</span><hr size=1> She turned her attention from Wulf to Lilla.<br>
<br>
Hands were still placed on hips as she let her eyes look Lilla up and down,from head to toe.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yer Lilla,aint ya? Blake aint said nothin about you,but news gets around.&quot; <br>
<br>
She kinda ignored the amazon salute,since she wasn't an amazon,nor had no real desire to know them,but since her bro was marrying one,she'd be as peachy as possible.<br>
<br>
She suddenly grabs Lilla's hand,and pulls it closer to eye the ring.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is THIS the engagement ring?&quot; She bit back a giggle. &quot;Oh mah lord,Blake sure didn't pitch out too much money for that one! Ha!&quot; She looked Lilla in the eyes. Then suddenly blinked,and put on her best 'sorry' expression. &quot;I mean....it's the thought that counts though....right?&quot; Pat pats Lilla's hand before releasing it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,I can say one thing, Blake can sure choose 'em!&quot; She laughed shortly. Then smirked. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 418<br> <font color=#939393>(10/6/02 11:03:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Remaining Silent.</span><hr size=1>  Lilla stayed silent, her eyes staying as steady as possible upon Phoebe. She wasn't going to insult the woman, and she was being slightly.. well.. demeaned. It was no time to make rifts in a family she had yet to become apart of.<br>
<br>
 Finally she spoke, the hand that had been examined gently running through the fur on Wulf.<br>
<br>

<br>
She crosses her arms over her busty chest,and shifts her weight from one foot to the other. &quot;Do I NEED  a reason to visit my future sis in-law?&quot; She said,a slight cocky tone,one brow raising. <br>
<br>
&quot;YOU are the reason.&quot; She said,as she then reached a hand out and poked Lilla in the chest,then she re-crossed her arms over her chest.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ya see,i've been pre-occupied for quite awhile,and so far my other bro got hitched,and now Blake is,so I kinda want to meet the people who are entering the lives of my siblings that way I can determine whether or not I wanna continue to hang around...otherwise..I just got more important things to be doing.&quot; <br>
<br>
She looks at the invisable wrist hourglass (watch) on her right wrist,sighs then looks back at Lilla.<br>
<br>
&quot;And times a waistin. So whats it gonna be;silent boring Lilla with no personal interest for me,or are yah going to lighten up and tell me a few things about you?&quot;<br>
<br>
At this point,Phoebe couldn't be more serious about what she was saying,if she wasn't going to be welcomed among 'family' then she had other plans else where.<br>
