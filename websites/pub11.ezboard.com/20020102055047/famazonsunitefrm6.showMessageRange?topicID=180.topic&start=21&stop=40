She suddenly had a bad feeling. A certain concern for her children. Wulf and Belle. . . Gods no. .. she thought.<br>

As she rode a bit forward next to her athelfi, a new sword was seen on her back. Beautiful craftmanship of Hepheastus. With Amazon design on the hilt. It was Lynxia's. Genesis had loaned it to Aly for this war. <br>

 Looking like a rag doll as she rode atop her dog Scooby,Evelyn clings to him tightly,while trying desparatly not to drop her wooden sword.&quot;Sco-o-o-ob-y....sl-o-o-w-....do-o-own!&quot;She pleads with her dog,but that darn dog keeps darting in an out of the obsticles that were infront of him.<br>
<br>
Then suddenly,Evelyn and Scooby are swept up onto a tiger!Too startled to scream,shes can only squeek,while Scooby lets out a grunt as he is picked up,then a growl,but he too is too startled to react.<br>
<br>
Evelyns eyes go wide as suddenly they are taken into a green light thing,and she then quickly closes her eyes,and wraps her arms around Scoobys neck,and if you can picture it,Scooby acctually enjoys the ride,like a dog hanging from the window of a [car].<br>
<br>
And as they are transported to wherever it is they are,Evelyn looks up at Del as she speaks.Though Del's words werent quite reassuring,her smile was,and Evelyn relaxes a bit,and though her and Scooby had a 'sitting spell' on them,she continued to cling to Scooby,and still miraculously she had her wooden sword.<br>
<br>
Looking up at Del.&quot;Im a Amazon!I can beat up all the bad guys.&quot;She nods quite a few times,as she looks at Del as if she were in a trance at how strong and brave looking the amazon looked.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamazonbelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AmazonBelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#993300>(8/22/01 10:21:01 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> XVH Enters the War</span><hr size=1> ((::Stares, blinking at how many posts she missed seeing and chances to reply from not checking the ezboard today, that scoots IC::))<br>

Belle just sighed softly as she listened to her brother and her best friend talk, eyes locked before her on her athelfi and their destination.<br>
<br>
The usually talkative girl hadn't said a word since she, Wulf, and Cyane had left their camping trip. She couldn't manage. <br>
<br>
She gathered herself, and her mixed emotions, just enough to shoot Cy a gentle, confident smile.<br>

She wears a sword on a sheath on her back, one at her side and daggers are sheathed in numerous places, hidden and out in the open. She wears Ephesian war paint on her face and arms.<br>
     From person to person she glances, recognizing most of the Amazons, with a few new faces until finally she spots Alysia and runs over to her.<br>

<br>
Getting tired of grasping her wooden sword,she slips it into the small belt around her waist.She then glances up at Delilah,then looks around again.Her eyes stopping when she sees Ariah pass by.&quot;Ariah!&quot;She yells,but it would probley be unheared with the noise of all the horses trotting around.And she pointed to Ariah as she looked up again at Delilah.<br>

<br>
She noticed to whom the girl was pointing. &quot;Yes... LaTra Ariah. Noble and brave,&quot; saying it loud enough for Evelyn to hear over the galloping horses. &quot;Here Evelyn, drink this. Don't want you dehydrated.&quot; She held out a wineskin full of cold, thirst-quenching water that happened to materialize in Delilah's grasp out of.. thin air. &quot;We'll be there very soon and I mustn't have you thirsty. Hold onto the wineskin and drink when needed. I will have you hidden some place safe nearby. You may not feel very fond of war after this one. I assure you, if you don't want to watch when it happens, you may close your eyes and sleep. Trust me.. you'll be fine.&quot; Her warm smile was reassuring, though her thoughts were on other things.<br>
<br>
This ride certainly wasn't a bumpy one since her tiger's sprint was very much like a glide, quite comfortable. She reached out and patted Scooby's head. &quot;You have a good companion, little girl.&quot; She clicked her tongue and her tiger sped up just a bit more. The tiger didn't look like it'd be getting tired anytime soon.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you get hungry, just say so.&quot; And with that they kept on riding at the front of the army of Amazons galloping forward towards the battle... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ulatraariah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LaTra Ariah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#993300>(8/23/01 12:10:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: O.o</span><hr size=1> Ariah blinked abit and twirled around.
