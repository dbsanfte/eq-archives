Her horse was being very careful not to lose it's injured passenger which meant that it was hardly moving any faster than a slow trot. Lara looked around at the surroundings through a swollen eye. Though she'd only visited the amazon tribe in these parts once before she knew that she was getting closer to the village and was very thankful. Wincing at the shooting pain in her wrist as she shifted her weight in her saddle she makes a quick inspection of herself, knowing that she must look terrible, covered in bruises and cuts and and carrying what she believes to be a broken wrist.<br>
<br>
L: oh well it serves me right...i should have been more focused<br>
<br>
Lara had left her own tribe back at Hyrcania a few days ago needing to be alone and have some time to think. After a day or two on the road she realised that if she continued in the direction she was headed she would reach the village of the Sisters of Honour. Having not seen her sister Rhiannon for a while Lara continued on knowing that she would be welcomed by her sister's tribe.<br>
<br>
It was further back down the road to Marpesia, out of amazon territory, that Lara was ambushed by some raiders. As her mind was on other things she had completely missed hearing their sneaking up on her and surprise attack. Although she had beaten them in the end it had taken a few seconds for her to realise what was happening and she had been wounded pretty bad.<br>
<br>
Lara sighed remembering her mistake, knowing that the consequences could have been much worse. She shifts her weight again trying to get comfortable, hoping she will reach the village soon so that she can see the healer.<br>
<br>
After a few more minutes of slow progress Lara starts to feel really dizzy and nauseous as her wounds are really starting to take their toll on her body. Lara can almost swear she can hear the sounds of a fast approaching horse but the ringing in her ears makes it hard to identify from which direction it may be coming. All of a sudden an intense shooting pain spreads over her back as an arrow from behind lodges itself in her. Lara can hear someone calling her name but as she starts to pass out she has trouble recognising the familiar voice...could it be Connor, but he was all the way back near Hyrcania...?<br>
<br>
As Lara slumps over unconscious in her saddle Connor's cry of anguish can be heard behind as he slowly gains on the lone raider that is nearing Lara with his bow raised once again to deliver a shot that will finish her off and avenge his fallen friends. Just as he is about to draw the string Connor rides up beside him and cuts off his head in one strike, killing the raider instantly before he could do any more harm. <br>
<br>
Connor quickly dismounts and runs to Lara's side obviously fearing the worst by the tears streaming down his face. Although he is overwhelmed at first that she is still alive his fear returns as he realises she is slowly dieing.<br>
<br>
C: come on Lara wake up!...dont leave me please!...dammit this is all my fault!<br>
<br>
He carefully climbs up into the saddle behind her being extremely careful not to knock the arrow that is in her back and holds her tight around the waist with one arm and grasps the reigns with the other. He kicks the horse into a gallop and takes off down the road in search of a village, being a man from a foreign area he of course didnt know that an amazon tribe lived in this area and didnt realise that their village was so close. What he definately wasnt counting on was that he was nearing the amazon tribe who's queen happened to have a great disliking of him.<br>
