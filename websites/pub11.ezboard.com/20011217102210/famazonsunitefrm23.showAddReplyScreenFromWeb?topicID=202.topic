The sandy beach reflects the glare of the sun from the partially clouded sky and violent waves beat upon the shore. The smell of salt mixed with the smell of newly washed grass fills the air. Grey mists spring forth from the ground and a shadowy form stands in its thickness. The mist slowly fades from Poseidon as he looks at the shores of the beach. The long grass brushes his muscular legs when a soft gust of wind passes by. A lock of hair falls into his eyes and he brushes it away with a graceful movement of the hand. His strong bare feet fall lightly on the blades of grass that crush under his weight. Crickets play their music in the grass and Poseidon walks away from the sea and looks up at a small village in the meadow not too far from the sea. There is a blue and black bruise on his shoulder and silk bandages on his hands. A golden crown lies on his brown curls and a smile draws itself onto his fair face. A short white toga fastened with gold clips conceal the trunk of his body and his upper legs. White stoned pillars and houses reflect in his blue eyes  and the sound of water crashing down on water and flowing back in on itself echoes in the meadow.:: <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uposeidonkofc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poseidonkofc</A> at: 11/26/01 10:00:16 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uposeidonkofc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poseidonkofc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 238<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(11/27/01 10:45:01 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.tripod.com/~Poseidon64/poseidon3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Aftermath</span><hr size=1> ::His skin and shape shifts to that of a young, poor-looking mortal. He has slighty dark skin, brown eyes and short cropped black hair. The form he assumes is scrawny and he wears rags and his small, dirty feet are bare. The town is bustling with people. Fruit and clothes stands line the walls of the houses. People shout over each other to be heard. Carriages and carts with goods for bartering drawn by asses creak down the town lanes. Poseidon bumps into a thick set short man rushing by him and falls to the ground with a grunt. The man looks back at him and hurries along to wherever he was going not bothering to help him. He gets up and rubs a small scar that is on his elbow. Hundreds of faces look down into the streets from upstairs apartments and washed clothes are hung from clothes lines that extend from roof to roof. Poseidon notices a stand in which the merchant is selling small statues of their god Poseidon and other accessories that deal with the god. He smiles at his pleasure and walks over to a wall that is not crowded with people in an empty ally. He leans back on the wall near the ally opening with his hands in his pockets and one ankle crossed over the other.:: <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uposeidonkofc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poseidonkofc</A> at: 12/2/01 1:59:17 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uposeidonkofc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poseidonkofc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 245<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(12/2/01 1:56:33 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://web.uvic.ca/grs/bowman/myth/images/haifa/h89.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Aftermath</span><hr size=1> ::A man with short hair, like Poseidon's, green eyes and tanned skin with a wiry frame walked up to Poseidon from the crowd. The god ignored the oncoming man and looked into the faces of others that passed by here and there. The man stepped a few feet in front of him and his face was grim and hard. From his pants pocket the man drew forth a blade that shone bright in keen in the sun. Yellowed and cracked teeth were seen in the mans mouth as he quickly jumped up on Poseidon and pinned him to the wall with the blade pointing at his gut. Poseidon looked up into the mans eyes and the man dropped his blade and fell back in horror. He'd seen something in the boys eyes which was not normal and it burned his eyes as the boy looked at him. The man tried to crawl away but to no avail, the land opened from under him and swallowed him. The mans screams were heard by no one in the crowed, in fact nobody had seen anything that went on between Poseidon in the guise of a boy and the man.:: <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uposeidonkofc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poseidonkofc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 247<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(12/2/01 4:05:04 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://web.uvic.ca/grs/bowman/myth/images/haifa/h89.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Aftermath</span><hr size=1> ::With his nimble hands in the pockets of his tattered trousers the god decides to move on. This part of the town seems to have passed the test, there were few gangs, rogue villians and the such. He stepped oout of the shodowed ally into the brights sun which was blotted out for a few minutes when thick clouds passed it by. A breeze was starting to pick up and peoples garments were blowing and sand and dust bagan to fill the air. He walked down the zig-zag streets down to the town center. A lot of middle-class folked lived here and people barely payed him any mind as he walked by them. <br>
<br>
<br>
When he had reached the town center after turning a corner on which a traveling circus was closed for the day he spotted a temple dedicated to Poseidon. It was a small temple, not extravagant and there were no guards seen because of the low crime rate there. The temple was circular and made of timber. It was just one story high and the curved dome had a few holes on top from which light poured in. A bronze double-door that could be easily moved on its hinges led to the temple, this was the only entrance or exit. Along the exterior were more windows that depicted scenes of life in the town. <br>
<br>
<br>
He walked through the heavy doors which swung shut behind him. The interior was filled with incence and the floors were made of polished stone. Many alters filled the room and at the end was an opening that had no door which led to the rooms of the priests who lived there. Before that door was the largest alter upon which sacrifices were made with the whle town. The alters were just rectanglar slabs of stone set on four short, thick legs of stone. Torches stuck out from the walls and only a few were lighted. The rest would be put to light when it got darker. A few people of the town were kneeling before alters chanting prayers and some leving offerings. A priest, robed in white from the neck down stared at the boy as he entered. He arms were crossed in the long sleeves of his robe and his long red hair came down over his face. The boy walked quietly looking at each man and woman there and walked up to the priest. The priest looked down at the boy and smled at him.::<br>
<br>
Priest: 'Good afternoon child. Its a good day and hopefully a good one to you, do you need any help with anything.'<br>
<br>
Boy: 'No, I'm just a visitor from afar and I came to look at the temple. Is this a temple of Poseidon?'<br>
<br>
Priest: 'Yes, this towns patron god is Poseidon and all over the island he is worshipped. '<br>
<br>
::Another older looking priest walked from outside the back room and and whispered something to the red-haired priest. The older priest the walked away from the red-haired man who nodded to him.::<br>
<br>
Priest: 'If you'll excuse me I need to attend something real quick. We have to set up for the ceremony tonight in which the whole town will be participating. Why don't you come over tonight and join.'<br>
<br>
Boy: 'Alright I'll do that. I'll see you later on then.'<br>
<br>
Priest: 'Okay, I'll be seeing you around.'<br>
<br>
::The priest walked away and Poseidon smiled being pleased with what he saw. He walked out of the temple and when he was outside ran into the street. He disappeared from the island and set forth on to go to another.::<br>

Lush greenery, plants and pine forests dominate the scene. Off in the villages men work in the fields. The city of Mytilini is crowded and labour is at its peak. From thin air appears a fish tavern and Poseidon is its owner. A middle-aged man with cracked skin and a leathery face. He has excited grey eyes and greying hair that is parted in the middle and comes down to his ears. People crowd into the tavern as if it were always there and it fills up quickly with customers as the harbor is a busy place during the day. Orders are taken care of by non-existant servants created by Poseidon. He sits on a wooden stool behind the long counter that is made of wood from the forests that are in and around the village. He quickly places cups on the counter and pours drinks and works as a normal bartender would. Men and women who do all kinds of work such as fishing, carpentry, architecture and farming come to eat and relax. Many come to talk to friends they have known for many years. A man comes up to the counter and smells of oils and fish. His gollashes and clothes are damp and pugnant. He orders some fried fish and after telling a servant the order leans on the counter and starts conversation with the man.::<br>
<br>
Pos- 'You look like your hard at work.'<br>
<br>
Man- 'Yes,that be true mate. The fish are rolling in like locusts in the harvest.'<br>
<br>
Pos- 'I'd think you'd have enough of fish, being around them all day.'<br>
<br>
Man- 'Naw, I love fish, and praise be to Poseidon. He give us good day, today.'<br>
<br>
A customer asks for some milk and Poseidon quickly excuses himself from the man to take care of the order. He hands the glass of milk to the man and turns back to the fisherman.<br>
<br>
Pos- Excuse me, so is Poseidon worshipped widely.'<br>
<br>
Man- Certainly mate. He be the god of our island, if it were'nt for him we'd have no food source to keep us sustained.<br>
<br>
The man's order is set before him and he takes up his utnsils and eats his food.<br>
<br>
Man- Why u askin and all?<br>
<br>
Pos- I hear that the people all across this island neglect his worship and turn the lord of the seas from their hearts.<br>
<br>
Man(mouth full of food)- Well ya hear wrong. We done worshipped and loved Poseidon from the beginin and we are gonna keep on reverin' him till tha end.'<br>
<br>
Pos- Thats good to hear and well said for the people of this island. <br>
<br>
The man finishes and pushes his plate away. He wipes his greasy face with a napkin and finishes his drink. He walks away to the exit and yells over the clamour of the crowd.<br>
<br>
Man- Be seein ya mate, and Poseidon's been good to you too.<br>
<br>
Poseidon waves at the man and watches him leave. Another customer comes up and he takes the orders and gives them out when they arrive.:: <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uposeidonkofc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poseidonkofc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 259<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(12/15/01 1:07:31 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://web.uvic.ca/grs/bowman/myth/images/haifa/h89.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lesvos</span><hr size=1> The day has ended and night creeps across the land. The shadows lengthen and the city dies down. The fish tavern is finally empty. Poseidon sits back in the round stool behind the counter with his back to the wooden wall. Exhaustion has got to him from the long days work and from assuming this shape for so long. He rises and walks through the closed door without opening it. Sparks fly off the door from his passing and outside the tavern the night is warm with a nice cool breeze and the sky is clear and full of stars and the sickle moon. Over by the docks rustling can be heard from ship carpenters still at work and sailors laughing and getting drunk on their ships. Walking along the dock alone Poseidon walks into one of the ships. Rugged men are drinking and clouds of smoke from pipes float across the ship. He takes up with the men for the night and parties along with them waiting for the morning. <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFF33>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#FFFF33> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23>The Olympian Gods</a> <font color=#FFFF33> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#FFFF33> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
