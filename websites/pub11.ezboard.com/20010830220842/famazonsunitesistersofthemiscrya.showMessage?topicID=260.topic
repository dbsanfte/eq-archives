She walked back into her hut a bit drained from the past days of traning a few initiates, hunting, and keeping busy at the Temple of Hera. She decided that she was going to stop running around and spend some quality time with herself and her sisters for once. Velaska changed out of her leather armour and slipped on her black chemise, she grabbed a towle and a book she was given by a worshipper of hera who she had met in the temple .She then walked out of her hut and over to the stabbles. On her way in, she fed one of Hippolyte's mares a carrot then walked over to her black mare moonshine. She fed moonshine an apple as she placed her towel and book into a back sattchel and onto he rback, she then removed the heavy saddle of the horse and placed it aside. She unhitched her, and pet the shiny main on her mare, she then jumped up and locked her legs around the beast, she then rod bareback down the road leading to the lakes and springs.She spotted DeL and waved to her as they past on the road. She directed Moonshine to one of Themsicrya's most beautiful springs of fresh water and dismounted. She lay her blanket out and layed down getting herself comfortable, then opened her book and began to read~*~* <p>Amazon Velaska ..

Most of them thought themselved untouchable, she scoffed at the idea...anyone could be stopped, may it be death or destruction..That was part of the reason Velaska became human again.
