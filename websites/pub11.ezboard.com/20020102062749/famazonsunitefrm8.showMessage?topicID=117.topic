She sighs saddly as she sat outside her Sarmatia hut nursing her new baby girl,Brook. So much had happened since she left Smyrna to go fight in a war that never took place. And she figured it was about time she returned to Smyrna and got the tribe back on pace,she couldn't imagine how inactive her tribe would be,and she didn't blame anyone but herself,she's neglected her tribe for too long.<br>
<br>
Once Brook finished feeding,Kala covers herself then stands up and rests Brook on her shoulder and lightly pats her back until she let out a healthy burp. Kala then walks into her hut and glances around,wondering where Trinity might be,and with a shrugg she moves over to the wooden crib which she crafted herself and lays Brook down on the soft furs in the crib. "Sleep well Brook,we're gonna have a long trip ahead of us." She whispers quietly to Brook who is laying on her stomach and who drifts off to sleep.<br>
<br>
After laying Brook down for a nap,Kala moves over to a wooden chest which held some of her belongings. She opens the chest and grabs out the warm clothing she had brought with her from Smyrna,to Scynthia and now Sarmatia. The wheather was becoming quite chilly and these would come in handy for the trip. She then gets her leather traveling pack and places the clothing in the pack,then two blankets,and a toy or two for Brook. She then walks over to the hut door and opens it and stops a young amazon just as she was passing by.<br>
<br>
"Hey,hi....sorry if your'e busy but I need to ask you to do me a favor....if you would?"<br>
<br>
- Amazon - " Not busy at all,what can I do for you,Kala?"<br>
<br>
Kala smiles lightly. "Great,could you watch my daughter,Brook for me? I need to go get some stuff,it'll only take me a few minutes."<br>
<br>
- Amazon - "Sure,no problem,I love kids."<br>
<br>
"Kool beans,thanks so much." Kala smiled once again. "Brooks in her crib,sleeping so she shouldn't be a problem." With that Kala hurries out to get some more supplies.<br>
<br>
After a few minutes,Kala returns to her hut carrying some supplies she'll need for the trip. She nudges her hut door open,and steps inside,and looks to the amazon who's humming a lulaby to Brook. Kala smiles and walks over to the bed and sets the stuff down before looking back to the amazon. "Thanks,I appreciate your help." She spoke a little quietly so not to disturb sleeping Brook. " And if you can do me another favor?"<br>
<br>
- Amazon - "Sure,no problem. What else?"<br>
<br>
" Can you find Trinity for me? She's a new amazon here,you might have seen her. She tall,good looking......" Spaces off for a moment,then blinks..." Anyways,if you can find her for me,please? That would be great." She smiles quickly and goes to packing the supplies in her traveling pack.<br>
<br>
- Amazon - Quirks a brow,then nods. "Sure not a problem. I've seen her." With that the amazon hurries out of the hut and wanders the village to find Trinity. <p>|•| Kala of Smyrna |•|</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ukalaofsmyrna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kala of Smyrna</A> at: 11/6/01 12:18:38 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=trinityfirestorm69>TrinityFirestorm69</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#8A2BE2>(11/6/01 11:44:29 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Packing up....</span><hr size=1> ::Trinity was out doing her routine check-up on the village, since she did get to know the place rather well and so quickly, she was just making sure everything was in order and no fighting was going on::<br>

You don't have to go with me when I go,but once I get things on track in Smyrna again,and I arrange for Brooks ritual and the celebration of the new life in Smyrna,I would like you to be there.
