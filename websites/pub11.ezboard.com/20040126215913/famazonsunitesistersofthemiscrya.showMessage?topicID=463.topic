Her emerald eyes darted to her left as she sensed someone watching.  Without another thought, she had ducked against a large tree, waiting for the figure of the amazon to pass.  She did not want to be challenged in the forest.  <br>
<br>
As soon as the figure of the amazon passed, the muscular blonde, slipped out of the edge of the forest and into the clearing.  She walked swifty to the shadows, hugging each hut as if it were her life line, and watching for those who might detect her sooner than she intended to be detected.  She continued this progression until she was within site of the queen's hut.  She slowly took off the cloak and stepped out fulling into the light of the day.   <br>

One of them, not recognizing the princess quickly moved her spear across in guard of the curtained door.  But, the other older amazon did recognize Princess Gabrielle.  Seeing the amazon throw up a spear to protect the queen, the older knocked the spear out of the way.   And then whispered, &quot;It is the princess Gabrielle.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her spear knocked from the door, the younger amazon quickly stood up straight  as her partner did on the other.  Both amazons took the edge of the curtain in hand and parted it before the princess reached the steps.<br>
<br>

<br>
The hut was silent and quiet.  Not much had changed inside, the rooms still seperated by the long curtains embroidered with peacock feather designs.  In the great room sat the large peacock statue and altar to Hera.  Small blue and white candles lit around and above the small basin of water and mirror before it.   Hippolyte sat alone mending a bit of leather armour on an embroidered rug below it.  Her fingers nimbling sewing leather thread between the pieces.   <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

<br>
Her breath caught in her throat as she caught site of Hippolyte for the first time in many seasons.  &quot;By the gods...&quot;  She froze in the doorway, wanting to run to her, to embrace her, but she waited for some signal that it was acceptable to do so after all this time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hippolyte>Hippolyte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 854<br> <font color=#993300>(4/22/03 11:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=463.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/Hippwknife1ezboard.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Entering the Hut of the Queen</span><hr size=1> Hippolyte had heard the curtains move and the light change in the front room.

After a few hours of work, Hipp was pretty calm.<br>

Then she heard the voice that Hippolyte had decided she would never hear.  She quickly got up from the floor, pushing her armour aside and now stood.  There before her was Gabrielle.  A lump hit her throat that she could not swallow.  <br>

Looking over Gabrielle made Hippolyte tremble inside.  But, she was steel on the outside.  Her years had taught her so.  Especially the year that Gabrielle had left to be with Xena again.<br>

&quot;Anything you need just let me know, and I will make sure you get it.&quot;<br>

Hipp took a breath, turning her eyes to the peacock statue not too far from her.  Like she was trying to pull from it whatever strength she could.  It was always known that Hippolyte's heart had belonged to Gabby. But, for the last year, Hippolyte had fought that feeling.  To no success it seemed.<br>

Gabrielle took a deep breath, &quot;Hippolyte, my destiny is with you.  It always has been and it always will be no matter where I go, my heart will always belong to you.&quot;  Aphrodite had joined them together all those seasons ago and it was the blessing of the goddess that had brought her home again to her love. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hippolyte>Hippolyte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 868<br> <font color=#993300>(4/25/03 9:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=463.topic&index=14>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/Hippwknife1ezboard.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Absence of Love?</span><hr size=1> &quot;And what you feel for Xena?

Hippolyte walked over to Gabrielle and stood in front of her gazing into both her green orbs.  &quot;We can begin again.&quot; Then she glanced away, still afraid of being lost in those eyes again.  &quot;I can have a room made for you here in my hut, or a seperate hut all together.&quot;  She then turned her eyes back to Gabrielle.  &quot;It is up to you.&quot; <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

Yet, her eyes were looking away.  Her fingers gently looped inside Gabby's, and then gave a slight tug of the princess towards her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td
