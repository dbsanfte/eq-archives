&quot;Alright, spill it.&quot;<br>

The amazon loosened up a little bit. &quot;My Queen, there is a woman at the gates, she is an amazon, and wishes to speak with you. She says her name is Solari&quot;<br>
<br>
At the mention of Solari's name, Rhiannon grinned. She remembered her from a previous meeting, and considered the woman a friend. <br>

She immediately got up and rushed out to the gate to welcome Solari to her tribe.<br>

 &quot; It is good to see you again, Rhiannon.... I had a pleasant ride here. I came to ask about the tribe we spoke about. As you know, certain land issues are what concerns Hippolyte and myself, and I assured her that we can all come to an agreement to where everyone would be at peace with it.<br>
 I know that my reputation as being a fair amazon, has yet to reach you. But my word is solid and true. When I was queen so long ago, I was a fair one. Of course, I was also a little quicker to fight than I am now. I tend to pick those fights that are worthy of being fought.&quot; <br>
 Solari followed her friend back into the Main Hall. She glanced around and smiled softly. <br>
 &quot;The only things I can think we need to discuss are the issues of land and things of that nature. But, Let us get to that later, If you would please humor me, a tour of your villiage. &quot; And with that she smiled softly, but proudly at her friend. ~<br>

She exited the Main Hall and headed for the outskirts of the village.<br>
Rhia started with the Stables, the tribe's pride and joy. &quot;We breed the finest horses in the Nation. We're currently working out a trade agreement with Chadesia. Metalwork for horseflesh.&quot; Rhiannon seemed delighted by the idea. <br>
<br>
She'd been a bit skeptical at first, with Marpesia being so isolated from most of the rest of the tribes. But with the trade agreement, and with her going back and forth between Marpesia and Hyrcania so much, they were starting to get alot more visitors of late. <p><center> <img src = "http://user.netomia.com/angelkim/rhia.png"><br>

 &quot;They are indeed fine horses.&quot; She said as she patted one of them. &quot;The amazons are great warriors, having great horses sweetens the pot.&quot; <br>
  She whistled for her mare to join her. As her mare trotted over, the black mane flowed gently in the breeze. Solari gently rubbed the soft muzzle and reached into her pouch for a treat. <br>
 &quot;As you see, I also own a very fine horse. She came to me when I was traveling outside the nation. Her breed is called andalusian. The breed come from a land where the people speak a language that strange, but beautiful. I learned a good bit of it on my stay there. But I will admit, that you do have good tastes in horses.&quot; Solari smiled at her friend. &quot; A trade agreement is a wise idea.&quot; <br>
  Solari listened intently as her friend spoke of the horses and trade route. She was happy to hear of new ideas and thoughts from someone so young. It made her reminise about her own youth. She continued to follow her friend through the villiage.~ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/urhiannonmerai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rhiannon Mer ai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#993300>(9/8/02 10:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm55.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.absolutely.net/hannigan/ah26.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ~A Visitor~</span><hr size=1> Rhiannon led the way to the next building, a small brick affair that was set next to a spring that forked off from the river nearby.

<br>
As they passed, she pointed out the vastness of the pastures. Even though it had begun snowing higher up in the mountians, and indeed, there was even some snow in the village, the grass was still green from the Summer. <br>
<br>
She kept walking, and they eventually ended up at the Dining Hall. <br>

She was a little tired from her trip, but nothing out of the ordinary. Solari had good stamina, that came from her younger days as a fighting warrior and having to ride for days following and fighting the enemy. She would rest soon enough, but did welcome the breather. <br>
 &quot;My friend....I have come to the decision that I would once again like to revive SCS. You offered me that postion once before and I replied that I would have to talk it over with Hippolyte. Well, I have talked it over with her. She is okay with the idea. But has some concerns as to how the land will be divided, seeing as your tribe has now claimed the mountains.&quot; She paused momentarily before continuing.... &quot; I did assure her that we could come to an agreement that everyone would be happy with. &quot;<br>
 Solari then asked where she could find a goblet of water and hid a small yawn.~<br>

I am sure we can come to some sort of agreement, however.&quot;<br>
<br>
The young Queen was sure her nervousness showed. This was her first attempt at negotiations, and while she had seen her father do this many times, it felt different doing it herself.  <p><center> <img src = "http://user.netomia.com/angelkim/rhia.png"><br>

 &quot; My only concerns are the lands. I do not want to trend on anyone's territory, nor do I want to divide the amazons. My friend and Queen Hippolyte has the same concern. So what do you propose on this issue? &quot; <br>

<br>
She unrolled it, and revealed a map of the Caucasus Mtns. She pinned the sides down to the table, facing Solari, then began.<br>
<br>
&quot;As you can see, our land covers quite a bit of territory. These mountains are not small by any means.&quot; Rhia smiled softly. &quot;There is plenty of room for two tribes to co-exist and never actually meet. However, there is one small hitch.&quot; She pointed to a small x on the map, located in a valley. &quot;This is where our tribe is, &quot; she moved her finger to the next valley over to the east, to another small x. &quot;and this is where your tribe used to be. They are terribly close together, which makes simply splitting the lands in two more difficult. But i think we can work around that. What I think will need to happen for this to be a viable plan is that we need to make some sort of agreement. For instance, you'll hunt these lands one year, and we'll hunt the land farther out, then the next year we switch. Or something similar to that.&quot; The young woman took a deep breath, surprised at herself for having said so much. &quot;What do you think?&quot; <p><center> <img src = "http://user.netomia.com/angelkim/rhia.png"><br>

Chaira had always told Dori that she had a knack for planning so she wanted to share that knowledge with her warriors.  With all the problems recently she wanted them to be ready to serve their Queens well.  She had taken a scroll from the counsel chambers that talked of great battles of the past and the way the War Queen won the battle because of an excellent strategy.  <br>
     She was unaware that anyone was in the chamber and walked in as if she owned the world.  And on some days she certain felt she did.  She stopped when she heard Rhia's voice, then another female voice.  She listened for a few minutes and then stepped just inside the main room, arms crossed over her chest.  She had been taught her entirely life that she was to fight for what was hers and her sisters.  Now someone was challenging that and an Amazon at that.  <br>
     She cleared her throat and raised a dark brow, waiting for the other two women's attention. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/urhiannonmerai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rhiannon Mer ai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#993300>(10/5/02 10:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm55.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.absolutely.net/hannigan/ah26.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Returning a Scroll</span><hr size=1> At the sound of a throat being cleared, Rhiannon looked around and saw Doriana standing in the doorway, arms crossed and a beligerent gleam to her eyes.

&quot;Dori! Hello!&quot; She turned back to Solari for only a moment. &quot;Solari, this is our Princess, Doriana. Dori, come sit with us. I could certainly use your help. Solari used to be a Queen in these Mountains, of the tribe that we found deserted. We were discussing the possiblity of resurrecting that tribe.&quot;<br>

 &quot; I think you have planned this out more than you are letting on my friend.&quot; Solari said softly with a smile. &quot; Your idea of the hunting is great, simliar to the farming methods. Which is good. Keeps things in balance. I am sure that Hippolyte will be pleased at this as well. If all goes well with our plans, I hope to have SCS set as a stock yard as well as a training place for amazons. A working tribe that can produce enough grains, livestock,vegetables and wine for the entire land and trade. But yet ready to take up arms and defend the tribes. &quot; <br>
<br>
 She glanced at the princess, then back to Rhainnon. &quot; The only problem would be to find amazons who are not afraid of a little dirty work. &quot; Solari smiled softly. &quot; How does that idea sound to you?&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uprincessdoriana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PrincessDoriana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#993300>(10/12/02 6:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm55.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> &quot;Biting Her Tongue&quot;</span><hr size=1>      Dori moved next to Rhia and took her own chair, the one on the otherside of the new Queen.

&quot;I suppose that we could send notices out to all the other tribes and ask for people willing to help you get set up, help with all the hard labor. And I&quot;m sure there will be at least a few girls who are looking to get out of town.&quot; Rhia smiled. &quot;I don't really think it will be a problem, but I for one am willing to help you in any way possible. &quot; Her smile faded slightly as she looked back to Dori. She wondered what the Princess thought of her, an outsider, and not just an outsider, but someone who wasn't even born an Amazon, now her Queen.
