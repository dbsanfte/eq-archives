Anywho, We obviously want nothing to do with you so why do you even bother? It seems pointless to come here and even try. Coming to Northern Lands was even a larger mistake for obvious reasons. You've just might, might being the key word, would have done better on Greek Amazon lands or perhaps the Black Sea Inn and Tavern forum.<br>
<br>
We must you keep on with the insults? You have a very bad temper and short fuse which could create much stress on your life. I suggest you try taking your anger out in a less offensive and damaging way. Again, this is just my theories.<br>
<br>
On another note, The Roman thing and such. This is RPG, merely make-believe. Some use it for fun, others to further themselves in the art of writing and some use it for both.<br>
<br>
Xena: Warrior Princess is a show watched because it encourages, enlightens and inspires. A show that has actually made the woman a Hero, and not just some sex object, love intrests victim.<br>

The only thing I know is I don't let people step on me.  <br>
 <br>
As matter of fact I do have alot of stress right now, my family is at the verge of a break up, and I'm the one right now responsible for what happens for me and my little sister.   <br>
 <br>
The reason why I have had such a short temper is because I have seen so much pathetic pride of people thinking that there so friggin better then everyone else, its just plain sad. <br>
 <br>
What is the use of expressing yourself, if there are no limits to yourself. That I guess would be some reason why I think these people think they can step on everyone else. <br>
 <br>
I am a fan of the Xena show as matter of fact, but the reason why I say what I do is becuase in the show the Amazons seem to be much more powerful then they are then in legend. I find nothing wrong with a women standing up for her rights, but in the process of doing that she starts pushing people down to be ontop, thats my problem.)))  <p>~*Thè göd öƒ §|èèp ãñd Ïñspîrå†õñ.*~

Alysia smiled at Artemis and then caught sight of Gaia. She bowed her head to the Goddesses and spoke softly in a whisper.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you Artemis, you are truly a dear sister to us.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then looked to Gaia and into her eyes spoke. ~Please speak with me sometime soon Mother. So much to catcyh up on.~<br>
<br>
Her eyes then looked back to her sisters.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now that the annoyance is gone, let us feast and celebrate. For now not only shall we celebrate the death of our past enemies, but the birth of our future.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled to Odessa and hugged her lightly. She then wondered where Belle could have gotten off to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugaiaofearth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaia of Earth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#993300>(7/18/02 1:14:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=239.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/thegooddochl6/images/gaia12.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Celebrate</span><hr size=1> Gaia smiled at Artemis once more before turning her eyes to Alysia-Samsara.

She grinned proudly as she lowered her arrow and bow. She looked to Gaia and Artemis, bowing to them in respect. She walked by Alysia, looking around to see where Belle went, before she stopped.<br>
<br>
&quot;Eggonaki Materas, I love that you're celebrating the Death of one hated through the Nation...and the arrival of myself and Belle...but, there's so much I want to know. Which is why I took this journey. I want to know more about the blood that courses through my veins, I want to meet all the legendary Queens. Velaska, Gabrielle...and Hippolyte. I want to know about our dear athelfi who have passed on...&quot;<br>
<br>
Odessa looked down to the the Loire Medallion around her neck. She wanted to forget everything of her past, except her Amazon blood.<br>
<br>
&quot;..I...I don't want to be known as an Alcon any longer...the man I once called Father no longer has my love, or my respect. I want to cast that name aside, and let it be forgotten.&quot;<br>
<br>
Harsh words for such a young girl, but that's what was in her heart. She knew her brother felt the same way about Alastor, and she knew her mother...well...if he ever came back, she knew Cora would probably welcome him with open arms...after a good Amazon ass-kicking.<br>
<br>
&quot;...I just want to be remember, not as Alastor's daughter...but the Daughter of a Scynthian Prigkipissa...and the Granddaughter of the Great Scynthian Vasilissa, Alysia-Samsara.&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uodessasayleralcon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Odessa Sayler Alcon</A> at: 7/21/02 4:53:37 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ucountofbailystok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Count of Bailystok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#993300>(7/22/02 3:40:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=239.topic&index=41>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ashes to strength</span><hr size=1> ***The ashes sat there in the forest for awhile, and hen started to swirl in the air, and started to take a place of a man.
