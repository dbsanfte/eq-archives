Yakut sits there, her mind still hasnt fully processed what she had just done. She looked over at Lynn.<br>

She looked back at the body and paused for a long while.<br>

&quot;Ancients . . .&quot; She whispered as she dipped her hands into the river. In her mind she could see things in other lands concerning the amazons. It was a gift that Yakut too held. She saw the death of the Goddess Hope and smiled at the sight of her blood. <br>

But inside she could feel pain. Raven never felt regret in battle, at the sight of death. Though she would never admit it, she had never actually taken a life. Then why was she suffering so greatly?
