</A><br>
</CENTER><br>
<B>Once there was a great leader in the High Council among a small tribe in Scythia, named Otrere. A small amazon, she had piercing dark brown eyes, auburn hair, a gentle voice, and an undeniable loyalty to her sisters amazons. She never was able to find a lover that suited her. She wanted a man of strength and power. Not the weak men, that seem to live outside her village.<br>
<br>
<B>She prayed to Hera to send her a man... a man whom she could be proud to father her child. She promised that if that happened, she would dedicate her daughter to the Queen of the Gods. And one night, in her bed, a dark haired mysterious warrior man entered her hut. She could not believe he was able to sneak past all the amazon guards. His touch sent shivers down her spine.. and she quickly gave herself to him. <br>
<br>
<B>Many moons later, as the tribe assembled for a ceremonial bonfire, screams where heard from the stables. Otrere was seated amongst the council, full of belly with child. Crashing was heard.. and Otrere struggled to stand with the help of an amazon sister. She looked in the direction of the crashing and screaming. As she did a large white horse came stampeding thru the crowd of amazons. It raced towards the bonfire and then reared up before the women. The horse then turned and ran right towards Otrere..then suddenly stopped before her. A cloud of dust misted the area.. as the horse pawed at the earth. Dust and night mist swirled around it's muzzle, as it snorted in heaving breathing. Otrere stood her ground. Knowing that panicking would only put her in danger. The horse slowly moved it's muzzle down to sniff at her swollen belly. The other amazons stood in awe..watching the scene. Suddenly, the horse reared over Otrere and then in a whirl of dust and smoke from the fire..it stampeded out of the village. That night, the infant was born. <br>
<br>
Otrere named her new daughter, Hippolyte. The name meant "of the stampeding horse". She felt it was a sign from the Gods. One night, while putting the almost year old infant to bed, she heard the cries of peacocks and a black mist surrounded the child. Suddenly, in the mist, appeared Hera, Queen of the Gods. She told Otrere that she had come for the child. Otrere pleaded for Hera to let her keep the child. But, Hera refused. Otrere had made a promise to the Goddess. And Hera had given her son, Ares to Otrere as the father. She told Otrere, she would have many strong daughters in return. But, this one was to be Hera's. And as quick as she had come, Hera and the infant disappeared in a black mist. <br>
<br>
Hippolyte loved her grandmother, Hera, with all her heart. All she had known was the love, protection, and guidance she had received from the Queen of the Gods. Hera was like a mother to the young amazon girl. Rarely allowing Hippolyte to leave her sight. Her father, Ares, even found some time to teach the girl how to fight and the strategies of war. He gave her a mortal horse, who she quickly named Alycone. And became a skilled horsewoman. Riding with no fear. Now, Hera and Ares both had plans for her. And Hippolyte had not idea exactly what she was being molded into. At the age of 8, after some prodding, Hippolyte was told of her mother<br>
<br>
When she asked where her mother was, Artemis could only give Hippolyte the sad news. Otrere and the amazons in her tribe where all dead, killed by a band of warlords. Hippolyte took this news hard. She began to train in her fighting skills much harder. Hera watched as the young girl became a fierce warrior even at her young age. On Hippolyte's 11th birthday, Hera told her of her destiny. She was to be the queen of a tribe of amazons near the Thermodon River. This made Hippolyte train even harder. Pestering her father, Ares, to teach her more and more.. more about fighting, more about war. She was determined.. she was going to make this tribe the strongest and fiercest in the land. They would never suffer the fate her mother's tribe had met. Never. <br>
<br>
When Hippolyte turned 12, a small group of Gods assembled. Hera, Artemis, and Ares. She was given gifts by them all. Ares, a golden belt made by Hephaestus, a scimitar from Artemis, and from Hera two small daggers made from the claws of harpies. Hera kissed the young amazon upon the forehead and then gently touched her right upper arm. Hippolyte's arm glowed for a bit, then a tattoo of a peacock feather appeared. Hippolyte looked to Hera and smiled. She promised her life to Hera and the Amazons. She would make them proud. And with that, Hippolyte got on her mare and rode down Mt. Olympus to her destiny. <br>
<br>
After several days, and the guidance of Hera's voice, the young amazon arrived in the village of Themiscrya. The amazons of the village were very surprised as the cocky young child strode up to the Queen of their village. Demanding to fight her for her position. The arrogant queen laughed and took the challenge. She, too, was young. But, a much older at the age of 21. She had challenged the queen before just 2 winters ago. And had won quickly. All assembled on the battle mound. <br>
<br>
The small Hippolyte looked up to the queen named Pisto. Her brown eyes hard and watchful. And the battle began. Hippolyte remembered everything her father had taught her. The battle was long and bloody. But, Hippolyte won victoriously. Her wounds only superficial. Pisto was wounded severly. The amazons watched silently as the defeated Queen's honour guard took her away to the springs of Canathus, where a temple of Hera stood.  Then a loud cheer and amazon cries were heard. Hippolyte was picked up and carried to her new throne. She was now Queen of Themiscrya. The young queen soon learned that Pisto had been a harsh queen. And word was that Hippolyte had become their savor of hope for the city of amazons</A><br>
<br>
Twenty-one years later at the age of thirty-three, Hippolyte still rules Themiscrya. The village has survived wars with the Greeks, centaurs, and many others. She made a promise many years ago. A promise undying. <br>
<br>
Hippolyte is a hardened warrior with the heart of a protective mother. Only 5'4" and 120 lbs, she is a small amazon.  An amazon of strength and wisdom, she is loyal to the amazon nations.<br>
<br>
In the village she wears a silk chamise dressed, belted with the golden belt given to her by her father. And a long burgundy cape, signifying her place as queen. In the garments of a warrior, she dresses in dark brown leather amazon armor, belted by that same golden belt. The purple chamise flowing down just above her knees, underneath strips of a leather skirt. Her hair is long and wavy ... very carelessly flowing and auburn in colour. Her eyes are a very dark brown. And eyebrows when raised seem that they could melt you if you looked the wrong way. Upon her right arm, she still bears the peacock feather tattoo. And around her neck is an amulet, the symbol of a Labrys. <br>
<br>
Hippolyte was once married to a blond bard, named Gabrielle. Gabrielle had stumbled upon the village with her best friend, Xena. Hippolyte quickly became attracted to the young bards ways. She had never seen someone so full of life and innocent. The Gods blessed Gabrielle to bear a child for the Queen. The Erinyes (Furies) almost seem to have it in for her as the child was a boy. Something Hippolyte had long fought to not have in the village. But, Gabrielle convinced her the boy would be good for the tribe and the Queen. Gabrielle named him Theseus. It was not long that Hippolyte fell in love with the infant, as well. Tho, now in is toddler years, her patience is wearing thin. <br>

But, the love that seemed set in stone crumbled.  Gabby's heart...not matter how much she denied it.. still belonged to Xena.  Taking Theseus back to live with her family in Poteideia, Gabby once again joined Xena on her travels.<br>
<br>
Losing Gabrielle broke Hippolyte's heart.  No longer trusting and becoming very unsure of the idea of marriage.  It didn't help that she had seen what Hera went thru her whole life with Zeus.  <br>
<br>
Now, Hippolyte remains commited to being a Queen of Themiscrya.  Joining her athelfi De 'Lerium and Solari...she works to make sure Themiscrya will be strong and safe.<br>

<br>
Last night I dreamed of horses<br>
Coming for my soul<br>
Taking me to places<br>
I wasn't ready yet to go<br>
<br>
Last night I dreamed of silence<br>
The silence that I keep<br>
All the things I could've said<br>
Well, they stole away my sleep <br>
 <br>
I need to remember<br>
The horses will come<br>
I need to remember<br>
How quickly they run<br>
<br>
I want no regrets<br>
When the horses come for me<br>
I cannot forget<br>
That the horses come for me   <br>
Last night I dreamed You with me<br>
You put Your finger to my lips<br>
And You told me to be brave now<br>
I felt like I'd been kissed<br>
<br>
I need to remember<br>
You're always with me<br>
I need to remember<br>
You're the reason I breathe    <br>
Last night I woke up crying<br>
But I knew I'd be alright<br>
<br>
Last night I dreamed of horses.<br>
