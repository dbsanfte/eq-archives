<br>
     Zoe and her Amazon escort walked along the path from the village where Zoe had her dress made, on their way back home. All of her new wedding items were packed onto the horse she'd been using for the last several weeks, and she hummed a bright tune, carrying her staff in one hand. Every so often she would stop and twirl the staff, this way and that, but she was eager to get home. The Amazon, Lexi, followed along behind. She was glad to finally be back at the village after a full day of shopping, which was not her favorite thing to do. It didn't even rank in the top one hundred of her favorite things to do. But Dori had 'requested' that she accompany Zoe, and Lexi could hardly refuse a request from the Princess.<br>
        Zoe was glad the warrior was at least being patient with her, and not grumbling too much. They weren't too far from the village, but they were still far enough that they couldn't yet smell the fires or hear any of the village sounds.<br>
        Lexi was comfortable with long silences, but she sensed that Zoe was not, as the healer's apprentice continually found some reason to talk to her horse, or hum, or plan her day out loud. &quot;Are you nervous?&quot;<br>
        Zoe looked over at her, her mind wandering. &quot;Nervous? 'course not.&quot; She smiled, but her smile faded a little. &quot;Dori though - she's been a little jittery lately.&quot;<br>
        Lexi laughed. &quot;She doesn't strike me as the settling down type.&quot; She stopped, not having meant to say that out loud.<br>
        Zoe wasn't upset; she nearly agreed with Lexi. &quot;No, but I still think she's ready for our joining.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Of course she's ready. She's been ready for you for a long time,&quot; the warrior said matter of factly.<br>
        Zoe stopped in her tracks, the horse taking the opportunity to get a snack. &quot;You're her friend. And I'm glad for that. But I hope you don't think that somehow I'm taking her attention away from the village, or her warriors, or her training, or anything else. She means a lot to me, and everything she does means a lot to me. And that includes the time she spends with all you warrior-types,&quot; Zoe finished teasingly.<br>
        Lexi looked down to the ground for a moment, ashamed. &quot;I'm sorry, you're right. I guess I just...&quot; she shrugged. &quot;She's just so damn bigger than life.&quot; The red headed warrior peeked back up. &quot;Know what I mean?&quot;<br>
        Zoe looked up at her with a smile. &quot;I know exactly what you mean, Lex. And I hope you'll stand near us when we are married.&quot;<br>
        Lexi nodded. &quot;Absoutely. I've always stood beside the Princess and I always will.&quot; She smiled. &quot;As I will stand beside your children,&quot; she finished with a wink. Her mood was improving by leaps and bounds now that they were nearly home.<br>
        Dori, meanwhile, was out in the horse fields, helping to break in a few new colts. She had been thrown for the fourth time and winced a bit, but pushed up off the ground and stood. She looked to the other horse trainers. &quot;I'm going to break this horse if it's the last thing I do,&quot; she grumbled.<br>
        Lexi slid off her horse as they approached the village and walked over to Zoe. &quot;Go on, find the Princess. I'll take care of your things.&quot;<br>
        &quot;You sure?&quot; Zoe grinned, twirling her staff a bit. &quot;I mean, if you insist...&quot; She was already backing away and towards the house.<br>
        Lexi laughed. &quot;I insist.&quot;<br>
        And with that, Zoe broke into a run and headed straight for the house - but once inside, she found it empty. &quot;Huh ... wonder where she went.&quot;<br>
        Dori hauled herself back onto the hourse and settled, then nodded to the handler to let go. The nervous horse bucked and kicked, trying to dislodge Dori and the uncomfortable saddle she'd forced him to wear.<br>
        Zoe meanwhile wandered back outside, looking this way and that. All the village's action seemed to be focused around the horse yard, and Zoe headed in that direction, knowing there'd be a damn good possibility the Princess would be there too. She left her staff leaning against the house and hurried to find the Princess.<br>
        Dori meanwhile held on as long as she could, getting a bit tired from being thrown so many times. But the horse bucked at just the wrong moment and threw her off again, landing on her backside yet again. Zoe grinned a bit as she spotted Dori on the horse ... and then on the ground. She was more than a little concerned, but this was part of the Princess' job, so the healer held herself back a moment. Dori hit the ground with her fists, angry and frustrated. &quot;Take him back to the corral, I'll work with him again tomorrow.&quot; She pushed off the ground, slowly this time, a little more stiff and in pain than the last time.<br>
        Zoe finally rushed out to her, but the Princess waved her help off until she realized who was offering it. They embraced, and Zoe led the Princess home for a good bath, a meal and a massage to get rid of the pain and cares of her day.  <p><center> <img src = "http://user.netomia.com/angelkim/rhia.png"><br>
