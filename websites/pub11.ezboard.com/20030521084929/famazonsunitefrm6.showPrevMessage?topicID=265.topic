<br>
Spotting a brief flash of yellow a few yards away, Salah Mei grins and jogs over to the plant.  She removes a hand trowel and piece of rough fabric from a pouch, then proceeds to dig up the plant and prepare it to be taken back to the village.  <br>
<br>
&quot;How lucky... I was getting low on this,&quot; she mutters cheerfully to herself.  So intent was she on this task, she didn't pick up on the fact she was hardly the only Amazon out in the woods that day... <br>

<br>
&quot;Did you ask the plant if it would give its magick to you? How come you haven't left the earth a gift in return?&quot;<br>
<br>
In tradition when a plant was needed you asked its spirit if it would give upo its life to your service and then leave behind something in return, like a piece of cloth or copper. Yakut kept a pocket full of rough gem stones to leave as a gift in return to the earth for her great gift.<br>

<br>
Salah Mei kneels back down, closing her eyes briefly as her lips begin to move in silence, and produces a nugget of amber which she places on the ground where the plant had been.  She opens her eyes again, and stands.  <br>

<br>
&quot;Me? Your mentor spoke of me? Is there something I'm doing that I'm not aware of?&quot;, The Shamaness chuckled softly. Not to long ago, Yakut met a young woman named Semporia who had also looked up on Yakut in a great respect. Yakut never thought she deserved such, she merely did what came natural to her. <br>
<br>

Salah Mei pauses a moment to appreciate a bird mildly scolding them from a tree.  &quot;We mean you no harm, little sister, and will be on our way.&quot;  Unlike most shamanesses, Salah Mei dresses in the caste's traditional garb only when performing rituals.  As a child she became too used to the freedom of movement the more typical Amazon skirt and bra top provides to change.  <br>
<br>
They start walking again.  &quot;She had no great gift for talking to the spirits, and never pretended otherwise, but she searched out knowledge like it was water.  That always amazed me.&quot;    <br>

<br>
The Shamaness walked over to the farr wall and pulled up two chairs and set them down. She sat down and gestured an offered seat to Salah Mei.<br>

The young shamaness finds herself quite comfortable with the senior one.  Yakut's just very easy to talk to.<br>

With knowing herself, and understanding herself she could fully understand others. She read people easily.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have taken a life to save my daughter, though it was essential to keeping her alive, It still kept me down for a month. It was my first kill, actually. Gabrielle was right...the first one changes everything.&quot;<br>
<br>
As a shamaness of peace, taking a life was a sin. She had betrayed her own path, but with repenting and cleansing rituals Yakut returned to her balanced way.<br>
<br>
&quot;Raisa?, you say? I don't recall her, but of course I can't keep up with all Amazons though I try to make sure a piece of the ones I do meet leave something imprinted on me. Like a memories or a feeling..I try to honour all sisters in that way..&quot;<br>
<br>
She bore such wisdom, even beyond her 35 years. Even now, she thought of her shift from a senoir Amazon to a Tribal elder..she would be proud that day and it was on its way faster than she thought. Only a few more years... <p>§-:¦:-§ Yakut §-:¦:-§<br>

Coming upon her dwelling, Salah Mei prays before starting to add the plant she just collected to the medicinal and ritual herbs growing thickly around it.  This is obviously an avocation the young shamaness devotes a significant amount of time to, and the garden seems to be thriving under her care.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, that task is complete...&quot;  She smiles at her new 'baby', then turns to Yakut.  &quot;I had another such plant growing here, but it became diseased.

<br>
&quot;It was nice meeting you, Salah Mei. But I have to ride back to my lands. Ardyn-Tyger, the gaurd at the gates is a friend of mine, and a fellow Shamaness. If you ever feel the need to do a Nature spot exercise, Ardyn-Tyger is all for it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yakut turns around, and a black stallion trots up to her. She pets his mane, &quot;Hannibal, time to go home.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Shamaness mounts Hannibal, and moves her green occulars to Salah Mei.<br>
<br>
&quot;Herete, athelfi.&quot;<br>
<br>
She turned her stallion around and forced him into a rather fast trott towards the gates of Scynthia. <p>§-:¦:-§ Yakut §-:¦:-§<br>
~Leader of the Northern Amazons of Tanais River Valley~<br>
-Shamaness of the Old Ways-<br>
&quot;Just as daughter becomes mother, the student becomes the teacher. Their strength will be their unity. Their courage will be their guide.&quot;-Yakut</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a
