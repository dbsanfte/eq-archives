She stopped by the kitchens to drop off the seven or so rabbits she caught on her little hunt, and got yelled at for her trouble.  &quot;Go on with you, you're dripping all over my kitchen.&quot;  the cook exclaimed.  Quinn chuckled and left quickly heading for Ainia's hut.  She had one more thing to drop off.  She was holding her leather pouch, that was practically bursting at it's seams, in her right hand and her bow in her left hand.  Arriving at the small but homey hut, she tapped on the door with a mud covered boot.  The door opened and she shoved her hand with the pouch in Ainia's face.  &quot;I hope you like blackberries.&quot;  Quinn stated.  Knowing she looked like a drowned, freezing cold rat, she tried to put on a charming grin. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub74.ezboard.com/uwarriorainia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WarriorAinia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#993300>(2/20/01 10:08:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=161.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re: A Warrior is Tamed</span><hr size=1> I do.

 <br>
I've got an extra fur you can wrap up in while your stuff dries out a bit.  I'll turn around if you want, but I am not letting you get sick.  <br>

Once she had everything off and the warm dry furs tucked around her body, Ainia instructed her to hang her things fairly close to the fire.  As instructed she made her way over to the chair by the fire and sat down, hoping she would stop shivering soon. <br>
<br>
Quinn&gt; ::sitting by the fire, still shivering a bit::<br>
Ainia&gt; ::eying her:: Still cold?<br>
Quinn&gt; ::looks up and shakes her head::No, I'm okay.<br>
Ainia&gt; I saw you shivering a little... ::taking a seat next to her::<br>
Quinn&gt; ::glances at her and grins::Uh...just a delayed shiver.<br>
Ainia&gt; Ah.  ::not entirely buying it, but doesn't press further - just pokes at the fire a bit with a metal poker, having to get a bit close to it to do so, but seems unconcerned::<br>
Quinn&gt; ::sucks in a deep breath::It smells really nice in here..<br>
Ainia&gt; Thanks... ::adding another log, hand practically in the fire:: That's better... it needed a little more fuel.<br>
Quinn&gt; ::smiles and holds her hands in front of the fire::It feels good...::nods to the berries::So do you like them?<br>
Ainia&gt; I do... ::scooting the pouch over:: But, I could be persuaded to share.  :bit of a grin::<br>
Quinn&gt; ::chuckles::And what would I need to do to persuade you?<br>
Ainia&gt; ::loves pulling just a bit of mush out every now and again:: Just be you.<br>
Quinn&gt; ::blushes a bit::Well, I think if I were to just be me, I'd probably lean over and kiss you right about now.<br>
Ainia&gt; Hmm, sounds like a plan to me.  ::leaning in a bit::<br>
Quinn&gt; ::lets go of the furs she's holding around her body and leans over, cupping Ainia's cheek, smiles then licks her lips to wet them, kisses her very tenitivly at first::<br>
Ainia&gt; ::deepens it almost immediately, not precisely sure why but definitely needs the contact::<br>
Quinn&gt; ::hands slides around to the back of her neck, pulling her closer::<br>
Ainia&gt; ::the fire seeming to grow bigger, within a few seconds, as Ainia gives herself up to the sensation::<br>
Quinn&gt; ::when breathing become essential, pulls back but leans her forehead against Ainia's::Whoa...is it always going to be like that?<br>
Ainia&gt; I hope so... ::snuggling in a little::<br>
Quinn&gt; ::totally forgotten that she is naked under the furs, pulls her into a hug::Me too.<br>
Ainia&gt; ::definitely aware of it:: Heh... ::just relaxing a bit:: This is nice, isn't it?<br>
Quinn&gt; ::nods::Yes, very nice.  Much better then being outside in the freezing cold and much better company then I usually keep.<br>
Ainia&gt; Mm... ::glancing at the fire with a brief mental 'oops!'::  I don't like the weather, but it does make you appreciate being cozy in front of a fire.  ::glance at Quinn:: Especially with someone special.<br>
Quinn&gt; ::quirky smile, runs her fingertips over Ainia's cheeks::Mmm, yes it does.  <br>
Ainia&gt; The curse won't last too much longer... but I think I'm going to kind of miss it.  It has given us more time to just be together.<br>
Quinn&gt; ::nods and turns to look back into the fire, reflecting, then eyes widen::Whoa, how much wood did you put in there?<br>
Ainia&gt; Just a log or two... <br>
Quinn&gt; ::motions to it::Well, thats quite a fire for a log or two, don't you think?<br>
Ainia&gt; Quinn, I'm sure it's fine.  <br>
Quinn&gt; ::looks back at her and raises a dark brow::You don't think it's kinda odd?<br>
Ainia&gt; ::finding it a little more difficult without the focusing hand motion, slowly starts bringing the fire down::  Not really...  at least around me.<br>
Quinn&gt; ::turns to look back at the fire, then back at Ainia::Uh...::pulls back from her::Is there something I should know?<br>
Ainia&gt; ::reading that pulling away as badly as she could:: I... it's just... ::uncharacteristically tongue tied::<br>
Quinn&gt; ::is a lot concerned now, reaches out and touches her cheek::It can't be that bad.<br>
Ainia&gt; I've just always had this... ability to work with fire.  <br>
Quinn&gt; ::tries to digest that::And you don't know why?<br>
Ainia&gt; I know... or at least I think I do.  It's just not something I like to talk about.<br>
Quinn&gt; ::drops her hand and looks down::Okay...::pulls the furs around her more::I'm sure my clothes are dry now, I guess I should go.<br>
Ainia&gt; ::sighs:: Quinn, there are only three people who know, including myself.  And one of them isn't even Raven, and she raised me.<br>
Quinn&gt; ::puts on a smile::Hey it's okay...don't worry about it.  ::walks over to her clothes and starts to gather them::<br>
Ainia&gt; Then why are you going?  ::for once, sounding almost childlike::<br>
Quinn&gt; ::turns, putting on a relaxed face::Oh well, I just have things to get done you know.  ::shrugs::I've always gotta work a little harder then the next it seems.<br>
Ainia&gt; I'll see you later though?<br>
Quinn&gt; ::shrugs::Could be...never know whats going on.<br>
Ainia&gt; ::nods;:<br>
Quinn&gt; ::smiles again::Hey don't worry so much...I really shouldn't have told you about me, you know....my parents warned me against that...said Amazons just don't trust Romans.<br>
Quinn&gt; ::pulls her still damp clothes back on, and sits down to yank on her boots::<br>
Ainia&gt; The other two people who know are a priestess in my home village, and the Queen... Hippolyte caught me stopping a fire.<br>
Quinn&gt; ::pulls her last boot on::We'll I'd gather you're braver then me then...I've never told anyone...well except you and now I know why.  ::stands and stomps her feet in the mushy boots::You enjoy those berries.<br>
Ainia&gt; Quinn... what is going on here?  You think I don't trust you?<br>
Quinn&gt; ::shrugs::It's totally understandable..<br>
Ainia&gt; Gods... ::standing, running a hand through her hair:: I thought we talked about this - I don't think any less of you because of your birth.  Do you think any less of me because I wasn't born an Amazon?<br>
Quinn&gt; ::shakes her head::No of course not. <br>
Quinn&gt; ::sighs::So if it's not because I'm half Roman, it must be something else then.<br>
Ainia&gt; ::sighs:: Quinn, part of the reason talking about why I have the ability I do makes me so uncomfortable is that there really isn't much to tell.<br>
Quinn&gt; ::holds up her hands::Okay Ainia, you don't have to tell me.  ::clenches her jaw::I guess this honesty stuff in a relationship is highly overrated, no wonder I never tried it.<br>
Ainia&gt; Which part do you want to hear, huh?  Being a step ahead growing up?  Going to Athena's temple for some simple guidance and ending up being told I'm her gods-be-damned daughter, and never seeing her again after that point?<br>
Quinn&gt; ::rubs her temples::No, how about I'm the daughter of the biggest enemy the Amazon's have ever had.  ::not dismissing what Ainia said::You are not the only one that has biological parents that make you uncomfortable.<br>
Ainia&gt; ::sigh:: I guess not.  But you did know yours well enough to decide whether you wanted to be associated with them or not.<br>
Quinn&gt; ::laughs::I didn't know the bastard, all I know is he killed the only two parents I ever loved.  I didn't tell you this before, he knew I existed.<br>
Ainia&gt; Athena wanted to forget that I did... that's why I'm here, an Amazon.<br>
Quinn&gt; ::sighs::Why didn't you want to tell me?<br>
Ainia&gt; Because it's never felt... relevant I guess.  Raven adopted me when I was 3 weeks old - way too young to remember Athena or Pallas.  I had no clue myself until I was 13.  Aside from the fire thing.. I'm normal.  I'm certainly no female version of Hercules.<br>
Quinn&gt; ::takes a step closer to her, boots squishing::Did you think it'd matter to me?<br>
Ainia&gt; I thought... I thought it might.  Not that it would break us up, or anything like that... just be an issue.<br>
Quinn&gt; And you didn't think it'd be an issue if I found out later on down the line?  Ainia, I've been completely honest with you, for the first time in my life.  <br>
