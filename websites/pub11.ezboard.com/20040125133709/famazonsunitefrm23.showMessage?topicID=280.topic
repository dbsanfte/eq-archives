Dark red curls framed her face setting off deep emerald occulars.<br>
<br>
Gaia's orbs glanced around the room before turning and letting her bare fet pad to the nearest wall; where she gave a blink of her eyes to summon her a chair. Suddenly, from the ground emerges a chair wrapped in vines with burgandy velvet seat.<br>
<br>
Mother Earth sat down in the chair, and as she extended her arm out as if she grabbing for something, small bracelets of vines swayed with her movement. In her hand appeared a chalice of nectar, she took a sip before the goblet left her hand.<br>

The Earth Goddess stepped aside and offered a seat that mysterously appeared next to Gaia's. The chair was a deep blue and had sea green velvet covering the back and seat. Mother Earth strided to her throne and sat down.<br>

<br>
She adjusted her position in her chair, leaning forwards a bit, revealing where she had rested her back in her seat.  And on the dark blue velvet were tiny crestasions which were left by her touch.
