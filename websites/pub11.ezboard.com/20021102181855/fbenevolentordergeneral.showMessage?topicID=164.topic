Emanie was able to make it and transfer leadership of the guild.  Here are the new officers:<br>
<br>
Valmar - Guildleader<br>
Giradella - Scribe/Webmaster<br>
Khoal - Quests/Raids<br>
Atacand - Vaultmaster<br>
Mathusis - Recruiting<br>
Ndirya - Recruiting<br>
Emanie - Merits<br>
Elbrian - Master of Ceremonies<br>
Cenadieni<br>
Trubin<br>
<br>
Would also like to welcome Kidwan back into the guild, at least for the time being.  We'll see if he can put up with my poking.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Dadijob was also in attendance.  Thanks for coming!<br>
<br>
After the meeting, we went into Mistmoore Castle to exterminate some of the foul Dark Elves.  We were on a quest to get items for our brave Paladins Valmar and Atacand.  Over the course of the night, many of the hideous creatures were slain, and Atacand collected granite from a slain gargoyle.  He is now able to advance in his quests for the prestigious Armor of Ro.  Congratulations Atacand!  All of this glory did not come without expense as Khoal, Valmar, myself, Elbrian and Allerielle died from horrible packs of ravenous elves.  Sorry to those who died, but we could not have been successful without you.  You did not die in vain!  We shall schedule another time in which to retrieve some granite for our fearless leader, Valmar.<br>
<br>
In a few more levels, we must head back into the castle to slay the cooks and retrieve their cauldrons so that our paladins may complete the quest for the breastplate of Ro.<br>
<br>
Thanks again to all of those who came last night.  See you all soon. <p><hr>

So I, personally, would like to say a few things. After coming back from my &quot;hiatus&quot; (aka Vehement distaste for this cruel game) I saw the guild in complete disarray. There was bickering among its members almost to the point of minor civil wars. Very few of the original members were left and those who were left were having a hard time being heard anymore and were giving up hope. Now whether or not the way the guild officers was chosen was a completely right or fair way to fix things is not the point. Even in the past week I've seen the guild become closer and stronger. In fact, I haven't seen one negative comment within guild chat in awhile, outside of the stray NPC that kills so-and-so, namely me. Baka druids! So despite all that is happened I am happy to be back in the Benevolent Order and I am proud that people like Giradella and Valmar have taken the reigns that Emanie could no longer hold (due to time, not from a lack of ability of course.) So to all those still in the guild I think it's time we just forget the negative and work towards the positive. Let our faith be restored and may our bonds grow only stronger.<br>

Had I seen that you gained the experience to earn your surname, I would have certainly congratulated you.<br>
<br>
About the officer situation.  We collectively decided that the guild needed a major reworking.  We were down to only one member who was regularly online that was an officer.  That was Khoal.  He was the <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>only</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> person who could invite people into this guild that I saw online after Tienen left us.  Occaisonally, I saw Tranitris.  I saw Baldrog once.  These were rare occaisons.  If you were one of those who lost their office, I am sorry.  The reason that the positions were re-assigned is that we cannot fully function as a guild if we have no officers who play regularly.  Surely you can understand this.  If you would step forward as a member of the guild who would like to help us rebuild, you are more than welcome to take an office.  <br>
<br>
Within the past month, much has changed in Benevolent Order.  We have lost many officers, and now, it seems that we have lost another.  I am truley sorry if we in any way offended you by reassigning positions, but it was something that had to be done if we wanted to save our guild.<br>
<br>
Addressing the level concern.  I realize that nothing was planned for the lower levels.  This was probably due to the fact that we did not have <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> many</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> people that were lower than 20 at the time.  I only know of 2-3 who are presently lower than 20.  This is no excuse, I am aware of that.  Now that we have new officers, perhaps we can recruit more lower level people to join our ranks.  That is the job of Mathusis and Ndirya.  It is Khoal's job to plan events for each group of members that we have.  It is Valmar's job to make sure that these three, along with the other officers, do their jobs.  Only having 1 or 2 active officers left us in a bind.  Nobody was ever around to provide leadership.  Now, that is not the case.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions or concerns, please give me a tell in game, the next time you see that I am online.  We are not out to make any enemies or hurt any feelings.  Our goal is to build as a fully functioning group so we can help our fellow Norrathians strive for greatness. <p><hr>

I can honestly say that I would like input and constructive crisitism on my performance as an officer and if i can't do my job efficiently, than i would rather someone take this current title and improve on it.  There will be bumps, expect them.  People will continue to leave for whatever reasons, but we need to accept this reality and continue forward.  I guess what I am trying to say is that it isn't the officers that run the guild it's the members.  The officers take incoming feedback and try to best coordinate the info as it best fits to help the MAJORITY of the guild.  Everyone will not be happy with the  descisions that are made, but try to bear with us all as this is a learning curve for many of us.  I personally would like to schedule a weekly meeting with the officers to discuss issues at hand the current status of the guilds and what need to improve with and other issues and then post our meeting minutes on the website for member review.  Perhaps we can make this a secured acess member only file. We then take the info and vote on it. Moral of the story is the officers are not the see all, end all and we need input to conduct business of keeping the guild running.  No input from other BO members means we being the officers decide how the guild will progress which isn't the way to go.  Use the board to state any concerns or issues that we miss for we all are human (at least I think so =) Safe travels and continued success in your travels.<br>

I think we need to start keeping a running tally of potenetial recruitments and hold sponsored guild events targeted at those individuals.  I'm kinda thinking maybe we could come up with tasks that they need to perform in order to become a full fledged memember who can actually vote on issues.  Giving them tasks to do to gain memebership keeps them interested and a senser of accomplishment when those tasks are completed.  Guess I'm sort of drawn on how to keep people current on recruits if they don't have a guild tag.  It makes it tough to interact with those people if there is no guild tag when you do the /guild benevolent all command.  I guess we can just assume people keep reading the web page for updates.  I and Math will try an come up with a general recruitment guidline by feedback of other BO memebers that is diferent from what other guilds. I know Idella had some good ideas in an earlier post that we should consider.  I ask that all members please post any info on recruitment by OCT 16, 2000.  After that date, the terms of recruitment will be voted on by the officers.  Please take the time to look at this seriously as recruitment will mean life or death of this guild   Safe travels =)<br>

<br>
     On the points brought up by Gira and Ndirya those are truly great points and I agree with them totally. I do also agree that the officers should have meetings to discuss things and also that we are not the guild but the guild is the ppl that make it up and we should try our hardest to please those ppl and make it better for them by making decisions that would please the majority. We also need to decide how often we should have guild meetings, input on this would be greatly appreciated whether it be monthly , weekly, bi monthly or what? If we don't come up with a plan on that we may end up back where we started plus as I said in an earlier post guild meetings are ways for us to meet new members and interact with each other. It doesn't matter whether a high lvl raid is planned or not , I don't know how many times I have went to a guild meeting where all the higher lvls did something and a few ppl around my lvl showed up and we all planned a dungeon raid of our own. Don't think just because a higher lvl raid is planned that you shouldn't show up , after all if the whole guild thinks that way then only the higher lvls will show up with a few others who now have no one to grp with and nothing to do. Whereas if we all show up it will give us greater opportunity to grp together with ppl of our lvls. Don't know if that makes sense but attendance at guild meetings is something that I think is very important, goes along with more than just having that guild tag up there. Hmm well I hope I am not just rambling and some of what I am saying makes sense at least to some. I can't and won't make mandatory anything as far as rules as to how the guild acts but I will put out a simple plea for compliance to something that I feel can only help the guild in recruiting , activities planned , meeting other ppl in the guild , and just generally having fun. That is my 2cp or less and you can take that for what it is worth I am done.<br>

I hope no one else felt that that was what the last meeting was about, it was open to all as far as I am concerned and no matter what the lvl or how long a person has been in the guild they shouldn't and I don't want them to feel as if they have nothing to share. For I feel as if we are creating a grp of friends who act like family and should be able to share exp's, adventures , problems that are occuring within the guild or anything else that they see to make this the best guild ever.<br>

I've tried to make a guild where people will leave a good group every now and then to help someone else, and to always at least respond when someone says something. The reason being, who wants to be in a guild to be ignored? Doesn't make much sense huh? You will probably rarely if EVER see me not to respond to someone no matter what they say (even if if makes no sense) and I think everyone should do the same. <br>
<br>
We're grouped together to have fun TOGETHER, otherwise why be in a guild? Until recently (and it has been getting better continuously) the BenOrder was not just a tag next to someones name, we were a bunch of people with a common hobby grouped together for mutual benefit and some ass kicking <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ........I'll still kick ass no matter what, I'd just like to do it with all of you.<br>
