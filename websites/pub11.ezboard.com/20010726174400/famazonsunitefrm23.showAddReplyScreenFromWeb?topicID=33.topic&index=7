<br>
He cuts an eye to the thrown of Zeus. It is but for he Apollo left Olympus. The close minded biggoting adulterating self congradulatory self proclaimed leader of the gods had disgusted the rather liberal Apollo. Apollo loved his father but also disliked him with a passion. How could someone have  reign over all the gods while remaining ignorant and close minded? He had a right mind to take advice of many and plot to over throw him. But such things were unheard of. He crosses his arms and smiles to everyone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Zeus King of the Gods</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FFFF33>(5/2/01 10:39:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=33.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Return of a Legend</span><hr size=1> The sound of thunder rippling up to Mt.

<br>
Still smirking, Zeus watched Apollo.  He knew full well that given the opportunity the younger god would attempt to overthrow him.  He smirked because he knew that even on Apollo's best day, he'd never succeed.  It had been tried before and ended in miserable failure for those who made the attempt.<br>
<br>
&quot;So my son, what brings your radiance back to Olympus?&quot;  He finally settled comfortably on his throne.  His eyes scanning those who had gathered, grateful to see so many there. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uzeuskingofthegods.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zeus King of the Gods</A> at: 6/7/01 8:28:30 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uthegreatapollo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Great Apollo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(5/3/01 2:49:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=33.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> And things settle...</span><hr size=1> He smiles to his father nodding his head a bit.<br>
