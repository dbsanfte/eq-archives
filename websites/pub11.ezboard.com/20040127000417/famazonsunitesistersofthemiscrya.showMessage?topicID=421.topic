Kneeling before it, she closed her eyes and prayed to Artemis to see to it that Gabrielle's journey be smooth, praying that she did not suffer.<br>
Opening her eyes, she got up and headed back to her desk. Looking out the window, it began to snow hard. Real hard.<br>
She sighed and cracked her back, her guard off to find her messanger for her. As she does this, De'Lerium pulls out a few scrolls and begins to write.<br>
<br>

She coppied this message and went off to the bulletin board and hung it, wrapping her cloak tightly over her shoulders.<br>
As she hung the letter, her messanger came to her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bring these scolls to the others, they must know. Make sure your first stop is Lykastia.&quot;<br>
<br>
Being in , not a great mood to speak any longer, she headed back to her hut, closing her door. Ofcourse, her door would be open for those who needed to talk. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vasilissadelerium>Vasilissa De Lerium</A> at: 1/20/03 10:24:51 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=amazonprincessriver>AmazonPrincessRiver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#993300>(1/21/03 9:18 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Death of Gabrielle</span><hr size=1> River arrived in Themiscrya the next day, riding a dun horse with a black mane and tail.  Their coloring was similar enough they could almost be taken for twins, but for the small matter of being from different species.<br>
<br>
She'd left Lykastia for this short trip, putting a trusted warrior in charge until she returned.  Gabrielle should have been honored in her own land, River thought, but she was too new in her authority to object.  She would plan a smaller ceremony, later.  <br>
<br>
The fabled Themiscrya was a marvelous place, she had to admit, even with the snow.  Even an Amazon princess could go unnoticed here, and that was all she ever cared to be.  <br>
