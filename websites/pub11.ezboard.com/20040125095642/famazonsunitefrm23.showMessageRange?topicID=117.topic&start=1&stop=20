He sat on the ebony throne which was placed in front of the altar, on which there was a black sheep being burned in his honor by a worshipper who just left::<br>
<br>
::He took in the odor and the smoke emanating from the sheep as the it was a very pleasing smell to him.  He leaned back on his couch again, somewhat sedated from the smell.  Not many had the courage or bravery to worship him.  Very often people would only offer something to him when needing a favor in regards to someone that has passed on::<br>
<br>
::He sighed as his mind drifted for a moment, checking on things in Tartarus.  Minos, Rhadamanthys, and Aeacus continued their jobs as judges like clockwork; Cerberus was at his post; Charon continued ferrying souls across the River; Thanatos stood his post and continued to torture souls; while his twin brother Hypnos was not present...probably out and about somewhere doing his own thing, which was not a problem.  His workload was being taken care of.  Every so often at the maingate Hermes was seen leading souls to the gate of the domain.::<br>
<br>
::Seeing that all was well in Tartarus he continued to sit in silence.  And still in his head, he could hear the voices of every soul in Tartarus crying out, asking for solace and mercy.  People very often wondered why he showed little emotion or cared very little.  It was for this reason, after hearing these voices for thousands upon thousands of years he was numb and very often did not care about 'petty squabbles'.  Most other gods would have been driven insane by this.  He was not.  He learned to focus on individual voices and even read their minds, and learn all that they knew and all their secrets.  All those secrets that people took to the grave with them, he know knew.::<br>
<br>
::Hades sighed as his thoughts now drifted to that of his wife, Persephone.  She was the only person he ever truley loved and one of the few he ever showed affection for.  He was careful about whom he showed affection for, remembering Menthe.::<br>
<br>
::He looked around his temple.  Not many knew the location of this temple as it was on the outskirts of a small town.  He liked it, for it was quiet.  He really set his temples up for people and gods who may want to visit, for he allowed none to enter Tartarus, lest they deside to stay for a long long while.  This temple was not very lavish, though there were some things in here more valuable than people would know what to do with...if they looked very hard and knew what to look for.  Things that would make even Apollo jealous.  They were sort of hidden in plain sight, covered with a bit of tarnish to disguise their true value::<br>
<br>
::He stood up and walked towards a window.  In the distance he could see two children at play.  For some reason this made him smile.  Until a moment later, a frown covered his face.  For he knew one of those two children would soon be yet another one of the thousands upon thousands of voices in his head.  The children then scurried off back to their town and were out of sight.  Hades now sat on his throne again and sighed deeply:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/upersephoneqofu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PersephoneQofU</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(7/14/01 4:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=117.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> A Cheerful Appearance</span><hr size=1> ::runs into the temple laughing hapily wearing a coloroful pastel toga and  violets woven through her wavy dark hair.

That stone expression that seemed to have been plastered on his face slowly cracked into a smile.  It was not because of the flowers.  It was because of his wife.  He remembered in that instant exactly why he loved her.  It was the fact that, through all this she managed to retain some innocense and joy and find them in things as simple as daisies. Persephone tends to look at the fact that these daisies smell nice and are beautiful.  Usually Hades will just look at the flowers knowing they will inevitably die.  She reminds him that there is more to life than death.::<br>

&quot;Hypnos, you have served me well always.  I hope you understand I CAN NOT get involved in this conflict.  The only means by which I would get involved is to be a neutral party and to end it.  I will not take a side in this conflict, I will however stand in the way of whomever gets 'excessive' with this war.&quot;<br>
