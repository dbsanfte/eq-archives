Thalestris - Oreithyis made her way softly through the forest quietly.  Tonight was perfect for hunting, and her crisp blue eyes could see through any dark abyss that she was placed through.  Her bare feet knew exactly where to place themselves, out of the way of fallen branches and leaves, for they were well trained as any huntress had.  Black tendrils fell across her back, and glistened like a raven's wing under the moonlight.  Her front teeth bit down on her bottom lip as she held her bow tightly in her hand, steadying her concentration on everything around her; dead or alive.  She could feel each shift that Gaia made, each moan from her trees shifting in the winds embrace, each leaf twitching.  Thalestris felt like she was apart of the earth, as all predator does when she on the hunt.  All of a sudden a large stag stepped out into a clearing, gleaming with Sirene's light.  Thalestris eased her hand up, keeping her leathers silent, and grasped an arrow.  She brought it down to the bow, easing the string back with the swiftest motion.<br>
<br>
Crimes Queen: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ::Mischa quietly sat in her throne in her castle in the Roman Province of Zucchabar, dressed in her usual black leathers and her hair braided back, she knew a time had come::<br>
<br>
Crimes Queen: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ::Mischa rose from her cast iron throne that was encoiled with snakes, and disappeared in a glory of flames, she materialized sitting on a tree many yards back from Thalestris, her eyes zoomed in on the Amazon, she was a Goddess but she was not immortal::<br>
<br>
<br>
MagickalAmzn: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Moments before she released the arrow to fly through the air and pierce the beast before her, a gut feeling altered her balance, and her arrow missed the stag and broke into the tree behind him.  As the arrow skid behind him, his ears laid back with a quick jolt into a blanket made of shadows cast by trees.<br>
<br>
MagickalAmzn: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Damn,&quot; she lowered her arrow and grasped her stomach.  She was having a feeling, but why?  The night was beautiful, still, no breeze to alter her hearing and other senses.  What was causing the gut feeling she felt so strongly?<br>
<br>
Crimes Queen: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ::Mischa had an ultimate hatred for the Amazons now, because they had killed her father, long ago...leaving her mother to raise her. The Temple Raider quietly climbed down the tree and stealthly approached the Amazon. She had nothing truly personal against the Amazon, she was just at the right place at the wrong time.::<br>
<br>
MagickalAmzn: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thalestris heard something approach her from behind.  She quickly grasped her arrows and turned around to see who or what it was.  A silhouette of a woman was what she saw, but no relief came over her.  She still felt scared, as if this time, instead of playing the predator...she was the prey.<br>
<br>
Crimes Queen: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ::she crept upon her victim, taking in that smell of the Amazon's flesh, a smile slithered across her features, a long blade appeared in her hand. She raised the weapon high in the air, and stopped for the woman had turned around::<br>
<br>
MagickalAmzn: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She placed the arrow against the bow and drew the string back, &quot;Take another step woman, and I will pierce your heart.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crimes Queen: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ::those dark occulars gleamed, not a movement she made, she didn't have to breath, she disappeared from her place and came to be behind the woman, she stepped up and brought down her blade to slice across the Amazon's back to disable her::<br>
<br>
Crimes Queen: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ::The cut had not been deep enough to effect her spine but enough to set the woman off balance::<br>
<br>
MagickalAmzn: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She released the arrow, fear racing through her heart, as the woman sliced through her leathers and the skin on her back.  Red crimson seeped through the wound.  Then she heard her arrow racing through the sky, slicing at the leaves, as she fell to the ground.<br>
<br>
Crimes Queen: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ::Mischa's blade glistened in the moonlight, she stood over her prey with a wicked look of insanity on her features, yet she was calm and not hasty. This was to be done with pride::<br>
<br>
MagickalAmzn: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In corner of her eyes, she caught the glistening of her murderer's blade.  Why is she doing this....oh, the pain.  She couldn't find words to speak, fear had frozen her vocal cords.<br>
<br>
Crimes Queen: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ::Mischa smirked and titled her head:: There is nothing for you to do but slip into the unconciousness..like slipping into a warm bath. Give into it.<br>
<br>
Crimes Queen: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ::Her blade once again was wielded but this time it came across the Amazon's neck severing her head::<br>
<br>

The Crime Queen stood proudly before the gates of Themiscrya, in her right hand the head of Thalestris hung by the hair. In the left the body was being trailed behind her. She boastfully approached the Gaurds, covered in the Amazon's blood, and threw the severed woman at their feet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Came to return your little friend here...Too bad I killed her, she was a great hunter.&quot;, a wicked smile came over her lips. Her eyes didn't scream insanity like most would expect...They were cold now and calm. <br>
<br>
She smirked at the Gaurd, &quot;So? Where's the Queen?&quot;, she chuckled and her laugh would have sent shivers down anyone's spine. But the women before her were not just anyone, they were Warrior Women... <p>~*X§X*~Mischa Julianne Corleone~*X§X*~<br>

<br>
&quot;Ohhh, she is right behind you little one. You are a stupid fool doing this, then comming in and claiming you killed her. Foolish woman.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her fingers slid up the womans face as her thumb pressed into her right eyesocket, exploding the eyeball within it. The guard came and took the Amazons head and remains and brought it to teh priestess to be given a proper wrap and pyre.<br>
<br>
Another of the guard came, daggers drawn. Cupping her mouth, she forced open the womans mouth, another guard came, and held the jaw open, pulling the top, and bottom, until the pop was heard, breaking the jaw. The guard with the daggers then reached in with gloved hands, and gripped her tounge, pulling it out slightly, she sent the dagger into her mouth, cutting out the tounge.<br>
<br>
Mikla came with rope and they bound the woman's hands above her head, kicking her knees out, they tied her back to a nearby mare, who drug her to the middle of the village. <br>
<br>
Once there, De'Lerium took the woman by the ropes and lead her to the post in the center of the village. Tieing her tightly, she bound her feet to the pole as well.<br>
<br>
Witha  cruel smile on her lips, she looked at the woman with the missing eye , tounge, broken jaw, and spit in her face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Congratualtions, you die by fire at midnight.&quot;<br>
<br>
She motioned for the six guards to keep bye her. They did so with there spears pointed at her throat.<br>
<br>
&quot;If she moves, cut her limbs off, then get me.&quot; <p>Vasilissa apo o Adelfi Themiscrya<br>

Slender hands lifted up the weathered horn to Hippolyte's lips.  Feathers dangled down her arms, that were tied near the mouthpiece.  Silver and gold amulets hung along the feathers, marking special events and promises to the Olympians.  Then the air was filled with the call of the horn, sounding thruout the village and then echoing into the deep woods.  As the sound quieted, Hippolyte lowered the horn to her side.   And turned her brown eyes to DeLerium.<br>

 Her eye twitched as she saw the grin on the murderer's lips. Well, deL had a way to change that. Unsheathing her dagger from her thigh holster, she walked to the woman, grabbing her lips in her balck leather gloved hand, she began to slowly cut through the flesh of the mouth, carving around her lips, until there was barely enough flesh. She then cut at the girls muscles in her face.<br>
<br>
&quot;There, that will keep that awful smile from your face. Now you have not enough flesh and the muscles to form one.&quot;<br>

She took a step back, spitting on the flesh of the girl that was thrown to the ground.<br>
