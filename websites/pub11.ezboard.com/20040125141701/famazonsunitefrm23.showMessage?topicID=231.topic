Soft, echoing whispers cascade off the marble pinnicals and stone walls. Servants and worshippers alike pray and give thanks in honor of their patron god. The sun is high and Helios casts his firey gaze upon the earth. The bustle of multitudes of mortals outside creep into the halls of the sacred temple while lighted torches of little need in the present time of day cast spitting flames from their firey brands.<br>
<br>
<br>
Unbeknowest to mortals whose senses are blurred to the world of the immortals, is a violent shaking of the temple as if by tectonic plates beneath the earth. The closed doors at the south of the temple shake with an illuminous light behind them that seems push at them. The doors slam wide open and crash loudly on their adjacent walls respectively as the bright green light, at first a blinding glow, slowly fades until of its presence there is nothing more.<br>
<br>
<br>
From the open void of shadows, King Poseidon strides forth in a glory of divine light. His azure tunic has an uncanny glitter to it and his golden crown, sandles and Trident shine as if they themselves are products of the suns own creation. Each step he takes seem to be outside the time stream and occur in slow motion.  Slow, resounding steps that fall on the tiled flooring of the temple as if they were from a Titan and his ambrosial locks swing delicately from his head. His journey ended, Poseidon stands before his place of spectacular decent. Piercing blue orbs reflect the image of an ancient goddess like the image of a man starring at himself in a pool of water. He smiles and bows his head slightly in humility and his brown locks fall over his ageless face. Eyes ever on the goddess he watches her with a sort of fascination as a child would to an adult he/she admired. <br>
<br>
&quot;I wandered what immortal was wandering about in my holy sanctuary. I am honored by such a visit from you and I wonder what it is that brings you here fair goddess.&quot;<br>
<br>
The while he speaks mortals brush by unawares of the two immortals here to meet. The clamour of the temple seems to dim and slowly drown out while the immortals look upon one another in Poseidon's 'house'. <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uixlordhadesxi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>IX Lord Hades XI</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 163<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(2/18/02 6:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=231.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Making an appearance...</span><hr size=1> ::Hades sat beside the scrying pool in his throne room in his palace in Tartarus.  He had felt slight tremors affecting his realm from another, which was only concievably done by two other gods, those being his brothers Zeus and Poseidon.  Viewing his scrying pool he saw that Zeus had not created any such tremors, so onto his brother Poseidon, whom had just arrived in his own temple.  He also viewed another immortal he had not seen in a VERY long time, his grandmother Gaia.  He had heard rumors of her return to Olympus, but he did not care to partake in the hoopla.  On the contrary, he did not trust her, after all, was it not her that sent monsters to try and dethrone his brother?::<br>
<br>
::Hades stood up and stepped into a shadow.  He decided he was going to pay a visit to his brother's temple.  He could have entered very loudly and announced by tearing through the ground, however he knew that to be disrespectful, for he would not dare defile his brother's temple in such a manner.::<br>
<br>
::Hades stepped out of the shadows a few feet away from where Poseidon and Gaia stood.  He nodded slightly to his brother, as the room darkened and lights dimmed due to his presense.:: &quot;It has been a while, my brother.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He folded his arms and gazed at Gaia, looking her up and down, seeming to size her up::<br>
<br>

He squinted his eyes and got up to shut a window that remained ajar, raising his hand to his brow to protect his eyes from the strong sun. Twas February in Greece, in the thicket of winter. &quot;Old Man&quot; Winter, one of the Four Seasons and part of Apollo's Council of Time, was doing his best to keep Greece  in a state of &quot;winter wonder&quot;.<br>
<br>
Apollo's whereabouts had gone unknown to most for almost the whole of this winter season. For he had retired to Delos for a vacation, Delphi being over-run by the cult of Dionysus during the winter. He covered himself in a beige chinton and walked out onto the balcony of his Deloic villa over looking the vast ocean. Azure eyes gazed down to the waves crashing against the rocks of the island and immediately someone was brought to mind. His uncle Poseidon. Ever since the fall-out of the short-lived war with the Amazons, Apollo had been in bad spirits with this uncle. It being months after the ordeal, Apollo decided it was high time to forgive and forget.<br>
<br>
Walking to a vanity mirror Apollo checked himself after changing into something a little less revealing. He thought it appropriate to wear a white toga, white itself being the color of peace, a bit of foreshadowing his uncle might perhaps pick up on. He grabbed a basket full of small jars of perfectly aged wine to bring to his uncle as a sort of peace offering. With a sigh escaping his lips Apollo was soon being encircled in a golden light, his aura spinning around him magnificently until he vanished from the room.<br>
<br>
He again appeared in front of one of the many sun-filled windows of Poseidon's palace. He asked a servant passing by where he might find his uncle, and the servant was only too happy to reply. Walking up to the room with his usual cheery bright smile, Apollo announced himself in his usual loud and obnoxious fashion.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good Afternoon Uncle!&quot; Apollo said, a bit louder than necessary, as he barged through the doors of the room. His eyes bounced around the room, recognizing Hades instantly as their forces of light and darkness seemed to fight with each other. But there was one figure that he found to be not so familiar, a brow perked on his forehead. His eyes remained on the woman as he walked up to his Uncle and handed him the basked of wine jars.<br>
<br>
He nodded to Hades.<br>
&quot;Good Afternoon Uncle.&quot; He smiled, shaking the hair from his eyes as he turned around to lock sights with the mysteriously unidentifiable maiden.<br>
<br>
Apollo took the woman's hand in his own and smiled gleefully, he adored meeting new people.<br>
&quot;I...&quot; he placed his free hand upon his chest.<br>
&quot;...am Apollo...&quot; he figured he need not go on, if he had not heard of her, she had still certainly heard of him and his greatness. His ego was naked and exposed in everything he did...<br>
&quot;...and you are?&quot; he blinked a few times awaiting answer. <p>      *~*The Golden God*~*

His eyes scan the temple and from the peripheral part of vision catches Hades as he walks out of what seems to be a void. A slight smile is given to Hades and Poseidon nods his head with the curls falling over his eyes. He gives his attention over to Hades for the moment as he breaks eye contact with Gaia. <br>
<br>
A door opens in the south of the temple admitting a group of worshippers. The door slams shut with a resounding thump.<br>
<br>
&quot;My good brother Hades, what has kept you for so long that I've not lain my eyes upon you for what seems ages? You too have been in good terms with the passage of time.&quot; He glances over to Gaia and winks at her after which a statement is directed to the two immortals, &quot;And time could never touch any of us, nor our grandmother here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Whispers fill his ears and hearts are laid bare and open to the earth-shaker, while prayers are offered and chants are repeatedly recited by tedious followers.<br>
<br>
And now walking down the aisle in a bright glow, the god of light is instantly spotted by Poseidon who peers over Gaia's shoulder at him. It is often enough that the god has quarrels but now his greatest foe has made a show of himself under the earth-shakers own roof. <br>
<br>
The jars offered to him are taken grudgingly and vanishes from the god's hands to his halls beneath the sea. The emotions he feel are expertly hidden behind a mask of exceptance and Poseidon darts his eyes over to Hades and stealthily reveals with his gaze that the god of light is an unwanted guest. Then the sharp gaze of the Sea God falls back on Apollo, boring a hole through him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, this is lord Apollo, Gaia,&quot; an extended arm indicates the youthful god, &quot; my brothers son for whom his ego surpasses his might of arms&quot;, he says to Gaia without looking at her but with his penetrating gaze held with Apollo's. <br>
<br>
Eyes remaining the same he then speaks to his brother with mocking words for Apollo. &quot;Hades, would not the sudden intrusion of one who enters your realm for whom you hold no love for be a bold thing on his part? How would you go about dealing with such emissaries?&quot;<br>
<br>
A sneer is thrown at Apollo. Speaking as one with complete confidence in his ability to back up his words is what the Sea God does. &quot;Apologies Apollo you are not gratefully recieved here with open arms. Aye, were it not for the company whom I have attending my temple I'd have laid my hands on you and broke you into 1000 pieces. Though now you may stay as long as my guests would until they take their leave.&quot;<br>

He shook the sandy blonde locks from his eyes, and embraced her gently. Apollo, being ever so perceptive, picked up on the growing level of tension between him and his uncle. A smirk fell upon his angelic face as Poseidon tried to frighten him with a stare, a stare he has cast upon the boy many times before and has never gotten a rise out of him with. Apollo wondered why Poseidon continued to try and best him, when it was made perfectly clear on several occasions that Apollo was the greater of the two. This fact was even admitted by Poseidon a long time ago, but apparently with old age comes memory loss.<br>
<br>
Apollo's face muscles contorted as Poseidon spoke so deplorably of him. Poseidon was taking full  advantage of his &quot;home turf&quot; and using Apollo's mellow temper and manners against him, for he knew very well that the ever divine Phoebus Apollo would not lash out at Poseidon in his home. As Poseidon continued to drone on in the background, Apollo threw him a stare that within itself had placed fright in the heart of Hera herself, and turned to Gaia.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am sorry dearest Grandmother, for I would love to sit down and chat whole-heartedly and get to know you far better than I do now. But it seems that I am...::he pauses and a melancholy look falls upon his personage::...'unwelcome' in this Oh so...extravagant?, abode.&quot; he threw a all too fake smile to Poseidon.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your son here has grown increasingly bitter as the years have gone by, and forgotten all that his dearest nephew has done for him. In addition to that fact he has pushed away most of Olympus in this manner. It seems he is threatened by my increasing power and by the prophetic tellings made about my future greatness upon Olympus. I fully understand his bitterness for I would be too if I was growing old and unwanted by my own family.&quot; another smile was thrown in Poseidon's direction. If it was a war of words Poseidon wanted, he'd have one.<br>
<br>
Apollo turned to Poseidon has the basket full of wine jars appeared in his hand. His cold stare falling upon Poseidon who even though surrounded by people was utterly destined to remain alone for all of eternity.<br>
<br>
&quot;No need to make threats, O great &quot;trident bearing&quot; Poseidon. I know when I am not wanted, you needn't promise of physical aggression to have your nephew leave you in peace. Still the very prospect of you besting me is quite...one would say...quite preposterous when you think about it. Because it wasn't to long ago that might I add...two...what were they? Amazons..yes I believe my memory serves me correctly...almost finished you off. Were it not for me putting an end to that nonsensical display of brute, you would have found yourself in dismal straights. Get with it uncle, since the rest of us (by saying us he is referreing to the second generation Olympians) came to be born, you have lost power. Fallen off your high horse, and it hurts. I know, it must. But don't take it out on me, your making enemies.&quot; Apollo snickered as he finished.<br>
<br>
With that he walked to his grandmother.<br>
&quot;It was a pleasure meeting you.&quot; he embraced her and planted a kiss on her cheek.<br>
<br>
Then he walked to Hades, who to which for some strange reason, their differences out-numbering their likenesses, he admired more so than his father.<br>
&quot;Hades, its always a pleasure. Though I think you've to teach your brother a thing or two about manners. Poseidon even has the gaul to bring up up refference about you angrily throwing people from your realm. I , myself have entered at the wrong time, many times before, and though your likeness for me may not be great you have never thrown me out in such an opprobrious manner as did your brother.&quot; he smiled and bowed a bit to Hades out of respect.<br>
<br>
With all that out of the way Apollo turned and walked from the the large doors to the throne room in which they were all gathered. A large flash of light flooded the room as he exited the palace.<br>

Nothing more could be done or else in the manifestation of his anger things would come to utter choas and destrution. Pale cheeks quickly gorge with crimson and eyes repressing the instinct to lash out just stare at the object of his demented desire. The god of light vanished and still the sea gods anger did not abate. He nodded to his brother after hearing and understanding his wise words. <br>
<br>
&quot;Aye Hades, and soon Apollo shall see what he was blind to in his light of glory.&quot;<br>
<br>
He looked to Hades now and grasped the dark gods shoulder firmly. His eyes met Hades and between the gaze of the two immortals you could see the kinship they held.<br>
<br>
&quot;I still am the greatest god after Zeus and you as well even though the foolish child of our brother would deem otherwise. He does not begin to know our power for he has never witnessed such a thing before.&quot;<br>
<br>
At the arrival of Hypnos, the sea gods anger finds a new object to put it on in a physical manner. He never forgot the war with the amazons for whom Hypnos in his eyes played but a small role and was useless. He turned around to Hypnos in a slow regal manner and walked before him as if to embrace as friends. Then his face contorted in hate and his hand held fast to Hypnos' toga lifting him effortlessly off the ground. The material looked to be straining out between the strong hands that held it and Poseidon held Hypnos in a gaze that would make even an immortal shrink back like an animal in fright. His words fell of his tongue slowly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sleep god do not come here to instigate things in which if you had a part you would be utterly lost. You are very much the mischief maker for one who's position is not in that category. Stick to putting to bed all those mortals whom hold you in awe as a pesky immortal like yourself should hold me.&quot;<br>
<br>
He retracts his arm and holds Hypnos close to him now. Poseidon's hot breath full of anger and rage hit Hypnos like a gail. <br>
<br>
&quot;And you come here talking of looking for excitement in a serious situation in which Apollo and I were and still are engaged in for centuries. I should cripple you now as Hephaestus is now lame for you ignorance. Hypnos hear me well and take this to the heart. I DO NOT WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE AGAIN ESPECIALLY IN ANYTHING OVER WHICH I HOLD THE MASTERY AND RIGHTS&quot;, he says loudly.<br>
<br>
He then lets go of Hypnos and pushes him back hard with unrestrained strength in the hope that the god will fall back on some object. A direct statment is yelled over to the tumbling god. <br>
<br>
&quot;Be gone now or you shall see in me a power only Zeus, Hades and I possess.&quot;<br>

&quot;It's finally good news to my ears that Persephone has excepted her fate with full responsibility and courage. You know, I thought she would never adapt to living in such a change of enviroment but I am ever so glad for you that things do go well now.&quot;<br>
<br>
With brotherly love Poseidon leans over and places his hands onto Hades shoulder. The change in the relationship between Persephone and Hades has gotten Poseidon choked up and proud. He then leans back in his chair to answer his brothers questions.<br>
<br>
&quot;Amphitrite is always understanding as you have witnessed numerous times. To tell the truth I believe of all the gods the two of us must have the most stable marriages. Also Greece is teeming with nymphs and beautiful mortals frolicking about. You know I'm not the one to pass up any opportunity of making love with a beautiful female.&quot;<br>

A laughs escapes his parted lips as he slaps his hand down onto his thigh seeming to be amused with his own personal joke.<br>

He looked on Hades with friendly mirth as the last remnants of his laughter remained in the form of a smile. When he spoke his lips seemed to not coincide with the words that left them so that one would wonder if they actually came from the sea god. And the rumour of the others within the temple who were completely at unawares of the immortals in their midst did not in the least cause any distraction to the gods.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes it certainly is relative if in fact unheard of. Though in the truer since I would say the two of us had marriages very close to that relative term.&quot;<br>
<br>
A mortal passes by and turns Poseidon's attention away from Hades. A young female of exceptional beauty and charms few a mortal man could not resist unless his sexual preference were for the same gender as himself. Her exquisitly ornate gown flowed over her curves revealing the statuesque body of a near perfect female. <br>
<br>
Poseidon's eyes roamed over this mortal and followed her out of the huge doors of the temple and his gaze remained fixated on the exit well after she left. He then returned his eyes to Hades and answered with sarcasm.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sure you do only hold Persephone as your number 1 prize, though I can't help but wonder if that is true. I mean your are the brother of two amorous gods certainly a bit of that has rubbed off on you!!!&quot;<br>

Sitting back his mind slowly drifts to thoughts of meeting new virgin females in the green fields of Greece, and they fearing him run away as he gives chase.
