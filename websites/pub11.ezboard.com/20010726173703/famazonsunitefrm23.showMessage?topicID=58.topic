His chest heaves as he breathes quicker than normal. His body begins to glow as he seethes with hatred. Outside the seas are in a spasm along with the anger the god feels.

&quot;Well my brother.  Some may percieve your refusal to show up as a giving in.  You have never been one to go quietly into the night.  Not since we spent all that time in the belly of our father.  Should we be on EQUAL standing with Zeus.  No.  However...we should be respected as Different.  When Zeus utters the words, 'I will kill you.' people may tremble.  When I utter the words 'I will kill you'  They beg plead for mercy as they have never begged before.  When it comes to Death I NO ONE is more feared and respected than I.  Thus as it should be when you utter the words, 'I will drown you!'  Those very words uttered by the Lord of the Sea should strike anyone with terror!  Nearly everyone of importance must inevitably travel by boat.  Until such time as you have been pacified and willing to deem forgiveness, use your power.  Make sure NO sailing vessel arrives at its destination.  Instead alter its route...to the bottom of the Ocean floor.&quot;<br>

He then sits himself on the couch she had layed on and told his servants to be off. He looks over into a corner in the far side of the room where his trident gleams in the shadows. He then calls 3 female servants to him. When they all arrive Poseidon leads them to the bath hall and orders them to massage ambrosia into his body to get ready for the party. They then put on Poseidon a white toga with gold lining and one strap around his left shoulder. He tells one of them to get his trident for him. She returns and hands it over to him with great care. Poseidon looks over into the mirror hung onto the wall and smiles at himself. Poseidon walks out of the palace and goes off to his stables where his servants have just finished yoking his horses. He enters the chariot with his trident in hand and places it in a holder within the golden chariot. Poseidon takes the reigns into his hands and after a command from their master the horses are off, faster than the mortal eye can see. His palace made of pearls and coral glistens in the distance and as he breaks the surface of the sea all kinds of sea creatures come to watch their master depart. Poseidon continues his journey riding slightly over the calm and peaceful waves.:: <p>Poseidon</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Nike Goddess of Victory</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FFFF33>(6/16/01 10:44:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> end of tour</span><hr size=1> ::yawns in a bit of boredom, i better get back to the party before i miss something fun ::fades away:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showMessageRange?topicID=58.topic&start=21&stop=23>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showMessage?topicID=81.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showMessage?topicID=66.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/blueMoon/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.emailToFriend?topicID=58.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.threadControl?topicID=58.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/blueMoon/deleteThread.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=58.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=58.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm28">Amazon Sisters of Cremni<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF33>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#FFFF33> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23>The Olympian Gods</a> <font color=#FFFF33> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#FFFF33> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
