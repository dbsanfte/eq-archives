They walked deep within the barn to a backroom, where again Hippolyte opened a door yet this time..offered Alastor to step in first.<br>
Once in he saw a simple room with a table, a stack of scrolls, a peacock sculpture hanging on the wall, and quills. Two chairs sat on either side of the table.  The Queen motioned to a chair to Alastor as she herself walked over and sat in the other. &quot;Welcome to my .. private office,&quot; she laughed softly and then smirked. &quot;Now...you say that Augustus gives these gifts of his own free will, Alastor?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=alastorofancients>Alastor of Ancients</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#993300>(7/24/01 12:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=255.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Truth.</span><hr size=1> He entered the bar slowly as he takes in a deep breath, ah it smelt like his war hut.

It was common knowledge of Dawn's hatred toward the sex. Even if there were a few whom she respected and loved, but even now those numbers were dwindling in her life. The one that even Hippolyte had come to the understanding of, was dead... or atleast that was what Dawn had been told about Cyrus.<br>
 <br>
 Dawn couldn't be seen by Hippolyte or Alastor, but she was pretty sure one of the warriors in Hippolyte's private office had or would be sensing her prescene.<br>
<br>
 The Amazon had taken the opportunity, when the barn door was going shut, to slip inside into the shadows. Once Hippolyte and Alastor had slipped into the back room, Dawn had lept to the rafters of the barn and krept along. Now the Amazon was along the wall of the office, and by the way the barn was made, the wall ended before it met the ceiling. Dawn couldn't be seen, but she could see, hear, and had an open attempt to jump inside. If it was needed.<br>
<br>
 Although Dawn had a weariy feeling about Alastor, she was pretty sure her Queen wouldn't need the assisstance, but she was there. And as uncomfortable as Hippolyte was with males, she figured that her prescene would eventually be sensed and Hippolyte would be more comfortable. Or atleast would feel protected. <p>

Her small but strong hand  reached out to take Alastor's in a warrior grasp.<br>
"Very well, then," she smiled, her arm extended. "I shall take your word as it is given in honour."<br>
She laughed softly, "Well, Alastor.  You have the honour of being the first male not to be drug into the City of Amazons. For the time being you may be our guest.  Until we know for sure the matter of this gift."<br>
"Of course," she titled her head with a slight smile. "You do know you will be watched.  Amazons don't typically trust males.  But, you won't be harmed.  As a man of honour comes to my world rarely."<br>
After shaking his hand in a warrior grasp, she pulled off a long cord from her belt.  On the end of it dangled a small silver horse pendant, "Keep this with you.  So, that all who see it may know you are currently under the Queen's protection," she winked at him. "Not that I think you need it." <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

He nods slowly with a light chuckle as he takes the pendant looking at it slowly. He smiles wrapping it around his gauntlet letting the horse hand next to his plam. He watches it as he jiggles it slightly then back to her with a nod. &quot;The say a man off his horse is half a man, and twice as killable.&quot; He accepts it with honor as he moves his arm back to his side slowly. &quot;I'll take this as a show or your honour.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 420<br> <font color=#993300>(7/25/01 9:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=255.topic&index=15>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Honour</span><hr size=1> She watched as the warrior tied the cord to his guantlet and the silver horse dangled there.

&quot;Thank you, Alastor,&quot; her eyes turned to the door and then back to his. &quot;I shall have my athelfi take the gifts to the smith and have her look at them.&quot; <br>
Hippolyte stepped over to the door and opened it slowely for Alastor to step thru. <br>
After he did, she stepped thru as well and walked along the barn's wooden floor.  A young grey filly snorted at Hipp as she walked by, and the Queen smiled to it. &quot;Later Monsoon.&quot;<br>
As they reached the doors of the barn, Hipp pushed them open for Alastor and then glanced back up into the shadows with a smirk.  She would not say anything of Dawn's cover.  She was used to at least one amazon always keeping a close eye upon her steps.  Then Hipp walked out into the sunlight. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 237<br> <font color=#993300>(7/25/01 11:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=255.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Cover..</span><hr size=1>  Dawn smiled to her Queen, before dropping down out of the rafters.

Dawn was always a good one to have at your back.  Ready and willing to fight.  Hippolyte looked to Alastor.  "Again, understand that while you are in Themiscrya you shall be heavily guarded.   Tho, you will not always know it.  You shall stay at one of the guest huts while you are here."  <br>
Hippolyte motioned to an amazon who was standing not to far. The guard quickly walked over to the Queen and saluted her, then gave Alastor an odd look.<br>
"Chilla, this is Alastor Alcon," Hipp gave orders calmly to the amazon. "I want you to take him to the guest quarters in the north of the city.  Make sure is settled in."<br>
Hipp turned back to Alastor, "Now, if you will excuse me. I do have some business to attend to." Hipp nodded to Dawn, "I believe you and I have a celebration to talk of."  <br>
The smaller Queen motioned to Dawn and then began to walk to her own large hut.   <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

His secondary belt including a large dagger, small throwing knife hidden in the leather, and a pouch which contents are best left alone. &quot;After all, it seems like a good gesture.&quot;
