Her face grim, as more lines claimed her face.  <br>
Out from behind the curtains that covered her door..she appeared.  And quickly moved to the center of the village, grabbing the reigns of her mare that had waited outside.  Hippolyte was dressed in full war leathers, her Queen's mask capped on top of her head.  Her brown eyes danced over the faces of those who had taken notice as she took the dais.<br>
<br>
&quot;Amazons!  Our athelfi in Scynthia are begin attacked.  We must quickly ride and unite with them in a strength unmatched by any.  Prepare yourselves and quickly follow me to Scynthia.&quot; Hippolyte then jumped of the dais and onto the back of her mare...pulling the reigns tightly to the side...turning the steed to the side. <br>
<br>
Hippolyte sat on her mare, awaiting those who would follow.  Her gut wanting to rush out of Themiscrya at the moment...but her wisdom...telling her to wait. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamazondelerium.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amazon DeLerium</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#993300>(8/17/01 3:24:45 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/deleriuml9/images/del2.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Amazons Unite</span><hr size=1> ~ DeL ran quickly into her hut almost bumping into the Amazon children, one there she quickly dressed and grabbed her wolf warmask, she put it on, and pulled it up so her face would be revealed.

She was donned in tan leather pants except one leg of it went all the way down and the other leg was ripped off so it was like half pants\half shorts. She also wore a matching top that was covered in nature-color beads of deep purples, greens, browns and tans. The beads were sewn tightly to the leather to keep them from causing noise. On her face she wore her amazonian mask.  <br>
<br>
Around her exposed thigh she had a dagger within it's sheath strapped to it and around her calf she had a dagger/sword within it's sheath as well. She wore what looked like heavy-sewn leather moccasins so that any steps she made in the future were silent. <br>
<br>
Strapped down the outer side of her covered thigh was what looked like little throwing darts, each was covered in a poison concoction of curare which acted as a muscle relaxant, causing eventual collapse of the muscles, crushing the heart and lungs and stopping them from working with a final result of death.  Strapped to her back was a sword given to her by a prince in India for her assistance in the elimation of a demon who fed on and raped the daughters of an indian village. And on her fingers, she wore a ten-set of rings. Each ring had a small, sharp blade that could easily cause damage to reptillian skin. She could add poison to the tips of these if she wanted too. And under the rings she wore black, rough leather gloves that gave her the advantage of a good grip.<br>
<br>
She was fully assorted and she had her powers as well, but her first resource would be her weapons at hand, not in hand.<br>
She walked with a strengthful stride to the edge of the village and suddenly shot up her hand in the air, and even through the glove she wore, a red light shot out of her palm and up into the sky.<br>
<br>
A sudden rumble in the distance caused the ground to shake for a moment before what was approaching bounded high above a large stretch of trees and landed paces away from her, giving one strong tremble to the ground.<br>
<br>
She closed her palm and looked upon one really LARGE tiger. It was white with black spots, easily visible through any forest, but this one could also camouflage. She gave the tiger a smile and it knelt down to let her on. It was the fair size of a good, strong horse and as he got on it, it purred a very rumbling purr. She treated it pretty much like a horse too, a horse that could eat meat and had fangs and claws.  She clicked her tongue and the tiger set out at a galloping-typed pace towards Delilah's willed destination to assist Alysia.<br>

Marpe quickly ran down to join her athelfi, grabbing the reigns of a black steed near her hut and hopping on top of it's back.  She jogged the horse over near the other's who were congregating and nodded to them quietly.  Her bow already on her back, daggers sheathed, eyes and heart ready for their purpose. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessage?topicID=274.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessage?topicID=263.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.emailToFriend?topicID=271.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.threadControl?topicID=271.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=271.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=271.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm32">The Mythical Odyssey<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm28">Amazon Sisters of Cremni<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitefrm30">Amazons of the Sacred Circle<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works<option value="amazonsunitefrm31">Amazon Language</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya>Sisters of Themiscrya</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
