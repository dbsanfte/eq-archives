OLYMPUS.  They appeared, giggling and chatting amongst themselves.  They are the nine muses, goddesses borne from the past union of Zeus and Mnemosyne. Looking at the sisters, you could tell each was beautiful and peculiar in their own right::<br>
<br>
::CALLIOPE, the oldest sister, exuded confidence and leadership.  She reigned over epic poetry and was quite the philosipher.  She motioned for her sisters to follow her to Zeus' throne.  She sat by it, eagerily awaiting her father's arrival.:::<br>
<br>
:::EUTERPE, holding her silver flute sat quietly next to Calliope.  She was shy but as sweet as nectar. She reinged over lyric poetry:::<br>
<br>
::CLIO was the historian.  She has an excellent memory, taking after her mother.  She could be quite annoying at times but none the less well respected at her craft. She sat next to Euterpe::<br>
<br>
::MELPOMENE, had a solemn look on her which never faded.  She reigned over tragedy.  Out of all the sisters, she was the least popular, due to her pessimistic and morbid demeanor. She stood near her sisters instead of sitting:::<br>
<br>
::TERPSICHORE, singing a tune, gracefully spun around and then sat next to Calliope.  She was obviously the goddess of dance and choral song.::<br>
<br>
::ERATO dreamily looked around the Olympus, hoping to catch a glimspe of Apollo.  She was a hopeless romantic, hence her being the goddess of love poetry.::<br>
<br>
::POLYHYMNIA, goddess of sacred poetry, stayed a good distance away from Melpomene.  Her actions could be mistaken of snobbishness, however others accepter her for her skills.::<br>
<br>
:::URANIA sat next to Clio.  Being the brainiac of the group, she perfered Clio's knowledge and shared her new findings in science.  She reigns over science, especially astronomy.:::<br>
<br>
::THALIA, skipped across the room and squated next to Tersichore.  Instantly, she started tickling her. She loved to hear the sweet sound of laughter.  She reigned over Comedy.::<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Where is everbody?&quot; ::Tersichore sang through her fit of laughter::<br>
<br>
Melpomene looked around and yawned.  &quot;Probably got into a fight or a war or something.&quot;<br>

But he loved the way how each sister had their own unique identity, yet they merged and completed each other, as if they were actually one being.<br>
<br>
And so Hermes turned himself into a monarch butterfly, and gently flew over to one of the blossoms growing near the altar of the temple.  Maybe he'll be able to find out more about his sisters without drawing attention.<br>

<br>
&quot;And what brings you pretty ladies back to Olympus so soon? Why, last time I heard you were traveling the Meditteranian.&quot; Apollo says with a smile. He looked to the butterfly who's aura he immediatly recognized to be Hermes's, but he dare not say a word.<br>
<br>
'If he choosed to go incognito, he must have a reason.' he thinks to himself with a smirk.<br>
<br>
He leads the Muses to the throne room where the sit, sparking up gossip and conversation. It was as if Apollo, was in a way the tenth Muse.
