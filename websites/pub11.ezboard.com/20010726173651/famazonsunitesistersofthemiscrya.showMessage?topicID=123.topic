::It was daybreak and so the young kid stood watching the sun arise over the distant horizon. Many days had gone by since the ill-fated incident of last autumn. The kid now stood alone in the world, unsure of the upcomming day or the next, or if there would even be a next for him. <br>
<br>
The sun pasted the crest of the distant boundary and so the lad turned away and began to walk down the forgotten trail of the lush forest around him. He had made this forest his home and his home it would stay, regardless. As he passed by various decidious trees and vast ranges of green-colored plants, he hummed a soft tune that he had had been taught when he was younger. Ah, the days seem so long ago. When he was young, life was so much simpler. No need to protect his own home, but to just live. That was all that was asked of him. <br>
<br>
As he walked down the trail he began to wonder what it would be like to visit the city. He debated for awhile, but when he reached the fork in the road, he took it and went north, towards the big city. <br>
<br>
He stepped through the front gates and was completely awestruck as he glanced from wall to wall of stone. It had been many months, possibly years, since he had been near any type of such civilization. A movement caught the boys attention as he swung his head to the right and spied a ragged, old man and a young, beautiful woman speaking in soft whispers. The kid was confused for a moment, but shook his head and continued on down the cobble road. <br>
<br>
Suddenly, a beacon of light came to him in the shape of a tavern. Reluctantly, the kid walked through the front doors and entered in, only to find the entire place filled with grown men and woman dancing, flirting, drinking, kissing, and gallavanting around like the world had no meaning. The kid stepped inside farther and plopped himself into the nearest seat he could find and stretched out.::<br>
<br>
&quot;Young lad, you should not be here&quot; ::Said a young feminine voice to his right side. He then looked over and was surprised at the woman's conservative beauty::<br>
<br>
&quot;Huh?&quot; ::He was only able to stammer so much as he just stared at her::<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmmm...you don't seem that bright, well, perhaps this won't be such a bad thing. Maybe it'll keep the activity in this tavern a little lower. So tell me little one, what's your name?&quot; ::She smiled over at him::<br>
<br>
&quot;Uhh...Lekemza...and yours?&quot; <br>
&quot;Nyata.&quot; <br>
&quot;That's a nice name.&quot;<br>
&quot;As is yours.&quot;<br>
<br>
::She then took a seat next to him and smiled softly as she examined him closer:: &quot;You're not from here, are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, actually, I'm from the Kingdom of The..I mean, I just got here&quot; ::He quickly recovered, sweating a little::<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, Lekemza, I must go do some idle work, but I'll be back. Would you like some food?&quot; ::With that Lekemza's eyes got wide and to her, it seemed as that was a word he had not heard in a long while:: &quot;I'll take that as a yes&quot; ::with that, she smiled and left the the scene::<br>
