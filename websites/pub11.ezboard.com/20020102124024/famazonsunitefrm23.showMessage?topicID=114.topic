Everything was peaceful. <br>
Iolaus started to whistle and walked on down the path. He reached the milestone he should wait at for his friend. Iolaus wanted to sit down but a glimpse of a shimmering something behind a line of bushes caught his eye. <br>
Surrounding the green he found himself facing one of Aphrodites temples just down the hill. <br>
Glancing around himself and not seeing Hercules anywhere near he decided to check on the temple, maybe meeting some nice priestesses....maybe Aphrodite herself.<br>
Grinnig he made his way down towards the beautiful building.<br>

She was successfull after a warm smile and after saying:<br>
<br>
Ooo.. Iolaus, how about taking a walk with me on the beach near by so we can catch up on old times!<br>
<br>
he found himself standing on the beach with the goddess right beside him.<br>
Somehow she seemed a bit nervous and she was even more happy than she usually was. If he'd known it better he would think she was hideing something.<br>
But the thought escaped his mind instantly as Aphrodite started to speak again, a smile still planted on her lips:<br>
<br>
So how's life..and where's your other half? <br>
<br>
Iolaus smiled at the goddess of love and replied:<br>
<br>
Well, if you mean Hercules...I was supposed to meet him at the mile stone right behind the hill behind...<br>
*he looked around sceptically*<br>
...behind your temple. Aphrodite, where are we?<br>
*he knew of course they were on a beach but there were many beaches in greece and somehow Iolaus would have to get back in time to meet his tall friend. He looked back at Aphrodite wondering why she had wanted him out of the temple so fast.*<br>

Before he can say anymore the dorr burst open and the god Hypnos is carried through it of four of his followers.<br>
