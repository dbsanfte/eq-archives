&quot;I have asked my brother Jarith Tiberon to give my hand to Eli. I ask him now to step forward and do so. Once that is done, we will then ask blessings from our family members.&quot;<br>

She may not be of the family blood... but the bond shes formed with us is just as good. You charish her, as we do.. you remember..she is your Wife..friend..lover..be honest with her and good to her..&quot; He walked over and gave Aly a hug. then turned to eli doing the same and whispers in his ear, being the protective big brother &quot;also remember..if you hurt the girl.. in any way..I know where to find you&quot;  steps back smiling and takes his seat. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Jexanna Fayla Tiberon</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(4/14/01 7:04:21 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Family Blessings. .. </span><hr size=1> Jexanna smiled and stood as Jarith sat down next to her.

<br>
&quot;Alysia, as my Queen you have showed me many things in the Amazon Nation. I only hope you can do the same for Vyiana. As a member of the Tiberon Family, I give you my personal blessings to enter this marriage peacefully and with love.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then turned to Eli and smiled. <br>
<br>
&quot;Eli, as my father I give you my blessings for this marriage. In hopes that you can have many more children that I can call my younger siblings. No other two people could love eachother as the both of you do.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled holding both of their hands in her own.<br>
<br>
&quot;Be good to eachother.&quot;<br>
<br>
She kissed her father on the cheek and then hugged Aly.

She slowly approached Aly, and Eli. Carrying her little bundle of joy on in a carrier she got from Xena which she used to carry Eve in, and smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Congratulation, Aly.&quot; She smiled. &quot;You too, Eli.&quot;<br>
<br>
She glanced back to the boy in the satchel, and bounced him a bit. &quot;Say 'Congrats.', Morphy!&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ulacacora.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LaCa Cora</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#993300>(4/14/01 8:01:06 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ^_^</span><hr size=1>   Yes, Cora was present. Her silence lately was simply from her lack of..well,health. She wasn't well. You could see it.  Something was eating away at her, slowly but surely.  Holding the bouncing Odessa, she stepped up next to Meg and Morph Jr, smiling softly at her mother and Eli.<br>
   <br>
  &quot;Eli, you've got a great women there. Take care of her, you hear?&quot;<br>
<br>
  She grinned a little bit. It was good to see she still had a sense of humour. A little blink, and she put her hand on Meg's shoulder, making it look like a simple affectionate move, when really she needed something for balance. She was acting like.. like.. Sayler. *dunDunDUN* The madness runs through!<br>

Her hair was neatly pulled back, a few curls falling from the top, and she was wearing a pastel blue dress. Melody was with her and she was as beautiful as ever. She looked to Jarith and Jexanna and quirked a brow...then looked to Cora and Meg and smiled abit. Then she looked to Aly and Eli and a small frown fell on her face. She sighed and hugged Melody to her softly, like a confused child with her teddy bear. *Why couldn't this have been Iolaus?* She thought to herself *Why did he have to go? Everything would have worked out so perfectly..* She wanted to be sad...but then her eyes fell upon Eli and her mother again. *Look at them...look how happy they look together...I can't be mad at them because of the one thing I stand for...* Aliya smiled softly and steped forward. &quot;Mother...Eli... congratulations.&quot; She bent forward slightly and kissed her mother's cheek. &quot;I'm proud of you.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessage?topicID=115.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessage?topicID=116.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=118.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.threadControl?topicID=118.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=118.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=118.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm37">The Mythical Odyssey Forum<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitefrm32">The Mythical Odyssey<option value="amazonsunitefrm35">Amazon Nation Alliance<option value="amazonsunitefrm33">Character Descriptions<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm30">Amazons of the Sacred Circle<option value="amazonsunitefrm34">Amazons of Lesvos Island<option value="amazonsunitefrm38">High Mountain Tiger Clan<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm28">Amazon Sisters of Cremni<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm31">Amazon Language<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6>Amazons of the Northern Lands</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
