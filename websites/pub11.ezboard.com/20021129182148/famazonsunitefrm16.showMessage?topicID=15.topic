<br>
She hadn't thought there would be any wars to come while she was in her state of expecting a child,and she wasnt all that prepared.All her war attire had been for when she was a small thing,but now,it was aparent she would need something a little bigger.<br>
<br>
She rummaged through an old wooden trunk at the foot of her bed,trying to find something suitable,something that would armor her body well.But it was useless,and there was no time to have anything made up.<br>
<br>
She sighed heavily,then walked out of her hut and headed to the hut which kept the tribes armory.<br>
<br>
Entering the hut,she looked around for something...anything...<br>
And then she spoted a chain mail thing."Ah,that could work,looks big enough."She grabbed it,it was heavy,and she knew it would be uncomfortable,but it would do the job.<br>
<br>
She lugged the chainmail armor with her as she went back to her hut.Entering her hut,she puts the armor on her bed,then goes back to rumaging through the old wooden trunk.She then pulls out darkened leather pants,and a long sleeved leather top that went with it.The clothing she had made for her trips to Scynthia,and she knew they would fit,even in her state,those heavy leathers never acctually fit her before,but now,they would.<br>
<br>
Slipping the heavy clothing on,she remembered why she didn't take many trips to Scynthia.She shrugged to herself,then grabbed the chainmail,she slips it over her shoulders,and it hangs down across her chest,and down past her stomach."Oh wow...."It added much weight,not to mention this bit of armor was made for someone a bit taller than herself."Ok....this isn;t going to work..."She leans over,trying to pull the heavy chainmail off,and finally doing so,she lets it fall to the ground.She then straightens up,and blinks seeing her hair all fudged up from the fight she had with the chainmail.Quickly she straightens out her hair,then walks over to the table she kept her weapons.Grabbing up her scabbord,she sets it in place across her back,then sheathes her sword.She then grabs a belt from a hook,puts her dagger scabbord on it,then wraps the belt around her waist,"Oh Goddesses!"The belt is too small,and unable to strap it,she walks to her door and opens it.<br>
<br>
"Kelli!"She yells for the young amazon,who soon is standing at her door.<br>
<br>
<Kelli>"Yes,Queen Kala?"<br>
Kala hands Kelli the belt."Find me a belt a bit bigger than this one.Thanks your a doll."She then goes back in her hut,and closes the door,while Kelli looks at the door,and blinks,then shruggs it off,and runs off to get a belt.<br>
<br>
While waiting for the new belt,Kala sits down on her bed,grabbing her boots and pulling them on,one by one,then slipping two of her daggers into each of them,as she finishes,she hears a knock on the door."Come in."<br>
And theres the young amazon,she walks into the hut,a bit out of breath and holding up a larger belt."Got the belt,Queen Kala."Kelli smiles as she hands the belt to Kala.<br>
"Thanks."Kala smiles."You can go now."<br>
The young amazon nods,then hurries out of the hut.<br>
<br>
After getting the belt on,and all weapons in place.Kala leaves her hut,and goes to the stables.She looks over some of the war steeds,and after some thoughtful moments,finally picks out a black and white spotted steed.It wasnt the best to look at,but Kala new the animal was well trained and a good steed.With the help of one of her athelfi,the horse was saddled and ready to go.<br>
<br>
Kala leads the steed from the stables,and to the front gate.She mounts up,double checking to make sure she had plenty of food,water and her weapons.Satisfied,she nudged the steed onward,and they were off to Scynthia in a gallop. <p>|•| Kala of Smyrna |•|</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm16.showPrevMessage?topicID=15.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm16.showNextMessage?topicID=15.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm16.emailToFriend?topicID=15.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm16.threadControl?topicID=15.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/bluesparty/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm16.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=15.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm16.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=15.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm39">Guild Applications<option value="amazonsunitefrm37">The Mythical Odyssey Forum<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitefrm32">The Mythical Odyssey<option value="amazonsunitefrm35">Amazon Nation Alliance<option value="amazonsunitefrm33">Character Descriptions<option value="amazonsunitefrm41">Land Claims and Disputes<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm34">Amazons of Lesvos Island<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitefrm40">Sisters of Chadesia<option value="amazonsunitefrm42">Sisters of Justice<option value="amazonsunitefrm43">The Coyote Sisters<option value="amazonsunitefrm44">Amazons of Pride Rock<option value="amazonsunitefrm55">Sisters of Honor<option value="amazonsunitefrm56">Shatomlic Amazons<option value="amazonsunitefrm48">*Themis-Artemis at Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm50">*Temple of Siplene at Myrine<option value="amazonsunitefrm51">*Temple of Athena at Myrine<option value="amazonsunitefrm52">*Temple of Pallas Promochos at Myrine<option value="amazonsunitefrm53">*Temple of Harmonia (Aphrodite) at Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm54">*Temple of Hera at Samos<option value="amazonsunitefrm49">*Temple of Artemis at Ephesus<option value="amazonsunitefrm57">Cymes<option value="amazonsunitefrm58">Sauromatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm59">Samos<option value="amazonsunitefrm60">Myrine<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm31">Amazon Language<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals<option value="amazonsunitefrm45">Ancient Amazon Tribes Info<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm38">High Mountain Tiger Clan<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm30">Amazons of the Sacred Circle<option value="amazonsunitefrm61">Rules of AU<option value="amazonsunitefrm63">Amazon Sisters of Cymes<option value="amazonsunitefrm64">Amazons of Aretias Island</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#3333ff>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#3333ff> -
