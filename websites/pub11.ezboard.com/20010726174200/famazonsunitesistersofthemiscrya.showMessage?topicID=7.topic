The sun barely touches the top of the trees, the morning still a dark mist.  Hipp looks to the dusty grey heap where a small fire once burned.  She gets up and packs as much as she can..allowing Sethra a little more sleep.  She waters the horses and finishes tying the packs for the ride. She grabs two pieces of bread and cheese.

  Sethra double checks to make sure they have everything..... then they load the belongings back on their horses and take off. They ride awhile and the day gets brighter and hotter. A few clouds hang in the sky with no threat of rain. The wind blows lightly towards them and keeps them cool.

They could be a rowdy bunch at times but, Justine knew that they would behave if she asked.  She chuckled to herself imagining Quinne and Fhad bowing to the Queen, especially Fhad, her beloved husband. He was not used to nobility but Justine felt he could handle situations as they arose.  She stopped to watch Dabriel playing with her toes - exploring her new world. She chuckled as Dabriel tickled herself and let out peals of laughter.  Her daughter was precious to her and a gift from the gods.  <br>

Nice to meet you.&quot; Sethra, still not comfortable on being around all those saliors,couldn't wait to go to the inn and rest her tired body.She just petted her horse while the Queen and Justine talked. She also checked to make sure they didn't leave anything behind on the boat.:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://hometown.aol.com/queenhippolyte/BC.html BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(7/27/00 4:27:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Two Amazons in a strange land</span><hr size=1> ::Hippolyte smiled seeing Justine.. and let Sethra introduce herself.

::Justine took Sethra's hand warmly, smiling at the two women. She watched Hippolyte salute her in her own fashion.  Teasingly she said.::  &quot;Is that like a secret handshake?  I never saw something like that before. It was no problem preparing for you.  I'm glad that you came.  We have a nice stable down at the end of town.&quot; ::Justine motions to one of Capt Merlobo's men to come and take the reigns from the women.::  &quot;Your steads will be taken care of.  Now, you need to get something to eat and get settled in your rooms.  Then, when you are ready, we will tour the town and meet some of the inhabitants.  Tonight you will dine in my home and meet my second in command, Captain Merlobo.  He is anxious to meet you and form the alliance with you and your people.&quot;  ::Justine led them into the Inn amid stares of the patrons sitting there.:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Danny OReilly</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(7/30/00 12:19:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> at the Clans of Skye Tavern</span><hr size=1> ::He turned on his chair to study the two ladies as they entered with Justine, then rose to walk over and greet them.
