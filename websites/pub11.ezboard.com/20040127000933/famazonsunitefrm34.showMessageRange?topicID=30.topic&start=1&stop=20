Their sounds of conversation and daily work were of comfort to her. She had somehow found her way to safety afterall.<br>
<br>
It was in the Amazon lands of Por Vida that Hope made her journey to secure mystical runes and burial markers for study. An enthusiastic plan not shared by the Scynthian Queen Alysia or Hope's very own daughter Kimbia. Alysia's loyal pets had surrounded Hope by a river. She had managed to keep them at bay, but Kimbia's arrival was unexpected. In the confrontation that followed, Hope had struck her head underwater and floated unconscious down the river.<br>
<br>
She had faint dreams of landing in another Amazon land, the Tanis River Valley region if her understanding of maps was accurate, but then she had lost consciousness once more. Something ... of a horse.. and a travel companion. Likely one of the Tanis River Amazons who took her to the nearest hospice. <br>
<br>
Hope stood from her bed, assuring a healer she would be well. She made her way from the hospice, outside to the small but well supplied town. With what money remained, she purchased a horse for the day. The owner had been generous considering the amount of gold dinars received. He gave Hope a couple days worth of small meal.<br>
<br>
Hope and her horse headed from the town at a steady, calm pace. On toward the nearest Amazon territory, the Amazon lands of Lesvos. She would reach their lands by nightfall, and with good fortune, convince the ruling elders there of her desire to learn the Amazon ways and traditions.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugoddessartemis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goddess Artemis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 355<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(6/6/02 10:21 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> No she wont</span><hr size=1> ~ Artemis appeared at the gates of the village, her hounds in line formation on either side of her.

In the distance a light mist played across the waters bordering Lesvos. The sounds of water passing over a large water raft could be heard. Someone was approaching...<br>
<br>
Earlier that night, as Hope had completed her journey toward Lesvos, she had been met near a nighttime campfire by Genesis Tiberon, who was very displeased with her reasons for being there. Hope assured her no harm would come of Lesvos. She had but two more lands to visit before her travels were complete. Given Genesis' powers, Hope assured her that if something unfortunate should happen, Gen could always catch up to Hope easily enough and seek her own justice. Genesis seemed content with that as she remained by the campfire. Hope traveled under the dark of moonlight to the water shore. A large raft was waiting for Hope and her horse. She had steadied her horse's nerves and led him onto the raft... <br>
<br>
...a large water raft did approach the shoreline of Lesvos. Any who were nearby could see the shape of a horse on the raft. The horse belonged to Hope. When the raft brushed up against the sand shore, the  horse stepped off the raft onto Lesvos. The animal was well cared for and some supplies were on the saddle. But the horse was alone. <br>
<br>
Hope had wisely chosen to separate from her horse. There was no immediate proof of her arrival, though it was very certain a horse would not appear on its own. She was here somewhere. Any who were there to meet the horse would be wise to suspect as much. Hope was somewhere on the island at this time, having landed elsewhere on her own, using the darkness of night and the sounds of nature from the forest to hide her movements, as she moved toward the central Lesvos tribal area..... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugoddessartemis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goddess Artemis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 359<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(6/8/02 2:37 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Sences</span><hr size=1> ~ Artemis tood with the small army by the only gates leading into the fortress area.

Melousa and Velaska had made sure of that. As did the other tribes before Velaska's rule here on Lesvos. She had gained word by her spys in the woods that Hope had arrived on the island, and Artemis tood ready, with her bow and arrow prepared, the same Arrows Zeus had gifted to her that would destroy any immortal who it came into contact with, and Artemis was a sure shot.

She had been caught in the other amazon lands, asking about our dead and artifacts from our dead. She has been to Themiscrya as well, but got nothing from the anceint City. Luckily, as do they, we do not bury our dead, but give them a proper amazon burial pyre. However, we ahve our sacred relics.

She was not alone. There were two others with her. Both men. One was a spy which had been sent by Queen Velaska. The other was the raft owner. The raft owner was the one to hold a blade to the spy's throat as they all uneasily advanced from the protective forest into the open before the Lesvos main gates.<br>
<br>
There was some time of silence as each of them took in their surroundings and those Amazons protectors who stood before them. Hope had desired a quiet approach and infiltration into the fortress, but with the spies moving in the forest, she had resigned herself to the truth it was but a matter of time. Still, she was not the one imposing an immediate threat. It was the raft owner who held a blade to the spies throat.<br>
<br>
Hope's eyes moved to each of the women before her. She had past dealings with Artemis and Demeter. While she did not remember any encounters with Velaska, Melousa, Eponin or Moranna, she assumed that each were capable in the skills of war. Amazons seemed to be trained from birth for such things. In another time and place, under different circumstances, Hope would have found great use for that. For now.. her purpose was more subtle and direct. She remained in silent observation of the women in the short distance.<br>
<br>
The raft owner held a nervous look in his eyes as he held the spy closely, the blade but inches from the man's throat. It was the raft owner who first spoke ... demanding answers from no one in particular, threatening to attack anyone who approached him. His peculiar behavior likely held by myth and rumors of how Amazons regarded men ... perhaps it was something more. <br>
<br>
Hope remained silent of that....<br>
<br>
He was making himself known to all as the first issue to be dealt with.<br>
His safety and safe passage, or a dead spy and any others who interfered. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenvaria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QueenVaria</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://hometown.aol.com/variaavande/images/tsianina2.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 505<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(6/9/02 1:14 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/cristalc15/images/varia3sm.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Var and her army</span><hr size=1> Varia came out of the fortress after sending a messenger to gather her troops, and she walked up next to Velaska, sword drawn. &quot;I'm ready this time,&quot; she snarled, war paint on her face, her amazon leathers on her body. <p><html> <center> <font face="vivaldi" size="+2" color="#ff0000"> ~Varia Angelina Avande~ </font> </html></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ubailywesston.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Baily Wesston</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(6/9/02 1:17 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/variaavande/images/bailysm.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Var and her army</span><hr size=1> Baily wasn't much of a fighter, she was normally calm and reserved, but she could certainly kick ass if needed, and her tribe was being threatened.

"Our sisters have died, but death is not an end to their spirits. Death … it's a pathway to an afterlife. And when it is my time to join them, I want to know that I can grasp them by the hands, I can look them all in the eyes and tell them that their blood was not shed without purpose, that we finished the job that they began. More of us may die today, but the Amazon Nation, it will live on forever. That is the duty that we carry, and the everlasting honor that we will hold."</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ukaycecyaneryderfalco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kayce Cyane Ryder Falco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(6/9/02 1:30 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/variaavande/images/kayce6.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gabrielle's Army</span><hr size=1> Kayce had been called by both Varia and Sarabi, so she was on her way.
