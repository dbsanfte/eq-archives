<br>
Yhi is goddess of light and creator goddess of the Karraur and Jiwarli.  She lay asleep in the Dreamtime before this world's creation, in a world of bone-bare, windless mountains. Suddenly, a whistle startled the goddess. She took a deep breath and opened her eyes, flooding the world with light. The earth stirred under her warm rays. Yhi drifted down to this new land, walking north, south, east, west. As she did, plants sprang up from her footprints. She walked the world's surface until she had stepped everywhere, until every inch was covered with green. Then the goddess sat to rest on the treeless plain. As she glanced around, she realized that the new plants could not move, and she desired to see something dance. Seeking that dancing life, she descended beneath the earth, where she found evil spirits who tried to sing her to death. But they were not as powerful as Yhi. Her warmth melted the darkness, and tiny forms began to move here.<br>
The forms turned into butterflies and bees and insects that swarmed around her in a dancing mass. She led them forth into the sunny world.  But there were still caves of ice, high in the mountains, in which other beings rested. Yhi spread her light into them, one at a time. She stared into the cave's black interiors until water formed. Then she saw something move-something, and another thing, and another. Fishes and lizards swam forth. Cave after cave she freed from its darkness, and birds and animals poured forth onto the face of the earth. Soon the entire world was dancing with life. Then, in her golden voice, Yhi spoke. She told her creatures she would return to her own world. She blessed them with changing seasons and with the knowledge that when they died they would join her in the sky. Then, turning herself into a ball of light, she sank below the horizon. As she disappeared, darkness fell upon on the earth's surface. The new creatures were afraid.  There was sorrow and mourning, and finally there was sleep. And, soon, there was the first dawn, for Yhi had never intended to abandon her creation. One by one the sleepy creatures woke to see light breaking in the east. A bird chorus greeted their mistress, and the lake and ocean waters that had been rising in mists, trying to reach her, sank down calmly. For eons of Dreamtime the animals lived in peace on Yhi's earth, but then a vague sadness began to fill them. They ceased to delight in what they were. She had planned never to return to earth, but she felt so sorry for her creatures that she said, &quot;Just once. Just this once.&quot; So she slid down to the earth's surface and asked the creatures what was wrong. Wombat wanted to wiggle along the ground. Kangaroo wanted to fly. Bat wanted wings. Lizard wanted legs.<br>
Seal wanted to swim. And the confused Platypus wanted something of every other animal. And so Yhi gave them what they wanted. From the beautiful regular forms of the early creation came the strange creatures that now walk the earth. Yhi then swept herself up to the sky again. She had one other task yet to complete: the creation of woman. She had already embodied thought in male form and set him wandering the earth. But nothing - not the plants, not the insects, not the birds or beasts or fish seemed like him. He was lonely. Yhi went to him one morning as he slept near a grass tree. He slept fitfully, full of strange dreams. As he emerged from his dreaming he saw the flower stalk on the grass tree shining with sunlight. He was drawn to the tree, as were all the earth's other creatures. Reverent and astonished, they watched as the power of Yhi concentrated itself on the flower stalk. The flower stalk began to move rhythmically - to breathe. Then it changed form, softened, became a woman. Slowly emerging into the light from which she was formed, the first woman gave her hand to the first man.  :::Ara smiled and looked at Alysia's belly:::<br>
As you have given your hand to your love.  Yhi blesses us all.  :::Ara smiled and picked up her cup, and began to sip her drink.  It had felt good to speak of her beloved goddess.  And hoped that Aly liked the story.:::<br>
That is my goddess.  And that is the story my mother told me over and over about her.  Ever since, I can remember and often when she would put me to sleep.  Telling me, always remember you are blessed.  And you are special for you are a woman, the last and most beautiful creation that Yhi made. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uarahutajiwarli.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arahuta Jiwarli</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.hometown.aol.com/arahutajiwarli/star-14.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10> at: 10/20/00 4:15:32 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=queenalysia>Queen Alysia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#8A2BE2>(10/21/00 12:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.facelink.com/QueenAlysia?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ara tells the story of Yhi in the Village Inn</span><hr size=1> ::She smiles:: That is a beautiful story Ara. My Atmah is very much different though. ::Begins to tell the short story:: Many many moons ago, in the nation of the tretmolec women. Their fathers and brothers were being murdered by the warrior men. These men spoke no language and had no knowledge of civilization. There were only women left in this tribe of tretmolec. ::She closed her eyes and began to think of it all:: The women cried day and night for a savior. . an atmah to release them from their troubles. There was a ruler of these women, a queen if you would but she did not have good authority over the women of this tribe. There was another warrior, the Great Samsara whom wanted to destroy the warrior men for all they had done. One day a young girl appeared out of nowhere, wearing odd clothing and such and speaking different language. She told the women that she was from the future. Her name was Cyane. She wrestled a wild horse and mounted it, being the first woman to tame a wild horse, the women called her the Atmah. Samsara challenged the Atmah in a race. The Atmah won and that made Samsara very upset. The ruler of the tribe told Cyane about the warrior men. Later the next day a man named Kor was found in their lands, Cyane fell soft for him and began to talk to him. Samsara saw the Atmah speaking to the warrior man and she called Cyane a traitor. The ruler told Samsara to back off. Kor was released. Then the warrior men came upon Samsara's army and attacked them. When the women could barely seem to gain the advantage, Cyane came riding her horse out of the mountain followed by a group of women, Cyane was screaming &quot;Amazons Rule&quot; Thus giving the name amazon to us all. They defeated the warrior men and as Samsara weas about to kill Kor, Cyane jumped in front of her saving his life. Samsara left that day and never returned to the amazons until the day of her passing. Cyane told Kor to go back to his tribe and teach them to be kind and such. He did. Many many years later, after the amazons had forgotten about Cyane and Samsara, Xena and Gabrielle approached a village. Gabrielle was an amazon queen and she wished to give her caste to Xena's daughter Eve. They found out that the amazons wanted to go to war over their Queen being killed. Yakut. ::She frowned thinking of the Queen's death:: She had been killed by a warrior man who also forgot his ancestry. The newest Queen Cyane wanted to destroy them but the spirit of Yakut came to Xena and helped her tell the amazons about their history and about the Atmah. To this day I am bringing peace to my amazons by the will of the Atmah Cyane. ::She smiled and glanced to Ara taking a spi of her cider:: I am sorry if the story was too boring. ::She chuckled:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uarahutajiwarli.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arahuta Jiwarli</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.hometown.aol.com/arahutajiwarli/star-14.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Shamaness</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#8A2BE2>(10/21/00 1:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.facelink.com/arahutajiwarli?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ara tells the story of Yhi in the Village Inn</span><hr size=1> :::Ara smiles::: no, it is a good story.
