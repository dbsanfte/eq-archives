&quot;Book Report: The Iliad by Homer<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Iliad, to this day, is indisputably one of the greatest works of all time.  This literary work had an enormous influence on all of Western Civilization in regards to style and integrity.  Many writers, even in the modern day, model their style and story after Homer’s famous epic.  It tells the story of love, betrayal, jealousy, war, duty, honor, and revenge.  The story also gives a good indication of the beliefs and attitudes of the people of Ancient Greece at this time.  Archeologists have found that this in fact may tell the story of what happened to a once great city of many years ago, though it can be safe to assume that the story was embellished for dramatic purposes.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Not much is known about the author of this epic, Homer. Though the events that took place in the story may have happened as early as the 11th or 12th century BCE, the story was not actually written down until the 8th or 9th century BCE.  From the time of the Trojan War until it was actually written down, the Iliad had only been shared verbally in song as an epic. It was actually sang orally by traveling bards who spread the story around.  It is not actually known whether Homer actually existed or not.  Some speculate that The Iliad and The Odyssey, both works attributed to the pen of Homer, may have been written by two different people.  And yet others speculate that The Iliad was a collection of authors compiled into one epic.  It is widely believed that Homer was actually a blind man, and may have been a soldier, a doctor, and some might go so far as to say a woman.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The story of the Iliad actually begins “en medias res” or “in the middle of things”, as it only deals with a few months of the 10th year of the Trojan War.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uixlordhadesxi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>IX Lord Hades XI</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 116<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(10/11/01 4:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=177.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OOC: The Iliad by Homer</span><hr size=1> Audiences in Ancient Greece would have already been familiar with the events that lead up to this story; therefore it was not necessary to explain it.  What was widely known to the Greek audience, and not necessarily to modern society, was that Paris, prince of Troy, was forced to choose the fairest of three goddesses, Hera, Aphrodite, and Athena.  Paris chose Aphrodite as the fairest, and in exchanged was promised the most beautiful woman in the world.  This was Helen, who happened to be the wife of King Menelaus, of Sparta.  While Menelaus was away on business, Helen was kidnapped, either willingly or unwillingly, by Paris and taken back to Troy.  Menelaus was furious and roused his brother Agamemnon, King of Mycenae.  Agamemnon rallied his troops, as well as many of the local kings to help him in his war against Troy.  The collective army fighting against the Trojans is known as the Achaeans.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It is in the tenth year of this war the story of the Iliad begins.  It begins, as all Greek epics, plays and poems from the Classical period do, with an invocation of the Muse.  The opening scene after the invocation describes an argument between Agamemnon the king, and Achilles, arguably the greatest warrior on the side for the Achaeans.  Two beautiful slave girls were captured, named Bryseis and Chryseis.  Chryseis became property of Agamemnon and Bryseis became property of Achilles.  Agamemnon was however forced to give up his slave and return her.  Thus, he forces Achilles to turn Bryseis over to him.  Achilles sees this as public disgrace and is furious.  He then takes his army to the beach and sets up camp, waiting to leave, for he refuses to fight in this war any longer.  It is also in the beginning of the story that the gods of Olympus make their presence known.  Here, they indicate that they will be a factor and a major influence in the outcome of this War.   <br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp From this point on, different battles are described and we are introduced to more heroes from the Achaens, particularly, wise-old Nestor, wily Odysseus, who is the main subject of Homer’s second epic, and Diomedes, who actually injures two gods on the battlefield.  The dominant figure on the side of the Trojans is Hector, who is known to be a very honorable warrior and family man.  The gods continue to meddle in this war among men, causing the war to elongate at times, with each god choosing its favorite side.  Hera, Athena, Hermes, Hephaestus, and Poseidon sided with the Achaens; while Aphrodite, Ares, Artemis, and Apollo sided with the Trojans.  Zeus stayed as neutral as possible in this conflict, though at times he himself did intercede on either side.  Zeus also did warn against the gods’ meddling in this, “Sit down and hold your tongue as I bid you, for if I once again begin to lay my hands about you, though all heaven were on your side it would profit you nothing,” (Homer 20).  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Personal honor is one major issue among the warriors of both sides of the battlefield.  Achilles walking off, due to a bruised ego and tarnished honor, is probably the biggest example of this.  Another example of this is when Diomedes and Glaukos, of the Trojans, decide to fight in single combat.  They find that both their grandfathers were friends and thus they were required to maintain the same bond.  They actually exchange armor, which was a symbol of friendship and honor.  They also swear that they will not personally attack one another on the field of battle.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Another thing that is shown to be important in this story, and most likely to Greek society, is the proper burial of the dead.  After a stalemate is met one night, Nestor suggests that a temporary truce be called so both sides could properly bury their dead.  Both sides agree to this.  Another example of this, is later on, is when Patroklos is killed.  So much effort is taken to retrieve the body so it could be properly taken care of.  It is also this event that causes Achilles to return to battle on the side of the Achaens.  Achilles feels so incredibly guilt ridden, for he feels responsible for Patroklos’ death.  Achilles has new armor forged by Hephaestus and returns, even though he knows that it would be at the cost of his own life to avenge his best friend’s death.  His sense of honor is stronger than the need to preserve his own life.  Achilles, who was practically invincible, manages to slay Hector in single combat.  Achilles then takes the body back to camp with him.  For nine days, Achilles drags the naked body of Hector behind his chariot around the burial mound of his slain friend, Patroklos.  Burial rights are proved to be important when King Priam of Troy, Hector’s father, comes personally to retrieve the body and to reason with Achilles to return it.  Achilles did give it up after being reminded of the memory of his own father and both men weep together.  A twelve-day truce is then called so Hector’s body could be buried with proper procession.  It is here that the story of The Iliad ends.<br>
However, the story of the Trojan War continues.  We find out, Paris eventually killed Achilles with a poison arrow guided by Apollo, for it was Achilles one weak spot.  This is where we get the modern term “Achilles heel.”  It eventually took the tact of Odysseus to defeat the Trojans.  It was his idea to have an enormous wooden horse built and have several men hide inside of it.  The Horse was brought into the “impenetrable” gates of the city thinking it a gift from the “defeated” Achaens.  At nightfall, Odysseus and his men got out, opened the gates of Troy, letting the entire army in, and slaughtered and looted it.  The Odyssey continues the story of Odysseus and his ten-year journey home.  <br>
The Iliad says quite a bit about Greek culture, heroic mentality, and even at times the human condition.  Honor was very important in all aspects of life.  Even honoring the dead was very important.  They felt that the spirit could not rest until the body was lain to rest properly.    It also showed a strong belief in the Fates and the gods and their influence over everything.  It showed that Fate was preordained and nothing could be done to change it.  Zeus even makes a point to allow the gods to reenter the fray of War so Achilles does not overstep his bounds for what Fate has decreed for him.  <br>
“For my own part I shall stay here seated on Mount Olympus and look on in peace, but do you other go about among Trojans and Achaeans and help either side as you may be severely disposed.  If Achilles fights the Trojans without hindrance…he will override fate itself and storm their city,” (Homer 309)<br>
<br>
It is from this story that we also get an understanding of how most of the gods are and their theology.  Above all else, honor is most important.  Analytical issues aside, The Iliad is exciting to read and an extremely fascinating story.  This book deals with various issues that still influence the human mentality even today.  <br>
