After kissing Theseus and Gabby who still sleep, she steps out of her hut and walks to the stables.  As her usual morning ritual...she goes grabs the oats, water, and bridle to prepare for her morning rounds of the forests.  Soon Monsoon is eating and drinking...as Hipp saddles her and prepares the mare.  She then leads the mare out of the stables.  Then the small Queen hops upon the mares back and silently rides out of the village.  She rides into the forest, and is glad to hear the usual singing of the morning birds.  Hipp has always relied upon the birds in the morning.  A singing forest...is a peaceful forest.  Peace.... Hipp sighs thinking bout the war in Scynthia.  Alysia had ordered her to not help, but to send warriors.  Hipp understood that she should stay in Themiscrya and keep watch.  The Centaurs had long wanted to repeat the take over they had done many winters ago.  <br>
After a few hours, she completed her rounds.  The forest perimiter and there were no signs of intruders or...Centaurs.  The turned Monsoon back home and rode into her peaceful village.::: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://hometown.aol.com/queenhippolyte/spinningsword.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Vasilissa</span><br>  Posts: 142<br> <font color=#993300>(12/1/00 4:59:12 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://facelink.com/Hippolyte?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A peaceful village far from the war</span><hr size=1> :::Hipp rides Monsoon into the village that is now stirring with the usual domestic rituals.

She hops off her mare, removes the tack, and then releases Monsoon into the pasture to enjoy the green grass.  After the Queen returns the tack to it's proper places.  She begins to roam the village.  She then comes upon the pavilion.  There she finds Terrayus teaching the young girls to skills of fighting.  The young warriors move in a Kata.  Their arms moving in fluid motion, like a small sea stirring.  Hipp stops near a post that holds up the pavilion and watches:::<br>

:::They make the queen proud.  The serious looks upon their faces.  The smooth and knowledgable moves.  Terrayus was a wonderful teacher.  And her pupils have the desire and want to be incredible warriors.  They were Themiscryan amazon warriors of the future.  And they wanted to be the best.  For this Hipp was very very thankful.:::<br>

He watches the amazon women spar and he wished he had an animal friend he could practice his skills with. He had heard rumors of Centaurs trying to take over and he wanted to help fight against them. He turns his head hoping to see Scythe, but alas sees him not. He was eager to learn to fight and sink his teeth into some centaurs and to kill them and protect Sethra, the Queen and all in the village. He lays down, puts his head on his paws and watches sadly, still next to the Queen. He wishes he could he could speak to people and have them understand him, like he can understand him. He'd like to tell the Queen he wanted to battle even though he was just a mutt. He was glad he was a dog, but just wished communication was easier. He raises his nose to the smell of fresh nut bread coming from the tavern, but doesn't make a move to get any, still remembering that night he and the wolf had caused trouble.

&quot;No, I haven't. Frankly, I don't like to be looked at by healers. It will heal itself. I'm thinking now that I might go to Sarmatia to fight. They might need help and I hate sitting idly by while sisters fight.&quot;<br>

&quot;Excuse me, my Queen, but I think I shall follow the examples of Sheyala and Jetis for now. Herete...&quot;<br>

She had a fitful night of sleep, what little finally came to her.  Dawn was not a welcomed sight.  Her mind was on the wars in Scynthia, and on the souls of the sisters who may be falling there.  The only way she could calm her mind enough to get what little sleep she did was to rise and offer prayers for the Scynthians.  'Cursed centaurs...may Hera damn them all to Tartarus.'  She watched her sisters file into the tavern for breakfast, but didn't feel much like joining them.  Her stomach was filled with too many knots as she wondered how many from this village might fall in the impending battle.  'No,' she thought to herself, 'the Queen would not be too pleased with such dark thoughts.'  She shook her head and began to busy herself by polishing her armor and tack, then sharpening the blade of her broadsword. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://hometown.aol.com/queenhippolyte/spinningsword.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Vasilissa</span><br>  Posts: 150<br> <font color=#993300>(12/12/00 7:16:35 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://facelink.com/Hippolyte?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Feast Hut</span><hr size=1> :::Hipp smiled and greeted each Amazon who came in and then told the ones who left herete.
