Hope had befriended a few Amazons with her open appearance of kindness and good nature. Always carefully practiced. Especially upon a few chosen young Amazons, new to the sisterhood ways, not so experienced as to see easily into her dark nature. Three Amazons in particular were gathered with her: Falecia, Treanna and Velaina. Each had their own stories to tell. Their own histories of loyalty and praise for the goddess Artemis and the Amazon life. Hope did her best not to become too relaxed around these women.<br>
<br>
She would need to gain the trust of a few to ultimately win the favor of the Amazon princess' Right of Caste. Technically fourth in command, after the Queen, her Right of Caste, and the Princess. Hope smiled as the other Amazons gathered firewood for another night of dance and celebration. This Smyrna tribe was in greater numbers than the past tribes she had visited. Hope would set her sights well on the fourth in leadership. Never the first. Never. That was for more inexperienced, desperate or arrogant planners. Hope was always one for more subtlety in a plan. More careful consideration. A building of loyalties to one's lessers, equals and superiors. <br>
<br>
The bonfire was lit though the remaining cast of sunset light remained brilliant in the horizon. Only three more nights and Hope would have her next burial rune. <br>
<br>
Whenever Hope entered a tribal land, there were seven days to which her plan might be found out or a challenge set to ruin her schemes. If nothing within seven days (of the first post), then she always managed to get her rune. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#9fb7df><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugabbyshope.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GabbysHOPE</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#3333ff>(4/21/02 10:37 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://images.channeladvisor.com/Sell/SSProfiles/30005913/Images/gabares.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Up To No Good</span><hr size=1> On this the seventh final night of the Smyrna tribe's festival of harvest, Hope's plans drew to completion. Another night of celebration and dance about the blazing bonfire. Another evening of tribute to the goddesses Artemis and Demeter. A fire which caught Hope's thoughts off guard as she remembered her days in the temples. A blaze very much alive in her spirit and intent upon this land. <br>
<br>
Hope had befriended the Amazon princess' Right of Caste as she had intended. Her three Amazon friends Falecia, Treanna and Velaina had introduced her. True they were new to the tribe, but to hold good words from three Amazons was enough to earn the Right of Caste's trust. Hope had planned her deception that way all along.<br>
<br>
The woman's festival wine had been drugged and she rested within her tent. Treanna and Velaina rested on the floor. The youngest Falecia was not there however. She had stepped out to rejoin the dancing. Hope had used the time to search the Right of Caste's tent to find a small marking, a small rune from her mother's mother that would serve Hope's interests all too well.<br>
<br>
Hope was fond of young Falecia. In many ways she reminded her of a young priestess of long ago by the name of Seraphim. How tragic then that Falecia had decided to return. Unfortunate that Hope had had no alternative. It was quiet and quick at least. The brief glint of light which passed over the ceremonial dagger blade. Falecia now rested with the others... more of a permanent sleep which the others would soon discover the next morning. <br>
<br>
Hope wished her spirit well. She would need that good blessing if a few more tribal runes were to be gathered. Hope only needed a majority of ancient burial runes or markings from the Amazon tribes. Nine runes from the seventeen tribes. And then... then Hope would control them all, either directly or through threat of misuse of their ancestors. Hope would control the living, the dead, and in the end she would be the greatest Amazon queen ever known.<br>
<br>
Hope smiled briefly as she passed out of the tent. The bonfire casting a reflective light against her deceptively gentle looking face. Her mother would be so proud... eventually. But that was another plan of hers altogether and Hope's plans here were now complete. Onward... to the Amazon lands of the Sacred Circle.. and the next rune...<br>
<br>
1st Rune ~ Paphos Tribe<br>
2nd Rune ~ Myrine Tribe<br>
3rd Rune ~ Nomain Tribe<br>
4th Rune ~ Smyrna Tribe <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a
