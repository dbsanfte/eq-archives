The air was humid and heavy, thick with unreleased moisture.  Looking up, the sky was completed obscured by the immense foliage which grew rampant within this jungle.  The crumbling temple in front of her had long been forgotten, yet its inhabitants were not.  Within dwelled three powerful immortals, deities that controlled a part of Hecate that she hoped would soon be rectified.<br>
<br>
This is the temple of the Fates, goddesses three, who decided how long before the eternal sleep would take place.  Although as an immortal, such an even should not, would not happen.  Yet there were things that could also occur, which would be as deadly, for an immortal.<br>
<br>
Hecate had scribed for her future not too long ago.  Usually, such visions were often clouded with uncertainty and numerous probabilites.  Yet with this recent vision, Hecate felt sure that she had glimpsed a possilbe truth.  She foresaw the downfall of the Olympians.  Sometime in the far future, they, the Greek gods, would be forgotten, tossed into the rabble of myths and childhood stories.  What they had accomplished would fade, their greatness eroded, their glory denied.  <br>
<br>
For any immortal, their power stemmed from their worshippers.  The more they had, the greater their strength.  To be forgotten, to be unworshipped, would condemn the enitity into a state of torpor, aform of dreamless sleep where they floated in a place of emptiness, impotent for all time.<br>
<br>
This had scared Hecate.  She had seen a world where magic had been forgotten, diminished to a trickle, where once it had roared and crashed, an elemental force undenied.  Was  this inevitable?  Could this course be changed?  She was working hard at doing just this, but she had to have contingencies, just in case she failed.  That was why she was here today.<br>
<br>
She knew the Fates presided over the Tapestry of Time.  That is her target.  If she could somehow get her hands upon the tapestry, then she could insure her future.  But how to do so is the question.  So she stood outside, wondering again.  If she should fail...that is a thought too scary to contemplate. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hecategoddessofmagic>Hecate Goddess of Magic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(4/21/03 9:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=313.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://nefaria.com/gallery/1152x864/art/sorceress1152.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Future</span><hr size=1> The entrance to the delapidated temple was covered with thick vines and dirt.  The air was still, lifeless, but Hecate knew better.  The presence of intense magic permeated the environ, and she could tell easily where the origin was.  Deep within lay her goal, but she didn't think it would be easy.  The Fates would know she was here, and whether she was going to be giving access or not would soon be determined.<br>
<br>
She proceeded to walk through, but was immediately rebuffed.  Some sort of invisible field obstructed the entrance.  She placed her hand against the invisible barrier  and she felt tiny sparks travel up along her arms.  It tickled a bit, but did no further harm.  This must be the Fates way of gently yet clearly indicating that they did not want her there.  But Hecate was not going to be deterred.  Her very future may lay within, and the Fate would have to do a whole lot more than this.<br>
<br>
She pushed with her hand, and her hand began to glow.  Starting from a lazy ember-red, the color slowly began to brighten, until her hand became pure white.  Crackles and sparks began to erupt along the once invisible barrier.  As her magic mingled with that of the Fates, it soon became a battle of will.  But Hecate is the mistress of magic, and she would not be denied.  In terms of magic, she reigned supreme.  So while she pushed with her hand, she began calling upon ancient words of magic.  The shield beneath her hand began to squirm, as if alive and uncomfortable.  The vibrations began to increase in intensity until the very foundation of the temple began to quake.  Suddenly the shield erupted.  Shards of disintegrating magic flew in all directions, falling upon the goddess in a golden shower of sparks.  Smiling, Hecate, proceeded onwards.<br>

The interior was pitch black, but this did not bother the goddess.  Uttering a simple word, the room was suddenly lit, the source unknown.  The floors and walls were think with moss and fungi.  Creatures suddenly slid, hopped, or ran for safety, scared by the sudden illumination.  <br>
<br>
Hecate looked around the room, as if expecting something.  Not known for her patience, she called out.<br>
<br>
::Sisters, I know you can hear me.  And I know you know why I'm here.  Don't be difficult.  Give me what I want and I will trouble you no more.  <br>
<br>
Suddenly, a unison of voices could be heard, whispy yet clear, carried upon some unseen wind.<br>
<br>
::You use our relationship too loosely &quot;sister&quot;.  How dare you come in here without our permission, and have the audacity to claim what is rightfully ours.  Remember who you are dealing with.  Leave now before it is too late.<br>
<br>
This really rubbed Hecate the wrong way.  She threw her arms into the air, while her hair blew crazily behind her.  Shouting the words of a powerful spell, a greenish halo auddenly enveloped her.  She pointed at the walls on either side of her, and blasts of verdant flames flew from her fingertips.  The defenseless walls fell with agonizing wails and groans.<br>
<br>
Then suddenly the debris of rocks sprang back, rebuilding what had been destroyed.  <br>
<br>
::Hecate, do not be as stupid as that.  We can always undo what you destroy, for we control destiny, we manipulate time.  The only reason we have not returned &quot;in favor&quot; is because we all have agreed to an immortal vow never to harm another.  Don't make us break that promise, for you will be the first to taste our wrath!<br>

<br>
Laughter permeated the chamber, echoing and bouncing off the walls.  Hecate was furious.  How dare they ridicule her!  She would have torn the temple asunder, brick from brick, but she knew it would be futile.  So she stood there in silent fury, as the sunds of laughter gradually faded away.<br>
<br>
The symphony of voices began again, although mockingly.<br>
<br>
::Young one, you have no pwer over us.  What you say may come to pass, but this does not trouble us.  For even in a world without gods and goddessess, we will prevail.

Her eyes narrowed venemously when she saw who had appeared.  Hades is one of the wild cards within the equation.  Typical, now she had to deal with him as well.<br>
<br>
::Hades, what are you doing here?  This has nothing to do with you.  Stay out!  I swear, if you ruin my chances, there is nowhere in all of Tartarus you can hide from me!<br>
<br>
She was about to rant some more when she suddenly changed her mind.  It wouldn't do any good.  It would most likely piss him off, and she couldn't afford that right now.  So maybe she could reason with him, although she has learned long ago that dealing with the male species using logic and reason often ended up in morbid failure.<br>
<br>
::Wait, I apologize.  This concerns you as much as I do.  Your future is as uncertain as mine, probably more so.  Hades, in the future, your position as ruler of the underworld will be usurped many many times.  No longer will mortals quake when your name is mentioned.  Your role in molding humanity will be relegated to mere fantasy tales and myths.  As long as there is magic left in this world, I shall survive.  But when mortals stop fearing you, and believe some other deity rules their afterlife, so goes their souls when they die.  And when that happens, your powers will ebb, and you will fade!!  The glorious Hades, a god no longer!!<br>
<br>
Hecate shouted this with all her might.  Just in case some other godling was scrying all this, she thought the more she pulled to her side, the stronger stance she had against the Fates.<br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;My dear Hecate, you just don't get it to do you?&quot;<br>
<br>
::He stood a little bit more at ease and approached her slowly, that same grin upon his face, not intimidated at all by her stance::<br>
<br>
&quot;Everything dies.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He turned around as if to walk away, but then stopped and turned around, walking towards her again::<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, I forget, dear Hecate, you need elaboration upon such cryptic statements.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He placed his hands behind his back and slowly began pacing about::<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you know how it is I had such easy access to this temple? You had to tear down the magickal barriers and storm your way in. I strolled my way in through the shadows, no fighting, no energy expended other than to walk. This temple is not incredibly well maintained. There are shrubs and weeds growing about this place. Plants die. Therefore I have access to see and visit them. If it is alive, it will inevitably come under my domain. I know WHEN it will die.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He paused for a moment and then cleared his throat::<br>
<br>
&quot;I remember a time of oblivion. Upon my birth, I was swallowed by father, Cronus. Me and four of my siblings. You see, Cronus knew that one of us would succeed him. He was afraid, he feared that day desperately. Desperatly enough that he swallowed his own children. Spending time in his belly was as if existing within oblivion. Ask any of the original Olympians, save Zeus of course about it, and they will tell you the same. It is for that act of freedom that I will be eternally grateful to Zeus, despite our other differences.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He looked about the temple and walked about with his hands behind him::<br>
<br>
&quot;Cronus of course was successor to Grandfather Uranus. Now let me ask you? Where is Grandfather Uranus now? No one has seen or heard from him since he was immasculated. Where is Father Cronus. Locked away in the bowels fo Tartarus, existing in oblivion. The same fate that he had bestowed upon me and my siblings. You see, we were born, Hecate. We were ALL created. And thus we will ALL die. Myself included.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He once again, turned his direct attention to Hecate. He gave her a very piercing gaze. The type of gaze that would literally strike terror into the heart of a mere mortal. He knew Hecate would not run in fear, this was not his intention::<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, eventually the mortals will forget me. And yes, some other being yet to be created, or one that exists in another time, another place, shall be the Lord of the Dead. Mortals will also forget magick. They will forget that it exists. And thus, you will also fade into an unconscious oblivion. ALL the Olympians will fade away.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He paused for a moment and relaxed his gaze a bit::<br>
<br>
&quot;You may not wish to accept your fate, and this is fine. You can leave this world the same way you came in, Kicking and Screaming. But inevitably, you WILL leave this world. It is the way of things. The old must die to make room for the young. And yes, eventually we will make room for others.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He sighed for a moment:: &quot;When I first became Lord of the Underworld, I foresaw the very same prediction that haunts you. I approached the Fates with practically the same questions. They responded with a very simple, cryptic, and yet profound statement, from a writer that has yet to be born.&quot;<br>
<br>
'That is not dead which can eternal lie, <br>
And with strange aeons even death may die'<br>

Was she hearing him correctly?  The ruler of the underworld would willingly give up his powers, his immortal life, so willingly and complacently?  This could not be possible.<br>
<br>
::Hades, what you are saying is foolish.  You command powers beyond comprehension, and you would willingly give it up without a fight?  You who understand better than anyone else what it means to be void of life, to be forgotten, like those souls you rule over.  And yet you would welcome such a fate for yourself?  You proclaim that you have asked this very same question, and yet you have not done anything, are not doing anything to change it?  Have you gone mad?<br>

<br>
::Are all the other Olympians the same as you?  Do they also share this same ideal? Have you all grown so fat and lazy that you would all welcome oblivion? <br>

Screaming and shouting, she pointed at Hades.<br>

&quot;I have fought to maintain my Throne. I will fight with all my being. But, how do you fight inevitability? So you remove your thread from the Great Tapestry? Then what. You think you will save yourself from inevitability? You remove your thread from that Tapestry, you will nullify your own existence, you Damn Fool.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;You cannot change the future. So make your mark in the present. I am content with ruling the Underworld. It was the straw that Fate handed me, and I shall defend that straw with every ounce of my power. But eventually, Fate will choose when I surrender it. Will it be in battle? Perhaps. Will it be as I sleep in a bed? Perhaps. Only I and the Fates know.&quot;<br>
<br>
::The anger beginning to peak::<br>
<br>
&quot;So, okay Hypothetically. We pull our threads and manage not to blink ourselves out of exisence. We now exist outside of Time &amp; Fate. We become the Rulers of the World for all Time!  Then what? We rule the mortal realm heavy handedly, and deep down the Mortals begin to resent us...they begin to hate us. Then what, slaughter then and Create new ones?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have learned the limit of my power Hecate. And I have surpassed it quite a few times. But, I know better than to push my luck. Have you ever wondered why I have never done what you are planning to do now? Have you ever wondered why the Mighty Zeus himself has not done this? Or perhaps the God of Prophesy himself, Apollo? You think they lack the courage, the 'guts' to do it? They dread the end just like the rest of us. If you think you have been the only one to foresee this, then truly your Ego has clouded your better judgement!&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hecategoddessofmagic>Hecate Goddess of Magic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(4/24/03 7:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=313.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://nefaria.com/gallery/1152x864/art/sorceress1152.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Clarification</span><hr size=1> Hecate crossed her arms across her chest.

<br>
::Hades, maybe the reason you are here confronting me is because the Fates are manipulating us.  They foresaw that I would be here, and therefore had braided our paths so that they would cross, so that they can use you to stop me.  That will not happen!!  You mention Zeus, but you know how lazy and useless he can be.  He thinks with his groin, not with his head.  He only cares for his next conquest, nothing more.  As for Apollo, he's too young, and like his father, looks towards the next virgin to slate his lust.  But you are different.  Your heart lies with Persephone, and she with you.  How could you condemn her into a fate of anonymity?  I thought you loved her beyond all else, and yet you would allow her name to become sullied and trodden upon by those spineless mortals.  You think mortals can destroy us?  That's preposterous!!  If we hold our destinies, how could the mortals overthrow us?  They are nothing!!  Any one of us can wipe out whole civilizations in a blink of an eye.  And that is why they revere and fear us, because we hold their pitiful lives in our hands.  Why would we willingly give unto others this same type of control over us?  <br>
<br>
Hecate conjured up an image of the night sky, filled with innumerable amount of twinkling stars.<br>
<br>
::In my visions, I saw mortals reach up into the heavens.  They yearn for the power which is ours by birth.  And yet when they tread upon the ether, they find nothing there.  And why is that, Hades?  Because they have killed us!!  Because they no longer believed  in us, and so we had faded away.  We are not there to greet them when they have achieved such greatness.  Instead, they find dead worlds and dead dreams.  Just think Hades.  If we can mold these humans, we can usher in a golden era, not of mortals, but of immortals.  There are worlds out there, amongst the stars, filled with life, yet lacking in guidance.  These worlds need us gods to shape them, to lead them on their evolutionary paths.  But we are relegated to this world, anchored here because this is where our worshippers are.  If we can transplant them onto those worlds, so goes us.  Our powers would grow, our reach unlimited.  No longer would we squabble over the handful of humans on this planet.  No longer will we quibble over who the Amazons worship, over which deity is the patron of which city.  We will have planets and star systems for our playground.  Just think, we will have control over vastness beyond imagine!!  But only if we are our own masters.  <br>
<br>
She points into the darkness within the temple.<br>
<br>
::Yet those witches refuse what is rightfully ours.  Instead they play us against each other, while they laugh at our ineptitude and foolishness.  They are your enemies, Hades, not me.  If you will not do this for yourself, then do this for Persephone.  I know she would agree with me.  For she is a loving wife and daughter.  Would she wish to see the two she loves above all else, fade into inexistence, if she had the power to stop it.  No!  She would not!!  She would fight to the death to prevent such a thing.  But would you?  Would you let your dear Persephone die?  Hades think things through.

&quot;Yes, the gods quibble and fight for followers and the beliefs and the hearts of these mortals? Have you ever noticed Lord Hades in ANY of those fights for them. Never. As I said before. 'Everything dies.' And thus when they die, they fall under MY jurisdiction. I have fewer priests than most. Most fear to even speak my name for fear of me hearing them, and yes, I do hear them when they speak my name.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay. Yet again, Hypothetically. We both attain ultimate power. We can do anything and everything. What happens when you and I come to a disagreement? Do we discuss it?

Hecate cocked her head a little to the side.  They had an audience after all.  Judging from the power emanating from the corner, most likely it was Hypnos.  So be it, let him dwell within the shadows.  Maybe Hypnos could be of help.<br>
<br>
::Hades, do you balk at taking this path because you feel everything has to come to an end?

Hecate shook her long ebony tresses, and sighed deeply.<br>
<br>
::Hades, you lose at the end.  If all us gods should perish, to whom can you gloat to?  To whom can you show your triumph to when no one else is around to be impressed?  Take the initiative Hades, take your destiny into your own hands.  That's what being a deity, a god is all about.  We rule our own destiny.  If you have sucha fatalistic view, why don't you give up your rulership over the dead now?  I am sure many of the other gods are salivating over what you reign, and none of them would give a second thought in grabbing your powers for themselves.<br>
<br>
Hecate sneered at Hades.<br>
<br>
::Well mighty Hades, what say you?  If life is finite, and our destinies predetermined, then why wait til then?  If you already forsee others taking over your governship, then why not step down now?  <br>
