Rumor was that her mother was also owned by him but was forbidden to see her baby.  Nadia's mother was only 15-years-old when she was born, and escaped at the age of 17 to the Amazon Nation.<br>
<br>

Ever sense Nadia could walk she was trained to be a gladiatrix.  But as she grew up the gladiator fights grew unpopular.  These actions began to piss Mars, the Roman War God, off.  He found a 13-year-old gladiatrix-in-training, who has became a better archeress than the regular adult gladiatrix.  Mars was looking for a gladiatrix to make the Emporer of Rome to fall in love with, and she was his last resort.  Sadly, she was skinny, tall, and just plain.  No man would ever want her.  So, Mars, with the help of Venus, changed her appearince a bit, causing her to look 5 years older and beautiful.<br>
<br>

With the emporer falling into Mar's plan, and falling in love with Nadia, he agreed to have the gladiator battles back so he could see her more often.  As the battle carried on, she gained the alias, Golden Archeress.    For two years she had not lost a battle, and now gladitor fights were back in their prime.<br>
<br>

When Nadia had just turned 15, she won a regular gladiator battle as usual.  But oddly, the emporer had requested that she see him afterwords.  He was planning on making her the new emperess of Rome, and she knew it.  When Mars found out, he sent men down to kill her.  But she escaped from his men and began to run towards Greece, for she couldn't stay in Rome.<br>
<br>

On the way, while she was still in the outskirts of Rome, she was visited by Mars and he told her that if she was to return then he would kill her.  So, she agreed and began her way to Athens, because it was oddly calling her that way.  
<br>
<br>
When she was in the outskirts of Athens, she had lost all her strength for she hadn't had much food and drink during her travels and Nadia had no more energy to even move.  A few minutes after she collpased, and strange woman came a picked her up and carried her into a near by tavern.  The woman took her to a bed in the back where she rested up.
<br>
<br>
The next morning, when she woke up, her and the woman introduced each other, finding out that Nadia was the woman's daughter.  The woman was the Amazon High Priestess of Athena, Sarabi A. Falco.  And it had been Athena calling her to her temple so Nadia could be reunited with her mother, and become an amazon as well.</span></div>	</div> 	<div id="contactinfo">		<h2>My Contact Information</h2>		<div id="email"><span class="title">Email Address ::</span>  <span class="privatevalue">private</span></div>		<div id="pm">		<span class="title">My Inbox ::</span> 						<span class="value"><a href="" title="Send a message using the ezboard inbox feature" >Send me a Message!</a></span>				</div>		<div id="im"><span class="title">IM ::</span> <span class="value">None - </span></div>		<div id="link"><span class="title">Personal Link ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="" target="_blank">My Personal Link</a></span></div>		<div id="recentposts"><span class="title">Recent Posts ::</span> 										<span class="value">		<dl>				<dt><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm69.showMessage?topicID=1.topic&index=3" title="post" target="_blank">Re: o.O help</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm69" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Athens</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm69.showMessage?topicID=1.topic&index=1" title="post" target="_blank">Fleeing.</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm69" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Athens</a></em></dd>				</dl>				</span>				</div>	</div>	<div class="spacer"></div> </div>  <!-- profile footer --> <div id="footing">© Copyright 1999-2003 <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/">ezboard, Inc.</a> All rights reserved.</div></div></body></html><!-- CSS:XHTML 2002 JR.o -->
