Their enemy had been defeated in battle and the Amazon name lived on.<br>
<br>
It had been another victory for Queen Alysia as she returned to her village to remain. During the war she had a feeling that Eli had vanished. Perhaps to Utopia which he spoke of so greatly, or perhaps just away.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, it was over. She had felt like she needed to choose between Eli and the Amazons. Alysia could never truly love a man who didnt accept her children as his own. And her main focus now was on Belle. <br>
<br>
And so, the Queen rose in through the city gates upon her white mare, the Princess riding at her side and the warriors behind them both. It had been a victory for the Amazon Nation as a Whole.<br>
<br>
She whispered words under her breath as she looked upon the ground of her lands.<br>
<br>
&quot;To a strong Amazon Nation.&quot;<br>

<br>
She couldn't help but grin as she thought about the war, the defeat. She'd told everyone who'd heard about the war that the Amazons would prevail in the end... that the Amazons would always prevail, and that she had faith in her Athelfi, and they had indeed came out on top, just as she and many others expected they would.<br>

Such a tug-of-war it was... but she didn't return with the rest of the amazons.  When the war was done, she had taken apart her tent and gathered things from the battlefields.  So many bodies... So many puddles of blood... The battlefield was nothing but a blanket of them.  Some were sliced in half through the torso, others ha been removed of their heads, others had been beaten senseless and others look beyond gruesome.  It practically broke her heart afterwards.  She had a feeling that this war could have been well prevented in the many years of the past, but couldn't quite place her fine on why.<br>
<br>
She had gathered the thing she needed and gotten on her tiger, enchanting all of her things to become feather light.  And off she went.  She was heading to Chakipolis Island, her brother Cupid's own island.  It was probably deserted and crumbling and she had an idea of what to do with that island. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualysiaofscynthia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alysia of Scynthia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 219<br> <font color=#993300>(9/1/01 7:07:36 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Making an Announcement</span><hr size=1> Alysia dismounted her horse making her way to the center of the village where she stood before her sisters and smiled proudly.<br>

&quot;Athelfi! Sisters of Scynthia! We have once again showed that no one dares to threaten our tribe. Though death and war is never a good thing, this war has united many of us and for that I am thankful!&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled down to Dawn and Belle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tonight, we feast and celebrate our Victory!&quot;<br>
<br>
Cheers were heard through the tribe as the fire was lit in the center of the village and the athelfi immediatly began dancing around the flames. <br>
<br>
A few of the hunters that had stayed behind, quickly brought out meats and fruits of all variety placing them on a long table at the side of the Main Hut in the village.<br>
<br>
&quot;Amazons Unite!&quot;<br>
<br>
She cheered loudly raising her fist in the air before she stepped down and walked over to her daughter.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm going to go get ready.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled lightly and went off to the Queen's Hut where she was able to change out of her battle clothes and into her regular leathers. She took of the golden belt and placed it in a safe trunk where she always had it. <br>
<br>
With a few new feathered braids in her hair and a bit of ritual dancing paint on her body, she walked back out to join her sisters in the dancing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 322<br> <font color=#993300>(9/1/01 10:05:56 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Celebration. </span><hr size=1>  Dawn sighed lightly, as she stretched abit.

<br>
Sat between the Scynthians, she raised her cup, saying:<br>
<br>
&quot;To our victory, to the Amazon Nation!And to all of you, athelfi&quot;<br>

After joining the dance, she says goodbye to her Scynthian athelfi.She was hurried to return in her homeland of Themiscrya, even if she would like to stay in the Northern Lands some more days.<br>
