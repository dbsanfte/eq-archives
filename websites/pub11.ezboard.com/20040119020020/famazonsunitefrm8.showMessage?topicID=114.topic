The day was still fresh on her and teh autumn breeze rang through the air happily carrying leaves around with it. She smiled as she looked from each amazon tribe to the other. She stopped when she got to Sarmatia. A slight frown because they werent very active. She hadnt seen one of them in the village as of late or in the forests hunting and preparing themselves for the winter season. She knew the Queen was away for awhile, but it didnt mean the whole tribe had to be vacant in there own way.
