Either way, she felt like killing, and felt like getting out of Themiscrya for awhile, and she knew Sartha probably felt the same on the latter part. <br>
<br>
 Slipping down out of the saddle of her horse, she gently pushed it off down the opposite direction of the way she and Sartha were traveling. It was only an hour or so from the camp site. . <br>
<br>
 Dawn tossed her sword and scabbard into a tree limb, and anything else she had that was nosy and started down the river bank.

<br>
 The assassin slipped silently into the camp, and unnoticed. Once she found the main tent, of Toman she stepped inside. Yes, this caused the warlord to glance over to her. Thank the gods he wasn't entertaining someone.<br>
<br>
 Dawn's emeralds glanced over Toman, as she smiled, saying nothing, as he grunted softly and began to speak.<br>
<br>
 &quot;What do you want, and who let you into my camp?&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn shrugged lightly, as she stepped closer. The stupid warlord's sword was three feet from his side, and would be very useless.<br>
<br>
 &quot;No one let me in, and I want you dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn growled, launching over the table between them, and slamming a dagger hilt into the warlords skull. Instantly the leader yelled, for his guards. Dawn had to act fast.<br>
<br>
 Dawn glared at the man before her, as another dagger joined her hands, and without hesitating the two blades slammed into Toman's shoulders, slicing through the bone. <br>
<br>
 Toman screamed in pain, as Dawn twisted the blades around, and then as she pulled them out, she sliced his throat. The daggers were tossed to the ground, in the blood, on the blade, Dawn's name was inscribed. . as well as her position. <br>
<br>
 And as the guards ran into the tent, she ran out the other side, and into the woods, to find Sartha... still soaked in the males blood.<br>

He wasn't sure if it was one of Tomans men or someone else...he went inside is small yet able to stand in tent, and took out a short stub of bamboo stick with a small light weight pot on the end of it. With a move of his hand on the small stub, a spark spring up and ignited a small compartment of the magic black powder.
