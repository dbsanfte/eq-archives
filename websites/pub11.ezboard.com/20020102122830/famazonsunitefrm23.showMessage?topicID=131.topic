Infront of the Amazon was a pole, on one side hung a dummy, on th eother side hung a sand-filled punching bag.<br>
<br>
 It seemed like wherever Dawn was, frequiently, there would be a training ground as well.<br>
<br>
 Wiping the back of a taped hand, across her foredhead Dawn sent another kick of her barefoot into the punching bag. Drawing her hands back up to a protect her face, she sent a right hook into the bag, following her kick. Bare feet shifted in the dirt as she moved, continue the sequence, with different moves, and attacks.<br>
<br>
 The hours of training rolled on, in the hot sun. The sweat continued to run down over Dawn's body, as she worked. Hot days were always good for two things, atleast she was doing one, and you didn't need a partner to do it..either. <p>

Ridding her brow of sweat with another swipe of the back of her hand. Emeralds turned to gaze down at her knuckles, under the white tape, blood had begun to form from the hard hours of training. Even her toes and places on her feet were starting to cut, and bruise. The assassin had over worked herself and it showed. <br>
<br>
 Even in the equipment, the dummy was torn and battered, and the punching bag had to be replaced on the hook many times after it was kicked off. <br>
<br>
 Dawn stood there, staring in disbelief. A entire day and a half of straight training.. how did this happen? She didn't even remember it getting dark and then light again... <p>

 Dawn knew all the reason why her knuckles were worse than what showed. So she slowly untaped them. Somewhere in her training, she had taped them again, and somewhere along the lines she had used her claws.. to much.. <p>

<br>
 Dawn kneeled, and then settled back onto her bum. Slowly she began to wrap her foot, like a gymnist. When she was done she stood.<br>
<br>
 The Assassin began walking toward a tree, grabbing a staff as she went. Grabbing onto a limb of a tree, she pulled herself in, bringing the staff with her.<br>
<br>
 The arches of her feet conformed to the branch, so that she was steady. Before long, the moments of silence were broken as Dawn worked with the staff. Twisting, swinging, whatever trick there was with a staff, Dawn knew them all. Even a few signature move of other Amazons.  <p>
