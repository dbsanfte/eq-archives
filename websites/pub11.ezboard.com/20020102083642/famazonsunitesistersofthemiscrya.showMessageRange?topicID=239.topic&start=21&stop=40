Thusly her step lightened, and wasn't as silent as the assassin she was. A soft glance was cast to Sartha as she felt the tone, giving a nod, and gesture of her eyes.<br>
<br>
 ~What do you expect? More women?~<br>
<br>
 Dawn wiggled her nose lightly, before eeking when a male slapped her on the behind as she wandered past. <br>
<br>
 Wide eyes went to Sartha, as she attempted to fight back the urge to send the male into a tree. The wide greens, weren't that of a freak response, but that if one who was trying to control her urge to fight. <p>
