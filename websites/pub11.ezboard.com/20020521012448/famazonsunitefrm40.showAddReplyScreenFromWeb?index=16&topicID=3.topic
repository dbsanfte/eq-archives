Lysippe, lived and breathed death and destruction, it was all she knew. Stupid guards and there backs to her, standing to close to the door, typical arrogent Roman, typical arrogent male. But she bide her time. She drew small figures in the dirt from her seated position, her blue eyes blank, revealing nothing. Her lips sat in a small smirk. She was a child of the earth, and she could feel that something was about to happen, of yes, she knew the moment that her sister found out about her, she could feel it, like a door opening. She knew her sister was comming for her. She knew little of Varia, she remembered very little, she was very young when there parents died and she was taken from Varia by that evil amazon Queen who Lysippe called mother for 17 years. But the Queen did teach her alot, alot that she now used. She giggled slightly, but afterwards, kept quiet, sitting in the dirt...smirking.*~* <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamazonlysippe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amazon Lysippe</A> at: 2/19/02 1:34:58 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=royalfogstone>Royal Fogstone</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#993300>(2/18/02 5:06:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> waiting</span><hr size=1> ***Fogstone was outside of the jail cell window wearing his black cloak and mask and reading Lysippe thoughts, and also sensed that some amazons were coming... <br>
