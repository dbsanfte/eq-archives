He had been traveling so much lately. With work in the Weaponry Shop, his duties around Greece as the Dark Wolf, and traveling the Amazon Lands learning and growing still in wisdom and skill . . . he hadn't had time to go back to XVH in so long.<br>
He wanted to make it there before Graduation to see Angel, but a murderer in Thebes caught him off gaurd.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stay here with me a few days or something.&quot; He smirked. &quot;Besides, Athens isn't much to go home to.&quot; He laughed a bit.<br>
<br>
Wulf's home in Athens was behind the weaponry shop, about a block down from Belle's club and not to far from XVH. He wanted it that way so that while Jadeyn stayed at his house, she would still be close to Belle and the others.<br>

 Angel nodded repeatedly. Even she couldn't wait for Wulf to go home and see it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daughterofshylock>Daughter of Shylock</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.picturesof.net/_wallpaper/rose_Dsc08151_WP.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 423<br> <font color=#993300>(5/19/03 5:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm65.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> He smiled softly, calmed a bit mroe now.

&quot;Well, I'm going to retire for the night. You joining me?&quot; He grinned winking her way a bit teasing.

<br>
 Angel giggled teasingly, before smiling at Wulf.<br>
<br>
 It'd been so long since they'd had time together, time where they could show their love for eachother. It was odd how those two, of all the couples had lasted, and come together to be one with eachother.<br>
<br>
 For a moment Angel's gaze fell into thinking of those nights, and then in silence she placed a gentle, tender kiss upon Wulf's lips. Pulling back she stood, taking his hand into hers before whispering.<br>
<br>
 &quot;But of course m'dear, I'll retire with you. I'll spend the evening reaqainting myself with your body, and your love. Because I've missed every moment of our being together.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Angel fell silent, waiting for Wulf's response. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daughterofshylock>Daughter of Shylock</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.picturesof.net/_wallpaper/rose_Dsc08151_WP.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 436<br> <font color=#993300>(5/22/03 8:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm65.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.picturesof.net/_wallpaper/rose_Dsc08151_WP.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Retiring.</span><hr size=1> He grinned returning the kiss passionatly and then looked deep into her eyes as he then took her hand leading her back towards the room he was staying in.

<br>
He glanced to her Orio-Patan markings and attire and then to his Blood Brothers &quot;Pack&quot; tattoo on his arm and smirked.<br>
<br>
&quot;A Tiger and a Wolf, what could possibly come of this?&quot;<br>
He grinned and kissed her once again. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">~*~ Jessica ~*~<br>

 &quot;You came from them. You came from a woman so dark, and evil that only Ares has tamed her. You came from a woman so deep and apart of this Earth, that only one as formed could be with her. They created the only man I could love, the only perfect being. What bad could come of this?&quot;<br>
<br>
 Angel shut the door to their room, before watching Wulf.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I've missed you.

<br>
 &quot;You can't worship someone that you're equal with. You are my equal. You walk this world by my side, with me. If you walked it a step ahead of me, or a step behind me, this wouldn't be love.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Angel gently kissed his lips, her fingers trailing over his face, and down his neck.<br>
<br>
 &quot;That's why I love you. I love everything you do, everyone you help, every part of you. From your lips.&quot;<br>
<br>
 The young teen gently trailed her fingers over his lips.<br>
<br>
 &quot;To your hands, that fight for the greater good.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Angel gently slipped her hands into his, squeezing lightly.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I love all of you, because you're everything I've ever wanted, ever needed.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left
