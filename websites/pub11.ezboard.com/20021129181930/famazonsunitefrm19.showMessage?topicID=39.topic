A light smile crept across her lips, and she laughed below her breath. This was a happy moment for the young girl, this was her chance to follow in the foot steps she was so afraid to follow in the beginning.<br>
<br>
 Around the outer edge of the circular stage, was the blood, the blood that had been spilled the night that she was intiated. The blood that Angel and Belle had used to spill their innocence. It was the blood of the men who attacked the empty village. She glanced over, every drop, almost, nodding satisfied that the girls had done a good job with it. It would be a rememberance.<br>
<br>
 &quot;This is for you mother. The Man-Slayers cannot die.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Lilla grinned proudly, falling to her knees in the darkness of the village, she let out a loud roar. It was just like her mothers, in a matching tone.. Lilla was the last of the shapeshifters in her family (aside from Wulf), she was the last true black demonic tiger.<br>
<br>
 The Orio-Patan Man-Slayers seemed to be the worst of the amazons, the ones whose murdered, killed, assassinated, any male figure that walked through the village gates without a reason. Infact, that's how Dawn was, and she had been a perfect example of an Orio-Patan amazon. Lilla would not allow the perfect dream her mother had set up, to die. It was a shame the place had become this forgotten, especially by a sister-city like Scynthia.<br>
<br>
 &quot;To my mother, to my friends, to my husband, to those who loved my mother. This is for her, in her choices, in her heart, and in the skill that she learned so easily and so blood thrusty.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Lilla whispered softly, dropping off the circle to drift off into the darkness. She was the perfect likeness of her mother, even in features. Lilla was blonde, brown eyed, same height as her mother, black leathers, and amazon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualysiaofscynthia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alysia of Scynthia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 371<br> <font color=#939393>(7/21/02 5:07:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Wulf</span><hr size=1> A large white wolf headed into the village and through the tigers that roamed freely in the lands. He blinked and listened to the roar of his sister. He missed that sound greatly. Perhaps this visit to Orio-Pata would do him some good.<br>
<br>
He made his way over towards his sister and bowed his head as low as he possibly could in respect of her.<br>
<br>
Telepathically, they could speak as he was in wolf form.<br>
<br>
~It is good to see Orio-Pata full of Mother's spirit once more.~ He grinned. ~The Nation has missed the tribe greatly. Mother gave great protection to peacekeeping tribes, and though Scynthia does it's best. . . nothing will ever beat the slaying power that drives an Orio-Patan.~<br>
<br>
Wulf was both of course. Scynthian and Orio-Patan. Scynthians were warriors but were more intune with spiritualistic things of nature and powers. While he got many powers and knowledge of such from Scynthia, his true bloodlust and warrior skill came from Orio-Pata. And though few knew it, Wulf loved the hunt and kill much like his Darkshade family. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uauthenticpansy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AuthenticPansy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#939393>(7/21/02 2:37:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wulf</span><hr size=1>  Lilla glanced casually to her half brother, slowly making her way along the village paths to light a few torches for those who would soon decide to make Orio-Pata home again.<br>
<br>
 ~Orio-Pata will never be like Mother made it. But it will be in her name that it is made.~<br>
<br>
 Lilla smiled proudly, both to herself and to Wulf. She sounded dipolmatic and almost like Dawn. Her statements were true, and one day maybe even Dawn would return.. although doubtful.<br>
<br>
 Slowly she stopped at the Queen's hut, the hut her mother had occupied before her leave and her death. She sighed lightly, running her hand over the carvings on the outside. It was something to be proud of, to have this legacy past on. <br>
<br>
 Orio-Pata would soon gow again, and it would rise to do its job once more.<br>
<br>

In respect for them, his sister, and mother, he shifted into his tiger form and pawed his way towards Lilla. He stopped outside the Queen's hut. He may be royalty in a manner of such, but it was forbidden for a man to enter the hut of any amazon, and he knew that.<br>
<br>
He smiled lightly to her words and nodded. He could already guess who she had chosen.<br>
<br>
~Sister, I shall remain in Orio-Pata for as long as you allow me to stay.~<br>
<br>
He loved Lilla truly. She was his sister and thus, apart of him. Though Orio-Pata would never be like it was with Dawn as Queen, he knew that this would be something he wanted to be apart of. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=thermodosa>Thermodosa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#939393>(7/28/02 12:49:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/ithermodosa/017.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Faded steps</span><hr size=1> &quot;Did you think it would be that easy to walk in here and claim such a position?&quot; From the shadows rasped a voice long unused, thick with trail dust, strong, most definitely feminine, familiar yet strange and void of emotion. &quot;Blood doesn't make it your rite, pup.&quot;<br>
<br>
Unearthly silver orbs appeared within the ebon depths.  The albino pushed away from the wall stepping forward from the shadows created by a nearby hut.  Focused on the woman before her she didn't acknowledge her friend's son or the possible danger presented from the tigers.  She was known to the magnificent beasts as a friend of Dawn, and a member of Orio-pata yet she had come unannounced.<br>
<br>
Locking her eyes upon the daughter of her dear friend, she circled slowly her palms keeping away from the weapons that adorned her armored frame.  It had been recently that she had seen Dawn, and then heard of the 'rebirth' of the tribe she once called home. Earlier she had crossed the circle of blood and remained hidden from all senses.<br>
<br>
Locking her jaw, the albino stopped in front of Lilla tourch-light playing across her pale features.  Thick black bands adorned her features, her wore the paint of war in tribal designs across her eyes, cheek and down her neck.  Weapons shone with being freshly cleaned, armor flawless in it's appearance. The assassin nodded to herself as if coming to a realization from staring deep into the eyes of Dawn's daughter.<br>
Without warning she drew her sword silver orbs glowing as they narrowed.<br>
<br>
&quot;But, then again, I've never known what I'm talking about.  I know where you came from.&quot;  The albino's eyes glinted in silent humor and she lowered her tall frame to one knee, sobering instantly. &quot;My sword, my arm, my mind, my pledge to My Queen, if it is found worthy.<br>
<br>
Locking her jaw once more, the stoic albino thrust her sword into the dirt before Lilla.  Removing her hand she braced her arm against her raised knee as she lowered her head in respect. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uauthenticpansy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AuthenticPansy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#939393>(7/28/02 3:47:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Faded steps</span><hr size=1>  Lilla's prideful gaze had turned to stone, as Thermodosa had made her appearence. Dark hazels had followed her merely around her in the circle the assassin had walked, and returned almost every bloodful moment that other had tossed outward.<br>
<br>
 Of course when she bowed, and kneeled, Lilla knew who she was. Dawn had spoke once of the assassin, telling Lilla it was almost a neccesity to have 'Dosa around the village and tribe, as well as urging her it would be helpful in times of decision making to have an elder such as Thermodosa. <br>
<br>
 &quot;Welcome Home. You're Queen finds no need for you to kneel in her recognition. My mother would not have it that way, and I shall not either, nor shall my brother.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Lilla's gaze looked to the animal at her side, the one whom she'd been speaking with telepathically before. She nodded to them both, with a smile.<br>
<br>
 &quot;We've got alot of work to do. But I think we'll do just fine. I think we'll do my mother proud. Her legacy will be hard to live up to, and I dare not exceed it. This was her world.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Lilla glanced once more to her brother, she knew, in Wulf's mind that she could never be what Dawn was, and she would never try, but Orio-Pata had to be what Dawn wanted it to be. No one but a Darkshade could help put that into motion.<br>

With his introduction, he stepped forward, paws down and bowed his head to her. Speaking telepathically to them both he stated:<br>

She did have her work cut out for her. But the road to success for Orio-Pata had always been a long and treterous one, even if Lilla had not been around to see the beginnings, she had been fully told of them. For a moment she glanced to her feet, feeling a bit of defeat and guilt in what her mother had intrusted her to do. Perhaps she was not cut out for it.<br>
<br>
 *Lilla You'll Do Fine.* Dawn's voice slipped into Lilla's thoughts, bringing back the moment when she had talked to her mother about taking on the position and tribe. She shook her head, brushing the thought of defeat away from her ideals. A Darkshade would not fail at this, nor would an amazon. Lilla knew better than to accept this act.<br>
<br>
 &quot;You'll both be staying.. right?&quot;<br>
<br>
 Lilla's voice was hopeful, as she wasn't quite use to going at this task alone. It would still be a few weeks before she intiated her Co-Queen, and Princess, and she was not prepared to stay by herself in Orio-Pata until then.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I'll need some help preparing for the ceremonies, to intiate, as well as getting some guidance on them. I'm sure you're both full of that sort of help?&quot;<br>
<br>
 Her voice had grown back to the steadyness that she had when she first spoke to them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=thermodosa>Thermodosa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#939393>(7/28/02 8:57:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/ithermodosa/017.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Helping hand</span><hr size=1> Watching Lilla's face the assassin cracked a true smile and shruged an armored shoulder.  &quot;I can't think of anything else better to do.

<br>
~I will stay for as long as she needs me here.~<br>
<br>
Orio-Pata was his home. He felt needed here. Even in Scynthia he knew that everything was fine. Alysia had both Belle and Odessa at her side, and with the news of the other childrens return, Scynthia would surely be packed. Not to mention the Wolf Pack had both Aeceus and Scythe to lead them.<br>
At least in Orio-Pata he felt truly apart of the Tiger clan.<br>
