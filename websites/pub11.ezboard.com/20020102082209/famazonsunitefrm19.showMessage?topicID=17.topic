He came in quietly trying not to disturb anyone.<br>
<br>
A few of the newer amazons who did not know of the young boy, were a bit weary of his pressence. Being the &quot;Man Slaying&quot; Amazons, they did not like him being there either.<br>
<br>
As a few of the younger sisters jumped out from behind some trees with staffs knocking him off of the horse. He landed on his feet easilly. He understood their concern, and trying to tell them who he was wouldn't work at all. He figured he'd let them have the fight they wanted, and eventually either they'd figure it out. . .or get tired and give up.<br>
<br>
One of the younger ones swung her staff towards his chest. Bad move. Wulf immediatly caught it in his hands pulling it from her and swinging it gently underneathe her feet sweeping her to the ground. <br>
<br>
He sighed at their training. Orio-Pata was relatively a new village considering comparison to Themiscrya. But that would soon change, for the new amazons in Orio-Pata weren't exactly the Man-Slayers he had hoped to meet.<br>
<br>
A few hours later the younger sisters were all on the ground and Wulf hadn't even broken a sweat. He looked down to the sisters. &quot;I hope I haven'y harmed you in any way.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nope, none of them were hurt. . .except for their pride of course.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Good, then do me a favor and tell your Queen that her son has come to see her.&quot;<br>
<br>
O.O<br>
<br>
Of course they immediatly took off. They were not bound to tell their Queen anytime soon that they had tried to kill her son.<br>
<br>
Wulf sighed and mounted the horse again and began riding towards the Queenb's hut. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Queen</span><br>  Posts: 126<br> <font color=#939393>(6/8/01 9:07:01 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Entering Orio-Pata</span><hr size=1>  Dawn had watched Wulf enter, beat her young'ns at the fight. As soon as he stopped and stood dusting himself off the Queen had stepped from her hut, thus the main reason why the younger Amazons rushed after Wulf spoke of whom he was. The Amazon Queen hooked her thumbs into the back pocket of her leathers as she walked over to Wulf with a grin.<br>
 &quot;Hello my son..welcome to Orio-pata.&quot; <p>Pyschotic injustice

Don't worry it won't hurt..
Just a dagger or two.. 
Crimson spilling onto my hands..
Running over the flesh to drip from my elbow
Scarring the black leather pants..

 &quot;Yes I suppose the trainees are getting better. How is your training going?&quot;<br>

 Dawn grew abit more concerned as she looked at him.<br>

 &quot;You haven't had any changes have you?&quot;<br>

 Yes Sartha hadn't gotten acqainted with Wulf, now was perhaps the time to do it, he was a good boy. <p>Pyschotic injustice

 &quot;They will come M'Dear. Perhaps its just that you haven't had someone train you so that you will attack the certain areas of your brain that will trigger your powers.&quot;<br>
<br>
 The Queen smiled abit more, she knew there were probably more logical reasons to answer the question as of why Wulf was not getting his powers. Wanting them was less of a problem. <br>
