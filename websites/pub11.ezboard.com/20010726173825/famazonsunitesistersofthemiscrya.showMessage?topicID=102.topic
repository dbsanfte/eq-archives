He ducked his head out of the way and then sent his blade towards her.  She quickly caught it in her own.

And Hipp flipped her scimitar to a better angle then quickly guided her scimitar into his chest.   He staggered back and then fell olding his chest.  Hipp noticed a Centaur wearing the bandalier of a Centaur Leader was racing up the side of the sand dune with two others.  She urged Monsoon out of the fray of the camp and after them.  As she did she pulled out a dagger and sent it flying into the back of one of what was probably guards, just as they reached the edge of the forest. He growled and spun around.  The other two ran into the forest.  The lone Centaur returned Hipp's attack.  As Monsoon rushed towards him, he slung his great sword at the mare's knees.  A large crack was heard as this broke the mare's two front legs, sending both the mare and Hipp to the ground hard.  Hipp pushed herself up from the ground, wincing at feeling that her left arm was not broken from the fall.  She glanced quickly at Monsoon...and could see the mare struggling for breath.  The mare's neck was broken.  Brown eyes instantly filled with tears, and a Centaurs laugh was heard.  Hipp rushed him, sending her scimitar into his horse chest.  He gasped at the pain.  Hipp pulled the scimitar out and slashed again this time at his neck.  The Centaur's head went flying from his body which fell to the ground.  Hipp rushed quickly over to Monsoon::: Oh, girl...I am so sorry. ::she ran her fingers over the mare's face..brushing back the long mane away.  The mare continued to struggle for breath, almost whimpering as she did.  Then, suddenly, the breath ended. Hipp's eyes turned maddened to the forest.  She rose, her body shivering with fury.

The closer she would come the more she would feel a burning hatred for those that were her enemy in her eye's and through this hatred her ability's would increase and she would find herself running faster then she ever had. So swiftly her motions were when she dashed into the camp stooping just before a unsuspecting Centaur each Kama drawn out to the side and there she was crouched in her stance~ <br>
<br>
&quot; It is not a good day to die my unfortunate victim....&quot;<br>
<br>
~The Centaur just laughed at her, not taking the Angelic warrior serious at all~<br>
<br>
&quot; Please allow me to show you!!&quot;<br>
<br>
~ She cried out as she lunged forth bringing a Kama over head to drive into the center of the Centaur's chest slicing downward, spilling entrails as she cut the Centaur wide open, leaving it for dead she would spin round to set eye's upon three more that had began to approach her~<br>
<br>
&quot; You are all criminals... you violate a code of sacredness... now meet your Consequence!!!!! &quot; <br>
<br>
~ The Centaur's charged toward her letting out there cries of battle as they approached her. Azzepth's body would twist to the right clenching her Kama's as each blade would eulminate that icy blue color that reflected the misunderstood essence seen within her eye's. When she jerked to the side she would swing her arms projecting the Kama's and within there swirling motion they would become a cyclone of that very same glow that would project toward the three advancing toward her leaving a trail of a dim icey blue myst. As the Centaur's met the wrath of her unexplored power there cries of war would transform into screams of agony as the the slender iced blue circle cut through each at the waist severing there Torso's from the rest of there bodies one bye one. The Kama's would cut through them as if there were silk and boomerang back to Azzepth, to appear back within her hands. Just then a incredible pull was felt within her as if somthing was plucked form her, taken from her heart and she could feel the emptiness all more then she could bare, and that grimace of war upon her face twisted with pain and she whispered~<br>

Alysia rode into the Northern Forest quickly. But of course she was too late.<br>
Her fear was soon to be drowned out by the wailing of fallen amazons. She saw <br>
some that had fallen to their knees in anguish. Others were too weak too stand. <br>
Most were screaming in pain that was hidden in their souls. Alysia's was there too.<br>
<br>
She knew what had happened.<br>
<br>
The Queen was dead.<br>
<br>
Aly sank to the ground after dismounting Majestic. She then looked up and saw<br>
a dead horse. Her heart sank. &quot;Monsoon.&quot; She cried and then the tears poverflowed her.<br>
But as she looked up she recalled something Hipp once told her.<br>
<br>
*Alysia, of you are to become the greatest of amazon queens,<br>
you can't let one simple act destroy all that the Nation has fought for.<br>
If all amazon queens did that, we would be slaves to the men for all time.*<br>
<br>
Hippolyte was right. An anger overcame Alysia, one that she thought<br>
she would never see again. It was the anger that brought her out of Rome.<br>
She stood up and saw the Centaur army overlooking the weakend amazons<br>
planning to take them all back as slaves. <br>
Aly knew her destiny.<br>
<br>
She would lead the Army to victory and rid the amazons<br>
of the Centaurs forever.<br>
<br>
She stood and glanced at her fallen sisters with tears in her eyes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http:// http://members.nbci.com/xipinfo/season6/04-wg/Wg0163.JPG"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Amazons! Stand up! I will not let you fall and let Hippolyte's death<br>
go unpunished! Amazons stand and fight back! For Hippolyte! Amazons Attack!&quot;<br>
<br>
Alysia was the first to jump into battle, her sword was glowing brightly with<br>
the cronus stone in the hilt. She charged at the guards standing around the leader<br>
of the Centaurs. Her sword plunged into one guards while she brought out her crossbow and sent three arrows into the neck of another. She grinned evilly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Two down, two to go.&quot;<br>
<br>
She glanced back at the amazons that had risen form their sorrows and jumped<br>
into action spewing the blood of a thousand Centaurs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.nbci.com/xipinfo/season6/01-ch/CHa0044.JPG "><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Aly swung her sword across the chest of another guard and then leaped on the last<br>
pulling out her golden chakram slitting his throat.<br>
<br>
She smiled looking to the leader. She did reconize him. In the last Centaur war<br>
when she was just a girl. She had killed every Centaur she came in contact with.<br>
However this one was weak and she let him go, only leaving him with a nasty scar<br>
on his left cheek. She smiled and whispered in a harsh voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice to see you again. . .slash.&quot;<br>
<br>
A nickname he hated.<br>
<br>
He grinned and rose his hand into the air and yelled.<br>
&quot;Centaurs! Bring out the archers!&quot;<br>
<br>
More than ten centaurs came out with crossbows and spears and the amazons attacked<br>
them. The battle between Aly and Slash seemed to go on forever, and when she plunged her<br>
sword into his heart time seemed to stand still. <br>
&quot;You will never be feared by another amazons ever again.&quot;<br>
She relished his blood pouring over her hands.<br>
<br>
He coughed up blood.<br>
&quot;I already had one queen killed. I shall have you all.&quot;<br>
<br>
She stuck the sword in deeper and his eyes squinted from the pain.<br>
All of the amazons turned to see their victor. The Centaurs eyes widened in fear.<br>
They now knew their destiny was then to die.<br>
<br>
Slash took his last breath and raised his hand trying to motion a retreat<br>
but he failed and fell through Aly's blade. <br>
<br>
As she turned to resume the battle,<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.nbci.com/xipinfo/season6/01-ch/CHa0049.JPG "><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
 a Centaur lunged a spear towards her and the only sound that was heard over the forest, was Aly's sword hitting the dirt. She opened her eyes with a few amazons overlooking her trying to heal her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alysia, you are immortal you cannot die.&quot;<br>
<br>
She coughed and whispered. &quot;I am only immortal if I say I am. Let no one heal me, only my blood sister may bring my blood back to my soul.&quot;<br>
<br>
She turned her head and looked behind to see the spear pierciung the bark of a tree.<br>
She then felt the need to breath more than ever before in her life. The arrow had struck her lung. She mumbled out three last words before she left the world.<br>
<br>
&quot;For you . . . .Hippolyte.&quot;<br>
<br>
The amazon standing above her closed her eyes and looked back to the battling amazons.<br>
&quot;The war is ours, let no Centaur leave alive.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
*~* Through the battle a spirited horse ran by in gladness, followed by a white wolf.<br>
The war was in the victory of the amazons, and it was a good day ~*~<br>

<br>
She threw the sword, letting it slash one more centaur's throat before running to Aly and dropping to her knees. She kneeled over her, tears streaming down her cheeks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aly.. Aly, you're going to be okay..&quot;<br>
<br>
She broke the back of the arrow and quickly pulled it out. She applied some ointments and herbs from her bag, oblivious to the crowd's around her.<br>

She grieved as she cleaned and bandaged her quickly.<br>

There she would remain for a bit her thoughts taken off in a swirl of pain, anger, and comfort. She felt horrible as if she could not continue this, she wanted to run, she wanted to hide from this horrible reality yet the more she this fearful pain dawned on her it would slowly transform from pain to hate. She felt it deeper then she had ever, deeper then she felt it for her father, deeper then she felt it for those monks that had robbed her of her life. This deep erie hatred that she did not know existed within her grew, and as it grew stronger it would change once more into that of what she was but did not know it and the strong, powerful sense of vengeance began to pump through her veins fueling her heart with its awful black fury. Rage burned within her a defining spark at first that caught onto that hatred growing burning into a blaze and those eye's would widen and she would rise to her feet free of her friends grasps, now within a trance the only thought trapped within her mind was to kill. With all this racing through her head fueling her but not about to be let loose she would look to Callisto and with the look she possessed within those eye's her affection, her gratitude, the bond she offered and the comfort she felt could all be scene directed toward Callisto. Then the the fire within her would reach its horrid peak, Vengeance must be taken, they must pay for what they had done. She then walked past her friend and out of the hut stopping just before its entrance outside to scream as loud as she could~<br>
<br>
&quot; Your all going to die if I have anything to do with it!!!!!!! &quot; <br>
<br>
~ her legs began to pump and she moved like the breeze through the air and there was nothing that could stop her inhuman dash. To the battle toward the camp's her legs would take her faster then she had ever run before. Then the first of the centaurs would make the mistake of approaching her with attack on his mind. To slow was he for this trance she was in was to much of a powerful state of mind, not ever did she know what she was but know she did, and with the simplest gesture of swinging her arm that held her Kama, toward the waist of the Centaur, she would rip flesh open in a deep wound spilling entrails onto the ground leaving the Centaur to fall to the ground. Two Centaurs had a fellow Amazon traped between them, them both facing her the Amazon's back to Azz from where she charged from. Then she would leap into the air whirling as she went, holding each Kama out. In mid air she spun leaping over the Amazon as she caught both Centaur's necks against the blades of her Kama's loping each of there heads off. Her feet hit the ground and she was still going a Centaur charged her and she brought her Kama back in a over hand strike bringing the Kama to drive it down into the Centaur's gut impaling it before she ripped it from him jumping straight up into the air while swinging her Kama across its neck loping its head off. Once landed on her feet she would charge a Centaur from behind headed toward a fallen Amazon with great speed she caught up to him leaping forth high into the air and as she soured past him she swung her Kama out to catch the blade around the back of his neck removing its head from its shoulder, she landed and kept going. Her spree had caught the attention of three Centaur's headed straight for her, she would not stop nor would they and just then her eye's would flicker and the blade's of her Kamas would eluminate that same color of iced eyes just before she projected them in a kris cross and they would take flight into there slender glowing discs curving in mid air with the Centaur's in the cross fire, the discs would waste no time in flying straight for there necks decapting each in the blink of a eye, but this had caught the atention of four other's aproaching from behind her. It was instinct that she knew they were there and without even looking at them the icy blue glowing discs that were her Kama's were sent behind her to terror the four Centaur's heads from there body's just as they did the three before her boomeranging back to land within Azzepth's hands~ <br>
<br>
&quot; All of your lives taken bye my hands will never be enough to fill the gab in all of our lives you have made...... you have committed a crime, with a punishment that knows NO LIMIT and I am your executioner!!!!!! &quot; <br>
<br>
~ There she stood in the rain, her white leather soaked with the water's from above and the blood of the slain, standing there shouting out as she did, she would capture the attention of a fairly large group of Centaurs that would swarm around her twenty of them to be exact all waiting until she had finished before charging toward her all at the same time. She would crouch down holding her Kama's those blade's would glow as they did and when she burst up and projected them toward the Centaur's they would take there iced blue glowing disc forum. Being projected toward the Centaur's that advanced terroing through them taking life after life, those whom dodged the discs and made it to the angered Azz would suffer the fate of Azz leaping so swiftly up to them and around onto there back's taking a hold of there head's and twisting with all her might to snap there necks. A blind fury she was in and she did not even notice the several other Centaurs that would join the original twenty all she was now was a weapon like a bezzerker immune to there attacks she would latch onto each that came toward her that were skillful enough to dodge the discs that swarmed around a circle of Centaur corpses in a distinct pattern. Latching onto them going for the throat, those who she could not get behind to snap there neck's she would struggle with digging her nails into there throats ripping there flesh, and terroing out there throats coating her sun-kissed hands in blood, they came from every direction. They saw her as a challenge but she saw all of them as victims, after the second wave of seven came a third of twelve three hit bye the discs yet the rest that met Azz in the middle would lose there throats or have there neck's snapped. A final forth wave of five came and went and Azz stood there soaked in rain and blood as her Kama's would find there way to her hands once more. Standing there with a insane and blood thirsty glare upon a face that was so angelic, so welcoming. Now it was a face of Vengeance and she wanted to take it forth on them all~<br>
