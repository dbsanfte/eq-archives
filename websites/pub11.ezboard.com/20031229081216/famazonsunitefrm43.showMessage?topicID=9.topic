She waddled through the village with her little Sebastyan wrapped up in the softest rabbit leather.  His face was very pale, like the rest of his body, and he had two tiny black stripes pointing towards his face from his two pudgy cheeks.  The new born, which was now about 2 months old, rested silently in his mother's arms as she made her way to the gates of the village.<br>
<br>
Teygra was travelling to some merchants outside of the tribe's village.  She didn't understand why, but she had a feeling to go.<br>
<br>
After a while of walking you would've thought that the tiny and chubby shamaness would have taken a rest, but no, she went on.  Walking as fast as her little legs could carry her.<br>
<br>
Although, once the merchants were in sight of her, she took a small break.  But it wasn't her who was getting tired, it was Baby Sebastyan who was getting cranky.  So, she set down on a log near by and fed him.  After he was done she fixed her leathers and she was back on her way.<br>
<br>
When she reached the merchants she could tell they were all snickering at her.  But when one would stare at her she would snarl, showing her long feline fangs, and let it be known that she wasn't afraid to use what was to them, her &quot;deformities.&quot;<br>
<br>
She was being pulled to a tiny dark hut, towards the end of the rows of merchant huts.  As she approached the hut she had a mixture of good and bad feelings.  Sebastyan began becoming a bit uncomfortable from sensing the confusion in his mother, and Teygra could tell.  As she reached the hut she glanced around at everything.  It was a magick hut, dealt with the ways of the celts and of others the same way like herself.  She saw many charms made of symbols which were familiar to her.  There was a tiny woman standing in the hut, staring dead at Teygra as she shopped, and the shamaness knew.  She sensed an uneasiness from the merchant woman and moved her seagreen orbs to the woman.<br>
<br>
As their eyes met, the woman said what all other merchants say, &quot;How may I help you?&quot;  but Teygra sensed an uneasiness in her voice, almost...fear.  Teygra gently smiled attempting to ease the woman's distress, adjusting Sebastyan in her arms.<br>
<br>
&quot;No thank you, I am just looking around.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her orbs fell on a scroll with a bit torn off on the end behind the woman's head titled &quot;Bringing Back Lost Lover.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, if you don't mind, I'd like to see the old scroll behind you,&quot; Teygra points to the scroll with her only short arm free.  The woman did as she was told and handed it to Teygra.  As Teygra read she learned that it was a ritual to bring back a dead lover.  But before Teygra could finish reading it, the woman said, &quot;You can have that for free, that scroll has been nothing but the monkey's paw for me.  Take it, get it out of my site.&quot;<br>
<br>
Teygra reached in her pocket and placed four gold pieces out of genurosity and began her way back to the village.<br>
<br>
It was around late night when she made it back.  She looked down at the scroll once again and wondered if this is what was calling her.  As she made it into her hut, she placed Sebastyan down in his little wooden crib which consisted of many soft leathers.<br>
<br>
After putting Sebastyan to bed, she read over the scroll once again, planning the perfect time to preform it.  She placed the scroll down on a wooden table next to her bed and laid down.  As she stared at the top of her hut she began thinking of her dead husband.  She remembered meeting him, the contravorsy they caused between both the O'the Fire and O'the Wind families.  For he was to be the next clan leader for O'the Fire family, a rival to her O'the Wind family.  But they gave up everything for each other, which in the long run brought O'the Fire and O'the Wind to peace.  When she and her husband, Oliver O'the Fire, heard the news of their families coming to peace, came out of hiding and began their way back to their forests.  But on the way they were attacked by a larger animal and Oliver was killed.  But the night before they left, they had conceived, so Oliver left her to bare his child alone.<br>
<br>
Now she wanted him back and she would take care of him this time.  And being the Amazon Goddess of Maternity and Natural Conceiving and Birth, she needed a mate to help conceive a new child.  She has decided in three nights she will preform it.  Teygra will travel to her lost lover's grave and bring him back. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td
