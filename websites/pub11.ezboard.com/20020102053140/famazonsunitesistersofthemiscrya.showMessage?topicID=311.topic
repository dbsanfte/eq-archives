Hippolyte had plans for a sacred ceremony to be held on Ares Island.  And because of her health, she needed someone to arrange the preperations before all arrived.  Marpe felt very honored to take on the task requested of her.  And even more honored that it would be for the new vasilissa in Themiscrya.<br>
The guardian had selected one of the strongest white stallions from Hippolyte's herds and quietly left the village in the dark night.  If not for the pale glow of the hide of the stallion, she would not could not have been seen.  <br>
Marpe lead the stallion to a boat at the northern coast of Themiscrya.  She tied the horse to the end of the boat and then stepped into it and found a seat.  Glancing back to the horse that watched her a bit edgy she laughed and whispered.<br>
&quot;Allright, get ready to swim.&quot;<br>
Marpe grabbed the oars and began to paddle.  At first, she didn't go anywhere.  The horse wouldn't budge.  But, she placed the oars into the ground under the water and began to push with one hand and pull the lead with the other.  After a time, she was able to coax the stallion into the water and they began to set forth across the black sea to the Ares Isle that lay not too far from the coast. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 506<br> <font color=#993300>(12/6/01 5:08:00 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/hippster.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Coronation at Ares Island on the Black Sea</span><hr size=1> Gabby had finally fallen asleep beside Hippolyte.  It seemed hours until the golden bard beside her finally stopped chattering and allowed herself to go to sleep.  Hipp had waited and waited, she wanted to get out of bed and prepare for DeLerium's coronation.  But, Gabby would not let her out of bed.  Her partner was worried that the wound would reopen.  <br>
Gently, Hippolyte lifted the covers and set them aside...slowely moving her body out of the large bed.  The pain in her side began to burn, as she bit her bottom lip to fight away any sounds of pain.  Her body bent up straight as she could, and Hipp took in some slow quiet breaths to ease the pain back aside.<br>
Brown eyes shifted over to the curtains that held behind them the altar to Hera.  Taking a deep and slow breath...Hippolyte quietly made her way behind the curtains and to the altar.  Fingers lifted to push back a stray bit of careless auburn hair from her face as she gazed down into the mirror that lay at the feet of the large peafowl statue.<br>
"Great Hera," she whispered softly. "I need a favour of you and your son." <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

Her own powers of premonition working she knew what the small amazon queen was needing.  <br>
" I will speak with Hephaestus and see about getting the belt for the new queen," she replied.  "I will find a way to get a belt worthy of your new right hand."  <br>
Then just as suddenly Hera dissappeared from the mirror, leaving only the reflection of the Themiscryan queen. <p>~~<<<<<<{{{{@</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/umarpeamzn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Marpe Amzn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#993300>(12/8/01 6:40:51 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/MarpeAmznrpg.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Coronation at Ares Island on the Black Sea</span><hr size=1> Finally, the warrior guardian reached the shores of Ares Island.  Once the white stallion felt the earth under the water, he quickly walked up onto the land.  Marpe jumped out of the boat and looked to the trees.  She knew she was being watched by the island's guardians.<br>
&quot;I am Marpe of Themiscrya,&quot; she spoke loud and proudly. &quot;I have come for the great ritual and to prepare for the coronation of a new vasilissa in Themiscrya.&quot;<br>
Soon, the twelve who were watching walked out with smiles on their faces.  One of them took the lead of the stallion smiling, as one who seemed the leader greeted Marpe. &quot;Welcome back, athelfi.  It has been a while.&quot;  She gave Marpe an amazon salute.  For before Marpe stood amazon women who had given their lives as guardians of the unknown amazon temple to Ares.  <br>
The island had been a place of worship to the war god for many long years.  The only male diety sacred to most amazons as he was claimed to be the father of many leaders of the Amazon Nation.  This island held sacred rites for the amazons.  But only still few attended it in secret.<br>
The guardians lead Marpe and the stallion away from the shores and began to chat about what has been going on the main land.  They relied on the visits to let them know.  Marpe explained to them about the latest war with some of the Gods, and how Hippolyte had been wounded and the journey to the island would be difficult for her.   <br>
Soon, they came upon the simple temple to Ares and the priestesses came out to welcome the Themiscryan and the offering stallion.  They would help her feel at home and prepare for the great coronation that was to come. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 508<br> <font color=#993300>(12/9/01 9:16:19 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/hippster.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Coronation at Ares Island on the Black Sea</span><hr size=1> Hippolyte smiled as Hera appeared in the mirror.  She was not surprised that the Goddess had read her mind.  It had not been the first time.  Feeling weakened by being up for so long, Hipp was thankful that Hera knew and quickly ended the visit at the altar.  <br>
She turned and walked slowely back to her bed behind the large curtains.  The small queen would need rest before tomorrow, when she would announce the event to the village.<br>

She glanced over to Gabby's side of the bed and saw that her partner had left the bed.  Hipp realized it must be much later in the day, for Gabby was never one to rise and shine early.  Brown orbs glanced around and saw next to her bed a plate of bread and fruit along with a bottle of water sitting next to the large bed.  Her lips quirked to the side, as she knew Gabby wasn't allowing her wine until Hippolyte was moving around well enough to get it herself.  A deep long sigh sounded from her form as she just lay there and thought of the upcoming events.  Hipp wondered if Hephaestus would grant her request.  She knew the relationship between Hera and her son had never been close.  But, Hera was her patron goddess and Hippolyte hoped that she could help.  Besides, Hipp had not spoken with her father in over a year.  She had heard he had been in close contact with Dawn before the assassin's death.  And had even seen him in the war with the Gods.  But, even then...they had not spoken.  Hipp's eyes grew serious as she thought of this.  Now would not be the time to have spoken to him, as she lay wounded from a war.  The very thing he had taught her in. <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>
