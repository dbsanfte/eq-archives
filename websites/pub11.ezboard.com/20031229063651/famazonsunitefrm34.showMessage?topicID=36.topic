Zia, Lykopis, and Myrine had heard news that a few intruders have tresspassed onto the amazon lands. Well, they just could not have that, and they were there to protect the amazon lands of Lesvos. There home. They followed Queen Velaska's every rule, and would do as she said. They had woken the Queen early to let her know of the intruders, Velaska did not like to be woken to such news. She gave the order to destroy, and they would be happy to do so. They split up, not completley, but away from each other, and took to the tree's.  The Guards knew why the first Queen of Lesvos had picked this spot to build the fortress. The forest around them was deep and dark, with just enough light. Surrounding the forest, way off to the back, the forest was nothing but redwood trees. Massive giants to say the least. It made a good protection, and hiding place. As the guards went from tree to tree, they found what they were looking for. Two men, Both wearing the outfit of the usual greecian males. The Amazons of Lesvos Island where infamous, known highly, stories told througout generations about the barbaric, visious amazons who inhabited the island. There Queen, also known as the Bitch Offspring of God Ares, for he fathered each Queen Amazon Queen on this island, and had the warlike hand in there upbringing. Boys were warned since they day they could understand, to stay off of the Northern Site of the Island, for no men had ever lived to tell the tale of the Biches of Lesvos Island. And surely, these males as well, would not. But be left as a warning, by oder of Queen Velaska of what happens when you do not listen to warnings. <br>
<br>
Calls where heard from high upon the tree's , but the men insisted they were merely the call of birds, and other forest dwelling animals. In truth, it was the three amazon guards speaking to one another, forming there plan. As Zia shot her arrow into one of the males thigh, and Myrine shot the other, Lykopis would jup from the trees and begins with her rope. They needed to be alive for there punishment the Queen wanted done. <br>
<br>
As Zia, Myrine, and Lykopis dragged the males back to the shores by the fortress, they were met by other amazons of the island, watching, and laughing at the fate of those men. Some brought the supplies needed and helped with the punishment.<br>
<br>
The first male was turned onto his stomach, as the other was held at spearpoit by atleast five sisters who came to watch the early executions. Smiling, Zia, tied a strong rope around the middle of a long metal pole there smithy had made for just this porpus, It lasted longer then the wooden ones against the weather and the elements. Once the rope was secure, she laughed as the male was disrobed. Quickly, the sharpe top of the pole was inserted to the now screaming males rectum. A few of the amazons pulled at the ropes, as another stood by the male to make him raise with it. The pole was now erect, the male still alive as he slid slowly and painfully down inches, the sharp end ripping his insides apart. Vital organs had not been ripped through as of yet, and so he lived this horid fate until they were. The other male, watched horrified, as he knew, the same fate would befall him, and, in the manner it did his friend, it did to him as well. When they were finished, they secured the poles by the oceanfont, in a straight line.<br>
<br>
Zia, yrine, and Lykopia turned towards the fortress, swords raised, looking up to the window of Queen Velaska. They knew she watched, yet did not see the pleased smile on her lips. As Velaska shut the window drapes and vanished from veiw, the amazons on the oceanfront let out a loud cry of victory, as was custom on Lesvos.::: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamazonvelaska.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amazon Velaska</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_purplespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 237<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(8/6/02 4:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm34.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=36.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/amaz0nbich/images/smallvelaska.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Intruders captured</span><hr size=1> ~Later that day, as the crowd around th intruders went off to do there daily duties and sparring, Velaska came from her chambers, a smile on her lips. She could feel that she was making her mother proud. She was bringing back the ways of the Lesvos Amazons. The way it should be. She looked up at the impaled men, one was allready dead, the other, she could tell by his chest rising and falling that he still lived. She would watch the male die...painfully and slowly.~ <p>Queen Velaska of Lesvos Island

Climbing the steps of the fortress's dungeon, she stopped at the door, unlocking it to let herself out, and locking it behind her. Only one other had the other key, and that was Queen Velaska. Rubbing her soiled hands on her long black skirts, she followed the death out of the fortress and down the path to the beachfront. As she approached, she noticed Queen Velaska standing next to the implaed bodies of the two intruders. The other body of the boat captain who brought Hope to Lesvos was decaying nicely. A bright smiled appeared on her black lips as the demoness stopped besides the Queen and tilted her head, long black tendrils of hair swung to the side. In a very soft voice, deeply accented with Romanian, she looked up to the tall Queen.~<br>
&quot;Very nice my Queen, done right and on the first try, and it smells so lovely.&quot;<br>

<br>
As the boat touched the sandy beach, she had to lean over the edge of the boat to empty the contence of her stomach out into the water.  Breathing heavy, she wipped her mouth and stepped out of the boat.<br>
<br>
With a stubborn lock to her jaw, her shakey legs carred her out of the boat and onto the shore. Walking up to the dead men, she looked up, a single tear falling down her cheek.<br>
<br>
Walking over to a grassy area at the beach, she picked up two single flowers, and walked back to the men.  Placing one at each of the base, she looked up once more.  Taking in a slow breath, the older woman's lips parted and a hunting melody spilled from her lips.<br>
<br>
The mourning song was haunting, eerie and ment to bring peace to the dying, not the already dead.  As the song ended, the woman lowered her eyes, and found herself trapped in the stare of an Amazon.<br>
<br>
Though she didn't know Velaska she couldn't mistake the aura of authority that was in her posture.  She also knew she'd done something that wasn't liked.<br>
<br>
Without fear, she walked up to the Queen, and bowed her chin in respect.  Depthless blue eyes stared back without fear, or condemnation.<br>
<br>
&quot;I did it for their mothers, and families, not them.  I'm sure they deserved this....&quot; Her tone was rich, unreadable, slowly her eyes closed, and another tear spilled down her check.  Turning slightly she simplly walked past Velaska's shoulder and made her way from the carnage. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamazonvelaska.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amazon Velaska</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_purplespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br>  Posts: 258<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(8/25/02 11:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm34.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=36.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/amaz0nbich/images/smallvelaska.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: First Impressions</span><hr size=1> ~ Velaska watched in anger as the woman did her thing. Angry eyes held her in them, a twisted smirk sitting on her lips as she the woman, whom she knew as Cyrene said it was for there framily and not them, then abruptly walked off. She couldnt help but laugh a wicked laugh as she vanished towards the fortress. It was apparent she did not know that the amazon was the Queen of Lesvos...however...if she knew this and still acted in that manner towards her, there would be tartarus to pay....A crow swooped down plucking the eye out of the male she stood under and flew off. Velaska turned on her feel and walked off, to the back doorway of the fortress only she knew about.~ <p>Queen Velaska of Lesvos Island
