::Alysia sat in her throne smiling after a wonderful visit from her daughter Aliya. She was finally at peace. Meanwhile. .. . . . .<br>
<br>
<br>
In the Alternate Universe. . . . . .<br>
<br>
<br>
Sapphira sat on her high throne as the empress of the Roman legions in her area of ruling. She smiled down at her son who was sitting before the Gate that opened the portal to the other world. She smiled and ran a hand through her short blonde hair. <br>
<br>
&quot;The Amazons will never suspect us comming my child.&quot;<br>
<br>
The young boy looked to his mother. <br>
&quot;But what if this Wulf boy is stronger than I?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
She grinned. &quot;Just remember that if he kills you, he kills himself in the process. And that leaves the gate open forever!&quot; She cackled loudly.<br>
<br>
A knock was heard at her chambers.<br>
<br>
&quot;Enter.&quot; She yelled.<br>
<br>
A few Roman women entered the area. &quot;We are ready my leige.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sapphira smiled and looked to them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now remember, when we enter this world. You each will have another. . .a twin. . a mirror image if you will. Do not kill them or you yourself will be destroyed! But wound them very badly and then lock them up. In time you will heal and then when that happens, my son shall sacrifice the child called Wulf, and we shall remain in the Scynthia Village forever!&quot;<br>
<br>
The other Romans grinned and raised their swords in glory.<br>
<br>
The young boy looked at the portal and raised his hands, he then stood and yelled into the gate. &quot;OPEN!&quot;<br>
<br>
Nothing Happened. ..  .<br>
<br>
Sapphira stood and struck the boy. &quot;How can you be so stupid!?&quot; She yelled.<br>
&quot;Try it again!&quot;<br>
<br>
He cringed and then stood raising his arms and yelled into the portal &quot;OPEN!&quot;<br>
<br>
Nothing happened.<br>
<br>
Sapphira glared down at her son.<br>
<br>
&quot;You worthless piece of. . &quot; She mumbled as she took out a dagger and struck the boy in the back. He gasped in pain as the blood dripped down his back. He collapsed to the floor and the blood dripped into the portal.<br>
<br>
A large flame came out from the gate and opened the portal completely.<br>
<br>
Sapphira grinned and smiled to her son. &quot;Come now boy.&quot;<br>
<br>
He was alive, but in deep pain.. . <br>
<br>
Sapphira stepped towards the portal and  turned back.<br>
<br>
&quot;Romans! Today we take our new home, and destroy the amazons!&quot;<br>
<br>
They raised their swords and followed their Leader.<br>
<br>
Back in the real world. .. .  <br>
<br>
A knock was heard at Alysia's door.<br>
<br>
&quot;Enter.&quot; She said softly.<br>
<br>
Wulf ran in holding his right side in pain. &quot;LaTra! I have been wounded.&quot; He fell by her side.<br>
<br>
Aly rushed to her son and removed his shirt to find the wound. &quot;who did this Wulf?&quot;<br>
<br>
He cringed. &quot;I don't know, out of no where it just happened.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked at his back and a wound was there indeed, as if a dagger had been pressed to his skin. &quot;By the Gods. . .&quot; She dressed his wound and looked to him. &quot;It is not mortal wound. You will be fine. Now run throughout the village screaming, telling the amazons that war has broken out and Romans are comming.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wulf looked at her with a quirked brow. &quot;But, it's too early, I haven't finished my training.&quot;<br>
<br>
She yelled &quot;They don't seem to care about that Wulf. Now go!&quot;<br>
<br>
Wulf ran throughout the village calling the amazons. Each of them came to the center of the village wondering what had happened.<br>
<br>
Alysia stood before them all. . . <br>
<br>
&quot;My sisters, we have been called to war. By ourselves.&quot;<br>
<br>
A few of them  mumbled not knowing what to say.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know the stories of Xena and Hercules in another world. An Alternate Universe. Well our &quot;other&quot; selves are all Romans. And they want to come here and fight us. The portal is opened and the war has already begun. I tell you this now, no one fight anyone but your &quot;other&quot; self. If you harm another Roman, one of your sisters will be harmed. If you kill one, you or one of your sisters will die. Remember this, only Wulf can stop the bloodshed, please becareful. Now go and fight for your lives!&quot;<br>
<br>
The amazons immediatly looked to the hill overlooking the village and sure enough a blazing portal was opened and Romans by the numbers were marching out of it. Not just Romans, women. . .women with the skills of amazons.<br>
<br>

She looked down to the village as she heard Wulf crying out to everyone to gather. She disappeared from her perch, reappearing a few feet off from where Alysia stood and listened to the words of her Queen. A frown creased her brow and she did not bother to look to the portal, her blood boiling already from the feeling it induced in her body. Finally, she disappeared once again and reappeared in the trees where the Romans came flooding from the portal. She watched them all, recognizing the faces of many of her athelfi, yet something different about each, knowing these weren't those that she thought of as sisters. She growled lightly and moved farther back into the cover of the trees when she found she could not locate her own face. She turned in time as a figure lung at her from behind. She ducked and the figure landed silently and gracefully on the end of the branch. She glared into a set of blazing silvery-golden eyes, golden hair falling into a familiar face to contrast the tanned skin::<br>
<br>
&quot;I see you've found a way into our world... You are a disgrace to what I am.&quot; ::Sartha narrowed her eyes at the mirror of herself, the figure before her exactly her equal in every way besides the golden hair::<br>
<br>
&quot;You are everything I thought you would be, dear self. But you lack something..&quot; ::the figure sneered and Sartha lowered herself to an attack stance. In unison they spoke:: <br>
&quot;My skills!&quot; ::with that the two lunged at each other, tumbling from the tree to the ground before breaking apart once more. By now, Sartha could see her other Athelfi begin to find their mirrors. She watched silently for a moment, then glanced back to her opponent::<br>
<br>
&quot;Before we both end up injuring each other and ourselves, tell me your name.&quot;<br>
<br>
::The figure nodded::<br>
<br>
&quot;Fair enough I suppose. I am named Sira Marie Terrel.&quot;<br>
<br>
::Sartha chuckled and bowed lightly::<br>
<br>
&quot;I am Sartha Anne Rose.&quot;<br>

Alysia stood on the hill. She was ready to fight. As she looked behind her, a few of the others had already begun to fight, Sartha for one was at a one on one battle with herself. Alysia had a bad feeling. She saw the break of the Romans guard as they all ran into a rumage against the amazons. She wondered where Dawn was. <br>
<br>
Wulf ran up to his mother. &quot;I think I found him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Alysia nodded. &quot;Then do as you will Wulf. And remember, I love you.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled to her son. She then looked up and saw her, a woman dressed in crimson. She wore a small helmet but removed it for Aly to see. <br>
<br>
&quot;Sapphira&quot; Alysia spoke aloud.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alysia&quot; The woman grinned with evil flowing through her veins.<br>
<br>
Alysia walked through the battle to meet Sapphira face to face. <br>
<br>
&quot;Leave now or you're asking for trouble Saphhira.&quot; Alysia said to the Roman Champion.<br>
<br>
&quot;I already asked for it Aly. That's what brought me here, that's what's going to help me win. Remember one thing Alysia, you were once me. That's the difference between us and the others. You know exactly what if feels like to have Elisians blood all over your hands, to smell it with greatness, to have the taste of it on your lips. I am what you could have been. . .A Champion!&quot;<br>
<br>
Alysia cringed at the very thought, but then she looked up. &quot;And I am what you'll never be.&quot; She sheathed her sword and held it outward.<br>
<br>
Sapphira grinned and shook her head. &quot;One thing though amazon . . &quot; She chuckled. &quot;I don't fear pain.&quot; She pulled out a dagger and stabbed herself in the right hand.<br>
<br>
Alysia screamed in pain and dropped her sword that was being held in her right hand. She looked up with hatred in her eyes, but then she thought of Eli and the love he brought into her soul. She couldn't bare to hate this thing standing in front of her, for Sapphira was right, this was who Alysia was and who she could have been. She looked at Sapphira and grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's not the only thing Sapphira, I don't fear death.&quot; She picked up her sword and held it to her own stomach and yelled as though she was going to jab it inwards.<br>
<br>
Sapphira jumped towards her knocking the sword out of her hands. She had done exactly as Alysia had expected. Aly took the oportunity and grabbed Sapphira's dagger out of her hands relieving her of her weapons. Sapphira knew Aly better though and she flipped over her and grabbed Alysia's dropped sword. Alysia looked over Sapphira's shoulder and saw Dawn. Sapphira and Dawn faced one another and Alysia heard Dawn mumble. . &quot;Forgive me Aly.&quot; She saw the hilt raised and before she knew it, both she and Sapphira were on the ground unconscious.<br>

Blonde tendrils fell about her face..covering her red eyes, even though she couldn't see her hand as she brought it up, she felt her own crimson blood on her hands.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Damn&quot;<br>
<br>
 Using the bloody hand she pushed back the hair, running the blood over her mask, as she looked toward Sapphira, who now was standing, too. Both warriors were groggy...from their time unconcious. <br>
<br>
 But Dawn knew one thing, she had to get her into the middle of town, at least then she could keep a good eye on Wulf..Aly..and herself. Turning, she grabbed her swords, and flipped, landing in the middle of the fighting she took off running through everyone. Missing a few cuts and bruises, but Sapphira was close behind her. <br>
<br>
 Hoping to not be side tracked it ended up wrong, she felt the dagger slice into her shin, but she kept running, yanking the dagger out and shoving it deep into the shoulder of the one who threw it. Twas all the damage she could do, although she did hesitate in putting the dagger through the heart.<br>
<br>
 As she now ran...limp..jogged..in that pattern, she approached the center of town. She wasn't the only battler there, Wulf was there, too. <br>
<br>
 Smiling to him, as if a wish of luck, she turned to meet Sapphira head on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Roman Dawnithinia</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(2/7/01 8:50:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=73.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Welcome to War Dear Alysia....</span><hr size=1>  The angered Dawn, dressed clad in Roman leathers, had drew her sword, emerging from the warriors with fierce red eyes.

They raised their daggers in unison and Sartha's dagger began to glow black while Sira's began to glow white. Runic lettering shown brightly on the identical blades and the women could only continue to grin at each other::<br>
<br>
&quot;Your secret is my secret, dear mirror.&quot; ::Sira sneered, but Sartha only continued to grin::<br>
<br>
&quot;Is it really? I don't quite think so, Sira. You see... there's something I know that you never could in your dimension... Something I had that you never could have. You see, dear mirror, I know your story, but you don't know mine like you think you do. I had the honor of seeing a glimpse of life in another world, another story. I saw you... And I know what you've lost... and gained.&quot; ::Sartha continues to grin more maliciously with each word as the sneer slowly dropped away from Sira's face::<br>

<br>
She growled and flipped up. She didn't want to fight knowing the effect it would have on Dawn. Alysia then turned her eyes towards her son as he came out of the weapon hut holding his own sword in hand. She had a bad feeling that Wulf was what Sapphira wanted. And she was not going to let that happen. <br>
<br>
Knowing that Romans only train with their hands on bare weapons, she knew that without her hands, Sapphira would be incapable of fighting. Alysia drew a dagger and struck it straight through her palm. She screamed in agony. But it was not enough, Alysia took her bloodly hand and held the dagger as firm as she could, but it was no use. She had hurt herself so badly that she couldn't even pick up the hilt. Alysia then dropped the blade and cringed while ripping a piece of cloth from her skirt she wrapped the wound.<br>
<br>
&quot;It would have been a good idea. Perhaps it'll hold her off a bit longer.&quot;<br>
<br>
She mumbled to herself as she began to run through the village, the Roman Dawn right behind her. Alysia then reached her good hand up and caught the branch of a tree swinging herself upwards and perching herself on the branch. When Dawn came by looking for her, Alysia swung down kicking her in the back knocking her to the ground. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Sapphira Roman Queen</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(2/8/01 10:39:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=73.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Dawn. . . </span><hr size=1> Sapphira grinned at Dawn.<br>

&quot;This is a fight I have been waiting for.&quot;<br>
<br>
She knew Dawn couldn't resist the crave for her blood, Sapphira knew that same craving as she drew her sword and ran at Dawn head on. The battle was good and it seemed to last a while. <br>
<br>
Sapphira glanced over at Alysia battling the other Dawn and for a moment she thought she was standing in from of a mirror. &quot;Damn amazons!&quot;<br>
<br>
Dawn heard this and the battle became more vicious.<br>
Sapphira had to take a few steps back to catch her ground before attacking Dawn head on once again. They had their swords bareing against eachother when Sapphira leaned down and looked at Dawn...<br>
<br>
&quot;You know the difference between myself, Alysia and the others? I'm not Alysia's alternate self. I'm the evil within her. I am what she used to be, the evil still within her, and no matter what I can't die.&quot;<br>
<br>
She cackled loudly but then screamed in total pain as her sword fell to the ground and her right had began to bleed. She lost her ground and fell on her back holding her hand tightly she screamed aloud.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll get you for this Alysia!&quot;<br>

&quot;For every cut comes twice the blood. This isn't a war, it's a slaughter house.&quot;<br>

He knew this must be stopped. He knew what he had to do. But then it all went blank when he saw two Dawn's and two of his mother's fighting one on one.

&quot;Damn the amazons. . &quot; He mumbled thinking that if it wasn't their fault, then the Romans wouldn't even be here. Typical roman brat. Blaming all others before taking on any for himself.<br>

He looked and saw the Amazon Prince searching for him. <br>

&quot;I need to hold him off as long as I can.&quot;<br>
