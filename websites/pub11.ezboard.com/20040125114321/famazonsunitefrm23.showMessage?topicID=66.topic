She was Zeus's favorite but today she felt a bit rebellious. She decided that was not apporpriate for her so she looked upon the new child and smiled to Hera quickly. <br>
<br>
&quot;So you've made her you second in command in the realm of childbirth? I'd blame Aphrodite for that one but she has her job and I have mine speaking of which one of my jobs await me.&quot; <br>
