He looked down to the blade, which rested upon the floor beside him.  Corpus could only stare at it, wondering why he even kept it.  His personal mission was done.  He defeated Juride, even though he spared the being’s life, but something inside insisted.  He bent down to one knee and gripped the handle firmly.  He watched his reflection within the blade, and what he saw he despised.  Ever since the incident with the ball of light, which stopped him from delivering the final blow to Juride, he was unable to return to his saurian form.  He was trapped in a man’s body.  He sighed heavily, and sheathed the blade.<br><br>There was still so much bitterness.  His heart, still twisted, and his mind, still numb, from the pain of memories that haunted him.

There had been rumors of troubles up north, and news of great dismay.
