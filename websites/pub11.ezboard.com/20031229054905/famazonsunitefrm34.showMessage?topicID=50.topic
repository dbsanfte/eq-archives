Although for many years the legend of the Amazons was believed to be little more than a myth, recent research shows there were actually two Amazon' nations. These nations preceded the Greek and Roman Empires by centuries. The first empire, known as the Gorgon or Hesperian Amazons, was composed of Lybian women warriors. Their greatest queen, Myrene, conquered and held parts of Syria, Egypt, Phygia and several Mediterranean islands, including the island of Lesbos.(Lesvos) She was said to have lead an army of over 30,000 women on horseback. After she died the Amazons deserted their colonies and returned to Libia. Several centuries later a second Amazon nation, the Therodontine Amazon Nation, established itself. It re-conquered much of the same areas held by the first. This matriarchy was a Bronze Age nation of allied city-states near the Sea of Azov and controlled lands from the Russian steppes through the Tauric Mountains. This nation has been dated from the fifth to the third century BC. <br>
<br>
There are several ancient Greek and Roman women warriors of note. There was Amastris-who established her own city-state and Artemisia- advisor to Xerxes, ruler of Persia - who lead a fleet of battleships against Greece around 480 BC. Telessilla, a 5&quot;' century warrior-poet, lead the women of Argos in the defense of their city. Two princesses of Sparta, Arachidamia and Cheidonis, lead large female armies in Sparta. <br>
<br>
There were also many women warriors throughout the Middle East, China, Afiica, Asia, Egypt and the Celtic lands. Some of the more famous were Zebibi and Samsi of Arabia, Septima Zenobia of Syria, and Mavia of the Bedouin Saracens. Kahula and Waferira of Arabia turned back the Greek army. Candace Amanirenas of Egypt defeated Patronious of the Roman legion. Fu Hao and Hau Mu-Lan were revered leaders and warriors of China. The sisters Trung Trae and Trung Nhi lead a revolt that forced the Chinese occupation out of Vietnam. Kogo Jingo of Japan personally lead her navy to assure that there would be no raping and plundering of conquered areas. Also of great importance to the ancient world were the Celtic warrior queens Castimandua, Aife of Alba, Mebd of Ireland, Scathach of Skye, and Boudicca of the Iceni of Norfolk. <br>
<br>
If Xena had been a real person, she would have had these women as contemporaries. They may have never been comrades in arms, but at least Xena would have not been the only Warrior Princess. <br>

Myrine (Myrina, Myrene). A Queen, from whom the city of Myrine/Myrina on the west coast of Asia Minor may be named. She subdued the island of Lesbos, and built its chief city, Mytilene, named after her sister who'd assisted her in the campaign.<br>
<br>
Myrine was the Queen of the Libyan Amazons based in Northern Africa, which predate the Themiskyran Amazons (by how long is unknown). These coastal Amazons, then, were the first, or first-known, of their kind. Their lands were an island called Hespera, which was situated in a marsh named Tritonis; nearby, the Triton River emptied into what would someday be called the Atlantic Ocean. Mount Atlas overlooked their queendom. They were prosperous and well-respected, under their Queen Myrina (Myrine), and conquered the entire island to make it theirs. Their presence was fearful, adorned in complete battle gear: helmets, breastplates, and spears, all covered in snakeskin. These are the Amazons which are said to have invaded the legendary Atlantis, which received fair treatment at the hands of Myrine in exchange for the foundation of a new city to be named after her. With an alliance of sorts, the Amazons attacked their bitter enemies the Gorgons, not to be confused with (but certainly not discounted as) the three sisters of Persean mythology.<br>
<br>
The 3,000 Gorgons were not captive for long. The Amazons suffered tremendously during the nighttime escape. In mourning, Myrine had burial hills built to honor the dead. Now on the move, Myrine conquered Libya from coast to coast, then won against Arabia, Syria, Tauria (near the Black Sea), and all the lesser tribes on their way to the area they finally stopped in. The mighty Caicus River became their land boundary, and cities were founded in the names of fallen comrades.<br>
<br>
In the campaign against Lesbos, a great storm assailed the island and Myrine and many of her people were washed away to an uninhabited island that she named Samothrace, which lay off the coast of Thrace. Unfortunately, pirates got the upper hand on the weary Amazons, and those that survived that ordeal made the long trek back to Libya.<br>
<br>
These are the same Amazons said to have accosted the drunken wine god Dionysus while on his way back to Greece from his campaigns in India. Although once asked to fight on the side of the gods by Dionysus, this time there was no such alliance. It is unknown which Amazon tribe fought Dionysus, however, or if both did. They suffered a massive defeat after a hard-fought war with the god and his followers, and many finally retreated into the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus (one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World). Many were slaughtered there, and others were chased onto the island of Samos off the coast, where they were killed. The battlefield, for its bloodiness, was thereafter known as Panhaema.<br>
<br>
Some survivors of the Dionysan war became priestesses of Artemis at the temple; others returned to Libya where they were later wiped from existence by the labor-eager Hercules, who had come to the outer realms of Libya to set up his famous pillars. On their march home, they buried Myrine at Troy and the Greeks later declared her an ancestor to the Trojans. <br>
<br>
Descriptions of a battle waged by the Libyan Amazons in their home territory, in which 30,000 soldiers and 3,000 cavalry fought, is believed to be the earliest record in the world of troops riding horses into battle. Traditionally then and now, these Amazons of Libya are believed to be the first to capture and tame horses for military purpose. <br>
