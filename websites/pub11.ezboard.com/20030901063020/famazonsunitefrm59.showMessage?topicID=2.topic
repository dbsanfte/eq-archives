She glanced around, moving her head with her jade-green orbs.  Her long and curly red locks moved with her head.  A loud womanly screech came from the ship and so did a flying leather bag.  Amarice threw her hand up in the air with an aggitated gesture.  &quot;What?  You want a piece?&quot; she said with no fear in her voice.  The old woman on the ship returned with another rude hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Psh&quot; and the woman quickly disappeared on the ship.  The ship did not leave as Amarice carried her bag off into the island.  Someone else was on that ship, and she was taking a while to get off.<br>

<br>
&quot;Amarice, have you lost your reason? You were tught respect I am sure of that! You keep on acting this way then others will follow and the Amazons will become a joke told by old fat men in Taverns. You are nto a child, Your an Amazon!&quot;<br>

After the little speech, Yakut stalked off ahead of Amarice. It was as if everything went in one ear and quickly moved out the other with the young warrior.<br>

<br>

After Yakut had given her directions to find a place to put her yurt, she began to slowly began to walk up shore.  She stood where the grass met the sand.  The young Amazon looked down for a bit then moved her jade-green orbs to Yakut.  &quot;I would love to set up my yurt here.  It's just perfect...soft land and grass, and oh-so close to the shore...Ah, and you should have your own hut for when you come to visit me right....over....&quot; She brings up her right hand and points in that direction, &quot;There...You ok with that?&quot;<br>
<br>
With her green pools still fixed on Yakut, Amarice began her way back over to her.  &quot;What do we need to do now to prepare for the cleansing ritual?&quot;  She was anxious to preform it, for she loved being in rituals.  The adrinaline was strong during them, but not as strong as in battle. <p>Ø×××|¯A_m¯a_r¯i_c¯e_&gt;</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000080><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=amazonqueenyakut>Amazon Queen Yakut </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Queen of Tanis River Valley</span><br>  Posts: 240<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/15/02 1:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm59.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.hometown.aol.com/amznqyakut1/images/yakut3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> kk</span><hr size=1> Yakut smiled and nodded agreeing to Amarice's fancy. She pointed to the water that would crawl up the shore blanketing the sand only for a moment before slithering back to its domain.<br>
<br>
&quot;You must be purified in the waters that surround your Island, for they bring your island nutrition... you and the Island must stand as one, every little shift in the ground your body must sense it.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Shamaness set down her brown leather bag and picked up a handful of dirt and sand. She approached Amarice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Take off your headdress (hat thingy she wears), and remove all jewelry and weapons.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yakut waited til Amarice had done as told, she then beganing massaging the soil in her hands onto Amarice's arms. She gathered up some sea water and mixed it with the dirt to make a mud substance. She contiued spreading the earth over Amarice's arms, legs and neck.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are now wrapped in Gaia, move with me to the water so that the sea can meet the Island and its new Queen...&quot;<br>
<br>
She took the young warrior by her wrist and lead her into the water, she stopped about waist deep. Yakut then washed her hands and cupped them. The Shamaness brought up water from the sea and poured it over Amarice, cleansing the dirt from her body.<br>
<br>
&quot;A queen is a chalice...let me fill you with visions from our history, fragments from a time before we were Amazons, when cannibals slaughtered our men and warriors like the great Samsara called on the shaman for a savior from the future - an atmah - the first Cyane.&quot; <br>
<br>
Yakut raised her palms to the sky, closed her eyes and pulled forth the memory of Samsara, she pushed the vision into Amarice's mind's eye.<br>
<br>
&quot;Behold the Legendary Samsara...&quot;<br>
<br>
Amarice sees a flash of Samsara holding the Atmah dagger...Samsara bringing forth the Atmah, Cyane...a girl from the 20th century, she sees Cyane mount a horse that were usually eaten by the Tretmolecs...<br>
<br>
&quot;Her strange ways and clothes confused the tribe, but her courage was real...&quot;<br>
<br>
Amarice is sent more flashes of the Atmah and Samsara..<br>
<br>
 &quot;Tonight your coronation continues a ritual passed down to us through the ages - a ritual of music and movement, a celebration of community and joy, for we are a family united in sisterhood.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yakut brought forth a chalice and filled it with ceremonial Tanais River Valley wyne, she whispered Ancient words of prayer over it before continuing on..<br>
<br>
&quot;We are the creators and our own creations - the words and the music - both singer and song. Our traditions stretch back to the great Gaia herself, mother of us all. A tradition of dance … of music … of sacrifice … of blood.&quot;<br>
<br>
Blood was no longer used it rituals, except for Scynthian Amazons...Yakut handed the chalice to Amarice...<br>
<br>
&quot;Embrace the Amazon way … as our foresisters honored the first Cyane, give your spirit kiss to our new Queen, Amarice.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yakut leans foreward placing a kiss on Amarice's forehead.<br>
<br>
&quot;Drink the wyne as a symbol of your loyalty and obligation to your sisters, to your tribe, and the Fallen Ones before us...&quot;<br>
<br>
Once Amarice had drunk the wyne, Yakut dipped her hand in the sea and annointed Amarice with the blue liquid.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail to the new Queen!&quot;<br>
<br>
The Shamaness saluted Amarice and announced, &quot;Welcome, Amarice, Queen of Samos!&quot;<br>

She listened with determination, her jade-green orbs staying fixed upon the Shamaness.<br>
<br>
When Yakut asked her to remove her headdress, she slid the elven-like cap off, revealing her head full of darken red tresses which curled down her back.  Then she began to remove all jewelry (which wasn't much) and her sword, placing each item gently in the sand infront of her feet.<br>
<br>
When Yakut began to rub Gaia on her she moved with the shamaness allowing her to spread the mud on her.  She followed Yakut to into the sea and allowed her to wash the mud off of her body.<br>
<br>
Amarice accepted all the images of the Amazon's history and past as Yakut sent them to her mind.  Closely following Yakut's every word.<br>
<br>
When Yakut leaned forward to give her the spirit kiss on her forehead she slowly closed her eyes as a tiny smile fell upon her lips.  When Yakut asked her to drink the wyne, Amarice accepted and brought the chalice to her lips, swallowing the tasteful liquid.<br>
<br>
Once she was hailed and saluted, Amarice returned the salute.  And once Yakut also began the celebration cry, Amarice joined her with one of her own. <p>Ø×××|¯A_m¯a_r¯i_c¯e_&gt;</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000080><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=amazonqueenyakut>Amazon Queen Yakut </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Queen of Tanis River Valley</span><br>  Posts: 241<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/25/02 8:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm59.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.hometown.aol.com/amznqyakut1/images/yakut3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Woo!</span><hr size=1> Yakut smiled, taking a stepp back from Amarice.<br>

Yakut walked past Amarice and began unrolling her bedroll, leaving Amarice to a few moments of quiet comtemplation. There was more to being Queen than powering over land and a tribe...Amarice had to realiz this on her own.<br>
<br>
After she had set up her bedroll, she decided a fire was needed. Her emerald occulars landed on Amarice.<br>

As she was standing there her mind left her body, drowning in a sea of thoughts and ideas.  She was soon going to be Queen, and she was just realizing the difficulties, responsapilities, and joys that were in store for her.  But she challenged them as she would a opponent in a battle.<br>
<br>
When Yakut asked for her to find some wood for their fire place Amarice snapped back into reality and turned her head towards the Shamaness.  &quot;I'll go get some wood sense your back goes out more than you do!&quot;  and with that Amarice headed up shore and to the forest with a smirk playing her lips.<br>
<br>
About 15 minutes later Amarice returns with a stack of perfect sized logs.  She craidles them with her arms and below her waist, balancing the top with her chin.  She drops the stack next to her bedroll.  &quot;Here, is this enough for tonight...or do I need to get more?&quot; The young amazon begins unrolling her bedroll diagnal from Yakuts.  And once she was done she sat down on her bedroll, waiting for Yakut to start the fire.  &quot;I fetched the logs, you can start the fire...&quot; <p>Ø×××|¯A_m¯a_r¯i_c¯e_&gt;</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000080><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=amazonqueenyakut>Amazon Queen Yakut </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Queen of Tanis River Valley</span><br>  Posts: 242<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/1/02 11:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm59.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.hometown.aol.com/amznqyakut1/images/yakut3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Fire?, I'll give you fire!</span><hr size=1> Yakut mymbled a few words under her breath, and waited til Amarice came back with the wood. Once she had returned, Yakut stacked the wood neatly. She clasped her hands together and pressed them against her forehead, words of wisdom and power slithered from her lips. Quickly her hand moved down and fanned out over the wood stack, the wood went up in a nice flame. Yakut stood back admiring her work, she quirked a brow at Amarice as a small smirk captured her features.<br>
<br>
The Shamaness moved to her saddle bag and took out her cantine, she sucked a gulp into her mouth and sprayed the fire, flames crawled to Amarice encircling her but never touching her. They slithered back into the fire, nd Yakut took a seat across from Amarice.<br>

And she just shrugged the magick trick away with a smirk playing her lips and her twisted red locks falling to her back.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sure anyone, including I could've done that!&quot;<br>
<br>
Just as Yakut caused the fire the circle around Amarice and her bedroll, she began to gently grasp at the hilt of her sword.  Then she thought to herself, 'What the hell could I do with my sword to a flame?  Fan it away?'  then she quickly let it go before Yakut noticed so she couldn't make fun of her.  Everytime Amarice figured she was being threatened she would grab hold of her sword.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ohhh, that was as stupid as a card trick.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Of course Amarice was lying, the flame truely did slightly scare her.  But she would never admit if something upsetted her, even if someone was threatning her emotionally.  She did not want anyone seeing her weaknesses. <p>Ø×××|¯A_m¯a_r¯i_c¯e_&gt;</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000080><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=amazonqueenyakut>Amazon Queen Yakut </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Queen of Tanis River Valley</span><br>  Posts: 243<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/1/02 11:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm59.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.hometown.aol.com/amznqyakut1/images/yakut3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I can read ya like a book child</span><hr size=1> Yakut smirked and shook her head.

&quot;You can't fool someone who practices the Craft of the Wise. My magick is anything but a card trick, child. I know things even the wisest of Kings and Queens would shudder at...It's the price you pay as a Shaman of the Olden Ways.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yakut laid down on her bedroll and starred up into the sky..it was getting dark out. Star began peeking from the blanketing sky.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh child, many things will come to you, but patience is a virtue. Never seek, just find. Be found. When you are one with something, you do not control, you listen with your mind.&quot;<br>

She thrust her arm out spraying the sand all over Amarice. The Shamaness laughed, she was playing of course.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll fix you some food, but only because your Queen here...&quot;<br>
<br>
Yakut got up and began looking through her saddle bags for food. She took out a bottle of red wyne, bread, a small container of pasta and some olive oil. She had gotten in her shipment from a place called Florence in the Roman empire. They made food to die for!<br>
<br>
The Shamaness quietly warmed up the pasta and served all the food up on two plates. She handed Amarice hers and some utensils before digging into her own plate. After swallowing her first bite she looked up at Amarice.<br>
<br>
