And now she slowely rode towards the neutral grounds that seperated the known amazon lands from the outsiders.  Dressed in her old war leathers, she wore the mask of war over her head and face.  She looked more like a wild bird woman upon that large grey mare then anything else.  Her armour was heavily decorated with emblems of Hera and wild horses stampeding.  Across her waist, she wore the belt given to her by her father, Ares.  Unlike many of the amazons who were making their marks now adays.  Hippolyte was one of the southern amazons.  Tribes that were brought up under the beliefs of the Olympian Gods.  Daughters of Ares these women were called.  And some of them, like Hippolyte, were the war gods children by actual birth.  Under her mask, her face was stern.  The edge of the amazon lands was being threatened.  And she would not allow it.<br>
As she rode along, she chanted in an almost hiss to her goddess, Hera.  Her brown eyes were set and hard as she gazed thru her mask.  Her small but strong hands held the reigns in one hand and in the other a long slim scimitar that rested next to one of her thighs.   Her heart beating in the rythem of the chant, Hippolyte was ready and firm in her convictions. <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

For the last couple of months, the immortal amazon assassin had been playing things safe, staying out of the cross fire, and staying out of the fights. But one thing be known, you can't keep a good woman [or man] down, and welp, that blood lust was going to proove it in this war. <br>
<br>
 Dawnithinia Rivent Darkshade, had made one pitstop after leaving Orio-Pata; for this war. Where do you think she went? Ares could tell you, or more aless, that's where she went. The favored assassin, against the gods.. why not stop at a temple for worship.<br>
<br>
 But now, behind the other Queens, and Princesses, the Queen of the assassins; The Queen of Orio-Pata, made her appearence.<br>
<br>
 Tight black leathers, doned her body. They were old, and still smelt of the days when war was a common thing, and blood shed brought about the multiple massacres. Leather elven boots, were as always, sheathed with four black hilted daggers. Travelling up the assassin's legs, on each outter thigh, was a leather sheath, holding, you guessed it, two black hilted knives. The sword.. was placed securely across her back. Not a weapon had a shimmering glow to it, not a one. The security of camoflouge was needed, this was just to proove it.<br>
<br>
 The amazon queen, rode comfortably on a black stallion. The Orio-Pata symbol blazed into the skin on its right hind quarter. A war markings similar to the one that covered the rider's face [Half Tiger, Half Wolf, for those who want details.], adorned the saddle, the reigns, and the bridle.<br>
<br>
 Blazing crimson eyes, shifted to Alysia, as she pulled the horse to a stop along side her friend, and athelfi. It was not by choice that she was here, but by force. This was the amazon nation, and she was apart of it. When she'd entered her life into it, she had vowed life and soul to it. No fear of death would stop her from prooving her greatest devotion.<br>
<br>
 A deep breath, and then a content, focused sigh escaped from under the mask. There wasn't a moment, when Dawn herself didn't think of Wulf, Lilla, or the things she'd just left behind. She'd come back alive, no immortal could die unless they wanted, too. With the right mind, Dawn wasn't about to die because she got into some war, with some overly egotistical gods, oh and goddesses.<br>
<br>
 It was time to play dirty, and everyone knows, Dawn can get down and dirty with the best of them; if she isn't one of the best.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
[Side Bar: This is the only time I'm stating it. I do have all control over my character. None of you have the consent to kill her. Dawn is IMMORTAL. She is a SHAPESHIFTER respect the forms she takes on. She CAN HEAL, but does loose energy in the process. DO NOT RP my character for me. . if you do I WILL IGNORE THE ENTIRE POST. In no way am I really wanting to RP this, but I will, becuase of who my character is. If you don't like these conditions, don't fight my character. PS. Don't attack her unless she's made a MOVE TO YOU. I refuse to have Dawn attacked by moding gods [And if I consider you moder in the way you RP, dont' expect me to honor your match.] or multiple gods at once. I do hold the rights to this character, and I do have alot of requests to fight her. But.. I do have control of her, and that's what you get, and that's how she's stayed alive for so long.] <p>

Her staff was in one hand, the reins of her horse in the other, and she had daggers and sais tucked into both boots and two more daggers tucked under her belt.<br>

She wore black leather pants and vest, and a black peaked headband, given to her by the Queen of her former tribe.<br>

Varia nodded to the Amazons she knew- Hippolyte, DeL, Dawn and Alysia.
