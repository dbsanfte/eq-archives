She requests to see Xena but he has something else in mind. Ares instructs his high priest Medos to watch careful over the Summerian soul stone. That same night a vision of Xena encourages Eve to take up her warrior ways once more. Eve looks uncertain if she should leave Eli's teachings. The next day Ares speaks privately with Gabrielle. He expresses regret for the pain he caused her with Eli's death. He passes his hand in front of her and gives her goddess powers once more. He allows her a free day to use her powers without his influence. A nearby village is attacked by a warlord's army. Gabrielle easily defeats them. That night Medos is hit on the head and falls asleep. Eve dressed in Roman battle clothing sneaks into the soul stone room but she is stopped by Gabrielle's new powers. Eve warns her of Ares manipulations. Gabrielle asks Eve to trust her for now. She will know when to stop using her new powers. In the throne room of his temple, Ares listens to their conversation.

Wild Horses<br>
Season 8, Episode 4<br>
After traveling for several weeks, saddened by the loss of Eve, Gabrielle rests in a valley full of wild horses. To her surprise one of the palomino approaches her and then runs to join the others. Gabrielle realizes this is where Amazons first learned to ride horses, the ancient tribal lands of the legendary Atma. She decides to stay for several days and relax. The horses are curious of their new friend and sometimes they approach her. One night around the campfire she senses someone. The spirit of the legendary Amazon warrior Samsarra visits Gabrielle and comforts her on her loss. She hints that Gabrielle can make amends but at a cost. Gabrielle wakes up the next morning to see several horses watched over standing around her as she slept. The palomino approaches her and Gabrielle senses somehow this is the valley where Xena first met Argo. Samsarra visits Gabrielle the next night and asks of her gifts. Gabrielle says she would give up her godly powers if it would bring Eve back. Samsarra says that it would be a very big sacrifice to loose such strength. Gabrielle would still make the trade. Samsarra nods her head in approval as Gabrielle sleeps. The palomino leads Gabrielle to a secret cave the next day where an enchanted scroll tells her how to call upon an Amazon spirit. Gabrielle builds a campfire at night. Samsarra and Eve appear and let her know all is well. Gabrielle's powers are taken from her to ensure Eve's safe passage into the Elysian Fields.<br>

Surprisingly Amazon women travel openly within the village. It becomes quickly apparent that the tribe allows men. Varia disapproves of the new ways and sees it as a weakening of the Amazon heritage. Gabrielle agrees but admits with recent battle losses with the Romans and Bellerophon, new ways may be necessary. Talks continue for several days with the Monciea tribal council. Each night Varia camps out among the stars, refusing a village room to inspire the new tribe. Varia believes they should see how a true Amazon warrior lives with nature. After a week has past, talks conclude with promising trade agreements. Varia and Gabrielle leave the new tribe on good terms. They return to a celebration in their honor.
