If you could, would you rather have Aphrodite or Hectate instead of me? <br>
<br>
I mean,  if Aprodite was more innocent. Because I overheard a couple of gods conversing, and they mentioned that every god wanted aphrodite for his own and...::looks fine but sounds as if she's about to cry:: and well, I know I don't even compare at all to Aphrodite's looks and character...<br>
<br>
And Hectate seemed like she would be someone you'd prefere because, well as she says, your &quot;morbid&quot; which is something I won't even try to understand. B-but she's hateful and dark and seems more fitted for this place than me... And I have done a lot of complaining since I was bounded here and all.... <br>
<br>
::closes her eyes, sighs and looks at him:: There, I got it off my chest...<br>
