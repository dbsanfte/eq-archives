The amazon's seem more powerful than he imagined but he will not let them deter him. He still feels that the amazons and their allies will be crippled no matter their strength. He looks to Fogstone and at his army and the chatter and suspense makes his blood run with excitement. He slams his trident into the ground and the earth shakes minutely. The trees sway and the sediments and things on the ground clatter and jumble slightly. A slight crack as if a boulder were tossed from a high cleft and fell on other rocks below is made.::<br>

She then looks back to Varia. &quot;You know,I am getting a bit anxious.

She grasps the spear in her right hand then walks to the front of the line. She takes a glance around at the others and seeing noone is prepared to give the attack signal,she takes it upon her self to get the party started.<br>
<br>
She raises the spear up. &quot; Lets do this!!!!&quot; She yells,then brings the spear back,her eyes fixing on Hypnos,just cause he looked at her the wrong way,she thrusts her arm forward,releasing the spear at a precise moment. The spear shoots through the air giving off an awful whistling sound as it flies across the field and heads directly at Hypnos,but as Zelia had planned,the spear comes short and stabs into the ground just infront of Hypnos,the spear having a motion that causes it to snap back and forth and as it snaps forward the shaft of the spear (Is Suppose to,if you take the hit,Hypnos!) wacks Hypnos in the nose.<br>
