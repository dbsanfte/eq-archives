Resides in the underworld, Tartarus. Hecate (hekate) was knowen as being the goddess of sorcery &amp; silverfooted queen of the night. Skilled in the divine arts of foretelling the future she gives humans dreams and visions which interpeted wisely led to greater clarity.<br>
She wore a shimmering headdress she was...<br>

Crowns herself with oak leaves and twisting coils of wild serpents her charriot pulled by dragons. Her image stands at crossroads where offerings of dogs, honey &amp; black lambs are left on full moon night.<br>

She is connected with death &amp; regeneration. Her presence in the underworld allows for pre-Hellenic hope of re-birth and transformation as oppose to Hades who represents the inevitability of death.<br>
<br>
Hecate (Hekate) did not interfere when the maiden Persephone was dragged down to the underworld though she was one of the few who heard her screams <br>

The goddess of witchcraft, Hekate was the only child of the Titanes Perses and Asteria. From her parents she inherited powers over the earth, sea and heavens.<br>
Hekate assisted Demeter in her search for Persephone and after their reunion became Persephone's minister and companion in Hades. She was closely associated with Eleusinian Mysteries.<br>
<br>
&quot;Asteria of happy name, whom Perses once led to his great house to be called his dear wife. And she conceived and bare Hekate whom Zeus the son of Kronos honoured above all.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  He gave her splendid gifts, to have a share of the earth and the unfruitful sea. She received honour also in starry heaven, and is honoured exceedingly by the deathless gods. For to this day, whenever any one of men on earth offers rich sacrifices and prays for favour according to custom, he calls upon Hekate. Great honour comes full easily to him whose prayers the goddess receives favourably, and she bestows wealth upon him; for the power surely is with her. For as many as were born of Gaia (Earth) and Ouranos (Heaven) amongst all these she has her due portion. The son of Kronos did her no wrong nor took anything away of all that was her portion among the former Titan gods: but she holds, as the division was at the first from the beginning, privilege both in earth, and in heaven, and in sea. Also, because she is an only child, the goddess receives not less honour, but much more still, for Zeus honours her. Whom she will she greatly aids and advances: she sits by worshipful kings in judgement, and in the assembly whom she will is distinguished among the people. And when men arm themselves for the battle that destroys men, then the goddess is at hand to give victory and grant glory readily to whom she will. Good is she also when men contend at the games, for there too the goddess is with them and profits them: and he who by might and strength gets the victory wins the rich prize easily with joy, and brings glory to his parents.And she is good to stand by horsemen, whom she will: and to those whose business is in the grey discomfortable sea, and who pray to Hekate and the loud-crashing Earth-Shaker [Poseidon], easily the glorious goddess gives great catch, and easily she takes it away as soon as seen, if so she will. She is good in the byre with Hermes to increase the stock. The droves of kine and wide herds of goats and flocks of fleecy sheep, if she will, she increases from a few, or makes many to be less. So, then. albeit her mother's only child, she is honoured amongst all the deathless gods. And the son of Kronos made her a nurse of the young who after that day saw with their eyes the light of all-seeing Dawn. So from the beginning she is a nurse of the young, and these are her honours.&quot; -Theogony 404-452<br>

”Of the gods, the Aiginetans worship most Hekate, in whose honour every year they celebrate mystic rites which, they say, Orpheus the Thrakian established among them.

&quot;You see, the oracles are coming true;  I have heard it foretold, that one day the Athenians would dispense justice in their own houses, that each citizen would have himself a little tribunal constructed in his porch similar to the altars of Hecate (Hekataion), and that there would be such before every door [Hekataion were statues or chapels of Hekate, placed at the entrance of houses or where three roads met].&quot; -Aristophanes Wasps 804<br>

“The Sibyl first lined up four black-skinned bullocks, poured a libation wine upon their foreheads, and then, plucking the topmost hairs from between their brows, she placed these on the altar fires as an initial offering, calling aloud upon Hecate, powerful in heaven and hell. While other laid their knives to these victim’s throats, and caught the fresh warm blood in bowls, Aeneas sacrifices a black-fleeced lamb to Nox (Night), the mother of the Furiae, and her great sister, Terra (earth), and a barren heifer to Proserpine. Then he [Aeneas] set up altars by night to the god of the Underworld [Hades], laying upon the flames whole carcases of bulls and pouring out rich oil over the burning entrails. But listen! – at the very first crack of dawn, the ground underfoot began to mutter, the woody ridges to quake, and a baying of hounds was heard through the half-light: the goddess was coming, Hecate. [a path then opened up for the Sibyl &amp; Aeneas to travel down to Hades].” –Aeneid 6.257<br>

Bitter will I make their marriage, bitter Kreon's marriage-alliance, and bitter my banishment from the land!&quot; -Euripides Medea 396<br>
<br>
“The goddess Hera kept her [Medea] in the house, though as a rule she did not spend her time at home, but was busy all day in the temple of Hekate, of whom she was priestess.” –Argonautica 3.250f<br>
<br>
“[Medea prays to Hekate]: And yet I wish he [Iason] had been spared. Yes Sovran Lady Hekate, this is my prayer. Let him live to reach his home.” –Argonautica 3.466<br>
<br>
 “[Argos to Jason:}’You have heard me speak of a young woman [Medea] who practices witchcraft under the tutelage of the goddess Hekate. If we could win her over, we might banish from our minds all fear of your defeat in the ordeal [yoking the fire breathing bulls of Aeetes].” –Argonautica 3.478f<br>
“[Argos to the Argonauts:]’There is a girl [Medea] living in Aeetes’ palace whom the goddess Hekate has taught to handle with extraordinary skill all the magic herbs that grow on dry land or in running water. With these she can put out a raging fire, she can stop rivers as they roar in spate, arrest a star, and check the movement of the sacred moon.” –Argonautica 3.529<br>
 “[Medea to her aunt Khalkiope:] ‘At dawn I will go to Hekate’s temple with magic medicine for the bulls [to protect Iason from their fiery breath].” –Argonautica 3.735f<br>
<br>
“She [Medea] wished to drive to the splendid Temple of Hekate; and while they [her handmaidens] were getting the carriage ready she took a magic ointment from her box. This salve was named after Prometheus. A man had only to smear it on his body , after propitiating the only-begotten Maiden [Hekate] with a midnight offering, to become invulnerable by sword or fire and for that day to surpass himself in strength and daring. It first appeared in a plant that sprang from the blood-like ichor of Prometheus in his torment, which the flesh-eating eagle had dropped on the spurs of Kaukasos … To make the ointment, Medea, clothed in black, in the gloom of night, had drawn off this juice in a Caspian shell after bathing in seven perennial streams and calling seven times on Brimo [Hekate], nurse of youth, Brimo, night-wanderer of the underworld, Queen of the dead. The dark earth shook and rumbled underneath the Titan root when it was cut, and Prometheus himself groaned in the anguish of his soul.” –Argonautica 3.803f<br>
<br>
“[Medea to Iason:] Medea forced herself to speak to him. ‘Hear me now,’ she said. ‘These are my plans for you. When you have met my father and has given you the deadly teeth from the serpent’s jaws, wait for the moment of midnight and after bathing in an ever-running river, go out alone in sombre clothes and dig a round pit in the earth. There, kill a ewe and after heaping up a pure over the pit, sacrifice ti whole, with a libation of honey from the hive and prayers to Hekate, Perses’ only Daughter. Then, when you have invoked the goddess duly, withdraw from the pyre. And to not be tempted to look behind you as you go, either by footfalls or the baying of hounds, or you may ruin everything and never reach your friends alive. In the morning, melt this charm, strip, and using it like oil, anoint your body. It will endow you with tremendous strength and boundless confidence … neither the spear-points of the earthborn men nor the consuming flames that the savage bulls spew out will find you vulnerable.” –Argonautica 3.1022f<br>
<br>
“Iason waited for the bright constellation of the Bear to decline, and then, when all the air from heaven to earth was still, he set out like a stealthy thief across the solitary plain. During the day he had prepared himself, and so had everything he needed with him; Argos had fetched him some milk and a ewe from a farm; the rest he had taken from the ship itself. When he had found an unfrequented spot in a clear meadow under the open sky, he began by bathing his naked body reverently in the sacred river, and then put on a dark mantle which Hypsipyle of Lemnos had given him to remind him of their passionate embraces. Then he dug a pit a cubit deep, piled up billets, and laid the sheep on top of them after cutting its throat. He kindled the wood from underneath and poured mingled libations on the sacrifice, calling on Hekate Brimo to help him in the coming test. This done, he withdrew; and the dread goddess, hearing his words from the abyss, came up to accept the offering of Aison’s son. She was garlanded by fearsome snakes that coiled themselves round twigs of oak; the twinkle of a thousand torches lit the scene; and hounds of the underworld barked shrilly all around her. The whole meadow trembled under her feet, and the nymphai of marsh and river who haunt the fens by Amarantian Phasis cried out in fear. Iason was terrified; but even so, as he retreated, he did not once turn round. And so he found himself among his friends once more, and Dawn arrived.” –Argonautica 3.1194f<br>
<br>
”The beautiful Medea sped through the palace, and for her the very doors responding to her hasty incantations swung open of their own accord.” –Argonautica 4.39<br>
<br>
“She [Medea] meant to reach the temple [of Hekate]. She knew the road well enough, having often roamed in that direction searching for corpses or for noxious roots, as witches do.” –Argonautica 4.48<br>
<br>
”Rising from the distant east, the Lady Selene (Moon), Titanian goddess, saw the girl [Medea the witch] wandering distraught, and in wicked glee said to herself: ‘So I am not the only one to go astray for love, I that burn for beautiful Endymion and seek him in the Latmian cave. How many times, when I was bent on love, have you disorbed me with your incantations, making the night moonless so that you might practise your beloved witchcraft undisturbed! And now you are as lovesick as myself. The little god of mischief has given you Iason, and many a heartache with him. Well, go your way; but clever as you are, steel yourself now to face a life of sighs and misery.’ So said Selene.” –Argonautica 4.55f<br>
<br>
“As he [the Kholkian Drakon] writhed he saw the maiden [Medea] take her stand, and heard her in her sweet voice invoking Hypnos (Sleep), the conqueror of the gods, to charm him. She also called on the night-wandering Queen of the world below [Hekate] to countenance her efforts. Iason from behind looked on in terror. But the giant snake, enchanted by her song, was soon relaxing the whole of his serrated spine and smoothing out his multitudinous undulations … Medea, chanting a spell, dipped a fresh sprig of juniper in her brew and sprinkled his eyes with her most potent drug; and as the all-pervading magic scent spread round his head, sleep fell on him.” –Argonautica 4.143<br>
<br>
“She [Medea] boiled with rage. She longed to set the ship on fire, to break it up and hurl herself into the flames.” –Argonautica 4.397<br>
<br>
”She [Medea] reinforced her words with magic, scattering to the four winds spells of such potency as would have drawn wild creatures far away to come down from their mountain fastnesses.” –Argonautica 4.442<br>
<br>
“[Kirke to her niece Medea:] ‘Nor let them [the Argonauts] go too near the hateful den of Ausonian Skylla, that wicked monster borne to Phorkys by night-wandering Hekate, whom men call Kratais.” –Argonautica 4.827<br>
<br>
“I [Medea] swear by Helios’ sacred light and by the secret rites of Perses’ night-wandering Daughter [Hekate].” –Argonautica 4.1018<br>
<br>
“‘Listen to me,’ she [Medea] said [to the Argonauts]. ‘I think that I and I alone can get the better of that man, whoever he may be, unless there is immortal life in that bronze body. All I ask of you is to stay here keeping the ship out of range of his rocks till I have brought him down.’<br>
They took the ship out of range, as Medea had asked, and rested on their oars waiting to see what marvellous device she would employ. Medea went up on the deck. She covered both her cheeks with a fold of her purple mantle, and Iason led her by the hand as she passed across the benches. Then, with incantations, she invoked the Keres (Spirits of Death), the swift hounds of Hades who feed on souls and haunt the lower air to pounce on living men. She sank to her knees and called upon them, three times in song, three times with spoken prayers. She steeled herself of their malignity and bewitched the eyes of Talos with the evil in her own. She flung at him the full force of her malevolence, and in an ecstasy of rage she plied him with images of death.<br>
Is it true then, Father Zeus, that people are not killed only by disease or wounds, but can be struck down by a distant enemy? The thought appals me. Yet it was thus that Talos, for all his brazen frame, was brought down by the force of Medea’s magic. He was hoisting up some heavy stones with which tow keep them from anchorage, when he grazed his ankle on a sharp rock and the ichor ran out of him like molten lead. He stood there for a short time, high on the jutting cliff. But even his strong legs could not support him long; he began to sway, all power went out of him, and he came down with a resounding crash..” –Argonautica 4.1659<br>
<br>
“They [the Argonauts] made fast their stern cables on the Paphlagonian coast at the mouth of the River Halys. Medea had told them to land there and propitiate Hekate with a sacrifice. But with what ritual she prepared the offering, no one must hear. Nor must I let myself be tempted to describe it; my lips are sealed by awe. But the altar they built for the goddess on the beach is still there for men of a later age to see.” –Argonautica 4.245f<br>
“Now to the ancient shrine of Hecate, deep in the forest in a shady grove [in Kolkhis], she [Medea] made her way … Then by the pure rites of Hecate and by whatever Power dwelt in that grove he [Jason] swore, and by Sol [the Sun], her father’s father who sees all the world, and by his triumphs and his perils passed. Then she was sure; and straight the magic herbs she gave into his hands and taught their use [to protect himself from the flaming breath of King Aeetes metallic bulls].” –Metamorphoses 7.77f<br>
 <br>
<br>
“Then said Jason [to Medea]: ‘Dear wife … if this thing your spells can do – for what can they not do? – take from my youthful years some part and give that part to my dear father’, and his tears fell unrestrained. His live touched his wife’s heart … <br>
[Medea] answered: ‘How vile a crime has fallen from your lips! So I have power to transfer to another a period of your life! This Hecate forbids; not right nor fair is your request but more than your request, a greater boon, I’ll aim to give; not with your years I’ll dare the attempt but by my arts, to win again your father’s years long gone, if but her aid the three-formed goddess [Hekate] gives and with her presence prospers the bold tremendous enterprise.’<br>
Three nights remained before the Moon’s bright horns would meet and form her orb; then when she shone in fullest radiance and with form complete gazed down upon the sleeping lands below, Medea, barefoot, her long robe unfastened, her hair upon her shoulders falling loose, went forth alone upon her roaming way, in the deep stillness of the midnight hour. Now men and birds and beast in peace profound are lapped; no sound comes from the hedge; the leaves hang mute and still and all the dewy air is silent; nothing stirs; only the stars shimmer. Then to the stars she stretched her arms, and thrice she turned about and thrice bedewed her locks with water, thrice a wailing cry she gave, then kneeling on the stony ground, ‘O Nox (Night)’, she prayed, ‘Mother of mysteries, and all ye golden stars who with the Moon succeed the fires of day, and thou, divine, three-formed Hecate, who knowest all my enterprises and dost fortify the arts of magic, and thou, kindly Terra (Earth), who dost for magic potent herbs provide; ye winds and airs, ye mountains, lakes and streams, and all ye forest gods and gods of night be with me now! By your enabling power, at my behest, broad rivers to their source flow back, their banks are aghast; my magic song rouses the quiet, clams the angry seas; I bring the clouds and make the clouds withdraw, I call the winds and quell them; by my art I sunder serpents’ throats; the living rocks and mighty oaks from out their soil I tear; I move the forests, bid the mountains quake, the deep earth groan and ghosts rise from their tombs. Thee too, bright Luna (Moon), I banish, though thy throes the clanging bronze assuage; under my spells even my grandsire’s [Helios’] chariot grows pale and Aurora (Dawn) pales before my poison’s power. You at my prayer tempered the flaming breath of the dread bulls, you placed upon their necks, necks never yoked before, the curving plough; you turned the warriors, serpent-born, to war against themselves; you lulled at last to sleep the guardian that knew not sleep, and sent safe to the homes of Greece the golden prize.<br>
Now I have need of essences whose power will make age new, bring back the bloom of youth, the prime years win again. These you will give. For not in vain the shimmering stars have shone, nor stands in vain, by winged dragons drawn, my chariot here.’ And there the chariot stood, sent down from heaven her purpose to fulfil.<br>
She mounted, stroked the harnessed dragons’ necks, shook the light reins and soared into the sky, and gazing down beheld, far far below, Thessalian Tempe; then the serpents’ course she set for regions that she knew of old. The herbs that Pelion and Ossa bore, Othrys and Pindus and that loftiest peak, Olympus, she surveyed, and those that pleased some by the roots she culled, some with the curve of her bronze blade she cut; many she chose beside Apidanus’ green banks and many beside Amphrysus; nor was swift Enipeus exempt; Peneus too and the bright stream of broad Spercheus and the reedy shores of Boebe gave their share, and from Anthedon she plucked the grass of life …<br>
And now nine days had seen her and nine nights roaming the world, driving her dragon team. Then she returned; the dragons, though untouched save by the wafting odour of those herbs, yet sloughed their aged skins of many years. Before the doors she stopped nor crossed the threshold; only the heavens covered her; she shunned Jason’s embrace; then two turf altars built, the right to Hecate, the left to Juventas (Youth) [Hebe], wreathed with the forest’s mystic foliage, and dug two trenches in the ground beside and then performed her rites. Plunging a knife into a black sheep’s throat she drenched the wide diteches with blood; next from a chalice poured a stream of wine and from a second chalice warm frothing milk and, chanting the magic words, summoned the deities of earth and prayed the sad shades’ monarch and his stolen bride [Hades &amp; Persephone] that, of their mercy, from old Aeson’s frame they will not haste to steal the breath of life.<br>
And when in long low-murmured supplications the deities were appeased, she bade bring out the old exhausted king, and with a spell charmed him to the deepest sleep and laid his body, lifeless it seemed, stretched on a bed of herbs. Awa! She ordered Jason and Away! The ministrants, and warned that eyes profane see not her secrets; then with streaming hair, ecstatic round the flaming altars moved, and in the troughs of blood dipped cloven stakes and lit them dripping at the flames, and thrice with water, thrice with sulphur, thrice with fire purged the pale sleeping body of the king.<br>
Meanwhile within the deep bronze cauldron, white with bubbling froth, the rich elixir boils. Roots from the vales of Thessaly and seeds and flowers she seethes therein and bitter juices, with gem-stones from the farthest Orient and sand that Oceanus’ ebbing waters wash, and hoar-frost gathered when the moon shines full, and wings and flesh of owls and the warm guts of wolves that change at will to human form. To them she adds the slender scaly skins of Libyans water-snakes and then the livers of long-living gazelles and eggs and heads of ancient crows, nine generations old. With these and a thousand other nameless things her more than mortal purpose she prepared. Then with a seasoned stick of olive wood she mixed the whole and stirred it. And behold! The old dry stick that stirred the bubbling brew grew green and suddenly burst into leaf, and all at once was laden with fat olives; and where the froth flowed over from the pot and the hot drops spattered the ground beneath, fair springtime bloomed again, and everywhere flowers of the meadow sprang and pasture sweet. And seeing this Medea drew her blade and slit the old king’s throat and let the blood run out and filled his veins and arteries with her elixir; and when Aeson drank, through wound and lips, at once his hair and beard, white for long years, regained their raven hue; his wizened pallor, vanquished, fled away and firm new flesh his sunken wrinkles filled, and all his limbs were sleek and proud and strong. Then Aeson woke and marvelled as he saw his prime restored of forty years before.” –Metamorphoses 7.165-323<br>

“Then Circe turned to prayers and incantations, and unknown chants to worship unknown gods, chants which she used to eclipse Luna’s (the Moon’s) pale face and veil her father’s [the Sun’s] orb in thirsty clouds. Now too the heavens are darkened as she sings; the earth breathes vapours … They [Picus’ courtiers] changed on Circe (who by now had cleared the air and let the wind and sun disperse the mists) and charged her, rightly, with her guilt and claimed their king and threatened force and aimed their angry spears. She sprinkled round about her evil drugs and poisonous essences, and out of Erebus and Chaos called Nox (Night) and the gods of Night and poured a prayer with long-drawn wailing cries to Hecate. The woods (wonder of wonders!) leaps away, a groan came from the ground, the bushes blanched, the spattered sward was soaked with gouts of blood, stones brayed and bellowed, dogs began to bar, black snakes searmed on the solid and ghostly shapes of silent spirits floated through the air. Stunned by such magic sorcery, the group of courtiers stood aghast; and as they gazes, she touched their faces with her poisoned wand, and at its touch each took the magic form of some wild beast; none kept his proper shape.” –Metamorphoses 14.369-414<br>
