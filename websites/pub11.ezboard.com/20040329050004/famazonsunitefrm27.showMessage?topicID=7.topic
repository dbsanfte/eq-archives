She couldn't believe what she was seeing. The village was in complete shambles, it looked like it had been attacked not too long ago.<br>
<br>
She dismounted her horse, and walked through the village. Most of the huts were torn down, broken swords, chobos, daggers, and spears were scattered about everywhere. It had looked like there had been a war.<br>
<br>
Odessa found her way to the Queen's hut, and took a deep breath as she entered. It looked like it had been well guarded, seeing as it was the only hut that hadn't been damaged. The Ceremonial Mask of the Queen had been left on the bed; along with a scroll. She picked up the scroll, and read it.<br>
<br>
&quot;To my fellow Athelfi,<br>
This tribe was attacked by a group of renegade Centaurs after the Amazon/Centaur war had been won by the Amazons. We were few in numbers, and were easy prey for the vast majourity of these demons. Most of my tribe was all but gone, leaving me a Queen without a tribe. Whoever finds this scroll, I leave this village to you. I have faith in you Athelfi, faith that you'd build Paphos up again and to make it a glorious tribe of Amazons.<br>
<br>
Efharisto and Herete,<br>
<br>
Vasilissa Thalestris.&quot;<br>
<br>
Odessa bowed her head, saying a small prayer for the Amazons that have gone on. Even though Odessa was a Scynthian Amazon, she had great respect for the Goddess Artemis, and seeing as this land was on Greek Amazon Territory, she would repsect the lands and their customs. But, she knew every tribe had their own customs; she would hope that she could bring the ways of the Scynthians to Greece, but still uphold both Greecian and Scynthian Amazon standards.<br>
<br>
She exited the hut, the mask in her hands. She looked toward the North, and knelt on one knee.<br>
<br>
&quot;Atmah, please watch over these fallen Amazons. Even though they are not Scynthians, they still were our Athelfi.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then moved over to where the direction of Mount Olympus was, and bowed her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Artemis, these Amazons were loyal to you...even in death. Please, remember them and honour them...for even in death; they are our Athelfi.&quot;<br>
<br>
Odessa stood and held the Amazon Mask high in the air, letting out a War Cry.<br>

<br>
Belle dismounted the tall blonde mare, the same horse she'd been given nearly a year ago for her fifteenth. <br>
<br>
A defined brow arched slightly as she heard the warcry, and blue eyes finally shifted towards the abandoned village.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gods... what happened here?&quot; she muttered to herself with wide eyes, a soft undertone of a sigh carrying through.<br>
<br>
Biting her lower lip gently, she took a few slow, cautious steps into the lands. It was easy to tell there'd been a war, and she took a moment to bow her head in respect to those whose lives were lost, and say a silent prayer to the Atmah Cyane, before approaching Odessa.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's going on, athelfi?&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;This village was destroyed by renegade centaurs after the war. After the war, there were only a handful of Amazons left, and then they came...wiping them out but one or two and the Vasilissa.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked down to the Mask.<br>
<br>
&quot;She left a scroll, wanting whoever found it to be Queen of Paphos, to make Paphos what it was before they were wiped out.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked to the mask again, and then to Belle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Prigkipissa, I know Scynthia is my home and I know that eggonaki materas is my original Vasilissa, but...this fallen tribe needs someone to re-establish this place.

<br>
Then she smiled lightly, letting her eyes swipe unhurriedly over the village, picturing just what it could be restored to.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Atmah led you here, Dess. You're right. She'd want you to honor a last queen's wishes... Mother'd be proud.&quot;<br>
<br>
She paused, glancing around the disarrayed area once more.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know if you heard, but Aliya's very sick... I'm devoting most of my time to keeping her company while she's bedridden, but once she gets better,&quot; Belle refused to even acknowledge another option, &quot;I'll help out as best I can.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;Just focus on you, and do this for yourself, the Vasilissa who left the tribe to you, and the fallen athelfi who were killed here. I have faith in you, and so does everyone else.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;It was long decreed, Odessa. I feel I have done my part. I gave you the gifts that were passed on to me, and then allowed you to be raised by your grandmother, who I knew would bring you to greatness.&quot;<br>

Leaning, Cora kissed Odessa's temple and whispered. &quot;Remember -- tikon e terent (honor and trust). I believe in you.&quot;<br>

This was exactly what a Queen should be like. Welcoming to her fellow sisters.<br>
<br>
Alysia then turned to Arix and kneeled down.<br>
<br>
&quot;Take care of Odessa my little one.&quot;<br>
She smiled lightly as the large white wolf nuzzled the palm of her hand.<br>
&quot;She's your Queen now. Not me.&quot;<br>
<br>
And she then stood and looked to the three girls.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll see you in Scynthia soon,&quot;<br>
<br>
With that she gave them each a kiss and a hug and turned on her heels heading out the door. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#110d03><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uodessaofpaphos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Odessa of Paphos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#cc9933>(8/20/02 8:11 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/xvmegvxwpt/images/amarice_11.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Arix</span><hr size=1> She smiled and nodded to Aly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Herete.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked to Cyane, and then to Belle. These girls were important to her...and so was Xenira, believe it or not. Xenira had a great potiential as a Warrior...and an Amazon. Seeing as she held Xena's blood in her veins, she held the potiential as a great Warrior...she knew, deep down, Xenira was an Amazon at heart; whether she believed it...or not.<br>
<br>
&quot;After the Coronation in Scynthia...I'll come back here and fix the place up, it might take me a couple of days...but it's worth it.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then, I'll pick my Second Queen...and my Princess.&quot;<br>
<br>
That...was going to be a hard decision. <p>~* Odessa Sayler Loire *~

<br>
&quot;You'll make a great Queen Odessa.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled lightly but knew that many things pondered inside of Odessa's mind. She glanced between the other two girls and then with a grin she recieved a lightbulb.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have an idea. I want to take you both somewhere I've heard of, we can go there on the way to Scynthia.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cyane was obviously excited about this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#110d03><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ubelleevandaloire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Belle EvandaLoire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#cc9933>(8/23/02 3:37 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Coronation</span><hr size=1> Belle nodded in agreement, smiling.<br>
<br>
&quot;She's right, Dess. You'll be great, and we'll all be around for any help and support that you need.&quot;<br>
<br>
She raised a brow faintly at Cyane's grin and excitement. What was going on in that head of hers?<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright... where is it? Are you sure we can get there if youv'e only heard of it?&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;I'm with Belle...&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked down to the Wolf that her grandmother gave her, and smiled. <br>
<br>
&quot;I guess it's all right to leave Arixa here...to watch the lands while I'm away...&quot;<br>
<br>
She didn't know how the wolf would take to Greek lands, but...she'd probably ending up having a pack before too long. <p>~* Odessa Sayler Loire *~

&quot;If I know where I want to go, I can get there.&quot;<br>
<br>
She closed her eyes and transported each of them out of the lands.<br>
When they reappeared they were in a dark land. Where the mist grew around them quickly. They stood in a caved area where crystals lit the top of the rocky area.<br>
<br>
Cyane smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;We're here.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then began to walk down through the cave until she came upon a large pool of water.<br>

<br>
&quot;It tells the future.&quot; She took a gulp and looked down within the waters.<br>
<br>
As she did, she could see herself in a bright land where she stood tall as a warrior clad in armour and leathers. And as she walked into the lands, a group of lions surrounded her and one walked forward bearing a mark on it's forearm. <br>
&quot;Faith.&quot; she said quietly.<br>
<br>
This was foretelling the future of Cyane's place in the Kakos Lands of Africa where Faith would eventually become Queen under Cyane.<br>
