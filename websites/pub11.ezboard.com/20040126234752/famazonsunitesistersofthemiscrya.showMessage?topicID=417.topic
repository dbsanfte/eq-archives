A young woman was the cause. Her bright blue eyes found the gate to the distane village comming up. She stayed aware knowing there would be some kind of guard. Her straight dark hair trailed behind her as she walked. She was almost the same image of Xena, but of course she wasn't her, nor was she related in anyway. She wore a black bare midriff top and black leather pants with slits up the sides, that were tied and held together. The ties criss-crossed up the outsides of her legs. Strapped across her back  was her new sword. A few daggars were housed in her boots as well. She walked on, still expecting someting, anything, or anyone to pop out at her.She had no idea where she was. But around her neck would be something helpful in this neck of the woods. It was around her neck when she was found as a baby. The symbol of the Amazons. Of course she did not know thats what it is. <p><br>

As she walked, she noticed a woman walking ahead of her, she raised a dark brow. It was definitly not someone she knew, or seen around the amazon villages or nations for that matter. <br>
Looking up, she reached for a large tree branch, lifting herself up one handed and grabbing for another branch with her other arm. Once finly situated ontop of the tree, she jumped from branch to branch. Her noises shielded by the usual forest animals...She made her way infront of the woman who was walking and jumped from the trees, landing squarly infront of her. She looked at the woman.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you.&quot;<br>

<br>
She got up and put on her warm bearskin cloak, grabbing her facemask, she placed it on, but leaving it up, as to not cover her face. After lacing her boots, she headed out to the spot they were at.  As the girl spoke of questions and answered, she appeared behind Eponin. Placing a hand on the warrior's shoulder. She looked to the girl with her sea green eyes. She looked to the labrys around her neck, A common symbol worn all over the nation, it symbolized the female spirit of freedom.<br>
Suddenly, she spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Themiscrya has been called the heart of the Amazon Nation, The Sisters of Thjemiscrya is one of the oldest tribes, following another, that is no more. Tho its Queen is now our War Queen.'<br>

She pushed a stand of wild brown hair from her eyes<br>
<br>
&quot;And how do you suppose we seek these answers you are looking for? Many Amazons have come and go. And many more will come, and go as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
De'Lerium was not that cold hearted, she did want to help, she, herself did not know about where she came from, Hippolyte took her in and taught her all she knew. She waited for the girl to speak.<br>

<br>
&quot;When I was a young girl growing up with the woman who took me in,I was always different from the other girls. I was independent, brave, and strong. My foster mother always called me her 'little amazon'. I had no idea what it really meant. She told me once if I wanted to know who I was to come here..to the amazon nation. Now I am realizing that maybe, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>you</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> don't have the answers i'm looking for, but that the answer <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>is</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>nation</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->...&quot; <br>
<br>
Her eyes looked away.<br>
<br>
&quot;But..if i  am wrong and that is not the answer...I have no home to go to, and maybe  the amazon nation would be the place i belong, even if it is not from my past.&quot;  <br>

 &quot;Why dont we go and see if she is in Del....it being this early in the morning, I am sure that the old witch is still in her hut. &quot; she replied with a smile. <br>
 Solari liked and respected the shamaness, but did remember fondly of the torment she used to put her through growing up. ~ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xangeleyes>xAngel Eyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#993300>(1/27/03 6:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=417.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.adventureinc.net/images/episodic/108/pics_108_13.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Village</span><hr size=1> Makeida looked between to three women.

As they approached the entrance to the hut, Solari heard the old witch inside grumbling about something. <br>
 &quot;Hey, old witch, you' ve got company.&quot; she said. <br>
  <br>
  The old lady opened the door and stood there looking at Solari. She was a short amazon, her hair was silver and her skin wrinkled, but her  green eyes were still as young as a child's, filled with the wisdom and knowledge of 3 lifetimes. She gave Solari a dirty look for the old witch comment, before looking to the Queen and bowing. The old shamaness moved aside and offered her home to her visitors.<br>
  &quot;What has brought you to my home?&quot; the shamaness asked in a old vioce.~ <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left
