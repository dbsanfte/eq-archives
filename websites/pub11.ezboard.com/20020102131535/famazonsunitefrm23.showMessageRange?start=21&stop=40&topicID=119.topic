The rancor of the other immortals has waken him. He yawns loudly as he lifts his arms into the air stretching his body. He drops the rose from his hand and wipes his eyes with his hand, fingers curled up. Poseidon rises slowly from the base of the tree and cracks his neck and knuckles. He walks slowly to the border of the garden without saying a word to anyone else. He notices Hecate, that dark goddess in the corner of his eye. He turns to her for a second and heads to his room. Turning the nob slowly with his left hand Poseidon pulls the door open without a sound. He closes the door behind him as he walks into his bed chamber. Torches from every corner of the room illuminate the dark room and the windows are covered with sea blue shades. Poseidon strips down and puts all of his attire on a rack by his closet in the bedroom, opposite the bed. Taking long strides Poseidon walks to his bed and sits down on the edge. He then falls back with his hands up over his head and his eyes closed. He moves around a little and turns over on his right side holding both palms together under his head.
