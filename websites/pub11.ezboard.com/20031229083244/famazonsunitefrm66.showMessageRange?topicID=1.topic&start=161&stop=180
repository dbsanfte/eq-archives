His purpose was sure to rape her.  And Hippolyte knew it.  She began to struggle even harder at her binds as he laughed. &quot;Yes, that's it struggle as I take you.  Weak woman you are not match.&quot;<br>
<br>
But, outside one of the lookouts quickly noticed the some of the wolves that had begun to surround the village.  And word got out quickly.  A man ran into the hut of the captor yelling, &quot;Marxus, there are wolves in the village.  Those beasts of the forests are sending their kind!&quot;<br>
<br>
Now she knew his name and would not forget it.  This man would die.  She would be sure of it and watch.  <br>
<br>
Marxus turned around facing the man who entered.  &quot;Come man, don't tell me a couple wolves have you scared.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But, Marxus...it is more then a couple wolves.&quot;  Just as he spoke they could hear one of the few dogs of the village getting into a fight with one of the wolves.<br>
<br>
Marxus cursed, &quot;Go, I will be out in a minute.&quot;  The man ran out and Marxus turned to his captive.  &quot;Don't worry, I will be back.&quot; He then send the back of his hand across her cheek.  &quot;And that is for thinking of ways to get loose.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hipps head was knocked hard into the post again, and then she turned to face him again.  Watching him leave the hut, she now could taste the blood on her lips again.  <br>
<br>
Looking up at the top of the roof, she let a tear fall finally from one corner of an eye.  &quot;Hera, have you left me?&quot; <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

 Solari managed to rest a bit before those who were sent out to get the information were due back. The pain in her body was subsiding, not that a little pain was going to stop Solari anyway. She thought about what had been discussed with Hera and prayed that Hippolyta was holding out. She was really going to make the Roman that took her suffer. Solari was going to kill him herself, but she thought about it further and decided that he needed to have a dose of his own medicine and therefore, she was going to take him captive, so everyone could relish in a kill.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daughterofshylock>Daughter of Shylock</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.picturesof.net/_wallpaper/rose_Dsc08151_WP.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 299<br> <font color=#993300>(4/21/03 10:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm66.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=169>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.picturesof.net/_wallpaper/rose_Dsc08151_WP.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: tests</span><hr size=1> Alysia growled as she could hear the men shouting.

Scythe growled as it continued fighting.<br>
&quot;It spotted my pack my Queen.&quot;<br>

Alysia pawed closer and shouted.<br>
&quot;Then kill the darn thing so that we may continue.&quot;<br>

Scythe growled lowly to the dog and in front of one of the Roman men that had come closer, ripped out the throat of the animal.<br>

Alysia shouted.<br>
&quot;Mask yourselves!&quot;<br>
<br>
Each white wolf did as they were told and adapted into the shadows becomming unseen to mortal eyes.<br>
<br>
Alysia however was different. She, Arixa and Aeceus pawed closer to the village. Romans had seen them. And if they knew exactly what was going on, they would hurt Hippolyte for it. Aly wouldn't allow that to happen.<br>
<br>
She came as close as she could to the tent where Hippolyte was kept. The Roman who saw the wolves would pay for this. And his blood would soon be brought by the wolf Queen. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">~*~ Jessica ~*~<br>

Solari grabbed her cloak from her bag and placed it over her as she walked out to greet Mel. <br>
 &quot;Come inside and get out of this rain child.&quot; Solari said soothingly. &quot;Hipp will kill me if you catch a cold.&quot; Solari's uncanny sense of feeling told her that Mel was upset and had been crying. She felt her emotion with a great deal of compassion and took her into her arms, giving her a reassuring hug that things would be ok. <br>
 &quot;Would you like anything to eat or drink? There isnt much here, but i do have a few things in my bag.&quot; She asked softly as they made their way back into the shelter where Solari had been.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=odessaofpaphos>Odessa of Paphos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon Queen</span><br>  Posts: 211<br> <font color=#993300>(4/24/03 4:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm66.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=172>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/xvmegvxwpt/images/amarice_11.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Enter Melanippe Hipp's sister</span><hr size=1> She came back to Solari after praying, wet and cold; but it didn't seem to bother the Scynthian Queen of Paphos.

Mel sat down on a nearby chair. Wipping her eyes with the edge of her outfit. She managed a weak smile and nodded her head in reply yes to the food. She was starving from the ride and the rain didn't help her mood any.<br>

She looked forward and purposely stepped down on a small trig making a noise to bring the Roman guard towards her, and stupid as he was . . . he did.<br>
<br>
She looked to Arixa.<br>
<br>
&quot;When you get my signal, call the others to one by one pick off the guards that come near that tent. Whoever is inside with Hippolyte won't notice his men are missing since he appears to be keeping himself busy with our athelfi. Then, get back to the village and tell Odessa to let Solari know what we know now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Alysia's bright eyes turned back as the Roman came close. The other men were gathered around a small campfire. A few of them were off scouting the woods, and without their knowledge, each was followed closely by a wolf.<br>
As he came within leaping distance, Alysia barked, &quot;Go Arixa.&quot; At which Arixa left into the woods giving soft barking sounds that the Scynthian wolves could hear and obey. The young wolf turned back to see Alysia.<br>
<br>
Alysia grinned deviously as she jumped towards the Roman, and giving him no chance to scream, her teeth instantly sunk into his throat tackling him to the ground.<br>

Arixa dashed into the camp and came swiftly to Odessa nudging her leg. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hippolyte>Hippolyte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 867<br> <font color=#993300>(4/25/03 9:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm66.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=175>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/Hippwknife1ezboard.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Prey and Predator</span><hr size=1> The romans fought off the few wolves that could see, cursing the one who killed one of their dogs.  Meanwhile, their leader believed there was more to this than it seemed.  Standing at the door of his hut with one of his men, he watched as finally the village woke up and began to properly defend itself.  Then he nodded to his friend and walked back into the hut.<br>
<br>
Walking inside, he walked up to Hippolyte.  &quot;Tell me about the wolves outside.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hippolyte's eyes showed no emotion.  But, when he mentioned the wolves she knew that the Scythians were there.  She had heard the sound of the wolves and then the dog fighting.  But, she could not be sure....now she was.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me slave..what is it with the wolves outside.  They are not normal wolves are they?&quot;<br>
<br>
Still, Hippolyte showed no emotion nor spoke any word.  <br>
<br>
Her captor just laughed and then got a wicked grin.  &quot;You don't have to tell me anything.&quot;  He untied her and grabbed the ropes that held her wrists together. And then pushed her towards the door.  &quot;We will see what these wolves are for.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kicking the door open, he then shoved Hippolyte forward and then yanked her back.  Standing behind her, he quickly pressed a dagger into the side of her throat.  Pressing so hard that a small droplet of blood began to seep.  &quot;Wolves, I suggest that you leave now...or this ...beast dies.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Beast?  Had Hippolyte heard him right.  Was her captor beginning to believe the myths of the beast women of the forests? <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

Nearly ten white wolves darted back into the forests making it clear that they had left. Alysia, Aeceus and Scythe however remained with a few others hiding in the shadows.<br>
<br>
Alysia closed her eyes feeling that Arixa was not aware of the news. She was in wolf form, but hoped that Odessa would recieve her message through mind link.<br>

~Magna Kouri, Hippolyte lives, but the Romans have spotted a few of our wolves and know who we are. I sent back ten of the pack leaving only one here with me and others scouting the woods.
