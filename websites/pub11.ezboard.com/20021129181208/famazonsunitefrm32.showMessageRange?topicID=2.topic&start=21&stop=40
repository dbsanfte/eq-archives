Not wanting to make a noise as the ceremony had suddenly began, Hera nodded to Nike and gave her a slight smile.  Then again turning her icy blue eyes to the couple as they were joined.  <br>

The ceremony was beautiful she thought.  As Peleus invited all the guests to enjoy the feast, Hera stood there still, a bit irratated at her husband.

<br>
Peleus, being mortal, was unsure exactly of Eris's powers and watched her carefully.  He jumped as she slapped him and then continued to watch her as she began to move among the Goddesses. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenhera.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Queen Hera</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 159<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(10/23/01 4:56:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/qherarpg.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Arrival of Eris</span><hr size=1> As her daughter appeared, Hera watched her carefully.  She had known there was no way to keep a Goddess or God from knowing when the Olympians congregated.  It was like a great power being given off to all immortal.  Her pale icy blue eyes danced over to her other two daughters who quietly watched the middle child.<br>
<br>
Hebe held Eiliethyia in her arms gently.  The two had become close, the eldest and youngest children of the King of the Gods.  Hebe, always the quiet and calmest of the children of couple, frowned watching her sister quietly.  As Eilie smiled gently, excited that something interesting might actually be happening.  It had gotten a little boring as everyone had begun to eat.<br>
<br>
Hera took in a deep breath as her daughter seemed to be on the prowl.  She folded her arms in front of her and wandered exactly what kind of game Eris was wanting to play between she, Aphrodite and Athena.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, tell us daughter.

His shining blue eyes bounced around the lavish area, a smile rode across his face. He just loved a good wedding.<br>
<br>
His dress, rivaled that of the groom himself, and quite possibly, the bride. Upon his head was a laurel crown of crystal, in which he only wore to large occasion such as this. Wrapped around his body, was a a midnight blue cape, a large &quot;A&quot; enscribed on the back. It seemed as if he was a floating head, the cape covered his entire body. As he entered the room it seemed to glow with a warm golden light. Around him gathered his aunterage, the Muses and such. He lifted his hand and untied the cape and took it from his person, and extending his hand dropped it. It landed upon a nymph, who giggled.<br>
<br>
Under his cape was a white tunic, covered in a light see-through of azure. Upon his shoulders were the clips to his knee-length cape, golden and enscribed upon them, his emblem. The tunic had wide sleeves, and were dyed azure in certain spots (giving a tie dyed affect).<br>
<br>
He shook the hair from his head and looked around, seeing the usual gathering of family and friends. He quickly, and without hesitation made his way to Artemis, who he enveloped in his embrace. He pulled her away from him and smiled. He smirked and whispered:<br>
<br>
&quot;Tis to be quite an event, this...wedding. I feel it in my bones!&quot; he laughed as he walked from his sister over to his step-mother, Queen Hera.<br>
<br>
&quot;And don't we look snazzy this evening?&quot; he laughed to his father, as he eyed Hera.<br>
<br>
Apollo made his way around the room, making his hello's and dispensing his greetings.<br>
He'd wait though, for the bride and groom to come to him. He was approachable, but still a figure of authority and didn't want to look to soft.<br>
<br>
&quot;Blah...&quot; he murmered to himself. Little did he or anyone know how perfectly this utterance would sum up the event.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/unikeqofv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NikeQofV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 105<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(10/23/01 7:17:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.btinternet.com/~dave.newton/lysette-anthony/pictures/lysette-anthony109.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Arrival of Eris</span><hr size=1> ::Shakes her head and laughs and says to Athena, Artemis and Aphrodite:: Forget her girls, this isn't about Eris, its a about the wedding and preventing anything or &quot;anyone&quot; from spoiling this occaision ::smiles at them all reassuringly.
