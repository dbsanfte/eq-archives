Belle was an Amazon and Alysia's daughter. She was the perfect choice. <br>
<br>
Although Aly had other daughters whom she loved equally as Belle, they all had their other places in the world and Aly wouldn't dream of taking them from that.<br>
<br>
Belle however was an amazon and she had a place there. She had a family and a home now. All that was left was the coronation.<br>
<br>
Alysia stood in the sweat hut helping Belle prepare for the ritual. &quot;Don't forget everything I taught you as of lately. And remember, it's not a test, just an introduction to the tribe, to make things official.&quot;<br>
<br>
She took Belle's blonde hair in her hands as she braided the sides pinning them together with sacred amazon feathers. <br>
<br>
&quot;The Amazons might be a little stand off for the first little while, but there are those few that extend immediate blessings to fellow athelfi.&quot; She smiled as she took a piece of leather string and tied Belle's braids together in the back.<br>
<br>
&quot;Did you remember to set out your outfit for today?&quot;<br>

<br>
She pulled on her braid slightly, as she often did when she was nervous. She had become an initiate and a princess all in the same week...<br>

She bit her lower lip nervously, eyes darting about the room. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualysiaofscynthia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alysia of Scynthia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#993300>(5/11/01 11:30:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=134.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Coronation of Princess Belle</span><hr size=1> Aly smiled as she walked over to a section of the hut where she kept her own hair pieces as she began to pull her own hair up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just words of wisdom sweetie.&quot;<br>
<br>
She walked over to her cleansing table and ran her hands through the smoke of some inscense burning near the water. She dipped her hands into the cold water and brought them to her face as she tried to cool herself down a bit. Alot had happened that week and for some reason, she herself was nervous.<br>
<br>
&quot;The tribe will love you darling.&quot; She smiled as she padded a dry cloth over her wet face looking at Belle.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I never thought I'd actually be preparing one of my daughters for a ritual like this.&quot; She smiled as she walked over to Belle pinning some Scynthian ritual beads to her top.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm very proud of you Belle.&quot;<br>

She then took a ceremonial dagger and placed it in Belle's boots. She then walked over to where she had a medium sized staff and she placed a wolf medallion at the top of it and smoothed her hand over the wolf fure wrapped around the top.

&quot;I'll give you a moment to yourself to calm down a bit. Perhaps you can take this time to make peace with the Ancients.&quot; She smiled and took the staff in her hands and held it out to Belle.<br>
<br>
&quot;I made this for you last night. It's a ceremonial staff. Not used to fighting, but for the symbol of your place here.&quot; She smiled once again and handed the staff to Belle.<br>

After a moment or two of silently making piece with her mother, she glanced at a bracelet on her wrist. She'd been told it was an Amazon bracelet, and it'd be found on her wrist the day she was brought to Rome as an infant, so she could only assume it was from her mother.<br>

She had called a meeting of Scynthia for the sisters to introduce the new Princess of the tribe. She looked out to her athelfi and smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is so good to see so many sisters united together in one tribe. I come to you today to introduce a new sister to the tribe. Rumors have gone through Scynthia I have seen. Yes, this girl that stands before you is my adopted daughter, yes she was a mere initiate last week. However, because she is my daughter by Amazon Law, it makes her an Amazon Princess. And seeing that my other daughters have other responsibilities which I will not deny them, Belle shall take the official position in this tribe.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked out to see the other sisters whispering and talking amongst themselves.<br>
<br>
&quot;When I was given word to Cora's resignation from her position in the tribe, I was both worried and saddened by this news. Cora however did not fit the position. She has a place somewhere else, with her own growing family. I am glad she has chosen for her happiness. I adopted Belle not knowing that she would take this place in our tribe. She has both the rite and the will to do so. When I pass on, I will be happy knowing that this tribe and the future of Scynthia is in Belle's hands along with the help from many sisters as I have been.&quot;<br>

She smirked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't get me wrong. I am not dieing anytime soon.&quot; She let out a small laugh.<br>
&quot;I know this adjustment may not be easy for some. But it is what I have chosen to do. I trust Belle with the safety of the tribe. I ask now for you to bestow upon her your thoughts and blessings if possible. If you have none, then at least introduce yourself to her.&quot;<br>

She had just gotten the news that morning.  That this amazon, that Aly had spoken to her off, was going to be crowned the princess of Scynthia.  This Hipp had to see herself.  She wanted to see what this amazon raised in Rome was like.  Her brown eyes watched the procedings and then glanced around to see the different Amazons reactions to someone new taking a royal position.  Hipp didn't have much to say about it.  So, she just sat back on her saddle.  This was Alysia's lands, and thusly...it was her word here. <br>
Hippolyte glanced over the new princess initiate cautiously.  But, decided she would know more once she was one on one with this princess.  In a crowd, there was no way to know someone's real soul.  She would trust Aly's judgement. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenhera.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Queen Hera</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen of the Gods</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#993300>(5/17/01 12:24:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=134.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Initiate Princess</span><hr size=1> ~~Hera appeared beside Hippolyte's steed.

Hera smiled proudly up at the woman she had reared from an infant.

&quot;Yes, grandmother,&quot; she answered softly. &quot;Most will be very unsure of an initiate raised in Rome as their Princess.

"Then... I would suggest you go down there and support the young amazon," Hera raised a brow and looked up at Hippolyte. "Don't you always say.. Amazons Unite?"<br>
The Queen of the Gods then turned her icy gaze back down to the Scynthians.<br>

She had always been thankful to Hera for rearing her.  <br>
Hipp chuckled at Hera's obvious remark. &quot;Yes, mam. I will go now,&quot; she said and then urged her horse down the hillside to the village and the ceremony.<br>
As she reached the others, she slowed her steed to a slow walk and slowely rode up to the stand.  She stopped her mare and gazed up at Belle.  Her brown eyes now roamed the princess initiate, with having a closer look.  Then slowely raised her hands to bring her wrist gauntlets together in a clink of amazon salute.<br>
&quot;Yasoo athelfi.  Welcome this day your athelfi stand before you.  For it is not for you that you become Princess of this tribe.  It is for them,&quot; Hipp motions to the athelfi standing around. &quot;Make them proud and make them remember you in good name.  Show them your heart and soul is for the Amazon Nation and this tribe.  For it is for them that you now live.&quot;<br>
Hipp gazed at her quietly for a bit watching the young one on the dais. Then a warm smile finally reaches her face. &quot;And we will sing of your name. Blessings, Princess Belle.&quot;<br>
With that and a click of her tongue...Hippolyte's steed began to back up slowely, walking backwards away from Alysia and Belle..pushing the amazons out of it's way.<br>
Then with a customary smirk, she spun the horse around and took off into the woods to the south.  Home to Themiscrya. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=134.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=134.topic&start=41&stop=41>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessage?topicID=145.topic"> << Prev Topic </a> &nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessage?topicID=139.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=134.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=134.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.threadControl?topicID=134.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=134.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=134.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm17">Amazons of Phylace<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm24">Evander's Army<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6>Amazons of the Northern Lands</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://hometown.aol.com/queenhippolyte/SoT.html">Home</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.2 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
