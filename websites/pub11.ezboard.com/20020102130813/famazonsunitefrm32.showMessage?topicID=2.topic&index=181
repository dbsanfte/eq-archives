<br>
&quot;Hmmm..to tell you the truth.  I would have to dissect the thing in order to examine how it was made.  However, it is possible that this is one natural growing, being of the famed Golden Apples of Hesperides.  Though that is only speculation.&quot;<br>

By some strange will of Zeus she had landed the hand of Menelaus King of Sparta. His hand raised as it ran through his hair. He must was needed in Troy. Word had reached him that his father had entered his prize bull in the yearly competition, without his permission. He needed to get him back soon.<br>
<br>
Paris made his way out of the banquet hall, the wedding was basically over. Almost everyone was gone, besides Apollo sitting by himself, in a corner, rubbing his chin. Paris's eyebrow perked, but shook his head smiling. No use in wondering. Paris made his way down the hill on which the temple was built, to the main road.  He stood there for a time, looking for someone to get a ride to the pier from. A farmer strode by on his wagon, pulled by a mule. Paris raised his fair hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Umm, excuse me sir?&quot; Paris smiled, and the man slowly came to a stop.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you heading to the docks?&quot; <br>
<br>
The man coughed, clearing his throat and smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why actually, yes I am. Hop on, I'll give you a ride.&quot; the kind man smiled and watched as Paris climbed atop the wagon.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you sir.&quot; Paris smiled. The day had been so perfect. <br>
