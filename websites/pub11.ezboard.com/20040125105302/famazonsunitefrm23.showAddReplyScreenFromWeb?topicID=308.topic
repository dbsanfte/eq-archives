His muscles were in quite a bit of pain, as he was working the forge overtime, as per usual. He particularly immersed himself in his work, this time, due to his guilt over the Athena situation. It had finally gotten to the point where his muscles could not take anymore, they burned like the fire that was within his forge::<br>
<br>
::He hobbled over to his table and sat down, and poured himself a glass of wine. He sat silently and drank, letting thoughts run through his head. Within his forge, while he worked he seemed to forget the world...even himself. Now everything was cathing up to him. He finished the glass of wine and looked into the forge::<br>
<br>
::He saw some of the cyclopes hard at work. He sighed and spoke out:: &quot;I shall return eventually...I need a break.&quot;<br>
<br>
::The cyclopes looked up for a moment, smiled to him and then continued their work:: <br>
<br>
::Hephaestus grabbed his walking crutch and disappeared in a cloud of soot and smoke. Not a few moments later, he appeared on the beach of the island of Lemnos. Ever since his father, Zeus, had thrown him off Olympus and he landed her, after trying to stop a fight between Zeus and Hera, this place had become somewhat special to him. The residents had nursed him back to health, and he in turn took a certain liking to them.::<br>
<br>
::He looked around and disrobed his clothing. After working the forge for as long as he has, he had developed quite a build. He wasn't quite as well chiseled as perhaps some of the other Olympians, but he equalled, if not surpassed, quite a few of them in strength. He looked down at his lame leg and shook his head. He immediatly headed into the ocean for a swim. He was pretty average looking, which by Olympian standards could be considered ugly, but it was his bum leg that truley made him horrid in the eyes of the Olympians. He waded in the ocean, trying to forget all of his worries::<br>
<br>
::As he was swimming around on the shore, he started chanting a rhyme he learned when he was young:<br>
<br>
&quot;Nobody loves me, everybody hates me;<br>
Guess I'll go eat worms,<br>
Big fat juicy ones<br>
Little itty bitty skinny ones<br>
Guess I'll go eat worms!&quot;<br>
<br>
::He shook his head and laughed to himself::<br>
<br>
::Mutters under his breath:: &quot;Boy, oh, boy did I hate my childhood.&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ixhephaestusxi>IX Hephaestus XI</A> at: 4/8/03 11:06:24 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ixhephaestusxi>IX Hephaestus XI</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(4/8/03 10:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=308.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Work-a-holic</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://elfwood.lysator.liu.se/loth/v/a/vasilis/hephaestus.jpg.html"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ixhephaestusxi>IX Hephaestus XI</A> at: 4/8/03 11:06:51 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=persephoneqofu>PersephoneQofU</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 171<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(4/8/03 4:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=308.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.aishwarya-rai.com/tradi/tash16.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> A Nice Hello</span><hr size=1> ::Persephone appears on the beach in a soft little lawn chair with a shade and with a glass of ambrosia wine in her hand.

He did not expect to hear or even see anyone let alone have someone join him for company. It was a pleasant suprise.::<br>
<br>
::He did not know if Persephone was being sarcastic with her first comment, but he was used to being teased, so he shrugged it off. He started wading to the shoreline, as the water got lower and lower on him, his limp became apparent. He had no shame of his body, therefore did not bother covering up as he approached the chair beside Persephone. He took the towel from that chair and dried himself off. He then wrapped the towel around his waist, then running his hands through his hair and his beard, trying to keep them from knotting up. He then picked up the honeysuckle pie and sat down in the chair beside her, then of course producing his own goblet::<br>
<br>
::Hephaestus then cordially smiled to Persephone in thanks, and spoke up laughingly:: &quot;Actually, I'd be more afraid to find Hades reaction FOR sitting next to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
::He then took a deep sigh and a small bite from the pie:: &quot;Mmmm...as usual, superb. So anyway, you recently returned from Tartarus, didn't you? Anything new down there?&quot;<br>
<br>
::He then stretched a little bit before taking another bite and a sip from his wine goblet:: &quot;I've been meaning to go down there...check up on the chains that hold the Titans' Door closed, make sure they are still secure. Also, I need to lobby Hades for some fresh gems and jewels, I'm running low and have some ideas for jewlery and weapons that need them. I finally got ahead on work, so I'm taking some time off.

As he walks over to her with his masculine 'definition' in the open, she turns her head away, covering her eyes with her hands while showing an innocent blush with an adorable giggle. Even though she had been to bed with Hades, it still made her bashful to see a man's possesions. Looking at him as he sat down, she listens to him with genuine interest as he rambles on and on animatedly. She knew that he did not get a chance to do that much, especially with their type of peers around. Upon hearing his comment on Hades, she breaks out in fun laughter::<br>
<br>
Perhaps, but then again, so many people are afraid of Hades. Although he can be terrifying when he wants to be, he is pretty calm and mellow most of the time. Do you know that most mortals fear to even say his name openly and in vain, even more so than Zeus himself. To anwser your next question, I can't really say that anything is new in Tartarus. Same old cold, boring,scary atmostsphere. I keep telling Hades that we should move our palace to the Elysian Fields where its much more beautiful, but he insists that he has to keep a close eye on the souls that are damned. You'd think that was that darned three-headed dog's job. You know he almost bit my head off when I tried to run away the first time. I would have escaped if he hadn't seen my aura.<br>
<br>
::Taking a sip, She looks out at the lush ocean and the sea birds flying in the salty breeze:: Now that you mention the chains, they are a bit rusty. Last eon, a soul tried to open them up and the Titans almost escaped. Thank goodness a few of the other gods were down there, it could have been chaos. <br>
<br>
::Upon hearing his request for stones, Persephone laughs plentifully:: Oh Hephaestus, you know perfectly well that you many take as many stones as you like. We always have more than we'd like to handle. And speaking of weapons, do you think you could make great sword with black diamonds encrusted on a hilt made of silver? I think it would be a wonderful gift for Hades! If it isn't too much trouble to do, I'd greatly appreciate it.<br>
<br>
::Putting her empty plate aside, she wipes her lips daintily with a soft little hanky:: I don't really have any new plans for this spring. I'll help my mother around as usual. If anything, I'm looking forward to Hades visiting me when my mother isn't home. Its hard but I think we can work around it. My mother's demi-god friends are thinking of throwing a welcome home gala in my honor, but I asked them not to because I don't think anyone would really come. And wouldn't that make me look stupid.. <br>
<br>
::Taking a sip of wine, she stops sipping abruptly, putting her glass down. Many goddesses were now afraid to be around Hephaestus after the rape of Athena, but Persephone wasn't scared. She knew Hephaestus cared about her too much to do that. Not to mention the wrath of Hades and Demeter against him would be unstoppable. Turning towards him, she speaks to Hephaestus in a gentle voice and her eyes full of understanding. :: Hephaestus, I want to ask you a question. Remember how to came to Athena and, well....you know. What made you want to do it, I mean, it just seemed so strange. Like it wasn't even you.<br>

<br>
::The smile left Hephaestus' face as he sighed deeply, then took a deep drink from his goblet of wine, finishing off whatever was in there::<br>

&quot;Truth be known, I have desired Athena for quite some time...&quot; ::He smiled slightly and seemed to stare off into space as he spoke:: &quot;Almost literally since I helped 'birth' her, by opening up Zeus's head to aleviate his headache and thus freeing her.&quot;<br>
<br>
::The smile left his face almost as quickly as it came:: &quot;Apparently, Poseidon wanted revenge on Athena for some rivalry they have. So, Poseidon played upon my deepest heart's desire, and told me that Athena had mutual feelings for me, that she felt the same about me that I felt about her. I should have known better; known that it was too good to be true...but I wanted to believe it with my whole heart. She came to my forge in Mt. Aetna. My desires overtook my reason and I attacked her. I guess part of me felt, that Zeus, Apollo, Aries and countless other gods, take whatever or whomever they want, regardless of whether they are wanted in return. I guess and inkling within me felt the same liberty, especially convinced that she DID want me.&quot; ::He looked right at Persephone:: &quot;Even Hades...went and took what he desired without asking.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;But the difference is, that I failed. Also, I think I'm experiences that none of the other gods feel after being successful at such an act. Remorse. Guilt. Which is why I disappeared to my forge. To lose myself in my work again. I worked for months nonstop until my muscles could not take anymore, so now...I am here, trying to relax, trying to find new ways to forget myself.&quot;<br>

Poseidon should be damned for what he did to you. I can understand why you did what you did. In a way, it wasn't your fault seeing as how you thought she actually cared for you and that taking what you wanted is a prevalent gene with the males in our family. As far as Hades goes, considering the fact that he asked my father for my hand in marriage, that qualified him as asking before taking.  ::Smiling faintly, she shakes her head:: But to this day, even with my dear Hades, it feels like he took what he wanted without permission. Although the thing about him raping me was a very weird rumor. Aside from kidnapping me,he never touched me. <br>
<br>
::looking at Hephaestus with her light golden eyes full of compassion:: but the main thing is that you felt guilt. Which is something that almost all the gods do not have the dignity to feel after doing such a violating thing let alone attempting to do it. ::Leaning over, she kisses him gently on the lips and smiles lovingly:: and that is what makes you so much greater than all the rest.. <p>*~* Persephone...Queen of the Underworld..

&quot;Persephone, truthfully I think Hades loved you from the moment he laid eyes on you, and he never stopped loving you. As far as Menthe goes, it may have been a momentary lapse of reason. All of us are prone to them. He may have been bitter about the six month deal...it could be any number of reasons. Hades is not one to cheat regularly, if at all.
