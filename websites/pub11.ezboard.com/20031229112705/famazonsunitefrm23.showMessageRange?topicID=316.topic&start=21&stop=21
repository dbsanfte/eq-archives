Poseidon bid his company farwell as he was escorted to his palace. <br>
<br>
The palace was full of occupants of the sea, goddesses, and gods. The sea god waved his male servants off and told them to have some female servants come to the bathroom to wash him down and oil him up. While he awaited the arrival of his maids Poseidon started to remove his clothes and toss them onto the floor. The maidens arrived in a hurry and as some took off the rest of Poseidon's clothes others filled the bath with warm water. Now nude and ready to bathe Poseidon entered the bath and sat down and then the maidens began to soap him down and wash his hair. In the middle of chatting with them Poseidon brought up his wife and asked for news of her. The maidens told him that she had been gone for some time and they had no idea where she had gone off to. That was all Poseidon could get out of them during his bathing session. <br>
<br>
After that he had been in his study alone and wondered how Amphitrite could leave without informing anyone of where she was headed off to. The god did not like the feeling he was getting so he left his study and began to ask around for news of where his wife had gone. Everyone was as lost as he was as to her whereabouts. Poseidon began to grow angry and demanded that all go and search for news of her.<br>
<br>
While all went to search for any news of Amphitrite the god attended a dinner in his banquet hall with some of the sea dieties. Poseidon did not talk much and barely touched his food at the dinner table. Then in walked one of his servants and they informed him that there was one person who they found that had some news of Amphitrite. He called for him to have her meet him in his study immediately. He left dinner abruptly, apologizing to his guests and when when he entered his study he walked in on a neried. She had told him all about the letter his wife got from Athena, the contents of which the neried did not know, and how his wife left to go and meet up with the Olympian goddess. Poseidon thanked the neried and had her escorted out of his palace with some treasure for her deed. <br>
<br>
Poseidon figured immediately that Amphitrite might be the pawn in some scheme of Athena and had his servants get his trident and armour from the armoury. He was then fitted with a helmet, shin guards, and a coat of golden mail. The chariot had been made ready for him and upon entering it pulled back on the reigns of the yoked horses, shouted in a loud voice with his trident held high in pride and made off to Athena's temple.<br>
<br>
It did not take long to get to the temple he figured Athena was at because his wife's own chariot was still standing outside of it. He pulled his chariot up beside her's and got off and made his way into Athena's temple. The angry god barged into the temple, and his enflamed eyes glared at Zeus' favorite. He did not see his wife there and shouted out to Athena, 'What have you done Athena!', while pointing his trident at her from across the hall. <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses
