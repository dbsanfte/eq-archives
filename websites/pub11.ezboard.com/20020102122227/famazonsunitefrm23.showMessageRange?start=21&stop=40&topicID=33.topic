&quot;It would seem that the amazons have had a terribly harsh winter so justly they are offlimits in our games.&quot;  He pauses for dramatic effect as well as to make a slight point.  &quot;I suggest a game of hunting in which the hunter becomes the hunter becomes the hunted perhaps?

Zeus fires a heavy lightning bolt at the spittle on the floor of Olympus, then glares at Poseidon.  &quot;It is written and so it is that many have attempted to overthrow the King of the Gods and have failed.
