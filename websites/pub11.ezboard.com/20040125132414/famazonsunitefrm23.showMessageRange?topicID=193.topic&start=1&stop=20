He sighed, resting his head in his hand. Winter was comming, dreaded, scorned winter. Such a beautiful season, it USED to be his favorite, until HE came along. Apollo shuddered at the very thought of HIM. The opprobrious god of wine, and revelry, thats right, his very own brother...Dionysus.<br>
<br>
The comming of Dionysus had taken Apollo by surprise all those years ago. Apollo remembered smirking, hearing of the birth of the little invalid child. Surely another demi-god would be lost and forgotten on Earth, destined to fend for himself.  Apollo remembered the day he found out Dionysus was half mortal. He sighed in releif, no one would come to threaten his attension, his beloved attension.<br>
<br>
But then Dionysus started making a ruccus down on Earth, a ruccus only a god could rustle up. Apollo was taken a back, but confident that Dionysus was destined to stay down there, in the mortal hell hole. But then Dionysus continued to make achievement after another, most of them minuscule, besides his invention, the sweet nectar that is wine.<br>
<br>
The stupid drink had taken the world by storm, spirits they called it, for they believed Dionysus's divine creation would bring up spirits that lie dormant within a mortals soul. Apollo rolled his eyes, had people forgotten how he taught them to heal their wounds? Had they forgotten how he had taught them to settle down and build cities? I mean he did bring about the Neolithic Age. But for the time being he would have to stand in the dark, the world was to drunk to remember who they really owed their debt to.<br>
<br>
And then the day came, Zeus decided it was high time for Dionysus to have his seat upon Olympus. Apollo was heartbroken on that day, Dionysus had done it, he had done the seemingly impossible, as he had done all those years ago, prooved himself worthy of a seat upon Olympus.  And then another fatal blow to his ego. Hestia gave up her seat!! The coveted seat next to Zeus. Now that was just rediculous. Hestia had promised him that seat, when she descided to retire to earth. But noOoOo. Dionysus had to come along and flub everything up. She thought &quot;thirteen was an unlucky number&quot;. Hmph, he'd show them all an unlucky number all right.<br>
<br>
Apollo remembered one winter he had decided to leave and go on one of his little escavations. He had made sure everything was in order on Delphi, the oracle, the play arena's, the camping grounds. All was in order. So he left. Only to come back to find maidens and people worshipping who else. DIONYSUS!! ON HIS ISLAND!!! Now that was a slap across the face. Dionysus had come and claimed Delphi his own from the months of December to April. And that was it, the official beggining of the legendary rivalry between Dionysus and Apollo. The world was basically split in half. It was Apollo, or Dionysus. Philosophers even split the human mind into two catagories, you were of Apollonistic mindset or of a Dionysustic mindset.<br>
<br>
So now to this day, after the winter solstice Dionysus is celebrated along side Apollo on Delphi, with plays. Drama's about creation and destruction. Comedy's and Tradjedy's. Apollo was sick of it. Who the Hades did Dionysus think he was? Parading up to Olympus and taking everything Apollo held near and dear. But Apollo knew something Dionysus didn't.<br>
<br>
No one really liked him. A smirk played its way onto Apollo's face. Atleast people liked him, or atleast put up with him. But Dionysus? Ha, he was just a little copy cat, trying to succeed  Apollo. Dionysus even claimed to be a patron of the arts and had constant escapades with the Muses. Dionysus even dared to claim that he was Zeus's favorite child, after Pallas Athena ofcourse. But Apollo knew this to be untrue. He liked to think of himself as a favorite, but whatever, it mattered not. He didn't care for Zeus that much anyway, and he was quite vocal about it. He was, Phoebus Apollo, The Creator, the Destroyer, the bringer of light, truth, knowledge, and all things divine. The most hellenistic of all the gods upon Olympus. And yet he felt threatened by Dionysus.<br>
<br>
Things were getting alittle to close for comfort to Apollo. But atleast the cult following of Dionysus has died down a bit, due to his sudden, unannounced and rather shameful dissapearance from the Olympic scene. Apollo sighed again, winter was approaching fast, so Apollo would have to take up residence of Delos until the large obnoxious following of Dionysus left his beloved island. Them and their orgy's and drunken revelry. Apollo found it all to be quite shameful. The uncultivated, obnoxious Dionysus...dreaded god of all things &quot;delicious&quot; as it was so often put. God of all things &quot;delicious&quot;...Apollo failed to even want to try and decifer what they ment by &quot;delicious&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Heathen...&quot; Apollo murmered as he got up from his throne and went to go busy himself.<br>

&quot;First and for most I would like to ask one question. Who are you? Secondly, what are you doing in my temple? And thirdy, What do you want?&quot;<br>
<br>
Apollo's bluntness was well known throughout Olympus, and this was no exception. Apollo crossed his arms over his chest tightly and awaited this...thing to answer his questions. Apollo shook the golden locks from his eyes and perked a brow.<br>
