 But Dawn's style of tracking Hercules was different than the other Amazons that had gathered in the tree tops, to watch, follow ad assist. Dawn had a history with Hercules.  As he stopped, the demonic tiger crouched behind a tree, its mysterious emeralds watching him. If he saw her, he wouldn't know the difference, he'd only think that some tiger was hoping to make him, her next meal. <br>
 Only one with the knowledge of Dawn could pin those emerald pools on her, and that tiger form. <br>

She was proud to have such loyal athelfi.<br>
<br>
She growled lightly looking down upon the pressence of Poseidon. These were her lands, and no male God was welcomed there without previous invitation, unless deemed so by Hera. And Aly doubted that Hera would allow Poseideon to enter lands that were not even of Olympian worship. <br>
<br>
Many amazons in her tribe were immortal, of Olympian decent and others, including Alysia. Aly had proved once before that her strength and the strength of her tribe exceeded that of Olympian stature to the male Gods, and Poseidon was tresspassing on Scynthian Terrirtory. Not a good choice for an Olympian God.<br>
<br>
Alysia nodded to Dawn, Sartha and Rishkae. Keeping her eyes on Odessa as well knowing she had already seen and sensed the unwelcome pressense. <br>
<br>
Alysia taught her amazons never to attack unless threatened, but Poseidon was on her lands, lands of the Atmah and the Ancients. He was a threat to their society.<br>
<br>
Speaking telepathically to her sisters she nodded.<br>
<br>
~Defend our lands if you must sisters, do not harm the Olympian unless provoked to do so. He may be questioned at a later time. Also, leave Hercules be. He shall be our welcomed guest this night.~<br>
<br>
Alysia smiled at Dawn seeing her tiger friend keeping an eye on Hercules. She also appreciated Rishkae and Sartha watching Odessa, her treasured grandaughter..<br>
<br>
<br>
Olympian Gods were not welcomed on Scynthian Lands. Poseidon would soon learn that if he had not before.<br>
<br>
Alysia stood still in the trees and just watched. She looked to her amazon sisters and held her hand letting them know not to attack unless given a signal. She was in no need to upset the Gods at this time, Hera and the Goddesses were in Alys favor, and she did not want to stir anymore trouble on Olympus. She looked to Dawn letting her assasin sister know that she had the right of way to defend Scynthia is Poseidon posed a direct threat, but no other amazons were in need at the moment.<br>

She wondered why the male would come to Scynthia? Was he that stupid? Apparently, he was. <br>
<br>
Odessa was blessed with being the mirror image of the Great Samsara, and Samsara's strong will, and ambition. Her aggresiveness was all she had toward the opposite sex. She wanted nothing to do with anyone but her athelfi's in the other tribes.<br>
<br>
She watched the other male, growling inaudibly, her hand near her dagger. &quot;I hate uninvited guests.&quot; She mumbled to herself.<br>

Mommy made me this way
Evil and hungry
I'm just a craving soul
Craving for your blood and death; M'Dear
Don't worry it won't hurt..
Just a dagger or two.. 
Crimson spilling onto my hands..
Running over the flesh to drip from my elbow
Scarring the black leather pants..
Mmmm its yummy
Don't worry I only strike once...
Don't bother to scream... they won't catch me
