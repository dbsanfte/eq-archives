'Just look at all the ants that need crushing. Such pritty little things...then i kill them.' Madmartigan started to chuckle, then it grew louder, then he was laughing, louder, then louder, then louder, then he stoped. His eyes were glowing dark blue and he tilted his head down a bit as an evil grin crossed his mouth. Then all of a sudden, he rose his head, eyes opening as wide as they could go, and thrust his hands outwards shouting to the village people.<br>

People stopped what they were doing to look at this person who had glowing eyes and a sword in his hand. Then, one by one they began to realize his intentions. Calls from all around the village were for the guards to come. A long row of 20 guards came and stood in Madmartigans way to the village. The commander stepped forwards and spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;We know what you came here to do!! And we will not let you. Men, ready weapons!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Madmartigan smerked as the order was given out. He looked at the man in front of him. &quot;So you want to play,&quot; He said, &quot;lets play.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the blink of an eye, Madmartigan brought up his sword and had sliced off the man's head. He looked to the row of what was now 19 guards, they were now heasitant and starting to fall back.

He swung the sword downwards and sliced the man down his cheast, spilling out his intestines. Madmartigan turned the blade in its path to peirce the man next to him's heart, all this as fast as lightning. He saw attacks made on him and he blocked and parried them all, sliceing and stabbing inbetween. When it was all over, Madmartigan stood alone, his sword had hit every time he had swung. Twenty lives were lost, twenty bodies lay at Mad's feet, and he smiled. He looked up and saw the villagers running around, trying to get away.<br>

Everyone who had lived in the village was now dead or dieing. He walked back to where he came to the village, straw huts burining red around him. He smiled. He walked on people, the ones who were still alive groaned and cryed out as he crushed skulls, ribcages, and broke arms and legs in his wake. He had his fun, but what was this, one person was standing, and she was in his way. Quickley he walked up to her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Have you anything to say before i kill you too little ant?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; Said the woman, &quot;You are a vile creature, and i shall kill you for what you have done.&quot;<br>
<br>
Madmartigan chukled as she spoke. &quot;Why thank you, your words are too kind.&quot;<br>
<br>
Madmartigan struck out with his hand and grasped her throat. &quot;I shall show you how vile i am.&quot; Madmartigan thrust his other hand out while the woman squirmed in his hand. His hand hit the center of her cheast and kept going. He dug his hand deep into her body, then he pulled it out, along with her heart. The woman looked at him in horror as she died, watching her heart beat its final times. and the man, who then took a bite out of it.<br>
<br>
Madmartigan droped the heart and the woman at the same time. Blood coated his whole body, and then he started to walk. Walked to somewhere elce, for the same reason that he had came to this village. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=hypnos>Hypnos </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 163<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(8/13/01 3:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=134.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=C:\WINDOWS\Desktop\Stuff\hypnos.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A village destroyed</span><hr size=1> ***Looked in dismay at the village and its dead or dieing...

Hmm should have left you to drown in my footprint little one.  And funny you talk to me as if I have been forgotten by my own people.  No, it is not I that will stand in your way.  Not now.  Mayhaps not later.  You are not a threat to me or to my home, but one woman will beat you Dymaster.  Your arrogance will be your downfall.  it always was.&lt;&lt;<br>

Just standing and waiting. Waiting for his adversary to come. He stood motionless, except for his hair blowing in the wind. Dymastar looked on and wondered, could this Sheyala realy defeat this body? It didnt seem possible. But there was something inside of him that told him that he would fight with more than just Sheyala in this battle. Something also told him that he may even loose. Thunder rolled through the blackening sky, as Dymastar waited. Waited for his adversary. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/usheyala.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sheyala</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 264<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(8/17/01 9:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=134.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://geocities.com/Tokyo/Pagoda/8446/mononoke_poster.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Revenge from her past</span><hr size=1> ::Fianlly Sheyala arrived at the last destroyed village and knew the man standing where he was.

She also knew that it meant everything to her.::<br>
<br>
&quot;So you are the one I sensed from so far away.  hmpf I warned Madmartigan not to cross me... But that was directed towards you... Dymaster.&quot;<br>

::She took a defensive stance knowing what was coming.  she dug her feet into the ground, dirt piling on either side of her boots.  Her braid had come loose during her furious ride so all that held her unruly hair backwas a small leather thong rope that ran around her forehead-and that barely seemed to help.::<br>
