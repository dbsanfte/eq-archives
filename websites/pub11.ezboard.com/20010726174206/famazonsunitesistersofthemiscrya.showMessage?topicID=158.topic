She had her horse, Zephyur, by the reins as she aimlessly roamed, heading in a round-about way back to her hut.  Her time outside made it impossible to keep warm, and her layers of furs made it impossible to move.  Wearing beneath her two fur cloaks a pair of leather breeches and a long sleeve shirt, she felt completely restricted.<br>

As she walked on, looking like an Eskimo and completely lost in though, she didn't notice the bard as she did her laundry.  Nicodema tumbled head-first over the kneeling Gabrielle.::<br>

A soft sigh escaped her lips as her mood changed slightly and abruptly. &quot;Gotta get this stuff ready...I'm off to Rome...&quot; The last word was spoken reluctantly.<br>
