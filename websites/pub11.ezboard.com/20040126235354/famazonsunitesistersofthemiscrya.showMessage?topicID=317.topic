She walked to her window and opened the shutter, but the color of teh sky and position of the moon, she could tell it was atleast an hour before sunrise. The perfect time to get a start on the long day that was ahead of her. Quickly she changed from her long knitted nightdress into a pair of woolen pants and a woolen shirt, she slid her knitted socked feet into her winter boots then grabbed her large bag. She began to ready her supplies that she put aside the night before. Her large bladder of water was attached to the bag. She threw a few pairs of socks into the bag, along with a large amount of dried meats and fruits. She grabbed her shapening stone and placed it as well into the bag, along with the other neccesities she needed for the hunt. She tied the bag closed and grabbed her cape. She put it around her shoulders and tied it closed. Grabbing her crossbow and quiver of arrows, she secured them to her. And looked around. The previous night, she explained to her grey wolf Lukoi that he was to stay put, he was getting old, and it worried the princess sometimes that he was out in the cold. Afterall Lukoi was one of the last of the wolves she had grown up with, he being only a pup when they found her. Making sure she had everything, then she headed out the door into the fresh snow. The light from the moon cast an erie blue glow against the starch whitness of the snow. She moved quietly in the snow amoung the trees. Every so often hearing a call from one of the guards in the trees that kept there eyes out for the tribe. She would send them a greeting in return. A smile spread on her lips as she came upon Varia's cabin. She walked up the porch and banged loudly on the door waiting for her to answer.....~ <p>         ~~* DeL *~~

She was beginning to be more awake now, since it was getting later. She was still embarrassed about the guinea pig pajamas, but hey, everyone has their things, right? hehe.<br>
<br>
She did a flip around and landed in front of DeL, then laughed and ducked away, resuming her place behind her with a grin. <p><html> <font face="Signet Roundhand ATT"> Varia Angelina Avande </font> </html></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamazondelerium.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amazon DeLerium</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amazon</span><br>  Posts: 218<br> <font color=#993300>(1/12/02 1:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=317.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/deleriuml9/images/del2.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: In the trees</span><hr size=1> ~DeL smirked as the young amazon jumped back and forth, he rmovements reminding DeL of a money she once saw farther south once. She shook her head. As she jumped from tree to tree, she picked up the scent of a bear, scanning around, she found the large black bear she heard was tearing up villages and campsites. That grin began to form on her lips as she motioned for Varia to go three trees down on the other side of the bear. DeL then turned and crouched down, she took a bow from its quiver and strung it, aiming at the magnificant beast, she let loose the arrow, it struck the bear in the neck where she was aiming for, flawlessly, then looked to Varia as she made it to the other tree. The bear as still moving and DeL wanted it out of pain as quickly as possible, she waited for Varia to end it's suffering.~ <p>         ~~* DeL *~~
