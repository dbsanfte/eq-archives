The Amazon stood tall and stately, with her Aunt at her side.<br>
<br>
The Queen's mask was passed over to Teygra last night and now it was time fr the tribe to officially recognize Teygra as their new Queen.<br>
<br>
Ardyn wore her ceremonial amazon leathers, which consisted of: a navy blue leather battle skirt that slit up both sides revealing her thighs, a matching bra-like halter top that was outlined with golden intracate Ancient Amazon symbols, a braid of brown leather wrapped around her forehead with a golden center piece that dangled just above her nose.<br>
<br>
Her top was decored and fringed in white owl feathers, She was ready to step down and take control of her own Clan in Eire.<br>
<br>
A slender yet built arm raised as silence blanketed the crowd. The arm went around her back and was clasped by the opposite hand. <br>
<br>
&quot;A Queen's reign rises and falls like the sun. As the sun set last night, so has my time here as your Queen. I feel honoured that I could command you and protect you, and I feel forever changed because you have taught me many things that can not be taught in schools. But As the sun rises, it rises with a New Queen, my Aunt, Teygra O'the Wind.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Amazons salute Ardyn-Tyger and she gracefull and proudly returns the salute. She hands over the mask of the Queen to her Aunt with a smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know you shall serve them well, dear Aunt.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ardyn turned back to the cheering crowd, and stepped down the ivory stairs, she stood infront of the crowd looking up at her Aunt, smiling ever so proud.<br>
<br>
&quot;Speech!&quot;, the crowd demanded from the new Queen.  <p>¤Ardyn-Tyger O'the Wind¤<br>

She was clad, also, in her ceremonial leathers.  Her dress consisted of leathers; dyed a dark red color which stood for womanhood, maternity, and the mother aspect of the Goddess; which wrapped around her back tying in the front around her bust like a corset.  Dark black leather tied her top together at the top, about an inch below her cleavage line.  A matching color leather wrapped around her hips, ending at her mid thigh.  These clothes were specially made, for if worn by an average amazon, her bottom would've been closer to being a top.  Wooden sandals laid flat below her tiny feet, tied on by a black leather which wrapped around her calves, ending at her knees.<br>
<br>
Her sea blue occulars, lit up by the flame of the candles next to her, gazed along the crowd, staring at each individual which stood still and silenced as Ardyn spoke.  As she moved her head, her long braid of black and white locks wrapped by a long black sting of leather which started at the beginning and was wrapped all the way down to the end of the braid moved from her shoulder and onto her back.<br>
<br>
When her niece handed her the mask, she took it greatfully.  With that she stood to her feet as all the amazons demanded a speech from her.  Once she was on her feet, she took one step closer to the edge of the platform which they stood.  She took one more unsure look along the crowd before bringing her hand up to silence them.<br>
<br>
A loud cheer rolled through the crowd as the hand meant that she was about to make one.  As they cheered a smile fell across her face as her maternal instinct kicked in and influenced her about what to make the speech on.<br>
<br>
&quot;My athelfi, my moro!  It brings me great joy to be Vasillissa of your tribe!  As a mother does for her young, I shall nurture, I shall care, I shall raise you and your children!  My athelfi, to me, you are my children, and I shall love you as much as I love my own!<br>
<br>
Now, I may not rule like your old Queen, Ardyn, and that is because no one can!  Ardyn-Tyger is a great ruler and that is why she must go and tend to our O'the Wind Clan!  She must bring what triumph she brought to you over to them!  Do no fret, for I am sure she will visit this tribe, if not I will have to go and drag her back here!  For she may depart to her clan, but in her heart she will never leave this land.  For once an amazon, always an amazon!&quot;<br>
<br>
The crowd cheered at her words, another loud roar exploded from the crowd as she turned towards her little niece for more instructions. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">eygra O'the W¡nd<br>

The Amazon took her sword from it scabbard and raised it to the sky.<br>
<br>
&quot;Amazons, raise your weapons, and arms to the new Queen! Honour her as you would any other Queen!&quot;<br>
<br>
The tribe on command and unseaths their weapons, rases them skyward.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail Queen Teygra!&quot;<br>
<br>
And as Ardyn started chanting this, the tribe followed all in sync with each other, praising their new leader.<br>
<br>
Ardyn sheathed her sword and walked up to her Aunt's side. She wrapped her arm around Tey's shoulder. Her other arm pointed out to the crowd roaring below.<br>
<br>
&quot;They honour you, Queen Teygra. Announce your goals to the tribe, command silence and give your oath to them...They are your children, give them guidance...&quot; Ardyn took a step back and watched her Aunt take control with a smile on her lips.  <p>¤Ardyn-Tyger O'the Wind¤<br>

She began to softly clap her hands and make an odd &quot;eee&quot; noise of excitement as a child would.<br>
<br>
When Ardyn put her arm around her, she gave her neice a quick hug and returned to look upon her new tribe.  She was now an Amazon Queen as well as Goddess!<br>
<br>
She raised her little pale hand once again to the crowd and silenced them.  With the raise of her arm she closed her eyes slightly and openned them when she returned her arm to her side.<br>
<br>
&quot;My athelfi, there is nothing to change in this tribe goal wise sense you old Queen Ardyn handed you over to me in perfect condition.  The only command I give you now is something I have been waiting to do sense we began this celebration; You may Feast!!<br>
<br>
Once everyone has seated with food and red wyne I will announce to make a toast to Ardyn's departure to our old Lands of Eire that it will be a joyous and wonderful one.  So make sure to grab you a goblet of Red Wyne.&quot; <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">eygra O'the W¡nd<br>
