&quot;Amazons....&quot; she lifted her eyes to the proud warriors before her. &quot;We ride!&quot;   That was it....there was no time for any speaches.  Each amazon knew her calling and why she was here.  To each it would be a battle with her athelfi..and a battle within.   Hipp was wise enough to understand that.  <br>
Pulling her the reigns of her mare, she turned to ride towards the Northern Lands.

A woman who had quietly returned to those who had given her a home.  Hippolyte had met with Arahuta before she rode off with her small army of amazons.  She had made Ara promise to stay and watch over Themiscrya and those who remained.   Arahuta made the promise, and knew it meant she may have to break one she had made to herself.  That was to never kill.   She looked over the city of amazons and sighed.  And turned and walked to the smithy's barn.  There Hippolyte told her to chose any weapons.  Something that she would feel comfortable with and ready.  There were still warriors left in the city.  And they would stand with Ara in case of attack.  <br>
<br>
Ara stepped into the smithy and looked over the weapons.  Two slender long curved swords caught her eyes.  She had fought with the very same type in Rome as a slave.  Arahuta walked over and slide them from their places in the wooden wall then stepped back.  Instantly, like an old habit unable to be rid of, she began to move and twist with the swords in hand.  Fighting off the invisible enemy.  Then with a nod, she knew she was ready.  <br>
<br>
Arahuta went to her hut and fashioned two scabbards for the long thin blades.   Once finished she walked out of her hut and sat on the steps.  Listening for the call of the cities gaurdians, for anything. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualcippe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alcippe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#993300>(8/21/01 6:16:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=271.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Following</span><hr size=1> She sat unsure, watching her queen and listening to her words.
