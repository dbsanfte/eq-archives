She does not even notice his presence as she takes tiny bites of her meal. She swallows sadly as they feel like hard, tense lumps going down her throat. She stares blankly at her food and her mind takes on an emotional rollercoaster. She's very anxious for the coach to arrive to take her to her dear mother, yet she cannot bear to leave her beloved Hades behind. After finishing a little of over half her meal, she turns to the servant at her side who whispers of the carriage's arrival at the palace gate. She stands and looks at Hades solemnly:: <br><br>The carriage is here. We must leave now.<br><br>::Without even waiting for Hades, Persephone turns and leaves the hall quickly. Her snow white silk toga and white, long, cloak like veil sway and billow gracefully with her walk. The diamonds in her bracelets, necklace, wedding band, ad as well as the subtle ones in her pinned up curly hair twinkle and sparkle brilliantly in the bright yet dark sunlight of the morning. When she gets to the carriage, she takes the hand of the driver and gently steps inside. After she makes herself comfortable inside gold interior painted carriage on plush rosed colored velvet cushion, she leans her head out the window::<br><br>Do not leave just yet driver. My husband will be coming shortly to escort me to my mother. ::As she puts her head back in, the driver looks straight ahead and gulps hard at the thought of seeing the great lord Hades:<br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uixlordhadesxi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>IX Lord Hades XI</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 176<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(4/1/02 4:34:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=242.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> A solemn goodbye...</span><hr size=1> ::Hades slowly stood up as he did not eat much of his food, save a few bites.
