Pulling back on the reigns of his chariot he brings his steeds to a halt. The sea begins to churn violently and his steeds neigh loudly and run off. Poseidon falls out of the chariot because of the sudden running of the steeds. He hits the soft sand on the ground hard and gravel flies up all around him making the water cloudy. He gets up quickly to his feet and regains his composure. He is now surrounded all over by more than 2 dozen giant squids from the deepest part of the seas. Before he can move to retrieve his trident which has fallen on the ground 30 feet from where he stands more than 20 tentacles grab and hold tight to all of his limbs. Unable to move a muscle, Poseidon watches as the other squids take away his trident. Then he is thrown back hard into a granite hill with such force that it collapses. Struggling to look up from the debris around him Poseidon watches as the squids swim away down into a huge crevice which is in the sea bed. As he looks the water around him turns crimson with his blood and he slowly loses conciosness.:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uixlordhadesxi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>IX Lord Hades XI</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(5/2/01 12:56:08 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stolen Trident</span><hr size=1> As Poseidon lie there bleeding and unconscious, the ground beneath him slowly began to rumble and shake, till finally a small rift was split wide open.  Hades himself emerged from the rift with a bit of dark anger in his eyes.  For this, he remained inside of an air bubble.  He then knelt beside his unconcious brother who was lying there and picked him up.  Hades, then as quickly as he appeared, returned to the rift, sealing it up behind him as if it never was.  <br>
<br>
Once in the Underworld, Hades immediatly took his brothers body to this throne room and set it on a small flat marble bed.  He then took his place upon his throne as sat, awaiting his brother to awaken.  While he did not necessarily always agree with or even at times like his brother, he still felt oblidged to watch out for him.  What angered him greatly was that someone, or something would have such utter contempt and disregard for an Olympian god as to beat on him and leave him in such a condition.  He took it as not only a sign of disrespect to his brother, but to one unto himself.  Therefore, he could not leave him lying on the bottom of the ocean floor, bloody and beaten.  <br>

&quot;I was doing my daily rounds of patroling the seas when of a sudden I'm attacked by these huge squids. But these squids were not from my domain... of course they couldn't be because none who know of me have the heart to attack me. Anyway my steeds paniced and took flight and being off guard I fell from my chariot and my trident fell in the opposite direction. After being brutally attacked the squids made off with my trident in the huge crevace that was in the sea floor. While I was unconcious I had many dreams and thoughts which came to me. Who would attack me and why? This I thought over and over. Then I realized someone must want to get back at me maybe not because I did something to them but because I was close to this someone who did them wrong. I know of a being who has kept a grudge not on me but on my brother Zeus. Also he must be a river god to have control over these creatures of the deep.Now with my trident he feels he has the power to do Zeus harm. This god is Asopus, who was humiliated when trying to save his daugter, Aegina from Zeus, was attacked and driven off by lord Zeus' thunder bolts. Now he seeks his revenge on my brother. But he has crossed me and must pay for his crimes. I myself will send him to tartarus even though he be a god.&quot; <br>
