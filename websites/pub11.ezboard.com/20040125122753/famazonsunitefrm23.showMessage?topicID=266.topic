Fall would be coming soon and she had to enjoy everything as much as she could before she returned to the Underworld. Looking around she looks at her personal fine work and smiles. Looking up ahead, she spots a village. Sine her mother always had her plainly dress, she saw no need to disguise herself::<br>
<br>
::As she walks through the quaint but cute village, she spots a temple of Aphrodite. Persephone runs to it and walks in anxiously to meet her dear friend. But alas the temple is completely empty. She smiles and skips over to her throne and places some red and orange roses on it as a sort of warning of the coming Autumn. Sort of like a yellow light. Walking around she finds herself in the kitchen:: I am sure Aphrodite would not mind if I helped myself to a beverage, I am completely parched! ::looking through a pantry, she finds a vile of a red, cold fluid in the back. Smiling, she removes the glass cork and takes a good long swig of it. Swallowing hard, she snatches the vile away from her mouth, snaps the cork back on and puts the cork back on looking at it with disgust::<br>
<br>
::Turning to leave, Persephone stops. Her legs knees and she gribs the edge of a chair as she is overcome with a great lust and desire. Looking around she grabs a note and writes an urgent letter of emergency to Hades requesting his help at in her Olympian suite at once. She knew that he would come quickly if the letter came to him from nowhere and if her pearl bracelet that still laid in his pocket turned black, which it did.<br>
<br>
::A small beige portal appears and Persephone binds her scroll with her personally seal and throws it into the portal. The portal goes straight to the Underworld and drops in into Hades' lap, where ever he is. Persephone then grips the chair with both hands and gives out a small moan and dissappears to her private suite on Olympus:: <p>*~* Persephone...Queen of the Underworld.. faithful wife to Hades... princesss goddess of the Spring*~*</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uixlordhadesxi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>IX Lord Hades XI</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 193<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(8/14/02 1:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=266.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> To the Rescue?</span><hr size=1> ::Hades sat upon his throne in the Underworld as per usual when the message dropped right onto his lap.

At first the God was alone with a few of his fellow Olympians until they headed off then he saw Persephone skirt by in a sort of fanatical state. The sea god paid this no mind but he wondered at the behavior exhibited in Persephone since it did not seem to fit her character.<br>
<br>
Olympus was no sooner filled with an almost unknown presence and Poseidon could easily deduce that it was Hades. Who else had such raw power to be carrying around but Hades! <br>
<br>
Now things were very questionable. Hades on Olympus soon after Persephone had come in a frenzie. The sea god got up from his seat at an empty but food filled table and walked to the chambers of the immortals. When he got there the sound of erotic goings on could be dimly heard from someplace which Poseidon figured was where Hades and Persephone were. Not wanting to be an intruder of privacy the God waited near to the quarters of Persephone. A cool breeze blew at the curtains oh her open windows and door as with many another homes there. <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uixlordhadesxi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>IX Lord Hades XI</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 196<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(8/24/02 7:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=266.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Relentless</span><hr size=1> ::Hades put his hand on Persephone's stomach:: &quot;What is the matter?&quot;  <br>
