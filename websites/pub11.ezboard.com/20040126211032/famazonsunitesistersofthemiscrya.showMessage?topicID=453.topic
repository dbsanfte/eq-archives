Not that the sun actually bothered her, she was rather fond of it on some days. People believed in the most silliest garbage.<br>
<br>
Mora came up from her deep cavern where she dwelled, taking in a breath of fresh air. She had yet to welcome back Hippolyte. She had met the Queen perhaps a few handfull of times, but remembered her well. <br>
<br>
Mora's black locks were pinned up on her head, kind of sloppily, but snazzy none the less for the 5 foot demoness. She wore an almost sheer black toga. Something she picked up on her travellels through Rome on her way to Themiscrya. As she walked, her booted feet sank into the melting snow, giving the sign that winter was just about at its end.<br>
<br>
Mora wasn't sure if she ever met Solari either. She knew De Lerium rather well, but that was whole other story. As she walked, she took in the nice day, her grey eyes flashing on this and that. She stopped for a while and watched some of the younger amazons in traning, then headed out to the village to meet the Queens. <p><center><img border=0 src="http://www.feebleminds-gifs.com/woman-warrior.gif" /></center>

As she left the garden, she bumped into a stranger she had never seen before. <br>

As she walked, she was bumped into and stumbled a bit, an angry glare sat in her grey eyes for just a second, or , atleast until she saw who it was. <br>
<br>
Brushing a strand of black hair from her eye she bowed to the Queen.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well met Queen Solari. I am Moranna, High Priestess of Eris, and do not worry about bumping into me, I get bumped arond alot sometimes...&quot;  ~grins~ <br>

Her eyes travelled over Solari, remembering every bit of the Queen.

Her head tilted and she listened to something only she could hear, perhaps it was someone in trouble, perhaps it was a call from her home, or perhaps it was just the voices in her head again plotting.

Solari noticed that she was nearly a foot taller than the high priestess and smiled very softly. Being taller than most amazons, Solari sometimes intimidated others, not meaning to, which was one reason why she was so friendly..but it seemed that the high priestess wasn't one to be intimidated. <br>

&quot;It is nice to see you again Hippolyte. It has been a long time since I have been in your company. I do assure you though, there will be no slaves in your lands. I know your feelings on those things.&quot;<br>

&quot;I have set up shop quite nicely here. Vasilissa De'Lerium has given me full run of one of the deeper caves that are scattered around here. I have made it home, it is quite comfy actually...How about you Vasilissa, How has it been going for you? All well I do hope.&quot; <p><center><img border=0 src="http://www.feebleminds-gifs.com/woman-warrior.gif" /></center>
