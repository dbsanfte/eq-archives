II Zelia II: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp _Continued Board SL_<br>
<br>
II Zelia II: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ::Zelia looks at Varia:: Thats your problem,Varia. You always<br>
think theres a higher power at work,out to get you or me,you can't see a good<br>
deal when it's poking you in the nose. <br>
II Zelia II: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ::She steps away from Varia,and walks toward Goruka::<br>
Alright,lets do this.<br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Varia slammed her fist into the nearest tree, fuming flippin<br>
mad. She had not been that mad in quite a long time... other than the thing<br>
with her sister, she didn't know if she had EVER been that mad, actually.<br>
&lt;Goruka&gt; ::Still holding that friendly smile,he looks from<br>
Zelia to Varia.::<br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ~Don't come crying to me,~ Varia said coldly and deliberately,<br>
and walked away.<br>
II Zelia II: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ::Looks behind her at Varia,sighs,and utters:: A little support<br>
couldnt kill you.<br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She kept walking, tears streaming down her face, but she<br>
didn't look back. Didn't want either of them to see her cry. Her heart had<br>
just been torn in two.<br>
II Zelia II: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ::Hope Var didnt hurt her hand,when she hit the tree,but<br>
now,now was the time to accept the gift Goruka offered. She returns her<br>
attention to Goruka:: <br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Saph appeared in a flash of blue light. Rituals and evilness<br>
were always interesting to her... couldn't miss this one. She just sat in a<br>
nearby tree and watched.<br>
&lt;Goruka&gt; ::Steps beside Zelia,and slips an arm around her<br>
shoulders:: Don't worry,she loves you,and she'll get over it once she sees<br>
how happy you will be.<br>
II Zelia II: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ::Even as Sapphire appeared,the power Goruka was using screwed<br>
up all her sences,she couldnt even sence a god if they were kicking her in<br>
the arse. She glances at Gorukas arm around her shoulder,strange,that didnt<br>
bother her.:: <br>
II Zelia II: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I trust your words,Goruka<br>
&lt;Goruka&gt; Come then,lets begin. ::He leads her away from the<br>
amazon boundries of chadesia,and to an open field.::<br>
&lt;Goruka&gt; ::Once at the field,he steps away from Zelia,and<br>
begins gathering the things he will need::<br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Varia went back to their hut... knowing she was losing her<br>
love... the other half of her soul. She buried her head in her pillow, not<br>
knowing what much there was to live for anymore.<br>
II Zelia II: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ::Watches him curiously. How totally blind she was. To bad she<br>
didnt know it.::<br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Anubus, her wolf pup, came and cuddled with his momma. Var<br>
grabbed him up and cried into his warm comforting fur.<br>
&lt;Goruka&gt; ::After some moments,he built a fire,circled with 6<br>
black stones,which he found lucky to find in this area. He then walks over to<br>
Zel and gently takes her arm and leads her to the fire:: Stand within the<br>
circle of stones.<br>
II Zelia II: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ::Be'd led to the fire,she steps inside the circle of stones.::<br>
Is this going to hurt?<br>
&lt;Goruka&gt; Not at all,you will feel a tad light headed,but it<br>
will be for a short moment.<br>
II Zelia II: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ::Nods:: Okay,then i'm ready.<br>
&lt;Goruka&gt; Alright then...::He slips off his coat,and sets it<br>
away from them,then walks over and stands infront of Zelia::<br>
II Zelia II: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ::Is a little nervous,but beleives this is for the best::<br>
&lt;Goruka&gt; ::From his bag of many things,he grabs out a small<br>
metalic charm::<br>
&lt;Goruka&gt; ::Had performed this ritual once before,but then,he<br>
had 3 shamanesses there to help,but he knew he could do this on his own. In<br>
his other hand,he grabs out a small hand full of the black dust from his<br>
bag::<br>
&lt;Goruka&gt; ::Begins to walk around the circle of stone,staying on<br>
the outside. He chants in a strange diolect,and sprinkles the black dust<br>
around the circle of stone,then throwing the rest into the fire,causing the<br>
flames to roar up,and become black::<br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ~Jaiden appeared beside Sapphire, for the simple reason that<br>
rituals turned her on. Well, pretty much EVERYTHING turned her on, so that<br>
wasn't saying much. But anyways, she appeared to watch and enjoy.~<br>
II Zelia II: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ::Closes her eyes,in a trance like state::<br>
&lt;Goruka&gt; ::Holding the metalic charm still in his one hand,he<br>
now reaches behind his back,and pulls out a ritual dagger from his belt.::<br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ~Jai licked her lips as the dagger got pulled from the cute<br>
guy's belt~<br>
&lt;Goruka&gt; ::Stands infront of Zelia now,he places the metalic<br>
charm against her forehead,then releases the charm,and it like magic,or has<br>
some kind of sticky substance on it,allows the charm to stay put::<br>
&lt;Goruka&gt; ::Then takes Zelias left hand,and places the blade<br>
against her flesh:: Dark Lord,with your pressence,I take the sacrifice of<br>
Zelia,the second destroyers blood,and with the charm,let her Good essence be<br>
flushed from her soul<br>
&lt;Goruka&gt; ::Slices open Zelias palm,then steps back and lets her<br>
bleed::<br>
&lt;Goruka&gt; ::As Zelia bleeds,her good essence will begins to<br>
bleed into the charm::<br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ~Jaiden heard those words and her eyes widened~<br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ~she jumped out of the tree and snatched the charm from<br>
Zelia's skin~<br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Miss Zelia, get up! ~she yelled~sex may have been her forte,<br>
but loyalty was slipped in there somewhere, and she felt loyal to Varia, so<br>
she woudln't let this happen~<br>
II Zelia II: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ::Her palm begins to bleed,and as she bled,her goodness starts<br>
to drain into the charm. BUT! Not too much goodness was lost,since Jaiden<br>
took the charm || lol ||. Zelia's eyes shoot wide open,and she falls to her<br>
knees,clutching her<br>
II Zelia II: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp head::<br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ~she lunged for Goruka, grabbing him around the neck and<br>
squeezing tightly~<br>
&lt;Goruka&gt; ::Looks wide eyes at Jaiden:: What do you think you<br>
are doing?<br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Defending my Queen's Rite of Caste! ~she yelled through<br>
clenched teeth~<br>
II Zelia II: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ::Looks up at Goruka and Jaiden. She stands up slowly::<br>
II Zelia II: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ::Has a spliting headache,but now she knew something was<br>
wrong.:: What's going on?<br>
&lt;Goruka&gt; Release me foul woman!<br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You betrayed your wife, that's what's going on! ~Jaiden said<br>
angrily to Zelia~ <br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp O.O<br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Get out of here, now! Before this @#%$ kills your soul!<br>
&lt;Goruka<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> :Was not much of a fighter,but he could defend himself<br>
against anyone with his magic. And so he slips a hand into his bag,and pulls<br>
out a dark green powder,which he blows into Jaidens face,creating a fit of<br>
something,your choice::<br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ~she brought one fist down on Goruka's skull, knocking him<br>
unconscious, then kicked him in the b*lls~<br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ~then had a fit of laughter~<br>
&lt;Goruka&gt; ::Was knocked unconcious,and fell in a heap::<br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ~Sapphire just kind of went &quot;wha??&quot;~not being too quick today~<br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ~then seeing Jaiden had it under control, she vanished~<br>
II Zelia II: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ::Rubs her head:: He was going to help me.....Or so I thought.<br>
::She sighed,and stepped out of the circle of stones::<br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ~she rolled around laughing for a few minutes until the spell<br>
wore off, then she got to her feet, quite angry about the damn laughing, and<br>
stalked off~<br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ~didn't stalk off just yet~<br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You'd better go and try to fix your wife's broken heart, ~she<br>
said to Zelia, and then she stalked off~lol~<br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ~meanwhile....~<br>
II Zelia II: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ::Looks down at Goruka,then walks off,headed back to Chadesia::<br>
Varia Avande: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ~Varia has made herself sick from crying and is now lying<br>
passed out on her bed, cuddling tight to Anubus~<br>
