Even the light from the moon, could not show his features. As he appraoched the gates of the City of Themiscrya, he held out a scroll to one of the guards standing there.::<br>
&quot;Please, I mean no harm, not do I intend to stay anywhere near the amazon lands ot territory, but I have this scroll that must be given to the one called Solari, it is of dire importance.&quot;<br>
::With suspisious eyes, the guard took the scroll and unravelled it, taking a quick peak of the letter, her eyes widened as she made a call that sounded like a hawk. At once, another amazon came out of the trees. They spoke together in a language the messanger did not understand. Then, the one who came from the tree took the scroll and ran into the darkness twoards the City. The one who first accepted the scroll, turned to the male figure.::<br>
&quot;You have safe passage through our territory If captured, tell them to bring you here where I will vouge for you.&quot;<br>
::The male nodded and quickly went off into the deep dark forest. As he walked, he heard footsteps following him. He walked faster.::<br>
<br>
::Miklia the messanger ran as quick as her feet could bring her to the hut of Solari. On her way she dodged tree branches, small animals, tree stumps, rock, and anything else that might stop her, or make her fall. Miklia could run through these forests with her eyes closed if need be. Once at the hut, she knocked hard on the door, her breathing deep, she then pushed the door open, spotted Solari and walked over to her.::<br>
&quot;Please excuse the intrusion your highness, but I thought this would be of great importance to you.&quot;<br>
::She held out the scroll, as Solari opened it, she saw the words.::<br>
-------------------------------------------------<br>
To the amazon Solari.<br>
Years ago we recieved a woman who claimed to come from the City of Themsicrya. She had been kidnapped one night from the forests within the amazon territory. I am writing to let you know, that she is still very much alive and in Rome. I befriended this woman and she taught me many wonderfull things about women, and how to treat them like people, not wontom objects. It is because of her, that I have met my own wife. The person Marcius, who owns her, is not a pleasant person, he is more barbaric them I thought the amazons to be at first. I am risking my own life by writing this letter and bringing it to you. Please, help Deianeria, she must escape this tyrant before it is too late for her. Her spirit is allready crushed, let her life not be wasted.<br>
Signed:<br>
A friend of Deianeria<br>
---------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
::As the male headed to the boarder of the lands, he still heard footfalls behind him, spinning around, he looked into the darkness, and couldn't see a thing.::<br>
&quot;I have passage through the forest by the Guards of Themsicrya, leave me be.&quot;<br>
:: He yelled into the darkness, but that would be the last thing he would do, as soon as he turned back around, an arrow pierced through his neck, he fell to the floor, dead.::<br>

As she read the scroll, she nearly fainted upon the sight of the words. Her hands began to shake, thankful that she was sitting down, she looked up at the guard.<br>
 &quot;Who gave you this?&quot; She asked, her vioce shakey. &quot;Is the messanger still here?&quot; <br>
<br>
Solari's vioce was fading in and out faster than what she thought as the excitement and joyfullness took over. For all these years, she had thought that Deianeria was dead. No one had found her body when she disappeared. That was the day that Solari's heart was lost. She had never mentioned her wife much before this time, simply for the fact that she loved her beyond all measure. She was thankful the day the gods brought her to the village tavern and angry the day she mourned. The thought of raising their daughters alone echoed everyday in Solari's heart. <br>
 But this scroll gave her the answer she had been seeking all along. She read the scroll over and over again, letting each letter sink into her mind. She took out another scroll, writing down some information on it, then placing it inside her pouch. <br>
She looked to the guard once more, thinking of what she was going to do. <br>
 &quot;Please, saddle my horse and have her ready in one hours' time. I will be leaving.&quot; She said standing up. Solari dismissed the guard and began packing a few things for her trip. <br>
<br>
Solari  very rarey left without telling anyone of her whereabouts, but this was of the upmost importance. She left the scroll sent by the messanger on her table, placked a small bag of food and clothing, then walked into her storeroom and picked out her best weapons. Once selecting the weapons and packing them, she placed her cloak on and made sure she was well armed with daggers and her sword. She walked over to where her daughters were sleeping and woke Alkaria up. <br>
&quot;Alkaria, I have to go. I was just given word that Deianeria is alive.&quot; She said softly as her daughter sat up. <br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot; Alkaira asked sleepily. &quot;Mother is alive?&quot; She rubbed her eyes to wake up.<br>
<br>
&quot;It seems that way.&quot; Solari ansered. &quot;I am going to Rome to find her and bring her back. I need you to take care of Megan until I return. If you want, got to your aunt Del's or Hippolyta's and stay there.&quot; She leaned down and kissed her daughter on the forehead. &quot;I shall return as quickly as I can.&quot;<br>
<br>
Solari stood and walked out of her hut quietly. It was late and the village was sleeping. She knew that some would be aware of her leaving and would go to inform Del and Hippolyta. But she didnt care at this moment. Solari was on a mission. <br>
As she saw her mother ride off into the darkness, Alkaria walked over to the weapons store room and saw the weapons that were missing. She knew that her mother meant buisness. The Labrys axe was missing, as was the bow set fromArtemis. She turned to look out the window again, saw the scroll lying on the table, and walked over to read it. She knew that Del and Hippolyta needed to know this. They were the closest to her mother. Alkaria got dressed and ran out of the hut, carrying the scroll to Del's hut. She knocked on the door, calling out to her aunt.<br>

She handed to scroll to her. Alkaira loved both her mothers, but knew that this was going to be tough on Solari. She was that way because she was the first born of the union. <br>
&quot;Mom took the Labrys and the bow set that Artemis gave her. She is going to kill someone.&quot; She said with a worried voice. Sure, her mother was a war queen and a exceptionally skilled warrior...but Solari was heading into the heart of men and Rome. A place that held bad memories for her mother. <br>
&quot;What do you think we should do? Mom would get mad if we were to try and stop her.

&quot;Lets not get all crazy here...First off, Solari, being of Athena's blood, cannot die...So if caught, they cannot execute her, and Gods help them if they try.&quot;<br>

Thoughts of her last visit there flooded her mind and feelings for her wife filled her heart. The wind from the ride stung here eyes and caused her to tear up. She had cursed herself when Deianeria went missing and they could not find her, thinking that she was dead. She felt her world collaspe under her. Now, word had been sent that she was alive. What would Deianeria think of her now? Why did she wait so long to send word of her whereabouts? Would the love they had still be there? These thoughts ran thru her mind as she raced the mare along the dirt path. <br>
 The visit to Rome the first time also rang thru her mind. Her capture and placement in the gladiator arena for enjoyment of the people. She had to kill in order to survive. Not that she was afraid of killing, but just for sport was senseless, even to an amazon. Some of whom were also forced to kill or be killed in the arena. Solari had made many friends among different amazons that had been captured. Some of which had to die by her own hand in order to live. But there was always a secret code among amazons, that if one should die by another amazon's sword, then it will be a fine death...one that would ensure their travel into the afterlife safely. <br>
 Her mare began to stretch out and cover the ground in faster strides it seemed. The road to Rome was long and tiring. Solari wanted to cover as much distance as possible before stopping. <br>

The word itself made her sick to her stoamch, not that she hated men, but to force on into martial vows was a sign of sickness in a person. She felt lost, lonely, her mind wandering back to themiscrya and all those there she loved, who loved her, who accepted her. Solari's image burned in her mind, her beloved wife, her beloved children. Not a day went by that she didnt think of them, or pray quietly to her own gods and goddesses for them.<br>
<br>
It had been some time since the male she befriended, Palonius,went in search of Themsicrya, and Solari, it took a long time to talk him into it, if anyone had found out what he was up to, he would die for sure. <br>
For years, she had asked him to do her that one important faver, fo ryears, he said no. She understood, his life and his familes were at risk, his wife just having a baby and all.<br>
<br>
It came to a complete surprise when he turned around and said he would do it. Deianeria cried that night, not for fear and loneliness, as all the other nights, but for joy and hope. Hope that Solari was still in Themiscrya, and the message would reach her, that her wife was not dead.<br>
<br>
Getting up off the couch, she walked to the window and looked up to the sky, the stars were twinkling brightly. A cool breeze wafted through, she pulled her shawl closer around her.<br>
<br>
&quot;By the Gods,please let Solari have gotten the letter.&quot;<br>

It was hard to fathom rest at a time like this. Her mind was racing too fast, along with her heart. In the morning mist, she said a prayer to the gods and then started on the road to Rome. She rode and rode until finally the western gates of the city came into view. A chill went thru her body at the memories of the past. She was here at the same time that her wife was here. If she had only known then.....<br>
<br>
Solari pulled her hood up over to shield her eyes from the stare of the Roman centuries by the gates. No one would reckonize her, but being a female, and a amazon, she would stick out just a little. She made sure that her daggers were close by in case she needed them as she rode quietly into the busy city. She wondered if one of her old friends was still around, perhaps he could offer her shelter until she found out where her wife was at.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alkariawolf@amazonsunite>AlkariaWolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#993300>(5/1/03 9:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=462.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A message for Solari</span><hr size=1> Alkaria followed her aunt Del out of the hut and towards Hippolyte's hut.

She also knew that if certain people knew she were here, they would certainly try to capture her to fight in the arena again. She passed by vendors, smelling the finely spiced meats that she grew to like, then turned down a side street between two large buildings. At the end of that street was the home of a simple man. Old, but wise beyond his own mortal years. They had befriended one another when she had been taken and forced to fight in the arena. He was the medic working to keep those special gladiators ready for combat. <br>
 She stoped her mare in front of the door and saw the freshly baked bread sitting on the window ledge. Someone was home. She hopped off her horse, looped the reins over the post, then walked up to the wooden door and knocked. <br>
<br>
&quot;Who is there?&quot; The voice came from inside. Old, but still commanding. <br>
<br>
&quot;An old friend.&quot; was all that she said as the door opened to a stooped over man with white hair and beard. <br>
<br>
His wrinkled face smiled as Solari removed her hood for him to see her. He pulled her into a gentle hug, knowing full well how amazons reacted to men touching them. Solari returned the hug and kissed him softly on the cheek. <br>
&quot;Tis good to see you again, Maximus.&quot; She replied as he offered the way into his home. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, Solari.&quot; he said getting her something to drink. &quot;I have often wondered what happened to you after you left the city.&quot; He sat the wine down in front of her and grabbed the cooling bread off the window ledge, slicing a piece for her. <br>
&quot;There have been rumors that you were killed in the outlands. Ceasar sent his own personal guards after you to see if it was true.&quot; <br>
<br>
She laughed softly at the idea of her dimise. <br>
&quot;I am sure the only reason that Ceasar did that was to make sure that I wouldnt return to kill him.&quot; She answered sipping the wine and nibbling on the bread. <br>
<br>
&quot;Either way, I am glad to see that it was not true.&quot; He said smiling, then sitting down himself. &quot;So tell me dear friend. What brings you to Rome this time?&quot; <br>
<br>
Solari looked down at her wine goblet before speaking. <br>
&quot;I was sent a message stating that Deianeria was alive and here in Rome. She is being held against her will by some man who now owns her.&quot; <br>
<br>
Maximus thought a moment, recalling the name that was spoken. Solari had told him long ago of her wife and the children they had. He respected the amazon way and Solari. He placed a frail hand ontop of hers and smiled.<br>
&quot;I will help you find your love, my friend.&quot; he said. &quot;you are welcome to stay here as long as you like.&quot; <br>
<br>
Solari smiled and nodded. Sipping her wine again and commenting on how good the bread was in order to break the moment's thought. Good company and rest was all that was needed now. Solari would begin her search later on, in the shadows of the night for her wife.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=deianeriawolf>Deianeria Wolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#993300>(5/4/03 10:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=462.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://216.40.245.157/pictures/244/244_26.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Road to Rome</span><hr size=1> :: She was so deep in thought as she looked out the window, she did not even hear her owner walk in and talk to her.

After that, everything went black.<br>
<br>
When she woke again, she was in what seemed to be a dimly lit closet. In the corner, was nothing but a large pile of rags, which she crawled over to and sat on. It beat sitting on the cold floor. She brought her knees to her chest and rested her head on them, closing her eyes, the tears fell like a river, until she drifted off into an uncomfortable sleep.:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=solariwolf@amazonsunite>solariwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Themiscryian War Queen</span><br>  Posts: 211<br> <font color=#993300>(5/5/03 9:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=462.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The search</span><hr size=1> Solari had wet and laid down in the spare room that Maximus had showed her to.

Not hers, but that of her wife. Solari was good at sensing others emotions, but this was more than that. She sat up in her bed and gasped for air. She rubbed her face, feeling as if it had been hit. <br>
She got up, noticing that the sun was finally setting. She placed her boots back on and walked out to see Maximus waiting on her by the table. <br>
&quot;I went out and did some looking around while you were resting.&quot; He said. &quot;There are four men who own women that are from the Amazon lands.&quot; He sat down in the chair and lit his long pipe. &quot;It seems that the gods are smiling upon you once again, my dear friend.

She wasn't going to give him that satisfaction,though, she would probably pay for that, but she did not care, what was another beating?<br>
<br>

She saw that her friend, despite his aging years, was already waiting on her outside with their horses. <br>
<br>
&quot;I see that you came prepared.&quot; Maximus said, referring to the labyra attached to her saddle. <br>
<br>
Solari nodded as she took the reins.<br>
&quot;Yes, I didnt know what I was going to run into here.&quot; She mounted up, shifting in her saddle to get things straightened. &quot;Besides, an amazon can never have too many weapons.&quot; <br>
<br>
A wicked smile crossed her lips as she followed her friend down the dark alley, then onto the main street. THe sun had set and the only light was that of the candles lit along certain entrances, marking royalty. Solari's heart was pounding as they went to the first house. Could she be lucky enough to find Deianeria at this house? She watched as Maximus motioned for her to stay put on her horse as he dismounted and walked up the steps to the dwelling. Solari knew better than to have her face left uncovered whe dealing with Roman men, so she flipped her hood up to cover her face as she watched with amazon eyes to what was going on at the door. <br>
Minutes later, Maximus came back and whispered that the amazon that was there did not match the description Solari had given him. They continued on to the next house and this time with great care. The owner of this house, was not one for having others come and ask him questions about his slaves. <br>
They went past the house as Maimus said there was a cove nearby where they could leave their horses and come back on foot. Once they were there, Solari patted her horse once more, removed the bow and arrow set, strapping that to her back, then removing the laybras. She gripped the leather bound handle. She had only used this weapon in battle, because of the damage it reaked under her strength. <br>
<br>
&quot;If your wife is here, we will have very little time to get her out safely. This man is not very kind. He was once a soldier in the army. Trained the mercaneries for Caesar.&quot; Maximus whispered as they stopped and ducked behind the wall by the window into the house. <br>
<br>
&quot;The gods will kepp me safe tonight, my friend.&quot; Solari said softly, placing a hand on her friends' shoulder. &quot;I should be worried about you. This is your city, you live here. If you were to get caught...&quot;<br>
<br>
Maxmius stopped her from finishing the sentence with a motion of his hand. Up above them, thru the window came a light. The grumblings of a man were heard as he yelled at something or someone, then slammed a door. Solari listened very carefully to what was said to see if she could hear a woman's voice, but none came. Instead, the scent of jasmine floated out on the air. Something of which was familiar. Deianeria used to bath in jasmine, in which she always had the scent about her. It was intoxicating. Solari peeked into the room to see what she could see, there before her was a tall, burly roman man. He was standing by the door to a small room inside the room he was in. The man was barely clothed. He stood there with nothing but a sheet wrapped around his waist and the sight of that made Solari smirk. Then he opened the door to which he was in front of. There, hiding in the darkness was the shape of a woman. Solari saw with her own eyes, that of her wife. She looked as if she was smaller, weaker than she had been. The man grumbled something to her before reaching in and yanking Deianeria out of the closet. She watched in horror as the Roman began beating her. If it had not been for Maximus, Solari would have jumped thru the window and killed him instantly. But he had grabbed her arm to alert her to the Roman centuries passing by. <br>
<br>
&quot;She is there, Maximus.&quot; She said, her voice shaky. <br>
<br>
&quot;Then we will get her, Solari.&quot; He answered, grabbing his sword. &quot;He will have guards here quickly. I will keep watch for you and fend off as many as I can until you and her are out.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;You risk too much Maximus.&quot; She said. &quot;I can only ask that the gods grant you strength in aiding me tonight. Strength and honour.&quot; She offered her arm in a warriors shake and he returned it, saying the same thing. <br>
<br>
Solari peeked over the legde again, seeing the Roman ontop of his wife, wanting something from her, but she was refusing with all she had in her. She quietly lifted herself up into the room, she could smell ale. He was drunk. This could be to her advantage she thought. Just then, her thoughts went back to where she was standing. <br>
<br>
&quot;Solari.&quot; She heard her name gasped by the woman she loved more than her own life. Deianeria saw her wife for the first time in many years.  <br>

She could smell the ale on his breath, that made her stomach turn, she felt as she would be sick.  When he threw her down and tried to get her cloths from her, she began to flail her arms wildly, trying to fight him off. Grabbing a fistfull of her hair, he slammed her head against the table.::<br>

She also heard the Roman speak in a slirred tongue.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who is this Solari?&quot; he asked, drunk and angered by anothers name. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm Solari.&quot; She answered deeply, full of anger. <br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you?&quot; He asked, rolling off of Deianeria. &quot;How did you get in here?&quot; He wobbled on drunk legs for a moment before getting his balance back. <br>
<br>
Solari noticed the Roman stood a full head above her and was twice as string as she was. That was no matter to her now. <br>
&quot;I am Deianeria's wife and I have come to take her back.&quot; she answered again, desperatly trying to remain calm. Her hand gripped the leather on the axe once more, ready for a swing.<br>
<br>
&quot;You aren't taking that slave anywhere.&quot; He said poking a finger into Solari's chest. &quot;I have broken women like you before and you will have to kill me in order to take her out of this house.&quot; <br>
<br>
Solari just smirked at the killing part, grabbing his hand then twisting it until it cracked. The Roman gasped at the pain in his hand. He was surprised that the woman before him had great strength. He swung a drunk fist at Solari, making contact with her shoulder as she stepped in to block his blow. She raised the Labyras and brought one edge of the double edged axe down onto his leg, slicing it deeply. <br>
&quot;I could have cut that leg off, but i want you to suffer.&quot; She said coldly as the Roman muffled a groan. <br>
<br>
He began calling out to his guards that were inside the house as he limped over to get his sword off the chair nearby. Solari lifted up the axe and smiled at the ready fight. She stepped between Deianeria and the Roman, so at least she could protect her. The Roman swung his sword at her, having it blocked with the axe, only to recieve another slice to the opposite leg. The more blood that flowed thru his wounds, the angrier he got. The Roman began swinging the sword, Solari blocked the swings each time, knowing that he was too drunk to fight like a real man would. She sighed, knowing that her fun with him was going to bed cut short. He didnt deserve to live after what she had seen him to to her wife. Solari raised the battle axe high above her head, then brought it down onto his, splitting him down the middle. She felt his blood hit her face as he fell to the floor, his body twitching. The guards then entered the room with their weapons drawn. She swung her axe at them, cutting the first one in half, then wounding the other one. She turned around, grabbed her wife, placing her gently over her shoulder, she climbed out the window she came in. She saw that Maximus was there, waiting as he said he would be. He watched as his friend passed him, covered in blood. The guards were alerted and gave chase out the window. They were quickly met with the sword from Maximus as Solari made her escape to the horses. <br>
She reached the horses, placed Deianeria upon the warhorse she was riding and mounted up behind her. Solari reached for the reins to Maximus's horse, then pulled out the bow and arrow set, loading a arrow upon the string as she turned her horse around to head back to help Maximus. She let the arrow flt into a Roman century that was about to land a fatal blow to her friend. Another arrow flew into another century, and yet another. The centuries were only a few in numbers and were retreating back into the house, draggin the wounded with them. Solari tossed the reins to her friend, then galloped off into the night with her wife. <br>
Arrangements had been made earlier, Maximus told Solari to ride out of the city, for they would be looking for them both now. He would meet up with them outside the city at the old church ruins he had smuggled her too so long ago. Solari agreed and left the city, riding until she reached the church ruins. Upon getting her wife situated on a make-shift pile of furs that were there, she got a fire going. <br>
&quot;You are still beautiful my love.&quot; She said softly as she smoothed her wife's hair.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=solariwolf@amazonsunite>solariwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Themiscryian War Queen</span><br>  Posts: 226<br> <font color=#993300>(5/27/03 11:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=462.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Thanking the gods....</span><hr size=1> Solari stood there, in the shadows of the fire, keeping an eye out on anyone that might have followed.

Grabbing the labyrs, she moved quickly to where she could get a better look at who was coming up. Her amazon eyes trained on the shadow moving closer towards the church ruins.
