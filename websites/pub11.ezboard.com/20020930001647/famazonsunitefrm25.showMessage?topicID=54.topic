She had to free her sister Kairana, enslaved in Carthage, that mission was seeming impossible, even for the young warrior-priestess of Artemis. Mounted on her loyal mare, Kaheena, she left Ephesus, like guided by Artemis, travelling southern, to the territories of the Phoenicians. She was riding in a deep cedar forest near Byblos, close to the shore when suddenly, men in arms emerged from the forest in circled the young amazon. She tried to resist but one of the men knocked her out with a staff.<br><br>When Livia got back to consciousness she found herself on a ship. Blood had dripped from her forehead and was sticking to her long dark brown hair. She understood that she was on a slave boat but she never lost hope<br><br>After days she arrived to Carthage, as a slave, another Amazon destined to become gladiator. She was determined to survive and save Kairana and if the Great Mother could allow her to survive and become free, to become priestess of the Maiden of the Silver Bow<br><br>Artemis was guiding her and it was time for vengeance against the Roman esclavagists. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kairana>Kairana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#CCCCCC>(9/1/02 10:12:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=54.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mrmagoo.fortunecity.com/parkinson/atlantis.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: On the way to Carthage, Rescuing Kairana</span><hr size=1> Kairana was recovering from a bad wound , in her last combat, the young Amazon gladiator had received a deep spear wound to the thigh and had severely bled. Blood... Her fate was to entertain a bloodthirsty assistance in combats. How much times she had killed because she had no other choice, to kill or be killed, here was the harsh life of gladiator. She was a slave, she had no rights... And the blood of a gladiator was thought to have divine virtues and favorize fertility.<br><br>She wasn't dead, for she was an amazing warrior. Her blood was boiling of desire of revenge, her heart remembering the Amazon Nation. She was only 4 years old when Roman soldiers invaded her village, killed her mother and took her and her baby sister as war captives. She had not much memories for she was too young, but sometimes she got flashes. She was no more remembering who she was, where she came from, only that she was from a village where women were free and of a baby, her sister, Sinope Amarice and of a tall, dark haired warrior, who was no one else than her mother, struck to death by invadors, but her name, who she was was for Kairana mysteries.<br><br>Now she was between consciousness and unconsciousness, feeling deep weakness. She was wanting to kill the inhuman wretchs who were enslaving her, but her energies were so low<br>In her visions, she was seeing a dark haired warrior coming to save her, an angel? Or could it be Sinope Amarice, her sister lost so long ago?<br><br>She was seeing all the ordeals Sinope had to pass, would have prefered to die than to see her sister fall in the hands of the Roman esclavagists who had destroyed her life.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=livia>Livia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#CCCCCC>(9/2/02 11:15:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=54.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mrmagoo.fortunecity.com/royo/sketch/sketch42.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: On the way to Carthage, Rescuing Kairana</span><hr size=1> After a long road over the seas, Sinope arrived to Carthage, as a slave and sold for the gladiatoral games. She was now in the same arena where her sister fought and had to fight three colossus, one armed with a long spear, the other one with a sword,the third with a pike. Sinope drew her sword, as the first gladiator charged. With a mighty hit from her sword, she cut the spear in two parts, grabbed it and plunged it deep in her opponent's throat.The second one came to charge and Sinope blocked his hits. She came to offensive but her opponent blocked her hit with so much might while kicking her that she lost her sword and fell on the ground. When her opponent drew his sword to give the final shot, she rolled, grabbed her sword on the ground and blocked his sword. In a mighty kick, she freed herself, rose up and returned on offensive. This time, her opponent hadn't the time to defend himself and the Amazon's sword pierced through his heart. But at that time, the third gladiator plunged his pike in Sinope's breast and she fell on the ground with a cry of pain. But determined to survive, she took her last energies to break the pike with her sword and plunge it into her opponent's heart.<br><br>The taste of blood was in Sinope's mouth, the iron of the pike had made internal damage. She fell in unconsciousness and got brought in the same piece where was lying Kairana.
