The night was unusually warm of February, and Apollo had just come back from a lively hunt with Artemis so he was in his usually high spirits. The laughter soon faded as he began to sing a soft tune that he had been working on for the past few weeks, maybe he would find the answer tonight...the night was perfect afterall...<br>
<br>
And then he felt it.<br>
<br>
His heart began to thump out of his chest.<br>
<br>
His pupils dialated.<br>
<br>
As he walked into the throne room he felt it even stronger.<br>
<br>
His eyes squinted yet there was no light.<br>
<br>
It was hard to see for a second. Everything was black. But not normal black...not dark... it was like a black light...a STRONG black light.<br>
<br>
His aura illuminated the rooms as the figures of darkness came into perfect sight. <br>
<br>
Hades, Hecate, Nyx, Hypnos , and the rest, all mysterious beings of the night...he had stepped into the wrong room, at the wrong time. His golden aura flared and began to quarrel with the darker aura's that filled the room. A thousand thoughts and a thousand conclusions flooded his head, for a second he wondered why Artemis wasn't invited to such a...meeting of the night...but such things were irrelevant. He was paused in his step, the only things on him moving was his eyes, blinking and jumping around from figure to figer, and his sandy blonde hair blowing in the brisk winter wind.<br>
<br>
This all happened in an instant...<br>
<br>
Apollo smiled uneasily as he strode into the room, his body language and mannurisms not showing the slightest indignation of fright or uncomfertablness.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good evening...&quot; he smiled as he walked further into the room, there was no use turning back now. He had to proove to himself that the God of Light himself could kick it with the bad boys...and girls. Atleast he was dressed appropriatly, in a dark green tunic...his golden sandels, blonde hair and blue eyes stood out a bit though.<br>
<br>
&quot;What...&quot; he cleared his throat.<br>
&quot;...brings you all to Olympus?&quot;<br>
