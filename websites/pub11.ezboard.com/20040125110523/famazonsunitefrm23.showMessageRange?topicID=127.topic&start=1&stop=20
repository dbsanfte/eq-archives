His long hair having been shaved off along wit any facial hair, in preparing for war. There was a reason Alastor was feared for generations in his home land. He was 'The demon of the battlefield' unchallenged in skill in his lands, as of yet anyway. To fear in battle is to fear death, that was no way to fight because even with fear you won't live on second longer. He was immortal and the only honorable death was to die in battle, therefore he fought whenever he thought it was needed. &quot;I came for Zeus's council and I get him Family tree..

&quot;Well, if you must go stay for just one song.&quot;<br>

Alastor, Alastor, why do you go?<br>
You pick on the ladys and then hit the floor.<br>
You try to be macho, though it doesnt work.<br>
Your just a sexest biggot, you incompetent jerk.<br>
As you leave to go,<br>
You stick you head in the air,<br>
Although you think your big and bold,<br>
Do you think we realy care?<br>
So flee, flee, flee little Alastor,<br>
