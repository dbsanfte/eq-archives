He had merely blinked innocently. <br>
Kure was watching him now in contempt. &quot;At least -you- get to enjoy your little vacation, you lazy rat.

She cleared her throat. "Did I hear revenge? Am I bored as a skunked dog in a vat of aubergines? You betcha!" She jumped over to the other end of the deck, and grunted as she hauled the anchor over the side. "Let's go. I'll string up the bastard with his own anemic little entrails."
