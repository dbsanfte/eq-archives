At first, he was not sure he really wanted this task.  But, as the promised gifts where told to him from the three goddesses..the world had seemed to move in his favor.  <br>
To rule the world would be incredible.  All would bow to him and shower him with many gifts.  Never would he hear the word no again.<br>
But, then to be strong and mightier then any mortal.  That would bring him surely many of the same promises as the first.<br>
Then there was Aphrodite's gift.  The goddess of love had surely delved deep into Paris's heart.  For there was one thing he wanted above all.  And his lust was stronger then his wisdom.  Helen, a daughter of Zeus, and the most lovely of all mortals was a great prize.  True, she was married.   But, with Aphrodite's promise, he could still have her.<br>
The handsome man could not think anymore, it was too much.  He turned his eyes to Aphrodite and, not thinking of the reprocusions of his decision spoke.<br>
&quot;Aphrodite is the fairest of all,&quot; his words were simple, but to the point.  The point? Well, he wanted Helen that was the point for him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenhera.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Queen Hera</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 174<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/25/01 8:32:34 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/qhera.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: And we'll make beautiful music together.</span><hr size=1> As her brother spoke to her, Hera's face had lightened to a smile.  Tho they had recently had a little disagreement, Hera had still love her brother, The King of the Sea.  She winked tenderly to him as he withdrew from her and then glared at Apollo.  His pompus attitude was now becoming more then annoying.  And she was certainly not going to prance around like some idiot nymph to prove how fair she was.  For it was not who was the most buxom...but who was the fairest.<br>
Arms folded she watched as her two "rivals" were tempting young Paris.  Surely, he wanted to rule the world more then just be strong or have a beautiful woman.<br>
But, when his judgement was given....again Hera's eyes turned cold.<br>
"What a fool you are Paris!  Menelaus will surely never allow this.  He will not give up his wife for you or for any promises of Aphrodite!"  Her voice was frigid as she spoke. <p>~~<<<<<<{{{{@</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugoddesseris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goddess Eris</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/chaoticdiscordxx/images/eris2.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/25/01 2:04:09 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/chaoticdiscordxx/images/eris1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: And we'll make beautiful music together.</span><hr size=1> :: Eris smirked that usual smirk and giggled, she hopped off the table and snatched the apple before anyone could stop her.::<br>

Well then, I guess that's that then. ::She walked over to Aphrodite and held her prize out to her.:: Well, I guess your the fairest of them then...Here is your prize.<br>
