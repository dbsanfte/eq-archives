Walking in she covered her walls, cieling, windows, with the Fur. Then she pushed everything against the wall to further block the cold, then pushed her bed into the center. That would keep things warm for now. Turning and walking back out she dropped off a case of wyne and bread in her hut as well. <br>
<br>
 Saddling back up she went around to the main hut, leaving the cases of food and wyne from Orio-pata at the door, turning the rest of the horse with the furs she dropped a few at the elders doors, and then rode to the stables.<br>
 <br>
 Climbing from the saddle she went in with armfuls of pelts, placing an extra on each stall door, giving every horse 3-4 pelts instead of the usual amount. She then went about, lining the walls of each horses stalls and ceiling. Grinning as she left the stables promptly after, leaving the horses there. <br>
<br>
 Carrying the remaining pelts she dropped them at Alysia's hut, for her an Wulf, then more at Sartha's. <br>
<br>
 Carrying herself out to her training grounds, she began pulling the equipment back into Themiscrya's main area. Leaving it she began building an extra storing hut for the deer that would be brought into the village as extra. This hut would freeze it and be accesible for those who needed abit, stopping as other Amazons took over she left, picking up some old deer skins she walked to the hut where they would store the wood. Covering the walls there, and the ceiling she then covered the piles of wood.<br>
<br>
 The now exhausted Dawn stood outside the hut, sighing lightly. <br>

These were items they had picked up on their way back from Halon. She walked to the different huts, finding some already. Those that were not, she left fur and food for. She brought the rest of the food and furs to the storage hut, piling them neatly inside. She then left for her own hut, finding the furs Dawn had left at her door and smiling slightly. She bent and picked them up, then entered her hut wearily, only to be rushed by three other worried animals. Vortex nearly bowled her over, and a half-grown Veran did manage to tackle her.
