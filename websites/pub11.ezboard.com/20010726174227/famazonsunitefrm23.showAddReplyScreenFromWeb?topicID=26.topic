Judging by the position of the sun, it was now High Noon.  Releasing a deep sigh, he takes a deep breath and finds his way through the forest to a very large tree.<br>
     The nearly 9 foot tall hulking beast takes the battle axe from his back and sits down, leaning his back up against the tree and once again releases a deep sigh.  His mind began to once again wander.  He closed his eyes and in a flash his memories flooded his mind like a collapsed dam releasing a river.<br>
     <br>
     &quot;He began remembering his village back on Crete as a young child.  He remembers it being peaceful.  But in what was a flash in his mind, the peacefulness gave way to fire and war.  He remembers the overwhelming army of humans and Centaurs coming through and slaughtering the small village of minotaurs.  His mother and father dying by the sword of several soldiers.  Just as the soldiers were closing in on him, almost in the blink of an eye, he was saved.  An old man came and saved him.  He was a human, but much larger than most.  This man had scared the soldiers closing in on him off and scooped the very young minotaur up.   <br>
     Mojo remembered this man, who turned out to be his grandfather.  A titan he was.  One who stood against the Olympians in the Great Power Struggle.  Sentenced to fall in love with a minotauress as his punishment.  In the same instant, he remembers being taken to the great halls of Olympus to be raised in his early years.  His grandfather was teaching him to be a scholar in his formative years.  That however was not to be, as the gods decided he should not reside up there with them.  Every god had their reason.  Be it personal or wheeling and dealing.  He was banished from Olympus and sent back to earth.<br>
     Not a few days later after his return, he was captured by a slaver.  Having very few fighting skills he was taken quite easily.  His &quot;freak&quot; appeal and his colossal strength made him a perfect candidate to become an enslaved Pit-fighter.  It is here that he learned the hard lessons of battle.  Fighting to stay alive he gradually grew meaner and less civilized, giving into the minotaur rage, but maintaining his intelligence.  After a century of enslavement and having changed masters on a couple of occasions, he finally gained his freedom after murdering his master.  Mojo then remembers the time he spent as a Mercenary soldier.  Pillaging and plundering, fighting the battle field and laying waste to nearly entire armies with only but a few men or beasts on his side.  He traveled to other lands and other realms and slowly gained his humanity back.  One of the events he remembers that brought it back was seeing his grandfather once again.  His grandfather gave him one last gift before being forced out of Olympus himself and never being heard from again, that of an axe forged by Hephaestus himself.  The titan blood within his veins made him immortal.  He traveled and adventured for nearly 3 thousand years.  <br>
     He remembers meeting his match against a goddess from another realm who defeated him and his ally in combat.  Mojo was then forced to travel to the Underworld.  Charon guided his way through.  It is here that Mojo saw for the first time in millenia, and Olympian god, Hades.  He hoped Hades did not remember him and avoided him.  After a bit of struggle, Mojo managed to escape escape the Underworld after defeating Cerberus in  one heck of a 'dog fight'.&quot;<br>
<br>
     Mojo yawned as he opened his eyes, shaking the flashback out of him.  He looked around, now remembering where it was he managed to &quot;rise&quot; from the Underworld.  That being the lands surrounding Olympus, a Place he has not been to since being a boy and then a captive.  He looked around now being a Freeman and enjoyed it with a bit more appreciation.  He then stood up, using his mighty battle axe as leverage.  He slung his axe over his shoulder and continued his walking.  He wondered if any of the Olympian gods had actually remembered him from way back when.  After all this was quite a long time ago, and he was not quite as large then, and always deemed &quot;insignificant&quot; in their eyes, at least he thought so anyways.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uixlordhadesxi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>IX Lord Hades XI</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(4/16/01 2:37:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sitting beneath a tree in thought...</span><hr size=1> The area area around some of the trees darken as the shadows gain strength.  Hades steps out of them, in front of this enormous minotaur.  The Lord of the Underworld smirks at his recent 'escapee'.  He folds his arms and begins pacing around him.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Well well well...if it isn't, oh what the monacer you go by now, 'Mojo'?  Listen to me, boy...&quot;<br>
<br>
As he reaches up and presses under his chin with his forefinger.<br>
<br>
&quot;::Sarcastic Tone:: I HATE to be the one to burst your bubble, ::now a serious tone:: but the only reason you escaped the Underworld is because I allowed you to do so.  And I don't want you to have illusions otherwise.  Yeah you beat Cerberus fair and square, a feat which very few can do, I'll give you that.  But if I was truly hell-bent against you leaving, you wouldn't have.  So don't allow yourself to be fooled otherwise or become arrogant because you 'beat death'. &quot;<br>
<br>
He then continues to pace around him, awaiting a reaction. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/utheerinyes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Erinyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(4/16/01 10:12:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Tisiphone appeared. . .</span><hr size=1> In a whirl of black flames, Tisiphone, the silent &quot;Freak&quot; Furie appeared standing in between Hades and Mojo.

She turned her back to Hades and looked to Mojo kindly. Something hardly ver seen from a Furie. She of course could not speak for her mere voice would destroy him from the drive to insanity and pain.

He growled slightly at the sight of Hades.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh and why is it you 'let' me escape oh Mighty Hades?&quot; he ramarked in a sarcatic and condecending tone.  &quot;I'm not afraid you of you.  Not even when I was a child did I fear you.  Nor do I now, nor will I EVER!  So approaching me and talking down to me like this won't help you.  Only makes me lose respect for you.  And if you are wondering why I avoided you in the Underworld, it is due to the fact that, I pick and choose my battles.  A battle with you at that point in time would not have benefited me.&quot;<br>
<br>
His growling tone seemed to dull a bit at the appearance of Tisiphone.  He remembered his brief encounter with the Furies when he was young.  The three sisters were impossible to forget once seen again.  He even remembers feeling their presense, though not visibly, on some of the battlefields he fought.  He noded a bit and smiled.  He had a strong feeling she was here as an ally and not an enemy.  He put his axe on the leather hanger that slung to his back.  He bowed slightly to Tisiphone and then very slowly and very gently touched her cheek, as a silent 'Thank You' for intervening on his behalf before Hades. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=hypnos>Hypnos </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(4/16/01 12:41:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=C:\WINDOWS\Desktop\Stuff\hypnos.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ***Hypnos Appears***</span><hr size=1> ***Hypnos Appears from the darkness of the forest in a cloud of sparkling myst, and blue light, wearing a long  blue hood + cloak as is sort of floated and danced around behind him.

He then pats Mojo on his massive shoulder before stepping back on folding his arms again, and a wry grin playing upon his face.  <br>
