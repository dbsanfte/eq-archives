She'd been welcomed into Scynthia by Aly, but she felt slightly awkward, being one of the very few adolescents in the tribe... She shrugged slightly, Amazon sisters were rarely unkind to each other, she had no reason to feel nervous...

During that time, she and Alysia had been training day and night. Going through many trials for Belle.<br>
<br>
Most of the younger amazons Belle's age had gone through their usual training or at least some to have future knowledge of the upcomming training in their specific area. <br>
<br>
Belle was different though. Alysia had plans for the young girl. Belle would be skilled as Alysia had been. In each area of the Amazon Traits. Belle had already pretty good knowledge in the use of sais and that was found useful to Aly. Her battle skills were wonderful though her attitude towards herself was a bit high. Belle needed to learn humility towards others as well as the things around her. She had a strong amazon spirit inside of her, she just didn't know it yet. Lucky for Belle, Alysia did.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come Belle, there is something you need to see.&quot; <br>
Alysia said as she moved through the Scynthian caves. The torch was bright and lit up the caves quickly. Belle followed behind her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your mother died when you were very young Belle. She was an amazon yes, but not a very popular one. I myself didn't even know her.&quot; She looked back to Belle to see if she was still there.<br>
<br>
They proceeded onward towards a small wall that had ancient carvings on it. &quot;This os one of the Scynthian records. Each amazon that passes on into the amazon lands of the dead, should be recorded here. If not, their spirit is within anyways.&quot; She looked down at Belle. &quot;I thought you might want to see this.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> AmazonBelle</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(5/8/01 3:49:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=131.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Days after Belle's arrival</span><hr size=1> Belle glanced towards the ground, then back up at Aly. <br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you... I really don't know who my mother was, even her name, but maybe this will help.&quot;<br>
<br>
She hesitated before looking over at the wall of names, she didn't want to believe her mother was dead, she had always hoped it was all a mixup, but seeing the many names scralled on the walls, she knew it was no mixup. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualysiaofscynthia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alysia of Scynthia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#993300>(5/9/01 12:27:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=131.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Days after Belle's arrival</span><hr size=1> Alysia looked down and turned walking away from the area leaving Belle to make her peace with her mother.<br>
<br>
Later on when Belle returned. .  . <br>
<br>
&quot;There is no doubt in my mind that your mother died for a good cause. Who knows? She might have died saving you perhaps. I know I would give my life for any of my children.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then began to walk towards the outside of the cave.<br>
<br>
Neither of them spoke until sunlight hit their eyes as they walked out of the opening of the cave.<br>
<br>
&quot;A mother is a precious thing Belle. I too lost my mother. I was raised mostly by my Queen and my older sister Genesis.&quot;<br>
<br>
She placed her hand on Belle's shoulder.<br>
<br>
&quot;I do not want you to forget the short memory and honor of your birth mother, nor would I like to take her place in my heart. But as long as you are in my lands, in my tribe. You shall be considered as my daughter. With as much honor as any of my children would recieve.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled and awaited Belle's response. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> AmazonBelle</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(5/10/01 9:22:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=131.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Days after Belle's arrival</span><hr size=1> Belle's eyes widened, she was barely able to speak... So many thoughts rushed through her mind... Aly had always been like family, but would being considered Aly's daughter be dishonoring her mother?<br>
<br>
Even with all the doubts in her mind, Belle smiled lightly... She was finally going to have a family. <br>
<br>
&quot;I hope this won't change things between us...&quot; She finally spoke, &quot;We can still be friends, and mother/daughter, sort of, right?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualysiaofscynthia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alysia of Scynthia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#993300>(5/10/01 11:24:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=131.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Mother daughter. . .</span><hr size=1> Alysia smiled to Belle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Belle, you have always been a close friend of mine. Not many people know about you, or about the time I spent with you in Rome. I cared too much to bring you into my stories like some character.&quot;<br>
<br>
She sat down on a fallen log outside to adjust the tightness of her boots.<br>
<br>
&quot;I mourned your death for many years Belle. It was as if I had actually lost my daughter. My blood.&quot; She glanced down and sighed. &quot;Do not get me wrong. I love my own children, they are all amazing in their own ways of course. But I have always wanted a daughter that was an amazon. One that wanted to be at least.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked back up to Belle.<br>
<br>
&quot;All of my children have many things to attend to. Other duties. And some even have families of their own. But when I was raising Cora in Rome to be a lady, it killed me. I wanted a daughter to teach the warrior ways, the amazon skills to. You know? Someone to carry on something. And when I first started to teach you to hand fight, and practice your flips . . . it made me proud.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have something in you Belle. Something great. I've always known that. Nothing shall change between us.

&quot;Well, I guess you got your Amazon daughter after all, offically, I mean.&quot;<br>
