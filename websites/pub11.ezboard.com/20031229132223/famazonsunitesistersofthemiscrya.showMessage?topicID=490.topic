They leave their humble little hut that Theseus helped build and make their way across the village to the Queens hut.  <br>
<br>
They come to the front entrance where two guards are always present.  Celaneo slowly approaches the first guard, &quot;Hi again, my sister Lalita and I would like to see my Aunt Hippolyte please?&quot; The guard goes inside to let the queen know we are requesting to see her.  Celaneo and Lalita patiently wait outside.  <br>
<br>
She nervously turns to Lalita, &quot;What are we exactly going to say about this,&quot; pointing to her tummy.  She starts to ramble, &quot;How will we explain... how... who... when.. &quot; <br>

I am going to need to get as much information as I can about what we are going to expect, and getting worried is not going to help.&quot; She smiles warmly at Celaneo, looking calm and not at all worried. Inside her head, she is running in little circles, extremely worried about not only Celaneo's health, but what Hippolyte might say when she learns everything. She has never meet the Queen and Aunt of Celaneo, and is not sure what to expect; and whether informing her that her young niece is pregnant should be done face to face, or maybe done with a couple of mountains in between them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hippolyte>Hippolyte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Platinum Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 988<br> <font color=#993300>(5/29/03 8:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=490.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/Hippwknife1ezboard.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A visit to Hippolyte</span><hr size=1> Soon the guard returned with an attendant, &quot;Come with me.&quot; She spoke calmy and led them both into the main room of the hut.
