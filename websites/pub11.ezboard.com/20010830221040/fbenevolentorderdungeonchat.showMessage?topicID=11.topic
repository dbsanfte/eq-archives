Last week's raid was a disaster.  Firstly, the raid was somehow moved to sol a instead of najena.  None of the guild leaders excepting khoal even tried to take charge and he had to leave fairly early on so there was a serious lack of leadership there, and incidentally I noticed at least 4 guild officers online who did not attend.  The lower level characters were slaughtered and disappointed in the raid, the higher level character group, of which I was part, got killed twice.  All in all, there was no organization, leadership, no guides on the dungeon.  I felt like it wasn't really even a raid.  Just a group of friends going into a new dungeon without a clue.  Now I also happened to attend the raid from mystic earlier this week to the same locale.  Theirs was organized, no one died, and there were several players familiar with the dungeon in on the raid.  I'm not trying to point fingers or blame anyone for last weeks disaster, but I suggest that we start designating at least two people to lead, organize and guide the raiders each week, otherwise, I'm afraid people are going to stop attending raids all together.  I won't mention names, but I talked to two guild officers after the disasterous raid and asked why they didn't come.  Both of them more or less told me they EXPECTED the raid to turn into a mess so they decided not to go.  Now what does that say to the rest of us when the officers expect the raid to suck.  What it comes down to is this, if we are going to have raids lets do them and do them well so everyone will want to attend, otherwise, we might as well just cancel the raids and save everyone some headache.  Just my 2cp there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugiradella.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Giradella</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Jr. Administrator</span><br>  Posts: 104<br> <font color=#D3BE74>(3/12/01 12:55:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/fbenevolentorderdungeonchat.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://eagle.cc.ukans.edu/~stinnett/Girasmall.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Last Weeks raid</span><hr size=1> I would like to apologize for not showing up at the raid on Saturday evening.  I was in Lower Guk the whole evening gaining experience.  As a result of being there all afternoon and evening, I gained enough xp to get halfway through one of the worst hell levels, 45.  I should have dropped it to come to the raid, but I didn't.  I am sorry for the lack of judgement on my part.<br>
<br>
One reason that I did not go, though, was that when people started logging on, I asked if they were going to Najena.  Nobody expressed any interest in heading there from where they were, so I just kind of dropped the subject assuming that nobody wanted to raid that evening.  Then Khoal got on and wanted to go somewhere where he could get experience, which is understandable, but that makes it tough for the lower level members.  I agree that the Mystic Entity raid was very well led. Snork is an excellent leader.  Another thing is that even if I was there, I could not have guaranteed no deaths because I, myself, do not know the zone of Sol A at all.  I feel that my knowledge of the zone is too limited for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> me</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to lead the raid.<br>
<br>
My suggestion would be that if you do not enjoy the place where we are raiding for the month (i.e. Najena), voice your concerns here.  It seemed as if nobody wanted to go back to Najena.  Would you guys rather go back to Unrest?  Was that a better raid location?  I was not able to attend any of the Unrest raids due to RL issues.  I cannot lead a guild without support from the members.  I do not get support from members unless you all tell me what you are thinking.  Since there is such limited use of these message boards, it is hard to know what everyone wants.<br>

<br>
Khoal is bad luck in dungeons!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I followed him into Crystal Caverns one time and got killed twice.  Nobody was around for a rez and I lost a level.  The next week, Valmar went to CC with Khoal, and practically the same thing happened.   I went to help recover Val's corpse the next day.  Khoal is a good player, but sometimes bites off more than he can chew.  (no offense intended)<br>
<br>
/jokingmode off<br>
<br>
Generally, raids tend to go better if they are planned out.  I believe the Mystic raid had been planned well in advance.  They had decided where in the zone they were going, and what they were doing.  Things were conned and then assigned to the groups that got experience for them.  This is the type of planning that is needed to carry out succesful raids, I believe.  It is very difficult to make a raid successful when thrown together at the last minute.  If you guys want to raid Sol A, then I will volunteer to go and spend some time there and see what is around.  I would like to have some company if I am to do this.  Perhaps Valmar, Arichiena, Dadijob and Rensai or Elupis could help me out with that.  /em wishes we had a cleric.<br>
<br>
Val, Dadi and Arich, please post times that you could do this with me.  Us higher folk need to explore some places for possible raids.<br>
<br>
I will post about our weekly raids on Mystic Entity's message board and invite them to come along.  With more people, the chances of dying are less, assuming it's not just a clusterf&amp;%$.<br>
<br>
Again, I cannot be a good leader without the help of my members.  Please, please, please get people to USE THESE BOARDS!  I have tried, but to no avail.  We consistently only have around 5 people who will post.  When I do a /who all benevolent and see 12-15 people on at once, I wonder why we only get 3-4 posts per week on the board.  Just doesn't make sense.<br>

I don’t mean this as a flame and not necessarily the stance of the guild. Just my own personal point of view.<br>
<br>
  “at least 4 guild officers online who did not attend.”<br>
<br>
 Attending Officers<br>
 Khoal, Gokulot Elupis, Mathusis, Arichiena <br>
 Non-attending Officers online (that I was aware of)<br>
 Giradella, Germania <br>
Eorgal is not an officer unless recently appointed, Giradella explained herself and at lev 29 it would’ve been suicide for Germania to attempt to meet up with us going solo to an area he had never been before. Remember that this was not the intended location for raid. I don’t expect every officer to be at every guild raid though I feel that the responsibility should be shared among officers when raid is within their individual experience level. <br>
<br>
“None of the guild leaders excepting Khoal even tried to take charge” <br>
<br>
  I hope to never be in a group where leadership is based on officer status. <br>
Within a guild, officers are elected or appointed with different responsibilities in mind. I have some knowledge of tradeskills, Gokulot maintains the vault, and other officers were appointed to make it easier to enlist new members. I went on the raid in support of a guild function. I never intended to take charge of a raid in an area that I had no experience or knowledge of.        <br>
 <br>
“Two guild officers told me they EXPECTED the raid to turn into a mess”<br>
<br>
That is attitude we can’t afford to have from any member in the guild much less an officer.  I’m guessing the comment is in response to going to an area where they themselves had no familiarity. <br>
<br>
The rest, I am sorry to say, I am pretty much in agreement with Rensai.  <br>
<br>
My 2cp on the subject<br>
<br>
   I think the problem goes beyond just an organizational issue. There is also an experience issue. Our highest-ranking members are low to mid 40s. Many of our higher members have not had the opportunity to group with higher levels and are just as new to these dungeons as the people they are taking.  We need to get to a point where at the very least, the people leading the raid are familiar with the area. I completely agree that a group should be formed to scout out and familiarize themselves with an area that they are going to lead. <br>
<br>
  I think we should also establish guidelines when putting a guild raid together. The following is only my personal opinion as to what is needed. I freely admit I am not an authority on raids and welcome any comments/changes/suggestions anyone else has. But is important that some kind of guideline be set so that expectations are both understood and met.   <br>
<br>
1. First and foremost establish the objective of the raid. <br>
Are you going for experience, to camp and item or to familiarize a group with an area.<br>
Most raids are not for experience so if this is not the objective then make this clear. This way people won’t complain because they got little or none. There are usually for one of 2 reasons for raids:<br>
 A) So a group of appropriate level players can get familiar with an area with the support/safety of higher levels teaching them. Now that they have learned the tricks to what they need to survive that area they can return on their own. If this is the case then it is essential that we have leaders that are real familiar with the area and those leaders are established ahead of time.<br>
 B) Camping/Farming   Often raids are created to gather items for guild members or help obtain a needed quest item. In this case the item(s) should be determined ahead of time with a few backups in the event that that item is already camped. This is where the support of guild members is essential and the understanding that at some point you will asked to go on a raid to help someone obtain an item that you yourself may get no experience or benefit from.<br>
2. Establish level range required to go on the proposed raid. If you try and set up a raid to cover all levels it WILL either fall apart requiring too many leaders trying to support all the different level ranges or people will die being in groups they are to low to be in. <br>
3. Establish the location that the raid is to take place. Most dungeons will support multiple level ranges. If a location is set for a 1-month period you can divide different weekly raids into different level ranges that have been predetermined.<br>
4. Establish who will be the leaders for the raid and each group. These leaders should already be well familiarized with area as well as what tactics are required. If the appointed leader for a group can not show or must leave the group then the raid ends then and there for that group. <br>
5. Raids that are set up to take place in an area that is new to a group should begin at or near entrance and then expanded from there as group becomes more familiar with layout. Specifically, an escape route.    <br>
6. Once groups are established, individual roles should be assigned within the group. Everyone should know who is in charge, who the main tank is, the main healer, who is responsible for whom, what role they play and most importantly what the evac plan is and who decides when to evac. <br>
<br>
   Happy to be a part of any group to scout an area before raid. Would almost insist on it if I were expected to be involved in a leadership role.  I like the list Giradella put together though I hope to see Khoal included since he seems to have extensive experience and knowledge of many areas. <br>
<br>
   As far as inviting other guilds to raids I personally feel that we should get ourselves experienced in running them first. It’s bad enough when we lose our own members on a raid. I would hate it even more to be responsible for the deaths of members of another guild we invited. Don’t think it would do much for our reputation. <br>
 <br>
  As an Enchantress I can be of some help with lower level player raids. I can buff/debuff/Rune/Clarity without taking away from their exp. I can also keep a few groups of mobs Mezzed and put them on hold. <br>
  <br>
  Unless of course we are in a small 4 sided room with doors on each side for mobs to come through and a room that consists of nothing more than a ledge circling a large pillar taking up almost the entire room that you can neither see or cast around and containing multiple mobs all timed to spawn at the same time who summon other mobs to their aid.    <br>
   But hey, what are the odds of finding a place like that. <br>

(Reaches out fingers to strangle Gira)<br>
<br>
Trying to retype from memory:<br>
<br>
You know folks, I'm not really sure where to begin here so lemme just dive right in and ramble a bit.<br>
<br>
When I logged on that night, I asked around if anything was going on.  What I got back was a bunch of replies saying basically, noone was interested in Najena so as far as everyone knew there was no raid.  I first suggested we do something in Velious.  Needless to say, there wasn't alot of support for that idea.  I then suggested Sol a for 3 very basic reasons:  I know the zone very well, I've been there on and off since 14th lvl so I know 2 groups of different levels can survive, and there were quest items/stuff to be obtained for the larger crowd.<br>
<br>
Lets fast forward to the zone in point.  A great job was done collecting people and getting them to the zone.  After I myself was waiting there approx. 20 minutes (listening to multiple tells of 'when is the raid beginning') I went afk for about 2 minutes.  When I get back, the last people have arrived and everyone is already zoned in and gone.  I SPECIFICALLY said wait until everyone gets here so I can give people a brief overview of what our objectives/what the dangers inside are going to be.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I zone in, people are wandering around killing random stuff near the zone, get everyone to the Rug Room to set up the small camp.  For those of you that don't know, the Rug Room is about 5 steps from a fairly safe zone to Sol B.  AKA it has an escape route.  I'm not sure how everyone was getting slaughtered there but I am curious.<br>
<br>
After leaving a 52nd lvl wizard friend of mine to keep an eye on the small group for a bit.  The large group sets out and starts sweeping through the dungeon.  We wipe out a large portion of the goblin area and I can see people are starting to get bored.<br>
<br>
About this time is where all hell breaks loose.  I am getting spamed with tells by people from both groups.  Why aren't we moving?  I just died please come help.  Let's go kill critter x so I can get y.  Our whole party just got wiped out, why aren't you here?  This continued for about 30 minutes while I'm running back and forth trying to make people happy.  I set the large group up in the Lava Elemental room, run to the small group to help them and they are dead, run the 52nd lvl wizard back to the Lava room to help bigger group, run back to the small group to help with corpses, etc. etc.<br>
<br>
To finish the story, by this time I have a splitting headache and just can't take it anymore.  I am only one person last time I counted myself.  I can't be in more than one place at once, I can't hold 20 conversations and fully explain everything at one time, and I can't keep staring at a list of tells with a hideous headache.<br>
<br>
I am sorry that people died going to Sol A.<br>
<br>
Honestly, there are a million other places I would rather be because I've seen the place so many times.  I wasn't trying to go there for EXP or PHAT LEWT, I was hoping some people would enjoy it.  I can solo in Crystal Caverns and get better exp or stuff then I could there.<br>
<br>
The main point is if we are going to do anything serious we need to come together...TOGETHER.  That means less talking and more listening for one.  I realize this isn't a dragon raid where you are thrown out for sending tells to the leader but lets be reasonable.  Don't send the leader multiple private tells and wonder why they aren't responding.  Everyone else is sending tells too.  How many conversations are YOU capable of holding while trying to fight and get somewhere.<br>
<br>
Respect and appreciate other peoples help.  We are all supposed to be playing to have a good time, but that is accomplished much better by playing well TOGETHER.<br>
<br>
On a completely seperate note, in my role as 'RaidMaster' I have asked for people to give me suggestions multiple times.  I have received a TOTAL of zero suggestions on where people would like to set up a raid.  Let's try to set some raids up that get specific things that people need.  Then we can move on to the next place.  Makes it much easier to plan when you have a purpose.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, enough of my ramblings<br>

I think theres a little misunderstanding about my post.  I'll start with ari's comments.<br>
<br>
on attending or not attending officers I'm not going to comment, again, I don't want to point fingers or imply all officers should attend all raids.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I hope to never be in a group where leadership is based on officer status. <br>
Within a guild, officers are elected or appointed with different responsibilities in mind. I have some knowledge of tradeskills, Gokulot maintains the vault, and other officers were appointed to make it easier to enlist new members. I went on the raid in support of a guild function. I never intended to take charge of a raid in an area that I had no experience or knowledge of.&quot;<br>
<br>
I agree with this completely ari, and I was not implying that officers should only lead or that officers are responsible for everything.  However, I think when no other leader has been appointed, officers should at least take charge and designate one.<br>
<br>
ok, now for khoal's post.<br>
khoal, your post sounds really defensive, and I hope you don't feel like anyone is blaming you.  I certainly am not blaming you for what happened.  I'm sure it was a real tough situation for you as the only guide there having everyone asking for help.  Again, it is not your fault at all.  you did as well as any single person could.  If we had had a few more of you we probably would have been fine <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   The real problem was that we didn't have more of you and didn't have things planned out better.  <br>
<br>
Lastly, i'm not trying to bitch at the officers or blame them.  I am just trying to suggest that we organize a little better and prepare for the raids with designated guides, etc.  Now it doesn't matter if the guides are officers or not, but the officers do need to take charge here and at least appoint some people and ensure that the raids are organized.  We can organize in a lot of different ways and ari posted a lot of good stuff on that so i'm not gonna go into to much detail.  I think most of us have a pretty good idea how we want things to go.  <br>

  Actually I was anything but bored. Especially after dropping down into a pit and finding myself alone with an Efretti, a couple elementals and a goblin wizard to keep me company. <br>
<br>
  It would be preference to keep raids to one level range at a time until we have become a bit more successful at running these. Keep to a single location for a month but have different raids based on level range. As Mystic did by setting a level range for their raid. However, I will support and stand by any decision the guild makes. <br>

If we can get someone who will set out to plan and carry out a raid for their level, that would be great, but if those of us who are over 30 have to lead it, then it kind of turns into an all level range raid if you know what I mean.<br>
<br>
Just a thought to keep in mind.<br>

<br>
   I'm not asking for lower levels to plan a raid for themselves. From my limited experience, on the 2 raids I went on, having one or more higher levels dedicated to support a lower level group is essential. <br>
<br>
   In the last raid we had 2 groups; a high level group and a lower one. These 2 groups separated. This resulted in the lower group sending tells to the higher group for support. (Khoal mentioned this and I know I was also getting tells for buffs and Clarity as well) The end result was that the lower level group got wiped out followed by the upper one when the high level leader left to go help the lower one. <br>
  <br>
   The first one I went on was to Unrest, again with a group of higher levels and a group of lower levels. This time the higher levels spent the whole time overseeing the lower levels. I don't have a problem with this as long as that is the intention. <br>
<br>
   Until we reach a point where to 2 groups of different levels can function independantly of each other on a raid, I feel that a raid should be set for one level range per event.<br>
<br>
   Though I was unable to make the Mystic raid I like the fact that they stated ahead of time the level range for the raid. Higher levels would still be more than welcome but in a support role. <br>
<br>
   I have no problem playing the part of support on a lower level raid.  However, I don't want to go on a raid as part of a higher level group worrying the whole time about a lower level group. Or worse, worrying that our party may fall apart if members are leaving to help another group. This should be the exception not the expectation.   <br>
