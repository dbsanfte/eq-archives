Also if the time is not right I can be flexible with it and also can do it on Friday night if that would be more agreeable with all. Couple things I should point out, first all who take part will prob join me in being KOS in FP and Lucan is high 40's to 50 in lvl so keep that in mind, also Petra has agreed to help and will be off all weekend she said so it should go smoothly since she has pulled him numerous times or helped grps pull him numerous times. Please comment on who all will attend and if there is not enough to do it I will reschedule thanks.<br>

Aslo I do not want to go KOS in FP. So I may want to gate as soon as he starts to go down. (Say 1 red bubble left). I assume that would work okay?<br>

For killing Lucan, this is what happens.  I became KOS in these zones from helping Atacand with the SF quest.  The people in North Freeport love me though.  This is because the guards in WFP and EFP are corrupt, while the ones in NFP are not.  So, you will not go KOS to the guards in the zone with the bank.  There is a tunnel for entering NFP through WFP without passing by any guards, so if you take the faction hit and go KOS in those zones, let me know and I will show you how to use the tunnel system in WFP.<br>
<br>
I'd like to help out, so I'll plan to be there then, or earlier.  If possible, we should all be there on time.  I'd like to kill him ASAP because my roommates will most likely want to drag me out of the house to go out on Saturday night.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

  <br>
  Only question is then is how this affects raid for this weekend. MM is a dangerous plac and don't think it is a good idea to have raid if our higher levels will all be somewhere else. <br>
  <br>
  So canceled? Postponed? Changed to Friday or Sunday? <br>
 <br>
  We will need to let people know.<br>
<br>
  And while we are on the subject of Paladin quests, do you have your Ro Helm Val? I know you need 2 skulls from Giant Undead Cyclops. Picked up 3 this weekend with Leana, Eorgal and Kikaf. Will probably give 2 to Chan if she wants so she will have something since I feel she got shorted on the MM deal. That still leaves 1 one more and I can help you or other Pallys get more.<br>

I don't want to not include people but as I said enough people have died because or on my behalf and don't want any more bloodshed in my name so I ask only those who are comfortable with doing this to do so as I am very flexible in fact if we could do it tonight I would do it since no work for me tomorrow and this is something as Atacand can attest as well as Gira and the rest that I have been waiting a long time to fulfill, thanks for all the response and I appreciate all that has been done for me in the past, sometimes I don't say so but I truly do value all my friends and their willingness to help, thanks again.<br>

<br>
  You mentioned before you had a No Drop Werewolf talon. Do you still have it? <br>
<br>
  Kikaf got his Crafted BP but Allirog is also looking to get one since that is the only piece of Crafted armor he does not have for his alt Warrior character. <br>
<br>
  If you wouldnt mind, maybe we could get Allirog or another Wiz or Druid to port over to South Karrana to turn in and get BP. I have the 3 rubies needed and Allirog also said he would either buy or pay for rubies needed. All you have to do is turn in talon and 3 rubies (UNSTACKED) to Ulan Meadowgreen, a Centaur in the Centaur village near bridge and he will give you BP. <br>
<br>
  After our last outing in MM I feel this would be much faster and MUCH safer than trying to pull Gypsies/Werewolfs so someone else can get talon.<br>
<br>
Doesn't take long to do if you have a port.<br>
<br>
  Glad you have helm mold. I'm sure Gokulot or another Pally in guild can find a use for skull. We do have a few Pallys in guild.<br>

<br>
I have helped/lead a few Lucan raids.  If you need advice, or just want to hear me babble...give me a tell.<br>
<br>
It's hard to plan it..like you are..he's a 8 hour spawn.  And when he pops, it doesn't take long for someone to take him down.  <br>
<br>
One time the paly that we were raiding him for was there in FP camping in his room.  For HOURS.  He popped, a Mage and cleric and paly came in and said we are taking him and preceded to before we could all get there.<br>
<br>
It's good to plan it around when you know he's going to show.  Find out the last time he was killed (shouts in FP).  Time it, and plan it on a day that your going to be on for a few hours.  Have porters ready to go to FP as soon as he spawns...have an idea on who is in who's group and who is going to pull.<br>
<br>
All these things make for walking in, grouping, buffing, pulling, slaughter, with NO deaths.  We were very succesfull the last two times.<br>
<br>
Give me a tell and I'll fill you in on some secrets <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Long time since I have visited this board... yet it still feels welcome. At any rate, I will be there to help out and pull this filthy bastard, just a few things I will need. These ARE required as I am highly KOS and the guards will put me down fast if it doesnt go right...so, here we go... Need one non KOS person to hail him and keep him there at the EC zone after he is pulled. Need one KOS TANK to be at the NFP/EFP zone with sow and buffs up to pull all of the yard guards out of my way. At this point, I will go in and pull him out using both of my invulnerable spells. If you are standing at the gate of the city, facing out toward EC, I will pull him to the left of that all the way to the EFP/EC zone and zone out...this is where the non KOS person needs to be to hail him. All the rest, if yall are KOS, can be off elsewhere in the zone. The tank that pulled the rest of the guards out will go the other direction and zone out also. Once we are all back in, the ass whipping will commence. Last time I did it, was with one group, being a 47 pally, 52 tank, 50 enchanter, 51 ranger, and myself and he went down in about 1 minute with no troubles. Now having 53 Lucan pulls under my belt, I have found that this is the best way to pull him and the group I listed is prob the absolute minimum needed as all were pretty beat up at the end and me with 10 mana left. He needs to die fast tho. There is a 2 minute time that his cleric buddy will be with out him and then he will come looking for him to CH him... I will be on about 6-7 est tomorrow so if there are any questions feel free to ask me then. See yall later!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
