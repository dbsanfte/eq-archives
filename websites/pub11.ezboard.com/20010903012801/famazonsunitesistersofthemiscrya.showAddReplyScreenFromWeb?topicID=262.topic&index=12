<br>
She then felt his pressence fading,what a relief.<br>
<br>
But then,Hypnos had to go and do the eye thing,and her eyes diolated.She brought the back of her right hand up and blocked out the lights,what was he trying to do,blind her?She closed her eyes tightly,and fell to one knee,her left hand braced against the ground,a low growl escaping those crimson lips.She was getting a major headache,and surprisingly her alter ego had yet to take over,another relief.<br>
<br>
Well,this certainly has been quite a trip,next time,she'll take her own advise and stay in her happy little cave.<br>
<br>
Oh wait,lets try to make things interesting,shall we....<br>
<br>
And without further ado,she let out another growl,this one louder,and more threatening,and her hands balled up into tight fists,she stood up,and as she did so a spike of 12 inches in length,beginning from the wrists of each arm tears through her skin and running the length of her arms.And suddenly with great speed,she runs toward the large oak where Hypnos was,her left arm coming up across her chest,then jolted out and across the stem of the tree,slicing it clean in half and causing the large tree to thump to the ground.She then jerked her body back the other direction,and bringing both her arms up,fists inward,spikes out and crossed,she sets the very tip of the razor sharp spike directly at the throat of Hypnos,with a simple movement she could bring her arms down and embed the spike into the throat of the god.Not that it could do much damage,but her alter ego took surface and she was pissed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whats with the light show?&quot;She spoke angrily.<br>
<br>
Sure,Hypnos seemed to have been trying to do a nice thing,but to this side of her,it didnt matter.<br>

&quot;That hurt!&quot;She growled as she raised her head to look at Hypnos,who had by now fallen to the ground himself.And she rose up to her feet slowly as she blocked out the pain she was feeling.And again her hands were clentched into tight fists,her chest heaving as her breathing hardened,Oh yeah,she was mad.<br>
<br>
She wasn't one for giving up,even if she knew she could be defeated by a god,but not without a fight.And she decided close fighting with a god was out for now,so she looked down at the split rock she had smashed into.She leant over,and just as she did,the nuckles of her right fist were now armed with short 5 inch spikes on each of her 4 nuckles,and with a quick punching movement she took out a fist sized chunk of the stone,and then with the same movement did the same to the opposite side of the stone,making something we could call 'handles'.Once that was done,the spikes from her nuckles retracted,and she then grabbed hold of the stone by the two 'handles' she created in it.And with a strength passed down to her by her father (The Soverign)She lifted the large stone up,then with some effort she brought it over her head,then pushing her arms forward,she thrusted the heavy stone into the air,and across the field,in an attempt to have it land and crush the fallen Hypnos. <p>---Everybody Got a sanity------I've got a split personality---</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=hypnos>Hypnos </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 169<br> <font color=#993300>(8/14/01 11:39:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=262.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=C:\WINDOWS\Desktop\Stuff\hypnos.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Oooooooo</span><hr size=1> &quot; Just because I'm down doesn't meen I'm not defenseless...&quot; ***The large rock flys through the air and smashes into the ground right onto of Hypnos appearing that it smashed him...Then right behind Zelia a group of cobalts appear, with Hypnos standing behind them giving a weak grin...

Enough of attacking the Amazon Hypnos, it is pointless for one immortal to fight another. Nothing will be accomplished. ~she said through clenched teeth~ She didnt want your help and is on her way, as a protectress of the Amazons I bless her with a safe journey, which means you will fight me if needed...BUT LEAVE HER ALONE. She has persoanl demons she must face and if she asks for help, then you can help. But in the meantime, leave her be...<br>
