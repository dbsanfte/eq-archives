She had killed none, and been killed by no one. Her hand pulled the knife that had been thrust into her palm, out, and tossed it to the ground. Before slowly pushing up her war mask, up over her head. Her eyes had now returned to their emerald color, and inside she was distraught. This war had been nothing like she had ever wanted, or imagined. No glory or happiness had came to her blood lust. In fact she had grown soft.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Damn all those who wish failure upon the amazon nation.&quot;<br>

 Dawn growled, before whistling for her stallion. Once it came to her side, she just stood there, glancing over the field. Before letting out a long war cry, strong and proud.<br>

A few hours later, the last body, and the last soul were being taken care of. Apollo cooed in sorrow, it was such a shame what had come to pass here.

The room was empty and glowed brightly. Great pillars and mosaics adorned the great hall he was in. Gold plated floors made of marble looked to be freshly waxed and the sofa he lay on had many soft luxuriant pillows made of warm wool. Poseidon looked at his body and saw his fair skin was bruised yet mending. He had a splitting headache and his arm was numb and felt as if it were not there. The cool, temperate air was felt good to him. Poseidon carefully pulled himself up to sit up on the couch. Then he got up slowly and groaned as he did so. His strong, weary legs carried him over to a bubbling fountain from which water poured forth from the mouth of a golden stallion reared up on its hind legs. The chrystalline water shifted in tints until the vision of what was going on down below on earth appeared. The war was over and bodies were being recovered. The wounded helped with the dead and were being helped themselves. Poseidon sighed and shook his head. The error of his ways became apparent to him. He realized descisions should be made with care and for the good of all at that very moment as he looked on the destruction below. He knelt at the edge of the round fountain and leaned over the marble wall over the churning water. He brought his hand down slowly and shakily to the water. He stopped just short of the surface and  clached his hand tightly.::<br>

Standing there for a moment, his head fell to the side. He rarely saw these moments from Poseidon. These moments of self-regret. A smile found its way onto his face, and a tear in his eye. He walked to Apollo, his brown leather sandels slapping against the gold and marble floor. He placed a hand gently on Poseidon's strong shoulder. Apollo admired the powers of Poseidon, and though in many areas his power had exceeded that of his Uncle, his uncle had experience of millenniums.<br>
<br>
As Poseidon looked back to Apollo,with shimmering water-filled eyes, Apollo smiled. He sat down next to Poseidon, bringing his knees to his chest and wrapping his arms around them. For a moment they were silent. The silence saying what words could not, until Apollo spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do not be sorry.O, trident-bearing Earth-shaker. Do not regret anything you do, for if you regret it, you are implying you were wrong. And in life, there are no wrong answers. Just ones that produce negative, and positive reactions. Though you allowed Fogstone to shake your true beliefs, the basic belief we all have, that things should be solved without fighting. You had to do, what you thought was right.If by the will of Zeus, you remember anything I've ever told you. Remember that.To always do what you think is right, no matter how wrong others may thing it is. You have to live for yourself, and no one else.&quot; Apollo smiled to Poseidon, under the large fountain. Silence fell upon the two again. Apollo's eyes fell to the floor, his hand brushing over the golden tiles.<br>
<br>
&quot;You should get some rest. I will have Hermes tell Amphitrite you will be resting here on Olympus for the night. I will have a chariot ready to take you home in the morning. Now go rest.&quot; Apollo stood up, dusting off his tunic. He smiled to Poseidon and walked off, he had many things to do and the day was growing old. <p>      *~*The Golden God*~*

The blow from Poseidon threw her back and she wasn't able to get up in time to dodge the rising boulders. As they came back down, two trapped her body, and she wanted to fight this the mortal way. She would stay there until she herself would be able to be removed from the ruble.<br>
<br>
She was bruised and bleeding as most of them were, she was lucky to have gone up against such a God as Poseidon and cause harm, even pain against him. <br>
<br>
But the war was over . . . and there was no true victor. The Amazons Lived on, and the Gods couldn't die. <br>
<br>
Alysia finally pushed one of the boulders over and watched it topple and break upon another below. She sat up and glanced around and the blood soaked feild. Something about this reminded her of the wars of the Tretmolec. And how soon she would remember them more clearly.<br>
<br>
She stood up and whistled for her mare. As she glanced over the horizon at her sisters leaving for home, she saw in the distance a man. A man running away from her.<br>
<br>
And with that, she mounted her horse and rode towards the mountain ridge where he was headed . . . but would she return?<br>

Hypnos took off the toga and hung it up on a one of the silver hooks the surround the pool, and was left in a dark blue flap that covered his gentilia. Then then simply dived into the pool and layed at the bottom looking up as he let the warm water sooth his sore muscles. He then thought about the whole &quot;war&quot; regreting some of it, and then wishing he could have done more. But then agian the only deity that thought war was amusing was Ares, Athena, and Eris and who knows who else. But it was over now...*** <p>~*~*~*~*~Thè göd öƒ §|èèp ãñd Ïñspîrå†õñ.` ~*~*~*~*~

He began to walk through the field watching his step carefully. He sat on a destroyed chariot while wiping his wet blade across his thigh. He sheathed it on his back wipe watching the sun beginning to set. The screams of the wounded beginning to fade into silence as they were snuffed out by death, he always stayed waiting to see the cloaked figure. He had seen Valkyries come for his comrades when they fell, like a light that only those who had died could see. He expected to see the cloaked one as well, at least then he would be able to know him when he finally came for him. He slipped his hand into the pouch at his hip pulling a small flask of mead, he sipped it down as the sun began to fade on the battlefield. <br>

He stops once finding Zelia's body,Zel's head stopping beside him. He then raises his left hand as he does so Zelias body rises up from the ground,lifeless and stiff. He then looks down at Zels head and raises his right hand,doing so the head now floats into the air. He then returns his gaze to the body,while bringing his hands together,palms pressing firmly against each other. As he does this the head floats over to the body and rests upon the shoulders. &quot; There,much better.&quot; He lets his hands fall to his sides,but then Zelias head falls off her body and tumbles to the ground. &quot;Drat...I see a few stitches are in order.&quot; He then grabs up Zelias head by the hair,and placing his other hand on the shoulders of her body. A cloud of black smoke then envelopes himself and Zelias body and head then swirls around quickly then diappears as Dahak and dead Zel also disappear with him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/usheyala.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sheyala</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 328<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/27/01 4:38:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=258>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://geocities.com/Tokyo/Pagoda/8446/mononoke_poster.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ~War~</span><hr size=1> ::As the war came to an end, Shey remounted her horse ready to go home.

A bright spark shot from the bridle as the swords blade met the bridle,but the bridle did not break. Pegasus gets spooked for a moment but calms quickly.<br>

Bellerophon places his own weapon back in its sheath then removes the hood from his head and the mask from his face.<br>

Would you free any creature you've tamed and who conciders you thier master?&quot; He didn't wait around for an answer,the war was over and so was his battle with Sheyala.
