&quot;Good to have you back athelfi.&quot; She grinned and then turned looking at the wolves.<br>
<br>
&quot;Salvage what you can, and leave no man alive!&quot; She rose her daggers in the air and then charged at a fleet of Roman troops that came marching in from the woods. There were only about five of them, and they wore their symbol proudly. It disgusted her.<br>
<br>
Her dagger sunk into the chest of one as two others grabbed her arms pulling her backwards tieing her to a nearby tree. One of the guards came up to strike her but at her sight, his eye's widened.<br>
&quot;General Alysia?&quot; He quirked a brow.<br>
<br>
Alysia grinned darkly. There were always Romans everywhere, but this one happened to have been in her troop when she fought along side Livia many many many years ago.<br>
His pause gave her the opportunity to attack. Though her hands and arms were tied back behind her, she flipped her legs up around his neck, cracking it at the very first chance.<br>
Her fingers reached up behind her tearing at the ropes, and once again, she was free to kill.<br>

The ex military men, however, suddenly could not see very well.  <br>
<br>
The guardian sent her sword quickly across the thigh of the man to her left, spinning then the sword finding a home in the other's ribcage.  Picking her booted foot out of the thick muck of mud, she slammed it against his chest.  Pulling out her sword as he fell to the ground.  <br>

The first began to charge her, but it only led to her sword finding a home in his heart.  Marpe still had no expression as she ripped her sword out of the second man.<br>

Solari threw the roman sword at him, seeing it land its mark as it went thru his chest and reeling him backwards into the mud.<br>
She looked around her once more to see how many Romans were left fighting. upon seeing that their numbers were reduced to just a few, she gave the call, signaling that their attack was over with and for those few remaining Romans either be killed or taken as prisonares to be dealt with later. <br>
She walked back over to the Roman leader and made sure that the ropes were still tied tight around him. She walked over and picked up her war mask from the mud, shook it off, then placed it back on, feeling blood and mud mix on her face. <br>
Solari mounted up on her horse, looked around the village and noticed that there were shadowed faces staring at her from within the safety of huts. A few moments later, a woman and her children, a boy and girl, came out to stand before Solari's warhorse. <br>
<br>
&quot;Please, do not kill my son.&quot; She pleaded in her roman accent. <br>
<br>
Solari looked down at them, lifted up her mask and smiled softly. <br>
&quot;I have no desire to kill your son.&quot; She said softly. &quot;Your family will be safe now, if you so desire it.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daughterofshylock>Daughter of Shylock</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.picturesof.net/_wallpaper/rose_Dsc08151_WP.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 359<br> <font color=#993300>(5/5/03 11:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm66.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=213>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.picturesof.net/_wallpaper/rose_Dsc08151_WP.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Attack is over</span><hr size=1> The woman again turned back to the other young girls. She was not such a woman though. Her husband was one of the elder generals who bought her off of her Father when she was fourteen, and that was only three years ago.<br>
&quot;Don't you fools get it? We're free!&quot; She yelled.<br>
<br>
However, her general husband came up behind her grabbing her around the neck. &quot;I wouldn't get so ahead of yourself Tahira!&quot; He growled.<br>
<br>
Alysia turned her wolf eyes back towards the scene and narrowed her eyes. She shouted out and tossed the young girl a dagger.<br>
<br>
The other women screached and ducked, but as soon as the blade was in sight, Tahira caught it and jammed it into the chest of her Roman husband. Soon, the General dropped to the floor and Tahira stood over the body narrowing her eyes down at it. With a swift kick, she hit him in the ribs and turned her eyes to the dagger that had a white wolf imprinted on the hilt. <br>
Her eyes turned upwards to where Alysia was looking at her.<br>
<br>
Alysia grinned a bit and looked back to Odessa.<br>
&quot;This one's comming to Scynthia.&quot; She smirked a bit and then looked back to her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come on girl. Come enjoy freedom.&quot;<br>
<br>
With a grin, the girl smiled and left the hut following Alysia into the woods.<br>
The Scynthian Queen turned back and shouted to her wolves.<br>
<br>
&quot;Anything that's wounded, kill it. Any Roman that's alive, bring them to deal with later.&quot;<br>
<br>
Needless to say, the Scynthian wolves ended up taking only three Romans back to the lands. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">~*~ Jessica ~*~<br>

The girl looked around at all the amazons and then back to Alysia.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are all of you wives of Romans?&quot; She asked.<br>
<br>
Alysia laughed. <br>
&quot;I'd shoot myself in the chest with a crossbow before I'd ever allow any of my sisters to do such a thing. These are amazons, Queens and Warriors of the entire Nation. We came to free our sisters.&quot;<br>
<br>
The girl smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I can't speak for us all, but I'm grateful for your sacrifice.&quot;<br>
<br>
Alysia looked back as she saw the three romans unconscious, tied to nearby trees, her wolves gaurding them and getting ready to take them back to Scynthia. Alysia looked up to Solari and Hippolyte.<br>
<br>
&quot;Anything I can do to help the pain Hipp?&quot; She held out her hand and a golden light emerged from it. Alysia was the Amazon Goddess of healing, but she usually asked knowing that some of the Amazons actually liked to heal the mortal way. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">~*~ Jessica ~*~<br>

She turned in her saddle to see Elektra nearby. She motioned for her to join her. <br>
&quot;Elektra, I see that you are still blood thirsty.&quot; She said quietly. &quot;Any Roman soldier that is not already captured, is yours to torment as you see fit.&quot; <br>
<br>
She turned back to look at the family before her, then at the others that were joining the mother and her children. She noticed that the Roman commander she had was coming too. Cursing and spitting blood out onto the ground as he struggled to his feet. Solari jerked on the rope that held his hands together behind his back, causing him to fall to his knees once more. <br>
<br>
&quot;You witch.&quot; he growled as he sat on his knees. &quot;I will kill you for this.&quot; <br>
<br>
Solari looked down at him, with one swift motion, her boot met with his nose, breaking it and sending him backwards once more into the mud. She heard a gasp of a child, which made her turn back to the families standing there.<br>
&quot;Your families are safe from our wrath. We have gotten what we came for. If you wish sanctuary within our city, join us. If you wish to return to Rome, do so now.&quot; She said in a commanding, but gentle voice. &quot;You are all free now.&quot; <br>
<br>
She jerked the rope once more, sending the Roman forward into the rear of her horse. Laughter from the children erupted as the Roman cursed under his breath. Solari gathered the reins and turned her horse around. She nodded to Elektra to signal that she was leaving and to carry out what ever orders she wished upon the wounded Romans that lay around. As Solari rode out of the village, the Roman tugged on his rope, trying desperatly to hide his face from the stinging mud that was being flung at him by the women and children. The call to return to the encampment was given, and just as quickly as the amazons appeared, they disappeared into the darkness save for a select few remaining in the village to &quot; clean-up. &quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alexiares>Alexiares</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#993300>(5/8/03 8:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm66.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=220>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/queenhippolyte/images/alexiares.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Attack is over</span><hr size=1> Hearing Marpe's orders, Alexiares began to wander near the woods to forage for things they could eat.
