It had been a hard thing to do..burning the old one down.  But, it had needed to be cleansed of the negative energy that had built up within.  And now.. in it's place stood a new structure.  A tavern for the Themiscryans to meet those from the outside world.  The LABRYS had always stood far from the village of Themiscrya.  On the outer edge of Themiscryan lands, it was a well known place for a good time, spars, drinks, or a relaxing soak in the hot tub.  <br>
Today, had been a day of hot and hard work.  As Dawn, Ariah, Hippolyte, and other amazons labored to rebuild this well known tavern.  And like a phoenix it stood reborn.  Hipp looked to Ariah proud:: I think it looks even better then before!  ::chuckles:: all it needs now.. is a few spars!  I am sure the Themiscryans are up to that.  :: Ariah and Dawn chuckled over the Queen's words.  They all knew it would not take long for a spar to start up in the tavern, and for a chair to be broken.  Thank the Gods, there were some great carpenters in the tribe.  Hipp saluted the stucture:: May the Gods bless you, LABRYS.  And may you be home to all women...and a place for friends to meet!   <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

Anyway, I was at the opening ceremonies of the tavern with my fiance, Joxer -- I'm sure you all know him -- and I had a great time. The cannonball contest was a lot of fun, even though I think I got sick.. ::chuckles, then coughs:: I'm glad to see the tribe thriving so. I'll work hard to gain more experience points.

The rain comes down and beats upon her dark auburn hair, brown face, and cloak that she holds tightly around her body. She leans against a tree...hearing the joyous voices within.  A soft smile almost finds her face.  Suddenly, she hears footsteps..and sinks deeper into the protective leaves of the tree.  She watches as a small boy runs giggling into the tavern.  She watches as he pushes the door open.  Inside she can see women...dressed as warriors. Or did she.....she second guesses herself.  <br>
Hours pass and still find her huddling against the tree..she watches.  She has seen a few men..and several women pass, going in and out of the tavern.  She has become curious at the site of that most of the women are dressed as warriors.  They remind her of the warrior named Livia who she fought against in Rome.  But, surely these could not be Romans.  Not this far.<br>
As the rain pounds down upon the tree above her..and then beats upon her..the almost thoroughly soaked woman watches still silent.  Having almost become one with the tree.  <br>
Then a figure dressed in purple and burgandy slip out of the tavern.  Ara stops her breath..watching.::: <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uarahutajiwarli.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arahuta Jiwarli</A> at: 9/26/00 11:27:37 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://hometown.aol.com/queenhippolyte/BC.html BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Vasilissa</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#993300>(9/26/00 11:53:37 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> As the celebration moves into the night</span><hr size=1> :::Hippolyte stepped out of the tavern..and looked up at the heavens.

Says her goodbyes again...and then wrapping herself up..she walks out to her mare. She smirks as the rain begins to slow to a spitting drizzle and chuckles:: Well..Zeus..you do listen to women after all..don't you?  :::  She then looks to her mare and just as she places her hands upon the saddle..she stops.  Her senses telling her she is being watched.  She slowely turns her head..scanning the edge of the forest that surrounds the LABRYS.  Knowing the every bend of the trees that surround the LABRYS, after all these years...her eyes notice that one tree..is a bit wider then usual.  Her hands pull off the saddle and one moves to her scimitar..resting her palm on the pammel beneath her cloak.  She begins a slow..deliberate walk towards the form.  Her eyes narrow..trying to see the form thru the rain::: <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://hometown.aol.com/queenhippolyte/BC.html BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10> at: 9/26/00 12:47:51 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uarahutajiwarli.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arahuta Jiwarli</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#993300>(9/26/00 12:04:48 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.facelink.com/arahutajiwarli?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: As the celebration moves into the night</span><hr size=1> ::: Ara watches as the figure moves towards her. By now, she has seen that this was one of the warrior women in the tavern.  She sighs and breathes a quiet deep breath.

She shows she has no weapon in her hands.  Her heart beating quickly.  Even though, Ara knew how to spar and fight with the best of them.  She sought and tried peaceful ways. In a soft voice she spoke a word she hoped this warrior knew.:::<br>

Suddenly, behind the other woman, three more came out of the tavern and into the now lighty drizzeling night. Their eyes went straight for Ara. With that..she turned and darted into the night. She raced thru the bushes and trees like a doe with wolves behind her. She ran up the face of a mountain, until she found a rocky craig and slid her body within. Her breathing hard...she prayed for the rock spirits to hide her from the women below. Eventually, her breath quietened and the shaman listened.::: <br>
