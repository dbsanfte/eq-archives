Record of the<br> Amazons lie also with the Ukrainians, the Chinese, the Scythians, Hittites,<br> and Indians, to name a few. The Amazon Nation consisted of a federation of<br> numerous all women tribes from two groups : women who left their villages<br> temporarily for service to their Goddess, and women who preferred an all<br> female society. This was not considered harmful or unusual. Amazons and<br> priestesses often formed the backbone of medical and teaching personnel in<br> communities. A wide variety of scientific knowledge was preserved in the<br> context of ritual and systems of divination. Bearing children was the task of<br> a warrior, given how physically dangerous it was to mother and child.<br> Symbolically, the mother acts as a human gateway between the worlds when<br> giving birth, an extremely dangerous occupation demanding careful<br> precautions. <br> At the time that Amazon tribes began to form, the primary deity was a<br> Goddess, usually identified as the Lady of Beasts, the Bird Goddess, or the<br> Snake Goddess, categories developed by Dr. Marija Gimbutas. This was<br> particularly true of the Amazons, and is reflected in all mythology<br> concerning them. Perhaps then, the easiest way to trace the Amazons is to<br> begin with their Goddesses, given the origin of their tribes in dedicated<br> religious colleges in North Africa and Anatolia approximately 10 000 years<br> ago. <br> In the Myrine entry of Chapter One, two Goddesses of the Libyan Amazons were<br> described: Sipylene of the Moon and Sea, and Athena of the Sun. In fact,<br> there was a third Goddess worshipped in the area, by a tribe of Amazons later<br> known as the Pallantids. This was Pallas Promachos (Pallas of the Vanguard),<br> whose mere shadow appeared in Athens later. The Pallantids eventually became<br> hereditary enemies <br> of Athens, after the raids which broke the treaties signed after the Attic<br> War. <br> The first recorded encounters between Greek and Amazon tribes occur in North<br> Africa. Few authors make clear that the Libyan Amazons were black, and that<br> so too must be Athena, Pallas, and Sipylene. They may have helped inspire<br> divine female figures who have black skin in European folklore, apart from<br> chthonic Goddesses who are black due to their connection with the soil. The<br> other source is ancient India, homeland of the Goddesses Sera 'army' and Uma<br> 'light' or 'Moon.' Sera seems to have been predominantly a war Goddess, but<br> Uma became Goddess of the Moon, war, and wisdom. Uma's name may be the root<br> of the term 'Amazon' from Uma-zoon, often translated 'Moon Warriors.' Amastis<br> on the Black Sea may also be named for her, suggesting that Amazons there<br> were her worshippers. Sera's followers were settled on the Gulf of Amnissus. <br> The migration of Indian Amazons occurred early, probably corresponding to the<br> invasions that destroyed the Harrapan civilization (approximately 2000 BCE).<br> They established early Northern Amazon settlements, and seem to have made<br> contact with the Libyan Amazons, whose Gorgon Goddess bears points of<br> resemblance to Kali. <br> At last to the Greeks, who believed that all Amazons were descendants of Ares<br> through Harmonia. Harmonia is a title of Aphrodite, whose warlike aspect was<br> more commonly known as Galatea. She comes from the Middle East originally,<br> and may be related to Astarte. Paphos was originally an Amazon colony, which<br> suggests that Aphrodite's warrior women brought her there. Still other<br> Amazons were from Anatolia and Crete, as evidenced by their worship of<br> Artemis, Cybele, Rhea, and Gaea. All of these and Aphrodite were worshipped<br> as Lady of the Beasts and warrior Goddess. Athena was different. A descendant<br> of the Bird Goddess of Neolithic times, that was also her aspect among the<br> Gorgons. The golden Sun eagle was originally one of her forms. Marija<br> Gimbutas demonstrated that the Bird and Snake Goddesses were always together<br> in Neolithic Old Europe6 . Eventually this was expressed as the combination<br> of Athena and Hera, whose temples were always placed near each other. In<br> Libyan Amazonia, the Snake Goddess was another as<br> pect of Athena herself rather than a separate Goddess, although Greek writers<br> later interpreted this <br> aspect as the Goddess they called Hera. <br> The Amazons of Old Europe saw their Bird Goddess replaced wholesale by a<br> version of Athena as foreign to their Libyan counterparts as she was to them,<br> and their own Snake Goddess rewritten into an enemy. Daughter of Rhea, who<br> wielded the silver Moon sickle of Time, Hera wielded the labrys in defense of<br> her Amazons, the blows manifesting on earth as bolts of lightning.<br> Eventually, she sent her daughter Heraklaea to defend her people, an idea<br> that impressed the Dorian Greeks so much they masculinized her and<br> substantially rewrote her labours. <br> It was this diverse group of people that created a confederation that<br> influenced a huge territory that at its <br> largest extended from North Africa to the Danube. The Greek tribes that<br> eventually encountered them had <br> already institutionalized the fear of women, firm in the belief that men were<br> defenseless in the face of a women's revolt. Their first engagements with the<br> Amazons did nothing to disabuse them of the notion. Between the devastatingly<br> effective Amazon cavalry to their skilled use of warcries that froze or<br> panicked the Greeks so completely that the men thought themselves bewitched,<br> they served as proof of the point. This and the refusal by Amazons to submit<br> to male authority led to an obsessive determination to destroy them. Efforts<br> at destruction proved to be in vain. When the Amazons were finally pushed out<br> of their homelands, they fled back to the Nation's roots in Tunis and<br> Morocco, and then moved West and North through southern Spain. The Valkyries<br> were a Northern European Amazon tribe. As late as the 18th <br> century, Medieval histories recorded that Amazons ruled Ulm until the time of<br> Alexander in a reign spanning thousands of years. Later historians believed<br> that Amazon customs only persisted until the 18th century, an interesting<br> congruence. That this is blatantly untrue can be seen at the all women<br> festivals still held annually on Giresun Adesi, formerly called Aretias on<br> the Black Sea, the tradition of women only gatherings under the auspices of<br> 'tea' or 'crafts,' or the banding together of women for common cause. Present<br> day movements such as lesbian separatism and women only religious space are<br> further reclamations of those customs. <br><br>From:  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.amazonation.com/Origins&Geo.html">www.amazonation.com/Origins&Geo.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>  <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>www.sistersofthemiscrya.com</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://hometown.aol.com/queenhippolyte/spinningsword.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10> at: 10/19/00 4:13:39 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm9.showPrevMessage?topicID=2.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm9.showNextMessage?topicID=2.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm9.emailToFriend?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm9.threadControl?topicID=2.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm37">The Mythical Odyssey Forum<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitefrm32">The Mythical Odyssey<option value="amazonsunitefrm35">Amazon Nation Alliance<option value="amazonsunitefrm33">Character Descriptions<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm30">Amazons of the Sacred Circle<option value="amazonsunitefrm34">Amazons of Lesvos Island<option value="amazonsunitefrm38">High Mountain Tiger Clan<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm31">Amazon Language<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals<option value="amazonsunitefrm39">Guild Applications<option value="amazonsunitefrm40">Sisters of Chadesia</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm9>Amazon History and Myth</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
