It instantly began to flow back to a random spot in her temple, flowing up and forming a figure of a woman.  The water materialized into Amphitrite.  Long tendrils of a dark hue fell across her shoulders covering the sleeves of her loose fitting satin dress of a midnight blue hue.  The dress cascaded down her body belling out onto the floor of Artemis's temple.<br>
<br>
The Sea Goddess stood as still as calm waters as she awaited Artemis's presense.  Her silver blue occulars scanned across the temple, looking for her, because she had a question about the Amazons. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goddessartemis>Goddess Artemis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Virgin Huntress</span><br>  Posts: 422<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(12/11/02 12:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=289.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Greetings</span><hr size=1> As she sat in her throne, feet up on a dias, scrolls in her lap and sprawled on the floor, she felt the presence of another God. She glanced up and watched the puddle of water form into a figure. A smile spread on her face asn she put the scrolls aside and stood up. Stepping from the trone platform, she walked to the figure, waiting for it to become a full form, when it did she nodded.<br>
<br>

The Goddess took one step towards Artemis, a pale slinder foot peaked out from behind the bottom of her dress, instantly being hidden when she brought her other foot back to it's side.  Her indigo occulars drifted off to the side as she attempted to decide how to put her thoughts into words.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is just as good to see you as well, Artemis.  I have a few questions about your women, your Amazons.  They have been interesting me for quite sometime.  During my travels, when I was in the Mediterranion, I noticed a few of their tribes along my shores.  Their customs, crafts and most certainly their courage has struck something inside of me, which I'm sure it does to any woman who does not know their heritage; Goddess or no.  Please enlighten me about them, I would also love to be apart of their customs, if that is possible.&quot;<br>
<br>
She quickly returned her occulars to Artemis, with the warm smile remaining on her lips.  She hopped that her words had not offended the Goddess in any way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=poseidonkofc>Poseidonkofc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 343<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(12/18/02 5:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=289.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.madasafish.com/~whitewitch/posgallp1_whodidit.htm WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Watcher</span><hr size=1> Another pool of water appeared on the floor of the temple, faint and barely noticable. At first it lay there in stillness till it began to flicker and a face appeared flatly on its surface. The bright eyes danced around and looked about the surrounding area. The face then disappeared and the small pool of water seemed to shrink into itself. It had become a dark brown roach which skurried over toward the goddesses keeping near to the base of the strong wall.<br>
<br>
It had stopped when it felt is was close enough. As the goddesses talked it listened and as it listened the roach crawled up the wall, above the heads of the goddesses. There it remained and stretched out its wings. <p>Poseidon~Lord of the Deep Blue Sea~Patron Of Horses And Sailors~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goddessartemis>Goddess Artemis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Virgin Huntress</span><br>  Posts: 426<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(12/19/02 12:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=289.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Amazons</span><hr size=1> She smiled as the amazons were brought up. Her race of women. Artemis never had children of her own, and never will for that matter, but to her, the amazons, all amazons were her children, firece warrior women that she would protect.<br>
<br>
Offering a seat to Amphitrite, she sat in her own moonstone throne, a pleased smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;Many wonder the origin of the amazons, but I can assure you, only few know. Tho it is true that my brother Ares has fathered many, many amazons. Not all Amazons come from Greece...and those who do not, do not worship us Greek Gods. Tho, they have heard of myself and Hera and Ares, they have a respect for us, but have there own Gods with there own names....<br>
<br>
I have a feeling that even when this race of warriors dies out, and hopefully, that will not be any time soon, that there stories and legends will be told and never forgotten. Even my stepmother, Hera, has Amazon kin. The Queen Hippolyte, founder of Themiscrya.<br>
<br>
There customs are simple. Live Free... They farm there land for food, hunt and fish for there meats. There lives revolve around justice for women. They proved to all that would think it not to happen, that women, in all there rights, are equal, and sometimes better then men. They do not need the hand of man to tell them what to do, or how to live......&quot; She tried to think what else to tell about, but she can go on for hours about the amazons, talking people to death or just bordom...<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you have a certain, or specific question about the amazons...Might be quicker that way.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled, feeling the presence of something in the air...something, but what? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goddessamphitrite>Goddess Amphitrite</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(12/23/02 11:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=289.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/xvamphitritevx/images/amphitrite1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Amazons</span><hr size=1> She greatly took the seat that was offered and listened intently as Artemis spoke.  A faint smile held it's place on her lips.  She shifted her position once during the Goddess's answer, resting her upper body on her crossed legs.  Tiny crustaceans were left as a temporary mark, but quickly faded away with the seconds.<br>
<br>
A light laugh escaped her smiling lips, &quot;Just to reasure you, you weren't boring me, but the quickest way is always the best.  Anyway, I was wondering is there any way I could be apart of their world as well.  I'm not asking for a temple or anything like that, it's just the femininity is drawing me in.&quot;<br>
<br>
She sat back into her seat once again, awaiting the Virgin Huntress's answer.  But in the corner of her eyes she caught a brown creature crawling on the ceiling.  She turned her faded blue occulars glance upon it.  Normally she wouldn't be drawn to gaze upon a creature of small proportion, but she was.  With that, she knew it could only be one God: her husband, Posiedon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goddessartemis>Goddess Artemis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Virgin Huntress</span><br>  Posts: 427<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(12/23/02 2:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=289.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/mogoddessartemis/images/triplemoon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Amazons</span><hr size=1> ~She smiled~ <br>
 I am sure some of the amazons allready keep you in mind. You are a Goddess of the Sea, Some amazons use the sea and its fish alot. Take the Lesvos Amazons and there Queen Velaska, Ares Daughter. There fortress is on the northern tip of the island, they use the ocean, streams, ponds, alot. They have a warm spring in a cavern beneath there fortress.<br>
<br>
I know De'Lerium of Themiscrya always keeps an alter to each of the Greek Gods and Goddesses. She is very loyal to all of us. <br>
<br>
Now, the Northern Amazons, they do not worship the Greek Gods because, they aren't greek...Something some of the male ego's around here cannot contimplate.... <p>~ The Silver Goddess~&lt;br&gt;<br>

A smile fell across her face as Artemis helped her realize that she was a part of the Amazon's life.  She brought her pale and cold hand up and pulled each dark lock off of her neck and dropping it on her back and quickly brought her hand back to her lap.<br>
<br>
&quot;I apologise that I am troubling you with all these questions about your warrior women.  I promise that this is my last one.  Are some Goddesses allowed to join a few of the Greek Amazon tribes?&quot;<br>
<br>
Her greyblue occulars fell one Artemis's face as she awaited her answer, pushing each thought about her husband in the cockroach form to the back of her head.<br>
