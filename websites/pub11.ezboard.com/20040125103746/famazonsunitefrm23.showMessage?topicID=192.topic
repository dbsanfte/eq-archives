Two large men, guards, stood, wearing nothing but leather pants, boots and black leather collers. In there hands, spears. As you walked inside, you notice, nothing but black, the floors and pillars are made of a black marble, as is the alter by the far wall. Tapestries depicting battle scenes hang on the walls. In a heap on the floor are dead bodies of the guards who allowed her temple to be trashed the first time. Large leopards and black panthers sit, licking up the blood, devouring the tasty meat of the men.<br>
<br>
On the top of a long staircase, sits a throne made of black cast iron. It's red velvet backboard trimmed nicly in the metal.<br>
<br>
Sitting upon that throne, Eris, Goddess of Discord, with a smug smirk on her face as she watches some going-on's though her reflecting pool. Her black eyes dance as she watches. By her feet sat one of her diciplines, his back and chest all scratched up, as well as bi marks all over his neck, however, a satisfied look sat on his face. He felt very gratefull for pleasing his goddess the way he did.<br>
<br>
She shifted in her seat and crossed her legs as she kept her eyes on the relecting mirror.:::<br>

His attension then turned to the young man entering the room. Apollo's eyes sized him up, picking apart ever little imperfection on the boy's body.
