It was rare that they saw this one not on horse back. Something she usually did her morning rounds of the forests of Themiscrya, riding proudly and cautiously.<br>
But, this was the evening.  And the auburn haired woman seemed to be deep in thought...not noticing the world around her.<br>
Brown eyes glance up as she nears the edge of the dark forests.  Beyond she can see the smaller river that at one time, the amazons left bundles of male infants at.  She stopped near a tree and leaned her back against it...still hidden within the forest.  Her eyes glance along the banks....and she softly sighs. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A> at: 6/27/01 7:05:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uhippolyte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Vasilissa</span><br>  Posts: 365<br> <font color=#993300>(6/27/01 7:16:09 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/hipprpg.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Quiet walk</span><hr size=1> As her eyes run down the river, she thinks of the village of Gargarensia.  Her brow raises as she thinks of the village of men.  For several years now, she had left alone the place she and the Themiscryan's once had "terrorized".  She thought a bit more about the past ...and then frowned.  For some reason, she had decided to stop the raids upon the Gargarensians.  And never did she know why.  It had just felt right. <br>
Slowely, Hippolyte pushed her body from the tree and walked out into the clearing near the small river.  Fingers reached up and brushed back a loose strand of wavy hair..pushing it behind one ear.  <br>
Arms crossed in front, Hipp walked up to the riverbank.  The river gurgled over the pebbles that could be seen underneath the shallow waters. Kneeling down, she reached out and touched the cold liquid.  Still with her hand in the water...Hipp's eyes turned towards the village of men.  <br>
<br>
(P.S. Hercules and the Amazon Women..time had been changed in the end of the film. and thusly, Hipp does not recall the events.) <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>

&quot;You do not remember athelfi? I mean, it is not a tradition of the Northern Amazons, but here it was nothing more close to a ritual, a ceremony here.&quot;<br>
<br>

It was the only way we could have our daughters.  That was all we needed of them.  And they were a village of men for good reason.  Their women left and sought refuge with the Amazons of Themiscrya.  For they had been beaten and disrespected in many ways.  We took them in...and taught them the amazon path....&quot;<br>
Hipp's thoughts over took her again as she watched the river flow near her feet.  <br>
&quot;Why we stopped....I do not know,&quot; she shrugged her shoulders slightly. &quot;We just did...and then life went on.  We became to busy in other things to pursue the thoughts of why the raids stoppped.  Centuars were attempting to take our forests again.  And...then...well...during all that..some amazons found ways to become with child.  And the village began to be reborn.&quot;<br>

Sadly, she too knew how the lack of males brought things upon amazon villages. <br>
<br>
&quot;A long time ago, there were two villages. A village of women and a village of men. The village of women were strong and independant, and the village of men were weak and absent minded. The men came to the women's village and attacked it one day, burning it to the ground, destroying every living creature within it.&quot;<br>
<br>
She sighed and paused for a brief moment.<br>
<br>
&quot;The village of women perished quickly, but so did the men for they had forgotten the importance of the women in their lives. And they too died in peril.&quot;<br>
<br>
Alysia's words of wisdom came from the Tretmolec within her, as Samsara she was a great leader, and as Alysia, she was a compassionate sister. The two of them made a great pair.<br>
