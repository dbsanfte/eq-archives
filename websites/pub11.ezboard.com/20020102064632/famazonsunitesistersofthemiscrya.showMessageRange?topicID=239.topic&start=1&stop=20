 Walking back through village Dawn had stopped in her hut, and changed into a pale pink dress from Greece, and around the inner side of her thigh, she had sheathed a knife, it was slender and smooth enough to be just like it was the flesh. All weapons were removed except for it, and elven boots laced tighter, so that the sheathes were gone. <br>
<br>
 Then the Amazon set back out into the village, going to the High Council meeting hut...following Hippolyte's directions, Dawn found the old map. Rolling it up, and tying a red ribbon around it, Dawn left. <br>

&quot;No, We shouldn't ask her to send anyone else. Doing such may cause havoc. The men will know who we are then, and fighting may break out. We don't want that. If we're discovered, it will only be us. We can't let the men know we are Amazons. Calling in Athelfi will tell them that. Our escape, if needed, must depends solely on us. The rafts will take us past Themiscrya if we are forced to use them, making the men think we've come from farther down the riverbank, a different part of the land. When we dock the raft, we can destroy the one we used. We'll then weave our way through the land, in case they've sent scouts after us. We can confuse them with fake trails heading south of the village, then take to the trees when the time comes and return to the village that way.&quot;<br>

Hiking up that pink skirt again, she went to the hut with the pigeons. Picking up a pure white one in a cage, Dawn turned. Walking to Hippolyte's hut.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Guard please tell Queen Hippolyte, Sartha and I are leaving.&quot;<br>
<br>
 The guard dissappeared inside, and Dawn went to find Sartha at the rafts. <p>Pyschotic injustice
Mommy made me this way
Evil and hungry
I'm just a craving soul
Craving for your blood and death; M'Dear
Don't worry it won't hurt..
Just a dagger or two.. 
Crimson spilling onto my hands..
Running over the flesh to drip from my elbow
Scarring the black leather pants..
Mmmm its yummy
Don't worry I only strike once...
Don't bother to scream... they won't catch me

A few villagers moved about slowely working on their every day tasks.  Small boys played in the streets with wooden swords and balls, or just chasing each other.  While the men sat and talked of the passing days events or  their women.  As one looked at the villagers who were moving about working on their tasks, you could see they were women.  Women carrying water, tending to drying meat, working on cloth looms, and wait....Some of these women were very short.  There were young girls working beside the women.  As one woman walked by a group of men, she was swatted on the backside.  Without a look to him, she continued to take her basket of bread down the road.  But, unlike most villages, the number of women was far less then men.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 225<br> <font color=#993300>(7/15/01 1:25:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The leave</span><hr size=1>  Dawn had made it to the rafts only to find a letter from Sartha telling her that she had went on ahead to the village, and placed the rafts in the designated spots they chose on the map.  <br>
<br>
 With that Dawn took the pigeon out of its cage, setting it on her shoulder. Fingers wound around the pink dress skirt as she hiked it up and began walking into the forest. It was time to go meet the villagers of Gargarensia...<br>
