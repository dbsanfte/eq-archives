She cries:*<br>
<br>
Areto, ARETOOOO!If you hear me, please come, it's me, Daphnike...<br>
<br>
* But the Vasilissa doesn't come.As she understand that the tribe have been slaughtered by a band of warlords, she cries wildly after cutting lightly her hand palm with her sword, shedding scarlet drops on the soil:*<br>
<br>
I swore on my blood that your murders will be avenged dear athelfi, I promise that vultures will soon feast on your murderors corpse and that the fire of my hate against them will be the one of their funeral pyres!Rest in peace my athelfi...<br>
<br>
AAAAAresSSSS, father!Where are you !!!! I need your help, more than ever.<br>
<br>
*She gallops on her stallion to the mountains. But at that moment, the band of assassins comes from the mountains and charges the young Amazon while saying*<br>
<br>
For Krykus!<br>
<br>
* And Daphnike, with no fear, taking her sword from her scabbard charges them while saying:*<br>
<br>
For Areto!For the Sisters of The Crimson Stone!For the Amazon Nation! <br>
<br>
* Fighting like a fury, the Amazon defeat all the enemies who dare to attack her, dodging the arrows coming in her way. The warlords begin to feel respect for the fierce Amazon, who fight them with heroism and to be afraid, as they see the young, solitary Amazon killing their best warriors.Even circling didn't worked, as Daphnike, as a great master of combat making a turn on herself cut their throat with her sword.She gallops away, ranges her sword, take her bow and an arrow and shoots the warlord who looks like to be leader of the band, successfully.The warlord, hitten right in the heart fell from his horse, mortally wounded and the surviving members of the band surrender to the Amazon.*<br>
<br>
* Daphnike, suddenly feels blood flowing from her neck.Animated by the fierce battle, she didn't felt the sword's cut.Weakened by her wound, the Amazon falls on the ground.Rather than to kill her, the bandits take her to their camp and heal her.Amazed by her courage and fighting skills, the bandits decided to make her their chief . *<br>
<br>
* Coming to kill them, the young Amazon Daphnike is now destined to become Queen of the Bandits she pursued and to live in their camp, in the Caucasus, trapped in that wasteland. She found herself dressed in a colourful,Persian style dressed, her head covered by a turban.A bandit says her*<br>
<br>
Don't try to escape or you'll know the same fate as your friends.Know that we have no pity for your race, Amazon and that we'll kill you like a rat if you try to betray us.You're an amazing and fearless warrior  but your temerity will send you to your loss.If we decided to let you live, it's because we need a skilled and fearless warrior to lead our band, because you could be useful to us.I recognize you, it's you the young Amazon from Themiscrya that I shot in the woods.Looks like you're too strong for the Parques.When do you'll decide to die!?You made all that way to avenge.We could make you a legend, if you decide to become our Queen.Which Empire do you want to conquer first, Rome. To spread terror at Rome and become a legend or to die by our hand.I think the choice is easy<br>
<br>
Daphnike:Even if you give me Rome, I'll never be your ally.<br>
<br>
* Suddenly she feels a swordsblade on her neck,The bandit says her*<br>
<br>
You're now trapped Amazon,I'll be your worst nightmare if you try your little rebellion again.You have a bad temper but I'll tame you and believe me, you'll be a lot more docile.You don't have water in your blood.I'll be able to animate your vengeful spirit and you'll become mine.I'm Kiarus and trust me, I'll be your end.<br>
<br>
Daphnike( interiorly while looking the horizon)Themiskyra, Mother...Hippolyte...I'll escape,I'll return home,I'll return home<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Past a good night Queenie!* laughs*My band decided to make you their Queen and to leave the Amazons in peace but I'll pursue your Nation as long as I'll live.Don't be worried, I'lln't kill you.But I'll leave you there while going to your village and murder your Queen.And you...wait for someone who'll free you from your ties* diabolic laugh*<br>
<br>
* Kiarus rides his horse to Themiskyra while Daphnike tries to free herself.The young warrior remembers that she had hidden a dagger in her right boot.She tries to move her feet and gripping to the tree, she high up her feet to make the dagger fall on the ground.When she successes,she holds the dagger between her feet and begins to cut the ties emprisoning her hands.After she successes,she takes the dagger, cuts the ties emprisoning her feet, put the dagger in her scabbard than range it in her boot, seeks her bow and her horse while seeing that Kiarus killed all the bandits who were loyal to her. She mounts her horse,grabbing the reins with her left hand, her sword with her right one and gallops away to Themiscrya.Skilled horsewoman,Daphnike overtakes him miles north of Sarmatia.<br>
<br>
*The young Amazon warrior draws her sword while pushing a fierce warcry.A fierce,long and bloody combat begins, in a succession of blows and parries. Skilled warrior,Kiarus successes to hit Daphnike's left arm after a long combat and she falls from her horse, losing her sword. She touches her wound, her hand covers by blood.All moves from her body are painful...Kiarus comes down from his horse and puts the end of his sword on Daphnike's throat while saying:*<br>
<br>
It's now your time to die, I never had so much difficulty to kill an Amazon but now, it's your time to meet the Parques and to meet your friend, Areto on the other side.<br>
<br>
* At that time, Daphnike's takes her dagger from her boot and stabs him right in the heart.She saws the warlord fall on the ground, mortally hitten,bleeding profusely and says:*<br>
<br>
Your reign of terror is now ended Kiarus and the Sisters of the Crimson Stone are now avenged.Make your salutations to Hades with my consideration and may the vultures feast on your rotten heart...<br>
<br>
Kiarus: Be...damned...Amazon...be...damned...*he agonizes and dies*<br>
<br>
* Daphnike tears up a piece of the bandit's cloth to make a bandage for her wounded arm.The wound goes down her shoulder and is very long.After taking care of her wound, Daphnike rides her horse to Sarmatia, to visit her athelfi before returning to her homeland, Themiscrya.*<br>
