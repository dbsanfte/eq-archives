It was a longer walk than he'd remembered it being.  He noticed that more than a few heads turned as he was led down the pathway towards the queen's hut.  He heard whispers, questioning if the queen had decided to mate and that the boy was the chosen one to give her a child.  He smirked slightly, blushing at the mere suggestion that he'd father children.  He was a boy in many respects and that was most definitely the most obviously painful one.  He took a deep breath, hoping that Solari and Delerium did not notice his discomfort at the idea of having intimate relations with a woman.  He swallowed hard as his eyes caught the eyes of a young amazon as they walked past.  He smiled at her, and turned slightly to watch as he walked by.

Even as a child he'd learned to never speak over someone especially when that someone was a queen such as Delerium.  His memory from his childhood in Themiscrya was full of good memories, but then they were also full of the knowledge that here in this place he would always be a second class citizen, even if he were the son of a queen.  His brow furrowed lightly at the thought, but he recovered quickly.  With the four of them standing within sight of the queen's hut, a small crowd had begun to gather, curious as to what the boy was doing with the two queens on the path to Hippolyte's hut.

Hippolyte stood up from the couch and walked over to the group.  Her brown eyes adjusting once again to the light in the room.  Then she saw the two Queens, princes...and a young man.

Nonetheless, he was not eagerly looking forward to a bath in the river.  It was not that his body was in anyway anything for him to be ashamed of, by any means.  He was becoming a man and his body had changed dramatically in the recent months.  His discomfort came from knowing that though a guard would be sent to watch over him, there would more than likely be more than one set of prying eyes on him as he disrobed.  <br>
<br>
He grinned, straightening his back, deciding in that split moment that it may not be such a bad thing to be naked in front of girls who rarely if ever saw a man without his leathers on.  He glanced at Alkaria who clung to her mother, then to Delerium.  He thought he caught a tone of amusement in his mother's voice but he wasn't certain.  He nodded to his mother and moved so that the queens could lead him out of the hut and down to the river.  &quot;I will see you then at the feast, Mother?&quot;  He cast her a small smile as he was lead out.  It felt good to be home and it was only bound to get better. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td
