I believe the Scrolls helped to put everything into perspective and maybe give you each something to work with.  So in the spirit of giving you something to do I will again begin to put out the Scrolls from the Oracle.  Please bear with me as this will be time consuming and I want to become more available to those who would like input or to simply rp out a scenario.  Hopefully, this tool will be helpful to you.<br>

Burgess, PhD.<br>
<br>
IN THE BEGINNING<br>
<br>
The Babylonioans may have called their creation story by a different name.  We call it Enuma Elish, which means &quot;when above,&quot; because these are the openings words of the Babylonian Genesis story.<br>
<br>
One of the most important stories in Mesopotamian mythology was the Enuma Elish (also called the Babylonian Genesis), which detailed the Babylonian account of the creation of the universe.  The mythic account spread northwest through Assyria (although the Assyrians substituted the name of their high god, Ashur, for the Babylonian god Marduk).<br>
<br>
During the 1840s, an excavation of the library of King Ashurbanipal, who ruled Assyria in the 7th Century BCE, led to the dicovery of seven clay tables on which the Enuma Elish was inscribed.  The tablets date back to about 1,000 BCE, but teh story may date back another thousand years or more.<br>
<br>
MEET THE NEW BOSS<br>
<br>
The story of the Enuma Elish goes something like this...<br>
<br>
In the beginning, all that existed were the male Apsu (the ancient sweet-water - That is, unsalted-ocean), the female Tiamat (the salt water ocean), and their son Mummu (probably a rising mist).  Yet even they were indistinct, minlged into an undefined mass.<br>
<br>
Apsu and Tiamat conceived two pairs of divine children.  Little is known of the older pair.  But the younger pair, Anshar and Kishar, had a son they named Anu.  Now this son Anu - the god of the sky - begot Ea (also called Nudimmud or Enki) and many other children.  An exceptionally wise and strong god - the god of underground sweet waters as well as the god of powerful magic - Ea would become the master of all gods, even his fathers.<br>
<br>
QUIET UP THERE!<br>
<br>
The older generations of gods - who wanted nothing more than undistubed peace and quiet - thought the younger gods made too much noise with their constant revelry.  The elders asked the children to quiet down, but the young gods could not curb their exuberance.<br>
<br>
Finally, Apsu could take no more.  Supported by his primeval son Mummu, Apsu resoved to end their clamor once and for all by destroying his offspring, despite Tiamat's protests.<br>
<br>
Hearing of Apsu's rage, the other gods fretted about their impending destruction.  But wise Ea protected them by casting a magic spell on his great-grandfather, the father of the gods.<br>
<br>
Bewitched, Apsu finally gained the sleep he wanted.  But as he slept, Ea stripped Apsu of his splendor and his might.  Ea took the crown off Apsu's head and put it on his own.  Though Ea spared Tiamat, who had opposed her husband's plot, he killed Apsu and imprisoned Mummu.  Ea now held all power of the gods.<br>
<br>
CLASH OF THE TITANS<br>
<br>
Ea lived gloriously with his wife, Damkina. They had a wondrous child, Marduk.  By sucking on the breasts of goddesses, Marduk acquired even more divine power and divine characteristics.  From the very beginning, Marduk inspired awe-even before his proud and overjoyed papa, Ea, doubled his child's dimensions and gave him two faces.<br>
<br>
Yet Tiamat was disturbed by her husband's violent death at the hands of Ea.  Egged on by a faction of the other gods, Tiamat decided to avenge her husband's death by declaring war on the gods who had taken part or sided with those who took part in Apsu's murder.  Gearing up for the battle, Tiamat gave birth to 11 kinds of bloodthirsty monsters, serpents and dragons and rallied the rebel gods to her side.<br>
<br>
Tiamat chose the rebel leader, Kingu (whose whispers had helped create this strife), as her mate.  Giving him the &quot;tablet of destinies,&quot; which had formidable magic power and gave its owner control over the divination of the the future, she granted Kingu dominion over all other gods.  Kingu fastened the tablet to his chest as a sign of his new power.<br>
<br>
Ea, forewarned, launched a counterattack that failed.  His grandfather Anshar asked his son Anu (Ea's father) to intevene and calm Tiamat.  But Anu returned quaking with fear, for he knew that Tiamat could neither be persuaded by diplomacy nor tamed by magic.  Physical violence alone was all that might defeat her - and Anu feared that no one could survive in battle with the mighty Tiamat.<br>
<br>
The prospects looked very grim for the young gods, but Anshar suddenly remembered the strength, wisdom and supreme divinity of his great grandson:  Ea's son Marduk.<br>
<br>
Petitioned by Anshar, the powerful, confident Marduk quickly rallied the gods behind him.  He promised to deliver them from the powerful threat of Tiamat but only if they granted him supreme and undisputed authority over the gods.<br>
<br>
The gods assembled for a feast, built Marduk a throne, gave him supreme power over the pantheon and the universe and urged him to go cut the life out of Tiamat.<br>
<br>
Marduk armed himself with a bow, a quiver of arrows, and a club.  The god of storms, Marduk caused lightning to go before him.  He fashioned a net, which the four winds, a gift from his grandather Anu, carried for him.  In addition, he created the hurricane, the cyclone, the whirlwind, and four more winds of his own.  Causing a floding rain to precede him, Marduk drove his fearsome storm chariot to his showdown with Tiamat.<br>
<br>
Kingu and all of Tiamat's followers trembled at the sight of mighty Marduk.  But Tiamat herself taunted Marduk and let loose a terrifying roar.  Unfazed, Marduk condemned Tiamat's wickedness and challenged her to a duel.  Though shaken by his fearlessness, Tiamat accepted the challenge of single combat.<br>
<br>
Marduk quickly enmeshed her in his net.  When Tiamat opened her mouth to devour him, Marduk sent the evil wind into her mouth to prevent her from closing it.  As the raging winds inside her swelled her body, Marduk sent a shaft flying down her throat.  The arrow pierced her heart and killed her.<br>
<br>
The rebel gods, terrified, tried to escape.  But Marduk quickly rounded them up, stripped them of their weapons and improsoned them.  Marduk tore the powerful table of destinies from Kingu's breast and fastened it to his own.<br>
<br>
RECIPE FOR CREATION: TAKE ONE DIVINE BODY, BREAK IT IN TWO...<br>
<br>
Marduk split the skull of Tiamat's corpse with his club, opened her arteries, and bid the north wind to carry her flood far and wide.  He then split her body in two, forming the sky from one half o fher coprse and the earth from the other.  Next Marduk created the rest of the universe.  He set up stations for the great gods in the sky, assigning 300 gods to heaven and 300 to earth and delegating unique responsibilities to each.  He placed constellations to help organize the calendar.  He erected teh east and west gates through which the sun could enter and depart the world each day.  And he created the moon to watch over the night.<br>
<br>
The victorious gods, led by Marduk, enslaved the gods who had rebelled, forcing them to feed their conquerors.  When the enslaved gods petitoned Marduk for mercy, the lord of all gods resolved to set the captive gods free.  But for Kingu, who had incited Tiamat to revolt and created strife among the gods, Marduk reserved a special punishment.  Marduk's father Ea killed Kingu, cutting his arteries and creating humankind from his blood.  This new race then assumed the responsibility that the freed gods no longer performed:  feeding the Babylonian divinities (through sacrificial offerings).<br>
<br>
HEY, THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR!<br>
<br>
Whether or not the Greeks actually borrowed any elements of the Babylonian Creation myth in devising their own, certain parallels do exist:<br>
<br>
~~&gt;  The waters Apsu and Tiamat came first, just as in<br>
         Hesiod's version, without any explanation.<br>
<br>
~~&gt;  Within this primeval mass were contained all the <br>
        elements later known, but all without form, a <br>
        description that Ovid would echo in Metamorphoses.<br>
<br>
~~&gt;  An older generation of gods plotted the destruction of <br>
        the younger generation.  But the younger generation <br>
        ultimately defeated and overthrew the elders who <br>
        wanted to destroy them.<br>
<br>
~~&gt;  Just as the Greek story of the strife between immortals <br>
        represented the victory of a male-dominated over a <br>
        female-dominated tradition, so did the story of Marduk's <br>
        rise to power over all the gods and all creation.<br>
<br>
~~&gt;  Like the Greek Earth Mother Gaia, the Babylonian Tiamat was the first goddess.  A mother Goddess, she, like Gaia, first gave birth to the greatest of gods and later incited a revolt by giving birth to the world's monsters and demons.<br>
<br>
~~&gt;  Both Marduk and Zeus were armed with lightning.  The Baylonians, like the later Greeks and Romans, raised a storm god above all others in the pantheon.<br>
<br>
~~&gt;  The gods of the pantheon (whether Babylonian, Greek or Roman) were arbitrary, willful and unpredictable, not unlike the world in which these ancient peoples lived.<br>

Burgess, PhD.    I thought this information might be more interesting information.  Just a quick reminder there were four Ages of Man that we have already discussed:  The Golden (During the age of Cronus, the titan), The Silver (During the reign of Zeus), The Bronze (mightly and violent race created by Zeus) and the fourth The Iron (See description below).  <br>
<br>
HARD AS NAILS: THE IRON MAN<br>
<br>
Finally the last race of mortals came: our own human race.  Here Ovid and Hesiod agree.  This was by far the basest race of all.  Ours was the race that first gave evil free rein over the Earth. Modesty gave way to shamelessness; truth to deceit; and righteousness to vice and violence.  This race of men, later abetted by the creation fo women, would scheme and cheat and even kill to fulfill their greed.<br>
<br>
The life of men born in the Iron Age is one of constant work.  Neither day nor night offers any rest from man's pain and labor.  No longer content with the fruit of natural harvests men began mining for gold and precious metals and of course for iron.  Iron men invented the concept of private proeprty, plotting out their acreage and marking off boundaries on the land, once as free as air or water or sunlight.<br>
<br>
The iron men took up arms and went to war against one another.  Gold became its object; iron it's weapon.  Civility and the bonds of society dissolved.  Hosts attacked their guests; guests plundered their hosts. Brothers killed brothers and sons pushed their fathers toward death.<br>
<br>
This sinful race, the classical poets agree, is the one into which all of us are born.  And this race has banished justice, loyalty and piety from the world.<br>
