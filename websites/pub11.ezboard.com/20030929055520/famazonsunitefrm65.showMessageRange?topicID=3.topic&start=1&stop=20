He wanted to stay near to his mother and her tribe.  <br>
<br>
His eyes scanned the gates as he entered.  This was a peaceful city this day and he breathed a sigh of relief.  Surely he could find work in this place.<br>
<br>
He approached an elderly gentleman who looked to be having trouble with his pack.  Carefully, Theseus moved to take the burden from the old man.  &quot;Let me help you with that sir.&quot;  He was careful not to appear too threatening or confrontational.  The old man nodded slowly and grinned, his eyes almost dancing at the youth that had offered his strength to assist him.  The man, bent and aged, almost straightened now that the burden had been lifted.  <br>
<br>
&quot;You've come here in search of a job, yes?&quot;  The old man began as Theseus walked along side him carrying his load.  &quot;Yes, sir, I am quite good with my hands.  I've worked as a farmer, carpenter, and other labor for some time now.&quot;  The old man studied him, &quot;You have the gait of a warrior, young man.&quot;  It was true, Theseus had apparently inherited more of Hippolyte's characteristics than Gabrielle's.  His shoulders were broad and straight.  His hands were large and strong.<br>
<br>
The old man continued, &quot;My son is a general in the army.  I can see to it that you receive a post.  Troy is a peaceful city so the post would be a relatively safe one unless the fates decide against it.&quot;  Theseus nodded, &quot;I would appreciate any help you could be in securing me a post in Troy's army.  It would be an honor.&quot;  He could not believe his good fortune. <br>
<br>
He carried the man's pack for him then parted company with the assurance of meeting the following day to secure a place in Troy's military.  He then went in search of the tavern, for drink, food, and a place to spend the night. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alexiares>Alexiares</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#993300>(4/28/03 8:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm65.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/queenhippolyte/images/alexiares.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Place to Live</span><hr size=1> As the young man passed her, Alexiares eyes became locked on.

It was important to know i he was not only going to live here but be a member of their army.  He smiled thinking how proud Hippolyte would be of him if he were a warrior.  He could scarcely wait to tell her of his good fortune.  After a time of exploring the city, unknown to him that he was being followed.  Theseus entered the local tavern in Troy and secured himself a room.  He was not much on sitting in a tavern and being still for very long.  He wanted to be outside, under the blue sky.  He bought a loaf of bread, some mead, and some meat.   He settled outside to eat and drink in the relative quiet of the open air.  His eyes watched a few people as he reclined on the ground against a tree. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daughterofshylock>Daughter of Shylock</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.picturesof.net/_wallpaper/rose_Dsc08151_WP.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 318<br> <font color=#993300>(4/29/03 12:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm65.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Wolf in the city</span><hr size=1> The young man, Wulf Loire walked through the streets of Troy with an arrogance that was seen by all. However, most Romans held theirselves in such form, Wulf's came from pride of his people, and not of himself. <br>
He wore a white tanktop and his leather pants. On his right shoulder, he bore the mark of the pack. Which was known widely throughout Greece as a Scynthian Warrior. On his other arm he bore a tiger and a wolf, with the names &quot;Xanthe&quot; and &quot;Jadeyn&quot; written below each animal. On his wrist in red ink, was the word &quot;Justice&quot; written out.<br>
<br>
In his arms he carried a large crate and glanced around as to where he would be taking it. Since Wulf left Scynthia by Amazon law, he lived in Athens and worked as a metal worker in designing new weapons and such. He was there to make a delivery to the army of Troy.<br>

<br>
She was about to go up and speak to the young man, but then was stopped when she saw the Scynthian warrior walking by with a crate of weapons.

He would have gotten up to help but the man seemed to have everything under control and there was a certain manner about him that seemed to give off the illusion that he needed no help from anyone.  <br>
<br>
As Theseus began to drink his mead, his eyes drifted off to the left and rested on a young girl hugged up close to a tree.  He smiled watching her as she watched the weapons dealer make his way through the city streets.

She was dressed in a sheer blue fabric that flowed around her tanned form like a soft breeze.  Her feet were bare, as Alexiares perferred.  She liked how the dirt and grass felt on her skin.  <br>

He looked to Theseus as he asked the question about which Gods. Wulf was highly invollved in such conversations, the topic of what Gods served would be an interesting one to begin with. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">~*~ Jessica ~*~<br>
