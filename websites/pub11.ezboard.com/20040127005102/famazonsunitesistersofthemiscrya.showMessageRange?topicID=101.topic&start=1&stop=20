She felt horrible as if she could not continue this, she wanted to run, she wanted to hide from this horrible reality yet the more she this fearful pain dawned on her it would slowly transform from pain to hate. She felt it deeper then she had ever, deeper then she felt it for her father, deeper then she felt it for those monks that had robbed her of her life. This deep erie hatred that she did not know existed within her grew, and as it grew stronger it would change once more into that of what she was but did not know it and the strong, powerful sense of vengeance began to pump through her veins fueling her heart with its awful black fury. Rage burned within her a defining spark at first that caught onto that hatred growing burning into a blaze and those eye's would widen and she would rise to her feet free of her friends grasps, now within a trance the only thought trapped within her mind was to kill. With all this racing through her head fueling her but not about to be let loose she would look to Callisto and with the look she possessed within those eye's her affection, her gratitude, the bond she offered and the comfort she felt could all be scene directed toward Callisto. Then the the fire within her would reach its horrid peak, Vengeance must be taken, they must pay for what they had done.

She had a strange look on her face, one of a need to return, something not finished yet. Her body had realized that it was not her time yet. No matter how bad life had been, death would be worse for her.

&quot;I'm not loosing another person I love - even if I have to personally go down to the underworld and get her back.&quot;<br>

She sighed and began to clean the blood from Alysia's body. Unsuccessfully, of course, considering she was still covered in the blood of the centaurs who had stood in her path as she went to Aly.<br>
<br>
She pulled up a chair and sat beside Aly's lifeless body, silently praying that she'd return.. She had to.<br>
