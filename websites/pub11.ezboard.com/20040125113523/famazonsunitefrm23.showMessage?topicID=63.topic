His dear mother, a woman of intense love and security.  Maia reminded him of cotton candy.  Warm and sugary, and very very soft.  When his mother is around, Hermes just wanted to be enfolded in her arms, and fall into an endless sleep, filled with dreams of pink fluffy clouds.  Adrift in her love, Hermes knew that his mother contained the passion and ferocity of a raging lioness.  He knew for sure that no matter what he may do, no one was going to ever hurt him, not as long as she is around.  Staring into her starry eyes, he saw within, a dedication to motherhood so strong that it made his heart ache.  He knew that he only wanted to make her happy and proud.  Hermes wanted to kiss his mother, but knew that a sign of affection at this moment would not be appropriate.  So he settled for holding her hand instead.<br>
<br>
Hestia, his aunt, appeared to be a lady, that deserved utmost respect.  But Hermes mental powers were already fully developed, as is those of every god and goddess upon their birth.  Hermes realized that underneath his aunt's demeanor, is a goddess filled with warm and dedicated love of life.  She was like a rich Gaul eclair.  Crispy and fresh on the outside, but oozing with delicious laughter and love on the inside.  Hermes mentally noted that, if he ever got in trouble, especially with his mother, he knew his Aunt Hestia would be there for him.<br>
<br>
Then there is Ares, his half-brother.  It seems ranking and status is very important here on Olympus, and it seems Ares felt it was very important as well.  Even from a distance, Hermes could feel the aura of power and dedication his brother contained.  But of what is he so dedicated to?  In his mind, Hermes thought of Ares as strong, Greek wine.  Made with the spicyest grapes from the famous vineyards of Athens, and aged with hidden and secret spices.  Only the most brave dared to try, and only with the most cautionary of sips.  That was what Hermes thought his brother was like.  And true to Hermes nature for mischief, he wanted to try the wine over and over.  Maybe he'll be intoxicated, maybe he'll get burnt, but he knew that he was going to have a lot fin, and get into a lot of trouble with Ares.  And so Hermes smiled, a small sly twitch of his lips, as he watched Ares disappear.  He knew they were going to cross paths many many times.<br>
<br>
Even before his Aunt Aphrodite appeared, a fanfare of trumpets and the singing of lovebirds heralded her aunt's appearance.  It seemed as if she was floating, but all immortals could do that.  It seemed as if she was floating, not because of her own doing, but because of the bountiless praises and devotions offered to her from her countless worshippers.  She is Love incarnate.  Hermes liked her right from the start.  It wasn't because he was a male, it was because that was what she demanded.  It was impossible not to love Love.  She had a sinful taste to her.  Like the decadent chocolate made from cocoa beans in a land far far to the west.  Where only the royalty of that far away kingdom were allowed to sample that nectar.  Seeing her approach, and watching the reaction of the other males in the room, Hermes began scheming.  How could he get his aunt into trouble, without being caught.  It seemed as if she wanted to be naughty.  All her worshippers, their basest desire was to have Aphrodite ooze and seep into every pore of their body.  What a naughty idea!  Hermes would have blushed except he was too young to realize the conotations.  But then again, maybe not.<br>
<br>
And in came a being of extraordinary radiance.  Hermes had seen statues all over the Mediterranean, and none of them did justice to this being.  If perfection was real, then this must be him.  As Hermes looked, it seemed as if tiny bits of light were surrounding his brother.  Looking closer, he realized that they were tiny stars, orbiting around Apollo.  For even they knew that Apollo is the Lord of Light, Keeper of the Sun.  As Apollo approached, and offered a gift to Hermes.  Hermes liked his brother immediately.  His brother tasted like an ice cream cone eaten on a hot and bristling afternoon.  His brother's glory may be intense, but his love is like a cool salve that tempers the intense heat.  HoldingApollo's gift, Hermes realized that he wanted to offer something in return.  But he wanted to do it in a very special and symbolic way, Hermes style.  Then he remembered that there was a herd of Apollo's cattle not too far from where he and his mother lived.  A plan that involved cattle, stealing, and a lyre quickly hatched into his mind.  Grinning mischieviously at his brother, Hermes said his thanks.<br>
<br>
The sudden chill that filled the room only meant one thing.  His uncle Hades had arrived.  With utmost respect, Hermes turned around to meet his uncle.  Dressed in rich velvet embroidered with the many tales of Hades conquest, Hades was an entity not to be trifled with.  It seemed as if an invisible breeze meant only for Hades was blowing through his cape.  Then Hermes realized that it was the breathes of many souls, souls still left uncollected on the mortal realm.  Hermes understood the significance of this encounter.  He knew that not only was he to be the messenger of the Gods, but he would become the Bearer of Souls.  He knew that he would be intricately incolved with his uncle, as he guided recently departed souls into his uncle's nether realms.  His uncle tasted like ancient ginseng, recently unearthed and very potent.  A root of immense power and mystical abilities, hidden from the outside world, and only barely understood.  That was what Hades tasted like to Hermes.  Such ancient secrets were hidden within Hades, this Hermes was sure of.  After all, souls of countless eons resides in Hades realm.  And what secrets they held in mortal life, Hades now held in immortal afterlife.  Bowing with respect like he had been taught by his mother, Hermes replied in a strong but reverent voice, &quot;Hermes, sir.&quot;<br>

Who should appear, but Hades young and vibrant wife, Persephone.<br>
<br>
Hermes wondered what kind of trouble will occur now that both husband and wife are together.  After all, Hades had managed to keep Persephone all to himself for half a year, and the fact that Persephone is here indicated that her time underground was over.  So spring must be here too.<br>
<br>
Casting a quick glance at Hades, he saw true love in those ebony eyes.  But Hades is a gentleman, true to his soul, and he wouldn't force Persephone back, unless it was by her own free will.<br>
<br>
Smiling at his young cousin, brimming with youthful energy.  Hermes happily accepted the treat his cousin had brought him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you&quot; Hermes said around a mouthful of cotton candy.<br>
<br>
As he licked his fingers, cleaning the lingering pieces of spun sugar off, he listened intently to the conversation Persephone was having with his mother.  <br>
<br>
He thought Persephone was a lot like the crystal fresh spring water found only in the hidden springs of the Himalayas.  The yogis of those hidden temple selfishly kept the treasure to themselves, for they knew how potent the liquid in clearing up the mind.  In fact, many of them often began their meditations with a drink of the water, as a rite of purification of the mind.  <br>
<br>
As Hermes listened, he became more and more more worried about meeting Hera and Zeus.  Were they really as bad as everyone made them out to be?  He knew that he had to make his own decisions, and he knew that his first encounter with them will surely set the stage of their relationships.<br>
<br>
Hermes held his mother's hand even tighter.<br>

Even though she was not a strong Olympian, she would fight for her son with all her heart and soul.  She listened carefully as each God appeared and approached her son.  Wary of who could be only here to check things out for Hera.  Her slender form seemed weak and powerless next to them all.  But, even Hera would not be a threat to Hermes rightful place upon Mount Olympus.  This daughter of Atlas would not allow it.  But, she decided to take the advice and would send a present to Hera.  Her eyes narrowed a bit thinking of the Queen of the Gods. Then they calmed as she looked down at Hermes.<br>
&quot;My son,&quot; she spoke softly. &quot;I know your father will be proud to see you.  You have nothing to worry about. And your see, you already have family here to help you.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/utheerinyes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Erinyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(6/29/01 5:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=63.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> In a blaze of fire. . .</span><hr size=1> In a blaze of red fire, Alecto appeared before all the Gods. She stood there and looked at Maia grinning. &quot;Well well well little niece. Looks like you did Daddy proud.&quot; She walked around Maia a little bit. &quot;The Titans, my dear brothers and sisters were placed in bondage forever, and you are capable of placing a child of yours on Olympus.&quot; She stood before Maia glancing down at Hermes every now and then. &quot;Congrats. Not many have been able to do so. However, I'd watch out Maia, Hera has been looking for you.&quot; Alecto then turned from Maia patting Hermes gently on the head then walking past Ares and Apollo leaning herself up against a wall.<br>
<br>
In a blaze of blue fire, Megaera appeared before all the Gods. She looked at Maia, she came to bring the same news as her sister had moments before, but seeing Aphrodite instead she walked over to the Love Goddess smirking. &quot;Hey Hey girl.&quot;<br>
<br>
In a blaze of black fire, Tisiphone appeared before all the Gods. She didn't take a moments look at Maia, just went over to Hermes with a smile on her face. She patted him on the head gently and reached behind her back pulling out a small wooden horse. She pulled the tail of it and it rolled along the floor like a wind-up-toy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">
