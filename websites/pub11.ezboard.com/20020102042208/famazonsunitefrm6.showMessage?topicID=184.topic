 Jade was born in a forest near a temple of the goddess of victory,Nike. Nike being her mother, her mother had thought it only suitable if she had her near a shrine of herself. So she was born by the shrine, she never saw her father as she grew up. She came slowly to despise they slightly as she learned her father was not there and not ever going to be. She was 16 years old and her mother had trained her some fighting skills and she was practicing in the forest one day when she came upon a warrior passing through. She came outside to practice a virgin, and went back in the shrine no longer innocent. She never saw the man again and realized she was pregnant a few months later. Her mother was furious but sympathetic and Jade had to do all she could to keep her mother from tracking down the man and killing him. But she was happy, pregnant..but happy. She had a beautiful baby girl with pretty brown hair and blue eyes..she was named Azailia.  She was a strong,beautiful girl..she died at age 5 when she was outside playing and drowned in a nearby lake. Jade had just gone in for a second to get something and came back to find her child dead in the water, she blamed herself. Her kind, sweet nature turned to a bitterness and coldheartedness. She was disappointed in herself above all, so she made herself in the most horrible person she could think of. She is a great fighter because of her passion and protectiveness, her only downfall is she blames herself for the death of her daughter and her bitterness sometimes causes her to be quite coldhearted. Her dream is to one day be a mother again to a child and raise it to never be like her, to be kind and sweet and innocent. But she knows very well that that dream will probably never come true.<br>

During his preteen years, his parents parents were sent for to diplomatic purposes to India and then to the land of Chin for 4 years. There Fogstone was taught the arts of there fighting, meditation, and other such things from the region. After the four years his parents and himself came back from the successful diplomatic mission, from there they lived in Rome as a great aristocratic family (as they were distant relatives from the Ceasar.) As Fogstone spent the rest of his teenage years in Rome training as a warrior, and as a man of knowledge. Soon after he was taken into the military, he advanced quickly in the steps of power and leadership. After awhile he was given the command of general of the northern army for a short time, and sent to the land of Britannia. And there he became a governer for a small time, and was very good to the people and the land, and after a while he took over Britannia bring his newly married wife next to him on his throne.The people of Britannia accepted Fogstone into there civilization, and even though he kept in contact with room he had Britannia protected by his own army, and in his eyes made Britannia free from Roman rule. Fogstone still visits the land of Chin and India every now and then to remember childhood memories...(( The reason I picked the character &quot;Fogstone&quot; was because is my ancestor, My last name &quot;Foxton&quot; was translated over time from Roman to English from &quot;Fogstone&quot;. My Grandfather Foxton when down in Arazonia met another Foxton, who told him the story about the Roman Commander/General Fogstone and about how he went to Britannia and ruled there. She went to England herself and did research herself, Fogstone may have lived near the end of the Roman era. In england there is even a Foxton canal, and a few other land marks. But if Fogstone had ever gone to Chin of India, I shall not know, I just sort of stuk that in there for the story for the character role playing :).))     <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessage?topicID=180.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessage?topicID=183.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=184.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.threadControl?topicID=184.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=184.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=184.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm37">The Mythical Odyssey Forum<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitefrm32">The Mythical Odyssey<option value="amazonsunitefrm35">Amazon Nation Alliance<option value="amazonsunitefrm33">Character Descriptions<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm30">Amazons of the Sacred Circle<option value="amazonsunitefrm34">Amazons of Lesvos Island<option value="amazonsunitefrm38">High Mountain Tiger Clan<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm28">Amazon Sisters of Cremni<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm31">Amazon Language<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6>Amazons of the Northern Lands</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
