<br>
&quot;So,exactly what do you have planned for dinner?&quot; She questioned,hoping there would be human flesh somewhere in Alysia's answer.<br>
<br>
For awhile Zelia wasn't able to bring herself to kill even to eat,but lately killing didn't seem to be much of a problem. So maybe if a passing merchant or a passing anyone were to cross their path,and with all hopes attack them,Zelia just might beable to eat,and do the honors of carving the feast herself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualysiaofscynthia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alysia of Scynthia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 395<br> <font color=#993300>(8/27/02 2:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=377.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Feasting Upon Flesh</span><hr size=1> Alysia could only imagine what Zelia had in mind, but it was a rumor that when a Scynthian kills, they tend to feast on the flesh of their kill.<br>

She held a cloak in her arms that she picked up along the way through the small village. She placed it around herself and then looked to Zelia.<br>
<br>
&quot;The people here have a thing against warriors. And this time around we don't want to cause a fight.&quot;<br>
<br>
But why? <br>
<br>
She began walking giving a cloak to Zelia as well. She then frowned seeing a small house with tiny children sitting outside holding onto their mother as their father was handing a tall guard a bag full of coins. <br>
<br>
&quot;Taxers.&quot; She sighed and looked to Zelia. &quot;The ruler of this village taxes the people greatly. There's no way to attack him or replace the leader as of right now without starting a war. So I try to keep the peace as much as I can.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled and then snuck her way over to a large boat. <br>
<br>
&quot;Come on.&quot; She looked up at the cargo on board with a grin.<br>
<br>

She took the cloak offered to her,and put it on while Alysia explained the situation of the village.<br>
<br>
&quot;It appears the ruler knows what he wants and how to get it.&quot; She smiles slightly at that. &quot;Too bad you beleive he is untouchable as of right now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Once they reached the large boat,Zelia looked up at the cargo.<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay....&quot; She looks at Alysia now. &quot;What exactly is on that boat that could possibly be dinner? A boat captain? A shipmate? Hmmm?&quot;<br>
<br>
Zelia loved water,but the water around here wasnt shallow,and not knowing how to swim,she normally sank like a stone in water. Before attempting to do anything near the water,she wanted to know what it was. <p>~ If I snap,you'll be the first to go.~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udaughterofshylock.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daughter of Shylock</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 114<br> <font color=#993300>(9/3/02 9:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=377.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Alysia of Scynthia</span><hr size=1> She swiftly crawled on board and motioned Zelia to follow.

As the crew members then began to call for the village guards . . .  the ones that worked for the village &quot;King&quot; as he called himself . .  Aly grinned. The ship crew were innocents, but these were murders and villains. People she'd have no problem harming for fun.<br>

<br>
She wasn't going to have any part of the action without explaination,atleast up until the ships crew began to call for the village gaurds.<br>
<br>
With an exhasperated sigh,she crawled up onto the boat,making sure her feet were steady. She was definitally not one to have sea legs.<br>
<br>
Moving over to Alysia carefully,she looks down at the unconscious boat captain,then looked to Alysia,then to the scurrying crew of the ship. She could smell the blood of innocents faintly;to her sences,everyone around was not fully innocent. She shruggs,then looks back to the unconscious boat captain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Since this one is already out,he'll do nicely.&quot; She explained to Alysia,then reached down and took the boat captain by the collar of his tunic and pulled his limp body up to her level. She inhaled deeply of the captains odor,her nose wrinkling slightly. &quot;Not the freshest pick of the bunch,but....&quot; She smirked,then looked at Alysia. &quot;Is this going to be take out?&quot;<br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;No . . . we're not eating him.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then looked back at the guards approaching her and she opened her hands mumbling ancient words that only a few others knew of. Instantly a golden light emerged from her palms and the guards flew on their backs asleep.<br>
<br>
She then kicked open one of the cargo boxes revealing flour, and rice, and veggies of all kinds. She smiled looking to the starving families in the village and motioned for them to gather as much as they could carry. She then looked to Zelia.<br>

<br>
&quot;You know,I just keep letting people jerk me around.&quot; She mumbled,then sliced open the remaining cargo boxes with her impalers,and even helped load up some of the starving peoples arms with the food. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes take and eat up,get fat and plump...&quot; She smiled sadisticly. &quot;Just the way I like 'em.&quot;<br>
<br>
She then looked at Alysia. &quot;All this helping worked up an even larger appitite.&quot; She cocked her head slightly to the side,then turned and walked over to one of the sleeping gaurds,by passing the villagers.<br>
<br>
Kneeling down some,she quickly slices off a 3-4 inch piece of flesh from one of the gaurds arms,which she happily takes in her hand,then stands back up.<br>

<br>
She had spoken to Gabrielle a while ago about this place. <br>
<br>
She whispered softly.<br>
<br>
&quot;A carnivoras people. They attack the innocent and feed upon them. Feed as you have need to Zelia, for we have more things to attend to.&quot;<br>
<br>
To a Scynthian, feeding upon their victims was ceremonial. It was only done for honor. Alysia never once craved the flesh of another. Perhaps the blood . . .  but never the flesh. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uiizeliaii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>II Zelia II</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 195<br> <font color=#993300>(9/9/02 4:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=377.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> About time</span><hr size=1> As they approached the village,and Alysia spoke,Zelia looked at her.<br>
<br>
At this time,Zelia was feeling a little sea sick from the short water ride. <br>
<br>
A light burp escaped her throat,more or less it was to help settle her upset stomach. She quirked a brow. &quot;Excuse me.&quot; She smiled quickly,then looked upon the village.  A more dangerous look then crossed her features. &quot;Ah yes,I'll be sure to make that boat ride worth the trip.&quot; She said,and quickly exited the boat,and got onto solid ground.<br>
<br>
She looks back to Alysia. &quot;A lioness is not condemed for her need to feed on the helpless wildabeast. It's their nature.&quot; There was some philosophy behind her words. Zelia did not want to be looked down upon for what came natural to her,nor did she think carnivors or cannibals should be looked down upon either. Like Scynthians feeding upon thier victims,its what they know,beleive and do naturally. In a way,she was defending these people that feed upon the innocent.<br>
<br>
She looked to the village again,then glanced to Alysia. <br>
&quot;Are you going to join me?&quot; Her dangerous look took on a dangerous look with a smirk.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualysiaofscynthia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alysia of Scynthia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen of the Amazon Nation Alliance</span><br>  Posts: 411<br> <font color=#993300>(9/12/02 3:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=377.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: About time</span><hr size=1> Alysia knew what she meant, but she too had seen these people devour close amazon friends for the purpose of feeding. <br>

<br>
&quot;No thank you . . . I can withstand hunger easilly.&quot;<br>
<br>
She had to. She spent many years in Scynthia alone when there was no harvest some years and during her healing trial periods, she hunted rarely.<br>

Time Passes<br>

<br>
After about an hour,Zelia finally returned to the boat she and Alysia arrived on. She immediatly went to the water and knelt down,scooping up water in her hands and washing blood from her face and hands. She then stood up,and looked at her blood soaked clothing,she'd have to throw them away since blood easily stained.<br>
<br>
Shrugging to herself she looked toward Alysia who she expected to be waiting at or near the boat. <p>~ If I snap,you'll be the first to go.~</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualysiaofscynthia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alysia of Scynthia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen of the Amazon Nation Alliance</span><br>  Posts: 413<br> <font color=#993300>(9/15/02 4:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=377.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> She stepped into the boat and they began the ways across the black sea where Alysia would continue with Zelia's &quot;training&quot;. <br>

About an hour of silence passed before Aly looked up and questioned.<br>
<br>
&quot;So . . . tell me about yourself.&quot; Alysia knew a good deal about the Destroyers of Hope. She studied a great deal during her time as a bard years earlier.

She turned her gaze from the water to Alysia.<br>
<br>
&quot;You want to know about me? Besides the fact that i'm on this mission to prove my worth to the amazons?&quot; She grunted,and turned her gaze back to the water. Varia hardly knew anything of Zelia,except what she showed on the outside in daily life.<br>
<br>
She began to speak again,but she kept her gaze on the water. &quot;I'm simply a destroyer,the second destroyer. Trying to be an amazon,trying to belong.&quot; She finished with that little sentence. Then closed her eyes,more or less so she didnt have to see the water moving below her,doesnt want to get sick after all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualysiaofscynthia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alysia of Scynthia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen of the Amazon Nation Alliance</span><br>  Posts: 415<br> <font color=#993300>(9/16/02 1:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=377.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Belonging</span><hr size=1> Alysia listened and nodded lightly. She looked down at a scar across her left hand and closed her fist.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know how that feels.&quot; She released her fist.<br>
<br>
&quot;Years ago I was a destroyer in a sense. Not your kind, but in a mortal way I was. I was a warrior for some people who went against the amazons years ago. I didn't know about them going against my sisters, but in the end I was held to blame as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
She sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;I put myself to blame more than anyone else did on that part. But there were a few . . .  there are a few who still believe I do not belong in the Nation let alone as a Queen of a tribe.&quot;<br>
<br>
She paused for a few moments and then looked up.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you know that your place is among the athelfi, and that you are an amazon in heart. . . .then you can do this Zelia. Anyone can.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uiizeliaii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>II Zelia II</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 216<br> <font color=#993300>(9/16/02 2:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=377.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Belonging</span><hr size=1> Zelia opened her eyes and looked at Alysia when she spoke. Her head tilted slightly in interest.<br>
<br>
&quot;I had no idea.&quot; She admitted. &quot;So I guess even those who appear to be looked upon in glory,can aslo be looked down upon in shame.&quot;<br>
<br>
She went silent for a minute or so before speaking again.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have a confession,&quot; She shifted slightly from where she was standing. &quot;I never believed myself an amazon,I never had any care for them,but my mother,she was an amazon before she was killed...&quot; She sighed. &quot;She was killed by an amazon,one of her 'sisters'.&quot; She shook her head to rid the image that came across her mind. &quot;Anyways,after she was killed,I had a curiosity about the amazons...I wanted to know why my mother became an amazon,and why she was killed by one. Thats why I decided to join the Themiscrya Tribe,I wanted to know the answers to my questions.&quot; She stopped and looked at Alysia to see if she was understanding what she was saying.<br>
<br>
&quot;I never had feelings,good ones anyways about the amazons,I just knew I had to be as loyal as I could be,so I can learn what I needed to know,and then came that day on the battlefield when De'Lerium killed me,then when I was brought back by Dahak,I hated the amazons with a vengience.&quot; She groaned,and racked a hand through her hair,hoping she wasn't admitting too much.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was on my way back to amazon lands to get the revenge I wanted so baddly,thats when I bumped into Varia.&quot;  She went silent,remebering that day,she tried to fight it,but a tear escaped her eyes anyways. She continues. &quot;I attacked Varia,I was going to kill her,I was so close,and then,It was like fate intercepted,well to try and make this not so long,I was the one who got injured,nearly defencless,but Varia showed me mercey and care. Thats when I got a whole new outlook on the amazons.&quot;<br>
<br>
She cleared her throat,then added. &quot;Thats not explaining the next war I was summoned to,where I gained feelings and emotions. They might be artificial,but they feel real to me.&quot; She finally finished. And looking at Alysia,she wriped away the few tears from her cheeks.<br>
