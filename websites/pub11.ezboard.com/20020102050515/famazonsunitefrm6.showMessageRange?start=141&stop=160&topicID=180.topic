<br>
She sighs as she looks into the flames of the small fire.Thinking about the battle to come,and the small battle that had happened earlier with the rogue centaurs.She had luckily gotten out of that situation without harm,but it pained her to think of the amazon that had lost her life.Why is it that there always seems to be centaurs to attack amazons?Kala always felt caught between the two,centaur and amazons.For she had the blood of both running through her vains,but the centaurs that she was apart of were good,and had peace with the amazons.But still,she couldnt help but feel the way she did.She sighs again,and struggles to her feet.She didnt feel to good,go figure.<br>
<br>
"Not again."Her brows furrow as she clasps a hand over her mouth and hurries out of her tent,and runs behind a tree,and becomes sick.<br>
<br>
After losing her breakfast,she wripes her mouth and walks back to her tent to get out of the rain that still poured down.She sits down on her furs,and sighs yet again.She hated being away from Smyrna expecially in her condition,she wanted this battle to come and go already,she knew that the amazons would win,we were far too strong to just lose in a war like this.She wondered if she should go see Alysia about the strategy,but decided if she were to know,then she would be informed like all the rest,And so she lays back against the furs,and waits for further information. <p>|•| Kala of Smyrna |•|</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ulatraariah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LaTra Ariah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#993300>(8/26/01 2:34:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Talking to Aly</span><hr size=1> Ariah sat where she was for a long time.

<br>
Under the blankets,Evelyn moves around making little noises that children do when they wake up,she worms her way out of the blankets and yawns big.She rubs her eyes with her lil hands then looks around.She then stands up,slightly staggering from still being a little asleep.She walks to the tent opening and looks outside,the sun was out,but it was still raining,and she frowns.She then sits down infront of the tent opening and watches the going ons from there.Her tummy growling a little as she sits there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udelilahtragedy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Delilah Tragedy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#993300>(8/26/01 10:46:51 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Waking up</span><hr size=1> Delilah had spent part of the extremely rainy morning under a tree near the outside perimeter of the camp, but in easy view of her hut where Evelyn had apparently woken up. She was sharpening her blades, making sure they were sharp enough to slice through flesh with ease. Her eyes glanced up at the sky as she muttered, &quot;Not letting up any time soon..&quot;<br>
<br>
It looked as if this rain would last long enough to go straight through the war, whenever that was going to happen. She didn't mind in the least bit of course. She would figure that the Northern Amazons would be well adapted to such cold, wet weather, and since it looked as if the Amazons had decided to keep camp here, the war would probably end up taking place in familiar territories to them. This would be good news.  It would probably be difficult for lizards, with that scaly skin of theirs, to climb trees as easily, especially with such wet bark.<br>
<br>
She was concerned about the horses though. The amazons really wouldn't be able to ride them in such muck and mud.  The war may even end up on foot.  She was fine with whatever conditions were available.<br>
<br>
She put away her weaponry back into their covers on her body and stood up, pulling back her wet hair out of her face. &quot;I hope those amazons on guard aren't getting numb...&quot; she mutered again as she headed inside the camp.<br>
<br>
She walked over to the set-up covered spot for the &quot;kitchen&quot; within the camp and picked up some cheese and some warmed bread, wrapped it in a cloth and carried it over to her hut where Evelyn was staying.<br>
<br>
She looked in the tent opening. &quot;Brought you something to eat. Have fun.. &quot; she smiled lightly and then pulled some something out of a pack that her larger tiger had been carrying. It was a well carved flute of wood; she had gotten bored on her ride to Scynthia days back and had made it with the time she spent on her tiger. &quot;You can have it..&quot; She put it down next to the food and then left the tent.<br>
<br>
Delilah glanced around at the busy campsite and then headed for LaTra Alysia's tent and askd for the posted amazon there to ask Alysia if she may speak to her. Delilah stood out side the tent flap and waited. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udelilahtragedy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Delilah Tragedy</A> at: 8/26/01 10:49:58 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uyoungevelyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Young Evelyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#993300>(8/26/01 11:29:42 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/alteredsoulsx/images/evelyn-6.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> :)</span><hr size=1> Evelyn sighs as she watched the going ons while sitting at the opening of the tent she was in.However she perks up when Delilah comes to her and gives her some food.She smiled,but her smiled brightens when Delilah gives her the flute.&quot;Oooooh Thank yous!&quot;She happily picks up the flute and blows in it once,then looks back up to see Delilah had already gone on her way after bringing her the stuff.The smile turns upside down into a frown.<br>
<br>
She stands up grabbing a chunk of cheese and bread and eating it down quickly.Coughing some as she almost chokes,but luckily she gets the food down.She then pulls out that flute and prances around in the tent blowing into the flute,to her making good music,but to anyone else,it was horrible and irritating,but she keeps on playing it.Just thinking happy thoughts now,with a new toy and all how could she not be happy at the moment?As she plays the flute she dances her way out of the tent,not much paying attention to the rain.Happy happy,she plays that flute and skips around the camp area,splashing mud about,and getting herself dirty in the process. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uyoungevelyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Young Evelyn</A> at: 8/26/01 11:30:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udelilahtragedy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Delilah Tragedy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#993300>(8/27/01 12:27:58 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Death of a Tiger</span><hr size=1> Delilah, who was waiting for Alysia's approval suddenly felt  sharp pain in her back and neck and hit her knees. She groaned as she reached behind her and rubbed her back and neck. &quot;Curses...&quot;<br>
<br>
Her eyes suddenly froze over into a pale gray as the image of the Orio-Pata tiger came to her mind. She saw Eris in her equally childish retalliation to what Dawn's tiger had done.. Out of it's OWN accord.. She saw the tree that collapsed on the tiger. It hurt her back and neck even more, though a goddess, since she had a link to all tigers, demonic or not. She groaned and pulled herself to her feet as she also heard Eris's fretting words to Hippolyte all the way in Themiscrya beat within her head.  She groaned a third time and pushed her way through the tent without waiting and walked into Alysia's hut without announcement.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dawn.. I must speak to you a moment.&quot; She grabbed Dawn's arm roughly and pulled her to a corner of the hut and spoke quietly as she rubbed her back.<br>
<br>
&quot;One of your tigers.. it went to the temple of Eris and destroyed it. Eris found it in it's state and in retalliation, probably thinking you had the tiger do it, made a tree fall on it... [reason why I'm hurting here]... She also...,&quot; she winced, &quot;Also went to Hippolyte and demaned revenge... saying something about not taking your attitude or something... she said she wants revenge or make sure every amazon suffers. I could probably take her on, but I don't need to get involved with my unpleasant Olympian family. I suggest you take care of this quickly and without attitude and violence. The Amazons don't need another period of Strife on their backs. Got it?&quot; She was very grumpy and very sad from losing concentration and from the thought of the poor tiger that had made up it's own mind to defend the honour and respect of Dawn.<br>
<br>
She then let Dawn do whatever she would and waited quietly where she stood for Alysia to be ready to speak to her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ukalankash.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kalan Kash</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#993300>(8/27/01 1:03:05 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/kalankash/images/kalan-1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:</span><hr size=1> ::Kalan snorts and opens his eyes,not only seeing but hearing a child amazon dancing around playing a flute.His ears twitch as the noise irritates his sences,but he can't help but smile at the young ones youth and happiness even in a situation such as what was going to happen eventually.He also wondered why she was there,he shruggs to himself as he then raises up,standing.He then looks up at the sky and the rain still pouring down.::I hope these amazons can fight well in rain.::He spoke to himself.Then looked around at the movement in the area.He watched as a distraught looking Delilah went into a tent.::Hmmm...::He sighs,thinking he isnt much help,maybe some food will do some good.He turns and walks into the forest quietly until he spots a rabbit near a bush.It wouldnt be much for him,but in this wheather,it'll proboly be the only thing he could find at the moment.He crouches down,placing his front claws onto the ground,slowly he stalks toward the rabbit,the rabbit completly oblivious to his pressence.Without further ado,he leaps and pounces after the rabbit,and with one quick swipe of his front right paw,he snatches the rabbit from the ground and into his strong grasp,and quickly he grabs the rabbits head with his left claw and rips the head off.He then walks back to the amazon camp,doing so he cleans the untastefull skin from the rabbits corpse then in a few bites,the rabbit was gone,bone and all.::Appitizing.::He mumbles to himself as he reaches the amazon camp.Licking off any blood that was left from his small meal,from his muzzle.He leans against the tree he had taken a nap by ealier and watches the camp:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ulatraariah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LaTra Ariah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#993300>(8/27/01 1:19:41 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Over to see Evelyn</span><hr size=1> After speaking to Alysia on taking Evelyn back, she went outside and smiled to see Evelyn playing her flute.

<br>
&quot;I suppose we wont be traveling any further than 10 maybe 20 more miles west of here. And you're right, it could be held as an advantage.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked over the map.<br>
<br>
&quot;If we stay in this area, I could send out a group to scout the area to make sure we know everything around us that we can.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udelilahtragedy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Delilah Tragedy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#993300>(8/27/01 3:29:33 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Weather</span><hr size=1> &quot;You may also want to be aware of this..&quot; she said an pointed to a very long, winding river about 10miles to the west. &quot;The rain has probably made it rough and alot wider than normal, AND I would expect there to be very deep parts in it too. We must be careful with that. Either we cross it or they cross it, but we should have some Amazons over there to check it out.&quot;<br>

She looked at the rest of the map, &quot;Anything else to be concerned about?&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udelilahtragedy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Delilah Tragedy</A> at: 8/27/01 3:32:36 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udawnithinia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 310<br> <font color=#993300>(8/27/01 3:59:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Listening. </span><hr size=1>  Dawn listened to Delilah as she spoke of her tiger, she didn't hold control over her specie, she just held their land, their home. <br>

 As she listened to Del and Alysia speak, she slowly drifted into Astral Projection. She would still be able to hear her sisters, and come back to reply. But things in Themiscrya had to be taken care of, she wasn't that big of a fuss, and things needed to be stopped.<br>
<br>
 She was getting very close to leaving Themiscrya. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=180.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=180.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=180.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=180.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=180.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=180.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=180.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a> <b>8</b> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=180.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=180.topic&start=181&stop=194>10</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessage?topicID=187.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showMessage?topicID=184.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=180.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.threadControl?topicID=180.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=180.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=180.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm37">The Mythical Odyssey Forum<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitefrm32">The Mythical Odyssey<option value="amazonsunitefrm35">Amazon Nation Alliance<option value="amazonsunitefrm33">Character Descriptions<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm30">Amazons of the Sacred Circle<option value="amazonsunitefrm34">Amazons of Lesvos Island<option value="amazonsunitefrm38">High Mountain Tiger Clan<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm28">Amazon Sisters of Cremni<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm31">Amazon Language<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6>Amazons of the Northern Lands</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
