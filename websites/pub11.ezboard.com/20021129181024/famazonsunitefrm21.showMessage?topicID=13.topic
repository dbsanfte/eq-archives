She had been intent upon securing an eighth rune marking from Queen Varia's tribe but that was not to be. Hope's own daughter from a previous life Kimbia had appeared to inform her that her plans would fail. Queen Alysia of the Scythia tribe was all too well aware of what Hope was planning and she had plans of her own to stop Hope. A powerful creature had been left behind to deal with Hope near the campfire, but she had used her powers to cause a fire in the Chadesia forest. That distracted her adversaries long enough for her to escape. And now finally here she was after four days travel, keeping off the paths and into the forests near a small stream for water. Hope was entering the Amazon lands of Por Vida in search of the burial grounds. Two more rune markings from the four as yet unvisited Amazon tribes would see Hope's plans a success. She continued her travel toward the burial grounds. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#a62a2a><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udaughterofshylock.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daughter of Shylock</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#330000>(5/26/02 9:31:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Up To No Good</span><hr size=1> And where Hope had gone, Alysia wasn't far behind. She looked to her pack of wolves along with the demonic tiger, her son at her side.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go . .  and by whatever means, stop her.&quot;<br>
<br>
They instantly took off towards the smell of the Goddess, the tiger in the lead. Eventually they came across the human darkness and the wolves encircled her. Each wore a Scynthian medallion around their necks. If they were to kill Hope now and here, she would know that it was Alysia who sent them.<br>
<br>
The tiger slowly paced forward baring it's teeth and growling fiercly at Hope. He had been taught much about the Goddess seeing that Kimbia was an ally, and few of his friends were of Kakos blood, Kimbia's children.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugabbyshope.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GabbysHOPE</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#330000>(5/27/02 12:06:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://images.channeladvisor.com/Sell/SSProfiles/30005913/Images/gabares.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Up To No Good</span><hr size=1> Hope had not expected to be followed. She had kept her intentions of the Por Vida lands unannounced as was her way in previous Amazon lands. The path before her had widened slightly with the water to her left. Almost immediately upon walking forward she had sensed something wrong, and the wolves and this tiger had appeared. <br>
<br>
Scynthian medallions around each of the creatures necks confirmed Kimbia's words from the Chadesia lands. Alysia was responsible for this. Hope frowned. She promised herself to save the lands of Scynthia last in her plans to allow the proud Amazon Queen to see the other tribes fall before hers one after another. <br>
<br>
Hope's ability to control people from her past life was not so well tested on animals, certainly not in this lifetime as the powers of old were not yet mastered. She was unsure if they would succeed even if so. She had never tried to command loyalties of beasts back in the time of her father. And these animals of Scynthia clearly held some manner of loyalty to to Queen Alysia.<br>
<br>
There was one power though that she was becoming increasingly aware, the gift of fire. Had there been but one or two animals here, she would have burned them alive with no sense of moral regret. Hope knew though that with so many, there was no way to attack one without leaving herself unguarded by the others.<br>
<br>
Hope closed her eyes and risked much as she called forth upon the flames of her previous life. The burning hot fire of red yellow and orange lashed our immediately around her. Not to harm the animals but to keep them at bay. A six foot column of flame five feet in diameter surrounded Hope. Any animal to pass through the flames would recieve burns most certainly leading to death. Still this was by no means a victory as she was still surrounded.<br>
<br>
With an uncertainty of just how long her new realized abilities could be focused upon, Hope with a column of protective flame continued her travel down the path near the stream, ever surrounded by these annoying Scynthian beasts..... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#a62a2a><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/udaughterofshylock.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daughter of Shylock</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#330000>(5/30/02 5:40:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Up To No Good</span><hr size=1> As Hope's collum of fire kept Wulf and the pack at bay, another was comming near. The tiger growled lowly trying his best to keep the pack away from the flames not knowing of their creation or what their capabilities were.<br>
<br>
A loud bang was heard and that was the wolves cue. Each one of them slowly began to follow the flames down stream creating lines on each side almost as if to block Hope within the rivers. <br>
<br>
A breaking hole of the wall of fire was formed as a black darkness emerged from it. The bright orange flames were almost fighting against these darker flames. A young woman emerged from the fire and looked Hope straight in the face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your time would come, I told you that before.&quot; Kimbia spoke proudly. She was very sure of herself, her Mother taught her that long ago. She had power, and she knew it. It wasn't a secret what Kimbia had accomplished. The greatest of the destroyers, most powerful, most disobediant, and in the end . . . it was Dahak who was destroyed and not Kimbia.<br>
Her green eyes looked to the waters under Hope as they began to quicken and rise.<br>
&quot;Careful Mother, the stream carried you away once before, but you'll need more than a simple basket to take you to safety.&quot;<br>
<br>
The waters were rushing quickly and harshly now against Hope. Black flames now kept her at bay. She had three choices.<br>
Die by the emerged black flames . . . <br>
Drown in the high waters . . .<br>
Or by some miracle . . . save herself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ugabbyshope.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GabbysHOPE</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#330000>(5/30/02 7:24:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://images.channeladvisor.com/Sell/SSProfiles/30005913/Images/gabares.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Up To No Good</span><hr size=1> Hope was indeed in a desperate situation. Her powers were pressed to an extended time well beyond what she was used to. The use of fire itself only a recent rediscovery and it was not a simple ability to call upon. The added threats of the beasts around her and now Kimbia drew an uneasy burden to her mind. It could verywell be a matter of time with this woman before her exhaustion gave an open opportunity.<br>
<br>
But she was resistant still, even as the flooding waters rushed ever higher upon her. Hope chose do use her powers to free herself from this restrictive hold. Her flames died down and just moments before any likely embrace of dark flames, Hope was under the water. Not of accident but intention. She gave great effort to push herself to the water floor, to grasp ahold of anything to pull herself forward. <br>
<br>
Her powers were used to create a resistant force to hold the black flames at bay. In truth she did not know if flames could exist in water even if godly inspired. It was during those few seconds of distracted thought, Hope felt a sharp pain .<br>
<br>
She lost focus of her surroundings, bringing her hands up behind her head. Something had struck her. The faint thought of a large rock on the water floor. She knew only that it hurt. Hope tried to push forward but she was not the best at watersports. She swallowed a deep breath of water and fell into coughing. <br>
<br>
Hope's thoughts were clouded and lost after that. Brief flashes of water and pain. Precious few seconds of floating above the water to breath deeply of life giving air and then blackness. She blacked out and floated down the Por Vida stream, out of the lands of Por Vida and quickly away from Kimbia and those wretched Scynthian beasts.
