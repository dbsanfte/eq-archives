She was loyal to her Goddess but while on a Mission for the Goddess, Elanis broke her vow to Athena and during a druken night of passion a child was formed. Learning the Father was of a distant land named Arabia, Elanis feared Athena was curse her. So the Priestess ran to hide among Mountains and gave birth to the child and still fearing Athena's disapproval; smuggled herself and the child into Rome. She left the child on the doorstep of a Senator and his wife. Trudius Commodus Falco and Lucilla Aquila Falco. The couple named the new found child, Sarabi Aquila falco. When Sarabi was 6 months old, Trudius died and left his wife to Gaius Aurelius, a Senator as well. Lucilla died of a illness when Sarabi was One year of age. This left Gaius, who had quickly turned into a drunk and abusive man, to raising Sarabi. She was beaten severly and often. Sometimes even forced to watched as her "Step-father" gave into Prostitutes and women of the like.

One day Gaius got it in his head to sell Sarabi to a slave Owner named Proximo Marcellus Prodius. Proximo trained Sarabi and forced her into the Gladiator Games at age 14. When Sarabi was 15, she gave birth to a daughter, Proximo told Sarabi that it was dead when secretly he raised the child and forced her to fight as well. The child and Sarabi never crossed paths though the lived on the same estate. Finally, at age 16, Sarabi escaped with the help of a Germanian named Ryme. She fled to Greece and stumbled upon the wonderus city of Athens. She went to the Temple of Athena asking for shelter. The Priestesses agreed. While staying there Sarabi learned that The High Priestess named Elanis had died of injury from battling.

Sarabi stayed in Athens, finding herself work as a Merchant and Inventor, and soon bought herself a small house. She visited the Temple everyday and greeted the Priestesses and grew close to both Athena and her Priestesses. She was moving on from her past of abuse and pain.

Athena appointed Sarabi her High Priestess, telling Sarabi it was for her loyalty and devotion; when secretly Athena had seen the birth-mark of the High Priestess on Sarabi's neck.

Sarabi of course had never noticed this mark, having long dark hair and never suspecting anything.

Sarabi learned of her identity, and has lived happily. She is 29 years old. Sarabi was walking the outskirts of Greece traveling back to Athens, she came upon a young beaten girl passed out on the road. She took the young girl to a near by Tavern and stayed with her til she woke the next morning. They introduced each other and they both discovered that Nadia, the teen, was Sarabi lost daughter. Since the reunion, Sarabi has taken her daughter to Athens.</span></div>	</div> 	<div id="contactinfo">		<h2>My Contact Information</h2>		<div id="email"><span class="title">Email Address ::</span>  <span class="privatevalue">private</span></div>		<div id="pm">		<span class="title">My Inbox ::</span> 				<span class="privatevalue">disabled</span>						</div>		<div id="im"><span class="title">IM ::</span> <span class="value">AOL - Priestess Sarabi</span></div>		<div id="link"><span class="title">Personal Link ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="" target="_blank">My Personal Link</a></span></div>		<div id="recentposts"><span class="title">Recent Posts ::</span> 										<span class="value">		<dl>				<dt><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessage?topicID=483.topic&index=2" title="post" target="_blank">Re: Finally back in town...</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Sisters of Themiscrya</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showMessage?topicID=483.topic" title="post" target="_blank">Finally back in town...</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Sisters of Themiscrya</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm69.showMessage?topicID=2.topic&index=7" title="post" target="_blank">to the temple</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm69" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Athens</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm69.showMessage?topicID=2.topic&index=5" title="post" target="_blank">Getting Noticed</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm69" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Athens</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm69.showMessage?topicID=1.topic&index=4" title="post" target="_blank">Hey </a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm69" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Athens</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm69.showMessage?topicID=2.topic&index=3" title="post" target="_blank">Ehh</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm69" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Athens</a></em></dd>				</dl>				</span>				</div>	</div>	<div class="spacer"></div> </div>  <!-- profile footer --> <div id="footing">© Copyright 1999-2003 <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/">ezboard, Inc.</a> All rights reserved.</div></div></body></html><!-- CSS:XHTML 2002 JR.o -->
