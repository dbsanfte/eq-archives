<br>
&quot;Its not a threat or a sin...When an Amazon breaks a sworn path of peace, it throws her soul off because it is used to being peaceful. When she killed, her soul became a raging fury not quite adjusting to its new status. But it has now...We are connected because if you traced our blood back far enough, we all came from a set of Tretmolec sisters and the Great Gaia...Gaia, The Mother Earth, is the creator of our people...Through her and our Founding Sisters, our souls are connected...The Northern Amazons are not just ONE tribe...we have many, some are nomads who travel from place to place. Others are stationery staying and claiming one land as their own....Scynthia, Tanais River Valley, Orio-Pata, Eurasian Steppes, Crenmi, Hyrcania, and the Causcaus moutains are all of Northern Amazon descent...&quot;<br>
<br>
It was hard for Greek Amazons to understand, The Greek Amazons believe they come from Artemis and they worship her and Hera, Athena, and Demeter.<br>
<br>
Ardyn kept on with explaining.<br>
<br>
&quot;Northern Amazons believe that Gaia, Mother Earth, created the First Amazons, before she even created the Titans. Therefore, Northern Amazons follow they're Ancestors and call them the Ancients. They respect Gaia but do not worship her because she is their ForeMother....We are not being punished by our dieties, because they are off balance as well....They are very supportive towards Yakut because Yakut serves the Nation with her life, and uses her Shamaness powers to help her Amazon sisters out...do you understand now?..ya see? Its like setting off dominoes. One by one our souls became off balance because Yakut's soul was off balance...&quot; <p>-:¦:- Yakut -:¦:-<BR>

<br>
&quot;Not all Shamanesses are on the path of peace, I'm a Shamaness, and No Yakut lost none of her powers because she was born with them, unlike me and Sana and Lynn, we had to gain our powewrs through divination. Yakut was born with strong powers. She is one of the most powerful Shamanesses the Nation has...Yakut was off balance because her soul had changed path unexpectedly and with out a Preparation Ceremony. She took a life when her path was to save life not take it. You see now? She has something called battered woman syndrome, where if something terrible is happening like Lynn, her daughter, being attacked...something clicks inside her like a switch, when she killed she wasn't in a state of mind to understand completely what she was doing...Her maternal instinct kicked in and made it worse...She was off balance from the sudden turn from her path. She's had her cleansing ritual...her soul and mine and the rest of the Northern Amazons has returned to their normal balance...I'm sorry if this is confusing you....&quot;<br>
