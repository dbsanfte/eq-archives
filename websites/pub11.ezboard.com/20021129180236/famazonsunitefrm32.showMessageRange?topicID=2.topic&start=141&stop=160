He understood the undertones of what his father was talking about, and well, probably no one else did. He smiled and shook the golden hair from his eyes. The only thing he didn't like was the demeaning look Zeus casted over to him after his comment, Apollo chalked it up to Zeus just not having control over his facial features, kind of like his labido.<br>
<br>
&quot;See Calliope, I told you not to worry. My father is a smart man and knows how to handle a situation. Where do you think I got it from?&quot;<br>
<br>
Apollo made is way across the room to Paris and placed his golden arm around the young boy.<br>
He leaned over and shook the hair from his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Quite a responsibility you've got here. Surely you wouldn't want to anger any of these sultry femmé fatals. And I do warn you, oh handsome Paris, son of Pria-&quot; Apollo stopped himself before he revealed the true lineage of the child.<br>
<br>
&quot;Son of Aegaus, these goddesses are well...no goddesses. They WILL, try to bribe you. With promises of fame, riches, knowledge, beauty, and glory, but I suggest you head my warning and decided with your heart.&quot; and with this Apollo poked the young man's chest.<br>
<br>
 He released the boy and walked away, knowing full well none of his words had really gotten through to him. Apollo could tell by the bedazzled look in his eye that this was far out of his league. Perhaps Zeus wasn't as dim witted as he previously conceived. Nevertheless, this would bring about problems.<br>
<br>
He walked to the side of his father and crossed his arms, a smirk playing upon his face.<br>
&quot;Capital idea old man. Capital idea.&quot;<br>
And with that Apollo stood besides his father, the all-mighty Zeus, Lord of the Heavens, to watch a mere mortal judge perhaps history's first beauty pageant. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenhera.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Queen Hera</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 169<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/19/01 8:16:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=143>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Divine Intervention</span><hr size=1> If Hera's eyes could be any colder, she would have frozen the &quot;Sun King&quot; with her look.

Then she listened to Zeus's decision to have a mortal decide on who is the fairest.  Her cold blue eyes turned to Paris.  <br>
The Queen moved with an almost chilling grace towards the handsome young man.  Slowely, she walked around him in her regalness and spoke, &quot;Surely, this young man is wise enough to caste a good judgement over this contest.&quot;  She continued to circle him and then whispered in one of his ears, &quot;To chose the fairest who could give him dominion over the world.&quot;  Her words were quiet so that none could hear.

<br>
'And the bribes start already. Should've known mother would've used her trump card. She's no fool. Never was, never will be.' Apollo thought to himself.<br>
<br>
His cold stare met his mother's as she glided across the room to the newlyweds. He met her with a stare as cold as her's. He had patented that stare a long time ago, and he wasn't about to let ANYONE, and he ment ANYONE, think themselves above him. He cut his eye at her and walked away, surely she knew how down right foolish and childish she was making herself look.  Like a spoiled brat. Who did she think she was, HIM?

<br>
She smiled making her way over to him speaking.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know you shall make a wise decision Paris, for your own good naturally.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her voice was then cloaked and the only one with enough power to hear her would have been Zeus himself, as she spoke to Paris and ONLY Paris.<br>
<br>
&quot;Imagine comming home from battle as the Greatest warrior in the world. With the most strength and skill any man or ~*~woman~*~ has ever seen.&quot;<br>
<br>
She grinned lightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're a warrior at heart Paris, and you'd love to be the greatest.&quot;<br>
<br>
She could already feel him wanting her words.<br>
<br>
&quot;Choose me, and you'll be greater than Heracles. More famous than any mortal ever to step foot on the Earth.&quot;<br>

If she would let such a petty little dispute put a kink in their emmense bond, then so be it. Apollo was far from the mood of going out of his way to appease Athena, she had made her bed, now she had to lie in it.<br>
<br>
His eyes wandered to those of the fair eyed Paris. He saw the grin smear its way onto his face.<br>
Athena had surely bribed him with something trivial, like victory in battle, or endless knowledge. Did she not realize that Paris was a country bumpkin at heart? This was one of the first social gatherings (upper-class social gatherings) he's ever been too. And Athena was promising him things that in the long run, he wouldn't care for. If it had been up to Apollo, and he had been offered the two...he'd of picked Hera's...but what ever.<br>
<br>
Apollo waited for Aphrodite's bribe. Surely she would offer him something of substance, something the young country hick would actually want. Something he could fathom actually attaining. A woman perhaps....<br>
<br>
Apollo juggled the thought as he sipped his wine. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/unikeqofv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NikeQofV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/22/01 9:17:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=156>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.btinternet.com/~dave.newton/lysette-anthony/pictures/lysette-anthony109.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Choosing a Winner</span><hr size=1> ::Nike looks over the entire event, keeping completly silent knowing she played a key role in determining the winner.

Nah, not good enough really. She looks over to Aphrodite. She'll definitely offer a woman, probably a married one. The married women are always the most desirable for some reason. Besides, she doesn't really have anything else to offer because Paris is already handsome. <br>
<br>
::Nike turns her head towards Athena sharp and quickly as her bribing words trickle into her ears, despite th talkings of the room. Was Athena offering Paris victory? She listens as Athena finishes her bribe and steps away from paris. She was, she actully offered Paris glory, victory, and success. Nike crosses her arms and a small knowing smirk touches her lips. Athena was about to learn a little lesson today, which Nike would explain to her later ::<br>

He saw the smirk ride its way upon Nike's face. He put two and two together in his head, and found the equation to be quite humorous. Athena, no doubt had offered Paris victory, and glory. Now Nike must have known this, having that little &quot;psychic&quot; connection with Athena, and was probably purplexed as to how Athena was going to give Paris this &quot;victory&quot; without her gloriful assistance.<br>
<br>
Now, knowing Nike well enough to tell that she was not about to be used, he could conclude that the game was up for Athena. Nike would refuse to grant Paris the &quot;victory&quot; that Athena so ignorantly promised to Paris. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ahahaha, sweet irony.&quot; Apollo muttered as he shook the hair from his eyes. Athena's &quot;Sure to win&quot; bribe was the very promise that was to make her &quot;Sure to lose&quot;. Apollo shook with the chuckles.<br>
<br>
&quot;Foolishness.&quot; Those were the words that escaped Apollo's lips as he shook his head. Athena had just outted herself from this little competition without knowing a thing of it. Nike would not grant Athena victory on this day. Everything was falling into place. Aphrodite was the only one left to bribe Paris, and if she didn't flub it up, she was almost sure to win. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uxgoddessaphrodite.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xGoddess Aphrodite</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 141<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/23/01 9:10:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=158>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.xenafan.com/gallery/if_the_shoe_fits/itsf254aphrodite27.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Getting out the big guns</span><hr size=1> ::Aphrodite slowly and gracefully walks over to Paris and rests both her hands on his right should.

She had done everything perfectly, even the whispering, it was just loud enough for those who were listening to hear. Just the thing to throw Hera and Athena into a blind angry rage. He brought his hands together and clapped. And kept clapping.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bravo! Bravo!&quot; he laughed and clapped as he glided his way to Aphrodite.<br>
<br>
He perked his brow to her, his ever present smirk trickling onto his face. His eyes wandered to Paris, that poor dim-witted boy. Apollo walked to him and offered his hand. The young Paris looked up at Apollo, the god he had prayed to on all those sundays, the day most sacred to Phoebus Apollo. And on the seventh day of each month, where he would cease working to gather hetacombs and sacrafice them in the name of King Apollo.<br>
<br>
His trembling hand reached up and made contact with the silky smooth skin of Apollo. He stood, and found Apollo's arm wrapped around his neck, as if they were old friends. A smile arose to his face, he felt important now. Not just such of a shepherd. He was someone, he was going to live it up with Phoebus Apollo himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Quite a day you've had eh?&quot; Apollo whispered to Paris, as they walked from the halls of the great temple upon the magnificent cliff in which the wedding took place. The two walked far from the temple to a valley about half a mile from the temple itself.<br>
<br>
It was only then that Paris had responded a simple &quot;Yes.&quot; to Apollo's question. He took the whole moment to drink up all that had just happened to him. It was to say the least world toppling to think that he would be chosen to judge the contest. And be bribed along with it. He considered himself a blessed man. He shook the chestnut brown hair from his blue eyes and smiled to Apollo.<br>
<br>
&quot;The made me bribes, Far-shooting Apollo. By some awkward will of Aegis-bearing Zeus, they had chosen me, a mere shepherd boy, to be judge. And it is for you, King Apollo, that I owe this fortune to. If not for you, I would have just been a spectator to this magnificent historical event. All you have done for me is countless Apollo. You have protected my herds, you have guided my from boyhood to manhood. It is by your sweet gestures that my fields grow. By your protection my herds stay safe from the wolves at night. Your wonders never cease. For this I owe to you my mortal soul, Apollo, son of Aegis-bearing Zeus, and the benevolent Titaness.&quot; he bowed his head, duely to Apollo.<br>
<br>
Apollo outstretched his hand and raised the head of Paris, a warm smile on his face. The sunlight glowed behind him. As Paris's eyes met those of Apollo it was as if the god was a painting, like this was all a weird dream. Apollo shook the hair from his eyes and spoke, taking his eyes off of Paris and staring out into nothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is by labor by myself that your crops grow plentiful, your herds protected, and you yourself become a man. These are things that without my help, would undoubtedly happen, but it is by my will that I encourage them. It is I who oversees these miracles, and ensures their happenings. Paris, fair, handsome Paris, it is by will of the Fates themselves that you were chosen on this day. Not even Father Zeus could alter the happenings and orders of the Fates, their word is the last. Your actions today will have repercussions. Indeed they will have repercussions.&quot; Apollo shook his head a bit.<br>
<br>
&quot;But some things have got to happen. Change is apart of the natural cycle of things. Keep that in mind young Paris. For when you are ripened old man, you will need my words. Change is a part of the cycle. Take each lose, and each win in stride. Do not grow arrogance in your advancements, or they will be your undoing. Whomever you chose, I want you to promise me you will chose from your heart.&quot; Apollo poked Paris's chest.<br>
<br>
&quot;For it is from here where Aegis-bearing Father Zeus, and I, Phoebus Apollo, talk to you. It is from you heart all your hopes and dreams come from. But this is not what I brought you out here to tell. I have already gone over that. Paris, whomever you choose today...well...things will happen. Just take them in stride. Now let us go back to the party.&quot; Apollo stood, and again offered Paris his hand. And together they strode back to the temple.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uposeidonkofc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poseidonkofc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 224<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/24/01 12:32:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=160>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Old Slouch</span><hr size=1> ::Poseidon leans back in the chair and folds his arms across his chest while the beauty, how should he say it, pageant continues.
