She puts on her battle outfit, with leathers that covers her stomach. She puts her sais in her boots, her daggers in her holders, her sword on her back and grabs many arrows and her bow. The Amazon prepare her horse, Phoenix, while Maytha gets ready. Maytha gets her War mask of an eagle. With large feathers on it. Maytha then goes and hops on Phoenix. Maytha then rides down to where Hipp, Aly, and the gang will be at. She is kinda sad, that there is a war with the Gods. Hopeing to see her mother Artemis when she arrives. She gallops on down the dirt path and stopped her horse, side by side of the other amazons. Maytha looks at them, and nods. Maytha places a hand on her stomach. is 5 mths pregnant.<br>

<br>
With the great speed she had inherited from....only the gods know who,she was at the site. And what a site. She came up on the amazon side and stood near the queens.Her eyes going from each queen and she offered a lil smirk as her green eyes sparkled with lunacy. She then turned her attention to those gods who she would enjoy later on kicking thier butts.<br>
<br>
Her dark blonde hair flowed slightly in the breeze. She wore she normal attire,that of a red top and black leather pants that had now been pretty much shredded from those spikes that quite often petruded from her flesh,which not only made great weapons but also great armor in such times as war. Her face was painted,not with war paints,but blood,blood which most likely came from some poor peasant. She was even barefooted,she found it much simpler to move about without foot-wear.<br>
<br>
She licks her lips lightly before beginning to pace around the amazons. Back and forth back and forth from one side to the next side of the handful of amazons that had gathered.Her eyes darting here and there taking in her surrounding. She was excited and barely able to hold back her anticipation. <br>
<br>
&quot;Come on come on come on,someone make the first move.&quot; Her hands were flexing,and the veins in her arms visably pulsing,even her temple were pulsing as she ground her teeth in anticipation.  <p>---Everybody Got a sanity------I've got a split personality---</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenvaria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QueenVaria</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="C:/Windows/Desktop/xenastuf/tsianina2.art" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/16/01 9:21:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=c:/Windows/Desktop/xenastuf/tjcontenderpremiere.art WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zelia</span><hr size=1> Varia glanced at Zelia with wide eyes.

She then crosses her arms over her chest,and now her left foot begins to tap on the ground under it. And by now her smile had faded and her hair falling into her face which she blows a little to get it out of her eyes. <p>---Everybody Got a sanity------I've got a split personality---</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uiizeliaii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>II Zelia II</A> at: 11/17/01 2:14:06 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenvaria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QueenVaria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/17/01 2:20:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zelia</span><hr size=1> Varia notices Zelia's shaking hand and quickly offers her a nod instead of a handshake. ~Nice to meet you Zelia...
