She stands there watching the carnage with a Psychodic grin upon her crimson lips,bringing her right hand up to her hip and her left to her mouth,her fingertips placed upon her lips :: mmmmmmm   Sweet Distruction... <br>
::Hearing the screams and watching the blood shead she arches her brow slightly:: hum.. there isn't quite enough..<br>
<br>
::She grins as her eyes Glow white,the lightening streaking across her pupels as she moves her finger tips from her lips and points a a centar,burning him to ash:: <br>
Whoops.. humm.. Burnt horsemen.. nasty smell<br>
::She pulls her sword and Flips into the air as an approaching Centar runs at her,She lands on its back and Headbutts him in the back of the head,they both fall and she rolls to her feet,holding her sword ::<br>
 ::The centar stands and rears back,She rolls under him and thrusts her sword into his stomach as she rolls quickly out of the way of the falling centar::<br>
<br>
::She flips to her feet to see a amazon needing help,she sighs and thinks great saveing this one people will think of her as nice,she thinks for a moment and dosen't want to be thought of as nice,but::<br>
::Rasing her hand the throws a fire ball at the centar Running at the Amazon child and kills it::<br>
::She runs towards the child and picks her up into her arms dodging another centar,she flips the child onto her back and runs towards another child,She picks up the crying girl and kills the centar that was about to kill her::<br>
:::Growls:::<br>
::not knowing what to do with the children she looks to the child on her back out of the corner of her eye:: hold on tight ..<br>
::She puts the other child down and Throws a lightening bolt at another centar,this one bigger than some of the others and with a grey beard::<br>
eh digging in the bottom of the berrel they are..<br>
::She picks up the child and see's some amazons with other childern being saved::<br>
::She runs towards the women and drops the children off::<br>
Okay go on run!..<br>
::She turns faceing the battle and the 5 centars approaching to chase the children and amazons,Her eyes white once again she growls screaming:: When will you ever learn!<br>
::She runs at the head centar and brings her sword towards his head but he blocks with hisown sword,seeing a centar slip past her she flips onto the centar she is fighting and cuts his throat as she throws a lightening bolt killing the one after the children::<br>
::Fliping into the air off the one she just cut she kicks the 3rd one in the face as she lands on the ground she brings her sword into his chest killing him she then runs to the 4th and Slashes his legs as he trys to run by,finally she flips into the air and kicks the last centar that run for the children in the back and flips off him as he lands in the dirt::<br>
::She lands on her feet and glares at him:: I maybe Evil but I sure as hell never Kill children!..::She watches the centar stand and arches her brow at his size::<br>
::She grins wickedly and Slides her sword into her sheath:: okay you and me pal.. one on one.. no sword and no powers..<br>
::She runs at him and kicks him the the face as she brings another kick he catches her leg and pushes her to the ground,he rears up to trample her and she grins,Throwing a lightening bolt at him,making him ash:: humm<br>
Never trust someone that is Evil.. unless they are on your side..<br>

Within her deadly ballet of swift twists and lashing of her Kama's she would leave four Centaurs dead in her path snickering to Calisto before saying~<br>
Well if only I had a gold coin for every time I herd that....<br>
~She whirled to her side sending her foot out to crack her heal against the nose of a oncoming Centaur before she would drive the blade of her Kama down into its forehead, then with her other Kama she would swing it at its neck to lope off its head, flipping backward several times until she stood at Cali's side~<br>
My peace is made with you....but that will be saved for another time...as you can see there is something else we must attend to.....<br>
~After those words she would spot out the corner of her eye a Centaur headed toward the group of children and her eye's would widen as she shouted~ <br>
NO!! <br>
~She would bring her Kama back behind her head aiming ready to project it toward the Centaur but as she held it the blade of the Kama began to glow the very same shade of her Iced blue orbs, and when she projected it toward the Centaur the Kama would loose its natural appearance and was but a slender iced blue glowing ball, whirling with incredible speed at the Centaur, and upon contact the ball would terror through the Centaur as if it were a sheet of paper, the icy blue essence of the Kama seemed to glow out from the Centaur's eyes, mouth, nose, ears, and the wound that ripped through it, entering the front and exiting the back leaving a huge whole within its body, and it would drop dead, but the Kama would curve in mid air and begin to make its way back to its owner. A Centaur that had gotten in the weapon's path would suffer the same fate as the original target, before the Kama would come back to Azz landing in her hand just as she held it before she through it. Leaving a baffled Azz to stair in complete shock at the weapon and what it had just caused, her jaw dropped and she stood there frozen, not believing what she had just done~ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> caiiistoblade</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#993300>(12/15/00 5:56:30 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hey azz!</span><hr size=1> ::As her friend Azz Fights off the centars she turns and See's one headding right for herself,she flips over his head and Kicks him behind the neck landing on the ground behind him,she then looks to see if azz is okay,her jaw almost drops seeing what she did,she then pulls her sword and swings it thrusting it into the fallen centar as she watches Azz,Pulling her sword from the dead centar she slides her sword back into its sheath and starts to walk towards her::<br>
