Just concentrate on your daughter and nothing else. If all else fails and they do try and take her, the Furies owe me a favor and even the Fates can't cut their life cords.&quot;<br>
<br>
She was right, the Furies did owe her. They had always gotten along, but secretly Alysia went to the Alternate Universe after the war and made it possible that if the Furies on the other side were killed, then the Furies on this side would not be harmed in any way. They owed Aly big time.<br>
<br>
She glanced to Meg and Ali.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's get her into the sweat hut. It has been recently cleansed by the Shamaness' and it would be a good place of birthing.&quot;<br>
<br>
She picked up Cora around her arms and watched Meg and Ali help with her legs, all of them carrying her to the Sweat Hut right next to Aly's hut.<br>
<br>
&quot;Everything's going to be fine Cora.&quot;<br>
<br>
She knew that there was a chance of something going wrong, but she wasn't about to say a dang thing at the moment.<br>
<br>
&quot;Get her on that table over there.&quot;<br>
<br>
She pointed to the table that was already set out with a few pillows and linens on it. She wanted to make Cora as comfortable as she could. <br>
<br>
After they got Cora on the table Aly ran out the door and shouted to the village.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lily! Go to my hut and make sure Vyiana is endaski. Sariah! Get in here now, we need an extra Shamaness. And if possible find Genesis or Ariah!&quot;<br>
<br>
She knew that their best bet was to get the experienced ones in there, and figuring that Ari and Gen delivered ever member of the Loire family, it might be of some help.<br>
<br>
Aly ran to a small pond that they had built the hut over and reached a pail in gathering cool water. She then grabbed some cloths that had been soaking in herbal scented water and dipped one into the cold water. She then wrang it out and ran back over to Cora placing it on her forehead trying to cool her down with the cold water and calm her with the fresh scents of the herbs.<br>

<br>
She ran over to the herbs that were being grown in the hut and grabbed a few straight from the roots.<br>
<br>
&quot;It'll be only a moment my LaCa.&quot;<br>
<br>
She cut open an aloe plant and drained it completly into a small mixing bowl and then tossed it over to Aly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Keep this just in case.&quot;<br>
<br>
She watched Aly nod and hold her daughter in comfort as she placed the bowl at the side table.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh Gods. . .&quot; She glanced around trying to find the herb that she and the other Shamaness' had been creating for the event.<br>
<br>
&quot;My Queen, have you seen the Wolf's Blood?&quot;<br>
<br>
A proper name don'tcha think? LOL.<br>
<br>
Alysia pointed over to a small section of the indoor herbal garden. It was heavilly gaurded by wires and magic. Sariah walked over and tried reaching in to get it but pulled her hand back as it burned her slightly.<br>
<br>
Alysia yelled back &quot;Here.&quot; She waved her hand and the herb was exposed to Sariah.<br>
<br>
&quot;Efharisto LaTra.&quot; Sariah reached down picking up the herb. It looked much like a rose only the deepest red any had ever seen. They literally created the herb as a powerful pain killer. The first Epidural heh. Only without the needles. Sariah took it over to the table and plucked the petals all the way down to the core revealing a center that started liquifying mystically. She took a small vile and the red liquid dripped into it quickly before the flower turned to ashes in her very hands.<br>
<br>
She looked down to Cora. &quot;Are you in great pain my LaCa?&quot;<br>
<br>
Knowing that was a stupid question, but they had to know how much pain to know how much herbs to use. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/umegdream.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meg Dream</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#993300>(3/20/01 4:01:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=98.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/xvmegvxwpt/images/meg_02.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Labor . . . </span><hr size=1> She had been under the influence of her mother, who was an expierenced midwife.

And with that, she took the dagger, and cut the cord, handing her to Cora.<br>
