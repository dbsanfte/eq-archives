Her heart seemed to sting with pain as she sat up. It was as she feared. Without her locket, the same curse her blood mother had placed on her effected her here as well. The pain would grow and spread until she couldn't bear it any longer, but it would never kill her. Because her blood mother did not want her to know her true past, she had placed a curse on Sartha as an infant before she was sent to Earth. But something went wrong when she was sent, and she landed on Halon. Because it was outside of Earth's dimension, she was destined to bring destruction upon it all, then have her memories washed away like sand in water. But over the years the magic had faded, and Sartha's will had been so strong as to fight the spell and keep the majority of the memories she had from Halon::<br>
<br>
&quot;Where...?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You are in the village of Halon. You passed out while riding in.&quot;<br>
<br>
::Sartha looked to the doorway where a woman stood. She seemed strangely familiar, but she could not quite place it::<br>
<br>
&quot;But how? Halon was burned to the ground, everyone was killed. No one survived to return and rebuild. I saw it all. So how?&quot;<br>
<br>
::the woman frowned::<br>
<br>
&quot;You seem to be mistaken. Halon has always stood in this very spot for as long as time has existed, which is forever as you know.&quot;<br>
<br>
::Sartha frowned and climbed to her feet, moving towards the door. She is stopped as the pain races through her body sharply, causing her to fall to her knees::<br>
<br>
&quot;You should stay in bed. You aren't well.&quot;<br>
<br>
::the woman moved to help her back to bed, but Sartha growled and pulled away, walking outside and looking around. Young children played in the streets and woman laughed and played tricks on each other. It was the typical Amazon village::<br>
<br>
&quot;This isn't right. Something's wrong. Dekim... he destroyed all of this. They all died. I saw it all. It can't be.&quot;<br>
<br>
::She fell to her knees again and Veyriean seemed to appear beside her as usual. She spoke on a thin mental line, obviously not showing that she was anymore than a simple tiger::<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I've scouted the terrain. There is another camp not far from here. They are all men. But the Amazons I have heard speaking seem to get along with this brother village. It is as if Karathea's tribe never existed. The Queen here is Kianna. I suggest you speak with her.&lt;&lt;<br>

She climed the old and crubling steps and came to the firm oak doors. They were cracked dry and peeling,the hinges rusted and falling apart but not to Shey, she still saw them as newly oiled a deep mahogany and newly tempered Iron.  She slowly and gently pushed the double's open and walked inside.  As Shey walked clouds of dust clouded about the main hall which was in  sad condition.  Tapestries were literally rotting off of the walls, wood was also black with rot whilst the carpets that used to cover the floors were completely gone.

Shey smiled and looked at the large rocking chair that sat on the balcony.  In it was to discarded blankets.  Tears came to Shey's eyes...she thought she had buried this in the back of her mind but it had resurfaced anyway.

Shey wanted to speak more, but the demon turned around and ignored her until nightfall when the stufefd her up onto a horse, tied her feet into the stirrups and her hands to the pommel.  After many days of riding like this Shey longed for feeling in her wrists and ankles.  The cord she was tied with but into her ankles and wrists and the cold weather of the north scalded her skin.  She was the only one not dressed for the weather and she paid dearly for it::<br>

The woman had been silent the whole time and so Sartha had paid no thought to her except that she needed to find a way to get her to safety. The woman was badly injured, but still breathing. Sartha still had no idea who she was, but had not even used the time to look down at her when the sun rose to look at her face. She found herself crouched behind a hut near the ruins of the castle, men swarming the streets already::<br>

&quot;There is a tunnel on the side of the ruins. It was built years ago. When a sorceress was captured and chained as a sacrifice. They didn't know what she was. An amazon, the first in a long time, who was brave enough to despise and disreguard the men, freed her. The sorceress then made the tunnel for them to get safely out. But the Amazon let her go first and the men caught her... killed her... The sorceress went back to the village and told the others what happened and about the passage. No one cared... But it's still there today. I've seen it, and the men still know nothing of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
::The fact that the woman knew so much made Sartha raise and brow and she looked down at the woman in curiousity, only to gasp, her eyes going wide. She placed the woman upon the ground and the woman sat up, raising a brow::<br>
