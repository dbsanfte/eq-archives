He loved the fast paced drama that unfolded everyday upon Olympus, it was a wonder how he did without it for several months. He shook the hair from his azure eyes, his angelic smile playing on his face. Taking a truffle from the pounch on his tunic, he threw it in his mouth and stood up, taking a sip of nectar.<br>
<br>
&quot;I agree, that Hypnos should be punished. But Athena I disagree with you that he should just be punished without trial. It is an unalienable right of man and god to defend himself before a court of his peers. We shall assemble a tribunal, to judge the trial and a prosecutor to question Hypnos and his comrades. Let no one ever say that the god's are a bunch of uncivilized feinds who punish eachother without due course.&quot;<br>
<br>
Apollo's eyes moved from person to person as he spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let us not abuse our power as Olympians. For as Olympians we have a duty to make an example for the rest of the gods and for mankind. The abuse of power would upset the balance which is already dangerously tottering on the brink tyranny up on these heavenly peaks of Olympus our home. The gods are at the appex of the universal triangle, and we must use our power for the greater good.&quot;<br>
<br>
He bowed his head, graciously. Always the eloquent speaker, Apollo hoped that his words would hit his seniors in such a way that they would conscider his proposition for a proper trial. With this he sat back down in his throne. <p>     *~*The Golden God*~*

Poseidon clapped his hands together two times and all those who were to deal with what was just discussed were transported by his power to an open grove in Greece, where the flowers grew wild. Those who sat in their thrones were upon thrones in likeness and those who stood were standing there in the tall green grasses.<br>

Poseidon looked around and lastly to Athena. &quot;Who shall bring the criminals here bound in shackles?&quot; And then he turned to Apollo, &quot;Though the trial will be held, the guilty cannot hope to waylay their guilt but they shall in a civilized manner have a right to be proven guilty which they shall.&quot;<br>

In the back, many thrones were placed, for an audiance if one was to attend. He walked away from his work, and the grove was still alive with more and more objects.

Olympus itself seemed to darken. <br>
<br>
Alecto, Megaera and Tisiphone appeared wearing red strings. . .  and pretty much it.<br>
<br>
Alecto grinned as she swiftly came upon Hypnos as if she were Hermes himself. Hypnos was then tied down with chains of Hephaestus . .  Let's just say that Athena had access to them as of lately. Megaera grinned as she cuffed his hands down to the throne and Tisiphone stood there behind him ready to whisper at Athena's command.<br>
<br>
Most of the Gods knew of the Furies powers. Alecto was swifter and more clever than most, and unlike many Gods, she could freely travel to the Underworld at her leisure. Megaera could morph herself into the most beautiful of creatures, and the most hideous as well, her jealousy was like unto Hera's herself. And sweet Tisiphone whom loved her Mother Gaia so greatly, was the last to come from the blood of their Father. When thoughts of insanity bore in his mind, the youngest of the Furies was born with a curse. Her simple voice could drive the strongest of Gods to their limited sanity. The only one who could not fall into the insanity of Tisiphone's voice, was Gaia herself.<br>
<br>
After Hypnos had been detained, they all turned and smiled giving a bow to Gaia and a nod to Athena and Poseidon.<br>
<br>
Alecto then stepped forward.<br>
&quot;His trial may proceed, and we await orders for a punishment.&quot;<br>

Hypnos woke up a little from his sleepful thinking and gently blew into the air what almost looked like little fire flies that gave off a cloud of blue colored sparkling smoke. Each of these little things went to one of the Erineyes and swirled around them casting the spell of sleep over them, and making them fall into the ground, which suddenly had pillows to rest there head on.*** <p>~*Thè göd ö §|èèp ãñd Ïñspîråõñ.*~

The very actions of throwing over the bench, and the dramatic dropping of the henchmen before Poseidon were all acts that have come to be extremely predictable and characteristic of Hypnos. The balance of hubris seemed to teeter on the brink of complete chaos inside of him. Apollo shook the hair from his eyes and smirked as the Eryines appeared in all their fury. The sun began to set in the western sky as the trial began to take place. His eyes shot to Hypnos who seemed to put on an air of indifference and meloncholy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hypnos, do you not understand why you are here in the first place?&quot; He walked to Hypnos and took the hood from his head, slapping his cheek a bit to wake him out of his presistantly dozey mood.<br>
<br>
&quot;This disgusting display of your &quot;more holy than thou&quot; additude, where in this court it has no place is presicely why you are guilty of defying the universal law of hubris. You are in a court room of your superiors and still you continue to shamelessly flaunt your &quot;powers&quot; of sleep and illusion. Hypnos you have nothing to proove here today, we all have seen hundreds of times your deeds of sleep, and I would appreciate it if you did not use it against anyone in this court today. Grow up and stop acting like a godling. You made your bed, now lie in it.&quot; Apollo narrowed his eyes as he found himself playing the role of prosecutor.<br>
<br>
Apollo turned to Poseidon and Athena as nymphs tried their best at reviving the Erineyes. After phasing into a white toga which he felt was more appropriate for the matter he began to speak.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hypnos you are charged with several accounts of defying hubris. You are repeatedly found to be stepping your bounds as a minor god, taking situations out of your jurisdiction into your own hands and causing many a unneeded conflict upon the snowy cap of our home Mt. Olympus. Your foul sense of judgement and your insatiable appitite for mischeif has landed you before this tribunal here this evening. These acts are entirely seperate from the accounts of your unruly behavior during the Great Amazonian War of late. It has been brought to the attension of many Olympians that you and your motley crew of ruffians trounce around Greece causing nothing but chaos. Before you are prosecuted, I give you this time to argue in your defense. Though it would not do you much good, the crimes have been comitted but nevertheless you have the right to argue in your own name. Keep in mind you are arguing for yourself and the rest of your goons.&quot; Apollo said this with a bit of satisfaction in his voice, trying his best not to sound like a pedagogue. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=hypnos>Hypnos </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.backtalk.org/shadowydreamer/anime/zagato1.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 303<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(7/11/02 6:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=260.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> ***Hypnos smirked and then sighed.*** <br>

&quot;Apollo, Apollo, Apollo... If you think the whole situation over the Amazon civilization will disappear in a few centuries... In that time I could take a nap in that time. But the Amazons struck a nerve. They say its the Romans that turned them into what they are,they say that they want neutrality, but how can that be so when an assassin lives in every other hut. <br>
They should blame the gods, because if the gods love them so much they could of protected them from any of this happening....&quot; <br>

Poseidon acknowledged all those for whom had given him a greeting willingly or unwillingly. Before the sea god did anything he let a few skirmishes and a few mistakes pass him by.<br>
<br>
Sitting there regally on his throne in an uncommonly calm demeanor Poseidon watched as before his very eyes and presence Hypnos insulted his dignity and not just once but many a time. First without any consent to do so, Hypnos weaved his magics on his servants and blatantly dropped them before the gods feet, all in a drows. Then Hypnos came in a prideful way to a trail, as if he were in his pride invincible, though he did not know how much he was not so compared to the might and main of the elder Gods , those who had founded the Olympian Gods. And lastly he sought to make dissention between Poseidon and his own grandmother, one whom he would never willingly seek to harm or upset.<br>
<br>
The powerful God of the sea raised his hand and called for silence. His sea blue eyes rested on Hypnos, the aura of sleep having no effect whatsoever on the god, though if Hypnos willed it so it could. He seemed to be like his brother Zeus now, the cool tempered one with his head straight on his shoulders.<br>
<br>
As he rose the shadow he left behind seemed to remain in his chair, his height seemed to change yet remained the same, but this was only because of the build up of stress within him. Hypnos had struck a cord and there was no telling when the vocalization of  that struck cord would ring loud. He stood before Hypnos, looking down on the thing that he detested, alive and breathing before him and he opened his mouth with his glaring eyes and spoke to the god in a more than moderate tone of voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;You Hypnos have come to be trailed. Do not fret, do not make a show of yourself. You sleep god are standing in the prescence of me, Poseidon, Zeus' equal in dignity and my rights will not be belied by YOU or any immortal here&quot; he said with a deep and calm voice.   <br>
<br>
&quot;Do not undermine the power of the Gods, for you a god yourself have incited a God or gods anger here this day and you seem to forget that none of the Olympians can you contend with and in a court you shall mind your scrupples. And you seem to forget that I can if I would crush you like a gnat, do not be the one this day to be the example to all Gods that a god can and may die. Now if there is nothing further this trail shall begin and you shall defend yourself and call whom you will in you defence, pertaining to your outrageous behavior.&quot;<br>
<br>
The god turned on his heels and nodded to Apollo, galring back at Hypnos for an instant and then plopping down in his throne-like chair.<br>
