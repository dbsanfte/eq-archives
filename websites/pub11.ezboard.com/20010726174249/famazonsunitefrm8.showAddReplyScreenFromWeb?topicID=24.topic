Maytha waits, and then she sets out, &quot;ATTACK!&quot; she screams, and they all run towards them. The Centaurs are in shock of suprise, and one centaur heads for Maytha. He swings his sword and maytha ducks, she grabs his arm flips him sideways. Then she stabs him in the stomach. Some of them that fights show they are not centaurs, but allies of Centaurs, and they help in the battle. One man (not centaur) runs toward maytha, she ducks and he flies over her head. Another man runs to her and she kicks in his kneecap, but then he slashes her leg, she grabs his hand and flips him. Kicks his head and he passes out. Maytha grabs a bow and arrow that was beside a tree. 3 Centaurs charge at maytha, She places 3 arrows in the bow and shoots it. Each arrow hits each centaur and they all die. She checks her wound on her leg, and she runs up the hill, and hides for a sec.<br>

She pushes them, and then she does a spin kick and kicks them both in the head, they flip and pass out. One man charges maytha from behind, maytha turns and swings, but the man ducks, only to see that the man is Agathus. Agathus is a good friend of maytha from the centaur nation, and is also the father of maythas child, shes pregnant with his child at this moment. Maytha seems suprised to see Agathus, &quot;Agathus&quot; she said, and he said, &quot;Maytha....i should have know you will betray your people....you shouldnt even be here, pregnant with out child&quot; he says, he says he betrayed her people cuz she lived with the centaurs as a child. &quot;I am helping my people, but its this centaur who is briging the centaur nation down.&quot; Maytha replies. &quot;Agathus, dont do this, do not fight me, help me&quot; Maytha pleds to him. He looks down for a second, then looks back to maytha, &quot;My grandfather Tyldus died for my people, i intend to do that same&quot; He says. Maytha looks at him with pleds, &quot;Agathus, dont!&quot; She said. &quot;I'm Sorry&quot; he says as he then swings at maythas head, she ducks and then stabs him in the chest. She relizes she killed him and goes in shock. He gives her a look of why did u do this in his eye, he then falls to the ground and dies. Maytha still in shock, &quot;Agathus&quot; kneels down quickly and holds him and checks to see if he is dead and see he is. She begins to cry, &quot;NOOOOOOO!!!&quot; Maytha screams, so upset that she killed her best friend. Cries hardly.<br>

She was going to make one quick appearence. Kill one or 7 centuars, and then blot back home, to prepare for the attacks there. Like Sartha and Hippolyte had said...Dawn could kill half of this army.<br>
<br>
 Dawn walked over a hill into Sarmatia, unsheathing her sword, she raised it into the air, letting out a shrill war cry. Her amazon mask dropped over her face and she ran down into the middle of the battle.<br>
<br>
 First and foremost being greeted by a group of 5 centuar boys, this must have been their first fight, because they looked very sheepish, but very well trained at the same time.<br>
<br>
 'C'mon boys, you know you want a piece of me.'<br>
<br>
 Dawn giggled playfully, as she held now two swords, one in each hand. She took a swipe at the biggest of the boys, as he marched forward toward her. She giggled teasing him as she watched him, swipe back. One sword went out to block the blade, as she stabbed the other through his heart, just as quickly.<br>
<br>
 'Anyone else?'<br>
<br>
 Dawn spoke tauntingly as the swords were twirled lightly through the air, as Dawn quickly brought them through the air, slicing two more Centuars dead. Leaving 2 left.<br>
<br>
 'Aww...I would hate not killing you.'<br>
<br>
 She let out low growl, as the two sword blades came out and into the chest of the animals. Killing them. Dawn turned on a heal, and flipped onto the back of a centuar. Dragging the swords along each side of the centaur's neck. He struggled as it pained him, but finally fell to his knees, dead.<br>
<br>
 Dawn worked hard during the fight, not catching a scratch, only a few bruises. She was there in Sarmatia for about 2 days. After kill almost an 1/8th of the army on her own..she killed one last Centuar as she stepped onto the hill, bowing lightly she turned and walked away.<br>
<br>
 She quietly walked through the woods, watching for anymovement. She wanted to get back to Themiscrya as soon as she could.<br>

<br>
The centaur approached her,his eyes scanning her taking note to the bandage on her right arm,and the dried blood that was around her left shoulder.Wounds from the battle in Scynthia.Kala growled low and charged the centaur.Just as he swung his sword toward her head,she ducked,and rolled to the side.Before the centaur had time to face her,she plundged her sword into his gut as deep as it would go.The centaur groaned in pain,and swung his sword around again trying to hit her before he fell,but she dodged in time,and pulled her sword from his gut.He soon fell limp and died.<br>
<br>
After the centaur had fallen,She looked at the bandages on her right arm,her arm had begun to bleed again,and most likely need stitches,and eventually the arrow head that was still lodged in her left shoulder would have to be removed,but now wasnt the time.She winced slightly from the pain,then growled in anger as she ran back into the battle........ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uamznqnmay.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AmznQnMay</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#8A2BE2>(12/7/00 4:27:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Maytha Continues</span><hr size=1> Maytha still upset that she killed her friend.

A centaur immediatly falls as her sword flashes through the air and through his soft neck, the blood gushing and the head tumbling to the ground. She stops her horse in the middle of the battle, looking around to survey what had already happened. Her silvery-golden eyes narrow, hatred shining within them, the only emotion she ever reveals. She dismounts the black mare, then speaks softly to it and lets it ride off far from the battle, back to Themiscrya. She whirls as a centaur sword comes down upon her, blocking it with the blade of her own and diving back into battle:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#ffffff><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ujetisgallandro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jetisgallandro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#8A2BE2>(12/10/00 4:54:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ::rides up finally:::</span><hr size=1> And no sooner did she enter the limits of the country did she start taking heads. She galloped past a centaur, her fan drawn and pointing outward. Hehad no chance it sliced cleanly off. She followed two speeding centaurs, and witha flourish jumped off her horse and landed on one's back.  She drew her dagger and plunged it into the back of her enemy, and narrowly jumped on its comrade before the corpse fell. The centaur paniced and tried to through her off. But to no avail. She had taken her dagger and cut its throat. But it did manage to throw her off. And she landed on an extremely sharp spike. They had planned to impale someone on this. <br>
<br>
&quot;PADME!&quot;<br>

She cried. Her horse, who had been following trotted up to her. <br>
<br>
&quot;Young friend. I need your help.&quot;<br>

She waved playfully before unsheathing her sword. As the two ran at her with swords on either side, she grabbed both their arms, disabling their swords.<br>

&quot;Now, now.. play nice.&quot;<br>

She frowned as they both swung at her with their other arm, but to no avail.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright, you wanna play? Let's play!&quot;<br>
<br>
She elbowed one in the nose then turned, running her sword through the other. Thick, cool, blood rain over her sword and her hands. With a sneer she put a foot on the centaur's chest and yanked her sword out harshly, before swining it around and beheading the lower, who had now gotten to his feet.<br>
