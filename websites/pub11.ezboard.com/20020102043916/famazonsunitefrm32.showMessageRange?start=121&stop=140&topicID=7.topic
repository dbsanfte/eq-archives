He had little time to worry about her though, as he kept himself engaged in killing soldier after soldier with the merciless fury of his blade.<br>
<br>
&quot;SLICE&quot; was the sound the skin made as Apollo's sharpened blade cut the skin cleanly. Apollo was not one to @#%$ foot around, so he usually just ended his little jousts with a fatal blow to a critical organ or artery.<br>
<br>
High pitched noises. Behind him. Apollo's body whipped around to find an Amazon drop to the ground in agonizing pain. Bloodcurdling screams emitting from her fragile body. Apollo lifted his sword as he turned back around. A blade was on a one way course for his head, but he had intercepted it. And suddenly, the owner of the blade fell to the ground dead.<br>
<br>
Apollo's eyes lifted to find the menacing gaze of Hecate the black sorceress from within the depths of Tartarus. A smile pulled on the his cheeks. And within a small instant Apollo found himself within a barrage of arrows. His shield lifted. He grabbed a soldier and placed the poor breathless bystander in front of him for a more efficient shield. Two for the price of one! Apollo smirked and dropped the body as he caught an opening for an attack.<br>
<br>
Hecate had turned her head. A devilish smirk found its way upon Apollo's face as a arrow found itself in his hand, in the bow, and into the air sailing towards Hecate's shoulder.<br>
<br>
Something behind Apollo sparked his attention. He heard the clanking of armor as a soldier bounded towards him. Apollo pulled an arrow from its quiver, placed it in the bow and flipped backwards. Landing on his feet in back of the now baffled soldier he released the arrow into his neck.<br>

But despite the odds, the queen fought with ease and grace in an almost dance.  The flash of steel meeting the dullness of flesh, the blood spraying forth over the air around her made a wicked scene and sound.  Her body twisted in sure moves to fend off the attackers and to make movement towards them the same.  Her sword soon found it's mark underneath one helmet.  But, lodging deep within the man's throat, it was stuck.  She grimmaced as another sent his sword to slice her hip.  Penth turned to face him and sent her bracer to his face knocking him to the side.  <br>
Her eyes again looked to her lodged weapon and placed a foot upon the gasping man's abdomen.  The movement pushed the soldier off her now free weapon and sent him to the ground to breath his last breath.<br>
The amazon refused to allow the deep slice in her hip to slow her down.  She twisted her body to send the freed weapon to the other soldier quickly meeting him as he moved towards her.  The blade making mark deep within his stomach.  As his body fell free of the weapon, Penth let out a wild war cry.  <br>
Her eyes quickly scanned around the battle and saw a pale horse charging her quickly.  Penth did not have time to see who it was and believing it to be the enemy, she sent her sword to fly quickly at the oncoming form.<br>
The silver of the sword flickered as it flew in the air and then lodged itself into the horseman.  Penth ran towards the horseman as the body fell to the ground.  But, as the dust moved to allow her to find the body, there lay an amazon wearing a war mask.  The sword lodged in the ribcage.<br>
Penth quickly removed the sword and found a cloth to cover the gushing wound.  Around her the world seemed oblivious to the woman kneeling over the fallen amazon.  Holding the cloth tight in one hand, the other gently removed the feathered mask.<br>
A cold chill ran thru Penth's body as she saw the face that lay unconcious on the ground.  The &quot;enemy&quot; she had struck, was the blood sister she had finally found.  Penthesilea trembled at the sight of the sister she believed she had killed.  Brown eyes gazed up at Penth, but did not see.  Blood had begun to cover the ground despite the pressure.  Penthesilea picked up the body that was now growing cold and began to walk somberly away from all that was rampaging around them.  Penth held the woman close and whispered to her softly, &quot;I am sorry Hippolyte.  I am sorry.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/umarpeamzn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Marpe Amzn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/20/01 7:29:02 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/MarpeAmznrpg.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Sister on Sister</span><hr size=1> A dark haired amazon suddenly jumped down from the trees and stood in front of Penthesilea.

As she fell to the ground, her head was hit.  And she blanked out.  For a moment, she almost came to, tasting dirt and looking thru the eye holes of her mask, she could see Penthesilea looking down at her.  But, then she blacked out again as the blood flow was fast from her side. <br>

He road head long toward Poseidon his spear raised as he hurled one yet again his eyes fixed on the god. He road towards the sparkling warrior his Viking braids blowing behind him in the heat of the battle. He knew that he would be unable to defeat the god completely but rather draw his attention from the others. He had nothing against this Greek god but he was too powerful to leave alone on the field. He charged through the blast as he continued on the balls flying let and right the dust clouds engulfing around him but as Poseidon saw he still rode forward. He looked straight ahead just to see the large energy ball coming striking his horse low in the legs.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  His horse dropped forward as it’s leg where incinerated, his body rolling forward as his armor protected him from the rocks on the ground. He felt the pause in the battle turning slowly to look through the masses behind him. He could sense what had happened the leader had fallen; he had broken his promise to Thesus. He turned to look at Poseidon, he now had something to fuel his anger in a battle in which he did not belong. His jaw lowered as he let loose a berserker war cry, the kind that where so feared among his people. His hand pulling the Rune sword from his back, while his other hand pulled up dagger from his boot. His eyes had an inner fire some would never see again on this earth. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He still did not stop as a young soldier clashed swords against him. He was still on a rampage as he stabbed his dagger into his armored belly. His wound bled black a death wound as he reared his head back, bringing it forward with such force it knocked the young man down. He was still in shock from the wound when Alastor took his head. As a gesture he heaved it up landing close to Poseidon’s feet when it stopped rolling. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yet still he continued on the more his rage ensued the brighter the Runes glowed green. He was met by another warrior Alastor not even stopping for this one as he grabbed his sword hand drawing back his blade. It brought it back at an angle splitting the man in two at his hips as continued moving. His jaw dropped again letting loose another scream his eyes moving back to Poseidon. He was to close and in hordes of soldiers from the energy balls now. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He continued hacking and slashing everything in his path as he walked. By the time he came within ten feet of Poseidon his arms were drenched in crimson. He raised his arms as he charged towards him his sword raised and war cry in full tilt. The sword however swelled to the brim with energy bursting into a green flame. He brought his fiery blade down towards Poseidon’s head when he came close enough..<br>

Knowing full well, that if anything happened to her Queen, she would be the one to avenge her, and avenge her she would. She looked over to Pentheslia with narrowed eyes, then dismissed it, she turnd and rode back into the war. She laughed quietly to herself on how Hecate didnt have the guts enough to fight on the ground with the real warriors like evryone else did. She shrugged that off too as a warrior cae after her on his horse, side by side they fght, stabbing and slashing at each other. But DeL got the upper hnd nd beheed him before he could land any more strikes upon her. He fell from his horse with a thud...DeL rode on.~ <p>         ~~* DeL *~~
