She also heard the Roman speak in a slirred tongue.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who is this Solari?&quot; he asked, drunk and angered by anothers name. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm Solari.&quot; She answered deeply, full of anger. <br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you?&quot; He asked, rolling off of Deianeria. &quot;How did you get in here?&quot; He wobbled on drunk legs for a moment before getting his balance back. <br>
<br>
Solari noticed the Roman stood a full head above her and was twice as string as she was. That was no matter to her now. <br>
&quot;I am Deianeria's wife and I have come to take her back.&quot; she answered again, desperatly trying to remain calm. Her hand gripped the leather on the axe once more, ready for a swing.<br>
<br>
&quot;You aren't taking that slave anywhere.&quot; He said poking a finger into Solari's chest. &quot;I have broken women like you before and you will have to kill me in order to take her out of this house.&quot; <br>
<br>
Solari just smirked at the killing part, grabbing his hand then twisting it until it cracked. The Roman gasped at the pain in his hand. He was surprised that the woman before him had great strength. He swung a drunk fist at Solari, making contact with her shoulder as she stepped in to block his blow. She raised the Labyras and brought one edge of the double edged axe down onto his leg, slicing it deeply. <br>
&quot;I could have cut that leg off, but i want you to suffer.&quot; She said coldly as the Roman muffled a groan. <br>
<br>
He began calling out to his guards that were inside the house as he limped over to get his sword off the chair nearby. Solari lifted up the axe and smiled at the ready fight. She stepped between Deianeria and the Roman, so at least she could protect her. The Roman swung his sword at her, having it blocked with the axe, only to recieve another slice to the opposite leg. The more blood that flowed thru his wounds, the angrier he got. The Roman began swinging the sword, Solari blocked the swings each time, knowing that he was too drunk to fight like a real man would. She sighed, knowing that her fun with him was going to bed cut short. He didnt deserve to live after what she had seen him to to her wife. Solari raised the battle axe high above her head, then brought it down onto his, splitting him down the middle. She felt his blood hit her face as he fell to the floor, his body twitching. The guards then entered the room with their weapons drawn. She swung her axe at them, cutting the first one in half, then wounding the other one. She turned around, grabbed her wife, placing her gently over her shoulder, she climbed out the window she came in. She saw that Maximus was there, waiting as he said he would be. He watched as his friend passed him, covered in blood. The guards were alerted and gave chase out the window. They were quickly met with the sword from Maximus as Solari made her escape to the horses. <br>
She reached the horses, placed Deianeria upon the warhorse she was riding and mounted up behind her. Solari reached for the reins to Maximus's horse, then pulled out the bow and arrow set, loading a arrow upon the string as she turned her horse around to head back to help Maximus. She let the arrow flt into a Roman century that was about to land a fatal blow to her friend. Another arrow flew into another century, and yet another. The centuries were only a few in numbers and were retreating back into the house, draggin the wounded with them. Solari tossed the reins to her friend, then galloped off into the night with her wife. <br>
Arrangements had been made earlier, Maximus told Solari to ride out of the city, for they would be looking for them both now. He would meet up with them outside the city at the old church ruins he had smuggled her too so long ago. Solari agreed and left the city, riding until she reached the church ruins. Upon getting her wife situated on a make-shift pile of furs that were there, she got a fire going. <br>
&quot;You are still beautiful my love.&quot; She said softly as she smoothed her wife's hair.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=solariwolf@amazonsunite>solariwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Themiscryian War Queen</span><br>  Posts: 226<br> <font color=#993300>(5/27/03 11:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=462.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Thanking the gods....</span><hr size=1> Solari stood there, in the shadows of the fire, keeping an eye out on anyone that might have followed. When she saw that no one was searching, she turned back to see Deianeria there, laying on the furs. She watched her wife for some time as she slept, then became more alert when she heard the sound of a horse coming down the road. Grabbing the labyrs, she moved quickly to where she could get a better look at who was coming up. Her amazon eyes trained on the shadow moving closer towards the church ruins. Her keen sense of smell told her that it was her friend, Maximus. She waited until he was in the doorway before moving back closer to her wife. <br>
<br>
&quot;I am glad to see that you are safe, Maximus.&quot; Solari said quietly.<br>
<br>
&quot;So am I.&quot; He answered. &quot;The city guards were not alerted, so I feel it will be safe to return.&quot; He reached around and gave her a bag of food. &quot;This should keep you both going until you reach Themiscrya.&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hippolyte>Hippolyte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Platinum Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 978<br> <font color=#993300>(5/27/03 6:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=462.topic&index=17>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.themiscrya.i-p.com/Hippwknife1ezboard.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thanking the gods....</span><hr size=1> Near the Royal stables, Hippolyte poured water over the back of Monsoon.

<br>
Panic began to overcome her again, she had no idea where she was, her vision was still a bit fuzzy due to the blow to her head, but she made out the figure of two people, from the looks of it, a man, and a woman, but the woman looked very, very familiar.

&quot;Yes, it is me.&quot; She said walking over to her, and kneeling. &quot;You are safe my love.&quot; She brushed the side of her face gently. <br>
<br>
Solari turned back to Maximus.<br>
&quot;I am indebted to you my friend.&quot; she replied softly. <br>
<br>
&quot;Solari.&quot; Maximus said joining them. &quot;You owe me nothing. Seeing your happiness is payment enough.&quot; He placed a gentle hand on her shoulder. <br>
<br>
Solari turned to look at her wife. It was still hard to fathom that she was really here. But Solari was bound and determined not to let her anything happen to her beloved again. She looked at Maximus once more and smiled. <br>
&quot;Are you sure you will be ok going back into the city?&quot; she asked. &quot;You are more than welcomed to join us on our travel back to Themiscrya. I can ensure your safe passage.&quot; <br>
<br>
Maximus thought a moment on this offer. He had never seen the famed amazon village of his friend. To see this city was a once in a lifetime sight he thought. He smiled and nodded that he would join them. Solari nodded in return, then turned her attention back to Deianeria.<br>
&quot;Is there anything you want my love?&quot; she asked as Maximus left to go tend the fire and keep watch.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#993300>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#993300> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya>Sisters of Themiscrya</a> <font color=#993300> - </font><a href="http://pub163.ezboard.com/bmythicalodysseyforum">Home</a><font color=#993300> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3m<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
