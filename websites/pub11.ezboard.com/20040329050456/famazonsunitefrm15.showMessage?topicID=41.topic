Something about this Amazon was off kelter.<br>
<br>
The Amazon began walking around the entire tavern circling tables over and over. She was trying to find one suitable, one in her mind clean. Not to say, the Tavern Owner didn't keep up her job but this woman had some major problems. Obessive Compulsive Disorder being one.<br>
<br>
She continued searching for that certain table that was in her sick mind the perfect one to sit at....Yes, she was the strange minority of the ANA.<br>

Sure, she'd seen patrons do some strange things in her day.  This was slightly different, the woman before her circled the room like a cat looking for a place to curl twice around before thinking of sitting, then after all that getting up and starting the whole thing over.<br>
<br>
Her hand was drawn to her lips to hide a smile as this continued.  Shaking her head she made her way out from behind the bar tray in hand a fresh bar towel atop that.  If the woman wasn't going to take a seat, atleast she would get a drink order, perhaps that would help.<br>

In an arm she holds her 17 month old Benjy and in the other Adriana's bag of sanitizing stuff.  She is clad in her usual leathers, worn away by the demands of Adriana.  Her short brown hair, a lock being tugged by her son, is ratted and un brushed.  She spots her boss wondering around like a village idiot and storms up to her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Adriana!  I said wait for me!&quot;  A little fluffy canine follows her, maybe of an ancient race of pomeranions.  She yaps her little self up to Adriana and jumps around her leg.<br>
<br>
Sheronia loudly sighs, placing Benjy down on the floor and instantly pulling out a dampen cloth and quickly rubs down the closest table.<br>
<br>
&quot;There...is this clean enough for you, Adriana?&quot;  she sighs and grabs the hand of her son. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=amazonadriana>Amazon Adriana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#939393>(11/2/02 1:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.hometown.aol.com/amznqyakut1/images/adrianamonk.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ah!</span><hr size=1> Adriana cringed slightly as her Assistant came storming in with her son and that demonic beast. Her green oculars watched as her friend wiped down a table. The OCD Amazon sat down but that bloody animal was still at her feet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sheronia! Please, tell it to stop!&quot;, a whine escaped from her lips as she cowered back from the, in her mind, unsightly beast. Suddenly, she realized the Tavern Owner had spoken to her...Adriana gave off a fake smirk to the elder woman.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi...&quot;, her voice wasn't enthusiastic.<br>

<br>
Adriana triedto flash a sincere smile to thew Tendress but to her dismay it didnt help. Finally, giving up she turned to her assistant.<br>
