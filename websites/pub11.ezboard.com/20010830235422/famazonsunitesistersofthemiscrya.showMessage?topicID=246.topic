It was my duty...my duty as a Queen!<br>
But even if I was loyal to my Nation and to the Virgin Goddess,<br>
I wanted to discover the power of love!<br>
How it is to fall in love for a man...<br>
And at hoped that my exploits at Troy would free me of my military service...<br>
Of my pact of Virginity...<br>

The exalted Greek hero Achilles...<br>

Enemy of our Trojan allies and of my Aryan Nation...<br>

And I fought him in dual...<br>

My bleeding heart,lacerated by a cruel duality!<br>
When he saw my face,he fell in love with me,<br>
But it was too late,the Parques had cutted the thread of my life.<br>

Love is death...<br>
And death is love!<br>
No death is so sweet...<br>
And so crual at the same time!<br>
Love is a murderor!<br>
Eros is a traitor!<br>
But sweetness at the same time!<br>
Passion that even warrior ardor can't equals!<br>
And that discovery costed me my life...<br>

My destiny...<br>

<br>
<br>
The HUnt or Destinys nature<br>
<br>
Still and calm she waits,<br>
sitting in the underbush.<br>
Silence is her partner and wind is her comrade.<br>
Muscles tensed, teeth clenched, she waits.<br>
The damp grass glistens in the morning sun.<br>
There is silence over the clearing.<br>
The warm wind carries the faint voices of birds.<br>
<br>
Her hand touches the earth. The warmth of the wood soothes her.<br>
<br>
Nature is her destiny.<br>
To accept and to give is her nature.<br>
<br>
The leaves brush her skin lightly.<br>
Dark eyes are fixed on dark trees.<br>
Soft hair flows against tanned skin.<br>
She waits.<br>
<br>
There, in the peace of the silence, a deer,<br>
young in years,<br>
brakes through the underbush.<br>
Muscles tense<br>
but STILL she waits.<br>
<br>
Still fingers close around a wooden root. The bow lifts and its arrow points at the wild creatures heart.<br>
Though,<br>
she waits.<br>
<br>
Eyes and arrow are fixed on the being.<br>
<br>
Long, soft brown legs wander through glittering grass.<br>
Soft lips nuzzle the ground underneath.<br>
Hairy ears move from the left to the right,<br>
taking in every siound.<br>
But there is silence, peace.<br>
There is no danger.<br>
It stalks around the tree-surrounded-spot.<br>
<br>
It is one with it’s mother.<br>
It is one with nature.<br>
It IS peace. <br>
It is calm.<br>
<br>
And she still waits.<br>
<br>
Every muscle is tense.<br>
Strong fingers hold the bow. The arrow tip follows the moves of its prey.<br>
<br>
She is one with her mother.<br>
She is one with nature.<br>
She IS peace.<br>
She is calm.<br>
<br>
Eyelids close over piercing eyes.<br>
She takes in the scent of her surroundings.<br>
Her heart is at total peace.<br>
<br>
Peace with her mother.<br>
Peace with nature.<br>
Breathing the same rhythm with her long, legged sister.<br>
Peace within herself.<br>
Peace with her sister.<br>
<br>
It takes in a deep breath, recognizing its sister.<br>
There is no danger, only peace.<br>
Its heart is at total peace.<br>
<br>
Peace with its mother.<br>
Peace with nature.<br>
Breathing the same rhythm with her hidden sister.<br>
Peace within itself.<br>
Peace with its sister.<br>
<br>
Her tensed muscles calm down, after releasing the arrow. <br>
Dark eyes catch deep brown ones.<br>
There is NO anger, no fear, no regret.<br>
Only peace,<br>
With nature, their mother and themselves.<br>
<br>
A soft THANK YOU is spoken between the two sisters.<br>
They breath in rhyme<br>
Until one breath fades out.<br>
<br>
The huntress stands up and long legs make their way towards the dead body.<br>
Life had left its corpse and had gone back to its roots, back to its mother.<br>
<br>
Dark eyes soften as tanned arms pick up the sister.<br>
A faint smile lays on red lips as the huntree carries away her prey.<br>
<br>
The clearing is left alone. There is no other sound than the faint whisper of birds songs.<br>
There is peace again. Peace is nature.<br>
Nature is the mother. The mother of all.<br>
The mother is at peace with her children.<br>
They have to learn to accept and to give.<br>
THEN, and only then, they will be at peace with themselves.<br>
<br>
And when they reach this level,<br>
They will become one.<br>
<br>
One with their mother.<br>
One with nature.<br>
One with all their sisters.<br>
<br>
And finally they can rest.<br>
They ARE peace.<br>
That’s when they are back to their roots. <br>

(by Queen Hippolyte)<br>
<br>
::::Hippolyte sat before the group of young children, holding in her arms her own youngest child. As the flames from the firelight danced on her face, she began to recall in her own bardic way the rise and fall of Themiscrya so long ago.::::::<br>
<br>
The fires of the night had grown strong<br>
We danced and made song<br>
For tonight we did celebrate<br>
A gift from the Goddess great<br>
<br>
A Daughter to the Queen<br>
A joy to all who had seen<br>
A child shaped from Clay<br>
Amazons would rejoice the day.<br>
<br>
The Queen stood proud<br>
She praised Hera, her chants loud<br>
A Nation with pride<br>
A City would claim it's right.<br>
<br>
Then they came in the shadows<br>
Hooved feet and bows and arrows<br>
Fire flew thru the sky<br>
The dark night began to cry.<br>
<br>
The Queen's guard quickly taken<br>
Amazon's scream and shaken<br>
Took their bows and swords<br>
To defend their home against this horde.<br>
<br>
The child in her arms<br>
The Queen fought long and hard<br>
With Smoke and Flame filling the air<br>
Hippolyte returned to her lair.<br>
<br>
Amazons lay about the steps<br>
As Hippolyte ran her heart did fret<br>
In her hut for she did find<br>
A Centaur held her love in bind.<br>
<br>
The blade met the love's skin<br>
Blood flowed down to meet other kin.<br>
The Queen's scimitar soon made it's mark<br>
Deep within Centaur heart.<br>
<br>
Stepping out of the falling timber<br>
The Queen's eyes found not a member<br>
The Heart of a Nation once proud and strong.<br>
Now looked to all dead and gone.<br>
<br>
She walked out into the night<br>
The child in her arms full of fright<br>
The Queen in the forest quiet<br>
She looked for her sisters with all her might.<br>
<br>
Night and Day she traveled east<br>
For she would not accept defeat<br>
To a village she knew her sister dwelled in<br>
A sister, a queen of the Crimson Stone, Eponin.<br>
<br>
Once found in her sister's embrace<br>
The Queen found some solace<br>
For assembled within this fortrace place<br>
Were Themiscryans meeting again.<br>
<br>
Together again, they talked and bonded<br>
To a future and pride their hearts did long<br>
To reclaim their home and forests to gain<br>
The City of Amazons would rise again.<br>
<br>
These sisters one night did join as one<br>
With the aid of the Crimson Stone<br>
They forced back the villians hooved<br>
Centaurs to their dark mountains moved.<br>
<br>
A desolate village they did not see<br>
To rebuild with heart and glee<br>
For soon it grew both great and strong<br>
Again a village of Bardic song.<br>
<br>
The Queen with child in arm<br>
Watched the City again Strong<br>
Her sisters proud did rejoice<br>
For they had made a choice.<br>
<br>
Never would fall the City of Amazons<br>
Never the Nation to shake<br>
For together they would stand United.<br>
Themiscrya not more to Take.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=daphnikearephiparthenia>Daphnike Arephi Parthenia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#993300>(7/24/01 9:20:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mrmagoo.fortunecity.com/royo/secret/secret03.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Rise and Fall of Themiscrya</span><hr size=1> Wow, that's a wonderful poem! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=vivianquest>vivian quest</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#993300>(8/15/01 11:06:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Come and See</span><hr size=1> ::one night while there is much drinking and merry making among the sisters at the tavern in a gathering moved outside around a bonfire to take advantage of the cool night air....one lone voice and the sounds of a lute sound over all other sounds bringing a quiet as they listen to Vivian sing......::<br>

Come my sister and see the dawn<br>
The image from which our life is drawn.<br>
The light with flowers bloom<br>
And day creatures come from the night gloom.<br>

Come young friend from you hut and see<br>
the wind come through the &quot;Forest Sea&quot;<br>
to greet us with the Morning's cool touch so soft<br>
for you and me, and the young lovers in the loft.<br>

Sweep over the world does Gaia's hand<br>
bring sweet life upon the land<br>
Nature's way again this way<br>
we can see it as the trees, they sway.<br>
<br>
Come my sister and see the storm.<br>
The air is cool but the wind is warm.<br>
It's light and thunder are coming now<br>
Come see the life's rain coming down.<br>
<br>
The animals now take to the ground.<br>
In there burrows and hollows they can now be found.<br>
For now to Gaia's music they shall nap in peace,<br>
Until the rain does cease.<br>
<br>
Come my sister and see sun's set.<br>
As day says to night &quot;Hello and well met&quot;.<br>
Then shake hands as each passes by.<br>
Night says hello and day says Good Night.<br>
<br>
Now the moon has come to see,<br>
the slumbering one of the &quot;Forest Sea&quot;.<br>
The night pale eye, give soft white light,<br>
As night birds sing and dreams take flight.<br>
<br>
Now come my sister and bring your drum.<br>
For soon the Dawn it shall come.<br>
Tomorrow we may die before we wake,<br>
so let us enjoy this final day.<br>

And darkness can't defeat me!<br>
And the weather calms down<br>

Flowing in a tumultuous cascade, whirling<br>
Seeking to pour itself in the ocean<br>
I come from the halls of Time<br>
Seeking for my lost village<br>
To rebuild my Nation and be a proud Daughter of the Moon<br>
And like the Time<br>
Nothing can stop me in my furious run<br>
