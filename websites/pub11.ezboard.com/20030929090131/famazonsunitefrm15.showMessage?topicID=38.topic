<br>
Goruka smiled. His face today like any other day had black paint markings. A black line running down the right side of his face. His long hair,which fell just an inch or so past his shoulders was sectioned off from the top of his hairline to the middle of his head and tied off. Leaving the lower portion of his hair to freely sway about,while the top portion was secure so it wouldn't stray.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
He entered the establishment,that smile still upon his ebony painted lips. He closed the tavern door behind him,then placed his folding staff near the door. His emerald colored eyes gazing upon the inside of the tavern as he slipped his heavy trench coat off,and hung it on a hook near his staff.<br>
<br>
Once the trench was removed,more black paint markings were seen upon his right arm. Just simple little lines and dots that to the naked eye,meant nothing.<br>
<br>
He moved through the tavern to the bar,where he immediatly took seat on an empty bar stool. He looked from the left then to the right,seeing there weren't many people in the establishment. He smiled once more,then turned his gaze to the tavern attendant who was working the bar.<br>
<br>
&quot;Excuse me.&quot; He said,while bringing his right hand up to try and get the tavern attendants attention. &quot;If I may get some service.&quot; He waved his hand slightly,then let it rest down on the bartop next to his left hand,waiting for the bar tenders attention. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ucyreneraven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cyrene Raven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Owner and Merchant</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#939393>(9/20/02 8:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=38.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/cyreneamphipolis/cyrene005.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: In For Food and Drink</span><hr size=1> Cyrene glanced up from behind the bar and wiped the sweat from her brow.

<br>
Sion moved into the Tavern, quietly. He moved stealthly and still like a panther readying to pounce its prey. The Dark Man slipped into a seat with an demonic smile. <br>

For a short moment,Goruka took his eyes off Sion to look over and notice Kaeira,he offered her a charming smile,sencing something about her. However,at this moment,Goruka was interested in knowing the sacred item Sion was to protect,so he returned his attention back to the older man. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uxplacidstormx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>XPlacid StormX</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#939393>(10/17/02 4:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=38.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/amznqyakut1/images/h04.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Oooo.</span><hr size=1> If, Goruka had noticed, Sion had never blinked.

<br>
A chalice of chianti materialized before the Cannibal, as well as a plate of a pasta, with a very interesting meat...one could only imagine. Sion brought the wyne to his lips taking a sip before setting the glass down. He savored the crimson liquid before swallowing and running his tongue over his teeth. He breathed in smelling the wonderful food before him, and he sighed contently. <p>÷Sion Anthony Lecter÷<BR>÷Demi-God, Cannibal÷<BR>"It pains me to think I no longer can enjoy your full confidence..."</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uvvvthegoddesshecatevvv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VVV The Goddess Hecate VVV</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.cybercomm.net/~grandpa/euterpe.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 130<br> <font color=#939393>(10/18/02 10:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=38.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.jonathonart.com/LotusMaiden1/dark1s.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hecate</span><hr size=1> in the corner appeared hecate, dressed in a sheer black gown that sparkled when light hit it. in her hand she held a goblet of necter. seating herself at a distant table, she sat in silence watching the three presently in the tavern.<br>
a small tiger snake slithered down her right hand and about her head was a crown of oak leaves.<br>
her eyes were all that could be seen in the taverns dim light, two electric blue cold eyes piercing through the darkness <p><a Target="_top"

<br>
Pushing away from the wall that was her hiding place, the tendress lifted her chin high and moved past the two dark ones.  Silently filling their drinks and clearly avoiding the plate of food infront of the older man. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uxplacidstormx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>XPlacid StormX</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#939393>(10/20/02 5:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=38.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/amznqyakut1/images/h04.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hmmm.....</span><hr size=1> His stealthy hand reached out took a utensil, the fork, and pierced the food before him.

Then, setting it down on the table next to his plate.<br>
<br>
His own ice cold blue oculars never left Goruka this time, he could smell Hekate...every little smell registered in his brain and was moved aside for later preferances. <br>
<br>
&quot;And yourself, Goruka? What has the Great dark Lord asked of you?

<br>
&quot;Excuse me, ma'am? May I get something to eat and to drink?&quot;<br>

Yeah, Kaeira was as polite as they came, but...there was something about her that would send a chill up anyones spine, even the darkest of people. <p>~ Kaeira Valerian ~
