<br>
Last night there was a raid into the Tower of Frozen Shadow that became something I never intended it to be. It became a rallying point for Darkaura's departure, Elilan and Whispe felt not included and turned away and others stood by their side to defend them.<br>
<br>
A lot of people got hurt by decisions that were made last night and others got hurt because they saw their friends getting hurt. Pointing fingers can be done by anyone in this situation and I am sure right now there is a lot of "he said...." and "she said...." floating around in our collective minds, posts, in-game chats and so on.<br>
<br>
BUT AS OF THIS MOMENT......ALL OF THAT WILL STOP.<br>
<br>
It was my raid to handle, it was my raid to run and my raid to accept any AND all consequences for decision. THESE DECISIONS WERE MADE BY MYSELF AND ALTHOUGH I REPRESENT THE GUILD OF MYSTIC ENTITY - I MUST ACCEPT MY FAILINGS AS MINE AND NOT MY GUILD'S.<br>
<br>
1) I was held up getting to the raid site because of family holiday gatherings and did not get to the raid until 10 mins prior to the start of it.......THIS CREATED IT ALL. Rehterah, Hopes and others tried fielding the questions, the tells and the requests for who was going and who was not until I got there and I appreciate their efforts. BUT, I should have been there to do it.<br>
<br>
2) I came to the raid with a list of people I had collected the night before from the raid posting.......apparently others in game before I got there had /guild requested that they be put in...unfortunately I was not here for that because I was late....and that information never got to me. So when the raid grew to 4 groups. I had to close it to any more add-ons. We simply did not have enough keys and I was getting uncomfortable with leading a raid that large into what can be a very confusing place.<br>
<br>
IN NO WAY...did I mean to offend, turn away or upset anyone at this point. I got logged on and got to the camp and immediately had 3 full groups...within 10 mins I had 4 groups and requests to join kept coming in. Everyone who was on that I spoke to (my guildmates Rehterah & Hopes were trying to organize until I logged in - and the GL's from DRoP and Benevloent order) seemed to have a different list of guildmates and friends who said they were coming and NONE of the lists seemed to be the same. I tried to corellate them all and make as many accomodations as possible but because I had to get the raid organized and moving - it was just impossible. I probably should have done more or made more prudent decisions....and for this I apologize.<br>
<br>
* * * * * * * *<br>
<br>
I let all of this confusion affect me, affect the raid organization and it became increasingly difficult to keep everyone focused on the raid and problems started arising IN the raid. THAT is when I had to stop it. This was the WRONG decision but one I made, stood by and followed through. <br>
<br>
I was not going to call SNORK in to take it over nor was I going to place the raid in someone else's hands. Perhaps this is because of pride, perhaps this is because of my own hardheadedness. BUT had I given over leadership to someone else.....they, too, would have been flooded by tells, guildchat or otherwise about ....."but he did this" or "he said that" or whatever and although I completely trust those that offered to come in and help and their abilities to do so - I DO NOT EVER want to have someone else clean up my messes.<br>
<br>
* * * * * * *<br>
<br>
IN closing I would just like to say this.....I have learned some lessons about larger raids that I never expected I would have to learn or even exist. I will be better next time. I will run raids that are as fun and organized as the others I have done.<br>
<br>
BUT most importantly....and I apologize that it was at the expense of some of my closest friends, my "guild-family" and relationships between guilds....I have learned the importance of communication and how the lack of it can bring down something to a level it was never intended to be at.<br>
<br>
* * * * * *<br>
<br>
On a positive note......ALL of the attendees who made it to the 3rd floor mentioned to my guildmates or me that B.O. was awesome and in particular, Gokulot rocked with his multi-group pulling assignment....I could not agree more, AWESOME JOB, GOKULOT !<br>
<br>
* * * * * *<br>
<br>
* WAS this raid too big? Yes...<br>
* WAS this raid too difficult at this size for being my 3rd raid lead? Yes...<br>
* Were there many HARD lessons learned from this? Yes...<br>
* Should this effect your perception of Mystic Entity? I would hope not.....if there is any person to blame or lack of confidence to be directed at any individual or entity.....let that blame and lack of confidence fall on my shoulders, not my guild....BUT I promise you this, I WILL gain your confidence back !<br>
<br>
*In sorrow, with a heavy conscience and my deepest Apologies to all who attended - I kneel before you*<br>

<br>
   Actually it does.<br>
<br>
   You ran into problems and chose to look for solutions rather than execuses. You accepted responsibility rather than distributing blame to others.  <br>
<br>
    I respect that.<br>
<br>
   I rarely care who was to blame. I'm much more interested in knowing what is planned to correct the problem to lessen the chance of it reoccurring.     <br>
<br>
   I have been away for awhile and have not had opportunity to meet many of your guild. I have only met a couple, Hopes  ( If she remembers) Snork, and a few others briefly on Gokulots Lucan raid. The ones I have met I would be honored to be accepted into a group with. <br>
<br>
    Has your posting today affected my perception of your guild? Yes<br>
   <br>
    Has it changed my peception of your guild? No...<br>
    it has reinforced it. <br>
