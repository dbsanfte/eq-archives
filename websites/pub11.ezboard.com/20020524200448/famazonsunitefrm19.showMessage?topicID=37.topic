Having just passed through the lands upon this very same road, she had not wanted to attempt her goals then. Her victory in the lands of Themiscrya were too close and with so many lands to choose from there had been no need for risk. But now...now she was ready. She stood upon a forked road leading in three direcitons, from Themiscrya to the Northern lands and Orio-Pata.<br><br>Hope rested against a large flat rock which divided the road into three directions. Her thoughts were divided as well. So many days from her inherited lands of the Diaprassea vineyards. Time spent from her reawakening memories of so long ago, time which might be spent securing a temple with followers. Time from Ares and from her mother. But she would have her say in Amazon issues of importance. She was determined in that. This plan of hers would work. It was just a matter of planning and patience.<br><br>This was the rumored location of the Orio-Pata Queen's downfall. Hope did not know the specifics of her life's end but Hope knew that Dawnithinia Rivent Darkshade was a powerful well respected leader. She did not know of the current leader. Her paid informants had not yet reached her with such information. Perhaps she would disipline them in her own preferred way. Just as well as she had no eventual intention of paying them for their services. <br><br>As she stood there against the rock, Hope looked down to notice the faintest of reflections under the grass at the base of the rock. She curiously looked down and reached to the grass. Her own goddess powers must have alerted her to an uncertain mystical influence there. Almost as if the Orio-Pata Queen had left a presence behind. There was the unmistakable presence of a runic mark to this location. An Amazon had died here afterall, and this stone.. it was essentially a marking.<br><br>Had the Amazon Queen Dawnithinia Rivent Darkshade owned any kind of rune weaponry, jewelry or other possessions? If so... and if she had them with her at the time of her death... here... then this entire rock could be considered as a burial marker. The very item Hope was searching for.<br><br>A light uncommon smile played across Hope's face as she realized further trips into the Orio-Pata lands were unnecessary. She stood up and walked away from the great stone. With some concentration, a small section of the stone broke off. Hope used her powers to further break the small piece into an even smaller more easily managable size. She pocketed the stone piece and took one last look around the area before travelling to her next destination. The Amazon lands of Chadesia.....<br><br>1st Rune ~ Paphos Tribe<br>2nd Rune ~ Myrine Tribe<br>3rd Rune ~ Nomain Tribe<br>4th Rune ~ Smyrna Tribe <br>5th Rune ~ Sacred Circle Tribe <br>6th Rune ~ Crimson Stone Tribe<br>7th Rune ~ Orio-Pata Tribe  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uauthenticpansy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AuthenticPansy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#939393>(5/20/02 3:16:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=37.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Up To No Good</span><hr size=1>  But the stone did not budge, it didn't go with her. The Orio-Pata village had been spelled and protected not by Dawn, but hundreds of demonic tigers, and spelled by the Shamness and Goddess Delilah. There was no way, Hope was leaving with anything out of Orio-Pata. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=37.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=37.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=37.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm19.threadControl?topicID=37.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=37.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=37.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub11.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="amazonsuniteamazonsunitescrollboard">Amazons Unite Scroll Board<option value="amazonsunitefrm37">The Mythical Odyssey Forum<option value="amazonsunitefrm23">The Olympian Gods<option value="amazonsunitefrm15">Black Sea Tavern and Inn<option value="amazonsunitefrm32">The Mythical Odyssey<option value="amazonsunitefrm35">Amazon Nation Alliance<option value="amazonsunitefrm33">Character Descriptions<option value="amazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya">Sisters of Themiscrya<option value="amazonsunitefrm6">Amazons of the Northern Lands<option value="amazonsunitefrm8">Amazons of Sarmatia<option value="amazonsunitefrm20">Nomain Amazon Tribe<option value="amazonsunitefrm10">The Tribe of Lykastia<option value="amazonsunitefrm4">Sisters of the Crimson Stone<option value="amazonsunitefrm16">Amazon Sisters of Smyrna<option value="amazonsunitefrm19">Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata<option value="amazonsunitefrm21">Amazon Sisters Por Vida<option value="amazonsunitefrm30">Amazons of the Sacred Circle<option value="amazonsunitefrm34">Amazons of Lesvos Island<option value="amazonsunitefrm38">High Mountain Tiger Clan<option value="amazonsunitefrm25">Amazons Loyal to Artemis<option value="amazonsunitefrm26">Amazons Of Myrine <option value="amazonsunitefrm27">Sisters of Paphos<option value="amazonsunitefrm29">Amazons of the Tanais River Valley<option value="amazonsunitetributestoephiny">Tributes to our Athelfi<option value="amazonsunitefrm9">Amazon History and Myth<option value="amazonsunitefrm31">Amazon Language<option value="amazonsunitefrm7">Amazon Bardic Works<option value="amazonsunitefrm18">Amazon Personals<option value="amazonsunitefrm39">Guild Applications<option value="amazonsunitefrm40">Sisters of Chadesia</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#939393>- </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite>Amazons Unite</a><font color=#939393> - </font><a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm19>Proud Amazons of the Orio-pata</a> <font color=#939393> - </font><a href="http://www.amazonsunite.i-p.com">Home</a><font color=#939393> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- Begin BOTTOM AD Script --><div align="center"><script language="javascript"> document.write(adbottom); </script></div><!-- End BOTTOM AD Script --></CENTER><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
