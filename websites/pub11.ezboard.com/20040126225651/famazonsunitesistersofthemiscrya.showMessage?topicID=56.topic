The door to the hut makes an eerie noise as it creaks open. Skye's ears perk up as he notices the fresh air hit the room. He wasn't allowed to venture out on his own yet. Sethra said soon, but she was afraid he was too young and small and didn't want him to get hurt or eaten by predators. His curiosity overrides morals and he gets up and starts sniffing his way to the door.<br>
   He knew there was a big tiger cat out there and also a wolf. He thinks to himself...maybe they will be friends and play with me.... He pushes the door open the rest of the way with his nose and starts out looking for those two. As he goes along, he carefully marks the trees along the way so he can find his way back....I got to be back by sun up, otherwise, She will be mad at me....

As he was about to finish off tearing the cloth to pieces. . he smelled something..a. . a. . . canine of his own. Well not really of his own. This was no wolf. He ventured out of the hut. He glanced around being very quiet as he watched the pup. He followed it for about 100 yeards before he slipped and landed on one of the young amazon girls camp out. The Amazon girls screamed being woken up and he began barking in fright running towards the pup. He jumped over the little dog and hid behind it. Not doing a very good job might I add.

Suddenly he hears a scream and jumps from fright, actually all four feet off the ground. He turns to see what it was and doesn't see anything except a big barking wolf charging. He tries to turn, thinking he was in danger but the wolf ran right up and over him. Skye slid into the wolf and realized the wolf was hiding. &quot;hmmm, must be like me and hides when he's about to get yelled at. I hope my master didn't wake up.&quot;<br>
 After the young amazon settled down once again, he turns and sniffs the wolf's face. Sensing the wolf was friendly, he relaxes a bit. Skye noticed too that the wolf seemed to have a strong power within him, almost magical. &quot;must be my imagination&quot; He thought to himself.<br>
  After he was done sniffing, he sits up and just lookes at the big strong wolf. :: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=scynthianwolf>Scynthian Wolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#993300>(10/19/00 11:25 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ::blink::</span><hr size=1> ::After the amazons went back to sleep he opened his eyes and stared at the young pup.

The rucuss below her in the Tavern had awoken her from the deepest slumber she had accomplished in a long time. To tell you the truth that's why she slept in the Rafter of the tavern, it had a great sleep effort. As she fell into the air, her body falling at a rapid pace she rolled into a summersault, letting out a soft war cry. <br>
<br>
&quot;I! Iiii!&quot;<br>
<br>
 She landed atop a table, no sound emitting from her feet as she stood. Only a soft shing was heard as her sword was unsheathed and she looked at the animals. Her face was angry as she looked to the wolf and dog. She spoke in a whisper, but an angry whisper at that.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Eating the nutbread again?&quot;<br>
<br>
 Her green eyes went to the wolf as she growled lowly, her eyes turning that a wolf, it gave full perpous for showing the animal her soul was part wolf.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I'd be ashamed if I were you. You are an animal of Aly's pack, and should not being doing this. We Amazons work hard to make that nutbread and don't need you eating in the middle of the night.&quot;<br>
<br>
 She growled again.<br>
<br>
 &quot;How would you like it if I took your fresh kill, right after you killed it?!&quot;<br>
<br>
 She then looked to skye, remembering the trip back with Hipp and Sethra. The hard work they all went through to get back because of the Romans. Dawn knew what the dog ment to Sethra.<br>
<br>
 &quot;And you....I suggest you keep yourself out of trouble, before you get Sethra into trouble because of your habits.&quot;<br>
