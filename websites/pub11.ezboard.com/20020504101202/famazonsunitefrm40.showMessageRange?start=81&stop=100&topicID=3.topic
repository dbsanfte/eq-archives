<br>
She grabs a roman by the collar and slams him hard against a wall,then turning in time,to punch another right in the nose. <br>
<br>
She manages to keep her attackers at bay long enough to catch a glimpse of Maytha with an unconcious woman,and Varia taking off for the gates.<br>
<br>
Using her [Herculian] strength,she throws a roman away from her,then another,as they again started coming at her. 'Things sure are tougher when trying not to kill' she thought to herself.She jumps back,evading a low blow from a romans sword. &quot;All this for one prisoner!&quot; She griped outloud then slammed a fist into the sword handlers face. She then ducks quickly as another romans sword came toward her head,as shes crouched down,she spins around,and slams a fist into the romans gut,knocking the air right out of him.<br>
<br>
Catching a glimpse of Fogstone now,Zelia leaps over anymore attackers,then charges toward the city gates. As she reaches Varia and the others,she looks at the mass of flaming electricity. She skids to a stop just intime to save herself from becoming flaming electric toast [hehe]. The brightness of that explosion was acctually strong enough to blind her,even with her protective lids over her eyes.<br>
<br>
She groans,and rubs her eyes intensly,trying to rub out the burning pain in her eyes,and the blindness. <br>

With very blurred vision,she looks toward Varia and the other,though slightly off her marker,and slightly looking to the left of the small group. &quot;There has to be another way out....??&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uqueenvaria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QueenVaria</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://hometown.aol.com/variaavande/images/tsianina2.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 321<br> <font color=#993300>(3/3/02 2:00:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=91>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/variaavande/images/tsianinasm.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fight fight fight</span><hr size=1> Varia skidded to a stop, turning her head and shielding her eyes. She turned Blade around and charged another direction, picking up Zelia and putting her on the back of the horse as she went by. Couldn't have Zelia staying there now could she? Hell no! (heh)<br>
<br>
~Ya! Ya!~ she kicked at her horse, and his hooves made dust he was galloping so fast, trampling several unconscious Romans as he stampeded toward the east exit. She could hear the rumbling of all the hooves behind her, and knew her athelfi were following her. A large wall was blocking the east exit, about three feet high, so she dug her heels in and pulled up, and that horse gave it all he had, and flew determinedly over the obstacle, landing with a thud on the other side of the wall. She reined him around and he pranced in place, waiting for the others.<br>

Once everyone was safely across (super horses, yeah yeah!), they wasted no time in hauling ass out of the area. <p><html> <font face="Signet Roundhand ATT" size="+1"> Varia Angelina Avande </font> </html></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=royalfogstone>Royal Fogstone</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#993300>(3/3/02 4:51:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=92>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fight fight fight</span><hr size=1> (((alright so are you out of the city of Rome?))) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ubailywesston.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Baily Wesston</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#993300>(3/3/02 6:47:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=93>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/variaavande/images/kylie4sm.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fight fight fight</span><hr size=1> (yes) <p><html> <font face="broadway" size="+1"> <center> Baily Wesston ~ Wrangler, rider, trainer </center> </font> </html></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=royalfogstone>Royal Fogstone</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#993300>(3/3/02 8:17:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=94>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fight fight fight</span><hr size=1> ***Fogstone soars out of the city after the amazons and fires another 3 white electricity fire balls at them and glances one off of Varia back knocking her off the horse as the rest of the engergy explodes in the air.*** <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uiizeliaii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>II Zelia II</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#993300>(3/4/02 12:50:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=95>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/iizeliaii/images/zel-1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fight fight fight</span><hr size=1> Since Zelia is sitting behind Varia on the horse,Fogstones little electrcity ball hits Zelia,not Varia,which is quite alright,since it was Varia she was taking the hit for,besides,Zel could take those kinds of hits without serious injurey.<br>

She didn't look quite like herself. Her skin was dark blue now and she was naked frost and snow swirled around her almost blurring her form completly. As she walk the ground beneath her froze. She moved between the horses not worrying that they would touch her. She smiled to var as they passed her they could feel the cold in the air. She began to chant in and old langauge. The sky darkned behind them around rome and fogstone. Dark clouds rolled in and thunder and lightning began to clash. The sky was filled with sleet and snow and rome wouldn't be digging out for days. Fogstone would noticbly be slowed down. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/unfoxton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NFoxton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>registered user</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#993300>(3/8/02 5:38:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=102>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> (This is fogstone)</span><hr size=1> ***Looks at Artemis.*** <br>

&quot;Looky here, little miss protector of the spoiled. How bout you back off, did you ever know that Rome was my home? Did you know that its a LITTLE rude to come waltzing in just for one prisoner, and killing some roman soilders? And did you know that Rome is the heart of the Roman empire? Well I don't just allow anyone to come in. I don't give one bit that your the amazons protectors, and I don't care for you atitude.  <br>
 <br>
And if you don't get off of Roman lands this instant, I will make sure that I will be a big part of the distruction of the amazon nation!!!&quot; <br>

***Fogstone then disappeared is a faint glow of white and silver.***<br>
