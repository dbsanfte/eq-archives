The bittersweet dark of night was once again surrounding her like a blanket, those silvery-golden eyes closed to make it complete. Her silence had been almost deafening of late. Few words had ventured from her lips towards anyone of late, whether in greeting or cursing. She seemed to be pulling back from those around her, though the cause could not be determined. Sartha was stubborn that way. It took much to learn the things that troubled the Amazon, and even that want to learn came with great patience and understanding of who she was and how she lived. It had been a long time since someone had bothered to attempt it, but perhaps that was part of the problem. Sartha was merely a closed book, sealed with a lock and only a handful of keys scattered about could unlock her:: <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#003366><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/usheyala.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sheyala</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 282<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(9/6/01 3:18:54 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://geocities.com/Tokyo/Pagoda/8446/mononoke_poster.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> A definition of silence...</span><hr size=1> ::Hoofclops are heard just behind Sartha--but they are more passing than greeting.
