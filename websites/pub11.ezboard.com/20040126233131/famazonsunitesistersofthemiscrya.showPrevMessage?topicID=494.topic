Sheyala had gone up and down the river as soon as the weather turned nice enough, selling her wares to lighten the load of her Chadesian weapons shop, and the surplus of material loaded into her hut in Themiscrya. She was getting too old for such clutter. With a weary chuckle, she forded Moondancer over the river one last time and rode home with a minnimum of her trade left. That was a heavy relief.<br>
<br>
Smiling she unsaddled and brushed off the tired mare and sent her off grazing where she was allowed. More tired than she had been in a very long time, Shey plopped down onto a small chair that sat under her favorite tree and leaned against it's stump. Mud and clay from the rivers streaked her forehead, and water droplets still fell from her leathers, but still she was home again. Proceeding to unload more weight from her weary body, she set the saddlebags she had been carrying onto the ground and opened them to see what she had left. Three swords, two pairs of sais, two carved staves and a chakrum. She was satisfied with her saled and huffed a sigh of relief. It was time to get back to living with her sisters, and the thought of being home with her 'family' again was a happy event that made her want to cry with joy. However, the dirt streaking her face would prevent any such action less it stick further.<br>
<br>
&quot;Clearence sale... Anyone?&quot; She whispered to herself as she laughed.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dawnithinia>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 455<br> <font color=#993300>(5/14/03 8:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=479.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: No rest for the weary</span><hr size=1>  Dawn was a legend, her name brought about the stirrings of stories and memories that not many Amazons shared-of course, that was because Dawnithinia Rivent Darkshade had been much of a misunderstanding to those who never took the chance to understand. It wasn't much of a secret that the Dawn of old days had replaced the one most amazons new, and that Dawn; was back in town.<br>
<br>
 It wasn't much of a change, more than Dawn had returned to her days of being a rogue assassin. In truth, it was probably better for Dawn, easier for all involved. In that sense of being a rogue, Dawn had taken a few days from XVH, and had taken her time travelling back through Amazon lands-finding old sisters whom she thought might have missed her. Along this trail, on the grand afternoon that it was..stallion and assassin stumbled upon Shey.<br>
<br>
 From behind the tree, Dawn dismounted her horse, and like Shey allowed it to graze. Silently, the assassin walked around the tree, resting hand around the hilt of her sword, and the other behind her back. A genuine smile played upon her lips, and those trademark emerald pools glanced downward upon Shey through trendrils of blood.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I don't suppose you're willing to sell an assassin a new dagger.. or two.&quot;<br>
<br>
 The smile turned to a grin, as Dawn waited for Shey to reply. It wouldn't take the amazon long to recognize Dawn; she hadn't changed much, she was still strong, dressed in black, and carried weaponary to state her strength. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sheyala>Sheyala</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 470<br> <font color=#993300>(5/15/03 7:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=479.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> DAWN!!!!!!!!</span><hr size=1> Shey had heard the rustling of the grass, and with a questioning gaze she turned at a familiar voice. What she saw shocked her. It was Dawn.. but it couldn't be.. could it? Without a care her gaze turned into a warm smile, her lips quirking at the sight of such an old friend. She didn't have many of those left.... And without any warning or thoughts of repercussions she threw her arms around the old assassin, hugging her tightly almost as if she was making sure this person wasn't a mirage.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dawn! Could it really be you.... I had thought you...&quot; Thought her what? dead but of course she couldn't bring herself to say it. That word brought a lot of hard times upon her. Too many to count.... &quot;where how when..&quot; She stopped suddenly and laughed at herself. &quot;Of course Sheyala has weapons. Whenever in history has she not?&quot; <br>
<br>
Another voice joined the group. It sounded old and tired, but as blunt and momotonous as always. The great white wolf Anya appeared in Shey's doorway, sitting on her graying haunces. Her silver coat wasn't what it used to be... But her spirit was always young. &gt;&gt;Welcome back assassin.. You smell....as always.&lt;&lt; Another laugh from Shey, another hug. Hopefully it wasn't possible for dawn to suffocate. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dawnithinia>Dawnithinia </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silver Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 457<br> <font color=#993300>(5/18/03 11:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=479.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DAWN!!!!!!!!</span><hr size=1>  Dawn, for a moment, hesitated in reaction to Shey's hug, but eventually fell into a response with another hug. It felt good to be around her true athelfi, around those whom had known her, and those whom had missed her.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I had.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Was Dawn's only simple response. There wasn't much more to give, she had been dead, she had been gone, and now she had returned. Of course, with all good returns, was a story.. for another time.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I'm back now. For awhile.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn smiled, giving some sort of support before looking to Anya. The wolf companion had been no surprise, Dawn had sensed her from the beginning..and probably found Shey because of the animal.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Thank you Anya, it feels good to be home.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/bamazonsunite.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sheyala>Sheyala</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Golden Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 471<br> <font color=#993300>(5/19/03 8:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=479.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ^^;</span><hr size=1> Shey smirked as Dawn was taken aback, but had no smart replies to it for now.

 Dawn nodded. It was good to feel comfortable around Shey, to feel at home. But it'd been so long that Dawn doubted how anything felt at this point. <br>

 Slowly the assassin settled down upon the ground, her back to the tree.<br>

There were many reasons, some she didn't want to admit and some she wasn't really sure of. Silently she looked from her feet to Anya and back to Dawn.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, there are many reasons I suppose. I have been traveling for a year and a half, and almost didn't make it back. But during my trip I discovered that I am getting to old for that sort of thing Dawn, and Anya isn't getting any younger either. So I returned to settle here for a time to rest up and regain what has been lost or forgotten when I was gone.&quot;<br>
<br>
Anya chuckled to herself. &gt;&gt;You make it sound as if we are falling apart and wasting away. You are not that old...&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Shey chuckled. &quot;No, but you are&quot;<br>
<br>
She refused to mention that she and Anya had been lonely, for they had been alone far before they came to Themiscrya, but ever since finding, and losing friends here, they felt the need to be around anything familiar. <br>
<br>
&quot;So here I am. And what about you?&quot; She raised a brow with a smirk, that old glimmer back in her eyes. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

<br>
 Why had she come back to the amazon lands?<br>
<br>
 For a few moments Dawn remained silent, rolling the hilt of a dagger between her two hands as she pondered the answers that were more appropriate to give to Shey, and then the answers that her athelfi was more likely to go hunting for-knowing they existed. Then Dawn looked up at Shey, taking a deep breath she prepared her answer and then spoke.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I came back because of my athelfi. I'm not much of an amazon sister anymore, nor do I request that I become like I was. I'm quite happy with the reputation that the Amazon Nation has for me, and carries with it in its stories. But I came back for my athelfi. I came back to check on my daughter whose taken over Orio-Pata, to check on my students who've created their own tribe with a power triad of Queen's.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn gave a bit of a shrug. So it wasn't the answer she knew Shey would be looking for.. but it was an answer none the less.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I just came back. Not quite sure why. Just back.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn glanced to Anya and then Shey, laughing lightly.<br>
<br>

She guessed, no expected it. And she knew it wasn't the whole truth. She hadn't lied, but she hadn't said everything. Shey left it at that, because neither did she. She hadn't expanded on where she had been or why, she hadn't touched on why she had come back to this place that held so many fresh wounds. Sartha was one of the largest, but that was somewhere neither of them dared to go. Then, she began to laugh.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And you two are not old.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Massaging her wrists she smirked with the irony of it. &quot;My mind says that still, but my body disagrees with me Dawn. You see, we have lose our immortality friend, and time is catching up with us since we have cheated it so badly. Joints ache in rain, cold in the morning encourages one not to get up. Some days Anya can barely keep up with me and the horse. Not that I was ever able to keep up with a horse mind you...&quot; She smiled, knowledge in her century old eyes that Dawn shared too.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not ancient perhaps, not old, but perhaps older.&quot; She raked a hand through her hair, and if one looked close enough silver threatened the roots in her part. However, she was ever still the warrior, now commanding the Black Mare. &quot;Something no normal person would complain of I suppose, but when one has lived so long and never aged it is a strange thing. So, what made you come and visit...&quot; She paused a moment abnd continued choosing her words to be humerous as she waivered her voice like an old woman. &quot;This old maid and her geriatric wolf?&quot; In jest Anya rolled over barring her stomach acting as if she couldn't get up. Shey chuckled and smiled in her bemused way. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
