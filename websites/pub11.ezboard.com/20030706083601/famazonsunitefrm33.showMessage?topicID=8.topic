For being a great lover of the groans of dying men, she fills their hearts with hatred, so that they may slay each other. <br>
<br>
Famous trouble caused by Eris. <br>
 Being of such a deplorable nature, the gods have kept Eris apart and, as it is widely known, she was not in the list of guests who were invited to the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, the parents of Achilles. Nevertheless Eris, being difficult to get rid of, came to the party and threw a golden apple through the door with the inscription:<br>
<br>
&quot;For the fairest&quot;<br>
<br>
And Hera, Athena and Aphrodite started disputing on account of the apple and were therefore sent by Zeus to Mount Ida near Troy in order to be judged by the shepherd Paris, who chose Aphrodite as the most beautiful, accepting Helen's hand for a bribe. <br>
 <br>
<br>
Loved by no one, and yet possesses many. <br>
 The cruel works of Eris, who fosters battles and wars, awake the minds and hearts of mortals and set them in motion to exchange death for death, as did the Pelopides Atreus and Thyestes 1 or the sons of Oedipus, in spite of the fact that no one loves her, which is shown in the fact that artists represented her as a most repulsive woman. Some believe that this is so because mortals must pay Eris her due following the will of the gods; yet others have said that discord among mortals displeases Zeus. In any case, despite the fact that nobody loves her, many are possessed by her. <br>
 <br>
Little at the beginning, becomes soon a giant. <br>
 When Eris causes a dispute she has at the beginning an insignificant appearance, but, as they say, she soon reaches heaven with her head while having her feet still on the ground. And there is no disagreement between the contenders concerning Discord itself, for they usually agree in carrying the quarrel as far as they deem it necessary and desirable, which normally is, as some put it, &quot;to the bitter end&quot;, since those possessed by contention never stop agreeing in the necessity of letting division prevail. That is why there is no end to quarrels until some other force takes Eris' place, for nothing can be expected from this cruel divider to end a strife:<br>
<br>
&quot;Discord is the last of the gods to close an argument.&quot; [Antigone 2 to a Herald. Aeschylus, Seven Against Thebes 1057]<br>
<br>
But when Eris leaves, the state of harmony that was previously enjoyed returns, for harmony has no part in discord. <br>
 <br>
But some think that Eris cannot be avoided, arguing that equality and fairness have no existence beyond the name, and that is why they do not hesitate, when they deem it necessary in order to achieve the attractive aims that Eris whispers in their ears, to plunge family, friends and country into darkness in order to win, through debauched contention, whatever they fancy is of unsurpassable value, be it gold, power, Fame or whatever these three may provide. <br>
<br>
<br>
Eris do not say to mortals &quot;look at my face, be nasty against your neighbours&quot;, but instead stirs up everybody to win pre-eminence, letting them be persuaded of their own superiority, or be convinced that their rights should come first. That is why they say:<br>
<br>
&quot;Truly Eris is a goddess to fear.&quot; [Euripides, Phoenician Women, 799]<br>
<br>
since it is clear that there are no troubles that this hard-hearted goddess cannot devise. <br>
<br>
Seeing that Eris is often present in the life of mortals, some have said that there are two of them, distinguishing two kinds of strife. One of them, they say, is she who causes war and battles, and the other is she who makes a man grow eager to work by showing him the prosperity of his neighbours. This Eris, they add, is wholesome for men, since she, creating enmity between craftsman and craftsman, and causing beggar to be jealous of beggar, and minstrel of minstrel, makes them all hurry after wealth. <br>
For these reasons, they say, this Eris may be worthy of praise, whereas the Eris who delights in mischief should be avoided. For the latter holds men back from the work that will make their fortune and right, keeping them close to troubles and wangles and court-houses and the like. And considering these realities the poet Hesiod established this rule:<br>
<br>
&quot;He has no time for courts and public life<br>
Who has not stored up one full year's supply.&quot;<br>

But the woman [Pandora] took off the great lid of the jar with her hands and scattered all these [the harmful daimones offspring of Eris] and her thought caused sorrow and mischief to men. Only Elpis (Hope) remained there in an unbreakable home within under the rim of the great jar, and did not fly out at the door; for ere that, the lid of the jar stopped her, by the will of Aegis-holding Zeus who gathers the clouds. But the rest, countless plagues, wander amongst men; for earth is full of evils and the sea is full. Of themselves diseases come upon men continually by day and by night, bringing mischief to mortals silently; for wise Zeus took away speech from them. So is there no way to escape the will of Zeus.&quot; -Works &amp; Days 54-105<br>
<br>
&quot;Ares drove these [the Trojans] on, and the Akhaians grey-eyed Athene, and Phobos (Terror) drove them, and Deimos (Fear), and Eris (Hate) whose wrath is relentless, she is the sister and companion of murderous Ares, she who is only a little thing at the first, but thereafter grows until she strides on the earth with her head striking heaven. She then hurled down bitterness equally between both sides as she walked through the onslaught making men's pain heavier.&quot; -Iliad 4.441<br>
<br>
&quot;Their fighting work ... man-slaughtering Ares, and Eris, whose wrath is relentless [woke].&quot; -Iliad 5.518<br>
<br>
&quot;But after the Olympians merged in the men's company [on the battlefield] strong Eris, defender of peoples, burst out.&quot; -Iliad 20.48<br>
<br>
Eris is insatiable in her desire for bloodshed, and after all the other gods have withdrawn from the battlefield, she still remains rejoicing over the havoc that has been made.<br>
<br>
&quot;Zeus sent down in speed to the fast ships of the Akhaians the wearisome goddess Eris, holding in her hands the portent of battle. She took her place on the huge-hollowed black ship of Odysseus which lay in the middle, so that she could cry out to both flanks ... There the goddess took her place, and cried out a great cry and terrible and loud, and put strength in all the Akhaians hearts, to go on tirelessly with their fighting of battles.&quot; -Iliad 11.3<br>
<br>
&quot;The pressure held their heads on a line, and they whirled and fought like wolves, and Eris, the Lady of Sorrow, was gladdened to watch them. She alone of all the immortals attended this action.&quot; -Iliad 11.73<br>
<br>
&quot;[The] goddesses, who range in order the ranks of men in fighting, [are] Athene and Eris, sacker of cities.&quot; -Iliad 5.333<br>
<br>
&quot;And with him followed the Trojan battalions in their strength; and Ares led them with the goddess Eris, she carrying with her the turmoil of shameless hatred.&quot; -Iliad 5.590<br>
<br>
&quot;Dread Eris, marshalling the slaughter of fighting men, cruel spirit, who took the senses and perception out of those fighters who tried to fight in the face of Zeus' son, the War God, and the souls of these went under the ground, to the house of Hades.&quot; -Shield of Herakles 148<br>
