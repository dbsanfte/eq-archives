 Slipping down out of the saddle of her horse, she gently pushed it off down the opposite direction of the way she and Sartha were traveling. It was only an hour or so from the camp site. . <br>

<br>
 The assassin slipped silently into the camp, and unnoticed. Once she found the main tent, of Toman she stepped inside. Yes, this caused the warlord to glance over to her. Thank the gods he wasn't entertaining someone.<br>
<br>
 Dawn's emeralds glanced over Toman, as she smiled, saying nothing, as he grunted softly and began to speak.<br>
<br>
 &quot;What do you want, and who let you into my camp?&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn shrugged lightly, as she stepped closer. The stupid warlord's sword was three feet from his side, and would be very useless.<br>
<br>
 &quot;No one let me in, and I want you dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Dawn growled, launching over the table between them, and slamming a dagger hilt into the warlords skull. Instantly the leader yelled, for his guards. Dawn had to act fast.<br>
<br>
 Dawn glared at the man before her, as another dagger joined her hands, and without hesitating the two blades slammed into Toman's shoulders, slicing through the bone. <br>
<br>
 Toman screamed in pain, as Dawn twisted the blades around, and then as she pulled them out, she sliced his throat. The daggers were tossed to the ground, in the blood, on the blade, Dawn's name was inscribed. . as well as her position. <br>
<br>
 And as the guards ran into the tent, she ran out the other side, and into the woods, to find Sartha... still soaked in the males blood.<br>

<br>
 &quot;If I don't want the army, then leading it would be taking it? Why take it if you don't want it?&quot;<br>

 Dawn raised a brow, as she glanced upward at Ares. She could play this game too. <p>

The army could do what they wanted, she was done with them. Her point had been proven. <br>
<br>
 Slipping into the woods, Dawn looked behind her to see how far Sartha was. Probably not to far, Dawn thought. After all, Sartha and her were athelfi, and would be with eachother forever. Even in death. <p>

::Though Sartha was destined to follow Dawn like a shadow, she still did not follow quite the same path Dawn did, never allowing herself to worship or become an accomplice with a god, only friends and aquaintances at the most.
