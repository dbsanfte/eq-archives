<br>
As she stood at Alysias hut,she hesitated for a few moments,wandering if this was really a good idea.<br>
<br>
Giving a light sigh,she knocked on Alysias door,then crossed her arms,waiting for an answer. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualysiaofscynthia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alysia of Scynthia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 377<br> <font color=#993300>(8/1/02 1:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=377.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Inside the Hut</span><hr size=1> As she knocked on the door, it opened before her eyes. Inside she could see Alysia-Samsara sitting at a desk going over certain scrolls, and as the door came to a stop, so did her upraised hand. She never took her eyes off the scroll, nor did she say a word as the door opened. It was obvious she had been using immortal powers to open the door . . . perhaps something Zelia did not know about her new &quot;Trainer&quot;. She was of some serious immortal blood. <br>
<br>
As soon as Zelia would make a step inside, two large wolves came towards her with bared teeth and extended claws. Their size was greater than that of any regular wolf. For their height rose up to her hips, and their paws were the size of a human head. Both had bright blue eyes with a tint of yellow, and each wore a golden medallion around their neck. It was ancient symbols and writings. They growled lowly as the hair on their backs rose upwards. <br>
Alysia then turned her eyes towards the beasts and spoke in an ancient tongue that few amazons understood. As far as she knew, only herself, Yakut, Genesis, and Dawn spoke the language. (Other than her children Belle and Wulf of course, but even they needed the medallions to help translate.) <br>
Instantly the wolves backed down from their stance.<br>
<br>
Alysia smirked lightly as she patted one of them on the head when he came to her, and the other lay at her feet.<br>
<br>
&quot;You'll have to forgive Aeceus and Scythe. Their a bit protective when it comes to their Queen.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uiizeliaii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>II Zelia II</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 116<br> <font color=#993300>(8/2/02 1:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=377.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:</span><hr size=1> As the door opened,Zelia took that as a welcome,and took a step inside the hut. She stopped immediatly as the two wolves approached her.<br>
<br>
She eyed the wolves with caution. Slightly intimidated but not fearful. She'd seen big beasts before,and normally prefured to keep her distance,even when it came to Varia's pet,but in this case she didn't have much of a choice.<br>
<br>
Looking now at Alysia. She nods a little.<br>
<br>
&quot;They're only doing what comes natural I suppose.&quot; <br>
<br>
She offers a kind smile then extends a hand to Alysia.<br>
<br>
&quot;I would like to thank you for the help youre going to be offering me. I appreciate it,ya know.&quot;<br>
<br>
It wasn't like Zel to be as kind as she had been lately,but changes had occured in her,which made it more possible to even socialize with people without having a hidden agenda. Even with gods or immortals alike,she'd shown great self control..for her anyways.<br>

<br>
&quot;Don't ever thank me for doing this. I am doing this for the Nation, and for Queen DeL.&quot; She paused.<br>
<br>
&quot;You'll earn my trust and respect Zelia. As of right now, you are considerable to me as an enemy would be, or possibly prey.&quot;<br>
<br>
She stood and walked over grabbing a small water skin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now let's go.&quot;<br>
<br>
She walked out of the hut followed by the two wolves and Zelia, as she headed towards the exiting gates of Themiscrya towards the forests. A few amazons roaming the village turned their eyes from the Amazons, knowing verywell of Zelia's crimes and punishments. The guards at the gates opened them up allowing safe passage for the two as well as the wovles.<br>
<br>
Alysia then looked to a pathway marking one side, and then took the area leading to the forests that held no pathway, just trees and brush about the lands.<br>
<br>
&quot;You think you're a destroyer hmm . . .?

<br>
&quot;Well then.&quot;<br>
<br>
She followed Alysia out to the grounds. And by now lost complete interest in the hounds that had followed.<br>
<br>
She took a look around the area before returning her attention to Alysia. <br>
<br>
&quot;If i'm not a destroyer,then someone has explaining to do.&quot; Scratches her right forearm,then crosses her arms over her chest.<br>
<br>
Zelia was now considering not being as polite as she had been lately,but then maybe,that wasnt really Zelia doing the concidering.<br>
<br>
Realizes she's stareing strongly at Alysia. Shakes her head,and directs her eyes to the wolves. &quot;Hmm...&quot;<br>
<br>
Looks back at Alysia. &quot;So,whats first,hm?&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;First you need to learn patience.&quot;<br>
<br>
She leaned down drawing daggers from her boots and tossing them to Zelia. She then drew her own daggers from her sides.<br>
<br>
&quot;I need to see your strengths Zelia. How you kill, attack, fight. For us to find your strengths in destroying, will help us find the weaknesses in conquering it.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smirked lightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now attack me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Alysia was feared by most of her enemies. Saurians were easy, Centaurs were fun to fight, and Romans were great to play with. All had one thing in common. They knew she feared nothing.<br>
And they were right. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uiizeliaii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>II Zelia II</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 119<br> <font color=#993300>(8/9/02 3:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=377.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Lesson one....daggers...?</span><hr size=1> &quot;Patience...&quot; She mumbled,then drew herself back. Taking two steps back as the daggers were tossed to her. She eyed the daggers as they landed at her feet.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know how to use those weapons,I was never taught.&quot;<br>
<br>
She held her arms at her sides,wrists out. Then in an instant a very sharp impaler which appeared to be of bone material retracted out of her flesh on each of her (outer) wrists. Both impalers were the length of her forearms,and then three inches longer than that. <br>
<br>
&quot;I am equiped with my own weapons.&quot;<br>
<br>
She lunged foreward at Alysia,but stopped abruptly just a foot or so away from Alysia. Her right arm was positioned infront of her,and was held just above her chest,while her left arm was positioned and held just at her waist. Wrists out,impalers horizontal to her body,in a defensive stance.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't want to attack you.&quot; Actually,she did,but then she didn't. heh.<br>
<br>
She kept her eyes on Alysia,un-blinking. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualysiaofscynthia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alysia of Scynthia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 381<br> <font color=#993300>(8/10/02 3:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=377.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Attacks</span><hr size=1> Alysia grinned deviously almost. <br>

<br>
She had in the past a few times, but those were under &quot;special&quot; circumstances that were well known.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have very interesting weapons might I add. I see you bottle inside yourself some secrets. I have a few of my own.&quot;<br>

&quot;My weapons are far from being a secret.&quot; She managed to get that sentence out just before her legs were swept out from under her,and she landed with a thud on the ground.<br>
<br>
A second didnt go by,and Zelia rolled backwards,then stood back up on her feet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Youre pretty fast.&quot; She grinned.<br>
<br>
She could feel her adrenolin(sp) pumping. <br>
She balled her hands into fists,and gave a moments thought to the situation,which resulted in her retracting the impalers back into her flesh. She didnt want to loose her cool and  end up causeing damange,minimal or not.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope you don't mind,I'd much rather prefer not using weapons.&quot; <br>

With that said and done,she shot toward Alysia with great speed. Only to ram her like a goat.<br>

Zelia had a major problem with having any weapon placed near her neck,and without a moments thought,she threw her hand up,and swung it over,gripping the sharp blade of the sword,and jerking it to the side.<br>
<br>
She then kicked her left leg straight up,and sent a kick with the toe of her boot right under Alysias chin just before releasing the blade of the sword. She then rolled to the side,and immediatly jumped to her feet,arms up ready for defence. Her hands were once again balled up into tight fists;blood was dripping from the hand which she had gripped the sword with.<br>
<br>
Her hand was stinging slightly,but she ignored it,and knew it wouldnt heal for a while,since her lack of the nutrition she needed was not there,but that didn't bother her much. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uiizeliaii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>II Zelia II</A> at: 8/14/02 2:06:55 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualysiaofscynthia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alysia of Scynthia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 384<br> <font color=#993300>(8/14/02 2:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=377.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Defeated?

But she had done exactly what Aly had wanted her to. <br>
She finally quit her laughing and then she glanced up at the bleeding Zelia. She kept a slight chuckle and reached in her pouch taking hold of a small vile. She tossed the small black vile to Zelia.<br>
<br>
&quot;Put this on the cut. It's Wolves Blood. A herbal ointment that I created myself. It kills the strongest of pains and closes wounds quickly.&quot;<br>
<br>
(An ancient form of Morphine or Novacaine)<br>
<br>
She then flipped up and took the sword placing it back in the hideaway of a small tree where it had previously been hidden. Alysia hardly carried weapons. But they were hidden in the forests where the amazons knew of.<br>

She stuffed the small black vile down her top,not interested in using any medicine,but perhaps she'll give it to Varia who might have a use for it.<br>

She turned her back on Alyisa,tore a strip of cloth from her shirt,then wrapped it around her bleeding hand. Normally she wouldnt turn her back on anyone,but she didnt think of Alysia as an enemy or a threat of that nature.<br>

<br>
&quot;They are our enemies. I would understand your reply if you were against bloodshed, but you've proven that wrong in many cases.&quot;<br>
<br>
She turned back to the Centaurs and narrowed her eyes as they looked over a map of nearby amazon lands. By the Ancients, they still held that grudge about the stupid lands!<br>
<br>
&quot;Hardly a threat? To you or I, yes . .  but imagine that back in the village while all the other amazons sleep, these Centaurs sneek by and just happen to attack. What if they kill one of our sisters?&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;If it's one thing I know,the tribes have been well protected lately,but if it pleases the nation...&quot;<br>
<br>
She stood up from her crouching position from behind the bushes,then rushes toward the centaurs. As she was running toward the enemy,those impalers returned at her wrists.<br>
<br>
As she came upon the first centaur,she lept over his back,and as she did so,her right impaler was drawn across his throat,slitting it wide open. She landed on her feet with a soft thud on the other side of the centaur as he fell dead.<br>
<br>
She looks at the 3 remaining centaurs,who seemed a bit surprised,but pulled thier weapons none the less.<br>
<br>
She looks at each of the centaurs,a dark smirk playing on her lips. &quot;I havnt eaten in weeks. I bet your human halves would make a scrumptious appitizer.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her smirk turned into a grin as 2 of the 3 centaurs now charged her,one on either side of her. Once they were close enough she lept straight up into the air,pulled off a tight front flip gaining some force,she then straightened mid air,feet coming down hard on the back of one centaur who was on the left. A slight 'Cracking' was heared when her feet made contact on the centaurs back. To her amazement,the force didnt break the back like she had hoped,just cracked it. The centaur she had landed on,immediatly bucked,and sent Zel falling to the ground and landing on her bum.<br>
<br>
Zelia rolled directly under the centaur now before he could start stomping. Quickly she swings both impalers up and across in an 'X' motion,slicing the centaurs belly open. She then quickly rolls out from under him before getting more than a splatter of blood on her,and before the centaur could fall on her.<br>
<br>
She looked up just in time to see the 3rd centaur right infront of her. The centaur starts trying to stomp on her with his hooves. She manages to roll from side to side,avading the first few blows,but not quite quick enough,and a pair of hooves comes crashing down toward her. &quot;Argh!&quot; She groans and brings her hands up,catching the hooves in her hands,and using that goddly strength of hers to keep the sharp hooves from coming down on her. She keeps a firm grip on the hooves as the centaur now tries to escape her clutches,but he fails of course,as Zel suddenly pulls then pushes up on the hooves,causeing the centaurs legs to separate,then the leg bones breaking.<br>
<br>
As the centaur screamed in pain,Zelia struggles to push the centaur back by his broken limbs,then releases him,giving her enough time to roll out of the way from the falling centaur.<br>
<br>
She jumps to her feet immediatly,a little out of breath,and looking from the cripled centaur to the 4th and last centaur. &quot;Bring it!&quot; She raises her voice some at the 4th centaur,who suddenly takes off running (hehe).<br>
<br>
Once making sure the 4th centaur was gone,she looks at the crippled centaur who was struggling,trying to get up,but failing miserably.<br>
<br>
&quot;You can forget the plans you and your commrads might have had.&quot; She stated simply,then began to walk back toward Alysia. As she was passing the crippled centaur,she swung her impaler,slicing the centaurs head clean off his shoulders.<br>
<br>
She stops just where Alysia is. <br>
<br>
&quot;Happy now?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/ualysiaofscynthia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alysia of Scynthia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 390<br> <font color=#993300>(8/20/02 7:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitesistersofthemiscrya.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=377.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Test</span><hr size=1> Alysia grinned as she watched everything play out before her. It was so real. She crossed her arms and then looked as Zelia approached her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very impressive. You passed.&quot;<br>
<br>
She lifted her hand upwards and then brought it down. Each of the dead wounded Centaurs that lay there, quickly morphed into large white wolves. They all stood up and as their blue eyes began to glow, the blood dripped off of them and they nodded a bow to both amazons and darted back into the woods.<br>
<br>
Alysis turned to Zelia.<br>
<br>
&quot;You took something from the Nation, and for the Nation you attempted to give it back. This was a test. No one was killed. But I needed to see if you were willing to submit to the duties that protecting our fellow sisters comes with.&quot;<br>
<br>
She sighed lightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;If something like this had really happened, I would have jumped in myself along with you. One rule of the heart of us sisters, is we never leave eachother alone in a fight unless asked to.&quot;<br>
