When River began to wipe her tears from her cheeks, she lifted her head back up.<br>

With a last little sniffle, she spoke in the same tone her sister did, &quot;Can you carry me up there, sister?&quot;  Zoe's attention was then turned to Alysia-Samsara as she talked to her.

She took a moment to adjust to the weight before stepping forward.  <br>
<br>
Gabrielle's legacy was clear in her poise even in this horrible moment, and the eloquence of her words.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Queen Gabrielle took me in, trusting so much more in my potential than I could dream.  I was a common village girl, unaware of my heritage and content to spend the rest of my life making carvings, but she showed me the way I was to follow.  The Amazon way.  I have the responsibility and the honor of living up to that, which I will thank her for in my thoughts every single day.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Her voice was cracking by the end, and she quickly turned to the body on the pyre before her emotions became overwhelming.  <br>

The fact that she was just a bard from Poteidaia, turning to being a life-long friend to Xena, Princess and then Queen, and then becoming Queen again. She kind of reminded her a little bit of her brother, seeing as Julian was or still partially is a bard.<br>

She had not known either of them...but it was obvious the children were Gabrielle's.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Hera....be the motherless,&quot; Hippolyte whispered.  As she said that she thought of her own son, Theseus.  He was now living with Gabby's family.  Learning the ways of the world ruled by men.  He had grown up much, since he had moved to Poteidaia.  Hippolyte was proud.  He at least treated the women of the town with great respect.  And was in the process of becoming a great warrior.  <br>
<br>
Hipp's eyes turned to the pyre.  She wondered what had brought death to the beautiful bardic queen.  <br>
<br>
As her eyes continued to dance around the amazons who stood watching their parting sister.  Hippolyte saw Solari and DeLerium.  She smiled proudly at DeLerium....she even looked the magnificant Vasilissa of Themiscrya.  Her eyes glancing to Solari...she saw that she too, wore the belt signifying one as a Vasilissa.  One brow titled curiously, as she looked at the belts markings.  The markings looked to signify war.  Her face quickly frowned.  Was the Amazon Nation at war?  Is that why her father Ares sent her back home? <p>@xxx}}::::::::::::::::::::>
