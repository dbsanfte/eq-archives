 <br>
And right behind Fogstone were 25 black warriors with very long swords like his, black armor with a black cape, and wooden masks. And they all had black horse. <br>
 <br>
Fogstone then gave the motion to charge into the little valley which the village was in. The miniature army came roaring down the hill and charged into the village drawing out there swords and quickly slaughtered the amazons that saw them coming. One of the black warriors took out a dagger and rammed it into an amazons head and carrier her and stuck her with the dagger still in her to a pole in the village square. Another lopped off an amazons head.  <br>
 <br>
The mini army was already half way through the village and blood already was covering most of the village. Some of the warriors had just jumped off there horses to give themselves a better challenge...  <br>
 <br>
After the carnage was was over the warriors set fire to the village, and then salted the land so that no one would be able to work the land.   <br>
 <br>
The army then left with Fogstone...*** <br>

Was it coincidence, it could of been from the warm air suddenly hitting the cold ground, or was it juat typical of her presence..one might never know...she, she didnt care...She walked through the trees of the village, she transfixed the guards so they didnt even know she was there, nd walked right past them. A slight jingling was heard from the silver anklbells that jingeled as she walked. Her black long skirts swishing by her feet. Her crimson poet shirt stood starch against her pale skin and black raven hair,that was braided on both sides and hanging over her shoulders. She looked around with a smile on her black lips. Greece was not to far from her homeland and the surrounding areas that she frequented do to the promise she had made the Turks fo destroying the only family she ever knew. A smirk then played on her lips as she remembered the screams as she took that lifegiving blood from the newborns of the families...her cargo was being shipped as she walked to her new home. She stopped as she came upon the end of the path, her light grey eyes, that at times, almost looked white, scanned the area for Queen Varia, picking up her scent, she headed in the direction of the Queen of Chadesia.*~  <p>Mistress Moranna Dracul

Typical of a lowly cur to attack someone who is mindful of the ways of nature.If only Nadia and myself had arrived in Chadesia earlier,you would NOT have enjoyed such good fortune for Andraste`s Raven would now be feasting upon your worthless souls.Even now,i would enjoy cleaving open your empty skull but it is Queen Varia`s wish that i do not and i bow before her request.If however,our paths should ever cross outside Chadesia,be assured that my Raven Axe and Nadia`s sword will feast upon you and your devil spawn......Kally of Siluria. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table>
