Having just passed through the lands upon this very same road, she had not wanted to attempt her goals then. Her victory in the lands of Themiscrya were too close and with so many lands to choose from there had been no need for risk. But now...now she was ready. She stood upon a forked road leading in three direcitons, from Themiscrya to the Northern lands and Orio-Pata.<br>
<br>
Hope rested against a large flat rock which divided the road into three directions. Her thoughts were divided as well. So many days from her inherited lands of the Diaprassea vineyards. Time spent from her reawakening memories of so long ago, time which might be spent securing a temple with followers. Time from Ares and from her mother. But she would have her say in Amazon issues of importance. She was determined in that. This plan of hers would work. It was just a matter of planning and patience.<br>
<br>
This was the rumored location of the Orio-Pata Queen's downfall. Hope did not know the specifics of her life's end but Hope knew that Dawnithinia Rivent Darkshade was a powerful well respected leader. She did not know of the current leader. Her paid informants had not yet reached her with such information. Perhaps she would disipline them in her own preferred way. Just as well as she had no eventual intention of paying them for their services. <br>
<br>
As she stood there against the rock, Hope looked down to notice the faintest of reflections under the grass at the base of the rock. She curiously looked down and reached to the grass. Her own goddess powers must have alerted her to an uncertain mystical influence there. Almost as if the Orio-Pata Queen had left a presence behind. There was the unmistakable presence of a runic mark to this location. An Amazon had died here afterall, and this stone.. it was essentially a marking.<br>
<br>
Had the Amazon Queen Dawnithinia Rivent Darkshade owned any kind of rune weaponry, jewelry or other possessions? If so... and if she had them with her at the time of her death... here... then this entire rock could be considered as a burial marker. The very item Hope was searching for.<br>
<br>
A light uncommon smile played across Hope's face as she realized further trips into the Orio-Pata lands were unnecessary. She stood up and walked away from the great stone. With some concentration, a small section of the stone broke off. Hope used her powers to further break the small piece into an even smaller more easily managable size. She pocketed the stone piece and took one last look around the area before travelling to her next destination. The Amazon lands of Chadesia.....<br>
