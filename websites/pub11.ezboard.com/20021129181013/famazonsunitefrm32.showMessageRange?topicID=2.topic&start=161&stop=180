Then there was Aphrodite's gift.  The goddess of love had surely delved deep into Paris's heart.  For there was one thing he wanted above all.  And his lust was stronger then his wisdom.  Helen, a daughter of Zeus, and the most lovely of all mortals was a great prize.  True, she was married.   But, with Aphrodite's promise, he could still have her.<br>

Not only the union of Peleus and Thetis, but of the victory of one of your fellow goddesses! You should be ashamed of yourself, acting like such a child! Now bite your tongue, and congratulate Aphrodite like a gracious loser. Your lose is far from the fault of Paris. So Hera, do calm down and enjoy the rest of the wedding. Do not make it a miserable time for the rest of us, because you don't know how to back down gracefully.&quot; Apollo's face looked hurt, how had Hera taken out her anger on Paris, a mortal who had known no better of his choices. He had not cared what type of punishment Hera would try and cast upon him. He would not allow her to victimize Paris, or ruin the party for anyone else.<br>
<br>
He walked to young Paris and smiled down at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do not take Hera's words to heart, young Paris. She speaks out of rage.&quot; Apollo looked coldly back at Hera.<br>
<br>
&quot;And do not fright. She will bring  you no misfortune, for I will not allow it. As will not the other gods upon Olympus. We watch over you always, and shall not let Hera release her dreadful rage upon you. For you have done nothing on this day but make a decision that you thought was right. For Hera does not understand, that perhaps it was another who judged, maybe she would have won. But it is not another, tis you Paris who chose on this day. And tis you who will receive the rewards and the repercussions of your choice.&quot; Apollo smiled to him, turning around and raising his hands in celebration. <br>

<br>
&quot;I've got it!&quot; Apollo smiled, shaking the hair from his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;We'll appear to Helen in a dream. Ofcourse a very divine dream, but a dream nonetheless, we will talk to Helen. Tell her that Meneleus isn't treating her fairly, yadda yadda. We'll flash some vision of Paris, and alpha omega! We're done! But alas, then we have to actually get Helen to Paris. But that won't be that hard.&quot; Apollo's look was questioning as he  eyed Aphrodite.<br>

He had been here all along, after all he was not going to miss this wedding.  Particularly of the woman who helped raise him after his 'rejection' from Olympus.  He had decided to remain silent throughout this 'competition'.  He knew better than to choose sides.  Even though he had made his peace with his mother, he was not going to say anything against her, he knew better than to choose sides, even though his own wife was in the competition as well.  Last time earned him a lame leg.<br>
<br>
He stood up slowly, his hair was actually nicely washed and his beard was too.  This was not the normal image people were used to of him, usually being hard and work and covered with soot from working in the forge.  He was freshly cleaned and bathed and was wearing a nice clean red tunic, with black lining.  His eyes followed Apollo who seemed to be all over the place.  He merely shook his head and THOUGHT to himself, <br>
<br>
~See if I forge or make anything for you ever again, you little Golden Turd...~<br>
<br>
The comment Apollo made earlier still ringing in his head, &quot;Besides Hepheastus, and Hermaphrodite all divinities are beautiful in their own right...&quot;.  He knew he himself was not beautiful and far from glamorous, but not a single deity on Olympus would dispute the fact that he created some of the most beautiful items ever, and for that reason he was offended.  <br>
<br>
His gaze then turned to his wife, as he returned the smile she gave him.  He sort of expected the wink at Ares and therefore showed no reaction of jealousy to it.:: <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uixhephaestusxi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>IX Hephaestus XI</A> at: 11/27/01 1:55:45 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub11.ezboard.com/uthegreatapollo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Great Apollo</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.maialino.it/musica/bsb_nick.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bronze Warrior</span><br>  Posts: 156<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/27/01 4:56:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub11.ezboard.com/famazonsunitefrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=174>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://bboysfans.tripod.com//sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/cuero.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sitting in the corner observing...</span><hr size=1> Apollo felt a ping in the back of his head. His stock had just dropped a point or two, he felt it. He was in the middle of very heated, very buzzed conversation yet he stopped and turned to Hephaestus, his brown eyes fixed upon the golden god. Apollo's eyes narrowed in thought, he had said so many things. What could have gotten to Hephaestus. AH HAH. That whole, ugly god thing. Apollo's face wrinkled without him knowing it. He was rather hideous...and his leg, all shriveled and ugly. Apollo quivered. Wanting to make amends with his brother Apollo excused himself fromt he conversation. He snapped to a serving boy, and motioned that he wanted wine, 2 glasses. The boy hurried with the whine, and Apollo walked from him without so much as a 'thank  you'.<br>
<br>
He was on a mission, and Hephaestus was his main objective. He stopped before his half brother, a smile on his face. He handed the goblet down to Hephaestus, who took it, his face emotionless.<br>
<br>
&quot;Such an event today. Wasn't it? Gives me chills all over.&quot; Apollo smiled to Hephaestus, that look still cold. This was starting to get to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!!!&quot; he almost screamed.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry for calling you ugly.&quot; Apollo almost studdered in saying the word sorry. He so rarely apologized to anyone, feeling he was always right and all.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your not ugly...just different. And anyway. Your mind is beautiful. I mean, only you would be able to fashion a palace as grand as my own.&quot; Apollo's eyes almost turned to stars invisioning his palace upon Olympus. It was the biggest and most lavish after that of his father. Apollo's face turned down, as his eyes became truly sincere. <br>
<br>
&quot;Really brother, I am sorry. I was just trying to prove a point.&quot; Apollo rested his hand on Hephaestus' shoulder.<br>
<br>
Just as he did such, the Muses all screamed out his name, motioning for him to come over. He smiled to Hephaestus and jogged back to his conversation circle.<br>
