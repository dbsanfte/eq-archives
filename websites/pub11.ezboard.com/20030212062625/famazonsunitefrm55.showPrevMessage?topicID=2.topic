<br>
Sarabi stood before the Gates to the Village, she gave the Gaurds the Amazon peace signal and saluted them. She waited til they had confirmed with the Queens to let her pass.<br>
She pulled back her dark long hair into a pony tail, after, she tugged on her battle skirt lightly adjusting it to it's proper position. The Priestess then waited patiently for her passage to the Village. <br>
Queen Rhiannon met Sarabi at the gates herself. She wasn't quite sure if it was proper for a Queen to welcome newcomers, but she has never really been on for protocol anyway.<br>
Sarabi had a definite presence about her, and Rhia found herself smiling warmly at the high priestess as she greeted her.<br>
&quot;Priestess Sarabi, welcome to our tribe.  Please, follow me. I will bring you to meet our War Queen, Chiara, and we will arrange a place for you to stay. I'm sure you've had a long trip up the mountains.&quot; <br>
Sarabi smiled as she was greeted by Queen Rhiannon. By clicking her bracers together in the formal Amazon salute and kneeling before the Queen with a fist of her heart she showed her undying loyalty.<br>
She dare not move til told to by the Queen.<br>
&quot;Yasoo, It is an honour to meet you and serve you.&quot;<br>
Sarabi was being formal with this Queen because she was not sure if this tribe was of formailty or not. <br>
Rhiannon looked confused for the briefest second and then laughed.<br>
&quot;Get up, get up! I appreciate the gesture, but I am not used to being treated like a Queen yet. We can save all the formal stuff for the Hall.&quot;<br>
She offers Sarabi her hand.  <br>
Sarabi took the Queen's hand, stood from her position and lightly dusted off her knee. She smiled at the Vasilissa.<br>
&quot;Nai, Vasilissa. Forgive me, Formailty is a sort of curse for me.&quot;<br>
Sarabi followed Rhiannon as told. <br>
As Rhiannon directed Sarabi through the village, she pointed out all the different buildings.<br>
&quot;This is the Smithy, and that's the mess hall..&quot;<br>
They stopped in front of a large stone building.<br>
&quot;This is our temple to Artemis. I know that you're the High Priestess of Athena, but I&quot;m sure you'll want to look around the temple anyway. Right next door here is the Hall. Chiara should be inside.&quot; <br>
Naiba looks around, when she sees someone that she does not know wandering through the village with Rhia. She walks up to them, looking very much the shy one.<br>
&quot;Hello&quot; she says quietly, looking at the ground. &quot;My name is Naiba Indrani.&quot;<br>
Sarabi nodded and smiled as the Queen spoke. When a fellow sister approaches, Sarabi clicked her bracers together in the Amazon salute.<br>
&quot;Yasoo, Athelfi.&quot; <br>
Naiba quickly scoots away, not used to having people talk with her.<br>
Rhiannon was by now used to Naiba, and her incredible shyness, and so didn't even blink an eye when she came up, introduced herself, and left.<br>
She directed the High Priestess towards the door to the Hall. <br>
Naiba followed behind them, not sure if she wanted to be seen, but knowing that Rhiannon would know that she was following. Also, given that the Queen was used to her shyness, she might also want her to talk to this Sarabi woman...<br>
Dori could feel the wind against her face as she raced Apollo through the trees of the Amazon forest.  She had a good horse length lead on Tristin behind her.  She could see the clearing up ahead and finally the horse broke through, coming into the west side of the village.  Up ahead Dori could see the made up finish line.  There was a hitching pole in front of the Great Hall, and then a fench just behind the building.  She slide down off her horse without even slowing down.  She could hear Tristin doing the same behind her.  She quickly hitched Apollo to the pole and took off for the fence.  She was running full out, when she saw Queen Rhia and someone else walking toward the Hall in front of her.  It was either run them over or....  She pushed off the ground and flipped into a tight ball, flying over both women, landing sofly, then taking the two steps to the fence, touching it.  She turned and smirked at Tristin and then gave the Queen a humble smile.  &quot;Sorry.&quot; <br>
Rhiannon jumped, having not heard the princess come up behind them, let alone jump over and land in front of them. After a second, she recovered, and smiled and nodded as she spoke.<br>
&quot;That's quite alright, Doriana. Dust yourself off and meet the High Priestess of Athena, Sarabi Falco.&quot; She gestured to Sarabi and then back to Dori. &quot;Priestess Sarabi, this is our Princess, Doriana.&quot; <br>
Sarabi nodded and saluted the Princess.<br>
&quot;Yasoo, Prigkipissa. Honour to meet you.&quot;<br>
Sarabi liked meeting new people, even though she sucked at conversations. <br>
Naiba shyly walks over to them again, bowing quickly to the princess and to the queen.<br>
&quot;I could show Sarabi around for a bit if you would like.&quot; she says quietly.<br>
Rhiannon nods to Naiba. She knows how unusual it is for the shy woman to speak up like this, so she agrees.<br>
&quot; If Sarabi would like a tour of the village, then be my guest. Although she may want to go to her hut first and rest from her journey.<br>
Dori felt a little foolish about her display in front of the Queen.  It was a little different between her and Rhia, then it was with Chiara.  She knew her boundries around Chiara, but with the new Queen that took her mothers position she didn't really know where she stood.  She listened at Naiba offered to show Sarabi around, knowing that this would be postive for the shy woman.  Quietly as she could, Dori tried to inch away from the group, scanning the village for her absent best friend, the one she was going to throttle once again.  She had turned and was about to take off, when she heard the Queen's voice. <br>
Rhiannon noticed the princess slowly easing away from the group. She wanted her to stay, but didn't want to make it sound like an order. As hard as she had been trying to form a friendship wih the two, it seemed that the death of Aella still stood between them.<br>
&quot;Where're you going Doriana?&quot; <br>
Naiba smiles slightly at Dori, who was so obviously trying to sneak away, deciding that maybe she would allow herself to talk, she called out.<br>
“If you are going to sneak away princess, may I suggest you take some lessons from the master?” she tapped her chest, indicating herself.<br>
It was true though, she was very good at not been noticed, after all, she had been practicing for years now. She waited to see how the Queen and Princess would respond to her rare joke.<br>
Laughing out loud at Naiba joke, she nodded, &quot;Perhaps I should take lessons from you.  I guess myself in enough trouble, that I'll need to learn how to sneak away unnoticed.&quot;  Winking at Naiba, Dori turned to Rhia, &quot;My Queen, you are too cleaver for me to sneak away from you.  How about we leave our visitor with Naiba and you and I take a walk, I need to take Apollo to the stables for a rub down.&quot;  Dori decided it was about time for her to extend the olive brach and she hoped the Queen would except. <br>
Naiba nods and turns to Sarabi.<br>
&quot;Where would you like to go?&quot;<br>
It is sad so quiet that it is nearly unhearble<br>
Rhia was startled, but pleased at Dori's offer. The healer turned Queen paused for a moment, considering.<br>
She turned to Sarabi.<br>
&quot;Are you up for a tour of the village, Priestess?&quot;<br>
They all waited for Sarabi to decide what she would like to do.   <p><center> <img src = "http://user.netomia.com/angelkim/rhia.png"><br>

She picked up Apollo's reins to lead him to the stables. It was an attempt at helpfulness, one she hoped the princess wouldn't get upset about. Amazon women were touchy about their horses sometimes.  <p><center> <img src = "http://user.netomia.com/angelkim/rhia.png"><br>
