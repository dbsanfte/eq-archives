      <td>With a new expansion out and another long learning process ahead of us, I thought that I would take a moment to reflect on the Planes of Power expansion.

      <tr>
        <td height="265"><p>As we set out on our journeys and wandered  the new zones, we discovered the new system of flagging. We thought it was great at first. No key camping (Vex Thal, anyone? /cough)! However, that feeling didn't last long. From having to get flags in a particular order to back-flagging, the system became increasingly annoying. You HAD to complete the hedge event to get into Plane of Nightmares B. You couldn't just send your applicants along with other raids and have them get their flags out of order. You HAD to be flagged to enter certain zones. There were no ifs, ands, or buts about this. Around the time we were really getting into the expansion and kicking serious ass, they made a few changes: the Seer allowed you to get your flags out of order. You could enter zones even when you were not flagged, and you could pick and chose your targets based on ease and availability, and not on the question &quot;what flag do we need next?&quot;. Finally, something good done in the expansion! Those changes alone gave many other guilds the opportunity to grow and progress quickly. </p>
          <p>So how about some other changes? Lets Review:</p>        </td>

          <p>Then there was Rallos Zek. This guy was changed multiple times. One of the first changes was tethering the first version, making the encounter slightly more annoying. Then there were the 72-person limit and minor changes to the number of adds within the encounter. It was (and still is) a very interesting encounter, but I think most of our warriors in Fury's Edge are still bitter for having to kill him 11 times before getting our first Blade of War. </p>
          <p>Finally, we were off to kill Sol Ro and gain acess to the last Elemental Plane, the Plane of Fire. After the Rallos Zek kill we immediately zoned into Sol Ro, killed the five mini's and met up with Sol Ro himself. It was 5am and we were determined. I think we were a little let down when we found out how utterly gimp he was. </p>        </td>

          <p>Xegony 2.0. We never got a taste of the first version, she was beefed up a little before we got to her, but she was changed one more time. Now you have to deal with her guards. What a slutty model tho. To the developers at SOE, the men and mangina's in Fury's Edge salute you!</p>
          <p>Coirnav was fun for all of us; a different event all-around. But the timer took some getting used to, especially after being changed so much. It was very frustrating to come so close to winning this event on multiple occasions, only to either run out of time (when one minute would have made all the difference) or to have one minor misstep cause a wipe. We did pull through finally, and it was a rush when we did make that first kill.. </p>

We can do anything thrown our way and we enjoy figuring out a good challenge. Allowing CotH did make the event a little less stressful and made it go by much faster. Not only did it give other guilds that were getting hung up on this encounter a chance to beat it, but our attendance was much better. It was easy to convince people to do Rathe, once we began finishing it in under an hour. </p>        </td>
