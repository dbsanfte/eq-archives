<p><font color="#88A569" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">History
of Amazon</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#C6D58A">Amazon
began long before Amazon Books, but long after the Amazon in South America or of
Mythological fame.&nbsp; It began on a large MUD (multi-user dimension) as a
primarily female guild, in keeping with the mythological genre of it's
origins.&nbsp; It slowly evolved into a guild of both sexes, into what would be
called an &quot;uber&quot; guild on Everquest.&nbsp; One of the largest, Amazon
usually defeated it's &quot;enemies&quot; in clan battles. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#C6D58A">It's
original leader was ousted from this large MUD, after having lured one of the
mud's male founding members into an online relationship, having discovered this
&quot;female&quot; was indeed a male.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#C6D58A">Amazon
was called in to vote for a new leader, and after a vote of some 50+ unique
members, Foxglove was chosen, although she was a relative newcomer to the guild
(2 weeks).&nbsp; This is where the beginnings of the new &quot;Amazon&quot;
guild begin. Amazon now thinks primarily of a player's innate integrity. This
combined with intelligence and wisdom usually breeds a player that is an asset
to any guild and a pleasure to have around. Foxglove invited several new members
into Amazon, Drydon was among them, having witnessed his generous hearted nature
and extraordinary gameplay know-how.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#C6D58A">The
guild continued to grow on this large mud, gaining respect and causing players
to seek membership.&nbsp; Not long after, the MUD decided on a player file purge
and this upset a great many members of Amazon.&nbsp; So Foxglove decided to
begin a MUD of her own as a haven for the discord. This new mud continues today,
although Foxglove is rarely actively involved, having delegated most of the
responsibilities to others more suited to the tasks.&nbsp; She put an incredible
amount of her time and effort into the game, acquiring excellent programmers,
mature, friendly staff, writing areas and orchestrating the &quot;world&quot; of
the new game for years and came to a point, being artistically inclined, she
desired more out of it than could feasibly be carried out with the staff at hand
(it is, and always will be played free of charge and is a text-based game).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#C6D58A">Amazon
doesn't take well to rudeness to others, dishonesty, selfishness and greed.
Rather, the aim is for people with a genuine balance of heart, intelligence,
wisdom and spirit. The aim of Amazon will never be how best to hoard players to
better swarm spawns for uber-loot. But rather how to form a gathering of people
of a kindred spirit who genuinely enjoy one another's company and respect. We
believe this attracts only the sincerest form of player to the guild.</font></p>
