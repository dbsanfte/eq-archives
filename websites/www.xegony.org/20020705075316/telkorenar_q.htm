<p>'Hail Telkorenar'</p>
<p>Telkorenar says 'The strong seek me out, for one reason or another. It seems
you have come here in peace. Perhaps you wish to prove yourself a mighty
fighter? I respect only might Wood Elf.</p>
<p>'I wish to prove myself a mighty fighter.'</p>
<p>Telkorenar says 'For the mighty I have four tests. The test of the tooth, the
test of the flame, the test of the fire storm and the test of protection. Which
test do you wish to undertake?</p>
<p>'What is the test of the tooth?'</p>
<p>Telkorenar says 'With tooth and nail you must fight, deep into the halls of
testing. Recover the white tear of power, the white symbol for purity the silver
symbol to calm ones self and a glowing orb. If you can return these to me I will
know you are a mighty fighter indeed.</p>
<p>'What is the test of the flame?'</p>
<p>Telkorenar says 'Return the black tear, the black symbol the poison symbol
and the serrated symbol to me, and you will have completed the test of flame.
Your reward will be quite suitable to one who enters the fray of battle.</p>
<p>'What is the test of the fire storm?'</p>
<p>Telkorenar says 'Become like a fire storm and bring your wrath upon the
inhabitants of the halls of testing. Return when you have the tear of poison and
the serrated tear along with the a symbol kissed by flames and a ruby symbol.</p>
<p>'What is the test of protection?'</p>
<p>Telkorenar says 'My fire will protect you if you are strong enough to endure
this test. A ruby tear like my flames, an emerald tear, like a forest ready to
burn, an emerald symbol and a platinum symbol are what I seek. With these I will
forge pauldrons unlike any you have ever seen mortal. Go now and seek out what I
desire.</p>
<p>All these things drop in the Halls of Testing. But the tears drop only off of
Dozekar the Cursed</p>
