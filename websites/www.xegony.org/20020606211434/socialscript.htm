<p>NOTE: This is a straight copy from the updated Everquest ROK Supplement
manual.</p>
<p>Social Scripting</p>
<p>EverQuest now supports a total of 120 configurable &quot;socials&quot; in
game, as opposed to the previous 12. Along with these additional socials, there
have been several enhancements to your ability to develop custom emotes and
sequences of commands:</p>
<p>Custom Animation Text</p>
<p>EverQuest has default text for all existing animations. For instance, when
typing /point, or /point with a specified target (e.g. /point Blibby), your
character will execute the &quot;point&quot; animation and &quot;CharacterName
points at &lt;target&gt;&quot; will be displayed to all other characters in your
vicinity.</p>
<p>You can now use the animation, but substitute your own text. To do this you
need to specify the &quot;target&quot; after the command as &quot;say&quot;
followed by your custom text. For instance, typing &quot;/point say points at a
dangerous creature indicating that he is ready to kill it&quot; will cause your
character to execute the &quot;point&quot; animation and display &quot;CharacterName
points at a dangerous creature indicating that he is ready to kill it&quot; to
those nearby.</p>
<p>Emote Codes</p>
<p>When creating custom socials, you can now use a series of &quot;%-codes&quot;
that expand into various pieces of information when the social is executed.<br>
</p>
<p>The %-codes are:</p>
<p>%T - Returns the current target.<br>
%S - Returns the subjective gender-specific pronoun for the target (He, She,
It).<br>
%O - Returns the objective gender-specific pronoun for the target (Him, Her,
It).<br>
%P - Returns the possessive gender-specific pronoun for the target (His, Her,
Its).<br>
%R - Returns the race of the target (only works on Player characters).</p>
<p>For example, if you have a target of &quot;a gnoll&quot;, the following
emote:</p>
<p>/point say points at %T indicating that he is ready to kill %O.</p>
<p>...Your character will execute the &quot;point&quot; animation with a text
output of &quot;CharacterName points at a gnoll indicating that he is ready to
kill it.&quot;<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Pauses in Social Batches</p>
<p>You may now enter pauses in social batches with the /pause command. /pause
takes an argument from 1 to 600, with the value being equal to the number of
tenths of seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause).</p>
<p>For example, a social consisting of:</p>
<p>/sit off<br>
/cast 1<br>
/pause 100<br>
/sit on</p>
<p>...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds
after you've STARTED casting the spell, and sit down.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as another
social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the pause command is
specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on the same line.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>/sit off<br>
/pause 100,/cast 1<br>
/sit on</p>
<p>...would have the same effect as the example above. It is important to note
that the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from another, and
MUST be specified first on the line.</p>
