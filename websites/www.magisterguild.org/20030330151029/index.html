	<p>Hi. I wish I had some great humor, biting sarcasm, and tube sock pics
	for you tonight. Unfortunately, I am simply still stuck in awe... of these 
	people:</p>
	<a href='images/people.jpg'><IMG width='500' SRC = 'images/people.jpg'></a>
	<p>I'd like to think that I have had (and will continue to have) an interesting life.
	I have met many people, from many countries (yes, before EQ :p)... people of 
	all walks of life, interests, and careers. But I have never before, nor will I 
	ever again, meet such an amazing bunch of cocksucking bastards and jizzlapping 
	assmonkeys like the ones that I spend most of my days with now : this guild. 
	You can't really understand what I mean until you talk to these guys and girls 
	every day... see them hang out day to day, take care of each other, and then, 
	when the word is given, come together and turn into a military machine that 
	would impress West Point's finest.</p>
	<p>I have no doubt that other guilds will kill Xegony in her current form, and 
	I'm sure that eventually she will be called easy, but at the moment, she is an 
	impressive challenge. On our second day of playing around with her, the strategy 
	just clicked, everyone suddenly understood exactly what had to be done, and 
	before the kill was even made, I was completely certain of victory. The fight 
	is simply a blast, start to finish. Calling it the most fun encounter in PoP 
	this far, is no exaggeration.</p>
	<p>Everquest gets quite a bit of bad press, and within the Everquest community, 
	uberguilds get even more bad press. Parents and politicians claim that people 
	are wasting their lives staring at computer screens... hell, I've heard that 
	phrase spoken to me more times than I can count. But I ask any of you, how 
	many chances will you have in life to work together with 60 or more people... 
	spend every night with them, make them your best friends, and come together 
	to succeed in a common love - the conquest of a virtual world, where no blood 
	is shed, no children are starved, and nobody's life is ruined just to fill the 
	pockets of another? I have that chance... and I intend to use it to it's fullest.</p>
	<p>And now that I've made you suffer through my speech... here's what you really 
	wanted to see in this update: PUSSY!</p>

	</tr>
	</TR>
	</table>
	<ul>
	<font face=Verdana size=2>
	<p>I would like to begin this update by appealing to the readers who 
	possess a basic grasp of the english language and understand simple 
	concepts about communication through writing: the following text is 
	completely devoid of irony or sarcasm and should be read as-is. In 
	fact, unless you are just deathly bored, I suggest you skip it.</p>
	<p>Okay, now for the rest of you: It has come to my attention, through 
	x-server tells, posts, irc PMs, and local tells(sometimes from my own 
	idiot guildmembers), that my updates may not be completely understood. 
	I regularly get tells like 'dewd why you h8 triton' or 'fennin was SO 
	EZ why you h8 triton' or 'so who sent you those tells, really?', or my 
	favorite, 'dude that was some nasty shit you wrote to yourself.'</p>
	<p>I don't really want to field all these tells, so I've decided to write 
	a Cliff Notes that I can refer people to from now on. I'm assuming zero 
	IQ so I'll even explain what Cliff Notes are : they're a shortened version 
	of a book, along with the typical classroom analysis. They are mainly 
	targetted for stupid and lazy students who want to cheat through their 
	english courses. </p>
	<p>So here it is folks :</p>
	<p><b>Cliff Notes: Magister Updates</b></p>
	<p>Summary</p>
	<p>The word that best describes these updates is irony. Look it up in Cliff Notes : 
	Webster's Dictionary.</p>
	<p><b>Rallos Zek update</b>: Clearly, the author doesn't really think that differences 
	of a day or a week make one guild better than another. Also, the claim of 
	minute-by-minute updates... is probably not serious. Indeed, it is doubtful 
	that Magister killed all three waves of the Rallos Zek event in seven minutes. 
	Could the author's claim that his guild has the largest schlong in the universe 
	be serious? The question is left to the reader.</p>
	<p><b>Fennin Ro update</b>: Given the first few paragraphs of the Rallos Zek update, 
	one might reasonably be led to the conclusion that any claims of superiority in 
	the following update could possibly, just maybe, be ironic. Due to the nature of
	Everquest, it is also in doubt whether or not the author has an intimate knowledge 
	of the drug habits of leaders and officers of a guild on another server. They 
	should probably stop sending him x-server tells explaining that they don't 
	actually abuse drugs.</p>
	<p><b>The Interview update</b>: This is a great example of what the english-speaking
	world likes to refer to as a contrast. The reader is presented with the totally 
	off-the-wall tells filled with sexually explicit imagery, juxtaposed with the 
	serious and normal Interviewer who remains unchanged. The totally ridiculous 
	interview, and the statement that Mflixkoryossack is a typical member of the 
	Erollisi Marr community, should probably not be taken seriously. The bar at the 
	bottom that delineates the interview from the two statements about the source of 
	the tells and the status of the site, and the serious tone of those statements, 
	lead one to believe that there, for once, the author was in fact not sarcastic.
	<p>The End.</p>
	<p>I hope that helped folks... if you still have questions for me, please direct 
	your tells to my secretary at veeshan.Destinae. If she's not too busy under my 
	desk, she'll be happy to schedule an appointment for you.</p>
	<p>[Cliff Notes addendum : the latest update : yea no shit dest is a guy, jesus 
	fucking christ you're dumb. ]</p>

	<p>It seems that things are brewing in the geopolitical structure of the Erollisi Marr server.
	To try and explain the situation, an anonymous representative of the masses has come forward and
	allowed us to do this exclusive interview.</p>

	<p><i>Interviewer</i> : Thank you for coming. We were hoping that you, as a member of the 
	Erollisi Marr community, could shed some light on the current goings-on. Perhaps maybe
	even tell us about the aspirations and dreams of the average player.
	<br><img src='images/quote1.jpg'></p>
	<p><i>Interviewer</i> : Fascinating. And who is this Aackman? Well I suppose it's not important.
	What else would you like to discuss today?
	<br><img src='images/quote2.jpg'></p>

	<p><i>Interviewer</i> : Your insight into the sociological forces driving the server culture is
	refreshing. But who are you anyway?
	<br><img src='images/quote3.jpg'></p>
	<p><i>Interviewer</i> : There you have it folks... straight from the source.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>For you doubters out there, yes, those tells are <b>real</b> and were not sent by anyone in the guild,
	or anyone I know for that matter. I didn't even have to respond, they just kept coming...</p>
	<p>In other news, we will be moving our site soon, so try not to panic if it comes down for a short while.</p>

  <p><font face='Verdana' size='2'>It was THIS &gt;&lt; close man! We will get him next 
time, I promise, FOR SURE!</font></p>
<p><font face='Verdana' size='2'>But first, a digression...</font></p>
<p><font face='Verdana' size='2'>The debate about the best guilds in Everquest 
rages on daily. The flames are intense, the discussions heated... the evidence 
is presented, and the histories and accomplishments of guilds are evaluated. All 
in a constant quest to prove that your guild (or your favorite guild) is the 
best of the best.</font></p>
<p><font face='Verdana' size='2'>Today... everything changes. You see, as time 
has passed since the release of Everquest, the top guilds have been closer and 
closer to each other in terms of defeating content. While it used to be that the 
top guilds were separated by many weeks or months, the difference is now 
measured in one or two mobs.</font></p>
<p><font face='Verdana' size='2'>Lately, guilds are so pressed to prove their 
mettle that they post weekly, or even DAILY updates of how close they are to 
defeating the next encounter, to show that they are farther ahead of the rest. 
Well, Magister believes in strong competition, and just like everyone else we 
KNOW we are the best, so today, we are taking the game to a whole new level. 
That's right folks, we will provide you, the EQ uberguild website troll, with 
updates of HOW CLOSE we are... </font></p>
<p><font face='Verdana' size='2'><B>BY THE MINUTE!</B></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face='Verdana' size='2'>The stage is set... Plane of Tactics. The 
invincible army of Magister knocks at the door of the Warlord, weapons 
gleaming... their armor stained with the blood of a thousand defeated foes, 
their massive schlongs flapping carelessly in the breeze...</font></p>
<p><font face='Verdana' size='2'><B>MINUTE ONE - The Zek twins!</B></font></p>
<p><font face='Verdana' size='2'><img border='0' src='update3.jpg' width='400'></font></p>
<p><font face='Verdana' size='2'>Yes, it was impossible, but that didn't stop us 
from doing it! Er wait... where's my dictionary... ah ok here we go. Here we 
defeat this VERY DIFFICULT and EXTREMELY HARD portion of the event. As you can 
see from the picture, our attendance was somewhat wanting. By the way... this 
shows only half of this HIGHLY TOUGH wave.</font></p>
<p><font face='Verdana' size='2'><B>MINUTE TWO</B> - Rallos Zek!</font></p>
<p><font face='Verdana' size='2'><img border='0' src='update5.jpg' width='328' height='368'></font></p>
<p><font face='Verdana' size='2'>Dear Diary, Day 6 or 60 or shit I forget how 
many days it's been since our guildies coded this encounter but shit, we beat 
him!</font></p>
<p><font face='Verdana' size='2'><B>MINUTE THREE</B> - Rallos Zek... again?</font></p>
<p><font face='Verdana' size='2'>Damn we work fast. Here in the first minute of 
the final fight, our valiant heroes do significant damage:</font></p>
<p><font face='Verdana' size='2'><img border='0' src='update1.jpg' width='154' height='41'></font></p>
<p><font face='Verdana' size='2'><B>MINUTE FOUR</B>... a surprise attack, but only a 
small problem:</font></p>
<p><font face='Verdana' size='2'><img border='0' src='update6.jpg' width='280' height='199'></font></p>
<p><font face='Verdana' size='2'>I guildremoved at least five developers for not 
warning me about this, but thankfully we were able to massively exploit pathing 
to completely trivialize this part of the encounter. Tokens all around! There 
was no time to waste, so we really put our backs into it in minute five:</font></p>
<p><font face='Verdana' size='2'><img border='0' src='ralloszek1.jpg' width='154' height='40'></font></p>
<p><font face='Verdana' size='2'>Well I don't really know what the fuck happened 
there but I guildremoved some more developers, and low and behold, minute six:</font></p>
<p><font face='Verdana' size='2'><img border='0' src='update2.jpg' width='156' height='41'></font></p>
<p><font face='Verdana' size='2'>That's right folks, THE FIRST LEGIT SERVERWIDE 
48% OF RALLOS ZEK ANYWHERE is right where it belongs... on the same server as 
the largest collective guild schlong in the universe.</font></p>

it... I lied, it wasn't even close, we owned:</font></p>
