	<p>With an incredible 63 people, the last Rathe Councilmember drops. 
	At the fights conclusion, only 12 people were left standing with a mere <b>SEVEN
	SECONDS</b> to spare before the encounter resets forcing us to start all over again!
	What about the Avatar of Earth you ask? A huge pussy compared to what we
	had just experienced...he dropped faster than Asmira's prom dress on prom night.<br><br>
	That may not seem like an accomplishment of epic proportion until you understand
	that one small mistake in the execution of the strategy can send you right back
	to the start of the encounter erasing hours worth of work in an instant.
	<br><br>
	Forget it...you can't understand how hard it is until you try it for yourself.
	Congrats to Teneras on the Chestguard of Enchanted Marble and Maeel on the second
	Earthspine Staff!<br><br></p>

	<p>Hi. I wish I had some great humor, biting sarcasm, and tube sock pics
	for you tonight. Unfortunately, I am simply still stuck in awe... of these 
	people:</p>
	<a href='images/people.jpg'><IMG width='500' SRC = 'images/people.jpg'></a>
	<p>I'd like to think that I have had (and will continue to have) an interesting life.
	I have met many people, from many countries (yes, before EQ :p)... people of 
	all walks of life, interests, and careers. But I have never before, nor will I 
	ever again, meet such an amazing bunch of cocksucking bastards and jizzlapping 
	assmonkeys like the ones that I spend most of my days with now : this guild. 
	You can't really understand what I mean until you talk to these guys and girls 
	every day... see them hang out day to day, take care of each other, and then, 
	when the word is given, come together and turn into a military machine that 
	would impress West Point's finest.</p>
	<p>I have no doubt that other guilds will kill Xegony in her current form, and 
	I'm sure that eventually she will be called easy, but at the moment, she is an 
	impressive challenge. On our second day of playing around with her, the strategy 
	just clicked, everyone suddenly understood exactly what had to be done, and 
	before the kill was even made, I was completely certain of victory. The fight 
	is simply a blast, start to finish. Calling it the most fun encounter in PoP 
	this far, is no exaggeration.</p>
	<p>Everquest gets quite a bit of bad press, and within the Everquest community, 
	uberguilds get even more bad press. Parents and politicians claim that people 
	are wasting their lives staring at computer screens... hell, I've heard that 
	phrase spoken to me more times than I can count. But I ask any of you, how 
	many chances will you have in life to work together with 60 or more people... 
	spend every night with them, make them your best friends, and come together 
	to succeed in a common love - the conquest of a virtual world, where no blood 
	is shed, no children are starved, and nobody's life is ruined just to fill the 
	pockets of another? I have that chance... and I intend to use it to it's fullest.</p>
	<p>And now that I've made you suffer through my speech... here's what you really 
	wanted to see in this update: PUSSY!</p>
