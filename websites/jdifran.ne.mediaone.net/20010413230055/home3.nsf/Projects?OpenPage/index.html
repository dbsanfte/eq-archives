<FONT FACE="Arial">The following are web applications that I have developed in my spare time.  Like this site, they are also hosted on my own Domino server via a cable-modem internet connection.</FONT><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.asheronscall.com" TARGET="_new"><FONT COLOR="0000ff" FACE="Arial">Asheron's Call</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial"> is a Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game (MMOLRPG) published by Microsoft and developed by </FONT><A HREF="http://www.turbinegames.com" TARGET="_new"><FONT COLOR="0000ff" FACE="Arial">Turbine Entertainment Software</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial">.  This site is the &quot;Guild Hall&quot; for an in-game &quot;Allegiance&quot; called Azeraphel's Sarcastic Kingdom.  (On the site, I am known as Radaz.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The site features information about the Allegiance, several public and private discussion boards, an image gallery, a fiction library, a marketplace for bartering for in-game goods, and other features.</FONT><BR>

<A HREF="http://jdifran.ne.mediaone.net/Enchanters" TARGET="_new"><B><FONT COLOR="0000ff" FACE="Arial">EverQuest Enchanters Discussion:</FONT></B></A><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial">EverQuest is another  (MMOLRPG) with a following of several hundred thousand players.  I developed this web-based discussion in R4.6, then upgraded it to R5.  At one time the site was receiving 1,500 hits through the entrance portal every day, with around 100,000 page-loads per day.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The website it was affiliated with, Caster's Realm, expanded beyond my ability to support.  It has since changed to a different Discussion Board system, so visits to the EQ Enchanters discussion have recently trailed off.  However, the site is still available for the small community of players who prefer its design over the new system.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial">This website was developed in R4.6 to provide a simple website for NHAPT.  I am not currently active in the organization, but continue to host and update the website whenever members send me information.</FONT></FORM>
