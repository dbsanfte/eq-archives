<FORM><img src="/skinner.nsf/gallery/BE3FAC4D35D57D70852569FF006FC8E6/$FILE/askTitle.jpg"><p><span class="banner">ASK Charter</span><br>
<P>We, the people of Azeraphel Lorekeeper, do hereby set forth this charter... <BR>
<BR>
Our online community spans (will span) multiple worlds and though each world will have its own specific Amendments, it is this Charter which unites us. <p><span class="banner">A. Azeraphel's Sarcastic Kingdom</span><br>
<P>On all worlds we are commited<BR>
... to evangelize Yee<BR>
... to have fun.<BR>
... to promote roleplaying.<BR>
... to learn all there is to know.<BR>
... to have more fun.<BR>
<BR>
we also strive<BR>
... to be honest in all our dealings, except when mocking d00ds.<BR>
... to seek out new and interesting ways and places to get our characters killed.<BR>
... to make the Azeraphelian way available to the common citizen, and welcome the common citizen into our fold, provided said common citizen can converse and socialize in a vaguely mature fashion.<BR>
<BR>
In short, we seek to make the worlds a more enjoyable place to be, by entirely subverting them to our will (in a friendly fashion, of course.)<BR>
<p><span class="banner">B. ASK Code of Conduct</span><br>
<P>ASK Members are expected to be active participants in the ASK online community as a whole and the in-game Chapter(s) to which they belong.<BR>
<BR>
All ASK members must abide the Code of Conduct of the respective game worlds.<BR>
<BR>
ASK Members do not engage in any activity which harms the well-being, reputation, or quality of ASK as a whole or theofficial ASK Chapters in their respective game worlds. Cheating, exploiting, stealing, conning and such come to mind.<BR>
<BR>
ASK members who play a particular game are strongly encouraged to join the local ASK Chapter in that game. ASK members who choose not to join a particular ASK Chapter in a game may have their access to that game's Discussion Board blocked if necessary to protect that ASK Chapter.<BR>
<BR>
Azeraphelians, as a general rule, do not powerlevel exploits or endlessly camp for phat loot. (We may do these things when it suits our military objectives, such as to complete quests.)  <BR>
<p><span class="banner">C. ASK General Guidelines</span><br>
<P>Read the board(s). It's our best method of communication and planning. Even if you don't want to post much, make sure you check it out for news, and make sure new recruits know about it.<BR>
<BR>
<p><span class="banner">D. ASK Recruiting Guidelines</span><br>
<P>Our recruitment objective is to fill our ranks with quality Players.  A good ASK candidate is...<BR>
a. A mature player<BR>
b. A casual roleplayer<BR>
c. A witty and sarcastic player, as defined by... er, uh, hmm. As defined by example: Monty Python, Douglas Adams, Gary Larson, Scott Adams, George Carlin. One who can laugh at other's and their own foibles - like Radaz not getting offended when &quot;doing a Radaz&quot; became the new catch-phrase for falling to one's death. Or Yu getting booted during her Quiz. Or Boylston eating his Composite Crossbow with a mana stone. (Okay, that last one wasn't funny.) <BR>
<BR>
<p><span class="banner">E. Mentoring and New Applicants</span><br>
<P>Anyone wishing to join ASK must post an application on the ASK Applicants section of the website.  ASK members will periodically review new membership requests, and will coordinate with applicants in order to Mentor them.<BR>
<BR>
The mentorship period should be, at the very minimum, one week. When applicants make their intent known on the Applicants board, existing members should publicly state that they will be mentoring the new applicant. Those mentors should take the time to get to know the applicant, adventure with the applicant, and teach the applicant what the Yee is all about.<BR>
<BR>
A new recruit will not be QUIZZED at their first meeting.<BR>
A new recruit must have the approval of no less than THREE existing Azeraphelians.<BR>
A new recruit may not be sponsored by a recently accepted recruit who knew them prior to joining ASK<BR>
<BR>
As a preface to every QUIZ, at least one of an applicant's mentors will be asked to tell a brief tale about the applicant, introducing them to everyone, and showing their support for the applicant's Yee. <BR>
<BR>
Anyone wishing to join ASK must post an application on the ASK Applicants section of the website. The QUIZ, of course, needs no explanation and will be performed in-game when practical, or via the ASK Chat Room or Discussion Board if necessary.<BR>
