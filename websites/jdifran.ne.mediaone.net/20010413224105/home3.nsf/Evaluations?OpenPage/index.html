<FONT FACE="Arial">Read what some of John DiFrancesco's students have said...</FONT><BR>
<UL><UL><I><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;John is an excellent instructor.  He has an in depth knowledge of the material and presents it well. &quot;</FONT></I><BR>
<BR>
<I><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;The instructor was very knowledgeable in the course material, and was able to communicate his knowledge concisely in an easy to understand fashion!&quot;</FONT></I><BR>
<BR>
<I><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;John was a very effective teacher, making the course both interesting and helpful.  I would definitely choose him as an instructor in the future.&quot;</FONT></I><BR>
<BR>
<I><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;John is the best Instructor I have had since college. His mix of knowledge, humor, attitude and enthusiasm was wonderful. I truly enjoyed him and his teaching style.&quot;</FONT></I><BR>
<BR>
<I><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;Instructor was great and really knew the material - Very enthusiastic and able to answer all questions with real life examples that work!&quot;</FONT></I><BR>
<BR>
<I><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;Have John back for any Notes classes we teach.  He is very competent and can verbalize the information needed to be taught in a way that even beginners can understand.  Addtionally, for those power users he was able to bring the class to the next degree.&quot;</FONT></I><BR>

<I><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;As a new user &amp; system administrator to Lotus Notes, John made the difficult task of understanding the complex material not only easy to understand but actually fun to learn.  He was able to break down complex administration tasks into easier to understand steps that actually made a great deal of sense when re-compiled into a complete operation.  He made the class a fun learning experience by combining previous examples &amp; situations that would give us great insight into setting up &amp; administrating a Notes enviornmnet in the real world. &quot;</FONT></I></UL></UL></FORM>
