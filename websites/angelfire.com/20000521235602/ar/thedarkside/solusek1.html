<td><font color="#C0C0C0">Solusek is located in the western part of <a href="lavastrm.html">Lavastorm</a>,
to the very north of the Antonica continent.&nbsp; The entrance to Solusek
if quite hidden as it is on the side of a large lava pool.&nbsp; It is
the cave like entrance closest to the Goblin camp located just next to
the lava pool.&nbsp; Be careful when trying to reach this entrance as you
do not want to fall in the lava pool and lose all your precious belongings</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Solusek is considered one of the most dangerous
dungeons in Norrath.&nbsp; It is not only filled with tough creatures but
also with little stairs on top of lava.&nbsp; One wrong step and you are
barbecue.&nbsp; You would expect that such a dangerous place would provide
good experience and loot.&nbsp; And that is not far from the truth.&nbsp;
The action in Solusek is almost non-stop and there are quite a few interesting
items to be found here.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">As soon as you zone into Solusek you will find
yourself in a small corridor that will take you to a stairs.&nbsp; These
stairs will lead to the actual Solusek dungeon and is often guarded by
one or two Goblins.&nbsp; These will almost always be Young Goblins (low
20s) or more rarely Cinder Goblins (low to mid 20s).&nbsp; You do not have
to worry about them so much if this is your first visit to Solusek as they
are not aggressive.&nbsp; Hail them and head down the stairs.&nbsp; If
you get to the bottom of it, you will see an axe in a zig zag motion.&nbsp;
Be careful with that one and do not attempt to head past it.&nbsp; Instead,
walk up a little until you can see a large crack in the wall.&nbsp; You
can go through that crack by bending down a little.&nbsp; Right past it
you will see two more Goblins and a path that will either take you further
downstairs, to your right or left. If you head right, you will get to a
dead end.&nbsp; To your left you will find quite a few goblins and an interesting
machine, similar to those found in the city of Ak'Anon.&nbsp; If you head
downstairs you will find a door that will take you to the second part of
Solusek A.</font><font color="#C0C0C0"></font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">That is a brief description of the entrance to
Solusek A and the area where mid 20 necromancers will want to hunt.&nbsp;
There is plenty more in Solusek but I have not yet explored it or even
gotten to Solusek B (likely THE most dangerous dungeon in Norrath from
what I have seen so far).&nbsp; Nevertheless, there is plenty to do at
the entrance.</font><font color="#C0C0C0"></font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">I would recommend necromancers that only necromancers
level 24+ come here as it is very difficult to fight solo creatures in
Solusek.&nbsp; You will often have to deal with 2 or more creatures at
the same time and a partner is a must.&nbsp; The best strategy is to simply
stay close to the zone.&nbsp; Even though the corridor you will be fighting
in is very small, it will keep you safe from trains or the lava that is
found all over Solusek.&nbsp; First, put your pet on guard on the corridor
and take out the Goblins that spawn close to zone.&nbsp; After you are
done with them, head down the stairs and take the Goblins that spawn close
to that dangerous axe.&nbsp; You are now ready to take the Goblin(s) that
spawn just past the crack on the wall.&nbsp; You can cast from the stairs
and I would advice that you do so.&nbsp; When taking the Goblin from past
the crack, be careful as he will rarely come alone.&nbsp; He should often
bring a friend along.&nbsp; When you kill it, you are done cleaning up
the path behind the crack and can now head past it.</font><font color="#C0C0C0"></font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Past he crack on the wall is where the fun really
starts.&nbsp; As I mentioned before, you should hunt with a patner in this
part of Solusek.&nbsp; Either you or your partner should head downstairs
to pull the Goblins.&nbsp; Whoever is going should leave his/her pet behind.&nbsp;
Just past the crack you should find two Goblins.&nbsp; They can be either
Young Goblins, Cinder Goblins, Goblin Shamans, or Goblin Wizards.&nbsp;
Make sure you tell your partner what you are pulling so that he knows what
to expect.&nbsp; Young Goblins and Cinder Goblins hit very hard but that
is pretty much what they do.&nbsp; Shamans and Wizards are a lot tougher
because they can cast some mean spells.&nbsp; The problem with Shamans
is that you will have to pull it and then head back to zone area, which
means you will have to go back through the crack on the wall.&nbsp; He
will most certainly try to root you before that.&nbsp; Wizards are very
nasty too as they cast powerful spells from pretty much as far as they
want (a bug perhaps?).&nbsp; I have actually died once all the way close
to the zone without even realizing I was taking damage.&nbsp; The wizard
was casting on me from miles away!&nbsp; Also be careful with the large
Drake that wanders around that area.&nbsp; If he is close by the time you
pull, he will also join the battle.&nbsp; And he can easily hit for 100+
damage per round (good loot though :)).&nbsp; By the time you are done
with these Goblins, either the Goblins you have killed before will have
spawned again or you can pull from further inside to the left.&nbsp; There
are two more Goblins at the end of the leftish path and two or three more
standing on a bridge.&nbsp; The farther you go the more I would recommend
that you cast Harmshield.&nbsp; It will provide some useful invulnerability
seconds to get back to zone.</font><font color="#C0C0C0"></font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">So, what is past all that?&nbsp; I do not know
either...&nbsp; I shalll go back to Solusek soon and updated this analysis.&nbsp;
But in the mean time, if you are an experienced Solusek hunter, send me
an <a href="mailto:skinner.tds@angelfire.com?subject=Solusek Analysis">email</a>.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">I still can't say exactly what I think of Solusek
since I do not know all of it yet.&nbsp; But I can say that I had a good
time when I was there.&nbsp; I have been there quite a few times and I
never saw anyone hunting in its deadly dungeon.&nbsp; If you are looking
for an empty zone, Solusek is your choice.&nbsp; All Goblins will be yours.&nbsp;
Of course, no one can hear you scream in space...</font></td>

Solusek is surrounded by lava outside and inside, so be very very careful.&nbsp;
Also be careful with the Goblin Wizards as they can cast from very far
away and those are the worst damage you can take.&nbsp; If you do not pay
attention, you won't even see you are about to die.</font>
