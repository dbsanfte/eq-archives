<TD colspan="2">INFORMATION: Roelan was acctually born in Freeport, but was an adventurous young lad, and at an early age wanted to get out and explore. He was captured by the tails of the other lands and beings of Norrath. His parents just couldn't contain his desire, so he went out into Norrath. Venturing West, through the commonlands and other areas, he eventually made it to the
vast plains of Karana. He had heard from other Humans and Half Elves of the city of Qeynos on the other side of Antonica and wished to get there. Roelan stayed with farmers on his journey, and had a run in with some Aviaks, but
finially made it to the West costal city. 
<P>Roelan kept journals of his travels. He is fascinated with the wonderful traveling bards that he's heard the great tales from and spoken with, he looked up to them, and envied their experience. From them he wished to do the same, and he is among the great tellers of lore in the League of Antonician Bards. Since then has written many of the great songs, and writes his own in the hopes that
young children like he was will hear and be excited about the world they live in</P></TD>
