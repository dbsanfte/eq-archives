<td><font color="#C0C0C0">The Southern Karanas is located below the Northern
Karanas and above Lake Rathetear.&nbsp; It is also linked to Splitpaw Lair.&nbsp;
From anyone coming from Qeynos, head to Qeynos Hills, West Karanas, North
Karanas, and finally South Karanas.&nbsp; If you are coming from Freeport
or Neriak, you can either take the northern or the southern route.&nbsp;
The northern route requires that you go through Highpass Hold, which can
get nasty as the city is a maze and they KOS most.&nbsp; Thus, I prefer
the southern route.&nbsp; Go to North Ro, <a href="oasis.html">Oasis of
Marr</a>, South Ro, Innothule Swamp, Feerott, Rathe Mountains, Lake Rathetear,
and finally South Karanas.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">As it is true with all Karana Plains, the South
Karanas is quite a large area.&nbsp; Characters from low to mid 10s and
upper 20s have plenty to kill here.&nbsp; The critter diversity is also
fairly large and you should have no problem finding something that fits
your taste.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Mid 10s characters can group to take out skeletons
in the undead graveyard, the lower level Aviaks in one of the Aviak villages
or Bird Houses (-6666&nbsp; +1000) as they so called, or the lower level
Centaur (such as Archers) among others.&nbsp; When fighting in the undead
cemetery, be careful with the NPC that sometimes spawn there called Lord
Grimrot.&nbsp; He is a level 40ish character that will likely kill you
in one shot.&nbsp; You should also be careful when hunting Aviaks as some
of these creatures are linked together and pulling one might result in
a train you may not be able to handle.&nbsp; As for the Centaurs, the only
advice I would give you is to watch out for Cyclops.&nbsp; Since you will
have to run all over the zone to find the Centaurs, you might meet with
the nasty Cyclops on your path.&nbsp; And he will not be interested in
chat and biscuits but will attack you on sight.&nbsp; Death will come quick
if that happens.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Upper 10s necros can still hunt the Aviaks or
the Centaurs, but you can start taking tougher opponents.&nbsp; A good
party should be able to handle the Aviak Harrier and most of the Centaurs
with easy.&nbsp; You can also hunt the Bull Elephants for the mammoth tusk,
which is worth around 8 plat.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">The Aviak level order is as follow, from easiest
to hardest:&nbsp; Egret, Rook, Harrier, and Avocet.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">The Centaur order is as follow, from easiest to
hardest: Foal, Archer, Courser, and Charger.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">As mentioned before, Aviaks are found in large
quantities in the Aviak village, but are also found wandering around the
South Karanas.&nbsp; Centaurs are found in the Centaur camp (+145&nbsp;
-2400), but you do not want to hunt there as too many Centaurs will kill
you very fast.&nbsp; Instead, stay in the area between the bridge to North
Karanas (+2400&nbsp; +900) and the Centaur camp as most Centaurs outside
their own camp can be often found wandering.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">It is for character in their 20s that I believe
the Southern Karanas really shines.&nbsp; You should now be able to handle
most things that spawn in this zone and can start having pay back on those
damn Cyclops that scared you so much in the past.&nbsp; A party of 3 necros
at level 24 can take down a Cyclops reasonably easy.&nbsp; Centaur Chargers
and Aviak Avocets are also not a problem.&nbsp; But my favorite target
in this zone are the Treants (+1500&nbsp; -3500).&nbsp; These immense trees
provide one of the best loot and XP in the game for mid 20s characters
and spawn so fast you might not be able to keep up with them. I believe
the main reason they are provide such great XP and loot is the fact that
they severely affect you faction standing in Qeynos.&nbsp; Most people
are not willing to take that hit but most necros are likely KOS in Qeynos
anyway and thus can hunt Treants without a problem (that is also the reason
why mostly evil races/classes hunt the Treants).&nbsp;&nbsp; I would recommend
a party of 4 low 20s necros when hunting them, or 2 necros level 24+.&nbsp;
Two Treants spawn at the same time about every 3 or 4 minutes (yes, that
fast).&nbsp; Spread you party far enough so the Area Effect spell the Treants
cast does not hit more than one person at the same time and target one
of the Treants.&nbsp; Once it is dead, move to the next treant and you
should be done quickly and safely.&nbsp; Be sure to check your pet's health
when you are done as two Treants casting AE spells on them will hurt quite
a bit.&nbsp; Also check to see if you don't have a DoT spell on you.&nbsp;
The Treant's Swarm spell deals 12 damage per round, no big deal but worth
checking.&nbsp; As a final note, if you are hunting the Treants and don't
think you are completely safe, have your highest level member fear one
of the Treants while you kill the second one.&nbsp; Handling one at a time
makes it a lot easier.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Remember that for any of the tougher kills (high
Centaurs, Cyclops, Treants, etc..) you should try to stay as far away from
battle as possible.&nbsp; That way you can let your pet tank the creature
and be in less danger of that creature turning upon one of your party members.&nbsp;
Thus, cast from a safe distance.&nbsp; Also be careful with Treants and
Centaurs as they are SoW'd creatures and will catch up with you in no time.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">If you are in a good level to solo some of the
Aviaks or Centaurs (level 24+ for for all besides Aviak Avocet and Centaur
Charger), the best strategy is to stand back, send your pet and cast DoTs.&nbsp;
Engulfind Darkness is vital here as you don't want the creature coming
your way too fast and you will want to fear it as soon as you are done
with DoTs.&nbsp; That way it will move away slowly and give you enough
time to cast some damage on it.&nbsp; Once you make it to level 30+ you
can start soloing Aviak Avocets and Centaur Chargers.&nbsp; Chargers are
harder to find since you have to wander around this very large area looking
for them.&nbsp; Avocets might be a little easier if the zone is not too
crowded.&nbsp; Around the Aviak city, there are quite a few spots where
Aviaks spawn.&nbsp; In each of these spots, any Aviak might spawn.&nbsp;
Thus, if you can kill an Egret (the lowest of all Aviaks but the fastest),
an Avocet may spawn in his place.&nbsp; You can also more safely pull from
the tree itself.&nbsp; Just go up and look for an Avocet.&nbsp; There are
a few ways you can pull one.&nbsp; The easiest is to have someone cast
Levitate on you so you can come down fast and safe.&nbsp; The other is
to pull and run downstairs, taking a few hits in the process (your pet
will not follow you upstairs).&nbsp; And finally, you can pull, cast Harmshield
and jump down.&nbsp; Just try them out and see which one works better.&nbsp;
SoW is also a tremendous help when soloing Aviaks, so try to get it if
you can.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">As a final comment, the South Karanas is not really
close to any cities or banks to be more specifically.&nbsp; Oggok is the
closest one but no necro with the exception of Dark Elves can safely wander
its streets.&nbsp; Thus, come prepared, with plenty of food and low on
weight or you will find yourself hungry and overweight in no time.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Like I mentioned before, I believe South Karanas
is an excellent hunting ground for necros in their 20s.&nbsp; Even though
lower level necros will find plenty to kill here, a party is almost always
required and XP will not be that great.&nbsp; There are better zones for
those characters such as <a href="lavastrm.html">Lavastorm</a> or <a href="wcommons.html">West
Commonlands</a>.&nbsp; But do pay a visit to South Karanas once you hit
the 20s and if you are willing to take the faction hit from killing Treants,
do try them.&nbsp; I gained three levels and more than 300 plat in less
than real life 20 hours simply by chopping trees.</font></td>

<p><b><font color="#FFFF99">Things you should know: </font></b><font color="#C0C0C0">There
is a Gypsy camp (-450&nbsp; 650) in the nearby Lake Rathetear (-8400&nbsp;
+1280) where you can buy food and water.&nbsp; Another interesting thing
is that killing either Aviaks or Centaurs does not affect your faction
standing with them or anybody else.&nbsp; Thus, you hunt them as much as
you want and still sell at the Centaur camp (+145&nbsp; -2400).&nbsp; Also,
killing Cyclops sometimes spawns a Sand Giant so be careful.&nbsp; Finally,
a reminder for those hunting the Treants.&nbsp; If you ever loot a Great
Staff from one of them, do not destroy it as it is worth 14 plat.&nbsp;
Quite a lot of money for a staff that doesn't do anything special.</font>
