<TD colspan="2">INFORMATION: Daedor's past is shrouded in mystery, some say he was a powerful monk in the old days, before adventurers were common, but was felled in a single battle with Mayong Mistmoore.  But he has 
been seen recently, moving silently through the streets of Qeynos.  If he is the same hero, he has since become darker, more ominous, and is rebuilding his power slowly, steadily.  Whatever the truth, Daedor is known to be
a selfless, bold adventurer, always there for his friends and those in need.</TD>
