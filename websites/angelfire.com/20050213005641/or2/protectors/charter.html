<img src="images/prot.gif" ALT="[protectors of the five]">
<br><br>
<img src="images/charterhead.gif">
<br><br><br>
<H3><Font color="Red">The Protectors of the Five were brought together long ago to protect five sacred virtues. We are protecting the need for TRUTH, HONOR, COURAGE, LOYALTY and JUSTICE in the World of Norrath. 
These are virtues many citizens of Norrath have shunned or forgotten, but we hope to rekindle the belief in them and make a difference in our world. We vow to set an example to those who have lost their way, those who have 
strayed from the path of light. The Protectors of the Five have learned through experience and understanding that all races can follow the Paths we adhere to. Your outward appearance is not the determining factor, it is the beliefs 
inside each which show the kind of person they are and actions which prove it. 
<P>Over time, the Protectors' ranks have changed and will continue to do so. Some have left us, but all have remained Protectors and friends. We have gained many new members and it is a common sight to see a group of 
Protectors wandering the countryside or some deep, dank dungeon. Do not be surprised if with your back to the wall, at your most desperate or in greatest need there will be a Protector nearby who will lend a hand without 
question or thought of reward.</P>
<P>Who knows what the future holds for the Five? What is certain is that our destiny and the destiny of Norrath is intertwined and the Paths we follow lead to a bright future.</P>  
<P>The Protectors of the Five were formed for two reasons: for a unified common understanding and desire for good and right action, and for a gathering of people who enjoy their play and to have a great time together.</font></h3></center>
<br><br>
<P>GUILD STRUCTURE
<P>The Protectors of the Five have a simple Guild structure, with a single High Guildmaster and five officers.  These officers each oversee and focus on a single virtue, be it Courage, Honor, Justice, Loyaly, or Truth.
Each officer has the responsibility to uphold and exemplify all these virtues, but to take a special focus on their Path, which leads them to guide and help their fellow guild members.  It is the privalege of the Path Leaders to invite new members 
into the guild, each new member choosing a particular virtue that they want to join under.  This Guild Officer then constructs a quest for that prospective member to join the guild under.  That officer also is responsible for overseeing the whole guild
and its behavior, making sure that his virtue is properly upheld and understood.  The Path Leader is responsible for helping any straying members to remember their virtues and to teach any guild member the meaning and worth of their
particular virtue. The officers also assist the High Guildmaster in his various tasks and responsibilities in overseeing and maintaining the guild.</P>
<br>
<P>GUILD MEMBERSHIP</P>
<P>Attempting to join the Protectors of the Five is as simple as letting a member know you want to join, but being accepted requires some assurance to the guild that you will be a good addition to us.  There are only two things you must remember 
when considering this guild, we are formed for the mutual fun of the game and for upholding the five virtues.  This is explained further below.  The process to join is simple, the Path leader will take suggestions from any player or his own consideration, and 
talk to that prospect personally.  If the guild, typically represented by the Officer, believe this person is the kind we want to have around, then the process begins.  The person wanting to join the guild chooses a virtue they will join under, and the Officer 
representing that virtue will give the person who wants to join a quest to complete before joining.  This quest can be as simple as crossing a dangerous area to slaying a horrid monster in need of being brought to justice, and varies by the virtue and the
Officer involved.  Once this quest is complete, the prospect is given a Probationary Membership, which lasts until the guild officer is satisfied that this member is comfortable with the guild's ideas and will be a welcome member.  When this probation ends,
the guild and the member are informed of their full status, and their name is moved from Probationary Membership on the guild list to full membership.</P>
