<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="3">The Plane of Growth, Tunare's plane:</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial">Why newbies entering it instead of fear or hate as thier
  first plane</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">As you all know that the plane of growth was
  released upon Velious release. Before this&nbsp; there were the planes of Hate
  and Fear. These planes were factionless hits and taught players on the ethics
  and style of a plane raid. Many great people like myself, Beld, Abad, Arith,
  Soulaw, Durron, Frieddman, even Sluggo, Isriam and many others of the old
  style on how to raid a plane and accept the reality of it. We did had a few
  whiners but at least we told em there was always a next time. During these
  time armor that was dropped there was very good. In fact it was the best of
  the best before Kunark was out and before Velious was released. Now Velious
  was released and it's being plauged by people who's expecting &quot;phat lewt&quot;
  and very inexperance at this raid. Also raiding Growth does come with a hugh
  minus.<br>
  <br>
  As you all now I have been thought over 100's of planes and done so much CR to
  get people and thier bodies out of the planes. Now today PoG is being raided
  by people who skips the old school planes just to get loot. If you want loot
  and want to learn about the planes do fear and hate. The plane of hate is the
  first plane unless your armor isn't there than do fear. Hate is like easy
  street to break while Fear is tough love. At least you learned about breaks
  and the CR factor. With PoG you go in invisable and pray some named or your
  invisable don't break. Once your in than mobs at 52 and above will come to
  you. This plane was ment for people around those levels and/or with planar
  experance not some newbie who just go into the plane just to get loot. The
  planes are ment to be a risk factor not some please give me some phat lewt so
  I can tell the next experance person I'm better than you are.</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">My problem is that inexperance people doing
  planes. To me if your doing a raid its' best you do the plane of fear and
  hate. Once your very good at it and/or have your armor collect than move onto
  the tougher ones. I believe it's disrespect when some SK with non-fear gear
  coming in, whining for loot and rubbing it in when he wins it. To me that SK
  just lost respect with many other old school shadow knights like myself. If
  people can't assist, can't stay where they are, pull when we doing CR instead
  of holding the fort til CR is done, whines, and many more negative stuff than
  they shouldn't be here in PoG instead Fear or Hate. The Plane of Growth is
  ment for those who knows thier stuff and yes knows how to do a planar raid not
  for some armor grubbin, greedy, loot mongral, jackass, inexperance newbie.</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;<br>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">Here is another thing about PoG I like. I am
  worshiping Innoruuk for my Shadow Knight. In fact I am a mortal enemy of
  Tunare. So naturally her believers invades Hate while Innoruuk's subjects
  invades Growth. With this there is a bunch of factional hits. With these hits
  the people of Tunare can do the quests that she and her loyal followers gives.
  It is natural for her followers to do these quests and get the armor. The
  problem is that some of the classes in the game following Tunare also have
  some mobs dropping thier stuff. The question for them remains should I kill a
  subject of Tunare just to get a piece of armor or quest for it. Well sadilly
  many high levels off these creatures just for a chance of armor. The sad part
  is that many of them taking the hits. Well four or so kills on a Tunarian
  creature your fate is sealed of not doing the quests. Verant did made a nice
  fix to the Cleric BP and many clerics of good aligned cleric now crying cuse
  of this. Well if Verant did made a quest for them to get it back it should be
  a long route but alas they are not. Instead these people have to suffer this
  choice of thier loot over thier god. When you make a choice you accept it's
  full responsiable of what to come. Like Growth once you do a night of it you
  got a long way to regain it back otherwise find another town to buy your
  spells.</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">Well in final Growth has factional hits, many
  inexperance people doing it and yes it's a fun place to get revenge on Tunare
  if your worshiping Innoruuk. Well that's it about my feel on Growth these
  days. So next time you want to do your first plane do fear and/or hate.</font>

<div>
  <font face="Lucida Calligraphy">Normally I do not post about Dragon Raids in
  word from the Shadow Lord but I must get this out. Tonight my friend Arith
  tactic got botched up by a group of people who didn't wanna listen and take
  risk. When you go on a dragon raid your risking your life and yes that thing
  called the exp bar to go left. The problem with todays Nagafen and Vox raids
  are people not taking one for the team and whining about loot. I have been on
  over 50 dragon raids. I have seen good ones where loot wasn't an issue and I
  have seen it where it takes more than an hour to lotto off the loot.<br>
  <br>
  <font size="3">When you do a Dragon raid prepare to die. When you do get
  invited to your first one by the Shadow Lord either you die with him or you
  get that dragon killed. Either way it's a fun experience and yes it's also an
  learning experience for future encounters more tougher than your average Old
  school dragons. As I said before Exp and Loot is just bonus when you go on a
  raid with me.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paladin book I don't normally whine about but lately some paladins I have
  seen aren't really paladins. I think those paladins should start making the
  Shadow Knight class. I have been on a few raids and yes one paladin got
  screwed out of the book defaulting to him cause he had other and I had to
  defend a paladin so she can get her book. The first paladin was forced to roll
  after Naggy dropped WHILE Vox was never killed for the paladin I have
  defended. So when you do enter a dragon raid my paladin mates think about that
  person who has one book and need the other. You'll make great friends and yes
  if he does return the favor it will be in your favor. If you do win a book
  from Vox or Naggy THAN you should get defaulted for the other book. I have met
  true paladins so far in the LSH and I am glad to call them Paladins. /salute
  to the LSH Paladins.</font></font>

</div>
<div>
  <font face="Lucida Calligraphy">My last rant about dragons is that when you
  kill a dragon your killing it for the glory of yourself. Yes I have killed
  many dragons myself for the glory of the LSH. The best two dragons I've killed
  is when Beld let a raid with a few LSH's involved and when Zalton was my 3rd
  man the one I lead the tactical run on. On Belds, Kryander before his problems
  happened won a nice druid stick. People did whine in my group but I told them
  he earned it. The second time I done naggy I was thanked in masses. The last
  raid I did I only got a few thanks but the rest carried about loot. My last
  words are that dragon raids are risky but they should be fun without the loot
  and greed factor.</font>
