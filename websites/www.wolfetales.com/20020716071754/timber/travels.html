<p><blockquote>Glad to see you back my friends. I was hoping I would not miss your visit. A little more 
of the story? But of course my friends. Let me sink my old bones into a chair with some tea and 
I'll continue. Ah, just a minute. Come here Laural and climb on papa's lap.

<p>Now where was I when last we met? Ah yes, the name. Well after the Lord of the Wood Elves 
named me and put me in the care of the shaman, I began to grow and learn the ways of being 
a wood elf. Believe it or not friends, their way was not much different than the wolf pack. 
They basked in the beauty of nature and the glory of the outdoors. No, not so different 
from the pack, for each bit they took from the great forest, they returned ten-fold. Take 
the wood from the great trees for fire and plant a small seedling to make up for it. Harvest 
the meat of an animal, but never more than was consumed. The hides, the bone, even the teeth; 
nothing was wasted, ever. 

<p>Before coming to the wood elves my language was that of the wolves. Soft whimpers, deep-throated howls, 
little yips of playfulness served well among my brothers. Under Pryo's charge I soon learned the language 
of the elves. For the first time, words came from my throat. A bit raspy to be sure, but actual words 
nevertheless. Ah, such a language, my friends. Never have you heard such beauty. More music than words it 
was, and I did struggle long to perfect the tongue Pryo taught. 

<p>''Ahnsteen abella longestee glee.'' It means good day, long life and happiness. Yes, I see you smile at 
the sound of it, my friends. Imagine my pure delight in knowing such beauty. 

<p>Once I learned language, Pryo set a bow in my hand and showed me how to launch an arrow straight and true. 
Well, Pryo's arrow soared straight and true. Mine clattered at my feet. A day it was before I could shoot it 
even a few feet in any peculiar direction it decided to go. Pryo, though was patient. Only telling me the same 
steps again and again and bidding me to continue. I did not learn the bow in a day or a week. Many, many months 
of practice stretched before me, and then I was only fair with it. Still Pryo urged and because I did respect 
and love him I did struggle. In time my diligence was rewarded. My hunting prowess was marked excellent by all, 
and I celebrated the honor of being known as the village's greatest archer. 

<p>When I reached a riper age, the shaman began a new course of teaching. Because he was my constant companion 
and teacher, I was privy to learning some of his mystic ways. He taught me the old arts of the Druids. As we 
walked along the paths of the deep forest he showed me the way to disappear among the very trees that surrounded 
us. Many a danger passed by as we stood silently and watched unnoticed. One day we came upon a bird injured in 
flight. I started forward to put an end to the poor, suffering creature. But Pryo stopped me with a slight touch 
on my shoulder. 

<p>''Nay, my son. There is a better way for this small creature of the gods.'' 
<p>Kneeling on one knee he took the tiny bird into his own strong hands. For a moment it struggled, 
frightened. Then softly he began to croon a peaceful chant. I watched as the bit of a thing relaxed and seemed to 
sleep. Pryo continued to stroke the bird gently for a time and I saw that the chest was still. 

<p>''Has it died then, Pryo?'' I asked 

<p>''Nay, my son. It does but sleep deeply.'' 

<p>While I watched the shaman fully extended the injured wing. A golden light seemed to surround him. He held 
the wing carefully and continued to croon softly. Finally, he folded it back against the side of the little bird. 
In a moment the golden light disappeared. Pryo placed the little bird in a bed of leaves and stepped away. 

<p>''Here, Timber. Come beside me lest we frighten her when she awakes.'' 

<p>I moved to his side, and Arrow hugged close up to me. Together we watched. Soon the small chest began to 
move. In a moment the bird was upright on tiny feet. The pain was gone from it and the wing was as before, 
strong and healthy. For a moment it preened and then, in the seconds before flight it sang out in the most 
beautiful song I have ever heard. It sang in thanks to Pryo. 

<p>''How can I learn of this special healing magic?'' I asked. 

<p>''I will teach thee, lad. 'Tis well to know the healing touch. I am proud you wish to study it.'' 

<p>And study I did until I could calm the forest creatures with my song and heal there tender wounds. When 
Pryo thought I was ready, he taught me to heal the elves as well. With word and touch, with magic and herbs, 
with the language of the old earth, I learned to heal. And so much more he taught me. I could hear the mystic 
words of the trees, slow and deep and, oh, so wise. I could tell from the song of birds where they had been and 
what they saw. The language of the animals was mine as had been the language of the wolves. But even these 
wonders were not all I learned from my teacher, shaman of the wood elves. By his side I learned to pull the 
very power from the earth, to control it and bend it and use it. I was not the best mind you but I had the 
drive to practice it at all times. And Pryo looked inside me. He told me of the future. 

<p>''One day, my son, you will know another with healing hands and magic to mirror your own. Together you will 
do much good against great odds.'' 

<p>''I do not understand.'' 

<p>''Tis not important that you understand now. You will travel many roads before that time.'' 

<p>''But how will I know him?'' 
<p>Pryo smiled then, that secret smile I saw sometimes upon his lips. 

<p>''Fear not, Timber. You will have no trouble recognizing the one who comes.'' 

<p>Soon after that I began to question my upbringing and where I came from. Obviously, I was not a wolf 
even though I was raised by them. I also knew I was not a wood elf. The shaman tried his best to explain 
my origins from what they learned of me with seers eyes. What they told me could not satisfy or still 
my mind. I had to know where I came from and who my people were. I sought an audience with the Lord of the 
village to ask him more. His trust in me had grown and he in fact had adopted me as his own, but he too knew 
I didn't belong in the village forever. He had an answer for me…one that would start a whole lifetime of 
adventures. 

<p>''I regret this time and have dreaded it, my son. I love you as my own and would keep you with me until 
the gods seek my spirit to walk with them. But you have learned well all of the lessons we can teach you. 
You are my pride, my own, as though it be my blood rushing in your veins. Were that it was. But your heart 
will never be stilled, never be eased when you think of your past. Not until you know about your parents and 
how you came to be among the wolves. You must leave the village and seek your own people. Travel to the farthest 
reaches of our world and claim the answers that rightfully belong to you, my son.'' 

<p>With that he embraced me tightly and then turned from me so that I would not see the sadness in his eyes. 

<p>''We are here, my son, among the trees. We are here and ever yours.'' 

<p>I gathered the few things that were mine. My redwood bow, my knife, various items for druidic spells and 
my friend, Arrow. We headed off into the great forest with little to guide us. Our only directions came 
from the shaman. 

<p>''Head in the direction moss grows for three days. Then look for the Mountains of Life. Follow the range 
till you come to a city. That is where your adventure begins my pupil.'' 

<p>''Thank you Pryo, but my adventure began the day you took me in and became my father.'' 

<p>Smiling broadly Pryo spoke with his musical voice as if the words he spoke this time were an unfinished symphony. 
"Yes Timber Wolf, you were my son for this short elven time. Please take care. Once you leave, we shall never 
meet again till the gods call upon our souls in the Valley." 

<p>''That is a long time away Pryo, will you still remember me?'' 

<p>''How could I ever forget?'' 

<p>I turned then with Arrow and started along the path. I could feel his warm gaze on my back. He would never 
forget me I knew, but I was saddened to leave the people I called family and the forest I called home.

<p>Arrow and I traveled as he said for three days and then on the horizon as the gods made them, the Mountains of Life 
unfolded in the east. We followed them another five days until we came upon the human city. Today would be another 
first, the first time Arrow and I ever saw the race known as human.

<p>Let me get you some more cider and then I'll tell you of the City of Light, the place where I started to pick up the scent of my true parents.
