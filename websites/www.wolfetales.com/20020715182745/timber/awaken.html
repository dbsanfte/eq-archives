<p><blockquote>The forest had adopted the child as if he were it's own. The wolves cared for the babe with 
tenderness and love. He was their cub as surely as if he were whelped by the alpha she-wolf. 
They nurtured him and taught him all a wolf needs to know to live. His senses surpassed anything 
that resembled human or elven for that matter. By the time the boy was the age of ten, he was a 
proud member of the Pack. He was also the pack's hunting leader. His keen senses allowed him to 
track anything living for miles, no matter how faint the scent. Now I tell you friends... When 
you can track a bird flying down wind of you on a rainy day, you are good. This boy was better.

<p>His curiosity and way of life led him to many different parts of the forest. Stealth and cunning 
kept him safe as he traveled beneath the deep green canopy of the mighty trees. And beside him, ever 
faithful, was his best friend, the she-wolf that grew up with him. They were inseparable.

<p>One day the two were scouting for a new hunting ground for the pack. Winter was close upon them 
and the deer in their current area were growing few. But this day would bring much more to the boy's 
eyes than a new hunting territory. All morning they traveled silently through the lush forest. The 
sun was nearing mid-day in the sky. The golden light filtered down through the dense growth to catch 
a spot here and turn the forest floor bright with color. The night mists had long since passed, and 
the day was unseasonably warm and humid. The boy and the wolf new it was time to seek a dark place 
to sleep away the rest of the daytime hours. Soon, soon, but curiosity turned them north into a denser 
part of the forest, a place even the wolves had never before explored. The she-wolf held back and the 
boy stopped to look at her. Silent forest lore passed between them. Yes, the part of the forest ahead 
was forbidden. None knew a reason, only that it had always been so. For a moment the boy nearly turned 
away. Still the only difference he could see about the trees ahead was that the growth was deeper, denser 
than the rest of the forest. Determined he walked on. The she-wolf paused still watchful. Finally, she 
followed him reluctantly.

<p>An hour later, the two stumbled across an area that seemed traveled by something larger than a pack 
of wolves, more like a pack of human-like creatures. Curiosity sparked in both boy and wolf and they 
pressed to track the creatures. What they found was a group of wood elves, or more aptly, the elves 
found them. Suddenly, they were surrounded by a number of tall, slender incredibly handsome hunters 
with long spears pointed in their direction. Wolf and boy froze, each protecting the back of the other. 
A low rumbling growl that seemed to go on forever issued from the heavy chest of the she-wolf. They knew 
they were hopelessly outnumbered.

<p>The wood elves were a solitary lot, preferring to be only with their own kind and shunning outsiders. 
They lived high in the forest trees in little huts built to blend with the foliage. Mobility kept them 
aloof from any other. Like forest nomads, they could never be found by humans....or other elves. The entire 
village could be packed up and moved quickly. So if any scout happened to stumble across them and live to 
tell of it, returning parties found nothing to prove the story. 

<p>Now mind you friends, the wood elves did not like to be found at all and when their watchmen noticed 
these two curious hunters, they were decidedly alarmed and called for elven guards to deal with the boy 
and wolf. But something in the eyes of the boy and the demeanor of the wolf stopped them from making a 
quick end to the situation. Instead, the guards brought the two before the village elder and shaman. 
With wide mystic eyes, the shaman looked the boy over and raised an eyebrow at what he saw.

<p>''This boy is a half-breed, Lord Domoit. He is not true elven nor is he true human.''

<p>The boy looked very confused as the shaman spoke. He had never heard words before. Only yips 
and growls from the pack. He reached for the shaman's mouth to see what was causing the noise. 
Instantly one of the guards stepped forward, his spear ready. But the shaman only waved him aside.

<p>''He must have been raised in the forest.... by the wolves, my Lord,'' said the shaman as 
he tried to hold the fingers of the boy and keep them from going into his mouth. ''He seems 
only curious about us and not a threat.''

<p>Lord Domoit rose from his chair, which acted as a 'portable throne' and walked over to the boy. 
''We have only two choices, Quareffi. We can dispatch his soul to the spirit of the winds or keep 
him with us. He cannot leave now. He may not be able to talk, but he can walk. I, for one, have 
had enough of killing and death in my lifetime.'' He paused a moment and then... ''Bring him into 
the village and teach him.'' He looked the boy's face over then met him eye to eye, almost as if 
to peer into his soul, Lord Domoit spoke to him. ''Do you have a name boy?'' scratching his hairless chin, 
''hmmm, I guess not since you were raised by wolves.'' Moving back to his chair he slipped into deep 
thought for a moment. 

<p>''As you wish my Lord. It has been a long time since I had a pupil to teach.'' Quareffi's lips 
curled into a smile at the thought.

<p>Lord Domoit looked quickly to the boy, ''but first a name.'' Squinting his eyes in thought he 
scanned the room for an idea. Finally, his face brightened and he leveled a gaze on the boy. 
''Timber Wolf. You shall be called Timber Wolf, named for the animals you call family. That way 
you will never forget them. And your friend here, she will be known as Arrow, for her courage and 
loyalty to you runs straight as an arrow's path. Yes, those are good names. Quareffi, make sure he learns them.''

<p>''Yes my Lord,'' said Quareffi bowing slightly to his liege.

<p>I guess by now, you have figured out who this boy is friends. Let me refresh my pipe here and I'll continue. 
<!Let me ask my wife to come over and meet you.>
