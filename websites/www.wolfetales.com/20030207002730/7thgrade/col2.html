Welcome to the Seventh Grade area of the Wolfe Tales Web Site<br><br></font>
 <font face="tahoma" size=3><b> Here you will find 
information to help you with your school assignments.  I am just getting started 
working on the site and it takes a little time to develop specific pages.  
For now you can view all of the notes for Social Studies, American History 
(Chapter 15, The Growing Crisis).
Later there will be some exercises that will help you study.  
In the future  I want to put your assignments online for you as well.  <br><br>
