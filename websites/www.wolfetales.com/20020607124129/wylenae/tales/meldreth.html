"Does I needs to be sayin the words for ya, m'lady?"

<p>"Nay, sir.  I know the way of words and can understand the scribe's marks."

<p>The little dwarf grimaced and turned to go.  From the thickness of 
the rolled parchment in her hand, Wylenae knew he must have toiled 
considerably to memorize the message so that he could repeat it all 
when he delivered the scroll.  Now any thought of receiving a token 
for his efforts seemed lost.  Poor little fellow, she thought and 
jingled two gold coins together in her hand.  Instantly, he turned 
back toward the open doorway.  His grizzled, old face beamed and his 
eyes held a merry light as she pressed the gold coins into his palm.

<p>"Thanks be to you, m'lady."

<p>"Safe journey, friend."

<p>He ambled into the shadows with a strange wobbling gate common among 
dwarves, and she closed the door lowering the crossbar.  She crossed 
the small room and gathered herself upon the softened gnoll hide before 
the open hearth.  The crackling fire warmed her.  In the light she 
examined the seal on the scroll preparing to open it.  The brittle 
wax bore Gandari's mark.   Suddenly, a chill washed over her.  She 
knew what a message from Gandari meant.

<p>Ever since the night she and Tymber took the fire emeralds and water 
goblin rings into Kithicor to give Gandari for the treasury, she knew 
the pact was made.  She remembered Tymber trying to refuse the gift of 
thanks Gandari proffered upon him.  Finally, he did agree giving Gandari 
the Ivy Runes from Redwing as well. 

<p>"I shall wear them proudly, my friend," he said, "and donned the Ivy 
Bracers presented to him.

<p>It was then, in whispered tones that Gandari asked if he could count 
on them in the battle against the evil consuming all the world.  And 
now here it was in her hand, like a summons to face danger, a message 
from Gandari calling them to fulfill the promise of that night.  Part 
of her wished she could fling the message into the fire and allow the 
flames to consume the thin parchment.  As quickly as the thought entered 
her mind, it was gone.  Honor would not allow her to conceal the message 
from Tymber, and the oath would not let her ignore the call.  She was 
turning the unopened scroll slowly in here hand when she heard the gentle 
music of Tymber's deep, low voice speak to her from across the room.

<p>"What is it love?  Who was that come to call in the dark of night?"  
<p>He roused from sleep and came to join her by the fire.

<p>"A dwarf messenger, my love."  She looked up at him slowly.  "He brings 
word from Gandari."  She raised her hand to give him the scroll.  As 
she did such a feeling came over her that her body trembled.  A memory, 
no not a memory, an image filled her mind.  What then what was it?   She 
saw a place so clearly she felt she had once been there.  A pool of sparkling 
water glistened in the sunlight wafting through the trees of the deep forest.  
A cottage built of hand-hewn logs sat between the giant old trees.  A human 
woman rested beside the pool watching a half-elven man add the last of the 
shakes to the roof.  She looked beyond and saw the place where the two of them 
had toiled for hours in the marsh cutting the reeds and tying them into bundles. 
She knew them so well, the man and woman.  She knew the woman's name though 
it was strange upon her tongue.    And then it was later in time with them 
and a tiny girl danced between them, her laughter like sunlight.  She took 
the book to her papa and he opened it slowly.  She crawled onto his lap her 
small thumb seeking her mouth.  He held her a moment, the closed book in his hands. 

<p>"Wylenae?   Wylenae what is it love?  Wylenae answer please?"

<p>The sound of Tymber's voice came through and instantly the image disappeared.  
She tried hard to remember the name that seemed so familiar minutes ago, but 
it was gone as well.

<p>"What?  Oh, nothing love.  I was only thinking of something," she answered.

<p>"Can you share it with me?"

<p>"Nay I cannot, Tymber for I cannot remember what it was.  Like waking with 
a dream in your head and moments later daylight steals it and what was vibrant 
and alive is no longer there."

<p>"I have had such moments of late, Wylenae.  Pictures come to my mind and then 
they are gone from me.  Yes, 'tis like a dream a bit."  Tymber took the scroll 
from her and broke the seal.  He unrolled it carefully and studied it a moment.  
Finally, he handed it back to her. 

<p>"Will you say the words for me my love?  The light is better where you sit I think."

<p>Again, the image of the quiet pool of bright water came to her, but she 
was saying the words of Gandari's message now and nothing else came to mind.

<p><i>My Friends,<br>
'Tis my hope the words here in find you well.  'Tis my hope that you are 
rested and strong for the mission I shall propose to thee.  Buried deep 
in the Steamfont Mountains, the land of the gnomes, lies a dark cavern.  
'Tis the home of the minotaurs, a frightfully evil place.  But, friends, 
as with all of Norath, evil was not always the way there.  Once the minotaurs 
were a peaceful race, a bit reclusive perhaps, but not bent upon murder as they 
are now. No all of that started with an evil gnome called Meldreth the Malignant.  
Never let his small size fool you.  Meldreth is deadly.  Once a strong magic user 
he was much revered by the gnomish community until he began to dabble in the black 
arts.  They consumed him and his soul turned as dark as the evil he practices.   
He dwells deep within the cave where none dare walk.  You see the minotaurs are 
his to command, his army if you will.  Some say they hate him but cannot 
break the grip he holds on their minds. Others say they are weak and were 
always turned toward darkness.  

<p>Of late Meldreth takes part in a deed we can no longer ignore.  You see 
many attempts are made to rid the world of him.  Brave people travel to 
Steamfont and seek him in the depths of the cavern.  Some are lucky enough 
to escape.  Others are trapped forever by his magic.  For he casts a spell 
that seals them inside the cavern.  Once captive, he starves them to death 
and as they die teases them with his most hideous magic.  And oh my friends 
I do so cringe at what I must tell you next.  He takes the heads from their 
bodies and preserves the brain within the skull.  In so doing they are never 
free to travel beyond this world to the mother.  Tunare, bless her, cannot 
intervene, and so he holds them captive forever.</i>  

<p><center>***</center>

<p>Wylenae looked up and shivered.

<p>"What is it?  What does she ask?"

<p>"She wants us to retrieve the sculls of three people he has recently murdered."

<p>"Does she have a plan?"

<p>"Nay, love, no plan.  And she warns the mission may be suicidal."

<p>A deadly silence fell over them.  Tymber sat near her by the fire.  The scroll 
slipped from her fingers and lay forgotten beside them.  For a long time 
they sat quietly gazing into the fire.  Finally, Wylenae touched his hand.

<p>"You are going aren't you?"

<p>"Yes," he whispered.

<p>"Then so am I."   

<p><center>***</center>

<p>In the morning they filled their packs with the items they thought they might 
need for the journey to Steamfont.  The trip would not take them long and so 
they would travel light, carrying only a bit of food and water.  Wylenae thought 
about the spells she would use and sat a while in meditation to be certain each 
one was mastered to the best of her ability.  Tymber filled his quiver with his 
best arrows and shouldered his bow.  Just as they were about to leave, someone 
called to them in a soft voice.

<p>"You shan't make the journey without me, my friends, " said Lady Syble.  "I too 
have word from Gandari.  She bade me seek you as soon as I could for there was a 
bit of information she forgot in her message to you."

<p>"What is that, m'lady?" Asked Tymber.

<p>"You can carry only one skull.  They are extremely heavy because of the 
awful magic Meldreth has cast upon them.  Thus, no one can carry more than 
one.  And one thing more, they are the skulls of rangers and only rangers 
may carry them away to Gandari."

<p>"Then what are we to do.  We are three souls willing, but I am not a ranger.  
If  'tis only the three of us one scull will surely be left behind," said Wylenae.

<p>"If I may, my friends, one awaits us there.  His name is odd to the 
tongue but you can get used to it in time.  He too, heard Gandari's call.  
His name is Jujumbwahh Asyatl."

<p>"How is it you know him, Syble?"  Said Tymber.

<p>"I fought with him once, my friends.  He is of a noble and honorable kind.  
Wylenae we will need your healing magic."

<p>"Aye, Wylenae my love, and when he feels the sting of your mind he will 
surely know he has failed this time at least.  Now make our feet as though 
we carried the speed of the wolves, and our hearts soar with their courage."

<p>No more than an hour's journey lay before them and they did run along at an 
energetic pace.  If the day were not filled with foreboding because of the 
trial ahead of them, all would find the warm sunshine a pleasant respite from 
Faydwer's soggy rainy season.  Instead, they were silent as they neared Steamfont.  
Each turned inward, prayerful and seeking the comfort of  Tunare.  Oddly, not one 
of them said a prayer for his own soul.  Instead, their devotions were for each other.  

<p>Just outside the Minotaur caves they paused to wait for Jujumbwahh and judge 
their surroundings.  There was plenty of open ground for the battle, nothing 
to fear as far as manuevering ability.  But by the gods, that cave did look dismal.  

<p>Finally, Jujumbwahh arrived.  They were ready.  Slowly they approached the 
opening of the cavern.  They knew one of them must go inside.  Meldreth was 
surrounded by guards.  Someone had to attract their attention and lure them 
from the cavern.    Before they could decide, a great wolf approached them.

<p>"Good day to you friends.  I am Whittle Briarbush.  Might I ask what you are 
doing outside the caverns?"

<p>Quickly they told him the evil tale.  Much to their pleasure, Whittle wanted 
to help them.

<p>"I do not wish to sound smug my friends, but my experience is vast.  
I have a better chance of entering the cavern and bringing out the guards 
than any of you.

<p>They watched in silence then as Whittle entered the cavern.  He disappeared 
into the darkness.  Long minutes passed.  Finally, they could here him coming.  
Such an awful screeching sound followed him that Wylenae cringed where she stood 
beside Tymber.  

<p>"It's coming," whispered Syble.  "It's coming."

<p>Whittle sped from the cavern and across the small expanse of open ground 
toward them.  In their midst he whirled and stood firm with them.  The 
pounding hooves of the minotaur crackled against the rocky cavern floor.  
Sparks of fire flew from beneath its feet and it came straight at them.  
Poised and ready all three ranger rushed the beast.  Their weapons pounding 
and slashing.  Wylenae healed them as they fought, and Whittle cast his mighty 
magic.  At last the creature began to fail. Within minutes it was done and the 
beast lay dead before them.  Tymber's sword dripped blood and his chest heaved 
from the exertion of battle.  Lady Syble was silent as she stood looking down 
at the creature.

<p>Whittle rested but a moment and then entered the cavern once more.  Again 
they were ready for the battle.  Again a minotaur lay before them dead.  
And now it was time for Meldreth.  His guards dead nothing stood between 
him and the little group who sought to free the souls held captive by his magic.

<p>"We will not be able to kill him," said Whittle.  "His soul will reenter the 
cavern.  There he will regenerate again and again.   But we will claim his body 
long enough to take the scull he carries.  He will have one and only one.  We 
will have to battle with him three time over to free those of which you speak."

<p>With that, Whittle cast his finest magic upon Syble and Tymber and they were 
as wolves.  Wylenae slipped into her wolven form almost without notice and 
stood beside them. And then Whittle turned and left them once again.  This 
time he would seek Meldreth and lure him from his rocky refuge.  The minutes 
stretched long, and Whittle did not come.  Silence surrounded them.  
The bodies of the dead minotaurs were a reminder of the evil they sought. 
Still whittle did not come.  The sun began to dip low in the sky and there 
was a chill in the air that spilled into their hearts.  Still Whittle did not come. 

<p>And then he was there.  Running from the cavern and behind him raced the gnome, 
Meldreth the Malignant.

<p>"How small he looks," thought Wylenae, but then his evil magic began to slash 
away at them and they were all fighting for their lives.  For a while it looked 
as though he would never fall.  Finally, he was down, but the hideous creature 
with him continued to pummel them.

<p>"God's what is that thing?"  Called Jujumbwahh.

<p>"'Tis the captive spirit of one you would save," said Whittle.  You must 
bring it low before his power over it shall end.

<p>"It's going to kill Tymber," Screamed Wylenae. She saw a huge gash open in 
Tymber's chest.  "No!  No!  Help him for Tunare's sake.  This cannot be."

<p>All were upon the captive soul, beating it down at last as Tymber slumped 
to his knees.  Instantly, Wylenae was beside him, healing him, stopping short 
the bleeding, easing his wounds.  She looked up at those gathered around them.  
She knew she did not have to say the words of thanks.  Her gratitude was 
clearly written in her eyes.

<p>"This one is for Tymber," said Lady Syble.  'Tis he who should carry the skull 
to Gandari and free the soul of the poor ranger.  

<p>Tymber limped slowly toward Meldreth's tiny body.  He knelt and searched 
the gnome carefully.  When he stood and turned to face them, in his hands 
he held a small skull.  

<p>"This ranger must have been a wood elf, " he said.  "A woman perhaps, judging 
from the size.  I am glad he owns her soul no more.  Gandari knows the way to 
send her on her journey to the Mother.  Once more she will walk in peace."

<p>Twice more they fought Meldreth and his guards, and twice more they won.  
No greater friends drew breath in Faydwer than the five of them that 
night as they sat to rest around a roaring fire.  Together they 
toasted the success of the battle, sipped brimming pints of warm honeyed wine 
and wondered what stories they would tell their children.
