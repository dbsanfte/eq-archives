may earn weapons, money, or armor, etc..  Quests are an excellent way 
to have active members and allow members to feel a part of the guild.


<p>Let us define quests as to how they relate to the guild verses the game quests. Quests 
as they pertain to the guild will be any event that a member undertakes outside 
of the norm that betters the guild as a whole. Quests will not be difficult or 
drawn out as they seem to be in the game.  However, neither will they  
be easy.  Quests will take a little time to complete.  

<p>An example of a guild quest for lower level characters might be to obtain 12 grey wolf hides. Doing so would help 
The character advances in level while completing the quest as well as aiding any
tailor in the guild. Thus, the guild is bettered by helping members to grow.  

<p>An example of a quest for a higher level character 
might be to assist a new player in reaching a certain level of experience.
Thus, the quest will work to prepare the higher level character 
for when they reach a rank of responsibility.  In addition, the new player will not become
discouraged with the game and will receive much needed practice and training.  

<p>Another quest maybe to go to Butcher Block Mountains and retrieve an 
item named in the quest. Thus, some quests maybe completed rather quickly 
while others may take a little time. The idea is to make each quest different and unique.  
Completion of two quests will be required to advance in the guild
or be considered for promotions.

<p>More about upcoming quests will be available as plans are formulated.
