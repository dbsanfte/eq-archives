<p>Evan 
was awake early in the morning.   She curled next to Timber her arm 
across his chest and took in the sweet smell of him as he slept.  
She watched the gentle flutter of his lashes as a dream filtered 
through his mind. She saw his lips curve into a soft smile.  Gently, 
she touched the turn of his lips with the tip of her finger.  A moment 
later she leaned up on one elbow to kiss him softly.  Her hand moved to 
trace the curve of his ear and along the outer edge to the soft point.  
She smiled thinking how she loved those elven ears.  In a moment she 
slipped from bed and pulled a warm robe around her. They would be on 
the trail at first light, and she wanted time to pack before Laural woke. 
	
<p>Silently she moved about gathering warm clothing and folding it 
carefully to slip into their packs.  There was no room for a horse 
on the narrow mountain trails and so they would have to carry all 
they needed.  Black Sky came to her and then pawed insistently at 
the door.  Evan turned to let her out.
	
<p>"I'll do it, love." she heard the rich warm tones of  Timber's 
voice behind her.  He embraced Evan for a moment and then went to 
let Black outside. "Not too far girl.  We will leave soon."  
	
<p>While Evan packed essential items and clothing, Timber 
went outside to the storage hut and gathered the trail items they 
would need.  A length of strong rope, a small ax, several large pieces 
of smooth waterproof leather,  numerous stakes, all went into the 
large pack.  Occasionally he hefted the pack and discarded one item 
in favor of another.  He thought of the mountain, and the snow.  
He included several soft fur hides.  They would need them before 
the trip was finished.  At last he was ready. 
	
<p>Inside the cottage Laural was awake and following Evan from 
room to room as she gathered items for the journey.  Evan sent her 
to fetch clean nappies.   She was eager to help, though by the time 
the nappies reached Evan they were no longer neatly folded.  Instead,  
they were a wadded bunch of soft linen cloth.  Nevertheless, Evan 
thanked her profusely, hugged her tight and kissed her baby cheeks.
	
<p>"Daddy is?"
 	
<p>"You are a daddy's girl, my little love.  Go and find him.  I 
think I heard him come in just now."  She  released Laural and watched 
her toddle off looking for Timber.  When she was out of sight, 
Evan folded the disarrayed nappies and packed them neatly.  Babies 
are wonderful people, she thought, and mine are sweeter than any.
	
<p>Half an hour later they were ready to go.  A warm breakfast of 
oats lay in their bellies.  It would carry them through the long 
morning on the trail and guard them against the cold.  Outside 
Timber stood in his fur parka and hood.  He wore his fur-lined boots.  
The huge pack he carried on his back made him appear to be anything 
but elven.   In fact, when Laural first saw him she hid for a moment 
behind Evan.  His reassuring voice soon had her clamoring for him to 
pick her up. 
	
<p>"No Laural, Daddy has too much to carry now," said Evan shouldering 
her own pack.  "Mama can carry you."
	
<p>"Nay, Love," said Timber swinging Laural into his arms.  "She is light 
as a feather.  I will carry her.  But that pack looks a bit much for you."
	
<p>"I'm fine.  It only looks bulky."
	
<p>Timber opened his parka and wrapped it around Laural.  She was already 
swathed in her own warm furs.  Now she would be equally protected on the 
mountain.  He tied the leather thong tight around them.  It would serve to 
support her and keep her safely close to him on the narrow trail.
	
<p>"How close can you get us to the opening, love?"
	
<p>"Two day's journey in winter weather.  The trail is too narrow anywhere 
else to risk anything closer."
	
<p>"Two days in the snow with my beautiful ladies?  I can think of 
nothing more wonderful."
	
<p>Evan smiled and reached to hold the black pearl in her hand.  Instantly 
a warm amber color grew from its center as she thought of the Mountains of 
the Moon.  She closed her eyes to block all other thought and concentrate 
on a flat wide space she knew at the base of the last rise to the cavern of 
the Mountain Wizard.  There would be one more place where they could take ease 
and rest on the climb upward, but it was too narrow to risk a portal entrance.  
There was always the slight distortion of time and space so that what appeared 
to be an exact location could actually be ten or fifteen feet in any given 
direction.  Still this place was safe, she knew.  She concentrated hard on the 
spot.  Finally, the golden light flooded the space around her hands and the 
pearl.  She whispered a tender prayer of thanks to Maya Taya and a wrinkle 
appeared in the space across the yard.  As the opening widened they could 
see a snowy expanse ahead. 
	
<p>"Wonderful, Evan.  It looks like the perfect place to enter."  
Timber smiled at her and with Laural in his arms stepped through the opening.  
	
<p>A moment later Evan followed.  Black was not to certain if she 
thought this plan was a good idea and whined a moment  stepping 
around in an agitated manner in the stable yard.
	
<p>"She doesn't want us to go, Timber,"  said Evan.  "Maybe we 
should not."
	
<p>"Nonsense, Love.  She is a worse worrier than you."  He turned 
to Black and whistled softly.  I need you now girl.  I need you to 
help me with this.  He knew the great wolf understood.  He knew she 
also understood his plan.  Still Black Sky paused a moment on the 
other side or the portal.  Timber whistled softly once again and 
she bounded through the opening knocking him backwards into the snow.  
	
<p>Timber's arms came up to shield Laural.  A moment later he was 
on his feet laughing.  
	
<p>"All right my sly one.  A little tussle is it."  He unstrapped 
Laural and stood her on her feet in the snow.  
	
<p>Hardly was Laural safely balanced on her baby legs than Black 
charged Timber once more and knocked him  to the ground.  She stood 
over him licking his face as he struggled to get away from her and stand 
once more with the heavy pack.  But Black would have none of it.  Each 
time he tried to rise, she merely hit him again knocking him back to the 
ground.  When she had tired him to the point of breathing hard from the 
exertion,  she made to cover him with snow, as though her task was 
finished.  All the while Evan laughed at the two of them.  The picture 
was so merry she could not help but laugh.  Black clearly had the upper 
hand and was enjoying herself.  Even Laural took advantage of the 
circumstance and plowed through the deep snow to land on top of Timber 
as well.  Finally, when it was apparent Black would not let him rise, he 
looked to Evan, his face the picture of mock surrender.
	
<p>"I could use a little help here, Love."
	
<p>"Oh,"  laughed Evan. "Really?"
	
<p>"Yes, my sweet lady wolf.  I admit it.  I have been bestead by a two 
year old little princess and a half crazed she wolf.  And now I must 
plead rescue by my beautiful wife."
	
<p>" I suppose I could call at least one of them off."  She snapped her 
fingers. "Here, Black Sky.  Come here girl."  
	
<p>The great wolf moved to her nuzzling her outstretched hand.
	
<p>"But I am afraid you will have to deal with Laural alone, " She smiled.
	
<p>"Let Daddy up, baby girl."  Timber put his arms around Laural and 
slowly moved to his knees.  "It's time we moved along.  Daddy has a 
special place for you to ride, princess."
	
<p>"Daddy carry."
	
<p>"Yes, my baby girl.  Daddy will carry you but in a special place to 
keep you warm and safe."  
	
<p>Laural's tiny baby arms came around his neck, and Timber held her 
close.  She giggled wildly and pushed against him once more knocking 
him back into the deep snow.
	
<p>"Seems I still have a small problem here, Love."
	
<p>Evan watched,  her heart swelling with love for them.  A picture 
of Tanis, so like his father came into her head.  She wondered what 
his children would be like.  How she longed to hold his babies in her 
arms.  The thought  made hot tears sting behind her lids and, she 
turned away blinking rapidly.  
	
<p>"In a moment, honey."  Her voice was no more than a whisper.
	
<p>Instantly Timber sensed the difference in her mood.  He set 
Laural on her feet and with no more than a glance at Black bid 
her watch the tiny little girl and keep her safe.  He stood up 
quickly going to Evan.
	
<p>"What is it, Love?"
	
<p>"Nothing, honey.  I just got to thinking, and I love you.  ...and 
I.... I love you is all."  She didn't want him to know that she was 
thinking of Tanis and Hope, wondering about their children.  She 
knew she would never see them.
	
<p>Timber took her in his arms holding her close against his chest.  
He did not need telepathy to know her thoughts.  He knew them as he 
knew the reason for being on the mountain in the snow.  Black Sky 
came to rub against them, offering comfort.  The demeanor of the 
great wolf was saddened as well. Never mind girl, thought Timber.  
We will save her.  We will because we must.  Still the wolf remained 
touching both of them, as though her tremenodus strength could protect 
them in spirit as well as body.  
	
<p>Laural pushed between them just then and Evan bent down to pick her up.  
	
<p>"I love you both so much," she said hugging Laural to her.
	
<p>"I want Daddy," said Laural squirming.
	
<p>"And he is yours my little one.  He is yours."  She looked up 
at Timber and lightly kissed him.  "Your daughter calls," Evan smiled.
	
<p>"I think I have a better place for you to ride little one," said Timber.	
	
<p>Timber swung the huge pack down from his back and tucked Laural in 
among the fur robes.  Carefully he secured a leather thong around her so 
that she could not fall out.  Then he swung the pack once more onto his back.
	
<p>"How is that sweet one?"  
	
<p>There was no reply.
	
<p>"She is fighting sleep, Love.  The cold has made her drowsy.  She will 
be safe and warm tucked among the furs," said Evan.
	
<p>"You  better lead the way, Evan.  Black go ahead of her to be sure the 
path is solid."
	
<p>"I'll be fine darling.  I have walked this path hundreds of times."
	
<p>"Go now, Black.  Find the trail and be careful with Evan.  She is 
the only wife I have."  He was silent a moment thinking of a talk they 
had once when Evan wanted him to promise he would not be alone when she 
was gone.  "The only wife I want, "  he whispered.

<p>Fleetingly,  he remebered a time far in the past.  A rage of flame, 
the scream ever embedded inside his head, a hideous roar and then the beating 
of wings as he raced to save her.  How he ached when she died, his love.  
His first love.  But the depth of it could never match his love for Evan. 
It burst from his chest and surged through him.  She was his very life.
All the he owned, would ever be was hers.   

<p>He shook himself slightly to push the secret back insdie him in the safe place
he kept guard over it.  Never did he want Evan to feel the pain of that day.
Only the joy of now and their life together was important.  Never would he 
forget that bright elven maiden, but she was part of yesterday.  Today and all 
of the times to come belonged to Evan and The children.

<p>Finally Evan did let Black go ahead, and soon they were climbing through 
the drifts of snow.  Black tested each step, her nose down.  
Occasionally, she looked back at them waiting to go on until they were 
safely across a particularly difficult area.  In some places the snow 
drifts  were so deep that they struck Evan mid thigh.  The going was a 
bit easier for Timber because of his height. It was not long before Evan's 
skirts were a sodden mass of clinging snow which weighted her down even more.    
Finally, she stopped and unfastened  the skirt.  She stepped out of it and 
stood in leather leggings.  She shook the heavy snow from the skirt and folded it.  
A moment later it disappeared inside her pack.  
	
<p>Without the weight of the long skirt Evan's movement was easier, and 
she climbed steadily up the narrow trail.  Ahead of them the great wolf 
broke the virgin snow and tested the trail carefully.  The exertion of 
the climb made talking difficult, and they settled into a silent, steady 
pace.  Evan could hear her own breathing and the sound of her step in the 
deep snow.  But the howling of the frigid wind blotted out anything else.  
From time to time she looked back at Timber to be certain he was safe.
	
<p>"You all right up there, Love?"  He called to her above the sound 
of the wind.
	
<p>"Yes, Honey.  I am fine.  Be careful now.  The trail will narrow again."
	
<p>Higher they climbed and the cold seemed to close more and more around 
them.  Beneath the deep snow the rocky surface of the mountain path was 
coated in several inches of ice.  There was no sure footing and twice 
Evan saw Black Sky slip and recover her step.   The trail was worse than 
Evan remembered from past years.  Was it worse really, she wondered,  or 
was it only that she was older and more cautious?  She did not know.  But 
Timber was with her and her baby girl, and they must remain safe at all costs.
	
<p>"Stay to the mountain wall," she called softly to Black Sky.
	
<p>Evan felt each step carefully before planting her foot solidly.  
Then suddenly her foot did slip and she was thrust back against the rocky wall.  
	
<p>"Evan?"  Timber called.
	
<p>"I'm fine.  But be careful here.  There are loose stones on the path."
	
<p>Timber moved Laural from his back and strapped her tightly to his chest 
so that he could put his back against the rock surface of the mountain.  
He knew he could shift his form and carry them forward with ease,  
a dragon... a griffin....  But, no,  not in front of Laural.  He gathered 
the parka more securely around her and looked into her sleeping face.  Good 
that she could sleep  like this and not know the peril of the trail.
