Our Pledge and Code</align="center">
</h4>
<h4><b><blockquote><blockquote>As anyone who has travelled the lands of Everquest these days knows it seems
that words like Honor, Trust, and Loyalty have all but lost their meaning within
the realms. But to a few these words are more than meaning. They are a way of life.
To those honorable people this guild is dedicated. We started out creating a guild whose members
live by these three simple words and have become a very close family. We all share
the same desire, to have fun honestly, to be truthful in all we do, and to be loyal
to our friends. We created a bond between us that is as close as a family.  We are
brothers and sisters. Because no bond is stronger than that of a family we strive always
with the well being of our family in mind. The only phrases that contain the word
"I" are "What can I do to help my brothers and sisters to make them
stronger?" and "What can I do to help my Family grow?"</B>
</h4>
<h4><h><i>Statement of Purpose<br><br></i>
The main purpose of the The Golden Blades is to establish a guild made up of members 
who are willing to work together in Truth, Honesty and Loyalty. By action and deed 
we demonstrate that these principles live on.
