<p>Timber watched her disappear, his hand absently stroking Black's soft fur. 
When she was gone he turned once more to the sound of the Mountain Wizard's 
voice.

<p>"What is it you wish, Timber Wolf."

<p>Suddenly, Timber dropped to his knees.  His voice was nearly a whisper.

<p>"I have come seeking your help.  Not for myself...  No... Wait...  
It is for myself.  For me and our children."  He fell silent suddenly, 
overcome with the emotion.

<p>"You have come because Evangileen is growing older."

<p>"Yes.  She ages before us and I am helpless to stop time from taking her from me."

<p>Timber felt strong hands on his shoulders bidding him to rise.  
He looked up and saw not the forbidding countenance of a great mage 
but the peaceful features of a kindly old man.

<p>"I have seen the signs as well and it pains my heart."

<p>"Then can you help me.  Take years from me and give them to her.  
But do not let time steal her from me."

<p>"I would not do that even if I could, my son.  She would never 
permit such a thing.  She loves you to deeply and to well to steal your life."

<p>"I would give them gladly to keep her with me.  My life is nothing without 
her.  What, then?  Are you saying there is no hope?"

<p>The Mountain Wizard stepped down from the dais to the cavern floor. 
Softly he called to Black Sky.  She moved away from Timber willingly.  
When she was beside him he stroked her soft fur and she whined softly.

<p>"Do you trust me Timber Wolf?"

<p>"Trust you?  I know Evan trusts you.  I know she loves you as a father."

<p>"And I love her as a daughter, but that s not what I asked.  
Do you trust me? Seek your heart for the answer.  Look within 
and do not answer rashly."

<p>Timber did think then.  He was not certain what answer was correct 
to give.  But it was not a correct answer the Wizard sought.  
Instead he knew it was the true answer.  What was the truth?   
Timber did trust Evan.  And Evan did tell him over and over that 
her teacher was a great and honorable man.  And today, when he held 
Laural, it was with gentle loving hands.  Yes, he could say it with 
out reservation.  

<p>"I do trust you."

<p>"Then watch and take great care not to interfere.  You have 
the power..." 

<p>He lowered to one knee and placed a hand firmly 
on Blacks muzzle. The other he held over her chest where he could 
feel her heart.  "You have the power within you to make the thing 
you desire most reality.  It comes from your deep love for Evangileen.  
She would not take years from you, Timber Wolf.  But you can add them 
to her with your love and the great power of Maya Taya and Paldinae.  
Now have faith and trust me.  What I do now will demand your trust."

<p>Suddenly, as Timber watched, Black sky's deep black fur began to fade 
and gray.  The shiny healthy glow disappeared as her coat dulled.  Her 
body lost muscle tone and the massive chest grew thinner.  Her eyes 
developed a milky haze and Timber knew she was blind.  When the old man 
took his hands away she slumped forward and lay still on the cavern floor.

<p>"Did you kill her?  Is she gone?"

<p>"Nay, my son.  She is merely very old now. "

<p>"Why?"  Timber looked at the mage confused. He hurried 
across the room to Black and the sight of her made tears 
stream down his cheeks.   "Why did you do this to her?  
Will it help Evan?"

<p>"No, Timber.  Nothing has changed for Evangileen.  But you 
are about to turn back time for Black Sky with your own hands.  
Do you love her?  If you do you can take the years from her.  
Time does not exist, Timber.  It is simply a tool contrived 
of man to measure events."

<p>"Tell me how, quickly.  Her breathing grows more shallow."

<p>"Will you believe in my words?"

<p>"Gods, yes!  Anything...  Tell me now, quickly."

<p>"Put your hands on her as you saw me do.  Concentrate only on her.  
Do not falter.  Think of your love for her and that which you want 
to happen.  If your heart is true she will come back to you."

<p>Timber placed his right hand around Black's muzzle.  He found the 
faint heart beat in her chest with the other.  Silently he sat eyes 
closed and thought of her.  All else he blotted from him.  He saw only 
Black and their years together. A golden glow grew from the palms of his 
hands and spread across Black Sky's body.  As Timber concentrated it grew 
in intensity.  He remembered ranging the forest with her beside him.  He 
remembered her loyalty.  He remembered he with her pups. Deeper into his 
mind now he saw her young and strong and healthy.  He felt her heart against 
his hand, first weak and then a steadily stronger pulsating beat.  He felt 
the muscle mass grow once more across her chest.  Then with out warning he 
was pushed to the ground and he opened his eyes startled.  Black stood over 
him licking his face wildly.  In a moment she stood away allowing him to rise.  
Timber sought the eyes of the Mountain Wizard.

<p>"She is young and healthy once more, Timber Wolf and the beauty of 
her life lies in your love for her."

<p>Timber looked at Black.

<p>"I did this?"

<p>The wizard nodded.

<p>"You did it with the love in your heart.  You can use that same 
love to help Evangileen.  But there is danger in what you do.  
If you falter in your concentration you can send her plummeting 
to oblivion.  Your love must flow to her without end through the 
golden light of Maya Taya and with the strength of Paldinae.  If 
you pause for even a second, she is lost."

<p>"But I am only an elf, m'lord, an elf of the forest.  How can I risk her?"

<p>"You risk nothing if you love her.  Nothing...  Only an elf you say?  
Look into my eyes, Timber Wolf and tell me what you see."

<p>Timber found his gaze drawn to the eyes of the Mountain Wizard.  
He saw beyond the surface to the heart of the man.  Finally he knew 
what Evan hinted to.  He knew the Mountain Wizard was himself, half-elven.

<p>"But what will I do for Evan, this way"

<p>"She will stop aging as she does now and year for year her age 
will match yours.  She will have elven longevity.  She will see 
your children grown.  She will remain beside you."

<p>"Will it change her as she is.  Will she still be human."

<p>"What is human?  What is elf?  One day the world will grow and 
learn that life and sharing are the riches, the gifts.  She will 
remain all that she is to you, Timber.  You take nothing from her.  
You give everything to her."

<p>"Will she live as long as I do?"

<p>"I cannot say her life will pass to the day as yours.  
But she will age at the same rate as you do.  Hence forth 
her years will be as elven years."

<p>"Then I am ready."

<p>Timber looked at Black Sky. 

<p>"Bring Evan to me, girl.  And stay with Laural."

<p>Black loped off through the passage to find Evan, and Timber turned 
once again to the Mountain Wizard.  

<p>"How can I repay you?"

<p>"No payment, Timber, only a favor.  When Laural grows a bit, I 
would be honored to teach her as I have Evangileen.  Bring her 
to me that I may show her the ways of the earth.  The magic of 
the world which lies in the trees and the water, the earth, the 
wind, the fire, I would have her know all of them as does Evangileen."

<p>"I will let her choose to come to you if she wishes.  My children 
must know the path they wish.  But if she desires the path you offer, 
I will bring her to you myself."

<p>"The words of a devoted father.  I respect them and would have 
thought less of you had you answered any other way.  Now seek 
Evangileen and, remember, do not let your concentration falter."

<p>The wizard raised his arm and a portal opened behind him.  He 
stepped through and a moment later the doorway closed. Timber 
was alone in the cavern.  He closed his eyes and took a deep 
breath.  Evan...  Evan...  He thought.  I will not fail you.  
He felt a soft touch on his shoulder and opened his eyes to 
find her beside him.

<p>"What is it Timber?"

<p>Timber slowly removed the Sword of Mars from his scabbard 
and placed it on the cavern floor.  He removed the scabbard 
and placed it nearby as well.  He shrugged off his wristbands 
and dropped them beside the scabbard.  He stood now in short 
sleeves and his trail leathers.  The holey stone hung at his 
throat and he felt its weight reminding him of the children 
and the day they presented the gift to him. The beautiful rich 
green of malachite pierced through with a perfectly round hole 
by the mother of all the earth was ever his comfort.  Eternal love 
from nature lived in the beauty of its green depths.   TO wear the 
stone linked him as one with the elements.  But now he must link 
his mind to only Evan.  He slipped the stone from his neck and put 
it on the floor as well.

<p>"What are you doing, Love?  What's wrong?  Where is the Wizard?"

<p>"Nothing is wrong, my lady Wolf."

<p>"Have you finished your audience with the wizard?"

<p>"Yes, I have love."


<p>"Timber, what is it?  You look a bit pale.  Are you?  Do you feel all right?"
"I am fine, my love."  He smiled to reassure her but knew she 
saw through the false face.

<p>"Timber what is it.  You are blocking me.  I can't see what's wrong."

<p>"I love you, Evan."

<p>He is so nervous and I can't see why, she thought.  How can he block 
me so completely.  His concentration is so great just now.

<p>"I love you, Timber."

<p>Slowly Timber leaned down to kiss her closing his eyes.

<p>"Please, Timber, what is it?"

<p>"Shhhh.  Just close your eyes and kiss me."  

<p>He put a hand on each side of her face turning it up to meet his.  
Slowly he lowered his lips to hers, kissing her softly.  

<p>I will love you forever, he thought.  A golden light spread 
through his fingers and washed over her cheeks.  He squeezed 
his eyes tighter together concentrating hard.  You are my life 
his mind told her.  Be with me always and ever.  Be with me until 
the end and beyond.  Be with me through eternity.  When we are but 
spirits on the wind, be with me.  Carry me as I carry you endlessly 
and forever.

<p>Evan felt a strange sensation washing over her as the kiss deepened and 
she melted against him.  She could feel the warmth growing from Timber's 
hands and spreading over her.  Images of the children and the cottage
flooded her mind.  ...pictures of them together in the forest, alone 
beneath the canopy of the great trees bathed in flickering sunlight.  
She felt washed in Timber's love, surrounded by it, protected by it.  
She saw their children, Laural grown... a young man beside her... a 
babe in her arms.  In an instant she knew the babe was her own 
grandchild.  In the next moment she gathered the baby to her and 
felt overwhelming joy burst forth in her heart.  And always beside 
her in every picture, every image was Timber. 

<p>Timber felt the warm light rushing from him into Evan.  
He saw each image that came to her.  He held her close in his 
embrace steadily kissing her.  He felt her weaken and knew that 
the light was at its peak.  She was his forever now.  Nothing 
would ever take them from each other.  They were one, more truly 
than ever, and the joy of holding her in his arms, loving her and 
spending all of his life with her was now complete.  He gathered 
her close into him while her body renewed, bathed in the magic 
light that was his love for her.

<p>At last he heard her sigh and looked down into her eyes.
 
<p>"I saw our grandchild.  Laural's baby."

<p>"Yes," Timber whispered,  "and you will."

<p>"But that is so many years away."

<p>"I asked the Wizard to help...  to help you live longer."

<p>"And he told you a way?"

<p>"I wanted to sacrifice some of mine to you, but he showed 
me another way."

<p>"Oh, my darling.  I would never take your years as my own.  
Don't you know that?"

<p>"I know, Evan.  And it did not happen.  He showed me another way."

<p>"You swear to me you have not given up life to me?  I could not 
live with that, Timber."

<p>He drew her tightly to his chest once more. 

<p>"Shush, Evan I swear it.  It is the new magic, the gift 
from Maya Taya and Paldinae.  He showed me how to use the 
golden light.  It was that, Evan, and the love I share with you."

<p>"Timber, the new magic is faith and no love is stronger than 
the love we share."

<p>"Evan, " he grabbed her suddenly up in his arms swinging her around.  
"You will see your grandchildren, all of them."

<p>She smiled down into his eyes settling her soft lips once more on his.  

<p>"I love you, Timber.  I will always love you."

<p>He smiled then against her mouth and kissed her deeply.

<p>"Let's go home," he whispered.   "Let's go home."
