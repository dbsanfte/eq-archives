<p>My name is TymberWolf (Half Elven) Spiritwood.  Yes, you are correct.  I am a half elf and, as required by law, 
the condition of my conception is forever a part of my name. A reflection of my shame you say?  
Nay, tis a banner I wear with pride.   For me to bow my head down in shame would scorn my own parentage.  
Ne're would such be possible.  In my veins runs the blood of two courageous people. Within their hearts 
was born the strength to spit in the eye of prejudice and find love.  If you have a few minutes I would 
like to tell you a tale. 

<p>Many moons ago, a child was born to a very courageous couple. The couple had known each other since 
childhood and were best of friends through out their lives. They lived, worked and fought alongside each 
other growing ever closer in feelings and love. During the last of the Great Dragon Wars the couple 
conceived a child out of wedlock. The mother of the child was of pure born royal elven blood and the 
father was one of a lesser elven blood. One that is not supposed to be seen with the royals. He was part 
elven and part human. The couple did not care. They were in love. They however, could not let this child 
grow up under these circumstances. He would be marred for life and driven insane by the prejudice against 
him. With heavy heart they decided to leave him with a friend. The nursemaid herself was to be the mother 
of the child and nurture him and teach him and never tell him of his parents.   She, however,  had other 
plans and was not about to be held down by this child's upbringing. The nursemaid decided to leave the 
child for dead in the middle of the forest. His parents would never know, no one would ever know. But some 
did know and some did care. The people of the forest looked upon the tiny child and saw the nursemaid 
abandon him.  Indeed, the wolves, the trees and every small animals saw and mourned the action. They watched 
and cursed the way for all time of the nursemaid for her corrupt heart.   They knew and despised the evil.  
None among them could tolerate such and act and the met and thought what to do.  The wolves being the pack 
and protectors of their own decided to take the cub in. Still with me friends? Good. Now the story begins.....
