<P><font face="tahoma" size=2> Web quests are a challenging and fun way for students
to participate in their own learning.  As we study history we often skip over some 
of the most interesting small details because we don't have enough time to include everything
in our studies.  Web quests are a way to learn a little more about particular parts of history that may interest us.

<P>This section of the web site reflects a selection of web quests designed by the 
seventh grade students.  Each student is represented by a pen name of choice and the 
title of their web quest.  Learning for this particular assignment is multi-faceted.  

<p>First, students learn first by designing a web quest for others.  Their page must include links to 
specific web sites that pertain to their topic, questions regarding information on the web site,
and instruction regarding completion of the quest questions and any other related assignment.

<p>Second, each student is required to choose two of the web quest each quarter and complete the assignments
for an extra credit grade.  Points will be determined as quest are developed.
