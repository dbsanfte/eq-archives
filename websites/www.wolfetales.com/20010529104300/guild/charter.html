<p><a name="q1"><u><b>Purpose of the Knighthood</u></b></a>

<p>The Golden Blades of Tunare champion the cause of justice and honor. 
These Knights follow a strict code of honor known as The Oath and The 
Measure, which they defend with their very lives.  A Golden Blade strives for 
peace and order at all times, never striking out in anger or hate.  The 
Golden Blades have come to Tunare to bring order and prosperity 
to the bleak realms.  As Knights we will aid any ally at any time and will 
fight evil at every chance.  The Knighthood is a non PvP Guild.  We do 
not start battles nor do we jump others of the realm.  We will only enter 
a non pvp battle when a cry for help is heard or permisson is given to enter.<br>

4) After "successful" completion of the officer candidate test ( which you will be sent to the Guild Master, Co-Guild Master and  Order Leader you will be inducted as an officer at the next guild meeting. *Note - We must have your completed test at least one week prior to the meeting or the promotion will be delayed until the following meeting.

<p><a name="q6"><u><b>Scheduled Meetings</b></u></a><br>

<p><a name="q7"><u><b>Amendments</b></u></a><br>
          Anyone having anything to do with the Knighthood may propose amendments. To do so, a letter must be sent via Email to the Knightly High Council of Justice. The Council will discuss the item and decide whether or not it will go to the all officers for vote. If the amendment is favorably accepted by the officers it shall be proposed at the general meeting.  There must be a majority rule for the amendment to pass.
<br>

<p><a name="q8"><u><b>Requirements and Restrictions</b></u></a><br>
          Golden Blades must be of good heart and behave so as well in the Realms of Everquest. A member may be of any race or class as long as they live by the Golden Blades Code of Conduct. Once a Squire becomes a Knight, when in public areas, such as the Halls and Taverns, that Knight will be addressed by his or her title. There are no exceptions to these rules.<br>

<p><a name="q9"><u><b>Disciplinary Procedures</b></u></a><br>
<li>Charges are brought to the attention of the Guild Master and Co-Guild Master. If the Guild Master and Co-Guild Master deem the charges an infraction of the charter, they are then passed to the Lady/Lord of the Crown. The Lady/Lord of the Order of the Crown shall meet with the High Prophet and Scepter Knight to inform them of the charge against the member and to form a Council made up of the three. The first order of business for the Council of the Crown will be to contact the person making the charge and advise them that they are not to discuss the issue with anyone.<br>
<li>The Council of the Crown shall call forth the member accused of the offense and formally present the charges to them. The accused must understand that no judgement either for or against is pending. They are called forward only to be informed that a charge is pending.<br>
<li>The accused shall be given 3 days to respond to the charges. The accused may request others to speak on their behalf. The Council of the Crown will then hear the defense of the accused and take one of two actions.<br>
<p>A.  The Council of the Crown shall inform the Council of Justice that the member is believed innocent and recommend that charges be dismissed.<br>
<p>B.  The council shall call forth the witness against the accused and seek further information. The compiled information shall be reviewed and the Crown shall render a decision based upon fact alone as to the guilt or innocence of the accused. That decision will be passed to the Council of Justice who will upon review render a final verdict. <br></li>
<br>
<u><b>General Principles</b></u><br>
Charges against members shall not be taken lightly
The council shall not meet to deliberate upon light matters of misbehavior. The problems should be of a persistent nature or so against the principles we hold dear that an investigation is warranted.<br>
There must be a preponderance of evidence to support action against any member. This is to avoid one member disliking another and attempting to discredit them and/or eject said member from the guild.<br>
A member is innocent until shown to be guilty<br>
<br>
<u><b>Penalties</b></u><br>
<li>First Offense (Warning) - The member receives a written warning from the Council of Justice stating the offense for which they are found guilty.<br>
<li>Second Offense (Probation) - The Council of Justice shall in writing sentence the member to a two-week probation. During the probation period the member is reduced in rank to recruit. At the end of the probationary period, the member may again rise to squire where a two-week period of training shall begin anew. Following the squire training the member may rise to knight status. Should the member be have in anyway unbecoming a Golden Blades, the third penalty shall be issued.<br>
<li>Third Offense (Immediate Ejection- the Guilds' Death Penalty) - The Council of Justice shall inform the member in writing that their membership in the Golden Blades guild is revoked. No recourse will be permitted. The Council of Justice shall resort to the third penalty only in extreme cases or in cases of repeated infraction.</li><br>
<br>
Be it known that prior to each offense in the warning system, the Council of the Order of the Crown (Lord/Lady of the Crown, the High Prophet and Scepter Knight) shall carry out the investigative process as described.<br>
<br>
<p><a name="q10"><u><b>Punishment for Dishonor</b></u></a><br>
If a member of the Knighthood is accused of a dishonorable action, the Lord/Lady Knight will hold a trial. The Lord/Lady Knight will be the judge, Lord/Lady of the Rose will be the defender and Lord/Lady of the Sword the prosecutor. The remaining Council of Justice will be the jury. If found guilty, the punishments will go as follows:<br>
     First offense -     Warning<br>
     Second offense -    Detainment and release of duties<br>
     Third offense -     Execution*<br>

<p><u><b>*Execution</b><br></u>
Upon execution, the person will never be allowed to return to the guild. Nor will they receive any help from any guild member, nor is any member to associate with an executed member. This is done for Guild security.<br>
