<p><font size=2>A day of thanksgiving is celebrated in many places around the world.  
However, Thanksgiving Day is a uniquely American Holiday.  
To most of us it means gathering with our families to enjoy a wonderful 
meal with tempting deserts.  It means Thanksgiving Day Parades and a rousing 
football game to watch on television while our noses are tempted with yummy smells 
from the kitchen.  Many of us attend services where church leaders meet as one to pray 
for peace and plenty in our land. Thanksgiving in America is a day for families 
and sharing, a day for remembering our many blessings,
