<p>Wylenae sat beside Tymberwolf in the quiet room.  The warm fire 
crackling nearby eased the tension from her as she softly hummed 
a sweet melody to lull him into sleep.  He turned over on the mat 
of soft hides and smiled at her once before closing his eyes.  A 
few moments later she heard his quiet breathing. 

<p>"At last," she thought.  "His wounds will not pain him in the 
land of dreams.  There Tunare's magic will protect him."  Her slender 
fingers brushed across his forehead and the furrowed worried look 
disappeared.  She sat long that night remembering the events of the journey.

<p><center>					****</center>
<p>The hour was late when they boarded the great ship StormBreaker and 
watched the deep emerald green of the Butcher Block Mountains disappear. 
Before long the horizon was only the meeting of sky and sea. Endless 
waves crashed against her bow as the ship plunged head long through the 
Ocean of Tears. They sat together on the deck as the fresh salt air of 
the sea washed over them. Wylenae put out her tongue tasting the salty 
spray. Tymber took her hand.   They did not speak.  There was no need.  
Each knew the thoughts of the other.  They were bound for Freeport and a 
journey into darkness.  

<p>Wylenae did not like Freeport, corrupt dirty place.  One could not 
trust the guards for many it seemed were an evil lot themselves.  
Still, the deed was ahead, and Freeport stood between them and the 
run for the Karana's.  She studied Tymber closely as he gazed out 
across the sea, and she knew he was thinking, planning how to proceed.  
Ever since he learned of the Short Sword of Morin he was intent upon the 
quest.  But Wylenae knew the sword was not the reason, no, not the sword, 
but the filthy thing who carried a certain document, the Ghoul Messenger.  
The document contained information that might, one-day ease the darkness 
and evil that filled Kithicor Forest, a document that Morin Shadowbane 
needed desperately. The more Morin could learn of the plotting and planning 
of the undead, the better the chance of freeing the old forest from the 
evil stench that held her. He always gave his special sword in thanks for 
any information the Ghoul Messenger carried.  


<p>And now as StormBreaker approached the Freeport dock, Wylenae knew that soon 
they would face almost certain death.   A week more, two perhaps and their 
skills might be honed sharply enough to stand a chance.  But the evil in Kithicor 
grew worse and Tymber was intent upon breaking the line of communication between 
the undead camps.  Because of her deep love for him, Wylenae would not consider 
Tymber going alone.  So in the end he gave up trying to talk her out of it.

<p>They left the ship in silence and hurried quickly through the streets of Freeport 
to the West Gate where they were to meet Sir Crystals, High Justice of the Rose.  
Sir Crystals would outfit Tymber with magic arrows to help him bring down the 
messenger.  They reached the West Gate without mishap and a short time later 
Sir Crystals arrived.  Warm greetings were shared all around.  Tymber had never 
met Crystals and many seasons had come and gone since Wylenae had seen him. When 
Sir Crystals learned of Tymber's intent to slay the Ghoul Messenger, he stepped forward.

<p>"I shall come with you, my friends.  If you will allow me, I will add my magic 
to that of Lady Wylenae and with your Ranger skill and strength we will bring 
the dark creature to its knees."

<p>"I would be proud to have you beside us."  Tymber smiled and gave Sir Crystals 
his hand.  When he accepted the offer a bit of the anxiety inside Wylenae eased.  
Crystals was highly skilled.  The odds of all of them surviving were now even.

<p>Tymber set out immediately leading them expertly across the plains of the Commons.   
Soon they would reach the entrance to Kithicor Forest.  Here and only here would 
Wylenae leave his side. She knew it was safer for him to run through the forest
alone.  She and Crystals would only slow him down.  It was but an hour until daylight 
and the time when the undead that roamed the old forest would hide away from the sun.   
They waited until the shadows of night disappeared and then Wylenae cast her finest 
magic over Tymber.  The magic would carry him swiftly to the other side with the heart 
of a wolf in his chest.  In a moment he disappeared, shrouded in his own magical 
camouflage.

<p>"I will see you on the other side, love.  Be safe," he whispered in the soft 
language shared only by the two of them.  And then he was gone into the silent 
forest where not even bird song broke the evil stillness. 

<p>"We must go, m'lady.  We must be there to meet him.  I shall find you at the druid 
circle and show you the way to the bridge."

<p>"Yes," said Wylenae.  "We must be there to greet him when he arrives.  He will 
arrive safely won't he, my friend?"

<p>"Of course he will," said Crystals.

<p>Wylenae waited a moment more.   "He knows I am thinking of him," she thought.  
"I could speak to his mind but I must not.  He needs all of his concentration 
and stamina for the run.  I must not distract him."  Finally she turned away from 
where the heavy growth of trees signaled the edge of the forest.

<p>"I shall meet you on the other side, Sir Crystals.   And thank you for coming 
with us."  She raised her arms to summon Tunare's hand.  "Take me Mother of 
All... Carry me to the Karana ring."  She felt the power of the Mother around 
her, lifting her, carrying her, spinning farther and farther across the land.  
Briefly she was mindless without vision or thought, and then gently Tunare brought 
her safely to ground.  Wylenae opened her eyes to the lands of North Karana.  
She whispered a quiet prayer of thanks to Tunare.

<p>Finally, the three of them were together once more.  Tymber stood quietly sensing 
the stillness around them, scenting the air and seeking with his mind the creature 
of darkness.  No one made a sound to break his concentration.  Instead, Wylenae 
and Crystals watched him intently.  And then with a burst of speed he began to run 
across the open plain.  

<p>"He has it," shouted Crystals and they were off to follow him as he tracked the 
Ghoul Messenger.

<p>They twisted and turned as they ran through the jagged hillocks.  All about them 
the creatures of the Karana's foraged across the immense grasslands.  On and on 
they ran. 

<p>"I can go no further.  I am spent.  My speed has washed from me," Crystals shouted 
on the wind.   

<p>For a moment, Wylenae thought Tymber had not heard, but then he abandoned the chase 
and returned to her side.  Together they searched until they found Crystals where 
he rested on the side of a hill.  Wylenae sent the magic of the wolf through him 
once more.  She coated his skin and Tymber's with steel to protect them and then 
paused in meditation to regain her power of life.  

<p>Her eyes were closed when the first blows began to fall.  At first she thought it 
was but a tremendous clap of thunder, so powerful was the force of it.  And then 
inside her head she heard Tymber's voice shout above the din.

<p>"Run!  The giant of the hills has us."  

<p>She came to her feet in time to see Sir Crystals turn to face the hill giant.  
His attack turned the giant away from them and onto himself.  The huge monster 
of a man rained blow after blow down upon Sir Crystals.  Wylenae saw him fall to 
the ground before her.  She knew she could not help him.  Alas, it was too late.  
The giant turned toward her as she began to run.  A solid blow caught her across 
the shoulders and pain seared through her.  She knew she could not turn to find 
Tymber.  She could only run as he told her.   Run and run and run from the certain 
death somewhere behind her.   At last she sensed the giant no longer and stopped.  
Tymber, she knew, was still alive and safe somewhere behind her.  But she could not 
sense Crystals.  She knew his act of valor bought the time for them to escape.  
Slowly she began to trace her steps back toward the place she last saw them.  
Finally, she heard Tymber whisper on the wind.    

<p>"I am safe for now, love.  My camouflage has made the giant blind to me.  But his 
concentration is strong and I may be revealed to him at any moment."

<p>"Thank Tunare.  I sense you there in the distance.  Where is Crystals."

<p>"At last I could not save him.  I fear he has perished," said Tymber.

<p>"No, wait.  I hear his spirit.  It speaks." 

<p>Crystals was not dead.  At the last moment his spirit fled his earthly body and 
returned to the place it called home.  Wylenae could sense him in the distance and 
Tymber set out to find him and bring him back to the place where she waited for them.

<p>Finally, all was restored to them and Tymber set out once more tracking the Ghoul 
Messenger.  False start after false start brought them up wanting time and again.  
But finally Tymber ran once more straight and true and they knew the messenger 
ran before him.  They crossed the open grasslands and ran on.  They approached 
the more rugged foothills and still Tymber ran.  At last they crested another hill 
and ran headlong down into the valley plain below.  

<p>Tymber pulled up short and raised his mighty bow.  Crystals stopped and prepared to 
cast.   The evil stench of rotting flesh filled them as the Ghoul Messenger stopped 
and turned.   Before Tymber could aim and loose a single arrow the evil thing cast 
its dark magic upon him.   Wylenae saw his feet sink into the ground nearly to the 
knee.  She knew he would not be able to move from the spot.  Hideous laughter surrounded 
them and the messenger moved upon Tymber, intent upon bludgeoning him to death.  
Bleeding from a dozen deep wounds, he was already losing ground.  
<p><center><img src="picts/ghoul.jpg"></center><br>

<p>"You shall not take him from me, evil cur," shouted Wylenae and cast a spell of 
healing over Tymber.  

<p>Near to her Crystals began his wondrous magic. Between them and the powerful blows 
from Tymber's weapons, the Ghoul began to falter.  Weaker and weaker it grew until 
at last it lay dead at Tymber's feet.  No one spoke as Tymber, bleeding from a dozen 
wounds, bent to examine the body.  He searched methodically.   Finally, he stood 
and looked at them.  

<p>"I have it," he whispered.  Morin Shadowbane shall know of the plot among them.  
We have broken the undead lines of communication.  It will be weeks before they 
can train another messenger.  Perhaps Morin can take what he learns from this and 
begin to salvage the beauty that was once Kithicor Forest."  Elated he grabbed 
Wylenae and began to dance with her across the soft waving grasses of the Karana Plain.

<p>They bid Crystals farewell and thanked him over and over for his aid.  A few minutes 
later they sought a quiet place near the druid ring to rest. Wylenae tended Tymber's 
wounds and brewed a healing drink.  She knew he wanted to set off for Morin with the 
message right away.  But not tonight, she was firmly resolved.  No, he must rest.  
Tomorrow would be plenty of time.
