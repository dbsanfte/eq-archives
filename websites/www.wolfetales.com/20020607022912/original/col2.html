<blockquote><font face="times new roman" size="4">Black Sky fiction is presented by the author who is a lover of
fantasy and the process of weaving a story that will touch your heart.  Margaret Elam was born in Michigan.  
When she was a little girl her family was always moving, across the country, across the state, across town.  In each setting 
she found secret friends who lived in closets, under porches, in the hollow of a tree, or beneath the cutbank of a woodland 
creek.  She always wrote stories about the pretend worlds she created.  

<p>The two people for whom she was named are dear to her 
heart.  Her great grandmother, Cornelia, whom everyone addressed as Neely, and her Auntie Margaret, known as Mae. 
Neither enjoyed the formal titles of their given names.  Nor does Margaret.  She has in fact, been Maggi for so 
many years that she often does not answer to her given name.  

Maggi is a graduate of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. 
She loves children, animals, and wondrous stories, and tales.  

 

<p>She still lives in Ohio with her family.
