<p>"I am mightily proud of the guild, Frost," said Onoralea as she 
moved about the guild hall.  "And, dear wolf, I am mightily proud 
of thee.  Since you have come to walk among men, you are learning much."

<p>In wood elf form, Wylenae was small.  Standing beside Onoralea, she 
was half her height in fact.  Now, she sat quietly in front of the 
huge open hearth and dozed a bit as she watched Onoralea toil away 
with a scroll in preparation for an upcoming guild meeting.  
Finally, relaxed, she stretched and curled into her body.  Her 
image blurred and faded.  When Onoralea looked toward the hearth, 
the delicate form of the little wood elf was gone.  Instead, a great 
white wolf slept comfortably.

<p>Alone in the silence of her own mind, Onoralea wandered away from 
the lands of Tunare.  The image of hills and gentle flowing rivers 
turned golden in the afternoon sunlight filled her.  Farther and 
farther, across oceans and seas of time she drifted.  Her hand went 
to her throat and she held tight to the moonstone that rested there.    

<p>"My teacher, where are you," she called softly.  And then she felt the 
old wizards mind touch hers, link to her thoughts.  She opened wide the 
depths of her knowledge so that he might see all that she knew of Tunare.  
He walked the shadowy corridor of mental images.  He saw bloody battles 
and triumphant victories.

<p>Suddenly, Onoralea felt a jolt.    She could not describe exactly the 
way the old elf's mind linked and jerked within her own.  She knew only 
that there was a mistake, and the error was her fault.  Something she 
did was going to go incredibly wrong if it was not resolved soon.  
Before she could probe to find the answers a wrinkle appeared across 
the room form her.  The edge of the opening flickered in the firelight 
and an instant later Melindarius Lunalight was facing her.   The old 
wizard stood straight and tall as always.  Instantly, Onoralea went 
to him and knelt.  

<p>"My teacher, what is it?  What have I done?  I displease thee in some 
way.  I feel it in your mind and see it now in the continence of your 
face.  How have I erred?"

<p>"Rise up my child," Melindarius extended his hand to her.  "You have 
not displeased me with thy deeds.   But, there is a mistake you must 
correct, 'tis true.  'Tis Frost, dear girl.  Frost must at once be 
returned to wolven form permanently."

<p>"But he was so lonely, my teacher."  Onoralea looked at Frost still 
peacefully asleep.  He hears us not, she thought, and then remembered 
they were speaking inside their minds.

<p>"Indeed, I am sure he was lonely.  Tell me though, my child.  What form 
did you find Frost to be when he was wolven no more?"

<p>"Why, he was a wood elf.  But the spell I know turned him to a female 
wood elf.  I do not know the counterpart."

<p>"Onoralea, Onoralea," Melindarius shook his head.  "The fault here 
is mine to bear, my dear.  Ne're did I think your lessons would be cut 
short from me as they were.  There is only one spell, Onoralea.  You 
did not know another because there is none other to know."

<p>"Then what, my teacher, what is it that has you so disturbed?"

<p>"'Tis, for Frost I come, child.  Should the spell remain longer, 
Frost will be forever female, a female wolf as well as a wood elf 
woman.  The forest cannot be cheated, Onoralea.  And nature cannot 
be made to see the two as one.  Therefore, the magic of the Earth 
Mother will adapt to what we have done.  You must change Frost 
back now, tonight."

<p>Suddenly, there was a low growl behind them. A deep mournful cry 
echoed through the chambers of the guild.  An instant later Wylenae 
was standing there beside them.  Tears streamed down her cheeks, 
and she rushed for the comfort of Onoralea's arms around her.

<p>"Change me back?  How can I go back?  I am the sum of both worlds now.  
I cannot leave the world of man and those things I have learned so far 
exceed the lore that was once mine.  Change me back?  Nay please do not, 
Onoralea.  I pray, thee. Leave me as I am."

<p>"But Wylenae, do you understand what the change means to you?  Do you 
understand that one day soon when you seek your wolven form that form 
will no longer be male?"

<p>Wylenae looked first at Onoralea and then straight into the eyes  of Melindarius.

<p>"I understand.  I knew always of the way of the Mother.  I choose 
now for the spell to remain no matter the consequence.  In truth 
my life is more full than one might ever wish.  One has come, Onoralea, 
a soul, sent by the Mother, to share my heart."  Wylenae looked pleadingly 
at Onoralea, but it was Melindarius who spoke softly to her.

<p>"Your path is your own Shadowfrost.  I asked your father one day a 
long while back to bring his best to me as a companion for Onoralea.  
'Twas you he did bring to me.  His choice was right and true.    
Be it now as you wish.  You will be blessed in truth as I see it now.  
The long years of elves shall be thy gift and the loyalty and cunning 
of the wolf as well."

<p>Melindarius turned then to Onoralea.

<p>"It seems child, 'tis I who erred.  You did but follow the heart, 
as is well of a DreamDancer.  All is well my child.  All is well."
