Welcome to the Eighth Grade area of the Wolfe Tales Web Site<br><br></font>
 <font face="tahoma" size=3><b> Here you will find 
information to help you with your school assignments.  I am just getting started 
working on the site and it takes a little time to develop specific pages.  
For now you can view all of the notes for Chapter Two, Foundations of American Government.
  
In the future  I want to put your assignments online for you as well.  <br><br>
