<p align="justify">Once long ago in a far place a half elf roamed the forest.  His name was Tymberwolf. 
Shunned by both elf and human for his elfkin herritage, he was abandoned among the ferocious beasts of the forest 
while still a mere babe in swadling.  But this half-elven child was special and when the beast drew near 
they sensed a glowing aura which surrounded him.  So strong was his essence that not a single animal dared harm the babe. 
Still he was subject to the elements.  Night came and the temperature fell.  The ground turned cold 
and the babe whimpered and began to cry.  

<p>Just outside the small clearing where he lay, they began to gather.  First one and then another they came 
and sat and raised their soft muzzles to the night sky scenting the infant.  Like ghostly shadows they moved into position 
guarding, watching, waiting.  So still they sat, like sentinels of the night, wolfen brothers and sisters come to seek
the babe.  And then from deeper in the shadows, he came.  His coat was silver in the moonlight and his eyes golden.  
He was fully twice as large as the others and a strength of presence exuded the fluid movement of his lean body.  
He was Sky, the alpha wolf, the leader.  Beside him, a bit slighter in build but still of significant 
size stood his life's mate. She was called, Black. Together they stepped into the clearing and moved toward the babe.  

<p>Yes, he was the one.

<p><p>Far away  a man named Marcus, the captain of the guard of a small nation led his men along a treacherous mountain path.  
For hours they trudged along  beaten by wind and snow.  The path lay at the very edge of their realm and the party patrolled here checking 
for intruders.  Rounding a sharp curve in the path, Marcus pulled up short.  Ahead and slightly above him on an outcropping of rock stood a wolf.

<p><blockquote>"Stand steady, fellows," he called out to the men.</blockquote>

<p>None behind him could see the wolf.  The turn was too sharp.  Perhaps he should back track.  He eyed the wolf, careful not to make direct 
eye contact and threaten the beast.  It was a big fellow, probably a male by the sheer size of him.  Its fur was silvery white and the coat was thick and full.  
Perfect camouflage, thought Marcus.  If the snow had not stopped a while back he would have missed it completely.  The wolf remained as still as the rocky 
edifice upon which it stood and cocked its head to one side,listening .  The change in stance was enough for Marcus to observe 
something else on the ledge beside it, a little girl.  She was no more than two or three seasons.  She was dressed in home spun like that of the country 
people though the weave was unlike any Marcus knew locally.  Her feet were wrapped in rags and her little arms were bare.  Her hair was a tangle of 
dark curling locks.  
She looked toward Marcus then, and he could see her little cheeks were tear-stained.  Something swept deep into the core of him when he saw her face.  
Something so incredibly bittersweet that he knew he could not pass from the mountain without the child safe in his care.  By the gods, those little bare arms, 
she must be so cold, a wonder she was alive.

<p>But the wolf...

<p>Marcus did not know how to reach her with the wolf so near.  Obviously, it was protecting her.  Legends spoke of children raised by wolves.  
He shook his head.  More stories, more tales, he thought.  Where was his logic?  Slowly so that he would not alarm the wolf, he dismounted.  He eased forward 
along the path until he was near up to the wolf and the little girl.  Still the wolf eyed him.  What was it he knew of animals?  Present calm and peace 
before them and they will trust.  He tried to project just that presence before the white wolf as he continued to move ever closer.  A deep rumbling 
growl halted him.  He stood there for a long time waiting before he tried again.  He heard a raw threatening snarl.  By his own sweet arse he could not see a way to reach that child?  Nothing for it then he supposed.  He would have to kill the wolf.  He drew the bow 
from his shoulder and an arrow from his quiver.  At such close range he could not miss, must not miss.  He placed the arrow and drew it back against his 
cheek holding steady.  No good to rush now.  His arrow must fly true and straight through the heart.  He took in his breath and closed his eyes 
for a minute against the wind that made them tear an blur.  When he opened them once more the wolf was gone.

<p><p> He turned from the crystal to face the slight figure beside him. She waited hoping that all was complete.  
She knew he was exhausted with the efforts of the day.  So hard... All so very hard...  But the time was right for
them. 

<p><blockquote>"They come sister.  They walk the same earth."

<p> How can you know they will meet, my brother?."

<p>"They can do no other. Destiny names their paths now through all of time."

<p>"Will they know?"

<p>"Aye, in time I suspect they will know."
<p>...and so it came to pass that through time over many worlds they traveled.  
Indeed it was true as Melandarius decreed.  Always they would knew each other.
