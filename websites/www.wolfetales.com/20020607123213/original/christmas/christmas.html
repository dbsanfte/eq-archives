			<font face=times new roman size=4><p>Girlhood chums and more,<br>
			That was Ruthie and I.<br>
			She was younger.<br>
			I was older,<br>
			Just a year between.<br>
			I walked with her to kindergarten.<br>
			Her little fingers clung to mine.<br>					
			She smiled sweet for high-placed friends.<br>
			I was in first grade.<br>

			<p>Her father died of cancer<br> 
			When we were eleven and twelve.<br>
			She cried and I felt guilty<br>
			For a sadness I didn't share.<br>
			In high school they expelled us<br>
			For smoking in the Johnny.<br>
			Ruthie was embarrassed.<br>
			I didn't have a care.<br>
			Ruthie was an honor student.<br>
			I made D's in Health.<br>
			Ruthie went to college.<br>
			New York for me and work.<br>
			
			<p>Ruthie came East to visit<br>
			And stayed all summer long.<br>
			She met a West Virginia bum<br>
			In front of the U N,<br>
			I tried like hell to stop her,<br>
			But she up and married him.<br>
			She and the bum moved in with me<br>
			'Til they could find their own place.<br>
			Six months later they were still there.<br>
			The bum got fired<br>
			Because he was drunk on the job.<br>
			Ruthie got pregnant<br>
			Because she forgot the pill.<br>
			I moved to Indianapolis<br>
			Because I couldn't kill the bum.<br>

			<p>I started writing ads<br>
			For a local Indy paper.<br>
			Ruthie wrote she'd lost the baby.<br>
			The bum called to borrow money.<br>
			I hung up on him.<br>
			The bum went to prison<br> 
			For screwing up a robbery.<br> 
			Ruthie divorced him and felt like a failure.<br>
			I went home for Christmas that year.<br>
			Ruthie was staying with her mother.<br>
			Her mother was remarried<br>
			That very Christmas Eve.<br>
			I went home to Indy,<br>
			And Ruthie went with me.<br>

			<p>I was promoted to writing<br>
			The Entertainment page.<br>
			Ruthie found a job in credit<br>
			At a big department store.<br>
			My press pass got us in<br>
			To all the fancy shows.<br>
			Ruthie's fifteen percent discount<br>
			Saved us money at Sears.<br>
			One week we were broke<br>
			And ate popcorn 'til pay day.<br>
			We spent a lot of time laughing.<br>

			<p>Our apartment had one bedroom.<br>
			We sold my double and bought twins.<br>
			I worked late three nights a week.<br>
			Ruthie started sleeping around.<br>
			She brought her paramours home.<br>
			I grew stiff and crinkled<br>
			From sleeping on the couch.<br>
			Ruthie huddled with her current love<br>
			All warm and snug and cozy.<br>
			I was fed-up and tired.<br>
			Ruthie was happy and satiated.<br>
			I doused them in ice-water<br>
			One night at the midnight hour.<br>
			Ruthie was mad as hell. <br>
			I laughed like the devil.<br>
			Ruthie slept out after that.<br>

			<p>Ruthie was a Baptist<br>
			When she cared to be.<br>
			I wasn't much of anything<br>
			But times felt good and full.<br>
			I met a Jew in springtime<br>
			Who looked Errol Flynn.<br>
			We rode his motorcycle to Canada<br>
			And lived three weeks in a tent.<br>
			We made mad passion in the woods,<br>
			And life was glorious.<br>
			Ruthie said I'd go to Hell<br>
			For sleeping with a Jew.<br>
			I told her he was worth it.<br>
	
			<p>The Jew talked of marriage,<br>
			And we made plans.<br>
			Ruthie got religion<br>
			But not in the sack.<br>
			I bought a wedding dress<br>
			And met his mother.<br>
			She sided with Ruthie<br>
			And condemned us to the fire.<br>
			I didn't care.<br>
			My Jew didn't either.<br>

			<p>A week before the wedding,<br>
			The Jew was mugged and died.<br>
			I sat and held his hand<br>
			Until he closed his eyes.<br>
			His family held a service.<br>
			They asked me not to come.<br>
			I cried a bit because of that.<br>
			Ruthie never left my side.<br>

			<p>Ruthie met a good man<br>
			But didn't fall in love.<br>
			I fell in love and married<br>
			Ruthie's good man.<br>
			Ruthie moved to San Francisco<br>
			And lived with an Indian.<br>
			I wrote and said she'd go to Hell<br>
			For fooling with a heathen.<br>
			Ruthie said she couldn't get to Hell<br>
			By way of San Francisco.<br>

			<p>The good man bought a house for me.<br>
			Ruthie married the heathen.<br>
			My father died the following year,<br>
			And Ruthie lost her mother.<br>
			Two years went by.<br>
			I didn't write.<br>
			Ruthie didn't either.<br>
			Then Christmas came and I got her card.<br>
			I smiled when I saw she'd signed the thing,<br>
			"Ruthie and that old Heathen."<br>

			<p>Ruthie had children.<br>
			So did I.<br>
			We checked in each Christmas.<br>
			The years went by, and our kids grew up<br>
			But never saw each other.<br>
			My youngest daughter asked one day,<br>
			"Who's Ruthie and that old Heathen?"<br>
			I smiled and told her, "Mother's Friends,"<br>
			But it didn't seem to matter.<br>

			<p>The words grew fewer on those cards.<br>
			My kids were married and gone.<br>
			And finally that good man and I<br>
			Were living all alone.<br>
			We sold the house and bought a dog.<br>
			We traveled off to Europe.<br>
			We were always home by Christmas,<br>
			And the card was always there.<br>
			We got older.<br>
			My hair went gray<br>.
			That good man lost his.<br>
			He retired.<br>
			I joined a club.<br>
			And then that Christmas came.<br>

			<p>The card was ten or so days late<br>
			When I saw it in the mail.<br>
			I slit the envelope apart<br>
			And looked inside the page.<br>
			No letter bringing Yuletide cheer<br>
			Accompanied the card.<br>
			`CHRISTMAS GREETINGS' read the print,<br>
			And then below he'd signed,<br>

			<p>"Just me now, that old Heathen."<br>
				
			<p>Our Ruthie'd gone to Hell.<br><br>
