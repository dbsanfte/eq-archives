<p>"Frost, how many days hast thee endured with this thorn 
so deep in the pad of thy paw."

<p>Onoralea sat cross-legged on a bed of soft pine needles 
beneath one of the brave old grandfathers that graced the 
normally scraggly growth at the timberline.  Today she was 
not the Paladin of the Golden Blades.  Gone were her sword 
and her armor.  She was dressed in the old way, the way of 
the forest.  The fabric of her tunic was of a coarse weave 
that came to mid thigh. That and her rawhide leggings were 
a warm rich tan color.  The boots she normally wore were 
replaced by leather sandals, which were laced nearly to her 
knee.   She was only the DreamDancer come to find her friend 
and tell him the tales of the land below.  

<p>She could hear the gentle language of the old tree as the wind 
rustled through the strong branches. The low boughs made a canopy 
of sorts against the endless chill and blowing winds whipping 
through the high peaks.  The Butcher Block Mountains were 
beautiful to behold but all too dangerous to the unwary.  
Frost sat oh so still as Onoralea tested the proud flesh 
around the thorn gently.  A soft whine escaped him and 
he licked her hand.

<p>"I am so sorry old friend.  I know no other way but to pull 
it out and the pain of it will be great.  Already it festers 
with poison. But perhaps I could just..." 

<p>She let the white wolf rest for a moment and stroked his ears 
scratching gently behind them in the spot she knew he loved 
best.  Frost rested his head in her lap and closed his eyes.  
A few moments later Onor began to croon to him.  The sweet 
song was not made up of words exactly, nor was it simply a 
hum.  No, the sounds Frost understood so well were soft comforting 
wolf sounds.  

<p>A bit longer Onor talked to him in the musical language, and 
he traveled out of his pain and onto a path deep in a forest 
forever sealed tight in his memory.  Sunlight wafted though 
the dense leaves overhead and played in tiny patterns across 
the forest floor.  Frost leaped and bounded after the bright 
patches as if he were a cub once more playing at games of chase 
the tail and nip your brother.  Soft growls came from his deep 
chest as he remembered the feel of cold water rushing around his 
strong legs when he bounded through a flowing stream.

<p>And then the thorn was gone and Onoralea squeezed the last of the 
yellowish discharge from the wound until healthy red blood appeared.  
She tore a strip of clean linen from the chemise she wore beneath 
her tunic and wrapped Frost's paw carefully.  Softly she called to him.  

<p>"All over now, Frost.  Awaken.  The pain will plague thee no more."

<p>Frost opened his eyes and looked at Onor and then down at his paw 
as if surprised that the pain was indeed gone.  He settled more 
comfortably beside her, ready to hear another of the stories he 
knew Onor would have to tell him.

<p>Onoralea sat for a while in silence.  She was not reluctant to 
talk about her life below with Frost.  No indeed she wished to 
share those times with the great wolf.  But today, just now, she 
sensed such unrest within him.  She felt the sadness of loneliness.  
Wolves were social creatures, Onoralea knew.  They traveled in packs 
and stayed close to each other always.   But Frost?   Frost gave all 
of that up to guide and protect me.  And now he is here 
alone on a mountaintop and sees little of me, she thought. Onoralea 
was afraid with all of the new guild duties she assumed as Guild Leader 
of the Golden Blades since Lord Jarreil left them, she would find even 
less time to journey up the mountain. Something had to be done.  Finally, 
after a long while she sighed deeply and seemed resigned.  
Frost's ears perked up at the sound. 
 
<p>"Frost, what if you could take the form of an elf, a wood elf perhaps?  
You would still feel comfortable among the trees and none would find it 
odd for you to spend so much of your time outdoors.  You could come down 
from the mountain with me if you walked on two legs."

<p>Frost's tail began to thump and he whimpered happily. 

<p>"There is only one problem my friend.  I learned the magic to change 
your shape, but my lessons were not complete when we left the old world 
and traveled here.  I do not know exactly what will happen. "  She 
looked at him a moment and shook her head.  

<p>"No, I think perhaps I should not try this, Frost."

<p>He sat before her dejected, his head bent low.  A soft whine escaped 
him, and he nosed his muzzle under her hand.  Onoralea looked down at 
him and lifted his head so that she could see his eyes.   Soft brown 
pools of innocent devotion met her gaze.  She saw the loneliness so 
clearly etched in his gaze.  But beyond that she saw trust and faith.
"Then you want me to try?"  She whispered.

<p>He was immediately on his feet beside her wagging his tail.

<p>"Very well, but we must prepare."

<p>Onoralea rose and gathered as many twigs as she could find for the 
small fire she would build.  The short clumpy fox grass that grew so 
high up made up for the lack of wood.  She dug a small hole and laid 
the materials for her fire carefully.  Then she stood and took a small 
dagger from her belt.  She drew a circle on the ground all around 
the shallow fire pit.  Inside the circle there was only enough room for the
two of them.

<p>"Come," she called softly.  

<p>Frost moved into the circle and sat across the way from her.  Onoralea 
knelt by the fire pit and took the moonstone, which hung around her neck 
and held it tightly in her hands.   She closed her eyes and thought of 
the heat of the fire.  She saw the flames lick up and begin to devour 
the fox grass.  She saw the sparse branches ignite and the fresh licks 
of flame that warmed them slightly.  Still she sat silently concentrating.  
And then she could see Frost, the deep golden flecks that swam in the dark 
brown eyes, the soft silver fur that glistened in the clear light from the 
fire.  She saw the willowy body of a wood elf superimposed across the image 
in her mind that was Frost.  She saw the figure curl and fold in upon the 
great wolf, melting into him and stretching out again.  She heard the creak 
of bone transforming and heard a soft whine.

<p>"Bright flame,<br> 
Dark Earth,<br>
Sky and Sea and Wind,<br>
I call to thee.<br>
Let the force of Tunare and Maya Taya<br>
Grant our humble request."<br>

<p>Still she did not move and the moonstone was like fire in her hands.  Finally, 
she began to weave in exhaustion.  From above a bright flash of lightening 
etched across the sky.  The long spear shattered into a million flickering 
bits of light raining down upon them.  Onoralea opened her eyes.  Sitting 
across from her within the circle was the delicate form of a wood elf.  

<p>"Frost?"  She whispered.

<p>The small elf looked at her and in a voice a bit ragged with newness replied,  
"Yes, it is I."

<p>The magic worked.  Frost was safe. All was well accept for one small 
thing.  Onoralea's magic had turned the great wolf into a small wood 
elf girl. 

<p>"Oh Frost I am sorry.  I know not how to change you to a man in this form."

<p>Still Frost was happy in the new body and moved around bending and runing. 
He especially liked the freedom of being able to grasp objects in his hands 
and lift them close to examine them.  So many wondrous new ways to try out in this form.

<p>You must be careful still, Frost.   At odd times you will take 
your wolven form.  In a bit you will recognize the feeling that 
comes before you shift.  Whenever you want you can revert to that 
form and leave this one.  I can change you back.  I did learn that 
part of the magic completely.  Until then you control when you 
are wolf and when you are elf.

<p>Frost continued to dance about trying out the elven body.  Finally 
he turned to Onoralea.

<p>" I can come down to the world of men beside you now?"

<p>"Yes, Frost.  We can be close now once more."

<p>"I will need a name won't I?  I could take the name of my mother.  
I would be happy for that dear Onoralea.  And it would not seem odd 
to the ears of men."

<p>Frost moved closer to her.  Onoralea could smell the fresh 
outside forest smell on her skin.  She could see her old friend 
deep in the warm eyes that looked into her own.  Suddenly, she 
embraced her.

<p>"What was her name, Frost."

<p>"Wylenae." whispered Frost.   "Her name was Wylenae."
