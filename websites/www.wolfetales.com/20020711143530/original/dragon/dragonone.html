Forgotten.  Like dried leaves scattered against the wind they drifted through endless days and dark, secret nights where only memories served to comfort.  Sullivan could see into the common room from the place he waited. They were hard to look at.  Why?  Was it sympathy?  Yes, he supposed so.  But more than that he realized it was fear, fear of one day being like them.  He wondered now if coming was the right choice, but Maarit was not like them.
<p>He tried not to stare but couldn't seem to stop. He supposed it must be something like the compulsion that made a driver search to see the bloody victim amid the mangled, smoking wreckage of a roadway accident.  Sullivan sighed.  They were the victims here--the victims of life.
<p>The look of them fascinated him.  Some of them sat slumped sideways in their chairs and seemed for the world as though they might topple to the floor.  Others were tied upright their heads lolling, traces of drool streaking their chins in crazy patterns.  One old fellow worked diligently to scoot his chair across the room toward a tiny white-haired woman in a pink duster.  His pants were a wadded mess at his ankles, and his bony legs looked stiff and arthritic.  His old legs were not the only stiff part of him.
<p> "Nurse, nurse.  He's got his socks off again."
<p>Sullivan was impressed that the old man could get it up.  He must be ninety or near there by the look of him.  Yes, he thought.  He certainly does have his socks off again, horny old bastard.  And, you my dear old thing, will be the recipient of his attention if he can manage to get across the room before that nursey you call to so plaintively comes to save you.
<p> "Maarit?  So you come to see our Miss Maarit, our mystery lady?"
<p>Sullivan stood up as a rotund aide shuffled toward him.
<p> "Oops, scuse me just a sec."  She marched into the common room and straight to Mr. Socksoff.  "Now, Nathan, you know you ain't supposed to go messin' with Miss Lucy."  She grasped his chair from behind, swiveled it around and moved him as far across the room as she could.  "There now, we'll fix them pants later."
<p>Sullivan could only watch as the old boy stretched and strained to turn the chair around and start the journey all over again.  He looked at Miss Lucy.  Her head was slumped forward now.  Her chin rested against her chest and her eyes were closed.  She was the Energizer Bunny, thought Sullivan, finally caught and skinned.  When do you wake up again, Miss Lucy, when Nathan Socksoff gets his chair turned around?  
<p> "Sorry `bout that," said the aide coming back to him.  "I'll tend him soon as I can.  Aint never enough hands here.  We aint like those fancy, private homes where they got an aide for every patient almost.  State don't pay for that kinda care.  By the way, call me Eugenia."   She started down the narrow corridor, and Sullivan fell in behind her.
<p> "You from the newspaper?  Ain't no one comes to see Miss Maarit `but one time a year.  Them folks from the paper comes and takes her picture and puts it in the paper.  Miss Maarit don't like it.  Mostly won't talk to them none.  They been tryin for a spell to find someone who knows her ever since her files burnt up with them other peoples.  Got all them sorted out.  Only Miss Maarit they don't know nothin' about.  One fella couple years back called us up first to see had we figured it all out yet.  Said he didn't want to waste time comin' if she were dead or somethin'.  Bastid... I'da liked to told him so, too.  Now that last little girl who come, Laurel somethin' her name was.  Miss Maarit seemed to take to her.  Talked and talked like I aint never seen before.  And I'll be damned if she didn't tell her the wildest story.  Somethin' `bout a man named Michael Wolf."
<p>They came to a narrow stairway and Eugenia started down the steps ahead of Sullivan a thin sheen of sweat making her black skin glow from the exertion.   
<p> "So you aint from the papers, you say.  Well, that makes it special nice you come to see Miss Maarit then.  She aint got no one.  Least no one comes.  Then course if someone did they might a got her all figured out again.  Most of `em ain't got no one."
<p> "Well, no.  I am not from the papers.  But I didn't tell you that," said Sullivan.
<p> "Guess you didn't.  Sorry.  Just get used to talkin' and answerin' around here.  Most of 'em won't answer you.  Them that does, says some nonsense don't mean nothin'.  Now Miss Maarit, I thought she was different.  See, we got us two kinds of peoples here.  We got us the loonies and then we got the sensies."
<p> "Loonies and sensies?" 
<p> "Yep.  The sensies, well they is just plain old or maybe they got them somethin else like a busted up body don't work no more.  Nothin wrong with their thinkin.  Clear as you and me.  Some of em's able to do for theirselves even.   Any how that's one kind.  But lord-a-mighty, them loonies," Eugenia shook her head.  "Them loonies don't know nothin bout where they is no more.  Mostly they sit and stare or babble some.  Talk to people ain't even there."
<p> "Like the man upstairs you mean?" said Sullivan.
Eugenia nodded.
<p> "Then we got them do have their minds clear, the sensies.  Miss Maarit, now I thought she was one of them even though they got her locked up in here. We all guessed she was here cause she aint got no memories cept talkin some 'bout her baby what aint no more.  You ask me it's a cryin shame.  I never knowed she was one of the loonies, too.  Turns out she's one of them special kinda loonies.  Fools you for a long spell.  Always seemed jest fine when I talked to her.  But then that girl come, and she told her `bout someone she called Michael Wolf and a bunch of magic stuff.  That was when I knew she musta gone over or always been that way."
<p>They reached the bottom of the stairwell and turned down another long corridor that led past the laundry and the kitchen.  A little farther on they came to another stairwell.
<p> "Becareful a this one.  The steps is real steep," said Eugenia.  "How's come then?"
<p> "How's come?"
<p> "Yeah.  Why you here to see Miss Maarit?"
<p> "I came because I read the article in the paper"
<p>Eugenia stopped half way down the stairs and turned.  "You ain't believin' that nonsense?"
<p> "I just want to talk to her," said Sullivan.  "The story intrigued me.  I'm a writer, you see."
<p> "A writer?  You mean like books and such?'
<p> "Yes," smiled Sullivan.  "Like books and such.  I write fantasy stories."
<p> "Make believe and magic stuff.  I don't hold too much with that.  But now them love stories.  I like them sometimes. ...like the juicy parts mostly.  But magic stuff...?  Can't see what folks sees in it."
<p> "I just want to talk to Maarit and hear her story for myself."
<p> "You thinkin to write it all down?  You thinkin to make one of them fantastic stories out of it.  Well, I doubt she'd be tellin' it to you knowin you think it's a made up story.  Still nice you come to see her."
<p>Eugenia reached the final step and turned left down another long corridor.  Sullivan could hear her huffing and puffing from the exertion of walking and talking at the same time as she moved her ponderous body along.
<p> "Why is she all the way down here?" Asked Sullivan.
<p> "You'll see in a minute.  Ain't so bad as it seems.  I kinda like it myself.  She won't stay no other place and most of us don't mind the break walkin down here away from the rest to tend her."
<p> "Tend her?  Is there something... I mean how old is she?"
<p> "Miss Maarit ain't one of the old folks, mister.  She do walk with a cane but that come before she was here.  Don't know just why.  Asked her what she wanted it for one time and she said she liked the way it looked.  Then she showed me how the handle was carved all fancy and the like.  And she sings sometimes.  Got an old guitar."
<p> "I got the feeling she was still a young woman when I read the article in the newspaper," said Sullivan.
<p> "Yeah, I just mean we gotta bring her meals separate and tend her room.  Mostly she tends her own-self.  Here now, look at this. You must a read `bout this, too.  She started it a long time back.  Reckon 'bout three years or so now."
<p>Suddenly, the institutional gray walls disappeared, and Sullivan was in the middle of a forest, alive with color.  The walls on both sides of the hallway were covered with brightly painted trees.  Everywhere, splashes of color hinted at an abundance of wild flowers.  The faces of small animals peered from high in the treetops or from the tender velvety grasses.  Here and there the eyes that looked out seemed to blink and gaze intently into his.
<p> "This is beautiful," said Sullivan.  "What I read in the newspaper didn't come close to describing it.  Why wasn't it ever mentioned before this year?"
<p> "Well, I guess they didn't know nothin `bout it `til that girl come.  Miss Maarit always come upstairs to see them news people.  Didn't never want `em in her private place.  But that girl she brung down here.  Brung her down to show her.  She said it was the place she had to get to.  Walk on up this way.  She done painted more."
<p> "I feel as though I have stepped into some other world.   The trees...  God, look at the leaves.  I can almost see them move," said Sullivan.
<p> "Some says that.  I heard the doctors say how peculiar like it makes `em to come down here.  And Miss Maarit, she don't say nothin `bout it 'til that girl come.  Just smiled and said she made pictures of a place she liked."
<p>Sullivan slowed and touched the painted bark of one of the trees.   He knew it was only a bit of paint and a flat surface, but it looked so real.  He half expected to feel the rough texture of an old tree beneath his fingers.
<p> "Her heart is in the paintings."
<p> "Well, don't know `bout that.  Some thinks maybe she were one of them artist types got stoned on drugs or somethin.  She don't say nothin' `bout who she is or where she come from.  Acts like she don't remember.  Always did act like she didn't remember.  See when them state records burned up in a fire over to the other building, best I can say is Miss Maarit's past burned right up with em.  Story is she had her a man, but I ain't seen no signs a nobody."
<p> "Didn't she help them.  I mean she must at least know her own name."
<p> "Course she do.  Least I thought she did, till she told that story to that newspaper girl and I figured out she was a loony.  So maybe she don't know.  Anyway, she never would tell them nothin bout herself after that, and them who was here and who might a knowed is gone. People comes and goes here real fast cept us aides and cleanin folk. Doctor's what comes is only kinda puttin in their time here I guess when they first gets started.  See we got so many resies they don't never remember no names.  No one never come looking for her.  No kin nor nothin.    She were a home patient anyhow."
<p> "What's a home patient?"  Asked Sullivan.
<p>Eugenia pulled herself up short and stopped.  She rested her bulk against the painted wall.  Sullivan smiled.  She looked for all the world as though she was leaning against the giant tree painted there.
<p> "I don't rightly get how this works.  But home patients is those the home takes care of for what time they got on this earth.  Happens a bunch a ways.  Some got no money.  Some gives they money over.  Gives em a place to spend their days.  Some the court sends and some is just wanderin' loonies got sent here some time or other." 
<p> "And there is nothing anywhere to say who she is."
Eugenia started walking again.  "Not as any of us knows.  Maybe some one way up could find it out if they took the time to look.  But seems the lookin' ain't worth the cost of the time to do it.  Don't worry Miss Maarit none."
<p> "That's why you call her Maarit Mystery."
<p> "Guess that was in the paper, too"
<p> "Yes."
<p> "I gotta get back upstairs.  You can look at them pictures long as you like.  When you want, just follow your nose.  She's in the old sunroom what looks out on the woods and crick.  That's the place she took for her own."</font>
