<p>"Timber,  the worst spot is ahead.  It is but a few inches wide.  
You will have to hug the mountain.  There will be no room for the pack."  
Evan called to Timber across the wind.

<p>"We can take care of the packs,  Love.  Don't worry.  We can transfer 
the packs across with a rope.  Just be careful, " he shouted back to her.

<p>Evan and Black reached the narrow ledge.  It curved around the rock 
face of the mountain.  She knew that once she and Black were on the other 
side, she would no longer be able to see Timber.  She did not like the 
idea of him being cut off from her by the craggy mountain surface, but 
there was nothing for it.  This was the only path.  They must move ahead.  

<p>"I am leaving my pack here,"  she called and shrugged it from her back.  

<p>"All right,  Love.  We will move the packs before I round the path."

<p>Quickly Timber prepared the rope to make a pulley like sling of it with 
a slip not and handed the loop end to Evan.

<p>"Here, Love.  When you have safe footing I will pass you the packs."

<p>Evan nodded and slipped the loop over her shoulder.  She looked back 
at Timber and smiled.  Then turned her concentration to the trail.

<p>"Let's go Black. Be careful girl."

<p>They inched along the narrow path.  Evan could feel the rough surface 
of the mountain wall against her back now that the pack was on the trail 
behind her.  She leaned firm against the solid surface and inched along.  

<p>They were almost to the curve which would take them from view
of Timber and Laural when Black Sky lost her footing.  Evan's breath 
caught in her throat, and she could not keep from crying out as the strong 
body, ever beside them, protecting them,  began to slip over the edge of 
the narrow path to certain death many hundreds of feet below in the dark 
chasm.  Black's great claws dug into the icy surface seeking a hold where 
none existed.  The scratching scrabbling sound continued for a brief moment 
as the great head slipped lower.  

<p>"Black," came Timber's anguished voice.    But then he silenced himself.  
He must not distract her.  By the Lost Gods of the Universe I should not have brought 
any of them, he thought to himself.  I should have come alone.

<p>Finally, Black's claws caught the rocky ledge and held as she teetered 
precariously on the edge of oblivion.  Slowly Evan slid down lowering her 
body to the narrow ledge.  She felt the rocky surface scratch into the soft 
flesh of her back but it did not matter.  She knew it would be difficult to 
stand again, but that did not matter either.  Black's hold was not secure 
enough to pull herself up again.    In another moment Evan was sitting on 
the rocky ledge.  She reached forward with both hands and grasping the thick 
hide on Black's neck.  Slowly she began to pull the heavy animal back to the 
relative safety of the ledge.  She strained as hard as she could,  but she did 
not have the strength to lift Black clear of the chasm.  Behind them on the trail, 
Timber watched helpless.  He saw that the effort was moving Evan closer to the edge.

<p>"Evan, Gods... if you have to... ...if you have to Love,  let her go."  
His heart wrenched  like nothing else to say the words in his mind, 
but he had to make her know he could not lose her.

<p>Evan looked into the deep liquid eyes before her.  She saw the depths of love 
and trust there and knew that she could never let go, no more than she could 
let go of Laural or Timber.  She knew that Timber would never do so.   Worse 
things, she thought.  I have been through worse things.   Suddenly, she bent 
her knees and planted her feet as firmly as she could on the slippery ice of 
the ledge.  She closed her eyes and began to pull harder than ever.  In her 
mind she concentrated on the image of Black Sky being pulled toward her.  The 
black pearl began to glow amber and then the golden light surrounded her.  It 
drifted slowly down her arms and covered Black Sky.  

<p>Timber watched and new he was witness to something Evan had never done 
before this moment.  She was calling on the magic of the pearl with out holding 
it in her hands.  He wasn't sure she even realized she was using the magic.  But 
he could see it flow over them.  Evan seemed to grow stronger and lift Black to 
her as easily as one would lift a kitten.  A moment later her arms were full around 
the wolf and she was being rapidly and lovingly licked in the face.   He watched as 
Evan buried her face in the deep soft fur.  Thank the gods of overearth and 
underearth he thought.  Thank the gods of man and creature.

<p>Evan somehow managed to stand again.  She and Black moved gingerly around 
the ledge and out of sight.  For a few moments Timber could hear only 
the howling of the wind.  Then above the whining, frigid blast he heard her voice.

<p>"We are safe, Love.  We are safe and we both love you so much.  
Send me the first pack"

<p>Timber attached Evan's pack to the looped rope and tugged softly.  Hand 
over hand they passed it between them.  Evan fumbled a moment with the slip 
not and then set the pack behind her on the path.

<p>"Ready for mine now?"  He called.

<p>"Yes, Love."

<p>After the struggle to save Black Sky,  moving the packs along seemed so 
simple and easy.  How could they have ever thought it to be a problem?  
Once the chore was finished, Timber made the rope slack and Evan coiled it 
to her.  She could not see Timber, but she knew he was making ready to move 
toward her and she closed her eyes tightly, her hand reaching out for the 
comfort of Black Sky's warm muzzle.  She heard Black whine softly.   
They would be here in just a minute and the danger would be past.

<p>"I love you, Timber, " she called.  She didn't really expect an answer.  
She knew he would be concentrating on keeping Laural safe and making his way to her.  

<p>Timber took the heavy Sword of Mars from the scabbard and quickly with the 
flick of his hand in just the right way it came apart.  In place of the 
magnificent weapon he held two gleaming daggers.  He secured them at his waist 
for a moment and gathered Laural close against him.   He checked to be certain 
that the leather straps which secured her sleeping little form to him were safe.  
When he was satisfied Laural would be safe,  he took a dagger in each hand.  He 
turned to face the mountain, the chasm at his back.  With a mighty blow he truck 
the dagger of his left hand against the mountain.   The dagger cut through the 
rocky surface like a knife through soft butter.  He tested it and found it  held
firm.  Timber struck again with the other hand and that dagger held firm as well.  
He moved carefully along the path.  With each couple of feet along the way he 
removed the daggers and then struck them home again.  In a few moments he was 
standing next to Evan.  Her arms opened wide, and he moved to embrace her. 
Laural slept safe and warm against his chest.  Black Sky pushed against there 
legs and Timber bent to pet her and caress her soft muzzle.

<p>They moved on then.  Not because they wanted to for the wind and the cold 
and stress of the trail took a toll.  Timber was tired.  He knew that Evan 
must be exhausted, and they were not yet half way to the portal.  He knew that 
her strength was going.  Twice he saw her steps falter and reached out a hand 
to steady her.

<p>"This is to hard for you, Love."  In his head he thought over and over... 
It is to much for them.  I should have come alone.

<p>"Not much farther, honey.  I'm fine."

<p>But she wasn't and Timber could see it.  She needed rest and food and to 
be warm. Finally he heard her sigh as she recognized a landmark..

<p>"It's just ahead now, Timber, a place we can rest, just around the next 
outcropping.  We can build a fire.

<p>Half an hour later they did come to the place Evan told him about.  
Timber eased the pack from his back.  He opened his parka and found Laural warm 
and sound asleep against his chest.  Quickly he built a fire and while Evan 
tended Laural and changed her nappy,  he constructed a leanto from the poles 
that formed the frame for his pack.  He built it against the mountain wall so 
that one side was the mountain.  The opening he faced away from the wind. 
There he built a fire.  When the light frame work was ready, he covered it 
with hides.  Inside he dug out a hollow in the snow and spread more hides 
there.  Finally he was finished.  The shelter was very small.  Just room 
enough for them to crawl inside and lie in the snow hollow.  

<p>"Here,  Love.  Come lie here and get warm, "  he told Evan.

<p>She handed Laural to him and stood.    Her trail leathers which reached 
from her ankles to her waist while wet on the outside were mostly dry  and  
warm on the inside. 

<p>"Better let me have them, Love.  They will dry by the fire."  

<p>Evan stepped out of the legging.  Timber took them from her and draped 
them near the fire to dry.  She stood shivering in her linen pantelets.   
A moment later she bent low and crawled into the shelter.  She turned to 
take Laural from Timber and  nestled down among the furs, pulling them around 
Laural and holding her sleeping daughter close to her to keep her warm.

<p>"Honey aren't you coming?"  

<p>"I thought I would brew us each a warm trail soup and then join you 
love.  You need a bit to eat."

<p>She nodded watching him through the small opening as he moved around 
the fire.  She could only see his high boots and  his knees,  but still 
she watched until her lids grew heavy.  Laural stirred in her arms and 
the tiny fists tugged at the fabric of her blouse.  She opened the buttons 
and Laural found her breast and began to nurse. 

<p>"Don't bite, Mama, Laural," she whispered.   Finally, curled warm 
there among the furs with her daughter in her arms she slept.

<p>Timber made the camp secure and brewed a soup from dried meat.  It 
made a thick rich broth.  When it was ready he bent down to offer some 
to Evan, but she was so soundly sleeping he could not bring himself to 
wake her.  Instead,  he felt exhaustion wash across him as well.  He 
placed the cooking kettle near the fire and searched through his pack 
until he found the bag of barley.  He scooped up a  goodly handful 
knowing it would make a good barley broth stew for when they awoke. 
He added it to the broth in the cooking kettle and gave it a stir.   
At last, he laid on a bit more wood from his pack and banked the fire.  
It would keep them warm for many hours.  He shed his own damp trail 
leathers and hung them near Evan's.   In a moment he was beside them.  
He slid his arm under Evan and pulled her close into his arms. She 
stirred slightly but did not come awake.  He brushed his fingers 
across the swell of her breast and pulled the furs more snugly around 
the three of them.

<p>"Sleep, Love.  All will be well. I promise you.  I promise." 
He kissed her softly and a moment later drifted into a light sleep. 
Soon after Black Sky came to lie at his back.
