The following are pulled from a variety of sources I've flipped through while dealing with this issue on a MUD several years back.  So if you get déjà vu during this, you've been forewarned, and I apologize to those individual authors whom I have taken from here and unfortunately could not remember how to attribute.
<br><br>
<em>1. Pick a character that you can identify with.</em>
<br><br>
One of the problems that players new to role-playing frequently have is that while they wish to role-play their character, they aren't sure how.  This can be compounded by the powergamer voice in all of us that tends to pick a race/class combination that's more powerful versus what we can identify, or effectively role-play, better.  It all comes down to what you want more out of your gaming experience.  It is generally easier, however, to role-play a character that you understand and perhaps identify with, and they will tend to feel a lot more natural as you slip into the role online.
<br><br>
<em>2. Don't stop at using communication as a role-playing tool.</em>
<br><br>
As joked upon frequently, the newbie to role-playing tends to assume that a few Shakespeare-esque 'thee's' and 'thou's' are where role-playing ends.  While it certainly is a good starting point and is usually the most obvious indicator to another player that you are role-playing your character, it's really a small-part of the whole.  The next few points illustrate this.
<br><br>
<em>3. Use your race.</em>
<br><br>
One of the easiest methods to role-play effectively is to start with your race.  Does your race have stereotypical traits, such as racial hatreds?  EverQuest, although its own original world, does have tie-ins with the races used with a long history of gaming and popular fantasy.  For instance, high elves tend to be distrustful of other races, and "snobbish"; dwarves are hard-drinking with mining-based underground societies; etc. etc.  In fact the game gives you specific built-in racial hatreds that you can use in such events as town raids or individual PvP (for instance, on Rallos at least, there is a constant gnome-elf war raging in the Greater Feydark).  The point is that you can use those stereotypes to your advantage, although you certainly shouldn't feel limited by them.
<br><br>
<em>4. Use your class.</em>
<br><br>
This is another easy one, as again the classes in EQ (with one or two exceptions such as the Shadowknight) have been used prominently in other games and books as well.  For example, druids have a special infinity with nature, as do rangers.  Paladins are devoted to righteousness, while the mage-based classes (wizard, necromancer, enchanter, mage) tend to be a bit power-hungry.
<br><br>
<em>5. Use your appearance.</em>
<br><br>
This is usually where the powergamer says "whoa, wait a second," but it is an available tool that you should be aware of.  Maybe having a bare-armed monk or a headwear-less warrior simply appeals to you more; if you are willing to give up the benefits of always using the best equipment, this is another role-playing tool at your disposal.
<br><br>
<em>6. Add something unique.</em>
<br><br>
Given the fact that the races and classes do exist in other mediums it's easy to fall into a rut in that everyone will tend to basically role-play the same class/race combos the same.  Because of this, it can be fun to add some personal spice to your character, and then role-play it.  Maybe your character's a lush, or a fanatical trade skiller (jack o' all trades), or arachnaphobic … the point is that you can significantly add to the experience by including a few traits or abnormalities that you then role-play out.
<br><br>
<em>7. Know why you are role-playing.</em>
<br><br>
This is one that frequently causes problems for both role-players and those that prefer not to.  The hard-core role-player tends to think that everyone should role-play, and that everyone they meet should know that they personally role-play.  There are two inherent problems with that however.  First of all, true role-playing isn't going to be conveyed in a simple meeting, if you are taking it further than just doing it verbally, and you shouldn't attempt to convey it all anyway.  This is what I've always called "role-play overdose," when some rabid rp'er starts babbling about themselves in a well-intended attempt to convey to someone else how neat they are for doing it.  Just like you wouldn't do this in real-life, don't do it in the game.
<br><br>
That brings up a point, however, which is why you are doing it in the first place.  Generally there are two sides to this, the rp'er who does it for their own enjoyment and the rp'er who does it to add something to the game (generally for the other players).  Ideally, from a psychological and etiquette standpoint, I think the answer lies somewhere in between.  This leads however to my next point, which is…
<br><br>
<em>8. Don't be afraid to slip out of character.</em>
<br><br>
One of the dangers of taking role-playing too far in a game (beyond the obvious mental concerns of taking it into the real-world), is that it's too much work, and sometimes it just doesn't fit.  For example, you are working through Crushbone with a few friends, and one starts chatting about his new Pentium III 550.  There are several ways to deal with this.  One is simply join in.  Another, if you are a fervent role-player, is to preface any contributions to the conversation with something like OOC:.  For example,
<br><br>
Donjuan says 'Man, I just stuck a TNT board in my sys, and it just rocks now … what vid card are you using bro?'
<br><br>
You say 'OOC:  I've got a few Voodoo II's.'
<br><br>
Or,
<br><br>
You say 'Sys?  Vid?  What confounded instruments of dark magicks are these!'
<br><br>
Personally, I think doing either of these is a bit much to take, but to each his own.  The point is, however, that rather than get bent out of shape that someone would DARE say something OOC, use a passive restraint if it bothers you rather than bitch because someone didn't fit the profile of what you want other people to be like in the game.
<br><br>
<em>9. If you are not having fun, stop it.</em>
<br><br>
This is the cardinal rule of roleplaying.  You paid for EverQuest (and you continue to pay).  Don't feel any pressure to do it if you don't want to.  I know people who actually get frustrated because they don't feel like they role-play very well, but everyone else does it so they feel they have to as well.  That's a fallacy … always remember it's a game, and the point is to have fun.  If you are not doing so, then you should try to isolate why you aren't; it's possible you just have the wrong class /race for your role-playing mentality.
<br><br>
<em>10. A word about verbal role-playing.</em>
<br><br>
I'm not going to get into a long diatribe about how or how not to communicate on EQ, because part of the fun is learning that yourself … we don't all speak the same or with the same catch phrases in real-life, so why would you try to in EQ?
<br><br>
That being said, one frequently overlooked verbal tool you can use is in fact catch phrases.  Just like in real-life where we all have certain words we use that individualize our specific speech (like 'sweet,' 'heya', etc.), you can set this up in EQ as well.  You can even program a few hotbuttons to do these, assuming you feel the need.  For instance, maybe your fighter bellows a "once more into the breech!" before entering combat, or yells a "For Felwythe!" in mid-combat (OK so those aren't exactly awe-inspiring, but I'm writing this in a minimized window at work and can't test any at the moment).  The point is, you can use verbal tools like that to build complexity (or simplicity, depending on what you hotbutton) into a character.
<br><br>
I'm going to stop here for a moment because in over 20 years of RPG experience, there is one thing that is so insidious, so wrong-headed, so annoying to me that I can't even include it in the previous list because its importance overshadows all of the others.  Ready?
<br><br>
<em>* Dwarves are not from Scotland / Ireland.</em>
<br><br>
There, I said it.  I have no idea where this started or why, but there is nothing more annoying than having a dwarf call me 'laddie' or my personal favorite, 'boyo,' so knock it the Hell off.  After about 10 minutes walking through southern and northern Kaladim I feel like I zoned into a bad Sean Connery convention.  If you need verbal instruction on how a dwarf would probably speak, there are plenty of great books on them in TSR's Forgotten Realms and DragonLance series.
<br><br>
I hope this helped.  If you are looking for additional role-playing resources you can find several on the Web.  Additionally the fantasy section of your local bookstore is a great resource, especially for learning about the racial and class stereotypes.
