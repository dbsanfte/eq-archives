<br><br>
    Kinory went across the rooftops, avoiding light, every nerve tuned to a painful pitch.  She leapt at every scrape and whisper of movement, eyes wide, heart beating a rapid rhythm against her ribs.  She made her way to the docks and hid in an abandoned warehouse.  The echoing building still had boxes and rotting sails strewn across the floor, though anything of value had long since been carted away.  Kinory slipped into the shadows in a corner where she could see the door, and took stock.

	It was going to be a bright and shiny day for young Neren.  Atop a tree in the Greater Faydark Forest, he watched the sun rise form its lair, banishing the moon.  He heard the morning calls of the wolves, the sweeping breezes, the twittering of the birds.  He watched an Orc hatchetman march his way to Crushbone, the headquarters of the evil Orcs.
<br><br>
	Neren found himself singing the battle chant of the war his father had fought and died in.  He was too young to understand the news back then, but now sorrow swept in.  Nine years have passed since that war, twelve years since his birth.

<b>Endless Dreams</b>

Bristlebane the pain hurts!  I feel like I just got struck by some crazy wizard's lighting bolt.  I feel dispatched from my body, as if I am looking down on myself.  My back is bowed almost to the breaking point and my lips are curled back over my teeth.  I vaguely remember the man with the gray eyes.  He is all I can remember actually.  Those damn gray eyes.  Swirling like mist in the wind.  This pain, Bristlebane it hurts!  I roll across the hard stone floor and smash my nose into the wall.  My nose breaks as I hear a loud crack and blood spurts into my eyes and over my face.   I lay there on the cold floor for who knows how long.  Eventually I fall asleep, that is if the dreamscape I enter can be called that

I got a smile last week.  I had occasion to send Brad McQuaid an e-mail of a reasonably urgent type, and he responded.  Sure, that made me happy, but it's not what made me smile.  It was a question that he asked me at the end of his response.  He asked me, simply, if I had forgiven him for the RP switch…

As can be expected from last week's editorial, I went on to play on a Race War server this week.  I was lucky enough to be able to get in right away when Verant brought them up earlier than expected, and so got in with the first rush.

Dear Oghma,
 <br><br>
 I often sit down, when I am a bit tired of playing EverQuest, and read your articles. Most of the time I agree with what you write, and so also in the last article in the 85th edition if the EQExpress. EverQuest is my third online game so far, UO I played for one week, before putting it away, whilst Realm, with it's simplistic graphics kept me going for quite some time. But, as all games do, Realm got old, but there is ONE thing that I still admire both the Realm staff and the staff of Sierras next game, Middle Earth: Comunication. Verant lacks much of this. Why you might wonder. They have frequent interviews and they post updates every time they even just added a rock to EverQuest's landscape... but what they don't do, is when small things go wrong.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a cleric of the 20th Circle and regularly track my stats.  I have noticed that since my One Handed & Two Handed Blunt scores reached 80, they have stopped improving.  Why haven't my weapons skills improved?  I regularly use them but I just don't understand. . . .
</I><BR>
<br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This isn't a question but, rather, another macro suggestion which elaborates on one of the ones you mention in your article.   Line 1: /say HELP !! Please!!  Line 2: /loc    When you are in panic mode and are afraid you might die, this will do the trick.  Thanks for the great articles!
