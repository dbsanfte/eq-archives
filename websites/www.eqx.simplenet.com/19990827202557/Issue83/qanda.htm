<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest news is that it will be available some time in the first quarter of next year.  If all goes well it will be out on the anniversary of the release of EverQuest about March 16th.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Im on server Quellious if you ever want to join a rogue wood elf...my question is, (and don't think I haven't been playing while, cuz I have), but how do I create a macro button?  ie-a button you push and it automatically types what you've preset it to.Dral

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;To create a macro, you need to start in 'windowed' mode, that is, where you can see the frame around your characters view and all of the buttons and options.  On the left hand side of this window you will see three buttons; Abilities, Combat and Socials.  Click socials.  You'll see several buttons in the boxes below (where you see 'corpse', 'anon', 'split', etc.).  Pick one that you don't think you'll use, like 'play', since you'll never need to find out the time you've been playing your character in a big hurry.  Right click the button that you want to change.  A box will replace your text box.  The top entry in this box will be the name of the macro.  This is for your reference only, so just name it something that will help you remember what the macro says.  I've chosen 'Rides'...  it makes sense to me!  The box just to the right with the little letter A in it is for choosing the color of the text on your macro button.  Click it until it is the color you want.
<br><br>
Then below that is the actual macro.  Click on the first line (where I have '/say I am offering assistance to anyone that is truly').  Note that anything you have on that line will be erased when click on it, so editing isn't possible.  Make sure you type whatever you want in the line correctly the first time.  If you want a /shout message, just type it in there exactly as you would type it into the normal text screen.  When you're done, just click done.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was wondering how one might go about hearing of event on the Mithraniel Marr realm - I have visited EverEvent, and NOTHING is listed for MM.  There has GOT to be something going on.BTW, I love the Express - makes for some very entertaining and informative reading while sitting and healing.  Keep it up!
