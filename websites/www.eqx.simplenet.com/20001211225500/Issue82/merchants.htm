Ever wonder why the various Merchants and townsfolk in Norrath (any server) aren't very talkative? You wander into a shop and hail the merchant. He looks at you in a goofy, absent-minded, cross-eyed manner and says something to the effect of "hello, player. Could I interest you in a rusty short sword?"
<br><br>
Then there is no additional statement. You can hail them, ask them questions, or generally turn the air blue with multi-lingual epitaphs and they simply will no longer acknowledge your presence (unless you attack them, of course: then, they'll know you're there!) until you hand them coin or sell them an item from your inventory.
<br><br>
In the interest of expanding knowledge of our world, I think I may have stumbled upon the answer to this mystery and thought I'd share it with you.
<br><br>
The reason the Norrathian townsfolk won't engage in idle chitchat is because they are all, to a person, severely genetically damaged. They've been engaging in about five or six generations of some pretty severe crossbreeding.
<br><br>
No, seriously. Think about it. Ever take a walk through East and West Commons and notice how virtually every male merchant is an identical double of Paldor The Blessed? The answer is obvious. Everyone in the zone is both everyone's Father and everyone's Brother in Law!
<br><br>
This is the only explanation that makes sense, once you think of it. It explains the numbness of tongue. It explains the near clone-like appearance of each of the merchants. It explains the apparently psychotic and mindless wanderings that certain of these merchants just love to engage in when you're looking to buy their wares! It also explains the annoying tendency of certain products in their inventories that seem to keep appearing and disappearing, occasionally, at random intervals: these mindless puppies are simply playing with their best wares behind the counter when you're not looking.
<br><br>
Nothing worse than a merchant playing with his wares, I'd say. After a hobby like THAT, cross breeding is probably just another Norrathian Trivial Pursuit! :-)
<br><br>
This bizarre habit can also explain their strange product pricing schemes, I would venture. Each of these brain-damaged merchants has no real CLUE as to the value of the product he or she is selling or buying from you: when pressed to make an apparently "intelligent" choice, they're simply picking a random number, perhaps by means of the /random macro.
<br><br>
The crossbreeding explanation may even explain their notable tendency to spend the better part of each business day avoiding a profit by standing on the roof of their shops! Obviously, they are busy fulfilling their inner child's desire to play "Tarzan" at their customer's expense. They are experiencing their second childhood this WEEK. :-)
<br><br>
What happens to those interbreeding Norrathian merchants who, eventually, lose all trace of their genetic and mental stability, you ask? Simple answer: Ever run across one of those Desert of North Ro MADMEN? Enough said!
<br><br>
So, now that we have been enlightened about this sad state of affairs, what can we, as brave Norrathian Adventurers, due to heal our beloved land of this blight? How can we, mere warriors, shamans, clerics, wizards, etc, help correct this horrible condition?
<br><br>
There is only one answer that I can see and the scope of this solution is so huge, so large, that it will take the dedicated effort of each and every one of us to rectify this disaster.
<br><br>
To fix this problem, we will have to, occasionally, sacrifice some of our hunting and questing time and devote ourselves to the task at hand: introducing some new genetic material into the general Norrathian population...
