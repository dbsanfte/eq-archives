In keeping with my promise last week, I wanted to spend a few moments talking about the people involved at the heart of EverQuest.
<br><br>
I've had the opportunity to get to know a few of the folks that actually make this game.  I'm not pals with Brad or anything, dang it.  But I have had the chance to talk to several of the folks that push and pull the code in 989 Studios, and I think they are a pretty darned dedicated group.  Bright too.  Now I may not agree with all of their decisions while making the game, but I think that they want something similar to what I want when it goes retail.  I can say that I think that the things you have heard Brad say about his vision for the game is the truth.  And it can be seen in the beta.
<br><br>
Let me tell you about the first time I logged in to EverQuest.  I found myself in a place that looked much like a fortress.  I fiddled around, trying to learn how to study my spells, how to cast them, how to equip my weapon (and NO, I did not read the manual.)  After a bit I wandered around the place, looking for someone else to talk to.  All I found were NPCs.  Then I ran into a man with the unusual name 'a grizzly bear' over his head.  He hated me a lot, and killed me.  I was not at all sure why (turns out that I discover later that the graphics for grizzly bears were not in the game yet, and a standard male human was used to represent them until they could be put in).  I decided to avoid him, and went the other way.  The first brilliant thing that I managed was to fall off a balcony.  Huff.  Dead again.
<br><br>
Get a message from Aradune, asking me how it's going.  I tell him that I'm struggling a bit, but that I hadn't had time to get used to things yet.  He tells me to make sure that I let him know if I have any suggestions.  I promise him that I will.
<br><br>
How did 'a grizzly bear' get over here?  Dead again.
<br><br>
Finally outside the fortress I meet a zombie…   Dead again.
<br><br>
Try to recover my corpse, got lost…  nearly out of food.
<br><br>
Then I get a message from some guy, asking me how it was going.  At this point I'm getting pretty frustrated.  I tell him that I'm having one heck of a time.  He suddenly appears next to me.  Quickly I find out that I have discovered my first bug and didn't even know it.  It seems that Half-Elven Bards were the only class that still had a screwed up starting point.  I was starting in a place where I could never survive.  This fella (turns out it was Mike Hutchins) got me set in the right town, Qeynos, and I was off and running.  I received no less than three separate training sessions about how to do things from different 989 employees.  I felt well taken care of.
<br><br>
Even now, with a bazzillion people in the game, I can still get help.  Only once have I failed to get a response when asking for help or just making a comment, and that one time was just before a pwipe when things were a bit insane.  And that has nothing to do with my association with EQX, since I haven't used Absor for a character name in a long time.  They were just responding to another question in their usual dutiful way.
<br><br>
And there is a dedication to roleplaying from the designers.  I've watched it happen.  In fact the world is undergoing it's first large scale event.  While <b>I</b> would have done some of it differently (a <b>sneak</b> attack, I tell ya!  They shoulda swam in!  I was at the docks waiting…), the event itself is a big hit.  And it has been set up properly.  There are clues in the game, hints that a powergamer (and let's not send me letters on this, please) may not notice, or if they notice them they may not care.  For those paying close attention, talking to PCs and NPCs alike, the events are unfolding in a way that might even satisfy me.  I'm not telling you what the event is.  Heck, I only know the basics.  But the clues are there…
<br><br>
They have instituted things like factions (that's the thing that Brad has been referring to this whole last year by saying things like "We have some great ideas about alignments, we just can't tell you about them yet").  They have stuck behind the idea of a large world (though they are still feeling around for that fine line between small and too damn small).  They listen to us, too.  We continue to see changes to the game that the testers asked for.  And not just every idea that testers scream for, but the ones that make sense.  I can't even tell you how many people think that their favorite class is too weak, or that something is too inconvenient for them.  The designers of EverQuest have done a good job of separating the whining from the reasonable suggestions.  And yes, dueling was added almost entirely based on a suggestion made on one of the newsgroups.  They DO listen.  And there are actual discussions on matters between the testers and the designers.
<br><br>
They have also started working on their guide system.  I can say that they have made some very good choices for people to found this system.  And the rules being set down now make me think that there will be a solid, reliable and honest guide staff there to assist us when the game goes retail.  I can't give enough praise for the guides and the work they do.
<br><br>
Look at it this way.  We know that these 989 guys can do network code.  We've seen Tanarus.  I think even some of the folks at 989 are just a bit surprised at how good their network folks are.  I don't think any of you that have seen the screen shots (and they will never do the game justice) can doubt that the game looks great.  They have the skill.  I think they have the dedication and the vision to make this work.  They're not perfect, but they'll do.
<br><br>
Maybe next week I'll stop sucking up and talk about how the game actually works.
