<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello all I have a cleric question. Does the Divine Aura which gives brief invulnerability to self work? I scribed it into my spell book, then sat to memorize it and was ready to use it but the icon never appeared and was grey when it looks like when the icon is ready to appear. It said "you haven't recovered yet!"  P.S. This is the first time reading your letter. I'm very impressed at the layout. It's simple and easy to read. Also love the Q&A. Keep up the great work. 
<br>

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the Divine Aura spell does work.  However, there are two things you need to know about spells like this one.  The first one is that the Divine Aura spell can only be used about every 15 minutes, so your button will be grey for the interval.  When the icon comes up again, you can re-cast the spell.  The second thing you need to know is that when you mem the spell after scribing it, the same time limit kicks in.  Thus, when you mem the spell, the button will stay grey for 15 minutes before the icon will appear.  If by the time you read this, you still have not gotten the Divine Aura icon so that you can use it, you should petition and ask a guide to go through the steps with you and see if something weird has happened.  Thanks for the compliments!

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say you have a base int of 110 and you use magic aids such as rings to up your int to 140. Then you level. If you take off the int increasing items in favor of others, will you lose the mana benefits gained by leveling at a higher int? 
<br>
Aaraorn Ebonheart
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I was going to have to give you an "I Stumped Nep" award on this one and then got so many differing answers when I asked other players, that I figured I'd never be able to respond.  Enter Zeddic, the wizard, now duly inducted into my Pillars of Wisdom, with the following explanation:  Your base int is like a glass of water and the contents of the glass are your Max mana.  If you tried to put more water in the glass when it was already full, it would overflow and would not be able to hold anything more than you have in it.  However, if you make a bigger glass by getting more int from wearing items, there's lots more room so your Max mana can be larger.  Now, you take off your int items and guess what?  You are back to a smaller glass again and it can't hold all the mana the larger one could.  What is interesting here is that if you put your int items back on again to get the larger glass, it won't be full of mana immediately but will take time to fill up again.   Thus, if I understand it right, no matter what level you are, you will still need the extra int in order to get Max mana.   I hope I got it right and by the way, this explanation on int is only for the mage/casters as cleric/casters use wisdom for their mana.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, wonderful know-it-all... Just a simple question... how do you hotkey a message? For example, /loc or an auction message? 
<br>
Tyressia
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Grin, if I knew it all I wouldn't need the dozens of people I run to every week for help, particularly the Pillars of Wisdom and a very knowledgeable gnome.  (It's just plain hard to imagine a gnome as a pillar. Hmm, gonna have to have a new category for him!)  However, the answer to your question is actually fairly simple.  In windowed mode, you could click on your socials key and it will bring up the preprogrammed social keys.  Right click on a social key you don't mind re-programming.  You will then get a box where you can change the social designation and the message.  Thus, if you want a /loc, you could type Loc on the title line, and the below type /loc.  When you have finished with the social, click done and you will see the new designation on your socials key.  From that point, you click on the social key, holding it down until a little floating box forms and then you simply slide the box over to an empty hotkey slot and click it in.    With an auction message it would be essentially the same except that in the box to change the social you would start with /auction and then type your message.  It looks like there is lots of room there for a long message but it really doesn't work that way so prepare to be brief.  If you have a long message, you may have to create more than one social button and more than one hot key to get the entire message out.  I sure wish they would change that as the public only gets to hear my short poems and I never get to read the long ones out loud in a smooth uninterrupted manner.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, not a question, nor even quite an answer, but a response.  I have been reading back issues of Q&A and saw in issue 87 a question about the woman on the cover of the box etc.  I have also wondered if she was based on a real person because I used to know someone who looked exactly like her (minus of course the pointed ears and the exceptionally large non ears).  We were friends when I lived in San Francisco and the resemblance is so true that I have wanted to contact the artist to see if they knew Tracy.  I haven't seen Tracy in many years, so cannot ask her, but if anyone is ever being treated by a physical therapist in northern California who looks familiar but for the ears, tell her I said hi...
<br>
Shumshum
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I did try to find out for you on this and the best answer I have gotten so far is that yes she was based on a real person, but  who and where I don't know.  I do know, however, that the only reason they didn't put a half-elf on the cover is because someone, somewhere, is not allowing half-elven women to wear pretty clothes.  (Looks askance at high elf lobbyists!)  Not to say that the woman on the cover isn't beautiful if you go in for the golden haughty look, but I bet the game would have sold twice as many copies if half-elven females could wear dresses and if a very fashionable, charming, elegant, and appealing half-elf maiden had been placed on the box cover instead.  Personal opinion, of course!
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a question about foraging. I was wondering why water is so much harder to find than foodstuffs? I have personally stood in knee deep water while it was raining and still was not able to forage some water. Plus I've also noticed what you really need never turns up. If you're starving all you get is water, if you're dying of thirst only food do you find. Is this intentional? Plus on the best food liquid controversy, foraged stuff has to be the best(when you can find it).  I personally have not bought any food in...let me think back...several months at least and water for at least a month. Of course not all classes have been blessed with this talent. I know what I just said is contradictory but the good far outweighs the ill when it comes to forage. Last question is about the special foraged items (e.g., cinnamon sticks and what not). I know they exist, I've found some cinnamon sticks sitting on the ground in Felwithe (I guess some high elves just don't like spices.) Anyway I have never been able to find any myself. Is it based on skill level because I'm at what I heard is "mastery" of a skill (101 correct me if I'm wrong) or is it based on zone? Thanks.
<br>
Tauithar, Ranger of Tunare, 19th circle, fletcher semi-extraordinaire, Fennin Ro
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, it is so nice to have friendly rangers about to help on a question like this.  Essentially, there was vociferous agreement that the answer to the first part of your question should be "evil programmers" who only made 3 kinds of water while apparently creating are 27 kinds of foraged food.  Thus, it seems like it's a lot easier to come up with food.  As for standing kneedeep in water and foraging nothing to drink, hmm, well let's chalk it up to evil programmers again because it has to be that or else gremlins fiddling with your forage button.  Forage is a lovely skill and isn't it great to be able to save your money for rewarding bards for their songs and stories?  Now, the last question was whether it took certain skill levels in foraging to be able to find special items like cinnamon sticks.  The best the rangers I asked could tell me was that it seems like what you forage simply has more to do with luck and location (zone)  than with skill level.  Both rangers did recommend a web site called "The Ranger's Glade" for more information but I'm sorry, I don't have an address for you.  (Plus if it is a total spoiler site I take back my recommendation!)  Hope this helps.  Wouldn't some of those cinnamon sticks heated in elven wine give off a lovely aroma on a cold winter night?
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this is sorta related to the magic boots question in Issue 97.  I know monks can but I was wandering if any other class, with magical gloves on, can hit magical creatures?  Especially Bards.
<br>
Jadbut
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a timely question indeed.  Just this week, the EQ News from the patch stated that bards will be able to hit magical creatures with magic gloves and with magical instruments.  As far as other classes punching with magic gloves, I'm afraid I don't know.  My guess is that if there were gloves that they could wear, they'd be able to hit magical creatures but the damage, of course, would be a lot less than with a weapon.  However, I'm not sure if there are any unrestricted magic hand items like gloves out there.  Glad I could answer on the bard part though!
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Has anyone every had any success begging for coins/items from an NPC?  If so, whom?
<br>
Andrielle Angelique
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, in the Q&A  Column a couple months back (I'm sorry I don't remember the issues number but they were in the high 80's I think), two people wrote in about the begging question, one of whom said that a friend of his had actually begged a full plat off an npc.   I have not yet heard of anyone who has managed to beg anything but coins from an npc, even with mastery of the begging skill.  It would be so much fun though if someone could confirm that they had actually managed to beg an item off an npc.  Let me know if you have heard of anyone doing this and what they received.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the question (last week about Half-Elf Paladins), I must humbly beg to differ with your reply that there are no half elven paladins. You see, I myself am living proof that there are. I don't know where you got your information, but there is definitely nothing in our nature that would prevent us from making such a noble and honorable profession our own!
<br>
Aunor, half elven paladin of Xegony
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh my goodness, I really really was wrong on that one.  I could spin a tale about a haughty elven bard guildmaster who deliberately hid information from me out of a completely prejudicial attitude toward half-elves like me and like you, but the truth of the matter is, I didn't know and didn't check and guessed.  And, I was horribly wrong.  Thank goodness half-elves have received acceptance by the paladin guilds.  Thank goodness also, that your honorable profession has taught you to treat lazy half-elf bards with kindness and civility even when the bard in question didn't know what she was talking about. 
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is so that ALL special attacks that a monk has are considered magical. =)
<br>
Yeshe McGermot
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the question about magical boots and your answer of "magical attack becomes available somewhere in the mid-twenties to thirties levels for monks at least" Our Special attacks become magical right after we dump round kick.   I do hear from my higher brothers and sisters that magical gloves are no longer needed for our punches at around the 35 level. 
<br>
Thentar SteelPalm
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Monks don't need magic boots to kick Magic creatures.  The schtick about a monk is that their "special" moves are magically enhanced by their god.  Warriors and Rangers, however, would need magic boots to kick a magic creature.   Another thing =)  Monks get a kick at level 3 or 5.  This is the only non-magical kick that they get.  That kick WILL require magic boots, but by the time you even get to Will o' Wisp levels, you will be using a better strike. 
<br>
Woodmuffin
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Nepenthia, I would like to correct you on your opinion that Monks get magic attacks in the 20-30 region. They do get Magic attacks as low as level 5 when Round Kick is available to them! You don't need no magical boots or anything, the skill is enough to hit magical enemies. 
<br>
Myrian, Lvl 12 Monk, Solusek Ro
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In issue 97 you mention that Monks get magical attacks in the mid 20's or 30's.  I am an 11th level monk.  I have 2 magical attacks, not counting the magical gloves that I wear to make my normal hand to hand attacks magical:  Round kick and Tiger claw are both magical attacks.  I use them regularly against willowisps. 
<br>
Shando
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In issue 97, you stated monks get magic attacks in the mid to high 20's. I am not sure about that, being only level 11, but with my mesh gloves on I have no problem hitting Willowisps, and my special attacks (Round Kick and Tiger Claw so far) hit them also. 
<br>
Ryain
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you all for your explanations of magical attacks by monks.  I'm so amazed and so glad that you each took the time to send in this information and clarify the magical attack question as to monks.  So far this issue, I've learned about monks, and caught up with bard magical attacks (from this past week's patch news).  I understand, of course, that other melee classes have magical weapons that allow them to fight magical creatures, but if anyone would like to fill me in on other items that give melee fighters magical attacks, I'd be really interested to learn about it.  Sometimes, as much as I love my name of Nepenthia Dreamsinger, I think I should be titled "Nepenthia The Perpetually Curious"!  So please write if you have more to add to this conversation.
<br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a question but a response to the question about research in issue 97. First he needs to train the ONE point he is allowed. You are only allowed to train one point at 16. The asker even has the book to practice with already. What he needs to do is find out who to normally gives the book away and go see what they want for the practice rune recipe books. I believe if he is one of the "accepted" good races he might want to ask the residents of the Karanas and if of an evil alignment look to the deserts.
<br>
Sadil
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, this sounds like fun actually!  Thanks for writing in with your information and suggestions.  I hope researchers out there will benefit from your knowledge.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, This isn't a question, just an answer. I just thought, after reading about the swimming through the Ocean of Tears questions, I would try it myself to get the answer. So, I did. I searched for about 30 minutes in the East Freeport water, and finally decided it was impossible to get through when (as if the gods were telling me it could be done) the boat arrived and I found the area it zoned from. After about 10 more minutes, I finally found the exact spot the boat came from, and went through into the Ocean of Tears. After stopping by Tunare's Isle, I headed towards Faydwer. Eventually, I came to the zone line and floated around until I made it into Butcherblock (took almost an hour to find it, and almost drowned several times while pushing against the zone line).  So, believe it or not.. YES, you can swim across the ocean. 
<br>
Darthias Crimsi
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, I have gone to Pillars of Wisdom who tell me over and over again that this simply is not possible.  If you happen to ever visit Veeshan and see me on, I'd be interested in a demonstration but until that time, I'm going to have to wonder exactly what you did as I have been told over and over again that the boat zoning does not work like a regular zone boundary and that it is impossible to zone even where the boat goes.  I'm not saying I don't want to believe you, but this is one of those times I gotta see it to believe it.  Thanks for letting me know of your experience though and feel free to demonstrate for me!
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an answer on the Dark Elf Question about shopping in Commons in the last issue.
<br>
1) Killing Orcs - Yes if you kill enough orcs you can shop in the commons.  My level 12 wizard could shop there, though only with the Innkeepers in the center.  The people in the left and right parts of the inns still won't speak to him.
<br>
2) Doing Quests - There are some fabulous quests in Freeport to build faction.  My wizard cons warmly  in there and gets prices almost as good as shopping in Neriak.
<br>
Forbin
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks so much for writing.  When I see dark elves buying out the stores in Freeport, I will know who helped them attain such grand shopping sprees.  Now if the dark elves would show some proper appreciation for music and stories and see to it that the bards of Freeport are well supplied with food and wine, then I might find a tiny place in my heart to start to like them a little bit.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;WHERE is my Auntie Moog gone? :~(Did the trolls find out she tell us about nice ogre ooga booga or she eat some bad grog and have go away for awhile?where is she! 
<br>
Xandrea Hopebringer
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Auntie Moog will be backkkkkkkkkkkk!  Send in your questions to her and don't be surprised if the word "barshing" starts popping up in your conversations again like it did before.  I didn't hear the reason for her vacation but have been assured that she did not visit a health spa for complexion treatments or massaging away the rough bits of her skin.  However, knowing Auntie Moog, if she ever did enter a spa, I doubt you could ever get her away from the mud baths even with the most delectable gnome noshes.  Like you, I will be glad to see her back and in fine form.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, If zoning from South Karana to North Karana underwater means the same thing as zoning from Ocean of Tears to Freeport / Kaladim, then you CAN NOT zone while swimming.  When I did it, from S Karana to N Karana, the game knocked me off the map and redirected me to the south of the bridges.  Guess I was wrong :)  HEY three more weeks.... I wonder what you all will do for your 100th issue?  Hmmmmm (goes into deep thought).   Oh yeah here's my idea for houses:*
<br>
OK my housing idea is quite similar to The Realm's idea (it's an old RPG made by Sierra... I think some people might still play it).  Ok, when you are created, you start out with a house.  That's the Realm.... now I think in EQ you should buy your house.  Like 10,000 plat for a one room house or something.  "Now Aalon, how do you get to a house once you have it?"  Well, say there's a person in every zone.  And you say to him "I wish to go to Aalon's home" or whatever.  And he transports you there.  Outside that is.  When you walk on the door, your hand has a "magical" touch that opens the door.  Only you can only open your door, no one else can.  "So Aalon what would be the point of a house?"  Well, these ideas I got from some MUD.  I think it was Moongate.  Anyway, for an addition cost, you could buy "flags".  I don't me banners, I mean like "indicators".  Examples would be... I dunno, "faster HP regen rate", "faster mana regen rate", "less mana consumption", "no food consumption", "PvP".  Etc.  The PvP could be for friendly duels and whatever.  Now I think you could also "buy" NPCs to stick in your home.  Like a banker, or a personal belongings keeper.  The banker would act like any other banker in Norrath, and the personal belongings keeper would be like a whole new bank account.  Except only available at your house.  Also, with every purchase of your house, it comes with an NPC to, like, "zap" you back to town.  "I wish to return" and it would take you back to the town you were in when you said "I wish to go to Aalon's house".  There could also be a "I wish to summon Temolan" command, where a box comes up on Temolan's screen, and says "Aalon is summoning you to his house.  Will you go?"  Kinda like the acceptance of a resurrect box.  Also to summon someone, Aalon would have to be inside his house and Temolan would have to be in any town.  Hmm, I think there should be different types of houses like "one room house", "two room house" "guild hall".  I think guild halls should have different flags with them too, or default ones.  Like say you buy a "small guild hall".  I think it should come with.... a banker, a "faster HP regen rate" flag, a "guild PvP" flag (where guildmates can attack other guildmates freely), and... 3 rooms.  The "large guild hall" should come with the same things as the small one, a personal belongings keeper, a "faster mana regen rate" flag, a "no food consumption" flag, and should come with... 3 rooms downstairs and 2 rooms upstairs.  Just my ideas.  They sound even better when I write them down :)  I think I will send this idea to Verant.  Maybe I'll become famous... hahahhahah what was I thinking, I bet'cha Verant never reads this.  But it's worth a try :)
<br>
Aalon
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for your weekly tome.  By the way, I never did get any other responses to which race is the cutest.  I guess everyone was too busy focusing on individual cuties to really want to engage the question.  On the subject of houses, I don't really expect to see them in Norrath.  Of course times change, and I never say never!  Dibs on the first cottage for bards.  Join me there someday and we'll laugh about the old days when Nep said there'd never be houses.  Oh, and finally, yes the 100th issue of EQ Express is rapidly coming up.  I'm wondering if it would be cool for anyone who would like to submit a special question for the issue to look at his or her own class and either think of a question they haven't had answered yet or remember back to their younger times and send in a question that was hard for them to get an answer to and yet important to their development.  Just a thought.  All questions that a non-techie and non-Verant employee can answer are always welcome.





<br><br><br>
Note from Nep:  Thanks again for all who write with questions and comments and answers.  I always look forward to hearing from you.  Those of you who enjoy writing and might like to submit articles or stories or poems or whathaveyou, please do think about it.  Someplace on the website is a link to click for submission information and we'd love to have you consider EQExpress as a place to send your work.
