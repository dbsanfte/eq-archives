I just wanted to write a quick email letting you (the EQX Staff) know that I really enjoy reading your articles each week.  I especially enjoy reading Absor's editorials and Razor's insights into family (or friends) gaming with EverQuest.  I find Oghma's writings and Archanalia's art work to be interesting also.  Many other contibutors submitt fine works also.
 <br><br>
Keep up the great work!  I am sure that EverQuest's captive audience and current testers (players) really appreciate the work you guys put into this online news site, as do I.

Hey all,
 <br><br>
Just a bit of fan mail for Archanalia.  I have had a rollickin' good time with Little Archy and other EQX articles and just want to let the fella know that his contributions to EQX are enjoyed and appreciated.
