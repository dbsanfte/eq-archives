<b>Part Four</b>
<br><br>
<em>In a smoky room of the dark Inn of Freeport, the soft music of the lute fades to a lingering note as the Bard unfolds three faded parchments.  The patrons can see the scrawling words written on them.  He stands and pulls out the first reading in a soft spellbinding voice...</em>

<br><br>
	My name is Diane, and I am a Paladin of Mithaniel Marr, the God of Truth, Brother to Erollisi Marr, the Goddess of Love.  People have often asked me why I am not simply a cleric that venerates both Mithaniel and Erollisi, and to be honest I have to tell them I don't know why, for I firmly believe that in Truth there IS Love and beauty, and in Love there is only Truth.  When I discuss these issues with most people I usually see their eyes glaze over in about ten minutes, and I can hear the sharp metallic <em>snicks!</em> of their minds closing.  Simple minded buffoons all, they.   I have to constantly remind myself that true knowledge of one's spiritual self is a knowledge that is only gained through deep thought, a process that our lifestyle in this day and age makes difficult to accomplish.  I know truly that there is an answer to this dilemma that lies within the deeper mysteries of the Marr twins, an enlightenment that is still waiting for me to comprehend it.  I pursue the way of Truth because love can only come through if there is truth first.  That is why the three assassins who had just tried to kill me didn't love me, as was evidenced by the fact that they were absolutely not interested in discussing the finer points of Mithaniel's Truth at all.  But that is o.k., because I had already had an idea as to who had sent them in the few seconds before they attempted harm on my person.  I think it was the words, "Kill 'er, ya bleedin' fools!  Hargor won't like it if she walks outta here alive!"  So I lovingly, yet firmly admonished them upon their pointed noggins with the shaft of my scythe, and carted their collective untruthful personages to the nearest guard.
<br><br>
	So now I sit in the dark in Hargor's study waiting for him to return.  There was a thunderstorm brewing outside that matched the murder in my heart.  By Marr!  What if he had done the same thing to t'Ceira and Darvinn?
<br><br>
	Let me explain. . . 
<br><br>
	This morning, I returned to Hargor's place to see if my two friends, t'Ceira and Darvinn, had gotten off safely.  When I arrived I noticed a small cart parked in the school's cemetery with a bundle in the back, and two shovels in the hands of two strapping youths of ill repute that I had seen hanging around getting into trouble off and on in Freeport.  At first I thought nothing of it, perhaps our illustrious Hargor was trying to teach some wayward youths the value of good hard work.  Who knows?  
<br><br>
	At any rate, when I tried to gain entrance Ranor, another student of Wizardry, stood at the door and handed me a note, saying, "Sorry M'Lady, but M'Lord has had to travel suddenly to check up on the arrangements you had discussed with him earlier."  The young student seemed to be interested in looking everywhere else except at me.
<br><br>
	"What happened?"  The boy was definitely upset about something.
<br><br>
	"He didn't say.  Just wanted me to give you this note."
<br><br>
	"Ranor, is there something wrong?  You look like you just got caught in a lie." I asked gently.
<br><br>
	That got his attention.
<br><br>
	"What?  No!  M'Lady!  You know me better than that!  It's-"
<br><br>
	"Don't call me Lady, Ranor, you know I am not royalty!  Now out with it!"
<br><br>
	"Well. . . there's been. . . a death. . . ."  Ranor suddenly found the front of his student's robe extremely interesting.
<br><br>
	"What the- who!?"  But even as he said "Lysinda", a sickly suspicion began to dawn in the back of my mind.  
<br><br>
	I barely heard Ranor say, "Master Hargor said it was an accident, something about her not being properly centered during her attempt of a spell. . ."  His words faded out of my consciousness as  memory unfolded.
<br><br>
	I remembered the first time I had met Lysinda.  She lived in the wharf district of Freeport, but she liked to hang around in the simple home of the Paladin's of my beloved Lord, Mithaniel Marr, a place I frequented daily.  As a matter of fact, I had been a student at the time, and as a student one of my favorite places to relax had been the extensive library located in it's maze of rooms and winding stairs.  I had entered there during free time one afternoon, only to find I was not alone, and the volume I had wanted was, in fact, in the hands of the only other person in attendance, which caused my eyebrows to raise slightly.   The volume was a weighty treatise on virtue, and the young slip of a girl reading it looked barely able to hold the book, let alone digest it's considerable content.  Sighing, I turned to the shelves, trying to remember the second choice of reading material on my list, when I heard her ask, "Excuse me, ma'am, but do you think you could put this up for me, please?" 
  <br><br>
	I turned to find the young woman offering the volume to me.  I accepted the work from her small hand, and feeling a bit peevish and wanting to show off my superior grasp of the principles involved in the book, being as I had read up to chapter six, I said, "I found chapter five interesting but relatively uninformative.  What about you?"
<br><br>
	She stood next to me, her eyes searching other titles on the shelf.  "You only say that because you haven't read past five yet.  Five contains the key to the whole work, which you would know if you read all the way to chapter twelve.  Yet, after having read this particular work three times now, I would have to say that Honare's work on the state of righteousness because of faith explains the root of virtue much more clearly."
<br><br>
	I turned and studied her.  I guessed her to be five years, maybe six, younger than me.  "You've read Honare?" I asked flatly in unbelief.  <em>I</em> had not even read Honare yet, that was reserved for upper classman study.
<br><br>
	"Yes ma'am!" she bobbed her head in enthusiasm.  "I've also read your copy of the Historea di' Norrath in Eruditin, Galwyn's ten volumes on the rise of the Bremoni Empire, and even some of your Lotman, although you are missing three of them."
<br><br>
	After I reeled my jaw back up, I began talking to this rather intriguing young person.  Her name was Lysinda, and while she was not a student as I had at first assumed she was, she was more familiar with our beliefs and the workings of our principles than most of our students were, including the upperclassmen.  In her I found a kindred mind and a thirst for truth that rivaled my own.  We began to spend more time together.  I had often wondered in the beginning why she spent so much time here in the tower and not out with her friends, and then I realized it was because while she wanted more than anything else in the world to be a cleric of Marr, she had absolutely no talent for the profession.  No <em>magical</em> talent, that is, but she did have some magical ability, albeit only a smidgen, and of a different ilk, and in a year or two she was to be sent to Hargor's school of Wizardry as a novice.  Her thirst for learning, coupled with an intensely serious nature produced a girl who spent the next three months in the library with me.  She almost lived there.  But eventually she came less and less, and then there was a space of about eight months where I saw her not at all.  Then a brief visit to let me know that she was going on to the college of Wizardry under the Mastership of one Wizard Hargor.  The thread of the universe weaves patterns for us all, most different, but some lucky few get to follow the same path, or so they say.
<br><br>
	During the next two years I had visited three times, and even though I could tell that Hargor and his staff were disappointed in her lack of ability, in all other ways she was a model student and everyone loved her.  Lysinda had a very engaging personality that made it seem as if you had known her all your life after just talking to her for a little time.
<br><br>
	It was Lysinda who had introduced me to Hargor.
<br><br>
	It was Hargor who had killed her, I was fairly sure. . .
<br><br>
	We have not seen each other in months, but that last time we had a chance to speak at length together, she was not the happy, bouncing friend I remembered.  A girl who got excited over a new book or a breakthrough in a magical working for herself, a breakthrough most of her classmates had made a year gone, but she was instead preoccupied and a little worried to my eye.  She had spoken of odd visitors showing up at odd hours, snippets of conversation between Hargor and other people she didn't know broken off suddenly as she approached.  She had told me that she was sure something slightly. . . off center. . . was going on, but she couldn't put her finger on it, and there was once when she had seen Hargor in the company of certain famous swashbucklers that she knew had a hideout in the eastern Commonlands.  As I had already met t'Ceira and Darvinn by then, and had already started working on a way to get them to their dream, Lysinda had considered the appearance of the swashbucklers important.  She was sure Hargor had seen her spying on them that night, but he had said nothing.  I remember her last few words to me in the conversation.
<br><br>
	". . . he came right up to me and asked me how I liked my studies here, and was there anything he could do to make my stay more enjoyable, that I had caught his attention and he wanted to spend more time tutoring me on a personal basis.  But I didn't like his eyes.  They no longer have any soul in them."
<br><br>
	"Lysinda, is it possible you are imagining this?" I had asked, feeling uncomfortable that Hargor would be anything like what she described.
<br><br>
	"Maybe," she murmured, "but something feels wrong about all this."
<br><br>
	And, as I escorted her back to the school that night, I noticed an entourage of footmen at the steps of the school.  They carried a banner on which was a symbol that looked familiar but I couldn't  bring it to mind. I remember there was something about it that seemed somehow important.
<br><br>
	As I stood there dumbfounded, listening to Ranor tell me of Lysinda's death, it began to come together for me.  At once I remembered the symbol on the banner.  That of the Ambassador of Neriak.  I wondered what Hargor would possibly have to do with him!  Suddenly, I recalled the note I received late last night, while I was still preparing for my dawn trip to Hargor's school.  It came by messenger:  the third railway point was wanting to know where the people I had told them I was sending were.  They had never arrived, yet they had left Hargor's place a month ago.  They were two weeks overdue!
<br><br>
	As soon as the name "Lysinda" rolled off of Ranor's tongue, things began to fall together into a very ugly picture . . . the memories whirling through my mind were interrupted by the simple truth spoken by the youth barring my way into the school.
<br><br>
	". . . but what I can't understand is how that could have killed her so completely," Ranor said.  "maybe he will know more tonight when he returns to pick up more of his stuff."
<br><br>
	I came slowly back to myself.  "Uh. . . what?"
<br><br>
	"That spell Hargor said she was attempting.  With her level of power the backlash should only have stopped her heart, not blasted her to a cinder.  It doesn't add up."
<br><br>
	"What spell was it?"
<br><br>
	"Bolt of Frost."
<br><br>
	I like things to be a little ordered around me, especially my facts.  That's why I solve problems as fast as I can, because mysteries have unordered facts laying about, and unordered facts really get on my nerves.  And my nerves were really starting to feel gotten upon.  Bolt of Frost was a first order magical working that most students could do in their sleep, and I had agonized over it with Lysinda many times trying to help her learn to channel the energies.  She had told me of some who had failed the spell, and because of mismanagement of power, had suffered a back blast of energy, and Ranor was right: in worst case, <em>worst</em> case, one student had dropped dead from a failed heart.
<br><br>
	In Hargor's tower, there was more than just the odor of sulfur; there was also the stink of decay. . 
<br><br>
 	When the whirling of memories settled to a more manageable breeze, I choked out to the boy, Ranor,  "Where's the body?  I want to see it!"
<br><br>
	"It should be buried just about now, over in the cemetery."
<br><br>
	Thinking of the two people with shovels I had seen just moments before, I muttered to myself, "Maybe there's still time."  As I turned to leave I thought of something.  "Who else knows of this?"
<br><br>
	"Well, no one, yet.  Master Hargor told me that all the students left early this morning on a field trip to the western commons.  I guess they left before he did."
<br><br>
	"And why aren't you with them?  Are you being penalized again?  This is the third time this year!"
<br><br>
	Ranor blushed a pretty shade of pink.  "Actually, that's sorta true.  You see, early early this morning, before everyone left, I was leaving Kendra's room by the usual route, and while up there I happened to look down in the garden and see Hargor dragging what looked like a badly burned body from a side door.  I didn't want to call attention to myself, so I waited 'til this morning to ask him what was going on.  I guess I kinda' let it slip that I had seen him from the tree, and he got angry and put me on door duty.  Oh, well.  It's not so bad, though; Cook brought me some bread and cheese a few minutes ago, compliments of the Master, straight outa his personal stash."  He produced a piece of cheese and inhaled it to punctuate his statement.
<br><br>
	"Thanks, Ranor!"  I headed at a trot toward the side of the school where the graves were.  Ranor was well liked by many of the young ladies, and Kendra was a favorite of his.  I had constantly admonished him in the past about his habit of sneaking around to the backside of the school at night, because it was against the rules as the back of the facility is where the girls dorms were located.  He would climb out his window, crawl on the outer ledge around to the back, jump to the tree, and climb up to her third story window.  He got out the same way, usually unseen.  I shook my head at his antics as I arrived at the cemetery.
<br><br>
	There were only three grave markers, two for former high students who had been careless, and one for a teacher who had had a seizure of some sort during a casting.  Magic is dangerous in most cases and must be respected.  That is why I tend to not like it, magic of my order is so much easier to control, as the Gods would never give a devout worshiper more than they can chew, would they?  Of course not.
<br><br>
	As hoped, the two layabouts from Freeport had not yet begun to break the ground and were leaning on the shovels chuckling amongst themselves.  One had a pipe and was knocking it against the low stone wall of the little plot.
<br><br>
	"Ho!  Is she in the ground yet?" I called out.
<br><br>
	At the sound of my voice they looked up sheepishly at first, but as recognition dawned, their expressions turned stony.  "Gripes, Brel, this one follows us everywhere!" said the one without a pipe to his companion.  Brel stared at me with definite distaste in his mouth.  "Did ye come all the way from the friggin' city just to harp on us again, Miss High and Mighty?  We is hard at work, we is.  What ye be a'wantin'?" he whined out.
<br><br>
	I smiled tightly as I lifted up the tarp covering the body.  "I'm just here to see the girl's body, not make any judgments upon your degree of laziness, Brel."  I almost gagged from the overpowering smell of burned flesh.  After that all I could do was stand there and attempt to absorb the enormity of what I was seeing before me.
<br><br>
	It had once been a human being, but was almost unrecognizable as such now.  Steeling myself, I pulled the left hand free with a small crackling sound.  Keeping the bile down uneasily, I glanced at the fingers:  sure enough, there it was.  The ring her mother had given her for her twelve-day, now twisted and melted and blackened.
<br><br>
	I have seen burn victims before.  Part of our training involves a stint at some of the various hospices in the area, learning to recognize people's pains and feelings, and I knew for a fact that this was no Bolt of Frost spell gone wrong.  If Lysinda had been burned at all from the spell, which was very unlikely, she would have been burnt from the inside out, not from the outside in as this body had been.  No.  The very fact that she was burned outside at all spoke of foul play, by someone very powerful.
<br><br>
	I stepped away, the world spinning around me.
<br><br>
	"Return her to the arms of the earth where she belongs," I whispered.  I didn't care whether they heard me or not.  Everything was a blur as it all came crashing down on me at once.  I could feel it building quickly, like a sudden huge wave, getting stronger with each step away that I took.  I stumbled through the gate and toward a small copse of trees as the first tear weaseled out of my eye, and with that the floodgate was opened.
<br><br>
	Trees are so nice.  They stand there when you need something to lean on and they don't ask question.  They just kind of stand there and be strong for you.	
<br><br>
	Oh, Lysinda!  
<br><br>
	Hargor!  Was it possible?
<br><br>
	I had to know.  Had to see his face.  I would know then if he were lying.  I opened the note Ranor had given me from Hargor, the words blurred through my tears.  Without looking back I left the school, the stink of burned flesh, and the many memories behind beginning the long trek to the meeting place Hargor had mentioned in his note.
<br><br>
	The trip took me about three hours, and at it's completion I found myself back in Freeport, or I should say <em>under</em> Freeport, in the underground sewer system that most of the general populace either knew nothing about or avoided like the pits of Innoruuk.  Those who did know of it's existence knew that it was a place frequented by lowlifes, curmudgeons, hard-boiled men of ill repute, and even a foppish knave from time to time.  If you wanted anything questionable done, this was the place to make it happen.  The nice thing about the place was the miles of uncharted empty passages and junctions, and despite the bad element in the more crowded areas, we had set up a temporary safehouse at the junction of two passages, where travelers of the railroad could hole up for a day until the coast was clear for them to sneak onboard one of the ships in the nearby harbor.
<br><br>
	I knew there was trouble as soon as I entered the junction and saw the dead lookout on the floor.  The next heartbeat saw me fighting for my life as three black-cloaked shadows leapt from the other tunnel and set upon me with shortswords.  For the next two minutes all that could be heard were the grunts of our exertion and the whack of steel on toughened wood as I intercepted their blades on the haft of my scythe.  These guys were good, almost too good, but I knew that I was slightly better.  Not wanting to kill them, when I saw my opening, I took it.  WHACK to the head!  One went down under my blow.  That slowed them for a second, and the guy on the left looked at the guy on the right, and the guy on the right gave out with his speech that I related to you at the beginning of this part of the story about not letting me live or Hargor would be pissed, and again I took advantage of the stupid opening they gave me and down went the left assassin.  Spinning to face the remaining assassin, I brought my scythe up just in time as he attempted a slash at my unprotected right side, but to his dismay I was faster and caught his blade in the crook of my weapon where blade meets shaft, and disarmed him.  As his blade flew through the air, I brought mine down and behind his legs and swept him, which had the added effect of slicing both his hamstrings.  Such are the things that happen to bad people who don't know the truth of Mithaniel Marr.  I questioned him, but he preferred more to curse me, so after about ten minutes of this I whacked his melon, and then whacked the others again as they were showing signs of coming to, and dragged the lot of them to them to the surface and left them with the guards.  But the interview was not a total loss.  Between the man's foul cursings I learned that it was Hargor who had ordered them to kill me, and it was Hargor, horror upon horrors, who had been diverting the trains I had been sending him and taking all those beautiful beings and selling them into slavery and maybe even using some of them in his cruel spell researches.  I had also learned that he had had <em>special</em> plans for my dear friends Darvinn and t'Ceira Wrathchild.  So, with gut-wrenching worry on top of white-hot anger, and remembering what Ranor had said about Hargor returning for more of his stuff tonight, I decided it was time for Hargor to learn the higher truths of Mithaniel Marr at my hands.  I headed back to his tower.
<br><br>
	So now I sit, waiting. . .
<br><br>
	After about twenty minutes I heard footsteps scraping on the floor in front of the door.  As the door burst open and light flooded the room from a globe floating above his head, I was on my feet, weapon ready, as Hargor came into the room.  He stopped just briefly at seeing me there, his face impassive as usual, eyes piercing like ice daggers.  I just nodded affirmatively to him, too mad to speak, but I stayed my hand for need of hearing him speak the truth.
<br><br>
	He slowly entered and began circling to my left, glancing at his worktable behind him.  I took a step toward him and he stopped.  "So, you think you know something?"  He smiled a smile that sent an arrow of trepidation through me.  I knew I had no chance against him, for his mastery of Wizardry is great, but I reminded myself that I had something on my side that he didn't:  Truth.
<br><br>
	"Where are they?" I grunted through clenched teeth.
<br><br>
	He sent his glowing ball hovering to the vaulted ceiling as the room was suddenly lit by a flash of lightning followed by a growl of thunder.
<br><br>
	"Your two friends, that tempting dark elf and the nasty Ogre she thinks she loves?"  He raised an eyebrow in contempt.  "Oh, I sent them away, but not in the manner that they, or you, think."  He shook his head as if admonishing a child.  "He was not good enough for her, anyway," he muttered half to himself.  His eyes found mine and held, "Don't you see, my friend!  She deserves better!  She deserves one who will give her all her small mind needs and desires!  If she was not enamored with that oaf of unnatural flesh, she could be taught to see clearly!"  His voice held the ring of obsession as he spoke.
<br><br>
	Things clicked into place for me.  "Oh, and you are!?" I shouted.  I took another step toward him.  "What makes you think she will love you after this!?"
<br><br>
	Again, as if explaining to a child, "Since I have removed his influence from her, she will come around.  She won't be able to help it.  After all, they are lower forms of life.  They don't do or feel things in the manner we do.  They aren't as refined as we are in our emotions, they don't have the sensibilities that we do as higher beings, as humans.  Don't you see, Diane?  She will see that I can give her what a plain minded Ogre cannot!"
<br><br>
	"Is that the rational you used to convince yourself that it was ok to sell over thirty people in the three trains I sent you into a life of darkness?"  Another step.  "And what about Lysinda?  What was her crime?"
<br><br>
	"Oh, that poor dear.  Well, she saw something she shouldn't have," was his nonchalant answer.
<br><br>
	"She was on to you and you found out and removed her.  You killed her.  It was not accident."
<br><br>
	"You are very astute for a bumbling follower of a powerless god, you intriguing yet tiresome fool."
<br><br>
	"I am going to stop you, Hargor.  If not me, Darvinn or t'Ceira will."
<br><br>
	"Huh!  Those two can't even hold hands any more!  How rich!  They are separated by more than just distance. He in his home, and she has her greatest wish, to visit and learn of Neriak!  They can't touch! Not ever again, even if they do manage to find their way back to each other.  They are as air to each other.  The spell on them cannot be broken by any power that any of you will ever be able to comprehend or grasp within your insignificant lifetimes! She will soon come to me and thank me for unsaddling her from that male monstrosity.  And, I have allies, more than you can realize or understand.  I do not have time for this!  It is time for you to stop being tiresome and to be simply dead!"
<br><br>
	A red beam of light shot out of Hargor's chest as he threw his arms wide and hit me in the chest.  I immediately felt my strength drain to almost nothing.  I staggered forward, determined to get at least one blow in on him.  He laughed, and with a flick of his wrist a blue nimbus appeared to engulf him, and my blade simply bounced off of him with a teeth-jarring impact that almost made me lose consciousness.  Another flick of the wrist, and I went flying into the wall behind me, to slide to floor stunned.
<br><br>
	"Fool!  I am stronger than you can imagine!  What gall to think you can best me!"
<br><br>
	I managed to roll aside, avoiding the ball of fire that impacted the wall where I had been, and showering me with rock shards and powder.
<br><br>
	Not waiting for the smoke to clear, and feeling some of my strength return, I scrambled to my feet, and screaming out "Mithaniel Marr!  Smite him with your mighty arm!" I rushed Hargor with weapon raised.
<br><br>
	I never made it.  Another wrist-flick stopped me midstride.  I found myself floating, and then suddenly hurtling out the window into the maelstrom of the storm.  I was falling, falling, the world cartwheeling around me, for just a stomach-wrenching second, until the blade of my scythe caught and I held on for dear life.  I found myself hanging by my blade from the sill of a window on the second story.  And I was slipping.
<br><br>
	The thunder and wind picked up force suddenly, and as the rain finally let loose, I glanced up to see Hargor leaning out of his window, laughing at me.  "Here comes your deathblow, fool!  And die knowing that t'Ceira is mine!"
<br><br>
	I scrabbled for a hold on the sill but the stone was slick with rain.  Can't hold much longer.  Glancing up, I saw Hargor raising his hand for the final blow and I prepared myself for death.  Help me Marr, I prayed, and looked up to meet my death.  At that moment the heavens opened and a brilliantly blinding shaft of lightning crackled down from above and just barely licked Hargor's outstretched hand.  He didn't even yell, just jerked like a puppet with a madman on the strings and then he slumped on the sill above me.  Just for a second, then it was gone.  As I hung there precariously I heard Hargor call thinly, "It isn't over, Diane.  We will meet again. . . ."  Then the window in front of me opened and someone grabbed me and began pulling me in just as I was letting go to fall.
<br><br>
	"It's ok, Diane.  He teleported out just now.  You're ok," Ranor's voice said.
<br><br>
	As I lay on the floor thanking Marr for his help, for I was absolutely sure the lightning bolt had been his, I was sobered by the thought that Hargor had lived through it.  What power he must posses!  I know now, lying on that floor, that all of our futures had just gotten a bit more complicated.
<br><br>
	We will meet again.
<br><br>
	I am heading to find them, my friends who have become more than friends.  Their quest has become my own.  To find some way to break the curse or brake the Wizard!  I will not rest until Hargor's evil and lies have been rectified!
