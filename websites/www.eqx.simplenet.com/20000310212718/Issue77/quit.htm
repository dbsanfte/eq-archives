Time and again we have all heard that familiar refrain. "You can't tell me how to play this game!" A sentiment that is, at the core, completely correct. It is not our place as role players to tell someone they are wrong in how they approach a role playing game. In fact, some of my favorite role playing experiences have come about when someone simply decided 'join in'. In the parlance of role players every where, these are the people who finally get it. And it is a wonderful thing to see. Yet why is it that frequently the most vocal about screaming "don't tread on me" have no problem with the conundrum of telling me to stop playing my way?
<br><br>
Some people know me as the player with not enough time for all of his character ideas. There is the lovesick bard that follows Erollisi Mar. There is the pompous and righteous Erudite Paladin, or how about the Gnome travelling salesman turned Enchanter? Let's not forget the harmonious monk of Quellious. And how could we forget the loveable Troll shadow knight that in his heart of hearts wishes he was a bard, yet passionately loves his role as a champion of Innoruuk? All of these characters force me to use a distinct play-style when I play them. How this comes about is a separate article and concept, one I wish everyone at least could give a try once. What is urbane to this discussion is an encounter I had with Negak about a month ago. An encounter so jarring that I haven't played Negak since. In truth, I nearly gave up on EverQuest as a lost cause.
<br><br>
Negak likes to sing the type of rhymes you might hear on a kindergarten playground, if those children loved to smash things. He also engages what has been labeled as Troll Talk. In other words, he rhymes while spelling badly, usually while trying to smash something. It's what he loves to do. His two favorite pastimes combined in one glorious hymn to the All Father of Hate, Innoruuk.
<br><br>
Usually I get two reactions with this character, either indifference or true enjoyment. To me the best part of this game is getting a /tell from someone who has interacted with one of may character stating that it was a blast. In some ways it is an ego rush. In others, it's the knowledge that perhaps I've shown someone the power of this medium for the first time. On this day in particular though, I received a reaction that was disturbing to say the least.
<br><br>
Negak was merrily hunting away in the Karanas when he saw a well outfitted Ogre. Seeing a fellow follower of evil in this hostile place. Negak in his childlike excited way, rushed up to say hi. The response of the Ogre? "Shut up with that dumb talk. I hate it!" Understanding that some may not wish to play my way, I moved along. A very short time later, Negak was merrily bashing away at something while singing the praises of Innoruuk and the joy of smashing Halflings (it's one of his favorite refrains). Imagine my surprise when I received a /tell from the Ogre. Apparently he had stuck around and overheard my song. To sum up, he used some interesting vocabulary comparing me to a child molester, Hitler and promised to petition me to save Norrath from my obvious deviant tendencies. I was shocked to put it mildly. The fact that the person then put me on /ignore when I tried to talk to them only increased the ignobility of the situation. 
<br><br>
Well, obviously I haven't quit EverQuest because of this, and I have yet to hear from a GM banning me. On the other hand, I have not been able to bring myself to play Negak since. To have my gaming immersion shattered so completely, utterly, and with such violent finality, I haven't been able to get over the taste this left in my mouth. 
<br><br>
So why am I talking about this? I guess it is to ask people to think before they react. It is obvious this person knew nothing about role play nor had ever bothered to try to figure out what I was about. They simply assumed I was some sort of a freak and exploded. No, I don't expect everyone to role play, but I shouldn't have to be fearful of role playing in a role playing game. Both sides of the do/don't role play need to at the very least try to understand where the other side is coming from. I shouldn't have to worry about people's reaction to my in character statements, but I do.
<br><br>
The truly humorous thing about all of this is that I was once a power gamer. In some ways I still am. I know what the best weapon stats and spells are. However, I have found that I get much more enjoyment out of these games if I go for immersion instead of tweaking the rules. I don't expect everyone to understand this. I don't really expect everyone to care. But I should be able to expect people to give the good old 'College Try' to see where I am coming from. In short, practice what you preach. I cannot nor have I the right to change how you play the game. Then again, neither do you. Keep this in mind as you travel Norrath, for some of the freaks may just be average working stiffs trying to have a bit of fun.
