What's this?  Letters?  Why would Moogie leave these things on her desk?  Maybe she's waiting for someone to read them to her.  I don't think she can read on her own.  Not that she's not smart.  She's real smart, for a Troll.  Not that Trolls aren't smart.  They just aren't smart like we think of smart, you know, with lots of thinking and stuff.  They're smart when it comes to beating people up, mostly.  Moogie beats people up all the time.  She doesn't mean to, really.  She's usually just trying to hug them or thank them.  We have to have a healer follower her around at her birthday parties after the gifts are given.  We all like Auntie Moog a lot.  She's been gone for a while now though, so maybe I should help her out.  She'd like that.  She would thank me for it later.

<br><br>
Well, I'll just tell her that Absor did it.
<br><br>
I'm having trouble reading some of these.  Trolls DO write!  They just don't do it so well.  Maybe I should go out and teach them to write right.  They could even go to school with the kids in Ak'Anon!  That would be great!  We would have to widen the halls and doors a bit.  And raise the roof.  But the mechanicals are always looking for something to do.  That would be great!  And the Trolls would be so happy!
<br><br>

<br><br>
Maybe I should just get to answering some of these letters.

<em>Dear Auntie <strike>Moog</strike> Mundas,
<br><br>
Week after week I keep seeing these ogres and trolls asking for advice in going after elf women. What possesses them to pursue wafer-thin females when they have big beefy examples of femininity at home? Could you provide some insight into this?
<br><br>
And of course, you being a woman, I'd also ask your opinion on why a troll woman would bother pursuing a gnome such as myself. (Granted, this happened some time ago, but it's been in the back of my mind ever since.) Is it because all your troll men are off chasing elven maidens in Faydark? What *is* it with all this cross-culture courting?

I think that Ogres and Trolls are a lot more friendly than people think.  They are always looking for people to hug and pat on the head.  Or maybe it's just me.  I dunno.  I mean, I met this Ogre once.  His name was Mongo.  That's a nice name.  Short enough so that an Ogre can remember it, and with a couple of ooooos in it.  When an Ogre says the oooo sound their voices get really deep, and it makes my belly shake.  It kinda tickles.  Not like a feather tickles, but different.  Not that I've ever seen an Ogre with a feather.  I have seem some bird men that had feathers.  They walk around in the ButcherBlock mountains.  They're very proud looking people.  They scare me a little bit.  And I suppose that I wouldn't want one tickling me with a feather.  Not that I imagine they'd pluck one from themselves just to tickle me.  But then I suppose they fall off once in a while.  I wonder if bird men molt?  That's an interesting question.  Hey, there's that smart Archy guy, I'll go ask him if they molt.
<br><br>
...
<br><br>

<br><br>
I wonder what 'tar and feather' means?  I wonder if it would tickle.  It certainly could, since it involves feathers.  But the tar part makes me wonder.  Maybe he was using that sarcasm kind of talk that people always say that he uses.  I'm not sure what it is myself.  I know that they say that I ramble a lot when I talk.  I don't know if that's true.  I mean, I like to talk.  And I know a lot of stuff.  I went to the College of Mechademia in Ak'Anon for three years!  I was so good at talking that they told me I graduated a year early just so I could go talk to people besides the teachers!  One of them suggested that I go talk to a Minotaur.  We have one of those in our zoo, you know.  BIG!  They're really big!  Not as big as an Ogre.  I wonder it a Minotaur would make me tickle when he says oooooo?  It's too far to the zoo from here, though.  I'll have to make a trip to visit the zoo soon.  I can see all the animals and my teachers.  Not that my teachers are in the zoo.  That's not what I meant.  I meant that I could visit them after the zoo.  Well, I might see them in the zoo.  After all, they study life, just like me!  So they might be in the zoo right now, seeing if the Minotaur makes their bellies tickle when they say ooooo.
<br><br>
Hehe!  I even tickle myself a little when I say oooo a lot.  But the guys at the other desks are telling me to stop that.  They are trying to work.  I suppose I must be tickling their bellies with my ooooo.  It's hard to work when your belly is being tickled.  Hey, this is kinda fun.  Now I know why Moogie is always sitting at this desk hugging her quills and stuff until they break.
<br><br>
...
<br><br>
...
<br><br>
Whew, sorry, I had to take a break.  I got thirsty.  But I'm better now.  Not that I was bad.  I didn't mean bad like mean bad.  I meant...  well I meant that I was thirsty that's all.  I had a tickle in the back of my throat, so I got some water.  That got rid of the tickle.  Hey, I wonder...  If water got rid of the tickle in my throat, I wonder if it would take the tickle out of a feather?  I always wonder about these things.  It's my job.  Well, part of my job.  My real job is to learn about life so that I can help make better mechanicals.  But I have more than one job.  Like finding out about tickles.  I need a feather.
<br><br>
...
<br><br>
...
<br><br>
I looked all over and couldn't find a feather.  Wait!  This quill is a feather!  It's a pen on one end and a feather on the other!  How cleaver!  Now, I need to make sure that it tickles, so that I can see if water removes the tickle.
<br><br>
...
<br><br>
...
<br><br>
It sure tickled Lrets.  He's laughing real hard now!  Now I gotta see if the water will stop the tickle.
<br><br>
...
<br><br>
...
<br><br>
<em>[Ed. - *sighs*  -  Well, Mundas managed to ruin all of the other letters with all the water.  I'm not going to be the one that explains this mess to Moogie.  Maybe when Lrets finally catches the little fellow we'll talk to him about that.  For now, I guess we'll have to elevate him to the status of Guest Auntie for the week...]</em>
