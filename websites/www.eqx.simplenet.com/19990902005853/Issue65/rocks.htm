Alicynn realized at a rather young age that appearances are everything.  This knowledge came quick to her, for she was an ugly duckling.
<br><br>
"You must not listen to what those wicked children say," Alicynn's mother would admonish.  "They are jealous of your inner beauty, and it is they who are truly poor."
<br><br>
Such long-tongued speech might have been nonsense to a typical five year old girl, but the Erudites were a sharp bunch, even in youth.  This is not to say that enlightenment came at early ages, however.  Every living thing starts out as a child, and behaves as such through play, emotion, and cruelty.
<br><br>
Alicynn's face was not proportioned like a pretty face would be, with her hair a bit too frayed, her chin a bit too large, and her neck a bit too long.  It was these aspects that her classmates at the Erudin Academy were all too eager to point out to her.  "Fairies built a nest in your hair again, Ali!!"  "You'd be pretty if you were an orc!" "Gnoll gneck!!"  Greater intelligence didn't stem the predatorial nature of Erudin children, no matter how evolved the Erudites claimed to be.  And why should it?  The Erudites prided themselves on their superiority over other races, how could they not want superiority over one another as well?
<br><br>
A taboo attached itself to Alicynn, and even those children who pitied her avoided her, for fear of catching stray insults like stray arrows in a fight.  She had no friends.  Sacrifice was something the children did not understand.  Neither did Alicynn.  All that she learned was that perhaps if there was someone uglier than she, she would not be the brunt of the jokes any longer.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
One evening, Alicynn's father was to leave the city for one reason or another.  He was a magician, and they traveled all the time. Alicynn knew little about his job other than that he "made" things.  But before he left, Alicynn heard a knock at her bedroom door, which opened immediately afterwards.  Alicynn's father stepped into the room, smiling down at his daughter who was wrapped snugly in a cocoon of blankets on her bed.
<br><br>
"Alicynn... I've brought you something very special for while I am gone," he said.  Alicynn's eyes lit up in anticipation.  Gifts are always mystical to children.
<br><br>
"What is it?" she asked, sitting up.
<br><br>
"A friend," he answered, and looked back to the door.  Alicynn gasped in delight.  She was going to have a friend?!
<br><br>
There was a quiet plodding as a very short, stout figure plodded into the room.  Alicynn narrowed her eyes in the dim light to try and make out it's features, only to realize that it had none.  The scent of rainwashed stone filled the room.
<br><br>
HELLO ALICYNN, came it's deep and not quite natural voice.
<br><br>
It was roughly humanoid in shape, possessing two arms and legs and a bulge where a head might have been.  But it couldn't have been more than 3 feet tall.  Alicynn reached out to touch it, and her fingers caressed cold, dusty stone.
<br><br>
Her heart sank in her chest.  Alicynn didn't quite know what they were, but she knew that her father made them.  If he'd been a carpenter, he might as well have made her a toy soldier and called it a friend, or a wooden pony.  It wasn't a friend, it was a walking rock.
<br><br>
"Thank you," she whispered, turning her face away in shame and sadness.  She'd never felt so pathetic in her entire 5 years of life, or at least the 3 that she could remember.
<br><br>
Her father kissed her cheek and hurried out of the room, late for whatever he was leaving for.  Alicynn began crying the moment her door closed.
<br><br>
The small earthen elemental plodded closer to the head of her bed.
<br><br>
ARE YOU IN PAIN, it intoned in it's flat and seemingly emotionless voice.
<br><br>
"No.  Go away."
<br><br>
 I AM TO STAY WITH YOU.
<br><br>
"I don't want you!!" she shouted, quickly catching herself for fear her parents might hear.  But they didn't, they had already left for the docks.
<br><br>
BUT WHY?  I AM YOUR FRIEND NOW.  It's voice seemed so very apathetic, like it had no choice in the matter.  It's hard to sound like anything else in a monotone.
<br><br>
"Why should I?" she whispered.  "Why should you care?  You're just a pile of rocks."
<br><br>
I AM TO WATCH OVER YOU.
<br><br>
Alicynn's mouth opened to answer before the answer had formulated there.  It closed as Alicynn gradually understood.  It was a babysitter.  Additional protection in her father's absence.  She turned her face back into the pillow and cried, ignoring the elemental's further inquiries.
<br><br>
<p style="text-align: justify">
Few days went by that Alicynn didn't express her discontent with the stone guardian which followed her like a puppy, both to her mother and to the elemental itself.  But the elemental never replied to her harsh words, and her mother only admonished, "You must not say such wicked things, for you're acting jealous of his inner beauty, and that will make you truly poor."
<br><br>
Alicynn resigned herself.  If the elemental had any inner beauty, it certainly couldn't express it very well.  But it stayed by her side constantly, save for when it's broad arms smacked into a tree or encroaching wall.  It seemed quite clumsy, and Alicynn took to calling it "Bumpy".
<br><br>
A few days later, when Alicynn finally returned to school, she feared what would happen.  She'd be mocked for having a rock for a pet, or perhaps earn another scalding nickname, or some other unspeakable child-worthy torture.
<br><br>
"What is -that-?" one of her many nameless tormenters barked from across the courtyard in front of the children's academy as she approached it.
<br><br>
She glared back at him without stopping her hurried walk, and shouted back, "Bumpy."
<br><br>
The children began to descend upon them.  Not so much upon them, but it.
<br><br>
"Bumpy?!" one asked incredulously.
<br><br>
The elemental had snatched the name the moment it had heard it, as they are born nameless.  And one name is as good as another, so long as it's given.  Though Alicynn and the children couldn't know it, Bumpy was filled with pride, and stood as tall as he could, stating, YES, THAT IS MY NAME.
<br><br>
Almost simultaneously all the children laughed.  "What a dumb name!!!"  "Yeah, and my name is Dumpy!"  "He sure looks like he's bumpy!!"
<br><br>
Alicynn cringed at first, not realizing that suddenly she was not the focus of attention and malevolence.  Bumpy was.
<br><br>
Jeers and insults and pokes and shoves came from every direction, although none seemed to affect the small elemental, which turned to and fro, somewhat confused.  He couldn't feel the pokes and shoves, Alicynn could tell.  As for the jeers and insults, she figured they couldn't be affecting it either.  Why should he care?  He was just a pile of rocks.
<br><br>
Besides, for the first time, she wasn't being laughed at.  She smiled as much as she dared.  Bumpy stood still and silent until the children finally filed into the school at the sound of the bell tower.  He then dutifully followed Alicynn into the building, who didn't give him a second glance.  Sacrifice was something she didn't understand.
<br><br>
<p style="text-align: justify">
The next few weeks were similar.  Bumpy drew jeers and insults wherever he was from the children, most of whom didn't know what he was, therefore labeling him a freak-thing.  And Alicynn enjoyed a certain peace, a hollow peace.  She couldn't quite tell what it was that tainted this time of her life which seemed so wonderful, so painless compared to her previous existance.  But she was no longer the ugliest, the funniest looking.  That was something, wasn't it?
<br><br>
"Tommorrow is ValorTime's day," the teacher explained as classes drew to a close.  "We celebrate Valor, Sacrifice and Love among one another by giving a gift to those who are important to us.  Nothing fancy, now."
<br><br>
Most of the children glanced among one another in confusion.  They had celebrated ValorTime's day before, but never had it been explained to them.  It was just another chance to get gifts.  Valor was beating up a goblin, they knew that.  Love was what their parents did.  And Sacrifice was... well, they didn't know.
<br><br>
But the illumination only slowed them a bit when the bell rang and they flew out the door and away from their schooling.  Alicynn followed slowly, her mind a blank, still contemplating what was wrong in her mind that seemed even more compelling after the Teacher's announcement.  Bumpy walked evenly behind her, still shielding her from the harsh words that would otherwise have stricken her.
<br><br>
That night she strung together a series of colored goblin beads onto a thread in a semblance of a necklace.  Beads were plentiful as many adventurers sold them to vendors throughout the city, and after being painted and polished, could be made quite pretty.  Alicynn thought it was a good gift, but couldn't think of anyone to give it to.  She decided that she would give it in return to the child who gave her a gift the next day.
<br><br>
She slept soundly, Bumpy standing silently by her bed.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
ValorTime's day was marked by ribbons and banners throughout the school and city.  No real teaching took place throughout the day, there were mostly parties and such in most of the classrooms and the children were allowed to wander about.  Bumpy attracted many shouts and irate comments as he frequently stumbled into, or was stumbled into by passing children and teachers in the crowded halls.  Near the end of the day, the children convened in their respective classrooms and gift giving time was announced.
<br><br>
Homemade cards, barrettes, wooden toys and candies were swapped from hand to grubby hand.  Insincere blessings of "Happy ValorTime's Day" sometimes preceded an exchange, but more often items were grabbed and hurriedly eaten or stashed away.
<br><br>
Alicynn sat patiently waiting for a gift, a paper, a kind word to be given to her, her string of beads clutched tightly in her hands, eager to give it away.  But nobody approached her.  And in short order, the exchanges were nearly complete, and children were making their way out the door with their newfound and hollow treasures.
<br><br>
Hollow.  It finally occurred to her.  The poison which had seeped into her peace for the last few days was a fact: She wasn't at peace.  She was simply alone.  For all the horrific taunting and pain she'd endured at the hands of her peers, she was no better off now, for like before, she was still friendless.  She was still ugly.  And now she was even worse, for in addition to being friendless, she was just as bad as those who were so malevolent or cowardly to attack or ignore Bumpy-
<br><br>
ALICYNN?
<br><br>
Her jaw was hanging open, her eyes wide as she began her descent into despair once more, when the deep voice caused her to start and look down.
<br><br>
Bumpy was standing before her.  A small daisy had grown, apparently only in the last few minutes, from the earthen top of his head.  A stony arm reached up and plucked it between two thick, stony fingers, and then extended towards Alicynn's lap-resting hands.
<br><br>
HAPPY VALORTIME'S DAY.
<br><br>
His voice, still monotone, deep, and steady, sounded different to Alicynn.  Not because it had changed, but because only now was she able to hear the honesty, and the spirit inside the stone body, more authentic than any words she'd heard since the day her father kissed her goodnight in her room.
<br><br>
The beads fell from her hands and she ran out the door.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
It was nearly a half hour later when she collapsed, crying, in the forest surrounding the city.  The daisy was still in her fingers.  How could she have been so selfish?  So cruel?  How could she become like all the others that she hated so viciously, and ignore the one being that cared about her?
<br><br>
"There there.  It'll all be over soon."
<br><br>
She looked up, startled.  A tall woman was standing before her.  Beside the woman was an equally tall skeleton gripping a wicked-looking mace.
<br><br>
Alicynn shrieked and shrank back.  "Wh...wh.. w-wh..." she stammered.
<br><br>
"Who am I?  Or what is he?  Or where are you?" the woman spoke in angled tones.  "I can't tell what you're trying to ask, I'm afraid...  Besides, I think you know who I am, and what he is."
<br><br>
The Necromancers had a hall hidden in the forest near the city, for they were not tolerated within.  No surprise, as they looked upon killing people in the same way that most people looked upon hugging people, like it was a courtesy.  And that was exactly how this woman was looking upon Alicynn.
<br><br>
The woman licked her lips.  "It's been so very long since I've freed such a young soul into ultimate peace..." she murmured, her eyes showing a perverse excitement.  With a sidelong glance, the skeleton began towards Alicynn, mindless murder evident in it's bony grin.
<br><br>
A thumping noise came approaching behind her, and suddenly Alicynn's view from the ground was blocked by brown stone.
<br><br>
I AM SORRY, BUT I CANNOT ALLOW YOU TO HARM ALICYNN.
<br><br>
Alicynn gasped, as an even greater fear clutched her heart.  "Bumpy, no!!!"
<br><br>
There was the crunching sound of breaking stone, followed by the crunching sound of breaking bone, followed by a startled shriek.  Alicynn rolled to one side to see what was happening.  The necromancer was fleeing into the forest.  Bumpy had his long arms wrapped around the Skeleton's pelvis, and the Skeleton was flailing wildly with it's mace at Bumpy's back.  Chips of stone flew from his body, and snaps repeated themselves as the Skeleton's body was crushed in Bumpy's strong arms.
<br><br>
Alicynn began screaming.  She covered her head as a bone, or rock, was flung from the melee and struck her face.  She was left with only sounds, the brainless cackle of the Skeleton combined with the horrid crunching noises of the battle.  Minutes later, there was finally silence.
<br><br>
She looked up.  Nothing recognizable remained of the Skeleton's lower half but powder and chips.  It's arms, ribcage, and skull were scattered about, mercifully bereft of animation.
<br><br>
She sucked in her breath as she saw the large stone heap that remained of Bumpy nearby.  His arms were gone, or least unrecognizable.  His legs were gone.  The largest remaining piece looked to be his body.  Alicynn jumped to it and wrapped her arms around it, feeling it quiver slightly beside her.
<br><br>
His voice came.  It was quieter, more distant, but strong as it had always been, coming from beyond his body.
<br><br>
I HAVE TO GO NOW, ALICYNN.
<br><br>
Alicynn began to cry.  "No... please don't.  Bumpy, please don't..."
<br><br>
IT'S OKAY, ALICYNN.  YOU ARE SAFE NOW...
<br><br>
She opened her tear-filled eyes and looked at the earthen spot where the daisy had grown, feeling it to be the closest to his face as she could muster.  She gently brushed her fingers over the dusty surface.  "I'm sorry, Bumpy.  I'm so sorry for how I treated you... I-I never knew..."
<br><br>
The voice began fading away, but she heard every last word.  There was happiness in them.
<br><br>
DON'T CRY, ALICYNN.  I WAS ABLE TO PROTECT YOU.  I'M THANKFUL FOR THAT.  A GOOD LIFE… FOR A PILE… OF….. ROCKS……...
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
Alicynn studied magery with her father from that day forth.  She asked for a gift; an enchantment, to be placed upon the daisy, that it might never wilt.  To this day she still has it, and carries it with her everywhere upon her beaded necklace.
<br><br>
Every time she summons an elemental, she asks if they knew Bumpy.  She hopes beyond hope that perhaps someday, she will summon Bumpy to life once more.  Though she grew into a beautiful woman, she lives for the day that she is at last reunited with her one true friend.
<br><br>
Until then, sacrifice is something that she understands.
