That is a default mechanism inside Windows to allow you to escape out of any
program in any situation, and hopefully without causing any more problems.
In fact, it is something a kin to the CTRL-ALT-DEL and 'end program' way of
ending a program, except you just exit it usually, similar to ALT-TAB.
<br><br>
Tried to do a little research on it before I sent this off, but from what I
can tell, there isn't a way to disable it.  Unfortunately that means that
unless Verant allows you to re-map your straff key anytime soon, the best
course of action really is, "Try not to use those keys".
<br><br>
Hopefully this will shed some light on the problem for ya.

As a RPGer of 10 years (sr yr of HS & beyond), who in fact met her 2nd
husband via a fellow gamer, I don't mind being considered "odd".  My husband
has been playing D&D since the first printing - he's 32 now.  And most of
our group has been playing since their mid-teens as well, and they are in
their mid-to-late 20's now.  Nearly all of my friends were either directly
from RPG's or indirectly via the internet/BBs (and played RPGs). For an
average investment of $21 a month, I'll gladly take the hours of
entertainment provided by RPGs vs a 2-hr movie that costs a min. of $14 per
show for the 2 of us - with little to no ppl interaction.  And for all those
nay-sayers of us gamers, if you check with most gamers, they are avid
readers, have decent-to-excellent vocabularies (from the reading) and tend
to be a bit more open-minded about difference peoples & cultures - though
this last varies greatly.  And my current group has been together in one
incarnation or another for over 5 years. So for those that think we should
grow up - I say give me $50 a month or butt out :-)

When I was reading Tales of Truth part one, written by Taean, it gave me the
shivers. I must say that I really like that story and Im looking forward to
the next part. Thank you for a great site, you are doing a great job.

This is in response to Argonax's letter to the editor posted in issue
91. Argonax seems to have had enough Aklar's 'A Tail of Trechery'.  I
have not. Aklar is one of the best, or perhaps the best authors
contributing to EQX. I look forward to every installment. Aklar, please
don't stop now!

What happened to the Rogue and Neren articles?  I have been following
the Rogue article since the beginning and now there is an issue without
one.  Egad.  This can not be.  Please say it is not so.

Okay, I've had it.  I've been reading EQX for what seems like forever, and
this just takes the cake.  Y'know Auntie Moog was bad enough, but I mean
COME ON.  I got way too many weird looks from my coworkers here as I was
laughing my a$$ off reading the er...long winded essay by Mr. Mundas, and
I'm not going to tolerate it!  It isn't fair, and if I get fired I'll sue!
Really!

Still laughing,

Please, please, PLEASE tell me that the dear and talented Aklar is taking a
much deserved, but short vaction from 'Rogue: A Tale of Treachery'.  He is the
reason I started reading your e-zine, and though i enjoy the rest of the
articles.. Aklar's writtings have become part of my Saturday morning routine. 
My laptop, a cup of coffee and the cool, damp, bird song infused morning on the
deck; and Kinny.  I can't tell you how horrified I was... 
<br><br>
Aklar's writting is beyond brilliant, (no offense is intended to our troll
friend in Kelethin.)  Please tell me he is coming back or I may have to jump
off the deck, right after my rogue friend, Banter, throws herself from the
highest platform in Kelethin.

P.S. I would be willing to give monetary support to this project if that would
rectify the story's absence.

Alan,
<br><br>
I was just referred to this website by a fellow EQ addict, and your's was
the first bio I read.  What a delight to find another RQ worshipper!  It was
the first RPG I ever played and it is still, in my opinion, the best.  Oh,
and you aren't the only person who hasn't played UO <grin>.
<br><br>
My life has been taken over by EQ, somewhat impairing my ability to earn a
living as a freelance writer, but I'm sure I'll get it under control... one
of these days... no, really... I mean it!
