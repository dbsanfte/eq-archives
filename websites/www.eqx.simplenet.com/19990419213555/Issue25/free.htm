Hail fellow EQX'naunts.  
<br><br>
I would first like to start by saying some of you will not get the jest of
this article.  Actually to those who don't, thanks for contributing to the
punch line, and my free entertainment.

It's about seven o'clock on Thursday night.  My son and I are engaged in a
heated, I mean heated, battle of Unreal.  After I hit the twenty five frag
limit for the fifth time in a row, my son complained that thirty-two
megabytes isn't enough memory in his machine {sigh} <em>(I think back to the
day when I was his age my computer had about 128 k of memory)</em>.  I admit that
my machine was getting much better frame rates at sixty four megabyte, having
less hard drive hits to slow it down <em>(Unreal appears to use a huge swap file
during play)</em>.

 Fearing that he might quite playing Unreal with me <em>(it's the only 3d shooter
 I'm able to beat him at)</em>, I decided to run him down to the local computer
 superstore.   I will refrain from using a store name as one of my last
 articles implicating Radio Shack brought me some grief.  God forbid I
 might let something slip like Tandy was the worst computer ever made,
 or RS's prices are a complete RIPOFF in the computer department.  So in
 order to prevent me from saying those things I'll not mention any company
 names.   No I'm just joking.  Radio Shack sells quality computer systems
 <em>{laughter}.</em>
