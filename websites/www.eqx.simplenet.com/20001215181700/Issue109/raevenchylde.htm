<p style="text-align: justify">
As I sit in the library sifting through the various arcane tomes stored here, I cannot help but remember my childhood. Educated here in this musty temple of books in the center of the Isle of Odus, I often wondered what life was like outside the walls of the city. I would spend many long hours musing on meeting new people of all shapes and sizes, and adventuring around this world that my elders seemed to be so prejudiced against. Reflecting on how I was then has spawned in me the need to tell the world my views on life and recount all the things that I have encountered in my numerous travels. This will be my mark on society, however small.

	I spent most of my childhood on the Isle of  Odus learning the arcane arts, as any good child of Erud should. My days were filled with cantrips and incantations, and I learned of all forms of magic. I was pressured constantly by my elders to pick a school of thought. I tried my best to learn a little of everything, but when I accidentally vaporized half the plants in the solarium during one of my many experiments, my headmaster gleefully exclaimed, "She's a natural born Wizard!" and proceeded to extinguish the small blazes that had erupted in the zinnias.
<br><br>
My parents were at first exasperated (Some of those plants were quite rare), but after they reimbursed the school, they were overjoyed that I was to be inducted into the academy.  My studies went well and I learned very quickly how to channel my energies into a focused and controlled outcome.   

<br><br>
	Not too long after I entered the academy, my brother Gulinast was inducted as well. He showed a natural talent for the arts as I did, but with a slight twist. It seems he had a knack for beguiling and deception. He would often convince mother somehow that the robes and jewelry that he had been asking for were crucial for his survival. He acquired many a fine piece in this fashion, and garnered many the profit heavy deals at the marketplace. Soon we understood that he would fit well with the rest of the enchanters in the academy. 
<br><br>
	So confident was he in his craft that he deemed education boring and cumbersome. He would often disguise himself as various objects to escape the endeavors of the classroom to venture alone in Toxxulia Forest. I often worried about his welfare in the wood, as I knew as well as anyone else that there were heretics and poachers roaming the mists. I also wondered exactly what he did out there all day.
<br><br>
	One day my curiosity got the best of me and I just had to follow him.  I watched him leave the house and walk in the direction of the palace, but as he walked around the corner I lost him.  I walked on a bit further full well expecting to see him walking onto the teleporter into the palace for a change, as if there were some chance that a sense of duty had crept into that brash skull of his.  I saw several of my classmates milling around practicing their divination and abjuration, but no Gulinast. I still had time before classes began, and therefore time to back out, but on a whim I decided to go the other direction.
<br><br>
	I turned around and walked towards the exit to the forest. The sentinels stomped stolidly past me on their rounds. As always they seemed indifferent to me, walking by as if I didn't even exist.  I proceeded past the library and into the cave leading out. I eventually came to the teleporter leading out. Once I got there I looked over the edge in sheer awe of the drop. Tension filled my chest as I looked down at the entrance to the wood and recounted the many times I had been told by my parents not to venture there alone.
<br><br>
"I'm not alone", I thought, "Gulinast will be there."

<br><br>
	I looked over the edge one more time to get my courage up. Just as I was turning around towards the teleporter, a booming voice filled the cavern.
<br><br>

"Ammudana! What are you doing here??"
<br><br>
	I nearly fell over the edge I was so startled. My heart raced as I turned around to see Gulinast laughing hysterically. 
<br><br>
"I thought you were the headmaster come to tear my heart out for missing class!" I said scowling at my brother. "Where did you go? I lost you at the palace."
<br><br>
"You are always worried about the headmaster. Why can't you see that those classes are useless?" he said with the usual smirk in his voice. "I have found something much more educational. Not to mention entertaining."

<br><br>
	With this he stepped onto the large azure gem and disappeared. I looked back once again toward town and the classes that I valued so well.  With leaden feet I advanced toward the gem and stepped on. 
<br><br>
	When I materialized on the other side Gulinast was standing before me tapping his foot impatiently.
<br><br>
"What took so long?" 
<br><br>
	I just frowned at him and said "Lead on oh great and wise teacher of truancy."
<br><br>
"You better believe it." 
<br><br>
	With that, he led me down the stone corridor to the forest. I could smell the dankness if the mist that covered the forest before it was even visible. It was like a stagnant pool made animate by some spiteful enchanter. We walked down the dark corridor until we saw the mist creeping in from the gaping maw in the side of the sheer rock face that served as the wall to the city of Erudin. The stone canopy that covered the entry was faintly visible above us. I saw the sun filtered through that sickly green mist and shuddered at the thought of what would lie beyond. I glanced briefly at my partner in crime to see that he was no less chipper than he had ever been.  With a certain degree of trepidation, I followed him into the forest. We passed several small houses and soon saw no signs of civilization. 
<br><br>
	Snakes and bugs crawled everywhere. Some of the fire beetles seemed even larger than I had first imagined. The various hissing and popping around me was somewhat disturbing and exciting at the same time. This was an adventure that I had not been planning to have for quite some time.
<br><br>
	My brother led me through several twists and turns until we came upon a river running through the center of the forest. At this point he reached into his backpack and produced a small cylinder.
<br><br>
"What is that?" I queried as he fiddled with a small protrusion on the cylinder.
<br><br>
As I said this, the cylinder suddenly clattered and expanded rapidly growing to close to ten times its original length.
<br><br>
 "It's a fishing pole!" he proclaimed proudly as he attached the line to the end of this odd device.
<br><br>
"Where in the world did you get that?"
<br><br>
"I found it lying here by the river. It wasn't in the best of shape, but I thought it was rather neat."
<br><br>
He then baited his hook and cast the line into the water. 
<br><br>
"Is this what you do here every day instead of attending class?" I said. I was becoming quite upset that I had skipped class to watch my little brother's fishing endeavors.
<br><br>
Just as I was ready to clobber my irresponsible sibling for distracting me from my studies, I heard a haunting howl from behind me.
<br><br>
"What was that?" 
<br><br>
"Probably a runt," said Gulinast nonchalantly. "They don't usually come over this far. Nothing to worry about."
<br><br>
"It sounded awfully close."
<br><br>
"Stop worrying, we'll be fine.  Now Hush, I need to concentrate," he said as he pulled what looked like tiny daggers out of his wrist pouch.  He took these in his hand and began to cast a spell. A humming sound permeated the air and then a rushing whoosh as his spell ended. Before me stood the result of his casting. Like all the other animations I had seen, it was just an axe and a shield animated to seem as though a person was wielding them 
<br><br>
"When did you learn that?" I said in mild astonishment. "Some of the older students haven't even been able to animate yet."
<br><br>
"All of us can do it, just not all of us are smart enough to find the components without the headmaster handing them to us." He said smugly. He then handed the fishing pole to the animation. The animation seemed almost bored. It paced back and forth along the riverbank dragging the line attached to the pole in the water. I was dumbstruck by just how lazy my brother could be. 
<br><br>
	Suddenly, the animation turned around and bolted into the woods. It didn't go very far before it started flailing the fishing pole madly about. I heard yelping and screaming coming from the other side of the trees and just knew that there would be a kobold on the other side.
<br><br>
	"He's a loud one." Gulinast said as he began to cast another spell. Lights danced about the kobold's entire body as my brother ended his incantation. The poor beast seemed to quit breathing for a bit and convulsed on the ground as the animation beat it about the head and neck with the fishing pole. I heard a loud crunch as the fishing pole hit home one last time and sunk nearly a quarter inch into the hairy fiend's skull. The kobold finally resumed breathing only long enough to let loose a wheezing gasp that was its final breath.
<br><br>
	It had occurred to me in the past that an enchanter's animations were created for the purpose of self defense, but it had never crossed my mind just how brutal that defense would be.  I watched Gulinast examine his animation. 
<br><br>
"He did well, don't you think?" 
<br><br>
"I don't quite know what to think," I said. 
<br><br>
"I told you it was more educational out here. I use my skills more frequently and I learn something new every time. For instance, I learned that Kobolds carry cash."
<br><br>
	He then walked over to the corpse, removed a small belt pouch from around the waist of the deceased animal, and shook out a few coins. 
<br><br> 
"It's not much, but it's enough to convince Jeros to take notes for me and tell me what to brush up on that I miss."


<br><br>
	As Gulinast was examining his findings, there was another earsplitting howl from the depths of the wood. Several more howls followed in turn until the forest was alive with the screaming of the hound like kobolds. I looked up quickly as another beast roughly twice the size of the one that Gulinast had slain came barreling out of the trees toward us. Fires sparked from its paws as, to my astonishment, it began to cast a spell. 
	<br><br>
	My brother was enveloped in flame as the kobold's spell hit home. 
<br><br>
	Anger stirred in me instantly at the sight of the pain on my sibling's face. I could feel the energy welling up inside me waiting to erupt forcibly upon the aggressor.  I focused that energy and channeled it into a shock of cold rage and directed it at the foul beast. It yelped in pain as its skin froze over and turned its burning gaze upon me. As it turned, Gulinast's animation rushed up from behind and began clobbering the blighted cur. Gulinast regained his composure quickly and began to cast a spell of his own. A shimmer of intense light encircled the head of the kobold and stunned the beast long enough for me to cast once more upon the cursed animal. Fire singed it this time and with one final blow from the animation, the kobold fell dead. The scent of burned hair filled my nostrils as my heart raced from the excitement of the fight. I felt changed. I felt as though this brief brush with harm had made me more powerful somehow. I knew that I could control my powers to bring about the death of my enemies and strike down filth such as the abomination that lay singed before us. 
<br><br>
"Feels good, eh?" Said my brother as he bent over and lopped off the strangely shaped paw from our fallen adversary.
<br><br>
"Exhilarating is more like it!" I panted as my heart finally settled in my chest. "I feel so… alive now."
<br><br>
"I told you it was more entertaining than the academy. And more profitable as well." 
<br><br>
	He then held the bag that was around the kobold's waist before me inviting me to take it. I shook out the 4 silver coins from the purse and decided at that moment that I would spend the rest of my days hunting foul beasts such as these. Excitement and pursuit of power would be my profession. 	
<br><br>	
	We stayed in the forest for the rest of the day hunting kobolds. I learned much that day about the dynamics of my craft, and about my brother. I felt that we would have many great adventures in the future and could only speculate where we would wind up.

<br><br>
	I feared retribution for dodging classes when we got home that evening, but none came. Our parents seemed strangely oblivious to the fact that we had even been gone that day. I slumbered well that night and dreamed of the riches and power that my travels would soon bring to me, and the glories of slain enemies yet to be encountered.
<br><br>
"I shall make a name for myself," I said as I drifted into sleep. "My name shall be known."
