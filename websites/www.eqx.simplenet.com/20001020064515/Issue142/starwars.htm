  Who&#146;s ready? </b></font></div>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recently 
  I had an event happen in my life. Perhaps not so recently as it was actually 
  shortly following the Vegas EQ trip in July. My hubby&#146;s family had a crisis 
  and I have had to be in another city except for three or four days out of a 
  month. This sojourn has provided me with a step back from EverQuest, and one 
  I didn&#146;t particularly want. When the crisis came I was becoming even more 
  heavily involved in the community than ever before and enjoying the heck out 
  of the interaction it provided with all of you. In fact one of my last logged 
  times on Oxesiess can easily be ranked as one of the highlights of playing her 
  (the &#147;fans&#148; were just too dang cute and great role-players that I 
  met at the bank {waves}).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 
  I was without a computer I found a tremendous amount of reading time and little 
  else. Modem withdrawal is a terrible thing for a person to go through. Missing 
  that &#145;bshshshshchchchchhc&#146; is an awful feeling. Computers, games, 
  and even the hated writing process are all creative outlets for me and loved 
  hobbies. Not to mention a dang cheap way to communicate with my friends long 
  distance. Finally I decided to track down a public computer I could use. I hit 
  libraries and while I never got to hear the modem sing, I was at least able 
  to surf a bit. Since these computers have some restrictions on what you can 
  do with them, I found myself being in the &#147;look but don&#146;t touch world&#148;. 
  That was a pretty big pouty moment for me as I was dying to leave posts all 
  over the two message boards I track regarding EQ. However, sucking it in I decided 
  to put this &#147;look but no touchy&#148; time to good use. So I went surfing 
  on something that&#146;s up coming and perhaps for a lot of us, a world that&#146;s 
  like no other. Star Wars.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
  information available out there regarding this universe is astounding. I had 
  no idea the fans had been so busy, nor so intense. Sites from completely breaking 
  down the statistics on ships, to physic realities behind the myth (making an 
  actual living breathing light saber), and fan fiction. The Star Wars community 
  has taken everything from the weight of a blaster right down to how many energy 
  charges it would take to fire one and given it life. There&#146;s boards dedicated 
  to literature and the very author&#146;s writing for that universe talking to 
  the readers. It was almost like being in never-never land. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
  am going to date myself here by stating I was a Star Wars generation baby. When 
  the original film came out I was four years old. Born near LA, my father took 
  me to one of the theaters that ran the film the first two weeks it was released 
  (before all the other theaters were scrambling for it.) We stood in line for 
  about three hours to get tickets and this young girl suddenly had her scope 
  of imagination widen farther than anything else I have experienced in comparison. 
  It was the scene where Luke sat there looking at the twin suns. Perhaps such 
  a view seems so simple to include in a sci-fi movie, however I have always felt 
  it was something so simple and yet dramatic that the whole idea of a double 
  sunset would escape most of us.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Perhaps 
  for some people they feel the characters made the show, or the special effects. 
  For me the whole beauty of Star Wars has truly been the scope of such of universe. 
  I am not one of those who fell in love with Mark Hamill or Harrison Ford and 
  wanted to meet either one so I could say I met &#147;Luke&#148; or &#147;Han. 
  It was the background depth of such a different universe and culture that enticed 
  me.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
  fully realize as an adult that if you boil Star Wars down into its essence, 
  the whole story is a space western. But what is it about the world that made 
  an adult woman clutch her husbands arm in a movie theater and lean over to whisper 
  &#147;Love, I never thought I&#146;d see those yellow words on a star field 
  and the trumpets play like that again.&#148; What was it that made all the adults 
  in the theater around me start screaming and cheering when Vader picked up the 
  Emperor? They would have risen to their feet but it was already standing room 
  only.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Star 
  Wars has captured our hearts and minds because of the challenge to our imagination. 
  I am not saying George Lucas reinvented something better than the wheel. Far 
  from it, he took the wheel and gave us such a vastly improved version we became 
  totally captivated by it. And soon this captivating wheel will be open for us 
  to live in together on a mass scale. I do not know about the rest of you but 
  for me personally, that is a scary thought. The fact is that I have played other 
  LucasArt games, just never a role-playing one with all of you on his ground.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It&#146;s 
  scary in the sense that I have seen incredible worlds made and what people do 
  to them. Yes, I speak of EverQuest and other games. EverQuest in its own right 
  is brilliant. Take Halas and the first time you saw snow, the first time you 
  saw the snow change color from the sun going up or down... beautiful. Take Kelethin, 
  take many of the visual aspects of the game and we, I think, can all say &#147;Wondrous&#148;. 
  Now take us out of the game and look what we have done to it. Yes, we. Not anyone 
  else but us in the long run that&#146;s reduced EverQuest to a mere world of 
  numbers and our own definition of &#147;best&#148;. What will we do to the ultimate 
  universe, from a Star Wars baby&#146;s point of view?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Will 
  we reduce the universe we can live in into what is the current topic of the 
  week on unfair? Will we start yelling out in OOC &#147;Is Vader Camped?!&#148; 
  Will we start asking other&#146;s how to get Fett&#146;s super-duper-meany-of-all-time 
  wrist poison dart? Perhaps make spreadsheets on the most efficient bounty hunter 
  for collecting money at 1.5% per hour? What about the consuming debates of perhaps 
  corrupt Moffs because they repoped an area due to a bug? Are we really all ready 
  to see the possibility of those twin suns reduced to the level that might follow 
  on such a mass scope? </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sure 
  we can say &#147;But the game was made this way so I have to {insert reason 
  here}&#148;. Forgive me if I don&#146;t fall in line with the reasoning because 
  of this &#147;have to&#148;. I might feel that is to the most advantage, but 
  that doesn&#146;t mean I have to anything. To be frank, I am almost terrified 
  to play in this new universe, this universe that expanded my scope so much with 
  the simple touches and with its daring. To watch the circumference of a different 
  set of rules merely for overnight &#147;Hahah I am bigger than you {insert derogatory 
  remark that makes someone feel better for putting down someone they don&#146;t 
  know}&#148; thrill or &#147;It&#146;s the way I like to play.&#148; In such 
  a universe as Star Wars the thought makes me shudder.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Star 
  Wars seemed the last untouchable world. True, it&#146;s up to the makers to 
  try to help make the game truly be an RPG for the players. They, however, can 
  only do so much. They can make it a hard game and hurt, which I hope they have 
  the courage to do. They can make us dream of owning a specific blaster, and 
  make it a mark of true skill to have such. They can try to make us want to wet 
  our puter chairs as we are being hunted for our actions, which I hope they do. 
  I recently had a dream about what this new Star Wars able-to-play-in-world would 
  be like. Allow me to indulge myself and your patience a moment relating a dream 
  I had while thinking about all this up coming stuff and being so exhausted after 
  two days sleeping barely a few hours in a chair.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
  dreamt about being a bounty hunter &#147;warrior&#148; type of character. I 
  was skilled in any blaster you could name. My character could do really friggen 
  neato rollies on the ground while firing. In short not only could she kick butt, 
  she had lots of friggen style while doing it. Why bother to blast if you can&#146;t 
  look good doing it? That was her philosophy on life. My partner was an old Internet 
  friend of mine in the forums and EQ named TwoHead. He was a bounty hunter as 
  well, but a slicer mainly. He was a character that is talented with hacking 
  computers. We went after a bounty in cloud city. I think my writing skills lack 
  the talent to portray the scope of the &#147;job&#148; we pulled but let me 
  try</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
  and I were dashing through piles of junk metal, crossing catwalks blasting away 
  while the sun set behind us and the clouds turned pink. Security systems were 
  sounding off while we jumped out of turbo lifts and spotted because our ID&#146;s 
  had been tagged. Driods battling us at every direction and lots of neato rolling 
  shoot moves were being pulled while he sliced into a panel door behind our position. 
  This whole adventure developed all because we dared to pull a job off on target 
  that was popular and living on a floating trap of a city. It was a race and 
  a fight every step of the way to see if we could steal a ship to get out of 
  there and actually collect the money. The running commentary must have had me 
  laughing while I was sleeping with TwoHead and his &#147;Damn it WOMAN! Do you 
  have to do your rolly move while I am WORKING?!&#148; He had almost been hit 
  by gun fire, barely missed since they were aiming for me in front of him. And 
  my reply of, &#147;Dead is dead man! You want me to die without looking my BEST?!&#148;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They, 
  the creators, can make it many things. However, the question is, despite how 
  hard or how soft they make this new world, what are the rest of us going to 
  do to it? And are we ready for what happens when we ourselves make the uncommon, 
  common.</font></p>
