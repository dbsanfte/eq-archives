I've been mulling about the whole issue of roleplaying for, well, it seems like forever.  But mostly since EverQuest came out.  In that time I have been contemplating the differences between player types, trying to see if roleplaying has some sort of definition and attempting to discover what it would take to make a really solid online RPG.
<br><br>
As far as Roleplaying versus Powergaming I think it's mostly an issue of this: Virtual World versus My Own Personal Sandbox theory.  
<br><br>
It is the Powergamer who chooses to live in a Personal Sandbox and the Roleplayer who chooses to live in a Sandbox Ecosystem.  
<br><br>
The Powergamer's world is the one in which everything is their Own Personal Sandbox.  Within the confines of its clearly marked walls they can amass and arrange the sand to their liking.  Many times they have tools with them that will help them accomplish set goals in a set time frame.  The sand about them is theirs; theirs to mold and shape in the best way they see fit.  Nothing really has any meaning until it is put into context with their own ideas.  There are no rules around them aside from their own physical limitations.  And even these they put to the test as they often step outside their sandbox and head to the nearest hardware store for the low down on the latest in SME (Sand Moving Equipment).
<br><br>
Often they will travel to a friend's house and join in as they tromp about their own sandbox.  But they are mostly looking for ways to improve their own techniques.
<br><br>
The Roleplayer's world is that of a Sandbox Ecosystem.  Everything around them is alive.  Everything has or is given some sort of meaning to the roleplayer; a meaning tied as much to them as it is to this 'other' reality that exists about them.  Rules beyond direct physical limitations exist and are to be heeded with a certain sense of awe.  The world does not exist solely for their own utility as there are many other things they would extend the title of 'inhabitant' to, aside from themselves, and they would see its importance in an ever evolving chain of interactions and events.
<br><br>
So what happens when you put these two on a beach and ask them to share the space?
<br><br>
The Powergamers start building sand castles while the roleplayers explore the beach as it is.  Pretty soon, one of the powergamers picks up his cell phone and contacts a friend of his that owns a construction company and the dump trucks and bulldozers start rolling in.  All the while the roleplayer is rushing to and fro trying to salvage remnants of the beach as 'they saw it and hope it would remain.'  
<br><br>
Think about it.
<br><br>
For instance I read a little editorial on EQVault about someone who would probably define themself as a roleplayer training one of those god-like NPCs to a spot where a couple of people who might consider themselves powergamers were one by one killing off the city's guards.
<br><br>
The powergamers were just starting to build their castle when the roleplayer tossed a jellyfish on their shovel.
<br><br>
So who's at fault? 
<br><br>
No one.  According to whoever it was that opened up the beach, each and every one of the people visiting had a right to be there and each and everyone has a right to use the beach as they see fit.  An admirable policy for sure.  However, a misguided one.
<br><br>
How long can it possibly last?
<br><br>
I'm guessing not too long.  Conflicts like the above will continue to occur.  Its not the fault of anyone involved if people get a little miffed.  In fact, its entirely understandable that someone might get a little peeved.
<br><br>
I mean, take a different analogy, how long would you expect a nightclub to last that played an equal mix of Rap and Country music all night?  Probably not very long.  
<br><br>
It's not that people are culturally insensitive.  It's just human nature, period.  Most people prefer one thing to another and often will be unappreciative when placed in a situation where that one thing they dislike is constantly present.  No one is a horrible person for it; no one closed minded; just a matter of preference, plain and simple.  Can't we all get along?  Sure we can.  But does it mean we can't have individual preferences?  Not in the least.
<br><br>
And this is why the nightclub would most likely ultimately fail.  The owners are trying to cater to way too diverse a crowd and are creating a situation where truly, no one is really that pleased. No one can decide what to make of the place and its music selection and between cowboy hats and pants with waistlines down to knees, people just leave.  Sure a few might really love both rap and country music and not mind listening to it in a back to back manner. 
<br><br>
Shouldn't the same go for computer games?  
<br><br>
I think so far when companies develop a Massive Multiplayer game they only have the first word in mind: Massive. They aren't too concerned with the fact that they are plying their wares to a group of players with entirely different goals and ideas about a game.  Blinded by that MASSIVE word, they naively think that player preference should be set aside in pursuit of making the BIGGEST one yet.  Many companies (not all) take a very nebulous stance on issues that may alienate any of the multitude of groups they are trying to all shove into the same room.  They dance around issues that may illustrate divisiveness.
<br><br>
Its like a patron asking the Night Club owner about the music selection; 'I heard on the radio that this was a Country and Western Club' and another saying, 'Hey, I heard it was a Rap Club.' and the Night Club owner responding 'Well, we all love music right?  Just different kinds, so when ya feel like dancing then dance and when ya don't take a little breather!' He says it all with a bright smile and then rushes off to the backroom to sweat it out.
<br><br>
But the fact remains about people, and preferences, and many times just two things don't really fit together too well.  Even if they pass out earplugs to everyone so they can ignore the type of music they don't like (i.e. /roleplaying switch) it's not going to be a passable solution.  
<br><br>
Massive Multiplayers are still in their infancy for sure, but I think their survival depends entirely on a greater degree of specialization which is bound to happen as this game type evolves.  If the industry won't do it, the players will try to create the worlds they want to play in and attract people with similar goals and views. (Take for instance Ultima Online and the emergence of player run servers.)
<br><br>
I think it was P.T. Barnum that said 'You can please some people some of the time, but you can't please all the people all of the time.'  Great wisdom from many years back which is still true today and in many cases, unheeded.
