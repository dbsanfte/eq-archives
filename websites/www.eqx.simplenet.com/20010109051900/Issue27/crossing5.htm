"Angaram, he is protected.  Did you not see his amulet?"
<br><br>
"Of course I dinnae see his bloody amulet, lass!  D'ye think I'd've thrown
m'self upon him otherwise?  Those things need t'be more obvious." grumbles

"Why doth thou despise me so, hairy one?" queries the elf, affecting the
speech of humankind.  "I've done nothing to arouse your ire.  I am simply
travelling along this road, seeking adventure.  I am called Xanorii, a
knight of Shadows and son of Innoruuk.  How might you be called?"
<br><br>
"I'm Angaram, killer o'dark elves.  Her name isnae important.  What's yer
business here?"

"I seek to further the cause of my Father in the city of Qeynos.  There is a
great deal of work to be done as many non-dark elven atrocities still walk
Norrath."  The dark elf flicks an imaginary dust speck from his suede tunic
idly, "I shall join my brethren there and continue their work, corrupting
the worthless humans until they make war upon each other and the other
races, killing two animals with one stone.  And you?"  Xanorii smiles
pleasantly, his melodious voice speaking evenly and matter of factly.
