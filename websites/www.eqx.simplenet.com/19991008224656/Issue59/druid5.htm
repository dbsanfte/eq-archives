Anthiel ran, his lungs laboring, his heart pounding, his muscles aching with fatigue and fear.  He could hear Freygar's heavy footfalls behind him, and the snarls of the Gnolls.  The tunnel curved ever upward, and then, ahead, he could see the door, white daylight seeping under the lintel.
<br><br>
"Freygar, Aklar, just a little further," he gasped.  That was when he heard her despairing scream.
   <br><br>
"<em>Run</em>! <em>They are behind you</em>!"
   <br><br>
"NO!" Anthiel spun around, shoved past Freygar, and saw Aklar dragged backward, gagged and bound.  More Gnolls pushed past her, and she disappeared into the tight packed grey mass.  "NO!" he howled, fighting Freygar as the barbarian grappled with him.
   <br><br>
"No, Anthiel.  We must go on!"
   <br><br>
"No, we can save her! We... they don't kill you! They like to play! Aklar!"
   <br><br>
Freygar shoved him against the door.
   <br><br>
"We have to go!"
   <br><br>
They fell through the door together, started for the entrance in a shambling run.  Anthiel was numb with shock.  When Freygar jerked him to a stop, he didn't at first understand the reason why.  He looked up to see a wide circle of Gnolls around them, grinning, waiting.  They were everywhere, more and more emerging from the trees, from every crevice and fold.  Dozens, each armed and every one with their eyes fixed on the two adventurers.  The ones that had followed them up from the Burrow came out of the door slowly, almost casually.  They knew there was no reason to hurry.
   <br><br>
"Ambush.  Playing with us," said Anthiel bitterly.
   <br><br>
"When I say run, make for the entrance," said Freygar, his voice low and urgent.
   <br><br>
"Frey..."
   <br><br>
"Just do it!"  Their eyes met and Anthiel nodded reluctantly.
   <br><br>
"One must get through and it has to be you, old friend.  I will hold them."  Freygar's face was set.
   <br><br>
"May your God welcome you home, Freygar," Anthiel whispered.  Tears stung his eyes.  The Gnolls drew the circle tighter.
   <br><br>
"May yours shelter you," Freygar gripped his shoulder.  "Now, run!" and he threw himself at one of the smaller Gnolls, and cut him down with one mighty blow, opening a small gap in the circle.  Anthiel sprang through it, sliding around a blow from the side.  The ring collapsed over Freygar and he barely kept his feet under the press.  Only two Gnolls broke off and came after Anthiel.  He ran, fleet and graceful as was his entire race, and they should never have caught him.
   <br><br>
On top of the jutting finger of rock, a Gnoll watcher drew fletching to ear and released in one motion.  The blunt stone point took the Elf in the temple, and felled him just in front of the entrance.   He collapsed, and the Gnolls in pursuit had him bound and slung over a grey shoulder in a flash.  They went sideways, into a low cave opening, and the Elf was gone.
   <br><br>
Freygar saw them go, and a wave of black despair swept over him.  It had all been in vain, and now there was no one to warn of the danger, no one to make Aklar and Anthiel's sacrifices mean anything.
   <br><br>
"NO!" he roared.  He bled in a dozen places, his left arm was nearly useless, the Gnoll on the lookout was raising his bow again, and the sun glinted off a steel broadhead point.  And Freygar rose up from under the pile of Gnolls.  They went flying as the berserk rage took him and red flooded his vision.
   <br><br>
He spun, two handed sword shearing through air and Gnoll bodies with equal ease.  The Gnoll watcher let fly and he ducked the arrow fluidly, watched it take a guardsman in the neck.  He snatched a knife out of his belt, flicked it through the air, and turned to cut down another guardsman even as the watcher tumbled from his perch.  They had to die, all of them, pay for Anthiel, pay for Aklar.  Blood ran down his blade onto his hands, making his grip slippery.
   <br><br>
<em>One of us must live to get the message through</em>.
   <br><br>
He turned and broke for the entrance, tossing off Gnolls left and right as they came at him.  He heard the Gnoll commander's gravelly tones.  He snarled his frustration, and kept going.  Blood... he wanted blood payment for his loss, but Aklar's words resounded still.  
   <br><br>
Blue light blossomed around him, and for one confused second he thought that Anthiel or Aklar had gotten free.  Instead of the soothing cool of a healing spell, however, the light sank into his flesh like lead, making him heavy and slow, making his joints ache.  He fought grimly on, won through to the entrance, and then the air itself ignited around him.  He bellowed in pain as the fire clung to him, fell to one knee under the blows of the Gnolls that still followed him.  He struggled up, not even fighting anymore, and staggered through the jagged gap.  The Gnoll fell back superstitiously, despite the commander's shouts and the shrill exhortations of the High Shaman.
  <br><br>
 Freygar dragged himself along the wall of the entrance tunnel, eyes fixed on the dim promise of daylight ahead.  He emerged between the massive fangs of the stone Gnoll head into a quiet twilight.  Not ten paces away, three Rangers turned in surprise as he crumpled to the ground.  They rushed to him.  Hands lifted his head, raised him as gently as possible, and carried him away from BlackBurrow.
   <br><br>
"Aklar," he whispered painfully, trying to tell them, to make them understand.
   <br><br>
"Lie still, my friend," said a Half-Elven Ranger, her brow creased with worry.
   <br><br>
"The Gnolls... tell Bayle," he forced the words out through the red haze of agony.  "Tell him... the Ritual of..." Black bled into the red, and Freygar knew no more.
<br><br>

   <p style="text-align: justify">
Aklar opened her eyes to pitch-blackness.  Her head ached, her entire body hurt, and she was cold.  She lay on damp stone, cheek pressed to the ground.  She stirred, and groaned as every pain, large and small, suddenly flared to twice the intensity.   She pushed herself up into a sitting position and clutched at her head.  Memory crashed home, and she made a small sound of despair.  Maybe the others had gotten away.  It was her only hope.
   <br><br>
A few paces away, someone stirred.  Aklar froze, breath catching in her throat.  The noise repeated itself, a rustling as of someone turning over in sleep.  Then the unknown person moaned.  Aklar drew in breath again. She knew that voice.
   <br><br>
"Anthiel?" she asked, tears rising before she could quell them.  So they had caught him as well.  She feared to ask about Freygar.
   <br><br>
"Aklar?" he said, his voice muzzy and confused.  She crawled over to him and fumbled for his hand.  He gripped her fingers weakly.  "I'm sorry."
   <br><br>
"For what?" She wiped her cheeks angrily.
   <br><br>
"For failing you.  We failed you."  He gave a shuddering sigh.  "I think Freygar is dead."
   <br><br>
Aklar closed her eyes, the ache in her heart overwhelming that of her body.
   <br><br>
"Are you sure?"  There could not be enough tears and so she would not cry.  She would not.
   <br><br>
"I didn't see him die... but there were so many, I don't think he could have made it through alive.  He was keeping them busy so I could get away.  And I couldn't even make his sacrifice worthwhile," Anthiel said bitterly.  He sat up with a jerk and then sucked in a breath.
   <br><br>
"What is it?" Aklar ran quick professional hands over him, searching for the wound.
   <br><br>
"It's nothing, please," he pushed ineffectually at her hands, trying to stop her.  She found the huge knot on his temple and gasped.  Gently fingers explored it.
   <br><br>
"This is not good.  It was very nearly enough to crack your skull," she said, shaking her head.  "Hold still."  
<br><br>
She cleared her mind, slowed her breathing, and called to Tunare silently.  She made the familiar gestures of healing.  No blue light outlined her fingers, no wash of cool comfort came.  Instead, fat blue sparks crawled over her hands as though imprisoned, and then died.
   <br><br>
"Cursed," said the Elf bleakly.  "Likely sanctified to Innoruuk or whatever deity the Gnoll shamans get their power from.  Our gods have no power here.  If one of us were a wizard..." he trailed off, leaning back against the stone wall.  Aklar felt for his hand again.  "I don't understand why they didn't kill us.  We should be dead or wishing we were right now."
   <br><br>
"The Dark Elf said he wanted to question me." Aklar faltered.  "I guess he wanted to talk to you too."
   <br><br>
She felt Anthiel shudder slightly
   <br><br>
"We may yet wish we were in the care of the Gnolls.  The Children of Innoruuk are most talented in the art of the Question."  Aklar began to tremble uncontrollably.  "I'm sorry," said Anthiel immediately.  "That was a stupid thing to say.  Maybe..." he stopped, unable to think of any way to comfort her.
   <br><br>
"Just... hold me," Aklar said.  He was silent a moment and then hesitantly drew her into his arms.
   <br><br>
"Aklar," he whispered, and then paused.
   <br><br>
"What?" she asked.
   <br><br>
"Nothing," he said, and brushed her hair away from her face.  Her breathing slowed, and she drifted into an uneasy slumber.
   <br><br>
The few hours that he spent in the dark, holding her in his arms, was a form of exquisite torture for Anthiel.  He could smell her hair, feel the skin of her cheek pressed against his arm.  She sighed in her sleep, and once, a small sound like a sob escaped her lips.  He smoothed her hair back from her brow and she relaxed, snuggling against him.  He shivered, not from the cold but from longing.  He wanted to wake her, press his lips to hers.  In the middle of despair, Anthiel discovered love, and it was a bittersweet distraction from the bleakness of the stone prison they huddled in.  At last he dozed, head bowed to his chest, one hand still tenderly lay on her head.
<br><br>
"How charming."  Anthiel's eyes snapped open, and then tried to close themselves again as light, blindingly bright after their time in the dark, invaded the cell.  Aklar stirred and sat up, shielding her eyes.  The Dark Elf stood in the doorway, outlined in light, face hidden by the contrast of shadow.  "How very heartwarming.  But I fear I must borrow her for a while, my High cousin."  He snapped his fingers and two burly Gnolls came in and pulled Aklar away from Anthiel.  She struggled silently, teeth bared.  
<br><br>
"No!" Anthiel sprang to his feet and beat at the Gnolls with his fists.  One half turned and struck him across the face, sending him staggering.  The Dark Elf made a small gesture, and paralysis gripped Anthiel.  He strove to move, to speak, but it was as much as he could do to breathe.  Aklar was dragged out the door.  One final, terrified look back at him and she was gone.  The hateful Elf walked up to him.  Though shorter, he somehow managed to loom, to stare Anthiel in the eye.
<br><br>
"Don't worry."  The sensual lips skinned back from his teeth, turning his beauty into something twisted and hideous.  "We, too, will have our time together.  I look forward to it."  He reached out and not quite touched Anthiel's face.  Antheil strained back, panting in rage and disgust.  The Elf laughed low in his throat, and turned away.  
   <br><br>
The invisible bonds released Anthiel as the door slammed shut.  He collapsed to his knees, his muscles twitching and jerking from the touch of the dark magic.
   <br><br>
"Innoruk's get!" he spat after him.  Empty words.  Aklar, in that... thing's hands.  He beat his hands bloody against the door, screamed his voice hoarse, and got nothing but the chuffing laughter of the Gnoll guardsmen.  At last, exhausted and drained, he slid down the wall to the floor.
<br><br>
To Aklar, the trip into the bowels of the Burrow was a nightmare of confusion and terror.  They went deeper and deeper, ever downward through long twisting tunnels.  Everywhere were Gnolls, who laughed and snapped at her with sharp white teeth as she was hustled past.  Each time she would flinch, and her guards would share a grin with each other and force her on, faster than before.  By the time they reached their destination, she was almost running.  She was jerked to a halt before a wide, low door guarded by two huge Gnolls, both armed with pikes.
   <br><br>
"The Lord D'anok wishes to question this woman."  
   <br><br>
They regarded her silently for a long moment, and then one smiled.  He nodded at the door and the other opened it.  Aklar was thrust violently into the room beyond.  She went sprawling as the door slammed shut behind her.
   <br><br>
Slowly she got to her feet.  The room was bare, devoid of any furnishings.  The only thing in it was a globe of white light that hung above the center, casting a pale, unforgiving glow.  The only exit was the door she had come in.  The walls were rough and unfinished, the floor uneven stone.  The air was cold and damp, and Aklar shivered in her torn leathers.  She straightened, stiffening her spine.  She was a Druid.  Tunare was with her, and would shelter her in her hands.  She had only to hold to faith, and faith would see her through.  She wished she could stop shivering.
   <br><br>
Suddenly the silver spheres of a Gate quivered in the air by the door, and the Dark Elf - Lord D'anok- appeared.  Aklar's resolve vanished like a puff of smoke.  Her back hit the wall before she was aware that she had moved.  He smiled and his hands moved languidly, trailing dark blue sparks.
   <br><br>
Invisible manacles clamped about her wrists and dragged her forward and up until she hung in the air at the center of the room.  He gestured again, a flick of slim elegant fingers, and her leathers burst apart, falling in a rain of instant decay.  Clad only in her white linen singlet, she shuddered.  She could feel the darkness of his magic.  It dimmed her sight, roiled her stomach, and made her skin crawl as if armies of insects marched up and down her body.  She could feel Tunare withdraw, hurt by the presence of the Elf's evil God.
<br><br>   
He stepped toward her, smile slowly widening, lips parting as if to taste the tang of her fear.
<br><br>   
"Shall we begin?"
