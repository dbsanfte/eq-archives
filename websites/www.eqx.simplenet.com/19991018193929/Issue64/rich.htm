	Richelieu sat and thought. The small home he shared with his mother seemed especially squalid now. His mother lay on the bed, fevered and sweating. She had been stricken by the mysterious disease sweeping through Qeynos, which even clerics could not cure. Or rather, could not cure cheaply, since the components require were extremely expensive, and a luxury only for the wealthy. A luxury that he and his mother could not afford.
<br><br>
	She mumbled incoherently, and Richelieu fetched her some water as he knew she meant. As he headed for the local well, he thought for awhile about his father. Richelieu never knew his father, since he had abandoned his mother before his birth. He was an Erudite, and a mage as most people of that land are. They met in a local inn, where his father was staying and his mother worked as a maid. The two got to know each other as he stayed, and eventually fell in love. They became each other's sole source of love, since his mother was an orphan and his father never told her of his family or former homeland.
<br><br>
	The two finally eloped, since neither had the finances or religious inclination for a wedding. His mother did believe in the gods, chiefly Tunare, but was far from devout. His father merely acknowledged their existence, and otherwise paid them no heed. The two finally saved enough money for a modest apartment; his mother worked extra hours at the Inn, and his father performed some sort of service for a few of the local mages in Qeynos. There they lived, and happily so for a few years.
<br><br>
	One night, as they walked home from the home of some friends, they were ambushed in an alleyway. From the darkness three thugs emerged: a human, a half-elf, and a barbarian. The half-elf spoke: "You will give us your money and your woman, or you will give us your lives. Decide quickly."
<br><br>
	Richelieu's father replied, "Leave. Now." The barbarian grunted, and each drew a weapon. His father whispered gently, and energy swirled out from his hands to in front of the thugs. The energy expanded and flared. It became an inferno, an inferno in human shape. "Kill," his father whispered in a voice filled with malice. The elemental drew close to the half-elf and began to sear through his flesh. The barbarian and human struck it with their weapons, but all this accomplished was to heat the metal, scarring their hands. "Help! HELP! MERCY!" the half-elf cried. His father made no motion, and the half-elf was reduced to a pile of charred bones. The human looked on in terror, and fled. His father turned his attention towards the barbarian, and softly said, "Ask me for your life." The barbarian looked infuriated at such a humiliating command, but decided to comply. He did not wish to be burned to death, which would cause his soul to be sent to Hades forever. He knelt, bowed his head, and spat, "...Please spare shaman. I sorry to anger you."
<br><br>
	At this, his father snorted in amusement, and waved him off. The barbarian grudgingly picked up his still warm axe, looked nervously at the elemental, once more with hatred at the summoner, and walked away.
<br><br>
	Richelieu's mother, who had witnessed all this, looked with horror at him. She looked at the living holocaust, then down at the blackened bones. She trembled to see him act so coldly, and was terrified of him now. He whispered once more, and the elemental dissipated. "Let's go home," he spoke. She complied, and followed him. 
<br><br>
	That night, upon arrival, his father immediately took out one of the tomes she rarely saw him open before, and began poring over its contents. She went to the bedroom, and lay down, but could not sleep for hours. Her dreams that night and for months afterwards were of blazing fires and ebon skeletons.
<br><br>
	After this, the two began to argue and fight. Day after day, after his father's arrival from his duties, he would return and the conflicts would begin. He would yell and scream, but never use force. Finally, three months after the incident, they learned she was pregnant with Richelieu. A few days later, after the most intense fight, his father packed his belongings and left.
<br><br>
	By the time Richelieu was born, his mother had to move out of their old home and into the home in which she and Richelieu would live for the next twelve years. His schoolmasters were amazed at the boy's intellect; he talked coherently when he was six months old, began to read when he was a year old, and mastered Common, Elven, and Erudite when he was three. However, they were alarmed at his aloof demeanor, and disturbed by his tendency to know things he should not. How could he know the layout of Neriak, or the geography of Faydwer without ever having seen or read of either? Still, they taught him what they could, and usually it was not enough.
<br><br>
	However, his classmates were another story. Most of them hated him; this tall, lean genius among them. It did not help that he was naturally unfriendly, and their masters treated him specially. He was frequently taunted and humiliated, yet never retaliated. This angered them more, and he was the accepted outcast among the local schoolchildren.
<br><br>
	So his life had been until today. By the time Richelieu had reflected on all this, he had gone to the well and back. He poured some of the water into a small jar, and gave it to his mother. Her voice became understandable, and she said, "Thank you Richelieu. I want to tell you something. Your mother is very sick, and may well not be here much longer. You're getting to be a big boy now, twelve summers old now. I want you to be careful. Stay out of trouble, and if you ever need help go see old Gnorth at the Inn. He helped me when I was younger, and though he will be further on in years now, he can still help you. Now, you go to bed. You need some rest as much as I do."
<br><br>
	Richelieu said, "Yes ma'am. Good night mom."
<br><br>
"I love you dear," she said.
<br><br>
"You too, mom," he responded, in the way that young boys do. He put out all the candles but one, and headed to his room. He scampered into his small bed, and went to sleep.
<br><br>
	He awoke in the night, in a cold sweat. The sound of newly falling raindrops startled him, and he felt disturbed. He knew not how, but somehow he knew to go to his mother. He rushed into her room, and hurried to her side. "Mom? You okay?" he whispered. She did not stir. The boy walked by the side of her bed and checked her fever. He laid his hand on her forehead, and froze. It was cold. "Mom?" he said fearfully. He reached for the candle and put it by her lips. The flame burned straight and steady.
<br><br>
	"Mom? Mom!?" he cried. "What's wrong? MOM!" he screamed, now knowing what had happened. "Mom..." he whimpered, and began to cry. Richelieu heard the dull roar, and then crack of thunder. There he laid, next to his mother's body, for what seemed like an eternity and wept. 
<br><br>
	He was taken out of his daze by the first rays of the dawn sun coming through the doorframe. He remembered his mother's words the night before, to go see old Gnorth at the Inn.  He hastily put on his sandals, took one last look at his mother, still crying, and rushed out the door. 
<br><br>
	Richelieu sprinted through the streets and alleys of Qeynos, catching the eyes of those up so early. As he trekked through the streets, his foot caught on a cobblestone, and he fell. He was splashed with the dirty water in the puddle from the prior night's storm. Feeling wretched and cold, he felt this was the gods' final insult; they had taken his heritage, his mother, and even the dignity of grief. However, apparently the gods were not yet finished, for at this point three small figures walked up behind him.
<br><br>
	"Looks like we got a mudskipper 'ere, 'uh Bobby?" snickered one of them. "Heh heh, yeah, looks like Mr. Genius Boy here fell. Maybe we should teach him how to swim!" replied another, a bit pudgier than the rest. "I know," spoke the last, "let's introduce him to the taste of mud!" said the tallest of the group.
<br><br>
	Richelieu got up, his already poor secondhand tunic covered in grime, and looked at his spectators. They were three of the boys from his school; Rygar, son of a guard; Robert, the stout one, was the nephew of the harbormaster; and Darun, the de facto leader of the bunch. They had always hassled him, and Richelieu avoided them whenever possible.
<br><br>
	"What's wrong? Did our prince ruin his fine tunic?" mocked Rygar. "Ere, let me finish dyeing it for you!" he shouted. Rygar shoved Richelieu back into the puddle. "Heh heh heh," Robert squealed with glee. "Bet his momma would spank him for dirtying his clothing so!" he continued.
<br><br>
	"Yeah, why aren't you with your mommy Richelieu? Or is she sooo sick that even you can't stand her, mama's boy?" said Darun.
<br><br>
	Up to this point, Richelieu did as he always did: he stood there and took it until they grew bored and left. However, this time it was different. For the first time in his young life, Richelieu felt angry; he felt ENRAGED. He could feel his body tensing, and his fingers curled into fists at his sides.
<br><br>
	"What are you gonna do, hit me?" cackled Darun. "My dad paid to get me some fighting lessons from the Warrior's Guild. I can knock you flat in three seconds!"
<br><br>
	Richelieu did not respond. He felt filled with emotion, filled with power. Unconsciously he began whispering under his breath and instinctively began waving his hands in a pattern.
<br><br>
	"What are you doing you fruit?!" demanded Rygar. "E's gone nuts! Let's give 'im a whack or two to straighten 'im out!" "Huh huh, uh... uhm... guys..." Robert said in a hushed tone.
<br><br>
	Richelieu's whisper became a chant, then a shout. Swirls and wisps of reddish light formed about his hands. A low pitched hum could be heard, and then a crackle. Richelieu could feel tremendous anger and power coursing through his being, and was frightened and furious at the same time. The light flowed out from his hands to behind the trio, and flashed. A pattern of light could be seen on the ground, and this pattern grew and inflated into the form of an animal. The animal solidified into a wolf, and lunged at Darun.
<br><br>
	"HELP!" Darun pleaded. The wolf sunk its fangs into his shoulder, and pinned his arms down with its paws. "Get it off me!" he shrieked. The other two boys looked at the wolf, mortified, then started beating it with their fists. The canine shrugged these blows off, tore deeper into Robert's flesh, and shook its head vigorously.
<br><br>
	During this Richelieu stood there, focused on the wolf and its actions. He could feel its muscles tense and flex with every motion; he could feel its mind, and control it as well. He felt intoxicated with power, and pleasure at the thought of torturing his tormentors. However, in a flash of insight he realized what he had done, and he felt sick to his stomach. In that instant the wolf looked up at Richelieu, then disappeared in a puff of crimson mist. 
<br><br>
	Darun laid there, now unconscious, with his tunic soaked vermilion. The other two slowly looked up at Richelieu in fear. Then they bolted, towards the guard post.
<br><br>
	At this point a few residents heard the fuss and looked outside to investigate. All they could see was Darun laying on the ground, bleeding profusely, and Richelieu standing near him, looking down at him. Richelieu looked up, startled, and realized what would happen to him if the guards caught him: punishment for certain, and if Darun died, death as well. The guards were not concerned with age for such serious crimes. Even worse if certain mystical or religious groups should hear of this... at the thought of it, Richelieu recoiled in shock. He realized he must run, escape whoever might pursue him. He thought of Gnorth at the Inn, and fled.
<br><br>
	He ran down every back alleyway he could, through every tight squeeze that a full-grown guard could not fit through to chase a young boy. After nearly collapsing from exhaustion, he reached the Traveler's Delight Inn. He walked in through the door, seeming out of place next to the burly barbarian warriors, conniving halfling thieves, and drunken dwarven merchants. He made his way to the back of the room, towards the bar, dodging the boisterously waving arms of a barbarian shaman with his friends.
<br><br>
	"Excuse me," Richelieu sniffed, "but can I see Gnorth? It's very important."
<br><br>
"Yeah," the grizzled old barkeep growled, "he's upstairs in his room."
<br><br>
"Thank you," Richelieu politely said, trying to hide the fear and grief in his voice.
<br><br>
	Richelieu crept up the stairs, getting out of the way of a human clad in chain mail as he went. He arrived at Gnorth's door, and peeked in. "Mr. Gnorth? It's Richelieu, I need your help." he squeaked.
<br><br>
"Come over here, child, and tell me yer troubles," Gnorth replied. Gnorth was a rather large old man, with a bushy gray mustache and earthy demeanor. He pushed himself out from his desk, and bade Richelieu to come sit on his lap.  "How's your mom little man?" he inquired.
<br><br>
At this Richelieu burst into tears. "That's what I'm here about," he sobbed, "and something else..." He blurted out his story, about his mother's death, the other boy's cruelty and what happened to them. When Gnorth heard about the wolf and its attack, he turned pale.
<br><br>
	"Child," he said, " I always knew something bad would happen to you. Your father was a quiet man, but the few times I saw him I felt something odd about him. I suppose he's the one you got that from.  Your momma was a kindly lass, but didn't have a speck of the unusual in her. You're right, the guards will come looking for ya, but don't worry. This here old man'll hide you, and help ya get out. Look, you wait in here 'til nightfall with me. If ya hear anyone coming, hide in the closet. The harbormaster owes me a favor, and I figure I can get him to let ya on his boat."	
<br><br>
	"His boat?" Richelieu asked.
<br><br>
"Yeah, ta Erudin. That's where your dad was from, I figure, and that's where ya oughta go. If'ns anyone can tell ya what that wolf was about, it's them mage folk that live there. Plus ya might be able to learn 'bout yer daddy, find out a bit o' yer heritage. Now you wait in here. I'm gonna go to the docks and have a talk with ol' Gunthar. I'll be back before nightfall, you just sit tight, hear?"
<br><br>
	"Yes sir," Richelieu responded. "Good," Gnorth said. "There's half loaf of bread on my desk.  You can eat it if ya get hungry. I'm going now, you be a good boy and stay quiet."
<br><br>
	Richelieu slid off of Gnorth's wide lap, and looked up at him. Gnorth reached in his closet, put on his cloak, smiled at Richelieu and walked out the door. Richelieu propped himself up on Gnorth's bed. For the first time that day, he realized how hungry he was and devoured the bread.
	<br><br>
The small windows in the room became portals for deep orange light before Gnorth returned. Richelieu had spent his time crying until he fell asleep, and Gnorth returned to see him stretched out on his bed. "Guess I'll let him sleep a bit more, little fella must be pooped after a day like this," Gnorth thought to himself. He quietly walked across to his desk and halfheartedly resumed his paperwork, wiping breadcrumbs off his documents.
<br><br>
	Finally nightfall came, and Gnorth woke Richelieu up. "Okay boy, it's time." Richelieu stirred, and rubbed his eyes before looking at him. "Here you go, this here note is what you give to Gunthar; he'll be on the docks waiting for you," he said as he handed Richelieu a scrap of parchment. "And here's a bit of coin, use it to pay for food and drink, it should last you awhile." Gnorth handed him 3 gold pieces. Richelieu felt excited as he looked at the shiny yellow coins; he had never held so much money in his life. When he remembered why he was going on the boat, the sobbed anew. "Look boy, you gotta be quiet when you sneak out. Be brave, I'll try and get in touch with you every so often." Gnorth rubbed his cheeks and wiped away the tears. He moved across the room and opened the window. "There's a terrace out there. You can jump down where you see the hay under it."
<br><br>
	Richelieu put the note and coins in his pocket, and scurried to the windowsill. "Good luck boy, may Erollisi guide you." Richelieu felt comforted at his meaning, but contempt at the mention of the goddess. He passed through the window, across the terrace, and jumped onto the hay. He dusted himself off and made his way to the shipyards in the darkness.
<br><br>
	There he met Gunthar. Gunthar was very large for a half-elf, and very burly as well. The only aspect that gave his race away was his ears, otherwise he was as human as human could be. "So you're the brat that Gnorth sent me. Well, don't know why he's sending you, but it ain't my business now. You're lucky that this voyage is a cargo travel, no way in Tethys I'd wait this long if we had passengers. You can stay in the cargo hold, but I warn you: if I catch you pilfering any of my goods, over the side you go. Hear?"
<br><br>
	Richelieu swallowed and nodded. Gunthar gestured for him to walk across the plank to the ship, and Richelieu acquiesced. Gunthar untied the ropes tying the ship to the dock, and walked across. He gave his final commands to his small crew, and drew the plank. The sails unfurled, the anchor was raised. The ship silently drew away from the coastline, and sailed out into the night.
<br><br>
	The voyage lasted for a day. Richelieu stayed in the cargo hold, watched by a bored, young sailor. From his attitude, Richelieu could tell that the sailor was probably newly hired, and annoyed at such an assignment. After the novelty of the ship wore off, Richelieu sat and mourned. The sailor became concerned, and tried to ask what was wrong, but Richelieu did would not respond. The young man eventually stopped trying, and returned to his spot, a bit uneasy.
<br><br>
	They arrived in Erudin finally, one day later in the morning. Richelieu went updeck when he heard that land was spotted, and looked out across the sea. He gazed across the deep sapphire ocean towards the land, a gentle green slope. His eyes wandered until he caught a glimpse of ivory, and he knew he looked upon Erudin at last. The marble buildings of the city inspired him with their beauty, and filled him with wonder. They also made him think of his father.  He felt nervous and anxious about arriving in the mysterious homeland of the man he never knew.
<br><br>
	The ship pulled up to the docks of Erudin, and came to a halt. The anchor was dropped and the plank put across. Gunthar came up to Richelieu. "We're here. Scram now kid, you'll only get in the way." Richelieu was angered at such insolence, but merely obeyed the gruff old sailor and walked across.
<br><br>
	He walked down the pier, and saw a tall, thin man looking across the waters. The man seemed caught in thought, but looked down at the interesting character in front of him. "What is a child such as yourself doing here, on a cargo ship of all places?" the stranger asked.
<br><br>
"I'm here to go to the mage school, sir," Richelieu answered. 
<br><br>
"My my my, this is intriguing. Well, it's over there, the large white spire. I hope that you can get a change of clothes, you look positively vile."
<br><br>
	At this Richelieu looked down at his clothing, which had not been changed or washed at all yet. He thanked the tall man and made his way to the spire. He came to the entrance and looked up. It was a marvel. He entered, but was confused by his surroundings. There were strange glowing gems in the tower. The first time he stepped onto one, he was absolutely bewildered. He then remembered tales of the teleportation gems made by the High Men, and grew accustomed to them. He made his way up the tower, until he came across a scholarly looking old man.
<br><br>
	Excuse me sir, but where do I join the mage school?" Richelieu asked.
<br><br>
"Where does one join the Academy of Arcane Studies you ask? Right here as a matter of fact. And why might you want to do such a thing?" the old scholar demanded.  Richelieu stood there and spilled out his tale. The wizened old man listened intently to his story, and became concerned when Richelieu told of the wolf's attack. "So you say you summoned, without any knowledge of the art, out of sheer force of will? I know of only one instance of such an occurrence.... Yes, you do look like him..." the old man trailed off.
<br><br>
"Like who?" Richelieu asked, in a surprisingly loud tone of voice.
<br><br>
"You will be told in time, young one. For now know this: you are henceforth accepted into the Academy of Arcane Studies, to be trained in the arts of Summoning and Conjuring. We will help you refine your talent, and your questions will be answered in time. Now, come this way, you must be registered before your education can begin."
<br><br>
	Richelieu looked up at the man, fairly certain the man he spoke of was his father. He was intensely curious as to what the old man knew, but held his tongue. He was both nervous and excited at the thought of learning to cultivate and control his 'talent'. He now knew there was no looking back at his past, and his life would be far different from anything he had ever imagined.
