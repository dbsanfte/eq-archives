<em>But is was on the surface of Norrath that Tunare's creation of the Elves, creatures whose limitless grace and beauty was only exceeded by their mastery of magic, drew the unwanted attention of Innoruuk, Prince of Hate. In a decrepit tower overlooking the dark decaying alleys of the Plane over which he rules, Innoruuk waited, stoking the fire of his Hate until it was a raging inferno. He cursed his fellow gods for not including him in their pact and vowed to make them regret this disrespect. From the halls of the Elves' fair city, Takish-Hiz, the Prince of Hate snatched away the Elven King and Queen. In his realm of pain and anger he slowly tore them apart, physically and mentally, over the course of three thousand years. He then gathered the quivering pieces of these beings of light and rebuilt them in his own dark sadistic image, a twisted mockery of Tunare's noble children. In depositing The Teir'Dal, as Innoruuk's Dark Elven creations would come to be called, back into the Underfoot of Norrath, the seeds for The Prince of Hate's final revenge were sown.</em>

Galarin awoke with a start as a chill breeze danced across his damp flesh.  He looked around the room feverishly, eyes darting as if to take in every shadow in a glance.  Shrouded in a deep shadow was the intricate four posted bed of wildwood where he lay.  At the moment the darkness seemed stifling.  Sitting upright, half covered by damp silken sheets; the bed became worse than the darkness.  Suddenly it felt like a deep, dark inky pool.  It clung to him like a thin film.  His eyes fluttered as the depths of the liquid silk tried to submerge him once again into a restless sleep.  Shaking his head in defiance he bounded out of his bed, roughly striking the woman sleeping next to him in his haste.  The exceptionally beautiful elven female winced and raised her head.  Eyes heavy with sleep she spoke slowly, "I swear Galarin, you'll be sleeping on the floor again if you kick me out of this bed......."
<br><br>
"I will not return to it!" he screamed defiantly as he raced across the room and tore open the wooden shutters.  The woman sat straight up, back against the headboard of the bed, and pulled the silken sheets tightly around her.  She stared wide eyed at Galarin, disregarding the sudden flood of early morning light.  He stood directly in the large, waist-high window, pressed closely to the windowsill.  Wafting through the window came a cool breeze which rustled the curtains, yet Galarin's sweat-laden night shirt clung tightly to his shoulders, motionless.
<br><br>
A muffled shout was heard from the other side of the stout bedroom door.  Rebounding heavily off of the thick wooden wall of the room, the door flew open.  Two knights clad in resplendent armor of silver scales burst in through the doorway, long swords in hand.  "My liege..." one began in excited tones. 
<br><br>
Galarin remained at the window, staring out across the forest below.  Quietly and deliberately he spoke, "Tis nothing, return to your watch."   The first of the two knights turned a quizzical look to Palantha as he continued to scan the room.  His eyes widened as he took note of her form beneath the silken sheets.  They offered little protection from the chill morning breeze.  Hastily, he averted his gaze to the ground and whirled to face the other knight.  Turning back to Galarin in an awkward spin, he bowed deeply.  Too deeply, nearly falling forward in his haste. "Forgive me my liege....my....my lady"  With a rigid turn back to the door, he stepped out of the room, pushing the other knight with him.   Galarin stood motionless at the window as the door closed behind them.
<br><br>
Palantha twisted her legs off the edge of the bed slowly, and cautiously planted her bare feet on the cold floor.  She stood and crossed the room even more slowly, still clutching the sheet to her body and dragging the whispering wave of silk behind her.  Galarin, still stood staring fixedly out the window bathed in the morning sunlight.   Carefully, she placed a hand on his shoulder.  Her brow furrowed in concern as she felt the cool, heavy sweat that saturated his night shirt.  She looked up at his golden head of hair, matted and slick.   "Galarin...."  she paused and continued in a soft whisper, "was it.....was it him?"
<br><br>
Galarin winced at the words and as he shivered under Palantha's touch she let out a muffled cry.  Letting the sheet drop, she reached out and clung tightly to him.  
<br><br>

<p style="text-align: justify">
The sun shone on the dense forest with the muted radiance of early fall.  Shrouded in shadow by burgeoning trees ages old, the forest floor was cool and lit only by those rays of light that managed to weave their way through the thick reddish-brown canopy of leaves above.  In places, light pierced through gaps in the heavy canopy, illuminating the forest floor in irregular patterns whose boundaries shifted as the gentle autumn breeze rustled the trees above.  
<br><br>
A lone female elf walked purposefully among the patchwork illumination.  Silently she moved, despite the light cover of brittle leaves on the ground.  As she climbed to the edge of a low ravine, she hesitated and peered into the clearing that lay beyond.  Just below, a man with a rough brown cloak knelt delicately on one knee at the edge of a pristine pool.  A pool of water so clear that even from this distance she could see the smooth, glittering stones that littered the bottom.  Before this man, the water seemed to rise in a bent shimmering column, leaning slightly in his direction.  She continued to watch as the column seemed to branch off and reach out towards him, coming to rest on his bent knee.  Intrigued by the scene, she crept closer to the edge of the rise.   The column took on shape and form and she edged closer.  The strange, solid projection resting on his knee, sat lightly and moved with a curiously familiar movement.  A light touch, perhaps even a gentle caress.  It seemed, almost human.  She followed the projection up along its clear, nearly transparent contours.  She struggled with the shape in her mind.  So familiar yet foreign in such a state.   The shape and subtle curve sat precariously on the edge of her thought.  She crept closer.  The light crunch of  newly fallen leaves below her feet turned to the snap of a dry twig.   The water shivered, sending out a cascade of ripples as it changed position; almost seeming to turn toward her .  Appearing to follow the water's wild movements, the man turned and stared up in her direction through narrow eyes.  She was suddenly aware of two faces staring up at her.  One face of the man, the other...of the water!  Instinctively she started to duck but stopped in mid stoop.  Remembering who she was and that this in fact was the man she had come to see, she saw no need to hide herself.  There was a sudden disturbance in the pond which sent water lapping at the banks in a dulating frenzy.  She watched as the familiar shape of the column of water became clear and she stared as the transparent curves of a female figure rapidly flattened into the pool's smooth surface.
<br><br>
The man stood, watching her intently through a tousled mane of dark black hair streaked with gray.  As he reached out to pick a heavy oaken staff off the ground  he called out, "Who's there?"
<br><br>
"Forgive me Rale, it is Palantha." she said as she slowly descended into the small ravine that held the crystal pool.
<br><br>
She watched as Rale lowered his staff and stood from his crouched position.  Throwing a side long glance at the pool beside him, he bowed deeply.  "It is an honor, my Queen. The forest is blessed with your presence and gives sanctuary to your people."  
  <br><br>
"I'm sorry to intrude, I know how you value your solitude my friend.  However, I am in need of your counsel."
<br><br>
Rale stood straight to his full height and his deep brown leather armor creaked with the motion.  He was a tall man with a wild mane of dark curly hair that rested lightly on his broad shoulders.  He was nearly twice the height of Palantha and easily as broad as twice her own shoulder width.  The lower half of his sharply featured face was spotted with a thin dark beard.  He stared curiously at Palantha, his emerald green eyes piercing the dark curls that hung across his face.  "I am your servant, my Queen."  He bowed again, with an almost animal grace.  His movements were swift and purposeful yet the formality of his bow seemed awkwardly placed on him.  Something learned but not enjoyed or even really understood.  A trick taught to a wild beast.  He spoke again, in a concerned whisper, "My Queen, where is the usual entourage?"
<br><br>
Palantha smiled with a far off but understanding look in her eye, "I was not accompanied my friend.  No one knows of my presence here."
<br><br>
Rale stepped towards her and tightened the grip on his staff, looking intently at the surrounding forest.  Despite her long friendship with him, she was on occasion intimidated by his size and decisiveness of motion.  As a human he was naturally taller than her, however, Rale was tall for even a human.  His height and broad frame easily overshadowed the largest of elves.  She had stood toe to toe with a Troll on many occasions without a so much as a wince and gutted Ogre's three times her size.  However, Rale's movements seemed that of a fearsome, cunning predator which still made her feel skittish around her friend at times.  Rale spoke in a low whisper, "Let me see you back to the palace my Queen.  Galarin will have my head if anything happens to you.  You never quite understood the dangers that being elven royalty imposes upon you."  He reached forward and lightly took her arm.  All pretense of formality gone, he began to pull her along behind him as he started off in the direction of the elven palace.
<br><br>
Planting her feet firmly, Palantha refused to move.  Rale could have easily dragged her along like nothing more than an empty burlap sack, but, sensing her reluctance he eased his grip.  She knew him well, and placing her unfounded intimidation aside, she turned to face him.  "I may have a certain disregard for my safety as Queen but, I am nonetheless a Queen, Rale."  She looked up at him with a glare and even the big man shrank back from her burning stare.  His brawn was no match for her fierce eyes.   "I wont be dragged around like a dog on a leash."
<br><br>
Rale returned her gaze.  From underneath the well traveled green cloak her royalty was evident.  She too wore leather armor but of a surpassing quality.  It was tooled with the unmistakable skill of an elven master.  Dragons wrapped menacingly around tall elven oaks, their tails extended the length of her arm and ancient elven designs adorned the length of each leg..  The light brown armor clung tightly to her lithe body and the emerald pommeled elven scimitar at her side reminded most men's eyes to not linger too long.  Her golden eyes burned furiously at him beneath her tightly pulled back hair of silken gold.  Back straight and nostrils flared, even from nearly three feet below his gaze she looked as though she were at eye level.  No doubt, he could feel that regal aura she radiated and see that warrior's look behind her eyes.  Rale spoke, "Forgive me Palantha, my intent is not to upset you.  I, of all people, know perfectly well that you are capable of seeing to your own safety.  But leaving the palace grounds without your escort is not the best decision."
<br><br>
Palantha's fiery eyes cooled and she smirked at Rale,  "They think I'm bathing in one of the northern springs.  They're probably still dutifully standing there.  Backs turned, on the other side of that hill I left them on."  Rale looked penetratingly at the armor and then turned his attention to her sword.  Palantha looked back, her eyes searching for his thoughts.  
<br><br>
"And they didn't notice you were armored and carrying Sul-Orn,"  Rale stated blandly.
<br><br>
Looking down, Palantha glanced at her armor and sword.  Of course she had worn them just in case she were waylaid on her journey through the forest alone.  She knew her guards had given her some odd looks at her choice of attire.  However, she had already seen to her guards curiosity.  She turned to Rale, her hand caressing the hilt of her sword,  "I told them I was ready to lop the head off of any of them that tried to see a little more of their Queen than they needed.  After what happened last night, they all took me quite seriously."
<br><br>
Rale raised his eyebrows,  "Now, I'm curious.  What happened?  Some eleven soldier boy get fresh with you?"
<br><br>
Sighing, Palantha sat down on the plush grass beside the pool's edge.  "Galarin's guards came into our room somewhat unexpectedly this morning.  I wasn't dressed for company I suppose I should say."
<br><br>
Rale chuckled, "I'd love to see the look on their faces.  I'm surprised those stalwart bodyguards didn't burn their own eyes out after that."
<br><br>
"Rale," a stern reprimand accompanied by an impatient look ended Rale's amusement.  "Look, that's not why  I came all the way out here.  The guards were there for a reason.  Galarin was screaming like a mad man.  They came to check on him."
<br><br>
Slowly, Rale lowered himself to the ground beside her.  Rale had known Galarin nearly as long as he had known Palantha.  Never had he known him to be anything remotely describable as "mad".  "What was wrong with him, Palantha?"
<br><br>
Palantha turned her head, looking Rale straight in the eyes,  "Rale, he's been having these dreams...or nightmares.  I don't think they are normal.  Something is behind it."
<br><br>
"Something?  What Palantha?  Could be the work of an Orcish shaman.  I hear some can actually dream walk though its not common....."
<br><br>
"It's not..." she paused, seeming to force herself to continue,  "not that simple.  Its something worse, Rale."  Rale's eyes widened.  The tone of her voice was ominous.  It spoke to him of something worse than he could think of.
<br><br>
She sat tight lipped for what seemed like hours.  Rale waiting for her every breath.  He was desperate to know what it was that could instill such fear into Palantha or even Galarin.  Palantha was the match of any swordsman he had ever met and Galarin was skilled enough with magery to have more than a few tricks up his sleeve.  He was a High Wizard of incredible knowledge and was renowned for his exceptional ability with magic. King Galarin had seen to the training of many of the Erudite's most accomplished mages.   This was King Galarin who led his troops into battle against the Trollish hordes and bathed the field in flame from dusk to dawn with Palantha at his side, cutting down trolls like rotted timber. What could this horrible evil be?   Finally, she spoke the word.
<br><br>
"Innoruuk." 

<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<br>
<font size="+2">3</font>
<p style="text-align: justify">
Rale led Palantha back through the deep greater Faydark forest in the direction of the elegant, tree woven walls of the Elven capital, Takish-Hiz.   Their journey through the forest was unnaturally silent.  As they traveled, Rale reached out with his druidic powers to the forest around him.  Through airborne bird and ground laden beasts, he scanned the trail ahead, nervous of what he might discover.  All remained as it had been however, quiet and serene.  The news from Palantha was far more than shocking and had put him on edge. Why would He choose to infect the elven King's dreams?  She had not said another word of it to Rale since they had left the pool and remained silent ever since the fiend's name escaped her lips. Innoruuk, Prince of Hate, Father of Pain.  Just the fact that she was willing to speak his name aloud gave Rale a deep sense of how desperate she was. After she uttered that foul name they had sat there by the gently moving pool for at least an hour, saying nothing.  Finally, Rale had stood and helped her to her feet and simply started walking back towards Takish-Hiz.  He was unsure what he could do.  Unsure what she was looking for or even expecting of him.  Neither had dared to speak until now,  both trying to absorb the impact of that one devilish name.  Innoruuk.
<br><br>
Rale spoke, trying to break the heavy and ominous silence.  "You say you left your guards at a northern pool?  Is it the one by the great Ironwood tree?"
<br><br>
Palantha's faraway gaze slowly returned to her immediate surroundings and she glanced at Rale.  "Yes, that's the one my friend."  The words barely escaping her tightly pursed lips. 
<br><br>
Rale stopped and Palantha continued walking a few paces ahead of him before stopping and turning to face him.  "Palantha, why me?  Why come to me for help?"  He could see in her eyes she was still reluctant to talk as she stared blankly back at him.
<br><br>
Rale continued feverishly, unleashing his thoughts in a torrent.  "I am your friend Palantha and Galarin's too.  I will give my life for you both, you know that.  I will do everything I can to help but...what can I do that a house of royal clerics cant?  The Sylvan Sisters of Erollisi Marr are at your command or the Elven Royal House's Clerics of Tunare. How am I to be of any service that they cant provide?  I will give you and Galarin my support and try to help you through this unfailingly.  However, if the Prince of Hate has crept into the King's dreams I'm afraid it isn't in my power to do anything about it." 
<br><br>
Palantha watched, unblinking.  Rale stepped closer and took hold of her hand, dropping to one knee. "I am the keeper of these woods, a druid and friend to nature.  I know nothing of the Prince of Hate.  I choose to live among this dense forest for it is here that such base emotions are for naught.  The trees feel no hatred, nor do the animal kin that inhabit these woods.  What is killed or what is maimed is done so out of hunger or fear...a need to survive.  There is no desire here to harm or reason to cause pain.  The Prince of Hate is a force of men and elves and dwarves and trolls and all things that may choose to invoke his power or not.  What is it I can do to stop his madness my Queen?  I who have chosen a life "
<br><br>
Blank expression replaced by a loving gaze, Palantha gracefully knelt beside him.  "I wasn't sure myself until now.  Rale, we need you for just those reasons you speak of.  Here you have escaped the influences of men.  Even as elves, our bonds to nature are severed by our thoughts and complicated desires; those very things that separate us from this world of yours.  Those same things that give an open path for Innoruuk into our hearts.  Perhaps here, Innoruuk cannot reach him."
<br><br>
Rale sat motionless, deep in thought.  He reached out once again to the forest.  In one moment he could sense the spreading of ancient roots and feel the success and failure of the forest's creatures to survive.  He could understand the thought of the methodical predator and feel the racing heart of it's prey.  Perhaps she was right.  Here, the hate did not exist; the madness that inflicts men, dwarves and elves alike.  The hate, the jealousy, the violence for sheer pleasure.  This is why he had chosen the forest as his eternal place of peace.  To live away from the chaos of the "civilized" beasts and to protect these woods from their intrusion.  Yes, it is true.  Hate does not exist here and if his friends were not free from Innoruuk's hand while sheltered in its boughs,  Innoruuk's power should be greatly diminished.

<p style="text-align: justify">
	Galarin drew his forest green robe around him and snatched up his staff.  A dark mahogany, gnarled staff veined with gold and silver.  At the top, a good head above his own, the twisting wood separated into a loop.  The golden veins that traced the contour of the staff filled the void in the loop, branching out from its edges in the intricate representation of a blazing sun.  Gripping his staff tightly, Galarin stepped out of his room.  He walked swiftly past his guards into the hallway and breathed a sigh at the rattle of metal behind him as they raced to accompany him.
<br><br>
	"I'm truly sorry my liege," one of them spoke above the clamor of the armored retinue behind him.  "She said she was going to bathe but never returned. I tried to find her.  I know that recently you have been more concerned with her safety and I.. I'm sorry my liege that I have failed......"
<br><br>
	Galarin interrupted the stammering soldier with a hiss, "Silence."  He stopped and turned, the score of elven knights that followed him coming to a stiff, jangling halt.  "I am aware of your failure, Lord Melius!" he turned his gaze slowly across the entire group, "all of you!  You are not fit to be of the Oaken Shield!"  The group turned their eyes to the ground under Galarin's vengeful stare.  He watched as their shoulders drooped at his words and was immediately sorry he had spoken them.  They were valiant knights, every one of them.  Their skill and grace with the sword was nearly unmatched in all of Norrath.  He knew they were all more than deserving of their posts.  Palantha was just so head strong.  He of all people understood their disappointment and frustration.
<br><br>
	Lord Melius, a dark-haired elf with broad shoulders strode forward and fell to one knee before Galarin.  "Forgive me my King."  Reaching up he tore a small golden brooch from his cloak, letting his green cloak slide down across his armor plates and  drop to the floor.  "Please, take it my king, I...."
<br><br>
	A musical voice chimed down the hallway followed by an audible sigh from a number of the rigid knights.  "So damn melodramatic Melius.  Get off the ground before my husband takes you up on removing your title."  Galarin whirled as Melius rose to his feet and exclaimed, "My Queen!"
<br><br>
	Galarin strode toward Palantha as she approached, "Palantha! Where have you been? I have died a thousands times since I heard you were missing!  I feared that...that he had somehow...."  Galarin stopped, forced to swallow hard.  He could not complete the horrible thought.  The forces that wished him harm had shown him a number of things in his dreams that he could not share.  Not even with Palantha.  No, especially not her.
<br><br>
	Palantha reached out and clutched his arm.  With a reassuring grasp she said, "They never would have agreed to let me roam the Greater Faydark, I had to, well, ditch them."
<br><br>
	"You are correct.  Nor would I have let you walk there whether alone or accompanied by your guards.  I have heard reports of gnolls along the fringes and the sprites and faeries aren't too keen on visitors.  They have been suspicious of even Elves of late for some reason.  The unpredictability of the woodland creatures is unsettling as well."
<br><br>
	Palantha looked up at him, "I'm more than capable of cutting a path through even an army of gnolls and we have nothing to fear from the woodland beings, you know that Galarin."  She sighed,  "This is precisely why I didn't tell you either."
<br><br>
	Galarin struggled to avoid beginning a lecture on the dangers of the greater Faydark.  As he looked into Palantha's eyes he knew she was expecting as much.  Her eyes had that defiant look in them that he knew so well.  A look that eagerly communicated that his logic would fall on deaf ears.  Instead of pressing the issue, he took a step back and asked, "But why there?  What did you seek?" 
<br><br>
	Palantha smiled.  Perhaps relieved at not having to listen to another quite reasonable lecture that Galarin knew would do her good.  If she would have been willing to listen of course.  "I was looking for Rale," she said.  "He is waiting in the royal antechamber as we speak."
<br><br>
	"Rale.  Rale, yes, it has been long since we have seen our dear friend.  Even longer still for him I imagine.  Seeing him will be a pleasure."  Galarin reached out and pulled Palantha  into his arms.  "I am more pleased to see you safe, however."
	<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<br>
<font size="+2">5</font>
<p style="text-align: justify">
	"No, Rale, I cannot,"  as he spoke, Galarin's lips drew into a tight frown.  
<br><br>
	"Galarin," Rale spoke informally with the King, ignoring Melius' frown.  "What I don't understand is why you haven't done this already?"
	<br><br>
	Galarin glanced grimly at Melius, "Leave us."  Melius stiffened to attention and bent with a rigid bow slowly backing out of the room.  When he reached the door he motioned for the two elven sentries to follow him.  The two sentries stepped toward him, each grabbing hold of one of the large oaken double doors and pulling them shut behind them.  Galarin stared briefly at the intricately carved Wildwood tree on the double doors that stretched from floor to ceiling.  It was a large and delicate carving with the trunk of the tree split in half by the doors and made whole as the doors closed together.   Raising his hand he began to chant softly and a glittering green glow surrounded him.  Rale and Palantha stared as the tree carved on the doors melded its two halves together. As Galarin chanted, sparks of the green energy shot off from the glowing cloud that surrounded him, striking the door.  As they struck the door, the tree began to pulse and writhe.  Roots shot out from its trunk, piercing the castle floor.  The meticulously carved branches shook free from the door, spreading toward them and sprouting broad leaves as they traveled.  Out across the room they floated until they hung graciously over Galarin's seat.   As they reached him, Galarin lowered his chant and the green glow that had once swirled about him, vanished.   "This will provide the secrecy we need."
<br><br>
	Palantha stared at her husband in amazement.  "I had no idea, Galarin."
<br><br>
	Galarin smiled warmly at her and Rale, who still sat gaping at the tree that spread out across the room.  "I can feel it Galarin," Rale spoke slowly, concentrating.  "It's… it's there."
<br><br>
	With a snap of his fingers Galarin erased the grin from his face and stared with a deadly seriousness at the two.  "I'm not performing a parlor trick for your amazement.  We have more important matters to discuss here I'm afraid.   Yes, Palantha, the door has always had these properties, I have had yet the occasion to invoke them.  Now, however, seems as good a time as any.  It will bar the possible intruder," He looked squarely at the door, now one solid piece, joined by the tree's trunk.  He then looked up at the lush branches above, "physical or otherwise."
<br><br>
	Rale tore his eyes off of the newly created tree before him and returned his gaze to Galarin who still stared sternly at the two.  His abundant, wispy eyebrows gave Galarin a certain aged look which his years did not own up to.  The slightly raised eyebrow and squinted eyes were typical of the reprimanding look he often flashed at Palantha, and now Rale as well.  He was a prudent and wise leader and well learned scholar but, as Palantha had often noted (many times among royal guests to Galarin's chagrin) he was a little "uptight".  Rale had always believed that a greater destiny had brought the two together, for despite their differences, they were bound by a deep passion.
<br><br>
	With the incredible display of the arcane arts now in the back of his mind, Rale continued his questioning, "Galarin, the clerics of Tunare at least should know of this!  Perhaps the Blessed Mother can provide the protection that is necessary to rid you of this evil."
<br><br>
	Galarin looked sternly at Rale and his face hardened beyond his normal stoic mask.  "Rale, the clerics can do nothing.  I cannot speak to them of this."
<br><br>
	"But, Galarin, surely you cannot ignore both of our voices,"  Palantha spoke with in a heavy whisper.  "I asked the same thing that Rale just did.  I've asked you hundreds of times to see the clerics.  Perhaps thousands.  And every time you stare at my as though I were a child and say the same thing.  Tell me now what it is that keeps you from following our advice."  Palantha rose, the volume of her voice rising with her.  "Tell me Galarin, tell me!"
<br><br>
	"The clerics.  One of them walks the path of hate my dear ."
<br><br>
	Rale firmly fixed his gaze on Galarin as Palantha slumped back into her chair, stunned.  Rale spoke cautiously as he stared, "How is this?  You mean of the royal elven house Clerics of Tunare?  One is pledged to…to Him?"
<br><br>
	With a concerned glance at his wife who now sat motionless and drained of color, Galarin replied, "Yes Rale.  It is true."
<br><br>
	"Damn it."  Palantha finally spoke and she spoke with a force summoned from deep within,  "Damn it!"  She rose again from the chair as color flooded into her cheeks and she gripped Sul-Orn, the masterfully crafted elven scimitar.  "Who Galarin?  Oh just tell me my dear so that I can bleed him before the eyes of his deity.  I will watch this idly no longer!"
<br><br>
	Death was in her voice.  Rale had heard her speak in the same ominous tone once before.  The night before the Siege of Zor-Carath, the Orc fortification.  To this day he could swear the elven forces merely watched as she charged mercilessly into a mass of Orcish warriors leaving nothing but their putrid corpses in her wake.  Those orcs had taken it upon themselves to pillage and decimate the population of a nearby elven colony.    Orcs had not been seen within twenty miles of Elven territory since.  Now evil had somehow burrowed itself into the heart of the Elven empire and penetrated its most sacred of orders.  What would she do to avenge this trespass?
<br><br>
	"I do not know who it is, Palantha."  
	<br><br>
	Palantha still stood menacingly above them both, staring eagerly at the door as if contemplating how best to sunder the thick Wildwood tree that barred her way.  
<br><br>
	Rale turned back to Galarin, "You know yet you don't? I don't understand."  Glancing up at Palantha again, Rale began to wonder if he could stop her if she decided to slaughter every cleric of Tunare within the Palace walls to find the traitor.
<br><br>
	"I cannot see who, but the signs are there.  I speak daily with the Prefect of the order and she has yet to give indication of anything out of the ordinary.  Yet, I know what the omens have shown me. There is a traitor among them and to escape detection this long, they may be near the top of the order.  Perhaps they know the Prince of Hate's plans and are counting on me seeking the counsel of the clerics. Thus,  they can intervene and carry out the next phase of their master's plan.  No, I cant speak to them.  I just don't know enough to risk exposing this."   Galarin looked at both Rale and Palantha weighing their reaction.  Nodding, as if seeing what he sought, he pointed to the center of the room.  "Watch as I reveal the omen to you."
<br><br>
	 Rale looked at Palantha, still seemingly absorbed in a precariously managed rage.  Galarin was not known to share the omens which his powerful magic made him privy to.  Rale had heard they required great energy of a mage, some nearly dying as they struggled with the extra-planar forces, trying to wrench the most arcane of secrets from them.  
<br><br>
	 Without standing, Galarin tapped his staff harshly on the floor.  Filling the room was a lightly dancing chime that faintly reminded Rale of the delicate jingle of pixie bells.  As they sung, the sun mounted atop Galarin's staff flashed with a brilliance that filled the room.  In an instant the light was gone, replaced by a swirling vision; The temple of The Great Mother, Tunare. It was the very temple that sat on the Palace grounds.  A sculpted mass of tree trunks, guided and grown over the years to form a bell-shaped structure which exploded at its peak with broad, deep green leaves of all variety.  The temple was rumored to have taken three thousand years to create and was presumably begun the moment Tunare gave birth to her Children, the Elves.  The first elf planted a sapling among a barren plain, in honor to her mother and from it sprang the Faydark forest.  She nurtured the original tree and as it grew she was slowly revealed a powerful vision.  The vision of the House of Tunare; Her home on Norrath where Her worshippers could freely walk and commune with Her presence.  That was the elegant shape that sat floating before the three of them in the center of the swirling vision.  Trees turned and spun, guided as a growing child to become, carefully forming the walls, towers and windows of the massive structure.    Tunare had supposedly been pleased with her children's work and blessed the temple so that no matter how harsh the winter it always grew and held its lush green canopy high above the elven city.   Rale looked longingly at it and even Palantha seemed to relax her gaze and with a sigh took in the beauty of the temple.  The temple was always breath taking, regardless of the fact that it could be plainly seen from the Palace gardens.    
<br><br>
	Sweat broke on his brow and Galarin spoke.  "Watch closely.  The omen I have witnessed shall unfold itself here, for you to interpret."  Gripping the staff he chanted and as he spoke something else became apparent on the image.  A deep green vein of energy, pulsing with life, appeared above the temple.  It began to solidify, wrapping tightly around the elegant mass of trees.  "The benevolence of Tunare," spoke Galarin in a pained voice.  "Now look.  Look!  It is challenged from below!"  The image became closer and sharper, approaching at a blinding speed.  Closer to the weave of ancient tree trunks, closer to the deep green grass that surrounded it.  It slowed and narrowed, spinning violently.  Rale shook his head to clear it and forced his gaze back to the vision. It was now deep in the earth below the tree, the deep green vein swirling among the roots dizzyingly.  Suddenly, it stopped.  There a large root glistened before them.  It throbbed with an irregular rhythm and shot downward, deep into the earth.  Here the swirling green vein could not reached and tapered off as it struggled to complete its journey along the depth of the root  The vision traced the root, spiraling along its depths.  Again Rale shook his head and continued watching the vision through squinted eyes, straining to maintain his orientation.  The root broke free from soil and rock into a deep cavern, running down the cavern wall into a pool.  A dark and thick pool whose contents congealed heavily on the walls of the cavern.   A scream pierced the air, ripping through the silence in the room like a sharp toothed saw.  The scream came again as the root bulged fetidly and took in the thick contents of the pool.  
<br><br>
	Quickly, Palantha spoke as if to combat the shrill scream, "You have seen this before Galarin??  What is it the omen speaks to us now?"  
<br><br>
	There was no reply.  Nothing but a hollow clatter as Galarin's staff struck the floor.  Rale rose to face him, tearing his eyes from the dizzying vision. Palantha whirled to look at Galarin.  He sat limply in the plush velvet chair that held him, looking almost as if he could slide effortlessly to the floor.  His eyes were wide and glassy, fixed on the vision ahead.  
<br><br>
	"Galarin!"  Palantha lept forward, sliding to a halt beside her husband.
<br><br>
	He sat motionless, bathed in sweat.  Through struggling breaths he spoke, "No….the omen…no…the…the nightmare."  Palantha, still kneeling beside Galarin, turned rapidly to face the image once again.   The scream sounded again and Rale watched Palantha's eyes widen.  He hesitated to turn, not wanting to see the source of the bone chilling noise.  The screaming suddenly ceased, replaced by a bubbling gurgle.  
<br><br>
	"Tunare, protect us."  Palantha muttered.
<br><br>
	Rale turned, his heart racing.  The image had changed slightly.  In it could be seen the entire cavern, lit by a dim glow.  Rale heard a steady dripping sound replace the silence and his eyes reluctantly followed.  The thick pool sat stagnant against the edge of a short ravine, its surface slightly disturbed by the source of the dripping.  Its deep red banks swelled with each drop and they struck the surface of the pool with a thick slap.  Hanging just over the ravine's edge was a dark table of jagged obsidian.   The end that hung over the rough lip of the ravine bore a runnel, angled slightly downward into the pool.  This was the source of the dripping fluid.  A pungent coppery smell suddenly filled the room mixed with the dank oppressive odor of the rotting roots in the sealed cavern.  Rale turned to look at Palantha but the vision had taken in the entire room.  He now stood in the pool, ankle deep.  Around him he could hear a faint slurping noise, as if he could hear the roots that lined the cavern slowly draining the pool.  He looked down and raised his foot, the liquid clinging to him like a putrid, dark red slime.  He felt is stomach turn as he watched it slide back into the pool.  Rushing to the edge of the waist high ravine he threw himself out of the mire landing face down on the slick cavern floor.  Tunare, sweet Tunare, what is that?  Behind him he could hear a faint sobbing.  He knew it but it was awkward sounding.  Familiar yet something he had never actually heard but perhaps imagined.  Palantha?  He raised his head slowly, pushing himself to his knees as he rose.  Beside him was the obsidian table, slanted down to point in to the pool.  A steady flow of dark red liquid now pulsed into the pool.  It flowed rhythmically into the mire adding  to the contents.
<br><br>
	Blood.
<br><br>
	"No.  No. Tunare, shelter me."  Rale whispered, slowly rising to his feet and staring with a morbid fascination at the table.
<br><br>
	At one end knelt a sobbing figure.  It was Palantha.  In her hand was Sul-Orn, coated in a thick membrane of fresh blood.  Something dark, a large rock perhaps, rested in the corner.  Rale strode forward to reach out to Palantha, "It's ok.  It's ok."  He stopped as he took note of another figure slumped haphazardly against the far side of the table.  Beside it lay Galarin's wooden staff, coated in blood, the glistening sun resting in a congealing pool of blood.  The figure was adorned in his robes, spattered with fresh blood.  He stared is it jerked awkwardly.  Following it from the floor to the edge of table, he turned and fell to his knees.  It was the source of the stream of blood that pumped down the table.  The image would not leave his eyes even as he ground them shut.  Galarin leaning forward over the table, his decapitated body forcing its blood out into the deep, inky pool of blood.
