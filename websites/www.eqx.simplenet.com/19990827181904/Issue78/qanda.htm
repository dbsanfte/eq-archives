<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a Lvl 5 Wizard. In Ak'anon, at the Library of Mechanamagica I hailed Tobon Starpyre and got "Joined the Eldritch Collective" back as a key phrase. When I responded with the phrase and a question mark I got no response whatsoever. So, I don't know if I'm at too low a level, its a bug, phrasing was wrong, or what. I also tried saying "What is Joined the Eldritch Collective"..nothing.Yet when I right click I am able to train, so I must have a Wizard NPC. ????? 
- Garlain

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes you have to do more than repeat the phrase.  I don't know what the exact phrasing of the NPC's words were, but I would think that if it was indeed a key phrase (ie. capitalized or in parenthesis) then "I have joined the Eldritch collective" might get results.  Try several different ways of saying the words back to him.  People tend to give up too easily.  =)
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any way to tell if a piece of jewelry or a stone has magical properties?  There are lots of jewelers in Norrath, but none of their pieces show any thing besides weight and cost.  Sense Magic will probably work, but is there another way? 
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the jewelry was made with enchanted silver, it will not be magical.  And any jewelry that is magical will show as such in a right click.  Enchanted silver is regular silver that has been enchanted by an Enchanter.
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Dark Elf, Shadow Knight making me a very mean and nasty person. However, I am often accused of ruining the game for others due to my mean behavior in the game. I am of course role-playing, and they do not understand this. How can I communicate to these fools that I am just doing what I am supposed to do? 
- Eidolon
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Verant has actually made a RP "switch" for this very reason.  You can turn your name a purple color in game so as to let people know that you are roleplaying. What will they think of next?
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the mana stat (int or wis) increase meditation speed or casting ability?  If it only increases mana capacity, that is a good advantage but not all-important.  However, if a character with higher mana total meditates full just as fast, or has more powerful spells, putting points in anything else is an absolute waste.  I need to know if it is safe to put points into other stats. 
- Mitey

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana stats affect your mana pool, and also how fast you scribe/memorize/cast spells.  It will not affect the amount of dmg/buffing your spell do.  Medding rate won't be affected, so far as I know.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm one of the new players from England, I've been playing a couple of weeks and cannot get enough of the game. I have a level 4 Wizard and Level 6 Bard as my two main characters. The Rulebook in the English version is flimsy and almost useless, where can I get more information and books? 
- Tiberious

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a copy of the rules/instructions in your Everquest folder.  eqmanual.txt, or something similar... It's updated every time you patch.  Also, <a href=http://www.eqvault.com>www.eqvault.com</a> has a large amount of resources.  Check out the left hand side of the page, all that tiny lil writing.  Class, race, magic guides.  Pretty much all you need.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What type of magical force is in existence in Norrath that provides every woman with enormous breasts? And is it possible to bring that force into "our" world? 
- Veorn

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ummmm...only if you can also bring the magical force that allows them to stand upright without breaking their backs...
<br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in Qeynos and my friend just started playing and he is in Halas.  I want to go find him but I keep running into Mountains when I go north.  How do I get to Halas? 
- Havena


</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the only way to get to Halas is through the dreaded lair of the Blackburrow Gnolls.  I'm sure that you can find a guide ingame to show you the way.  Just ask any Barbarian you see.  They must have been through there.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hallloo me be Faboo, me be big troll shadowknight, me be in Human area, me be hunting gnolls for past 4 levels, how long you think me needs keel dem gnolls? 
- Faboo


</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm, as a Troll SK you may never get more from the population of Qeynos than a dubious stare.  You ARE after all, an Evil race and class combo, and no one ever said it would be easy...
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a Lvl6 Erudite Mage. I've noticed that my higher skills have topped off at 35. No matter how many times I preform the skill my level doesn't raise. Are the skills connected to my level, and start to raise again when I level up ? 
- Ebinoa

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, skill lvl is directly related to your character's level. Other than a few exceptions, which slip my mind...but any skill that relates to combat will be character lvl based.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Terminology:  What is MOB?  What does it mean to 'Train' a creature on someone else?  What's the difference from causing a 'train' on yourself?  What is 'twink'ing?  What is SoW?  What's the difference between somoeone with SoW cast on them and someone that has absolutely no items in their inventory? (or just food and water)  Why does it say Sense Healing increases quickly?  How do you practice 'Safe Fall' without feeling like a lemming?  
- Torch

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whew!  Ok here goes:  MOB - no one really seems to know...Mobile?  Monster On Berserk?  It comes from the earliest MUDs, that much I DO know.  Any of you readers out there know the Real True Origin?  Lemme know if so!

To "train" a creature on someone else is to attract a MOB, then run away, and by running close to another player, dumping it on them.  Training on yourself is the same thing, except you don't lose the MOB onto someone else.
<br><br>
Twinking is any higher lvl player giving items to lower lvl players to give them a "leg-up" so to speak.  It was illegal in Beta, due to the fact that Verant was trying to balance the game, and twinking interfered with the data they needed.  Nowadays it is not illegal, but not really approved of either.  Some items have been "lvl-rated" ie, they don't work, or work only in a limited manner for chars who aren't high enough lvl to aquired the item through normal gameplay.
<br><br>
SoW is Spirit of Wolf, a druid/shaman spell that increases a char's running speed.  It is way better than simply running around "naked".
<br><br>
Um, Sense Healing? you must mean Sense Heading.  I have never found it increased quickly...
<br><br>
The only way to practice safefall, other than at your Guild trainer, is to throw yourself of small ledges, take small dmg, repeat. Go, lemming, go!

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like some good links to sites that explain some of the magic items and weapons that can be found in everquest, and what the stats on those items are. I hear people asking for items i have never heard of like runes and bloodstained armor. I would like to know what these items do. For example i have a rune of falhalsm that i got of a deepwater croc in oasis or marr, but i have no idea what it does.Thanks 


</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I left off the name of the questioner here on purpose.  Let me just reiterate:  Q&A is not a hint/spoiler page.  Nor do we provide links to such.  Find out for yourselves.  That's where all the fun is!
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you put text in the "View Equipment" box.  I've seen others with glowing descriptions of themselves and some with stuff like "^b ^b."  All I want to say is:  "She's sweet but she'll still make you cry." 
- Vidalia

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;To put text into the Bio box, as I call it, just go to any outside view, right click on yourself as if inspecting equipment, and then just type.  The text will show in the box.
<br><br>
And a few corrections.  Thanks guys!  Someday I will be the Great Goddess of EQ Knowledge, I swear...
<br><br>
<em>Isara, Seneschal of the Soerbaird - Fennin Ro</em>	 Hail! I would like to correct you on your answer to a question in Issue 77, in which someone asks the effects of Charisma on a bard's performance. Well, the more charismatic you are, the more pleasing your performance, the more well liked you are. And the more well-liked you are, the more confident you can be, thereby decreasing the chance of missing a note when you begin to sing your songs. You know, no shaking hands and quavering voices and all that.
