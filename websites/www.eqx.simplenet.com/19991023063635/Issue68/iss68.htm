   The trip back to Kelethin was swifter than her previous journey.  Though untutored and incapable of performing the magic himself, Amgho learnt the drumming song quickly, and his voice supported hers in her songweaving.  They nearly flew through the countryside.  The grass at the side of the road bent over in the wind of their passage.   The travel that had taken her four days to complete alone, was over in two and a half.  They arrived at Kelethin late in the afternoon of the third day.

 "<em>The shadow factor is rarely recorded by the bards and sages of an era. Common folk believe in the grandiose and the straightforward. The legendary events of the past are always sung in the simplest possible terms. What they fail to mention is that heroes and villains are typically prodded to action by forces which cannot be morally classified…"

Reminding me I've spent another night awake in my chambers<br>
Secretly coveting the words of the Goddess Erollisi Marr<br>
While balancing my duty to my creator, my patron Tunare.

Sometimes the very best of what cooperation and loyalty are about are found in the events in Norrath. Often they speak louder than words for what is good in Norrathians.

This happened just the other day, and demonstrates my point.

<center><big><b>Two Weeks in Rallos Zek</big></center></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="-1">
	Despite the server problems these past weeks I was actually able to log in over 48 hours of game play in the first seven days, and this was around school and work. Since then I have been able to play a lot more.  As you can tell by the title I chose to play on Rallos Zek, the PvP (although we call it the RP) server.  I chose to play on this server for a lot of reasons. I also had a lot of presuppositions on what the server might actually be like, and most of them turned out to be wrong. Rallos Zek is not the most popular server so far, but I think it has merit and I certainly hope that Verant decides to keep it. Here are some observations that I have made after the first week that I thought I would share with people who are curious to know what is going on there.

Well, it seems that my gaming companions are complaining now that I don't write about them anymore.  I always thought that they hated the fact that I mentioned them.  But I guess they miss the limelight, if you're generous or deluded enough to think that this editorial could be considered the limelight.  I would have thought it was more like the quicklime, but then I'm a bit harsh.

I just did something today that really bothered me.  I put someone on my ignore list.  While this may not bother many of you (in fact my adventuring buddy already has 12 on his list), it bothers me.  I try pretty hard to be civil and open and fun to everyone I meet, but this time I had just had enough.

<em>As much as I am looking forward to the release of EverQuest, I have one major concern.  That is the issue of "unrealistic riches".  What I mean by this is, will every player I encounter be loaded up with the highest levels of equipment, spells and abilities within 5 minutes of the game being released?</em>
