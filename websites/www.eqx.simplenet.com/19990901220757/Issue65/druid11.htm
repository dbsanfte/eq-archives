<br><br>
   The air warped and shifted around Innoruuk, hiding the twisted features of the Dark Elf whose body he wore.  Reality bent and the rock beneath the Goddess turned misty, then writhed up in long ropes to wrap about her, lashing her from head to toe.  Before they stilled, however, they flexed and then exploded.  Rock shards flew in every direction, lacerating the Surefall denizens.  
<br><br>
   "Run, my children!" the Goddess said urgently.  "You cannot help me here."  Innoruuk advanced on her and she circled warily around the bloodied altar. 
<br><br>
   Anthiel strove against Freygar's implacable grip, digging at the floor with his feet.  All about them, Druids and Rangers fled the room. A tortured grinding of rock under stress began to rise.  Freygar dragged the High Elf after them, making for the door.  He started across the walkway, and a particularly strong lunge of Anthiel's nearly took them over the edge.  They wavered for a moment on the brink and then found their footing again.  Freygar furiously yanked Anthiel's face up to his.
<br><br>
   "Are you trying to kill us?  We have to go!"
<br><br>
   "I abandoned her once, Freygar.  I can't do it again." Anthiel's voice was frantic.  Innoruuk screamed in pain or frustration.  
<br><br>
   "Are you mad?  They are Gods, Anthiel! What can we do?"  He caught hold of the Elf again, and urged him to the door.  
<br><br>
   "They are mortal!  She can be hurt, and therefore healed.  I am staying!  Let go!"  The slight Elf was making little headway against the barbarian.  They were almost to the door.  He twisted like an eel and nearly won free.
<br><br>
   "Hold him, barbarian."  Freygar turned to see Te'Anara at his elbow.
<br><br>
   "You!" The Elf spat.  "You knew this would happen.  All this...to make her ready for the Goddess.  To make her the perfect vessel."
<br><br>
   "Yes!"  Her face burned with fear and fervor.  The room shook.  The Goddess cried out.  Anthiel wrenched around, struggling.  Freygar subdued him ruthlessly.  "It was necessary.  She swore herself to Tunare's service years ago.  That was not an oath taken lightly, nor one that can be broken.  Tunare called her.  I wish it could have been otherwise, truly I do.  Would you have had the world burn?"   Anthiel cast a wild look at Te'Anara.  "She is not dead, Cleric."  Te'Anara laid a hand on his cheek.  He jerked his face away.  "You may yet be able to tell her what you feel.  But you cannot interfere."  Anthiel closed his eyes in pain.  "We must go."
<br><br>
<hr color="brown">
<p style="text-align: justify">
   Innoruuk warped the world, and Tunare grimly countered each move, righting the balance, restoring the natural order.  Aklar drifted in the glowing void, aware of the battle, aware of each person in the chamber.  She felt their fear as they fled, knew Anthiel's anguish and anger, Freygar's sorrowed determination.  Te'Anara's guilt and hope were there, too, like small pockets of sensation in the back of her mind.  She just... knew.  The Goddess held her gently as a babe, shielded from Innoruuk's evil.
<br><br>
   Slowly the glow began to pulse and waver.  The Goddess was hurt, and with each new blow the glow faded slightly and each time was slower to regain its strength.  Innoruuk was winning.  Fear threaded through the void, and Aklar began to stir, struggling to surface, to see.  The Goddess pushed her firmly down.
<br><br>
   <em>Stay safe, my daughter</em>!
<br><br>
   <em>Safe? This is my body he is trying to kill</em>!
<br><br>
   The Goddess gave way.  The world swam into focus as Aklar looked out of her eyes again. 
<br><br>
   The stone walls of the room were rent and twisted, great roots and vines pushing through the rock to grasp at Innoruuk.  Lightning rained down on him, winds howled around him, pushing him back from the Goddess, and the air itself turned to ice, freezing along his limbs.  Yet even as Aklar watched, he shrugged off each attack, withering the vines and ignoring the elements.  A great ripple of darkness came out from him, shivered through the air and struck Tunare.  Aklar felt the wracking pain, but distantly, and heard her own voice scream in pain.  
<br><br>
   Out of the corner of her eye she saw Anthiel struggling with Freygar, facing down Te'Anara.  <em>Run</em>! She willed him urgently. <em>Goddess, get them away</em>!
<br><br>
  <em>They have their fight, daughter, as I have mine.  I can spare nothing, and if I lose... one life saved will not matter.  Be at peace.  Let me fight</em>!
<br><br>
   The Goddess summoned a whirlwind of fire, sent it springing up from the ground at Innoruuk's feet.  The body of D'anok blackened and withered in the flames, but Innoruuk merely laughed.  Not bothering to move, he gazed at Tunare in contempt.  
<br><br>
   "If that is the best you can do, Great Mother, then this will be much shorter than I had hoped.  I think I have played long enough.  It is time to finish this."  He raised his arms, burning shreds of cloth falling from them as he moved.  Black flames quenched the red, sheathing him in writhing snakes of darkness.  The skin on his face cracked and bled as he smiled.  Black fire sped out from him in straight lines across the floor, hit the walls, and raced up to the ceiling to converge over his head.  A twisting cone of night slowly descended, meeting his hands.  The air darkened.  "Know my power!"
<br><br>
   Hate flooded Aklar, angry red waves of fury and loathing.  The Goddess staggered and fell against the wall. 
<br><br>
<hr color="brown">
   <p style="text-align: justify">
   Freygar had Anthiel nearly to the door, with Te'Anara close behind, when the line of black fire shot in front of them, blocking their way.  It sank into the floor, cracking and snapping.  The air above it wavered and warped.  Freygar backed away, his eyes stinging.  Te'Anara gasped and choked at the fumes.
<br><br>
  "Know my power!" The God's voice hammered the room, deafening them.  Freygar let go of Anthiel and clutched at his ears.  Te'Anara fell to her knees, arms wrapped around her head.  Anthiel took a wavering step toward the altar, face distorted, only to find his way blocked by the same dark fire.  Then their sight dimmed, and the wave of hatred and rage beat them to the ground.  Freygar cried out, a lost wail of fear and hurt.  Te'Anara made no sound at all.  Anthiel lay on the cracked stone, barely feeling it against his cheek.  He was blinded, lost, alone with the enormity of Innoruuk's hate.  It seeped into his soul, blackening all it touched.  He fled, down to his core, where he found one last bastion of hope and light.
<br><br>
   His love for Aklar burned there, white and pure, and he hid inside it.  The darkness beat against that lone spar of light, trying to drown it, and was defeated.  Anthiel opened his eyes again.  His sight cleared a bit, and he forced himself up, shaking and sick, to his hands and knees.
<br><br>
   By the altar, the Goddess slumped against the wall, some inner battle showing on her face with brutal clarity.  She was a dim light in the gloom, a lost willowisp throwing its futile glow against the night.  Innoruuk loomed over her, savage glee on D'anok's twisted features.  
<br><br>
   Anthiel pushed at the ground again and got unsteadily to his feet.  The air weighed like lead, dragging at his limbs.  He came to the low-burning line of fire, paused as the acrid smoke burned his eyes, laid hooks into his throat and lungs.  Hacking, he stepped over it.  The heat prickled his skin.  The Goddess bowed her head, straining away from Innoruuk's claws.  They hovered near her throat, and now as he approached, Anthiel could hear him, his fevered raspy breathing, could smell the decay and the burnt-meat stench of his flesh.  Retching, he fell against the altar.  Innoruuk whirled from his prey, and Anthiel was struck to the marrow with fear as those pits of fire focused on him.  The Goddess looked up, and he tore his gaze from the Dark God's to look again on Aklar's beloved features.  The Goddess looked out of that face, but for one second, her eyes faded from silver to dark brown, and Aklar looked back at him.  Those eyes were lost in hate and fear, and he realized, finally, why his God had sent him here, halfway across the world, to fall in love with a woman not even of his own race.  Te'Anara was right.  The Gods called and you answered.  
<br><br>
   "Aklar," his voice cracked with fatigue and effort.  "I love you."
<br><br>
<hr color="brown">
<p style="text-align: justify">
   Aklar was lost.  The soothing glow of the Goddess' presence had turned red and shot with black.  The Dark God's power beat all around her, walling her in.  She called out in fear and horror, and there was no response.  She was falling again, down and down, and no Goddess waited at the end of this plummet, no loving Mother to cradle her.  The Goddess was dying, and Aklar was powerless to prevent it.
<br><br>
   <em>My daughter</em>... Faint as mist, gone before it fully registered.  Aklar groped, reaching out, but it was vanished.  Down and down.
<br><br>
   <em>Find faith... find love...</em>  Barely there at all, a fading whisper.  Aklar wept in the dark.  Faith? Love?  There was only the dark, and the tainted touch of Innoruuk.
<br><br>
   Then the oppressive weight lifted slightly.   A glimmer swam toward her, a flicker of the warm presence of Tunare.  It reached her, wrapped her up, and she was hurled out into the world again.  
<br><br>
   The stone wall was cold against her back though the air was hot and arid.  Innoruuk was before her, back turned, and just beyond him, slumped across the altar, was Anthiel.  His fair hair was disheveled, his crystal blue eyes bloodshot and his face bloody from a long, jagged cut down one side, but he was beautiful, heartbreakingly so.  He looked past the Dark God as if he didn't exist, and gazed directly into her eyes.
<br><br>
   "Aklar."  His voice was abused, but it fell on her ears like music.  "I love you."
<br><br>
   She opened her heart, finally, and let him in.  The chains of darkness and fear fell away from her and left her free.
<br><br>
<hr color="brown">
<p style="text-align: justify">
   "NO!" Innoruuk's voice did not deafen, it overwhelmed all senses. Freygar and the Head Druid were knocked unconscious, scudding across the floor to end up piled against the wall.  Anthiel was lifted off his feet and blown back against the wall with the power of it.  He crashed into the stone and fell limply to the floor.
<br><br>
   "Anthiel!" screamed Aklar.  The Goddess surged inside of her.  She could feel Tunare rushing back up, trying to regain control, but Aklar was fire, was raging incandescent fury and love and grief, and she would not be subdued.   The altar cracked in two, and the black fires winked out, as Innoruuk wheeled around at her again.  
<br><br>
   She rose up, launching from the wall in a smooth motion to strike him full in the chest.  She bore him across the broken altar, slamming him into the wall.  It gave under her thrust, softened, opened to let him in, and then closed.  He screamed again, but his voice was less this time, wracked with pain and helpless fury. Aklar backed away, panting, shaking.  The rock heaved, and his cry was now the purely mortal sound of a being in its last extreme.  The grisly sound of bones breaking overrode it.  The burning pits that had been D'anok's eyes glared at her.
<br><br>
   "It is not over..." he managed, and then the rock closed over the ruined face.  
<br><br>
   A great shudder went through the stone walls, and then a rush of air.  The smell of death was strong in the wind, and then it was gone.  The pale glimmering of the water down below slowly returned.  The Goddess gently urged Aklar, and she spread her arms wide, and opened her hands.  The light that was the Goddess flowed through her in a torrent, and all about her blue light fountained in the air, rained from the scarred ceiling, surrounded each one of the fallen.  Freygar lifted his head first, and then Te'Anara.  Anthiel never stirred.
<br><br>
   <em>Thank you, my child.  I will be with you, always.  You are the Avatar, now.</em>   The Goddess retreated until all Aklar could feel was a dim presence, a promise of light.  Aklar took a step toward Anthiel. He was still and silent, and his eyes stared unblinkingly into hers.
<br><br>
   "No," she said, her voice breaking.  "Oh, no, please, Goddess."  She fell to her knees beside him.
<br><br>
   "Anthiel?" said Freygar, and lurched to his feet.  Aklar touched Anthiel's face gently, smoothed back a lock of fair hair that had fallen forward.  Freygar collapsed beside her.
<br><br>
   "Ah, Gods..." The huge barbarian put his hands to his face and wept.  Aklar willed her own tears to come, but her eyes remained dry.  Her heart ached, her soul hurt, but all she could do close his eyes softly, holding the lids so they would not open again.  His skin was still warm.  
<br><br>
   She threw back her head and howled her grief.  Every bear in Surefall echoed the cry, and the mighty chambers of Mammoth's maze shook and reverberated.
<br><br>

<br><br>
   The battle was over.   Wizards and other spell casters wandered the broken ground, burning the Gnoll bodies to ash.  Others gathered the fallen.  Blood stained the ground and the trampled grass.  
<br><br>
   "The only thing sadder than a battle lost is a battle won," said Bayle wearily.  He leaned on his great sword, surveying the clean up.  
<br><br>
   "Indeed," sighed Gahlith.  He sat on the hilltop next to Bayle, staff across his knees.  He too, bore signs of the long struggle.  Dark pouches ringed his bloodshot eyes, and soot marked his robes.  The fighting near the end had been harsh.  The Gnolls, sensing defeat, had fought with suicidal fury. A commander and three shamans had made it through to Bayle's position.  
<br><br>
   "I still don't understand how the High Shaman got them to leave the Burrow and come all the way over here,"  Bayle shifted with a sound of stressed metal.  Gahlith winced.
<br><br>
   "Some sort of courage spell, I would presume.  Import from Neriak," Gahlith rubbed his hand across his eyes.
<br><br>
   "So we can expect this to happen again?" Bayle glared down at his old friend.
<br><br>
   "They took heavy losses," Gahlith began, gesturing at the ravaged field before them.
<br><br>
   "It will happen again." Bayle said flatly.
<br><br>
   "When they have their numbers again...most likely we will see an increase in Gnoll activity outside the Burrow, yes."
<br><br>
   "Why did I ever think I wanted this job?" Bayle pinched the bridge of his nose.
<br><br>
   "M'Lord!  Honoured First!"  A young messenger came panting up.
<br><br>
   "Well?" Gahlith rose painfully to his feet.
<br><br>
   "There was a...something has happened inside the Glade!  When the message was sent in that the battle was over, there was no one there.  And the Great Tree was...it looked almost...dead."  He finished in a whisper.  Bayle was already pushing past him, heading for the Surefall entrance at a dead run.
<br><br>
   Gahlith caught up to him as he entered the Glade.  The place was deserted.   The Great Tree loomed over them, its bark dark and peeling, leaves wilted.  One detached as they stared, horrified, and drifted slowly to the ground.  It was the only movement.
<br><br>
   "NO!"  It was a wall of sound, a shattering, devastating invasion.  They stumbled backward, grimacing.  Its echoes died, and they glanced at each other, eyes wide as children.
<br><br>
   "What...what was that?"  Bayle asked unsteadily.
<br><br>
   "I don't know,"  Gahlith closed his eyes for a brief moment.  "Morna is not responding…"
<br><br>
   "What do I keep you around for, anyway?"  Bayle muttered, and broke into a run again.  He splashed across the pond, Gahlith in tow, and entered the caves.  Druids and Rangers were everywhere, lying unconscious on the stone, praying or weeping.  Gahlith knelt by Morna, who sat against a wall, knees up and head buried in her arms.  She lifted a tearstained face to him.  Bayle grabbed a Ranger by the arm and shook him violently.  
<br><br>
   "What happened here?" he shouted at him.  The man didn't flinch.  He had the look of someone who had seen too much.
<br><br>
   "The Goddess manifested," he said wonderingly.  "I ran..." Bayle flung him aside, and pushed through the crowd.  Gahlith was ahead of him, leading him unerringly through the winding tunnels.  They came upon the doorway, ran through, and then stopped.
<br><br>
   The room was a ruin.  The walls and ceiling gaped with cracks and holes where the rock had caved in,  black pitted lines ran across the stone, and an acrid stink hung in the air.  The Head Druid was getting unsteadily to her feet a few paces over.   A Human woman and Freygar knelt by the cracked and broken altar.  Freygar was hunched, weeping over a fallen High Elf who lay sprawled against the far wall.   The Human stared across the floor at Gahlith, but her expression said clearly that she did not see him.  Her eyes looked into the far distance, and in them was such a depth of sorrow... 
<br><br>
    The Head Druid looked over to the altar.  Bayle turned to her, reached out a hand, but she brushed it aside, stood up, and made her way across the walkway.
<br><br>
   "Avatar," she said.  Bayle stepped forward, mouth falling open.  Gahlith seized his arm.  "Aklar," she said, more softly.  The young woman looked up at Te'Anara like one waking from a dream. 
<br><br>
   "Te'Anara," said Aklar, and stood.  She had surprising dignity, even in her dazed state. 
<br><br>
   "Avatar," said the Head Druid again, and then knelt at her feet.  Aklar stared at her silently, aghast, and then looked across at Gahlith.  Her eyes were...Gahlith fought the urge to drop his gaze, to kneel to her as the Druid had done.  He became aware of others in the room.  All around him, Druids and Rangers were bowing, kneeling, paying homage to the sooty and bedraggled girl.  
<br><br>
<hr color="brown">
    <p style="text-align: justify">
   Aklar looked around at her friends with horror. Nothing had prepared her for this.  
<br><br>
   "Don't..." she faltered. "Please....Te'Anara...." she tugged futilely at the woman before her.  "Stand up.  Ren, Garon..."  She reached out a hand to the massed Druids.  "Stand up."
<br><br>
   "Blessed by the Goddess, vessel of her divine power,"  Te'Anara looked up, and Aklar's panic increased.. 
<br><br>
   "Oh, no..." breathed Aklar, backing away.   The First Wizard was looking at her now with an expression of mixed disbelief and awe. She could not bear this, not now.  "Freygar," she pleaded.  The barbarian seemed not to hear.
<br><br>
   "Avatar, the Great Tree," began Te'Anara. 
<br><br>
   <em>Yes, the Tree.</em>   A sudden pain stabbed her in the side.  She gasped and hunched over, cradling her left side.  No, she wanted to stay with Anthiel, to grieve...
<br><br>
  <em>Holy Mother, let me grieve for him at least</em>! The pain twisted, sank deeper into her flesh.  She stumbled away from the altar, away from Anthiel.  She had to...she broke into a run, pushing through the crowd as they got to their feet in confusion.  She made her way through the tunnels, running faster now.  The walls became blurred in her speed.   
<br><br>
   Outside, the sky was paling toward morning.  She stopped on the lip of the cave, staring across the clearing.  She could see the top of the Tree.  It looked... wrong somehow.  
<br><br>
   Aklar stepped out and was not surprised when her foot never reached the water.  She walked over the pond slowly, leaving a wake of ripples.  She heard the gasps and murmurs behind her as the crowd of Surefall residents came to the waterfall.  They followed her, splashing and calling to her.  She ignored them.  Her focus had narrowed to include only one thing.  The Tree called to her, its pain a twisting ache in her side.   
<br><br>
   The grass where she trod began to rustle and grow.
<br><br>
   She rounded the Treefolk cabin and saw the Great Tree before her, stretching up unknowably high.  She gasped in shock and grief.  The crowd was forgotten. She stepped away from them, hardly noticing as they fell back in hushed expectation.
<br><br>
   "No..." she mourned, her voice not above a whisper.  The Tree was dark, bleak and withered with blight.  Tears rose in her eyes.  She reached out to it, clenched her hand in an uncertain fist, and then spread it gently on the peeling bark.  
<br><br>
   A wind sighed softly through the shriveled leaves.  A fine mist of rain began to fall.  Aklar bent her head in sorrow.
<br><br>
   It began around her hand.  A small, barely perceptible glimmer surrounded her fingers, went out, and then flared to brilliant life.  The light spread in ripples, coruscating across the trunk, ringing the branches, flowing through every leaf.  The bark healed, sealed together, the leaves spread and rustled.  Inside the darkened hollow, the pulsing rhythm of the sap began to dance.
<br><br>
   Aklar looked up, tears making tracks through the dirt and soot.  She heard the joyous shouts of her fellow Druids and Rangers, the awed comments.  She turned and found Freygar at her side, staring in wonder at the Tree.  
<br><br>
   "So this is what she meant," she said.  It was hard to speak.  
<br><br>
   "What?" asked Freygar, his brow creased.
<br><br>
   "The Goddess.  She said she'd be with me."  She was finding it difficult to breathe.  "What do I do now?" she whispered.  The celebration went on around her, as her shoulders bowed, the heavy weight of knowledge pulling at her. Freygar stood close, unable to comfort her, unable to understand.  She was alone.  Cast out as effectively as if the entire Council had stood in Conclave and decreed it so.  Te'Anara's eyes met hers for an instant.  
<br><br>
   Aklar turned, and blindly pushed through the crowd.  People clutched at her, and she beat at the hands frantically, sobbing and panicky with the need to get away. The Head Druid had known, known all along.  She had sent her away, knowing what would happen...  She was suffocating.  Faces whirled around her, mouths open.  
<br><br>
   "Avatar!"
<br><br>
   Then Freygar was there, scooping her up, clearing a path.  She hid her face in Freygar's broad chest, clutched at his chainmail shirt, trying to ignore the shouting, the chanting of her name.
<br><br>
   "Get me away," she moaned through gritted teeth.
<br><br>
   He bulled his way through the crowd, and slipped into the tunnel.  
<br><br>
   "Freygar!"
<br><br>
    Freygar turned.  It was Bayle, Gahlith at his side.  
<br><br>
   "Where are you going?"  he asked.  "Surely the Avatar will want to stay here, in Surefall, where she belongs?"  His eyes held a definite message.  
<br><br>
   "She wants...."  Freygar trailed off as Te'Anara stepped out from behind Bayle.  Aklar lifted her head.  The two women's eyes met.  For a long moment there was silence save for the distant shouts of celebration.
<br><br>
   "Let them go."  Te'Anara turned away, and began the slow walk back.
<br><br>
   "Te'Anara," said Gahlith.  "We discussed..."
<br><br>
   "Let them go."  She never looked back.
<br><br>
<hr color="brown">
<p style="text-align: justify">
   The air was cool with the promise of morning in the Hills outside Surefall.  Freygar went south along the face of the mountains, heading for the pass into the Karanas.  Aklar was unresponsive and silent in his arms.  The remnants of the night's battle paid them no heed, except for one.
<br><br>
   "Freygar!"  He turned to see Gera hurrying after him..  A bruise marred one cheek, but she was otherwise unhurt.  "Where are you going?"  She glanced at Aklar, slumped and near unconscious.  "Is your friend all right?"  She reached out a hand.   Freygar stepped away.
<br><br>
   "She's fine.  We're leaving."  He resumed his course southward.
<br><br>
   "But why?  Where are you going?  You're a hero now, you know.  They're going to give you a medal or something."  She paused, waiting for a response.  Aklar moaned softly.  "She is not all right.  Let me see," she reached insistently for Aklar's forehead.
<br><br>
   "No!"  He wrenched away from her.  "She nearly died today.  I nearly died today.  An old and much beloved friend of mine <em>did</em> die today.  She is all I have left and I am going to do what she wants me to, which is take her away from here."  He strode south rapidly, face twisted with pain.  Gera fell behind and did not call after him.  Freygar didn't care.  Whatever there was, whatever there could have been for him in Qeynos, it was dead now.  
<br><br>
<hr color="brown">
<p style="text-align: justify">
   Aklar opened her eyes on a brilliant morning in East Karana.  She lay in a small tent, the flaps open to let in the sun.  A warm breeze caressed her face.  For a minute she lay very still, looking at the fabric above her.  She had the feeling that if she moved, the world would fall on her.  There were things that she was sure she didn't want to remember.
<br><br>
   "Aklar?"  Her name triggered them, and the events of the past two days crashed into her memory.  She curled into a ball in her blanket, clutched at her head.  She slowly became aware of arms around her, a voice calling her name.
<br><br>
   "Freygar?"  She unwound cautiously from her knot, looked up and saw his familiar face, worried and weary.  "I..." she trailed off.
<br><br>
   "I know."  He let go as she sat up, tugged at the blanket.  "You've been asleep for a day.  I was beginning to worry."  He tried a smile.
<br><br>
   "He's dead, isn't he?  I didn't dream that part."
<br><br>
   "Yes.  Anthiel is dead."  He turned away and busied himself at the fire.
<br><br>
   Aklar accepted the bowl he handed her silently, and stared at it for a full minute.  She raised her eyes to meet Freygar's.  His bowl was similarly untouched.
<br><br>
   "What do we do now?"  
<br><br>
   "Mourn.  Go on living."   He deliberately took a mouthful of stew.
<br><br>
   "I don't know if I can."  She said it like the simple fact it was.  "She's there, you know.  I can feel her, waiting.  All I have to do is reach out..." She let her eyes drift shut, felt that glowing radiance deep within her.  There was no wall, no barrier.  The Goddess waited inside of her.  Panting, she forced her eyes open.
<br><br>
   "What does she want you to do?"  asked Freygar softly.
