<b>Part Two - conclusion</b>


<br><br>

"Dranconiel? Lusirita? Nefetari?" Falundir called, panic slowly entering her voice. "Dranconiel! If you can hear me, respond!" The entrance to Crushbone seemed like a chasm opening before her as Falundir realized what she had to do. Slowly, cautiously, Falundir edged into the cave, her eyes scanning the blackness ahead for any movement as she did so. Suddenly, she stumbled on something. Looking down, she saw Dranconiel's unconscious form. Suppressing a tide a panic which was rising swiftly within her, Falundir turned, her intention to get help from Felwithe. She did not have time to shout as the blunt club bashed into her face, and she fell to the floor, dead to the world.
<br><br>
Falundir slowly awoke, her final moments of ether filled with terrible dreams. "Mother, I don't... oh" she said, when she opened her eyes. She was lying face up on a hard stone floor, her hands tied by cords that bit into her skin as painfully as if they had been made of wire. Looking around, she saw Dranconiel, Lusirita and Nefetari close by. They were also examining themselves. <em>Oh no</em>, Falundir thought, <em>we must be somewhere in Crushbone. The orcs have taken us captive</em>!  The sound of a tin tankard hitting the floor brought Falundir out of her musings. Two very drunken orcs were laughing and filling their mugs from a large barrel full of a foul smelling liquid. Guards, Falundir realized, noting the halberds at their sides. Just then, something made the pair of blackskins abruptly stop and start shaking nervously. A large, fat, putrid orc entered the chamber. "Zhanherak, " Dranconiel spat.
<br><br>
The large orc laughed, sending his hideous layers of flab wobbling. "Well, look what we have here. Three little elves and..." he trailed off. "Long time no see, Barbarian. Miss your friends, do you?" said Zhanherak, smiling viscously.
<br><br>
"Oh, I bet you enjoyed giving the order to have them killed, Zhanherak!" snarled Dranconiel, and he began pulling at the cords that bound him to a metal stake in a sudden burst of rage. 
<br><br>
Turning to Falundir, Lusirita and Nefetari, Zhanherak said, "You'll be pleased to know that my army is heading for Felwithe right now, little elves. Just hope that your parents have a quick death in their sleep, unlike the guards, from which I intend to extract certain information... slowly, painfully if necessary..." An army heading for Felwithe? Falundir was in despair. There must be a way to get there in time, to warn the guards. For surely, they could not withstand a surprise attack. She doubted if they could survive <em>any</em> attack, but there was nothing she could do about that. There had to be a way out... "Of course, now that you know my plans, I can't let any of you live, except perhaps... her!" he raised a fat, greasy finger and pointed at Nefetari. "I'm sure this little elf will give my men no end of... pleasure." With an evil grin, Zhanherak cut the bonds that tied Nefetari to the metal stake, and dragged her out of the room. As he left, the orc lord gestured to one of the guards: "Boggorok, you can have them all. Grishnob, come with me." 
<br><br>
Once Zhanherak and Grishnob had gone, the final orc, Boggorok, approached Falundir, and began to sing some sort of orc ditty. "I'm gonna cut some elven flesh, elven flesh, elven flesh, I'm gonna cut some elven flesh, some elven flesh today." As he drew his sword (and began the second verse), Falundir glanced worriedly at Dranconiel. He was thinking hard, his black eyes flashing as he worked out a plan as fast as he could. And fast it would have to be, for Boggorok was now sharpening his sword on the metal stake. "Now I'm ready to kill something. Maybe then Zhanherak will promote me!" he cheerily said. "You first, Ms. Elven Lady!" He looked down at Falundir, and raised his sword.
<br><br>
"Wait!" called Dranconiel, "wouldn't Zhanherak favor you more if you had my head? I'm sure a great barbarian warrior is a much more valuable prize than some kid elf!" Falundir's nose turned up. Her? A 'kid elf'? Still, she was sure Dranconiel had something in mind, so she kept her mouth shut. 
<br><br>
Boggorok thought about this for several seconds. "OK Mr. Barbarian. I guess you're right." He ambled over to Dranconiel, and brought his sword down hard and fast. At the last moment, Dranconiel turned on his side, and Boggorok gasped at the realization of what was to come, as his sword sliced the cords tying Dranconiel to the stake. In one smooth motion, the barbarian rolled over, came up and threw a dagger from his boot with unerring accuracy into the orc's heart. Boggorok fell to the ground, dead. 
<br><br>
Dranconiel swiftly untied Falundir and Lusirita, and they raced out of the chamber and down the corridor. "Slow down!" called Falundir.  "We're going to wake Veeshan with this racket!" They cautiously edged along, listening carefully for guards at each corner. But there were none. Crushbone was deserted, and Falundir had a terrible suspicion that she knew why. They must all be taking part in the assault on Felwithe! Suddenly, they rounded a corner and heard shouting coming from behind a locked door. "Not locked for long!" said Dranconiel, and threw himself on the door several times until it gave in. Inside, they found Talamon, tied up but otherwise all right. Undoing his bonds, he and Falundir exchanged greetings. 
<br><br>
"Look, I don't mean to spoil the fun, but we'd better get going," Dranconiel cut in.
<br><br>
"What's the rush?" inquired Talamon, and Falundir explained about the army which was rapidly approaching Felwithe. Talamon's gray eyes darkened with worry, and he, Falundir, Dranconiel and Lusirita resumed their journey, now doubling their speed. 
<br><br>
Talamon's anguish was even greater than Falundir's: his father worked as a guard. Falundir flinched as she remembered the horrified expression on his face as she paraphrased Zhanherak on what he was going to do to the guards. It took them about half an hour to make their way to the top level, and then out into the forest. Dranconiel muttered that it would have taken half the time if it hadn't been for Lusirita. Falundir secretly agreed. She had constantly needed to rest, to take stones from her shoe, or to do something else equally trivial when they were racing to warn the Felwithe guards. "C'mon, we can still make it if we run!" said Falundir, although she wasn't sure if she was saying it to reassure herself or the others. Dranconiel's face was hard, and she couldn't judge what he was thinking. When he turned to look at her again, Falundir thought she detected something like pity in his eyes. Why pity her? Falundir wondered. Then it hit her: <em>he knows</em>. He already knew that they couldn't reach Felwithe in time. But surely he could be wrong, she thought desperately. Surely even experienced fighters make mistakes... 
<br><br>
Fighting the fear, panic, and utter hopelessness that now engulfed her, Falundir said "Didn't you hear me? Come on!" And she ran as fast as she could into the forest. Everything became an indistinct blur as Falundir accelerated forwards, pushing her body to go faster than ever before. She caught fleeting glimpses of Dranconiel, Talamon and Lusirita behind her, and several wild dogs appeared every now and then, bats, wasps, and then the ruins which she knew from maps learnt in geography classes meant that she was near Felwithe. Even at a distance of over a mile, she could see the smoke, rising from above the trees. Then she was there, coming over the brow of the hill that lay directly in front of the Felwithe gate. Falundir gasped. Guards and warriors of all descriptions were engaged in battle everywhere in front of her. Many lay dead, both elven and orcish, but it was clear that the elves couldn't last much longer. Many were breaking and fleeing into the woods, only to be caught by more orcs and slaughtered. But above and beyond all that, behind the scenes of struggle and death, Falundir saw a sight that made her heart stop. Felwithe was burning to the ground.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
Falundir stood, rooted to the spot by the horror that now engulfed her. Felwithe was her home, it always had been. She remembered when she was young and her parents had told her comforting bedtime stories about how Felwithe would always stand, while other kingdoms were born, prospered, declined, and then withered away. And now the haven that had always given her shelter was soon to be no more. "No!" she screamed, and drawing her small knife, she ran towards the fierce melee that was going on below her. 
<br><br>
"Falundir, wait!" called Dranconiel, who had just come out of the thicket. 
<br><br>
"No!" she shouted, "I'm going down there, and I'm going to stop those orcs..." 
<br><br>
"I wasn't going to stop you," Dranconiel shouted back, "but you won't survive long without this!" and he threw her a long sword, produced from his belt. Falundir didn't really know what to say. She glanced up at him, gratitude on her face. Then she turned and ran into the fray. Dranconiel nodded. Making sure she was gone, he withdrew his own sword. "It's time to avenge Windblade," he said, and he ran straight toward the large Palanquin on which Zhanherak was surveying the battlefield. 
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Talamon and Lusirita were standing on top of the hill. "Come on, we have to help Falundir!" urged Talamon, but Lusirita just stood there shaking with fear. With one last glance at her, Talamon brandished his small dagger and ran towards Falundir.
<br><br>
At that moment, Falundir was backed up against a wall, fending off three orcs with the sword Dranconiel had given her. It was very heavy, and she was already tired. She parried one orc's blade, but another found its mark. Falundir stumbled, and swiped, knocking one of the orcs backwards. Just as the third orc was about to strike, Talamon hit it hard from behind and it fell to the ground.
<br><br>
Dranconiel was cutting his way through orcs in a frenzy, crushing one's skull here, slashing three at a time there, and soon he was approaching the Palanquin. He came up behind it, and raised his sword. "Don't do anything so silly, now, Mr. Barbarian." Zhanherak's tone was lethal. The odious orc slowly turned in his seat. "Just because I have acquired a few pounds does not mean I have forgotten how to use a sword." He slowly got down from the Palanquin and drew his sword. "Meet Elfbane, Mr. Barbarian," he said.
<br><br>
"The name's Dranconiel." Zhanherak smiled. Suddenly, he swiped with his sword. Dranconiel parried. Their swords met in mid-air.
<br><br>
Lusirita looked on anxiously at the battle raging below. Suddenly, she noticed an orc heading straight for her, swiftly gaining ground. "Please don't hurt me!" she screamed. The orc grinned, and brought its sword down heavily on her head. For several seconds, Lusirita was in agony, her only solace being that it would soon all be over...
<br><br>
Falundir and Talamon scanned the battlefield for signs of anyone who might need help. "Talamon!" The cry came from the battlements of the walls above, where Talamon's father was losing against several orcs. They were slowly pushing him towards the edge, and soon he would have to back off the wall. 
<br><br>
"Quickly! We've got to save him!" yelled Talamon, and ran to the steps up to the top of the wall, with Falundir in hot pursuit. Talamon took the left orc, Falundir the right, and Talamon's father took the center one. Now without the advantage, the orcs were nervous. Talamon dispatched his with several well-timed blows, as did his father. However, Falundir was having serious problems. The new sword, although deadly, was very hard to handle. The orc knocked it out of her hand, then pushed her forward onto the very edge of the wall. Time stood still as the orc leapt. Remembering a childhood game she used to play, Falundir lifted her legs, prayed that she would succeed, and pushed the orc past her, over the battlements, and onto the ground, eighteen feet below. It wailed in terror, but was silenced as it hit the ground, its body broken. 
<br><br>
"If we can just hold them off a bit longer..." said Talamon's father, "a scout sent word to Kelethin. Let's just hope the cavalry gets here on time!"
<br><br>
Another swing. Again the swords clashed, Windblade against Elfbane, man against orc. They moved through the trees, each attempting to get the advantage on the other, neither succeeding. Again, unsuccessful as they parried each other's blows. Swinging low, Dranconiel almost caught Zhanherak, but had to swiftly stab upwards to block the piercing blow heading for his chest. Swing. Clash. Parry, Stab, Swing, Clash. A hard stab from the orc caught the man off balance, forcing him to leap backwards, over the axis of a second swing. Landing, Dranconiel stabbed fowards... and had his sword forced from his hand by a cunning side-on leap by Zhanherak. Quickly rolling under what the orc had thought was the killing blow, the man reached for his sword... 
<br><br>
"Stop right there, Barbarian!" said Zhanherak, his sword tipping the back of Dranconiel's neck. They were silent for several seconds. "Die, Barbarian!" yelled the orc, and pushed his sword forwards. In the same instant, Dranconiel kicked backwards, gaining the satisfaction of a cry of pain from Zhanherak, as the orc keeled over. Can't beat a good old kick in the nuts, thought the Barbarian. It had worked many times in taverns before. Then he felt the pain at the back of his neck. Before going down, the orc had obviously pricked him. There was blood coming from the wound. He sat down, and held his hand against it to stop the bleeding. But there was more and more blood. Dranconiel's pupils dilated, and he fainted.
<br><br>
With the apparent death of their leader, the remaining orcs were beginning to break and run. One orc ran screaming from combat, got to the top of the hill, and was met by the oncoming wood elf army. Once this backup arrived, the orc surrender came quickly, as they could not withstand the deadly rain of arrows that they now faced. Many orcs died, and the few who were lucky enough to escape fled back to Crushbone, only shouting insults once they were sure they were safely out of hearing range. 
<br><br>
Although the orcs had lost, Falundir discovered, they had dealt terrible damage to Felwithe. Mostly in ruins, only small stacks of bricks stood where once proud walls had been. Most of the population had been evacuated from the residential areas, and  five civilians (including Lusirita, whose body was found the next day) had died. There were severe military losses, including guards Jassonog and Legver. A commemoration service was held the following week. Dranconiel had been found unconscious, but with the finest clerical help (on Falundir's insistence) had been administered, and he would recover with no more than a scar on his neck. One thing was clear, though: Felwithe would never be the same again.
