Once the others started to stir, there would be no hope for any surprising their attackers.  Galm had to make use of this small advantage while he could.  He decided that his best chance would be to let them ambush him, but in a place where only one or two of them would be, and as far away from the rest of these cold-blooded creatures as possible.  If he was certain that they spoke the same common language that he did, he would simply curse his tiny bladder and tromp of into the woods.  That trick had worked for him twice before, allowing him to isolate his enemies.  But he had no idea what these things were, and in any case it was very unlikely that they spoke his language.  So he would have to pantomime.  He prayed to Brell that they were at least vaguely humanoid and understood the needs of waste elimination.  If they were undead his ruse would be more than worthless, it might be suicide.
<br><br>
Galm stood and stretched, loudly yawning.  He managed to swivel his head about in the process and noted that the ambushers had ceased their advance about twenty yards from their camp, just outside of the useful area of the firelight.  He also noticed that there were two of them behind him.  He guessed that he might be able to wander out between the two, as they were spaced about twenty yards apart.  If this was a standard spacing for all of them, and it seemed that it was, then he guessed that there might be eight to ten enemies.  That would be about half of the size of their own group.  Maybe their pause meant that the skulkers had changed their mind and were preparing to leave with the odds against them.
<br><br>
Galm couldn't take that chance.
<br><br>
Using an exaggerated motion, Galm scratched himself and then squirmed a bit, as if he were holding back the need to urinate.  He hoped his acting would be sufficient, but he needed to add the final touch.  He walked away into the woods, making sure to stumble, and left his axe leaning against a tree.  He hoped it would make the enemy more relaxed.  He hoped he wouldn't regret leaving the axe behind.
<br><br>
As he drew even with the two lurkers he deliberately stumbled and braced himself on a tree.  In the clutter of the forest he had a hard time making out the enemy.  But he could now see that they were no taller than a barbarian, and about as broadly built.  He moved on again quickly, so that they wouldn't take advantage of his pause to attack him.  He wanted to be a bit further from their allies when he stopped.  He moved another ten yards into the forest and stopped.  He stood facing away from his enemies and listened carefully.  His ears were not nearly as good as his eyes.  Immediately he started to worry that his plan was foolish, and he changed it.  He turned and began walking directly toward where he had last seen one of the shadows.  It seemed best to take on one at a time, and face his foes.
<br><br>
Three steps into his new plan and he was nearly blinded by the sudden appearance of a heat source not five feet ahead.  Groaning, Galm ducked and shuffled to his left, pulling a pair of long bladed knives from his boots.  He was equally comfortable with them as with the axe, and perhaps they would cause him less trouble in the thick forest.  But only a second after he drew them the enemy struck.  It moved so quickly that Galm could barely move before he was hit.  He felt a blow to his shoulder and searing pain lanced through his torso.  The creature had the strength of a Troll and the speed of an Elf!  The only thing that had allowed Galm to keep his head intact were his reflexes.  Years of training took over where thought was useless.
<br><br>
From his crouch he leapt.  Without thought he threw his shoulders into the legs of the beast, a tactic that he'd learned from a small band of drunkards that used it as a game.  He'd seen them bowl themselves into nearly anything, including huge Orcs.  Here he hoped that he could put the enemy on the ground where its speed would be less useful.  But the instant his right shoulder touched the legs of his enemy his body revolted.  The pain was so great that his own survival instincts made him cushion the blow for his own sake.  His tackle wasn't strong enough to topple his foe.  Over the sound of his own low groan he heard the beast hiss, a high pitched sound not unlike something that he had heard once while in the bowels of Ak'Anon.  If his action hadn't knocked it over, he had at least startled it.  Galm grit his teeth and forced his body into action.  He grabbed for its feet, planning to finish what he had started.  But as he reached out, the enemy jumped back.
<br><br>
What speed!  It was faster than any Elf, and where it had once been cold it burned with a heat like none that he had ever seen in a living creature.  Not as hot as an elemental, for certain, but even through his padded armor he had felt its body warmth when he contacted it.
<br><br>
He was in trouble.  With a few tricks he might be able to beat this thing.  But there was another one only a few yards away.  Two of them would finish him faster than he cared to imagine.  Galm could only hoped to kill one before they got him.
<br><br>
Galm managed to get himself to his feet before his enemy was on him again.  His only hope was to defend himself and hope that the beast would slip up and give him a shot at a fatal strike.
<br><br>
"Ye'll not get me, ya smelly beast!"  Only as he muttered did Galm finally get a good idea what it was he was fighting.  "I've eaten lizards twice yer size fer lunch!  An ya dun't even breath fire!"  He prattled on, putting no thought into his curses, just continuing a habit born of many years of combat.  All the while he was using both of his daggers to block blows from that single club.  Only by keeping himself ready for blows from either side could he hope to parry anything.  The club came at him so quickly that it was like fighting two men at once.  Two very strong men.  The daggers offered Galm very little leverage.  Each blow twisted back his wrists painfully.  And even so he only managed to slow the club down.  Each attack glanced off a dagger and struck him.  He suffered glancing blows to his head, forearms and shins.  Each blow weakened Galm.  His cursing stopped, he needed the air just to breathe now.
<br><br>
After the very first deflection his right arm could barely hold the knife, but the enemy struck on both sides.  It seemed not to notice the weakness in his defenses, and this kept Galm alive a lot longer than he had hoped.  How long he fought like this he did not know.  Time passed in a blur, either very quickly or very slowly he could not tell.  He knew that he should have passed out a while ago.  But his will to live kept him going for a moment, or an hour, he didn't know.
<br><br>
It took him a moment in his foggy state to realize that the blows were not coming as fast.  As he got weaker, he got slower.  But the attacks came slower as well.  As time passed he grew weaker, but so did the blows.  And the burning fire in front of him seemed to be dying down.  Like some parody in a play, the combat slowed to a comedy.  The tall lizard now holding his club in both clawed hands and swinging it as if it weighed as much as a giant's maul.  And Galm kneeling in the soft loam of the forest, literally resting his arms on his knees between blows, only raising his defenses at the last moment to conserve his strength.
<br><br>
Finally the lizard stopped hitting him.  Galm didn't have the strength to be glad of it.  He looked up into the lizard's eyes.  It blinked at him.  The thing didn't look tired in a sense that he understood.  It did not pant nor sweat.  But its body was no warmer than the surrounding air now.  If it hadn't been right in front of him, Galm might never have seen it.  The lizard made some noises, something that sounded a lot like a language, and blinked again.  It then turned and walked away.

"Galm!  Where in Brell's beard are you?"
<br><br>
Galm got up and began the long stagger back to camp.  By all of the yelling he figured that most of his companions were still alive.  He pulled himself into the firelight, walking in that uncomfortable way that people walk when every movement hurts.  He must have come in past his searching companions, because there was no one in camp when he arrived.  He didn't have the energy to yell.  He briefly thought about banging on something to get attention, but he never tried it.
<br><br>
It wasn't long before someone discovered him.  One of the sailors found him and began yelling in what Galm decided was Erudite.
<br><br>
The first to arrive was Omonero.  The Erudite high priest took a moment to assess his wounds, and then called upon the power of Prexus to heal him.  He had never felt the healing touch of the Ocean Lord before.  It felt chilly, as if it was reluctant to help him.  Unlike the healing he had received many, many times in the past from priests of Quellious, Tunare, Brell and others, the feeling was distinctly unpleasant.  He guessed that it felt like drowning.  It was cold and dark.  When it was over, though, he felt much better.  His wounds were healed, but he was overcome with an uncontrollable shivering.
<br><br>
Galm looked up at the Erudite High Priest, searching for some sign that what had happened was unusual.  But the man's dark features were as unfathomable as the depths of his lord's ocean.  Galm decided not to press his luck by quizzing the Erudite now.  He wasn't sure how he had survived that fight.  Where had the other lizard gone?  And what had caused the first one to tire so quickly?
<br><br>
Further thought was stifled by a bout of violent shivering.  His teeth began to rattle with the shaking of his body.  He felt a warm blanket placed over his shoulders and heard the soothing voice of the Human bard.  "We're glad to have you back.  When you stop your shaking I'd like to hear what happened to you.  It should be an interesting tale."  Hautin sat next to Galm and looked at him, waiting for the story.
<br><br>
But Galm was in no mood to talk, even if he could have done so through his chattering teeth.  Foram offered to cast a spell on him that would cure diseases, but Galm declined.  He didn't think it was a disease that made him shiver, and he was unwilling to feel the power of Prexus again so soon.  Instead he sat close to the fire and sipped hot ale while he listened to the description of events as the others had seen them.
<br><br>
They had seen nothing.  When Foram woke them they readied themselves.  But there was no rush on the camp.  After several long minutes waiting and growing more and more nervous, they had decided to move out as a group and flush the enemy out.  Glind and the Elves had caught glimpses of some very strong heat sources fleeing at good speed, but nothing else.  They then split up into pairs to try and find Galm.  It wasn't much of a tale and they wanted to hear what Galm had seen.  But that would have to wait for morning.  Galm wasn't talking to anyone that night.  It was a surprise to him that he was able to sleep at all.  But the shivers slowly faded, and as they did he managed to fall asleep.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
His sleep was not restful at all.  He dreamt of a great blue dragon, with scales the color of deep ice, catching him up in its great jaws one the shores of the Desert of Ro.  It pulled him into the depths of the oceans.  As soon as he hit the water Galm began to shiver again. In his dream he had wondered how even the dragon could hold him as he shook so violently.  But the dragon held him firm, and slowly he drowned.
<br><br>
He awoke to find himself in a vast darkness.  For a Dwarf no place is truly dark, for his vision is strong.  Only binding his eyes would prevent a Dwarf from seeing what was around him.  It is rumored that only the Tier'dal see more clearly than Dwarves.  But this darkness was complete.  And in its presence Galm shivered.  He shook so strongly that he couldn't stand.  And yet he did not fall over.  And he was so cold that he decided that the only explanation was that he was dead.
<br><br>
The darkness began to move around him.  Slowly sliding over him, moving as if it was a tangible thing.  He felt its cold embrace and had the feeling that it was looking for something.  He sensed that the darkness was… tasting him.  He wanted to scream, to call out, but his mouth would do nothing except rattle his teeth.  He wanted to flee, but the cold had numbed him completely.  For hours the darkness enfolded him, exploring him.  He felt as though he would go mad if the sensation continued any longer.  He began to desperately cling to his past as a way of keeping sane.  He played out his entire life in his own head, and still the darkness gripped him.  When he reached the present, the moment before he chose to battle the lizard, the darkness started to squeeze him.  It crushed him until his body was turned into fine moist grit.  And yet he was still able to think.  And, suddenly, he was able to smell again.  He hadn't realized it, but his sense of smell had left him the moment he hit the water.  And now it had returned, and brought with it the delightful smell of warm ale…
