Dear Oghma,
<br><br>
I read your <a href="../Issue36/paladin.htm">article on Paladins</a> and I must say that in the area of the
templar knights you are sorely mistaken.  The knights templar raided, raped,
and burned their way through much of that part of the world all in the name
of god.  They were most certainly not holy, but more of a scourge to God.
For their most agrigious sins, they are surly lost, in Hell.
<br><br>
love EQX,

While it is indeed ironic that a "holy" cause such as the Crusades gave rise to such shameful atrocities as the sack of Jerusalem in 1099, where the entire Muslim and Jewish population of 10,000 was put to the sword, and the idiocy of the Fourth Crusade, which sacked Constantinople, a Christian City, the Knights Templar were not involved in either of these events, not having been formed until 1118 and already well established in the Holy Land 1204 when Constantinople was sacked.  Part of the vows taken against contact with women were so extreme that Templar Knights were forbidden to kiss their mothers, so it is doubtful that this order was involved directly in rapine.  What is more likely is that you are referring to some of the more base acts by other Crusaders themselves which were, unfortunately, numerous.  Throughout my reading, the Templars were admired for their courage in battle and their piety, especially during the early Crusades.
<br><br>
A heavy smear campaign was conducted against the Templars because of the wealth they accumulated through gifts, annuities, and tax exemptions granted by rulers and popes. In 1307, Philip IV of France, in order to cancel his heavy debts to the Order, and appropriate their immense wealth to finance his many wars, had the Grand master of the Order, Jacques de Molay arrested.  What followed was one of the more shameful acts in the history of the Papacy, where Pope Clement was forced by Philip to excommunicate the Order and order all sovereigns to arrest the members and seize their property.  Knights were tortured for three years to extract confessions, and they were accused of heresy, idolatry, and homosexuality.  None of these charges were true, although some knights succumbed to torture and babbled about urinating on the Cross and worshipping Baphomet.  They just happened to be the charges which were easiest to make stick during the Inquisition.  In 1310 Knights came forward to defend the Order, and 54 of them were burned at the stake. (Philip didn't want them muddying the issue.)  In the end (1312), Pope Clement had to admit that there was not enough evidence to prove heresy, but it was too late.  The Templars reputation was irretrievably damaged and their wealth was transferred to the Hospitallers.  These events, too, may be your basis for your comment.
<br><br>
If you can quote your source, maybe you can shed new light on the Templars, but none of my sources had this information.  Below is a bibliography I used in writing the article:

Absor;
 <br><br>
    I, for the most part, agree with your statements about there being too many guilds that are forming without having played the game.
 <br><br>
    What I feel I must add to your commentary is that the true test of a guild is its ability to attain and achieve goals within the game.  It is all well and good to have a guild full of dwarven clerics, but what     is your PURPOSE?
 <br><br>
    A guild that has a purpose of just going out and having fun is not truly a guild.  More that of a group of like-minded individuals, banding together to survive and to get farther into the depths of a dungeon.
 <br><br>
    But, for the most part you stated this as being so...  there are too many guilds out there with no real focus, it seems.  Perhaps, once the game opens publicly, we'll get a more exact count of which guilds survive the experience of role-playing online and within a Virtual Community.
 <br><br>
    Until then, thank you for the great reading material, as presented by EverQuest Express and it's contributors and staff.
