<b>Part Twelve</b>
<br><br>
   Gwyn was at the bottom of the stone steps that led to the upper palace when his sister caught up to him, seizing his arm.  He spared her a furious glance and wrenched out of her grasp.  
<br><br>
   "He's getting away!" he shouted at her.
<br><br>
   "No, <em>we</em> are," answered Kinory, and dragged him back the way they'd come.  He dug in his heels.

	I have never truly understood the human race.  I myself am the product of the union between two half-elves.  What amazes me so is how humans can vary between the two extremes of pure goodness and blackest evil so much and so often.  While for the other races, there is a general attitude that can usually be assumed true.  With humans, that is totally impossible.  You can never be sure which way a person leans unless you really know him or her.  In a recent experience of mine, I encountered two persons who each embodied totally opposite ends of the spectrum.

<b>Part I</b>
<br><br>
The sun hurts my eyes as I sit at the hard oaken table.  The torn curtains do little to block out the sun, and the alcohol I had consumed the night before seemed to want to escape my body through my head.  The life of a treasure hunter is never done.  Many people deserve to have their property borrowed, and those whom are particularly daft, taken.  I look around the small inn, my bowl of bread and last nights stew steaming.  The barmaid strolls through the area, filling up mead and water when necessary.  Only two travelers other than myself sit on the benches this morning, more evidence of the lawlessness of the land.  The roads have become even more dangerous then ever.  Not like I care, as long as the economy is good, I'm happy.  The more money being carried around means more money for me to pilfer, which is of course the job of a treasure hunter.

Another first for me this week.  After a fairly good day in EverQuest where Absor obtained his first piece of shiny armor (he was getting tired of the dull foresty greens and browns of leather), I managed to log out unhappy.  Not overly so, because I knew this day would come, but unhappy nonetheless.  This week I added the first name to my ignore list.

What a week!

First, we begin with the banning of an entire guild, followed by a patch update which allowed players to mint their own platinum.  The excellence of the patches, which opened up the Plane of Fear and made many changes, particularly to the much-maligned warrior and rogue classes, were completely overshadowed by these events<b>...</b>

Aklar's story is truly amazing. The plot depth and development of the
characters is unbelievable, rivaling even those of professional authors.
I eagerly look forward to each installment of this story and I hope he
may write other stories when this one is at it's end.
