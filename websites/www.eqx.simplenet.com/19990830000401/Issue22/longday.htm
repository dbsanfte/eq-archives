The bright glow of the Xystran moons filled the square as Lilan slowly walked home,
smiling to herself with pride. It had been a difficult task for her parents to
convince the village elders to teach her the secrets of her people, the arcane
mysteries which had saved her kind so long ago. She couldn't believe her happiness,
