<b>Part 5</b>
<br><br>


	Darkness… pure darkness… so cold… so lonely… so strange… so… so empty…
<br><br>
	Neren's eyes searched for any hope, any light, but to no avail.  He felt numb as if detached from his body.  He thought about his life.  And as he thought, he saw.
<br><br>
	His mind churned out a powerful vision of his past, of Kelethin and its inhabitants, from the forest's view.  He watched himself.  The scenes were so vivid!  Neren cried out empathetically.
<br><br>
	…his birth…
<br><br>
	…crying as a baby…
<br><br>
	…crawling on Kelethin's wood…
<br><br>
…smiling in his sleep…
<br><br>
	…so peaceful… so peaceful…
	<br><br>
…his father…
<br><br>
	Neren wept, calling out his father's name again and again.
<br><br>
	…<em>my father</em>…
<br><br>
	His mind was full of thoughts of happiness.  He felt like a bird, soaring above the rest of his emotions.  It was wonderful to see his father again, but it was also such a pain not being able to talk to his memories.
<br><br>
	Neren slowly realized he had no body, only a soul with an imaginative mind for sight.  <em>I'm dreaming.  I must be dreaming.  I know I'm dreaming.</em>  His father appeared several times, and Neren just wanted to stay asleep forever.  His emotions flew though him as easily as his thoughts.  Each new scene brought a tang of pain, joy, frustration, sadness…  It seemed like an eternity.
<br><br>
	…Heartwood talking to Duror…
<br><br>
	…an angry bat…
<br><br>
	…the surprised face of an Orc pawn…
<br><br>
	…the lifts being dismantled…
<br><br>
	…Gilerrin's shout of triumph…
<br><br>
	…Neren himself throwing an axe…
<br><br>
	…a Troll falling…
<br><br>
	His thoughts were nearing the present.  He was more aware now, and to Neren, that was a bane; the pictures came ever faster.  His mind shouted in protest.  He couldn't handle this much!  His mind was just watching, all irrelevant thoughts cast away.  Neren produced a soundless scream.
<br><br>
	He was now aware of his condition.  <em>Wake up!  By Tunare, Neren, wake up!</em> he thought.  But soon these thoughts were banished too.
<br><br>
	Suddenly, he felt cold fear.  He tried to produce a whimper.
<br><br>
	The future!
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	"I think he's coming around," said Gilerrin.
<br><br>
	Renidyen looked down anxiously at Neren's stirring form on the plank they and the adult Elf were carrying to the ranger guildhouse.  Neren opened his eyes, then closed them and gasped out in agony.
<br><br>
	"His shoulder is well bandaged but it's still bleeding badly," said the elder Elf.  "If we don't hurry, much permanent damage could be done."
<br><br>
	<em>Permanent?  I thought you could heal anything.</em>  Gilerrin frowned.  <em>Does he mean death?</em>  He grunted as Neren opened his eyes again.  Neren's mouth opened and weak words sputtered out.  "Gilerrin, the future…"
<br><br>
	"What did he say?"
<br><br>
	"Probably just nonsense."
<br><br>
	"…Kelethin…" whispered Neren.
<br><br>
	"Go to sleep.  We'll get you healed soon enough," said Renidyen.
<br><br>
	Neren tried to protest, but coughed out blood instead.  His eyes welled up in pain.  Seconds later, he was unconscious again.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Gilerrin's mind raced.  He had found Neren, but he had let him go.  <em>Tunare!  Why did I have to leave him?</em>  Other voices in his mind said, <em>You made the choice; you saw his eyes.</em>  Grief said, <em>Still I could've saved him…if only…if…</em>  Gilerrin sighed as his thoughts flew back and forth.
<br><br>
	"Don't be so worried.  I'm sure he'll be alright," assured the older Elf.
<br><br>
	That proved to be no comfort to Gilerrin when he saw Heartwood shocked at Neren's condition in the ranger guildhouse.  The Heartwood Master was discussing something important with Maesyn Trueshot's father, the creator of the famed Trueshot Longbow.
<br><br>
	Gilerrin glanced over at Renidyen and thought he saw Renidyen's eyes water.  Meanwhile Heartwood spread his hands on Neren's body, magically assessing how badly wounded Neren was.
<br><br>
	"I'll have to take this bandage off," Heartwood muttered.
<br><br>
	Neren's eyes popped open when Heartwood began probing the wound.  He screamed.
<br><br>
	"Hold him down!"
<br><br>
	Gilerrin and the others scrambled to control Neren as Neren tried to escape Heartwood's grasp.  The fight was fairly one-sided, and Neren, void of energy, fell unconscious again.
<br><br>
	Heartwood paused, paced around Neren, hands behind him, eyeing each injury of the body.  He paused once, narrowing his eyes, than began walking again.  Gilerrin was motionless while Renidyen fidgeted out of nervousness and impatience.  He opened his mouth a couple times, but fought back the urge to shout at Heartwood.
<br><br>
	Suddenly, Heartwood's eyes narrowed again.  Concentrating, he lay his hands on Neren and blue light pulsed into Neren.  He closed his eyes and beads of sweat became visible.
<br><br>
	Gilerrin had never seen Heartwood exhibit such exhaustion from healing someone.  A thought struck him.  Was Neren special?  Was he supernatural?  He had seen Neren's fighting - the eyes, the vigor of his arms, the air filled with blurred axes, the shouts of glee, almost as if he was evil… but still fighting for good.  Gilerrin slowly shook his head.  <em>No, it can't be, I've known Neren for most of his life.  Or did I?  He was a plain youth, until his father died.  Then Llienna came and cared for him…  I do know a lot about him, but do I know all?  Was this "special" ability hidden all this time?  Was my perception that flawed?</em>  Gilerrin realized he was criticizing himself and wished to stop.  <em>It's necessary to be optimistic</em>, he reasoned.  However, the voices turned pessimistic.  <em>One death shouldn't affect me.  Only one; I have several friends.  No!</em> shouted his alter ego.  <em>You can't rationalize death with this nonsense!  He's a person.  A creation of nature, of Tunare!</em>  Gilerrin cursed himself.
<br><br>
	He snapped back to reality and saw Renidyen's eyes wander around the room.  They were frightened yet somehow determined.  They were red and tired yet full of hope.  Gilerrin immediately sympathized for Renidyen, understanding what the paladin had to go through in his dangerous journeys, then coming back to find Kelethin, his home, in danger and his friend in serious condition.
<br><br>
	Heartwood stopped and asked for a cup of ale.  The other adult Elf that had helped carry Neren handed him a glass that Heartwood drank from deeply.  Afterwards, he proceeded to lay his hands on Neren again.  Strong, blue magic flew from his hands again, yet the body of Neren would not heal.
<br><br>
	Gilerrin and Renidyen saw Heartwood beginning to breathe heavily.  <em>What's wrong?</em> Gilerrin thought.
<br><br>
	A minute later, Heartwood held his breath and stopped.  He took a sip of ale.  "The Reviver wants to keep his soul on account of safety and protection."
<br><br>
	Renidyen's eyes widened.  "The Banisher…?"
<br><br>
	"Possibly."  Heartwood sighed.  "His soul must be very torn now."
<br><br>
	"Don't say that!  You said he was supposed to be safe."
<br><br>
	"The soul itself - the soul's structure - is safe.  But not the mind; with the Reviver and Banisher battling over his soul, it is very possible his mind be altered.
<br><br>
	"But I saw him wake…" said Gilerrin.
<br><br>
	"Minutes ago.  Much can happen in that time."
<br><br>
	"Can't you heal his body?"
<br><br>
	"Ah, I was about to get to that.  Yes I can heal his body, but his mind - that issue remains in the hands of the Reviver, Banisher, and Neren himself.  If Neren returns, he will think his body is still injured.  The messages from his body will fight his mind…"
<br><br>
	Gilerrin knew that would prove to be much trouble for Neren.  A storm of messages colliding into each other…  He sighed and whispered a prayer to Tunare.
<br><br>
	The Reviver nourished Neren as the Banisher attempted to capture his powerful soul.  The Reviver could feel the Banisher's hunger.  It knew of Neren's physical condition.  It knew Neren needed comfort and guidance to the "light."  It had heard the calls of Heartwood.  It knew practically everything of mortals.
<br><br>
	Neren was safe with the Reviver's grasp and the Heartwood Master was wise not to heal his body yet.  <em>Ah yes, you will be safe</em>, it thought.
<br><br>
	<em>When the time comes, I will release</em>, it crooned soothingly to Neren.  <em>When the time comes…</em>  Neren fell "asleep" within its grasp.
<br><br>
<hr color="black"">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Heartwood was obviously very interested.  He held an aged notebook, supported by a pad of strong wood and began writing notes in it, carefully observing Neren's body.  Each little twinge made his eye jump and his hand moved quickly to scribe in the event.  His eyes were narrowed and his figure reminded Gilerrin of an Erudite, a race of very intelligent Humans that pitifully still lacked the gift of night-vision.  Heartwood hunched over his pad, and Gilerrin mentally added spectacles to complete the image.  In spite of himself, he nearly laughed.
<br><br>
	Heartwood's eyes seemed never to blink.  They were as red as Renidyen's.  Gilerrin's eyes darted toward Renidyen.  The paladin expressed stoicism, his face impassive, but inside Gilerrin could see burning emotions.  His attention returned to Heartwood.  After clearing his throat once, which should have distracted Heartwood, he realized the druid had become totally unaware of his and Renidyen's presence.
<br><br>
	The other adult left, seeing that he was no use.  Gilerrin watched him go.  Renidyen continued to stare at Neren and Heartwood.  The Elf came back though, announcing Blossom was also unconscious.  It took some time to convey the information to Heartwood; Gilerrin had to slap in the face, an action that nearly cost him his life as Heartwood immediately turned on him, thrusting out his hands, pulsing with fiery red magic.  Heartwood absentmindedly made a petty apology, but forgot about the event, his mind again preoccupied on more "important" matters.
<br><br>
	Once Heartwood knew of Blossom's strange condition, he departed to the house Blossom was recuperating at.  A few minutes passed and Heartwood returned with Blossom's levitated body.  He laid her down on a bed opposite of Neren.
<br><br>
	He moved his chair so he could watch them both, his back to Gilerrin and Renidyen.  Again, he sat down and took notes on both of the unconscious individuals.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">

	<em>Blossom…Neren…awake, my children…</em>
<br><br>
	The voice was not of the Reviver but of Tunare.  Neren recognized it.  But Blossom?  The Reviver helped him visualize Blossom.  Yes, she was also there.
<br><br>
	The Reviver, seeing that the Banisher had given up on keeping its portion of Blossom's soul and capturing Neren, let the souls go.   <em>Portion of Blossom's soul?</em>  She's whole again!   A full mind, untainted unlike those of the Teir'Dal!  Neren felt a strange sense of delight.  He realized it was coming from Blossom.
<br><br>
	Neren pinpointed Blossom and saw her.  Blossom did likewise.
<br><br>
	Then it was over.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	The quill halted.  Heartwood held his breath.  The silence was too unnatural and Gilerrin looked up from his feet.  Seconds passed but it seemed like hours, and the "noise" of silence became apparent.  Renidyen had also noticed, and his red eyes were wide and anxious.
<br><br>
	Gilerrin thought he saw something.  <em>Did Neren move?</em>  Blossom was breathing more heavily now.  Neren's eyelids moved.
<br><br>
	"He's back," whispered Heartwood.
<br><br>
	He took a deep breath, raised his hands, and began summoning powerful magic.  His hands were enveloped in blue, translucent spheres.  Streams of healing magic were traveling toward his hands in tremendous speeds.  The bolts flew ever faster - it was so bright and beautiful! - like a shining star with bundles of energy streaking into it.  Heartwood's power slowly grew, and soon even his own magic's brightness was too much for him; his eyes closed again.
<br><br>
	Gilerrin held his breath.
<br><br>
	Suddenly Heartwood pointed both of his index fingers at Neren.  Radiant, blue, magic cut through the air, striking the body.  The flash that resulted blinded Gilerrin.  A strange aftershock struck Gilerrin and the air seemed to rush pass him.  It roared in his ears, yet he could still hear Heartwood muttering incomprehensible words.
<br><br>
	<em>The future!</em>
<br><br>
	<em>What?</em>  The thought had entered Gilerrin's mind.  He shook the thought off.
<br><br>
	Within seconds, the light was gone and Heartwood collapsed in his chair, wiping his forehead.  There had been no sound in the entire event - just silence.  But the magic seemed to fill the silence and a calm melody was present.  Gilerrin remembered that roaring wind.  However, his body had no signs of bruises.  He shook his head in amazement.
<br><br>
	Blossom stirred again.  Neren's eyelids began fluttering.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">

	He flew to the surface with guidance.  This time, he knew where to go: to his body.  The Reviver had not supplied him with a new one - he was still alive!  He took the most direct route, eager to tell his friends of their fate.  As he traveled from the Reviver, his environment became more familiar.  He began to recognize the form of his body.  His soul called to the body and the body responded.  Each aspect of the physical Neren was attracted to his returning spirit.  Each aspect of life became ever clearer.  Neren felt freer, leaving the confines of the Reviver's hold.  His body seemed to greet him with the overwhelmingly sweet senses and the natural heat of his body.  He realized how cold it had been even within the Reviver.  He breathed in the delight in the ability to feel again.  To breathe!  He was breathing!  His organs seemed to tell him he was secure within his body again and Neren began to open his eyes.  The light!  It was blinding, but it gave him pleasure to actually see again.  It was totally different from his experiences with the 'Underworld' as he named it.  He felt the web of life within his body tell him he was fully healed.  Each experience seemed new, although he knew it had happened to him millions of times in is life.  To breathe, to see, to hear!  To <em>hear!</em>  His awakening ears told him of Gilerrin talking excitedly to Renidyen.  His friends!  He wanted to cry.  Another part of him questioned his emotion - the realistic part, the part that connected with his actual memories, or at least tried to connect.  Then he tried to find the true key to access his memories.  Access?  To fully rediscover every bit of his life.  His memory still seemed disconnected.  After all, a complex creation of Tunare had a huge mind, and therefore had a large area of memory; his mind was not entirely finished interconnecting the links between soul and body.  While he looked around in his mind for the growing block reserved for memory, he happened to recalled his dream.  Abruptly panic seized him.  The future!
<br><br>
	His eyes were completely open now.  He saw the ceiling with the dancing shadows of a nearby fire.  <em>This must be the ranger guildhouse</em>, he thought, remembering his past visits here, staring up dully at the ceiling for a source of entertainment.  He wanted to sleep in the comfort of the warmth, but he drove himself to try to sit up.
<br><br>
	At once, he felt lightheaded.  He lay down again.
<br><br>
	"Try to relax, your need to rest," he heard Heartwood say.
<br><br>
	His mind rebelled, wanting to describe his dream.  He opened his mouth.  Suddenly, he felt thirsty, his mouth dry as a desert.  Heartwood seemed to notice and beckoned for a glass of water.  An Elf Neren did not recognize rushed to the nearest barrel of clean water and returned with a mug.
<br><br>
	Heartwood smirked and Neren knew he had intended a glass, but he proceeded to help Neren drink.  The clean, cold liquid of life poured down his throat.  It felt so nice to drink again!  For a moment, Neren almost forgot how to swallow, but he searched his memory quickly and found the technique.  He wanted to laugh.  At first, he was concerned if he had forgotten how to laugh and smile and had to go through his still-attaching memory again, but then he realized that he was already had a half-smile pasted on his lips and that emotions were instinct.  Again, he wanted to laugh mirthfully at himself, but he only managed to keep his smile.
<br><br>
	Once done drinking, he tried to sit up and did so successfully.  Heartwood's eyes widened in concern.
<br><br>
	"We have to go," Neren said before Heartwood could tell him to lie down again.  "I had a dream."
<br><br>
	Neren's face was serious now.  He began to explain his 'future experiences' of Kelethin.
<br><br>
	The tension in the room increased and Neren's companions were breathing rapidly with frightened eyes.  Blossom, who was now awake and listening with a 'full' uncorrupted mind, began to seethe with rage.
<br><br>
	Neren was describing the victory of the Teir'Dal and their grand accomplishment: the fall of Kelethin and with it, the continent of Faydwer.
