I am not the kind of person to tell you that I am not the kind of person to tell you that I told you so, and then go ahead and say 'I told you so' anyway.  Nope (and yes, I meant for that sentence to look like that).  I will tell you that I told you so at the drop of a hat (I TOLD you to hold on to that hat!).  And now I get to do it again.  I've been as affected by the UUNet and Verant connection problems as anyone.  In fact, my first night of playing EQ since retail was last night, Thursday the 25th.  That's nine days after the release date.  I didn't even know that I was going through withdrawals until last night when I got back to Neriak and into the skin and head of Gainam, priest to Innoruuk.
<br><br>
But I did.  And I'm happy again.  Not that I'm real comfortable with the idea that getting to play a twisted priest to the god of hate makes me happy.  But I guess we all have to take what life gives us.  And despite all the trouble, it seems that life has given us the functional, wonderful and woohoo! fun of EverQuest.  So for those of you that were telling me that this was typical of the game industry, that this would probably never get fixed and that the game was released prematurely for monetary reasons: I TOLD YOU SO!  And that applies to the reviewers that have decided to attack the game without ever actually playing it, or after playing it for a few hours during this crisis (and for those that praised it under the same conditions, shame on you too).
<br><br>
And while I'm at it, I got another I told you so.  I've heard folks spreading nasty rumors about the EQ Guides.  I guess that's only natural, really.  Folks will always question authority, it's a defense mechanism.  But I've been telling you for months that the Guide system would work, and that the Guides were a bunch of dedicated and fair people.  Last night I was smiling my ugly face off.  One poor fellow, obviously new to Norrath, had lost his corpse in or near the river that runs through Nektulos.  He was asking for help.  His first question was about how long it would take the Guides to respond to his petition.  I was pleased as punch (another of those phrases that I just don't understand) to see that a few of us, including myself, respond with a comment about it not taking too long at all.  Then we gave him some suggestions about using the /corpse feature.  I used /tell to let him know that there might still be a bug that makes your corpse invisible to you, and that zoning might bring it back into view.  I had to type fast, though, because I was headed back into town to sell my loot of bug parts and other icky things.  I wished him luck.
<br><br>
In the time it took me to walk (new rule, taught to me by a friend and fellow priest to the Hateful One - always walk in town!  It makes sense, after all, and it gives you a chance to meet people and to actually see your home town... now where was I?  Let me restart that sentence, me and my stupid asides...)...
<br><br>
In the time it took me to walk from the gates of Neriak to the bank and back, with only a short delay to sell my ickies, this fellow's problem had been solved.  I zoned back into Nektulos to hear him telling the whole zone how great the guides were, and how fast his problem had been responded to and fixed.  I see similar stories on the web boards and newsgroups.  I told ya so.
<br><br>
But my new arrival, or reappearance, in Norrath means that I have to start all over again.  I've probably started twenty characters already, playing most of them up to about seventh level before letting them fall aside in favor of another.  If anyone should be tired of plodding through the first few levels of a character's life, it should be me.  And I'll admit to trying to blast my way through the first several levels with my pal Gainam.  He was sixth level, I think, when he got wiped for the release, so I was trying to get him back there again.  And besides, the folks that I wanted to hang out with were probably far ahead of me by now.
<br><br>
But then I got into a discussion with some folks, shouting my elitist clerical dogma across the forest.  I got to espouse the ideas of one T'daven H'yonith, or his sister - one can never tell who it is that really has all these ideas.  I got to discuss the dangers of interfering with a priest to the Lord of Hate when he is training his martial skills on the unfortunate fauna of the forest (silly fellow kilt my wolf!).  I got to... roleplay?  Was that it?  YES!  Sure, I'm fairly tired of kicking beetles.  I want to see the world, take Gainam and his hate all over the place.  I want to interact with some barbarians, some snooty High Elves, some...  well, everyone.
<br><br>
So look out, I'm back, and so is Norrath.
