<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello! I am a fellow bard, and I noticed that the instruments are only used to enhance spells!  Shouldn't we be able to play some non-spell songs?  This is a role playing game, I think Verant should let bards play some songs that everyone can hear, not just for party spells.  Just think of the concerts we could have, with a 4 party bard, get the percussion, the flute, and 2 strings.  I think all the bards should tell Verant to get some nonspell songs! Songs that are actually songs!

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh my goodness, I can tell you are a true bard at heart.   Would the developers and coders look deep enough into their souls, they might find enough more bardish energy to help players such as you bring music to the lands.  However, bards need to be realistic too and I don't know what it would take to put non-spell music under the fingers of players like you and me, so I am not sure if it's even doable.  Even if music for pleasure is not to happen technologically, there is always the possibility of making  your own ballads and poems and stories to share in concert with other bards.  It might seem like I'm plugging Soerbaird (and no, I'm not a member), but that guild has shown that Norrath is filled with talents to share and audiences to listen.    Also, EQ Express always welcomes new voices for consideration.  If you have a poem, story, history, artwork or whatever that might be amenable for publication in these pages, it is a way of fulfilling your bardic destiny!

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, please be patient with me as I am a new player. I am wanting to use hot keys more and more so I can have a full view of the action.  My question is this - Is there a hot key to target your nearest enemy?  Thanks for your help and may the burning flame of timpanogos be with you!
<br>
~Tylvech
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for writing in and I have a feeling there are others reading Q &A  who might have the same question.   You may already know there is a key -- F8 -- which is the default key set up to target your nearest enemy.  The computer version of the Everquest Manual, found in your Everquest Folder, also shows that you can target the nearest PC with F7 (with the other function keys being similarly assigned).  These keys can be reassigned under your Options/Keyboard box in the game to fit your personal preferences.  For instance, I have moved the enemy target designation to my "T" key as I got used to it in beta and have a natural keyboard which makes reaching up for F8 a little slower than just hitting "T".  However, if there is a way to put another keyboard key into your hotkey bank, I don't know of it.  Hope this helps and write again to tell me what in the world the burning flame of timpanogos is.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend and I are curious about how the friendly  corpse looting of no drop no trade rare items are handled in EQ.  Suppose I died and have a friend that I would trust enough to loot my corpse if I was a spectacular distance away. Could he pick up my no drop no trade items.. after granting him consent to loot my corpse?  Is it possible for him to give them back to me if its no drop on him now.. and if he can.. would that be considered a new way of bartering no drop items?  Thank you!
<br>
Sil
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;No-drop items in Norrath are indeed no-drop, no-trade.  This means that if you do die and /consent a friend to loot your corpse, the friend will not be able to give you back any no-drop items he may have looted from your corpse.  (A word of note here too:  If you have a lore item in your corpse and your friend loots it but is already in possession of the same  lore item, one of the two will disappear).   For the most part, it is not advisable to have a friend loot a no-drop item.  However,  you can use /consent and then your friend can use the /corpse button to move your corpse to a more accessible place for you to loot when you do return to the scene of your death.   This can be very helpful if you are far away and your group must leave before you can retrieve your corpse from a dangerous area.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am trying to find out exactly which prime reqs have a direct effect on your ability to hit in melee.  I always used to think that it was dexterity that influenced your chance to hit along with your skill level of course.  But now after playing several different melee types of characters I can see no discernable difference in relation to dexterity and the ability to hit (other than missile combat).  Any information would be appreciated.  I want to create a tank that actually hits its target most of the time.  Right now I'm sick of not being able to hit a white or blue mob more than one in four times at any level.  So to sum it up, I don't care about how hard I hit (within reason), I don't care about how many hitpoints I have as a tank, I actually want to HIT the target MOST of the time.
<br>
Regards, Krysan
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It took promises of exotic ales but I managed to catch up with some level 40-somethings long enough to ask about what it takes to hit well in melee.  The consensus was that dexterity is actually very important to accurate hitting.  It is good to put skill points there and to acquire +dexterity equipment.  However, your weapon skill level is crucial too.  You simply have to raise it!  A melee player who chooses to have a friend help by twinking levels, misses out on necessary skill experience.   Do make sure you fight and swing a lot!  I'd like to add a note here too.  When I finally reached the level for dual wield, I took the recommendation of a friend and used the fastest weapons around for my level so that I would get as many chances to hit as possible.  The damage wasn't great and I wouldn't want to do this in a fight where I thought I might lose because of it, but my dual weapons skills shot up remarkably.  So I think along with dexterity and lots of battles, I would recommend doing a fair number of your fights using a speedy weapon to raise your skill level.  Finally, out of curiosity, I asked the players which melee class they would play as a pure tank who would hit often and accurately --- they all chose a warrior.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;On all the sites I've visited, and all the Bakers that I've talked to, none have seemed to have found the elusive Cake recipe. I was told on EQ Answers that cakes are indeed bakeable and that the recipe books are found as loot on the Reanimated Hands in Unrest. But I recently received an email stating that the Hands only drop the normal buyable cookbooks. The idea that this recipe has gone unfound so long is highly unlikely, I think it's just that nobody wants to share their secret and they want to monopolize cakes. But that's just the paranoid conspiracy side of me. Please, what is the cake recipe?  
<br>
Hazah
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It's quite possible that no one is sharing the secret, or on the other hand, maybe no one figured out whether the secret to making a perfect cake was actually in the Hand holding the recipe book.  However, a cleric friend of mine, who is certainly not averse to the idea of having someone bake cakes in Norrath, said that he had indeed gotten a recipe book out from the grasp of the Hand.  The tome is titled "Binur's Succulents".   He didn't happen to read it as it was, of course, not a particularly spiritual title, so I can't confirm that the recipe you seek is there.  If you should find it and are able to bake a cake, let me know so I can come to tea!
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;First off I just want to say thank you for an excellent publication.  I look forward to reading it start to finish every week.  Ok, enough butt kissing *yuck*.  I was hoping you could answer what is probably a silly question, but one that none-the-less, I don't know.  How do you get on the dang boat if it has already left the dock, or if there isn't one (i.e. the islands between Antonica and Faydwer) ?  I know it is has to be something simple, so please, try not to laugh too hard at me. Thanks in advance,
<br>
Dodart Wolfheart, Ranger of Surefall Glade
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh dear, the getting-on-the-boat part is a ticklish question as the dockmaster would definitely be angry if people found a way to avoid using the docks and his source of income from "head taxes" on boats dried up.   So let's pretend I'm not really answering the question but merely imagining a "what if".   That way I can look him in the eye and smile with a little wink, knowing he couldn't possibly think I was giving away port secrets.  The "what if" that I can picture might involve you swimming alongside the boat, using a little pageup perhaps if necessary, and if, and only if you were very lucky, you might find yourself inside the boat.  Some have said that this might feel like going through a wall, but who is to say that a high wave couldn't come along and boost you up over the railings, spilling you downstairs so that, at last, you find yourself a passenger on the boat.  It's important to remember that this "what if" is imaginary and I haven't done it.  On the other hand, trying it out in Norrath might be risky -- but fun!  Note, however, that in the oceans you cannot zone by swimming.  You must be on the boat.  The boats seem to need to return to drydock now and then leaving travelers high and dry on the beach.  If this happens, a friendly petition asking that the boats be reset is a good idea.  If for some reason there is no one available to reset the boat, I have often found guides to be ready to help by using their powers to shuttle players across the sea.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What would be a better class for a ranger...a wood elf, a half elf, or a human? 
<br>
Mossimo
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh my gosh, you'd have thought I'd think twice before engaging rangers in answering this question as the discussion lasted far into the night.   If I published the conversations, the details, the nitpicking, and the highly emotional content of the opinions, it would take you approximately 3 months, 1 week and 27 days to wade through it, so here is the condensed version:  The best race for a ranger is Half-elf!  (I did NOT rig the vote!)  While wood elves do have some quickness advantages, they are weaker.  As for humans, well, if you consider that humans can't even see in the dark, why in the world would anyone choose that race if they could choose a half-elf?  
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How many zones are there between Freeport and Ak'anon? shortest distance using no magic.
<br>
Lilweyen
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this a trick question?  Sigh, I just spent the last 3 Norrathian weeks trying to find out for you and here is my itinerary which I don't think will help much.  I left East Freeport fresh and eager for sea breezes on my journey to find the gnome city of Ak'Anon and all those cute little gnomie heads to pat.  No sooner had I zoned into the Ocean of Tears when I discovered I had left my rosewater and glycerine lotion behind in the inn.  Hoping against hope the maid would have left it, I paid a gater for a quick trip back to Freeport.  Yes, it was safe and soon, at sea once again, I stood by the railing of my boat enchanted by the sound of the water and wind until siren music wafted over the waves and it seemed like a speedy exit was necessary.  Back to the mainland again.  The third sea voyage was a delight, and soon I found myself in Butcherblock positively captivated by a darkhaired dwarf who swooned at the idea of me sprouting a curly beard to meet his dwarven ideal.  Finally, when he realized that no hair was forthcoming on my chin, he escorted me to the entrance to Greater Faydark.  Now, travelling through that land is an experience to raise the hairs on anyone's skin.  If you read from Nep's Journal of Journeying, you'd soon find the words, "When lost, sit down, cry and scream for help!"  Luckily, it worked and soon I was traversing the forest and then wandering through Lesser Faydark.  However, there is no decent restaurant or deli in Lesser Faydark, so I had to go back to Kelethin (where I also had to re-use the aforementioned chapter from my journal) to fill my pack.  Finally, I made it through Lesser Faydark again and into Steamfont where I looked and looked and looked for a place to soak.  Harummph, has anyone found a useable hotspring there!  A charming baldheaded gnome wizard with a strange gleam in his eye offered to escort me through Steamfont to his beloved city and being the unusually naïve bard that I am, I accepted.  Well it turned out well enough actually although I will leave you to discover the pleasures of Ak'Anon with your own gnome guide.  Sooooo, if I counted right, my "direct" route took me through 12 zones, I think.  Of course, you may not travel in Nep style, so you might want to re-count as if you were doing the trip yourself!
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How much does charisma affect your reputation with the locals and how much does it affect Enchanters spell casting?  Is there a certain point where your charm is so high adding to it wont really help?  I notice after a certain point the merchants will stop giving me a better deal.  After a certain point does it no longer help your reputation when hunting or doing quests?  Same for helping with charm and mesmorize enchanter spells.  THANKS! An enchanter who wonders just how charming he should try to be. 
<br>
Alec
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahem, well my personal preference in enchanters is for them to pull out all the stops and max the charm.  However, I'm not here to expound on such an egocentric view.  First, the answer to the merchant issue is generally agreed upon:  Charisma and good faction will get you the best prices and the friendliest conversation but even the most generous of merchants still needs to put bread on the table, so of course he must make at least a pittance off you no matter how charming and elegant you are.  As to whether high charisma will help you with spells and hunting is apparently a matter of contentious debate.   My pontificating cleric friend stood seriously for a moment, looking out over the desert near Freeport and declared, "The world may never know!"  It's quite possible the world will never know, but it's absolutely true that I don't have a clue on this one.  My guess is that there are caps to what charisma will do if it even affects your enchanter's work, but I think you need the advice of a mage par excellence on this one.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How come when you go linkdead, you can keep getting hit and die, but you can't get healed?
<br>
Sylvos
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't listen to the mutters you overhear from the cleric --- he doesn't really know whether the coders actually only need to move 5 lines of code and add a fix, so that a linkdead player could be healed.  The way I understood it was that when you go linkdead and before you are completely knocked out of the game, your character enters a kind of limbo almost as if it were an npc being fought by other npc's.  I'm not sure that this is right but weirder things happen to players from going linkdead and dying than to the actors in all the scenes of "Halloween, The Movie" versions 1 through 23.   (Ummm, blush, I admit it -- I just made that part up!)
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Greetings, I was wondering if you knew a list of all the different languages.  I know of several and I am interested in collecting more, but I'm unaware of what all I should look for.  Any suggestions? 
<br>
Vast of Brell
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a recap of similar questions a few issues back:  There is a language specific to each race, except I believe half-elf and human who use common as their mother language.  In addition there is thieves' cant, giant (same as Combine?), gnoll, orc, faerie, froglok, goblin, lizardman, dark speak, dragon, elder dragon, elder erudite, elder tier-dal (same as kobold?), elder elvish.  Hope I have this straight and good luck in your collections.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to clarify the amount of HP that are healed with the various spells. To correct Saguren, light heal starts at 30 HP and slowly grows, heal starts at 90 and greater heal, a level 24 cleric spell heals 300 HP. After that I cant tell you as I'm only level 19 :)
<br>
Qaelan
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for writing.  Others have told me that light heal may start in the 20's to 30's, and heal may start in the 80's to 90's, but all sources agreed that the level 24 cleric heal spell did start at 300 hitpoints.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a question, but just some clarification...High Elves call themselves Koada'Dal (not Koa'Dal), and the fire beetle  eyes needed for the spell Flame Lick don't need ever need  replacing. I used mine from my first rank of spells  to my second, and never did I need another eye.  Hope this helps,
<br>
Feylind Fel'Karmac25th rank Ranger of Tunare
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks so much for the name correction and confirmation on the eternal light of fire beetle eyes!  I appreciate you taking the time to write.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer your question, the name of the two rangers who take so much offence to the slaying of innocent wolves and bears (and lets face it- what ranger or druid worth their salt WOULDN'T take offence?), is Holly Windstalker and Cros Treewind. Poacher beware! 
<br>
Famien
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the ranger whose name escapes you is Cros Treewind. I know this, because the Jaggedpine Treefolk hate Shadowknights, and they would use their track skill to find me and kill me.
<br>
Molokoi
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah thank you both for filling in the gap in my memory.  I think I was a victim of post-traumatic stress syndrome early in my barding career because the images came flooding back of Cros standing sternly over my corpse, shaking his finger at me and saying, "There, that will teach you to attack one of my wolves."   When I return to get my corpse, he wouldn't even believe me that the dang wolf bit first.  Sigh, not exactly a tolerant sort of fellow.  Anyway, thanks again.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; PLEASE tell me that this is only a one week vacation from "Rogue: A Tale of Treachery."  I am a new reader and spent half an hour reading all nineteen parts last week.  I cannot bear to leave Gwyn with that druid!  Please write more!
<br>
Kiratesl
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I can't tell you today the duration of the vacation but here's hoping that the tale will continue soon.   
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;*sniffs* Where did EXPRESSions go?  I have not seen that in such a long long time here!  I... I... *breaks into tears* I want EXPRESSions back...!  Hehe, did you buy it?  Anyway, what really did happen to EXPRESSions?  Just wondering, I missed complaining.... I mean expressing... my feelings :)  Thanks!
<br>
Aalon, 16 Monk on the Veeshan server
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our editor happened to read your question and gave me a sad but simple answer.  We stopped getting topics from our readers for Expressions and it seemed time to move on from the Expressions articles.  Be that as it may, I think you would put the proverbial smile on his face and spring in his step, if you found some area of interest or issue of the game you would like to write about and submit to his very gently editing pen.  Here's hoping!
<br><br><br>
 As usual, I enjoyed all your letters and thank you for writing.
