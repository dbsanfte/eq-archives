I just read the recent EQX article, "<a href="../Issue51/woman.htm">A Woman's Point of View</a>", by
Saskia, and I have a few comments to make on it.  Firstly, I heartily
agree with most of her analysis about RPG games from a feminine
viewpoint.  I also play for the interaction and teamwork of the game.
(Even though I *do* enjoy at times, the action oriented games like Quake
- there's a certain time of every month when almost any woman just loves
to be able to blow things up!)
<br><br>
BUT, I certainly don't take any offense at a well-turned come-on line by
friendly male players.  I know they're not in any way serious, and they
know that I know.  So it's all in fun.  I  struck up many friendships in
UO this way before the PK'ing got too much for me and I tossed my CD.
Sure, the stupid, un-thought-out ones are a pain, but it's easy enough
not to answer those.  Guys are not stupid.  They get the hint if you
don't reply.  But I've had some really sweet lines too.  After all, how
serious can you take any comment about how beautiful you are, when all
they are looking at on the screen is nothing more than an avatar - a
fictional representation that (hopefully) you can tailor to your
imagination?  After all is said and done, a pick up line is really a
compliment to your ability to create a character!
<br><br>
My advice to any male readers out there is: No one woman can claim to
speak for ALL women.  I like what I like.  Someone else may not.  So, if
you see something you like, compliment that person!!!  Who knows...maybe
it'll be me!  I won't mind.  :-)

To Absor.  I for one want to thank you for your <a href="../Issue51/edita.htm">editorial</a> in issue 51.
I have spent hours looking at these powerplayer spoilers, and your
editorial has made much sense.  I thirsted for information about EQ. Any
information.  I just found EQX, and I now am in a state of utter joy
that I can now read so many tales.  After reading your editorial I
thought about how it will be different to play the game and experience
everything, as compaired to playing it and knowing what each spell
does.  To walk up to an NPC, be offered a quest and complete it.  As a
reward I earn a new spell.  The spell will actually mean something more
by not knowing what it does before I try it.  Otherwise I would just
consider it another spell to rack up in my total.  Once again, Thank
You!
