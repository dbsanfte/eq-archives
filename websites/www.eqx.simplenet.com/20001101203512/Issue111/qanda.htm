<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;As a human necromancer who worships the Plaguebringer, I persist in my attempt to convince my acquaintances that rot, disease, and death can be friend as well as foe.  My attempt has so far been unsuccessful.  Here is my dilemma: My friends would like me to join them hunting Orcs in Crushbone.  While I have never backed off from bringing disease and death to the Deathfist Orcs near Freeport, I have so far avoided doing the same to the Crushbone Orcs.  Killing Crushbone Orcs (and their friend Ambassador D'Vinn) will bring me disfavor with the Dark Elf Warriors in Neriak.  I worry about doing so, should I in future need to travel to Neriak on professional business.  I have not yet had such need, and, as a result, I don't know how I am currently received there.  Are my fears warranted?
<br><br>

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your friendly instincts toward the Crushbone Orcs and their distinguished, if nasty, visitor, Ambassador D'Vinn, are quite correct and your fears about misinterpretation of your smiting behavior are warranted.  Although it might be tempting to go visit Crushbone and smite a few smelly orcs, it would indeed hurt your efforts to be received in Neriak someday.  However, a word of caution --  it is possible that unless you share a religious viewpoint with the guards and inhabitants of Neriak, that they will never learn to appreciate your charm and good looks, no matter your skill in necro-ology.  Therefore, when you do choose to approach that sinister city, you might want to do so very, very carefully.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the kooky fake duel names, how do you turn off notification of duel results?  I don't see the option in the chat filter menu and I have seen enough 'clever' or otherly rated duel results.  
Thanks,
<br><br>
Shumshu
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly indeed, I could find no toggle, no switch, no little box to click -- nothing in fact that would turn off the duelling results.  Although I am usually amused by the reportage and try to congratulate my friends or send condolences as appropriate, it is true that the constant barrage of duelling news can be wearing.  Thus, here and now, in this state of being, bardic though it is, I propose that if anyone from Verant happens to peruse these  pages, they consider adding a new filter for players that would allow us to choose to hear the duelling messages or not.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, I just finished reading Issue 110, and loved it. I was wondering what tips or strategies you could give me, I'm a level 3 druid and looking for something interesting to do.  Thanks and keep up the awesome work
<br><br>
Therien

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmmm well if I could sum up my suggestions in a little ditty, you'd find four words repeated there:  questing, smiting, exploring, and friends.   Even at level three, you can find intriguing quests from your guild master and from inhabitants of your home town.   Smiting can, of course, be a bit repetitious, but if you combine it with exploring the realms, there are true adventures to be had.   The real key to finding interesting things to do, however, is find friends to do them with and making the most of your  character's personality and wit while grouped.   Don't hesitate to smile and say "Hiya" to those you meet; ask questions of high-levels, exchange death stories with those you encounter close to your own level.  At level 3, remember, you lose no experience when you die.  Thus, if you are really looking for excitement, put your items in the bank for safekeeping and streak across the country experiencing the wonders of Norrath and running as fast as you can from its terrors.   There is probably no faster way to burn out on Everquest and to miss all it has to offer, than to stick in one corner day after day beating away on some boring old critters with no spark of personality.   Make sure you take time for fun and conversations that nurture your spirit of adventure.    Have a great time!
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's a question that's been bugging me for awhile and I was hoping you could shed a little light (pun intended) on the subject.  I was wondering if the time in EQ is divisible by "real world time" so I can always be able to log on when it's morning in Norrath as opposed to 7 or 8 p.m.?  For example, when it's 11p.m. my real time, will it always be a certain time in Norrath?  If so, I'd like to chart the time so I always could start during an EQ morning. Thanks and love your work. 
<br><br>
Sandywen
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me you'd have a really hard time charting the hours of Norrath but I did go and check with that stalwart Pillar of Wisdom, Tagad, who pointed out that  Norrath has its own counter that is based upon when the servers came up.  He did say that his calculations were that one day in Norrath passed every 72 minutes of our real life clock, i.e., an hour in the realms would equal about 3 minutes of rl times.   When you log on,  you really do have no idea of the server  uptime,  however, so there is really no way to tell whether it will be morning or night.  Theoretically if you knew exactly what time the server reset and knew exactly what time it was in Norrath when the game came up,  you might be able to chart the equivalent times of day.  However,  given that  the servers do reset, I think it'd be better to spend the time getting some great light sources, learning where the night meanies are in Norrath, and just logging in anytime you have a few free minutes.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ullo, I would like to know what buff stand for, I know what kind of spell, but the word "buff"? Is it for Buffer?  You create a buffer of protection?  Anyhow, thank ya old silly Elf! 
<br><br>
Vajzar
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The EQ term "buff" is primarily from the American slang "buff" which means to be very strong -- you know the kind of people going around with rippling muscles displayed to great advantage, the ones everyone points to and says, "Wow look at those buff guys"!  Thus, if you are using the term to "buff" someone, it primarily applies to spells and equipment that will make the person stronger.  In EQ, the term is often applied to protections and enhancements other than strength too.  Some people use the term "prots' from the word protection for spells that raise resistance to magic and add ac to the player.  Another old mud term, rarely used, is "vits" which came from raising the vitality of the player by adding hitpoints and stamina.  It seems to me that your explanation of "buff" as referring to a buffer of protection is also accurate if you emphasize the strengthening aspects of that buffer.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail, good bard!  It seems that recently I've run into a bit of a huntin' lull.  Fer many moons I've been huntin' gorge hounds and the like in East Karana.  Upon me hittin' me 20th season, I've been feelin' that I need a bit o' the change.  I made the journey to Mistmoore and Unrest and found neither of the foul places to be of my likin'.  Can ye or any of yer Pillars tell this dwarf of a place where he might hunt?  Despite my love of caves, I prefer open spaces as hunting grounds, and I usually enjoy hunting in small groups of 2 or 3 to huge parties that camp spawn sites.  Thanks, and may yer beard grow ever...uh...er... may yer lovely songs never cease! 
<br><br>
Ringhammer Guthwine, Dwarven Warrior of the 20th season, Brell Sirilis
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well if it's true change ye be seekin', then settle yer feet down t'my fireplace here and let's share some tales.  (Tries out her dwarvish!)  However, I get the feeling that your feet have a bit of an itch to them and you are really asking for changes of scenery.   If you haven't had a chance to at least experience the caves of Runnyeye and Najena, you might wish to arrange a spelunking tour to them to see their wonders and hopefully return to the sunlight alive.  The same might be true of Splitpaw although I think you should be very very careful there.  However, for long term smiting in the fresh air I think you might want to pack up your backpack, tuck your beard in so you don't trip on it, and set off down the road to South Karana and the Rathe Mountains.  There you will find abundant wildlife, birdwatching and giantbaiting.  Do be careful of the giants though --  they are envious of the dwarves' compact good looks and seem to want to chase them for miles if they catch sight of them.  Thanks for your courtly wishes and should my beard ever start to grow, I will contact you immediately and ask for tips on alluring chin hairstyles for females.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another solution to Jastiger(sp) on reaching the boat in Freeport.  Take secret tunnel, located in corner all the way to the left going towards Freeport.  you will hear spooky music when you get close enough to entrance.  Once in, stay to the right.  Go left, you die.  When you come out under Sailors Roost, stay down below docks, move by swimming around the corner if you feel you are still to close to the guards.  Now the hard part.  Sit down and wait for the boat. Once it zones in, swim for the spot it stops at the dock.  Come up underneath it and you can pass thru the hull to the bar deck.  You never have to deal with the guards there again this way.   Good luck and good hunting.

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly, I did not slip and slide down into the tunnels to check the accuracy of this travelogue but it sounds like it might be helpful to anyone wishing to avoid notice while  passing through the city of Freeport to the sea.  Thanks, Andrewel, for sending it in.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a question but answer to the coalition of tradefolk faction question.  I always had an apprehensive con to all merchants in Freeport until I decided to try getting the lottery ticket for the Princess Lenya quest.  After many attempts, I finally got the lottery ticket I needed.  I also noticed that all merchant in Freeport were now amiable to me!!!

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Varthanos, thank you for writing and please accept my apologies for editing out part of your letter to avoid having a spoiler answer for everyone reading the Q&A.  This is a new one to me and I appreciate hearing about it.  Thanks!
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually in response to the Freeport Merchants faction.  There are two good quests given from the Freeport Thieves Guild which  both give good FP Merchant faction.  After many adventures with this quest, my DE Wizard gets better prices in Freeport than in Neriak.  Also this quest does not affect in any way your standing with the Paladins of North Freeport.  Important note tho, do not attempt this quest with a Paladin, or any other good class. (wood elf rogue yes, wood elf druid no)  If you do you will die. :)  Safe Journeys.
<br><br>
Dreacle Soldier of Tunare of 21rst Circle Bristlebane Server
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks so much for sending in yet another possibility for resolving the merchant faction question.  Please accept my apologies for editing out the details of your letter, but I really didn't want to get the Thieves Guild any madder at me than they already are.
<br><br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What if any creatures can you kill or deeds can you do (that do not require you to hand in or get quest items from ogres, trolls and dark elves) to raise faction with the guards and merchants of these races so that you can walk in their cities as fearlessly as many adventurers of those races walk in "our" ("good" aligned) cities ? 
<br><br>
Radyek Kyrosku
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, you pretty much can't raise the factions you are referring to.  A Pillar of Wisdom did say that he believes you can go to the ogre city if you kill trolls, and vice  versa, but he knows of no way to raise Neriak faction without possibly going KOS to elves.

<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You say that there are no elf vampires, I have seen some dark elf vampires.  Not just that but albino dark elf vampires.  As you call them "Long in the Tooth."  About the albino dark elf vampires, I would also like to say that I have seen them in Mistmoore, and they live under the graveyard.
<br><br>
Leira
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Eeeeek, under the graveyard?  Remind me to turn down all invitations for late night astronomy lessons anywhere near there.  Shiver.  Thanks for letting me know about the vampires.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Howdy Nep  :)  In issue 110 you answered a player about pets and you told'em that don't give pets special/expensive/rare weapons as you cant get them back...I think there is a way...just something I've heard but I haven't tried it myself so I cant confirm it...if you disarm the pet you can get the weapon back...I think another player can disarm your pet for you...oh well...experiment with it...would be nice to know if it works  :) 
<br><br>
Nanlayan Dai'Kana - Tarew Marr
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I think you might be onto something here but I'm not sure how effective disarm would be against the pets.  What concerns me more however is that if the pet were disarmed, the weapon would fall to the ground and if it were a fairly decent weapon, it might just poof.  Seems like summoned weapons, from what I've heard, are effective, at least at lower levels and by higher levels it is easier to find reasonably good weapons for pets that you won't miss when they disappear.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in reply to Sabbin's question in issue 110, what to do with the Head of Shen. It is part of the Monk quest to get the Red Headband. Hope this helps. 
<br><br>
Laocorn of E'Ci
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks Laocorn for your in-depth answer.  I have edited it quite a bit to avoid giving a major spoiler, but I do appreciate your letter and the hints on what to do with the Head of Shen.

<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in response to a question regarding the head of Shen found in South Karana.  The head of Shen is a quest item for the Red Headband, Silent Fist Clan Monks, Qeynos.  If one were to talk to the beginning trainer ask about the red headband, this information will be verified.  Thank you.
<br><br>
YhornSilent Fist Monk, Povar
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks Yhorn for writing in.  I appreciate you taking the time to send in the information to help another player.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Just wanted to mention in the Q&A section of issue 110 you said that Druids could summon pets.  This is incorrect.  Druids can charm an animal to be a pet, for a limited amount of time.  Also, Enchanters can not only summon but also can charm a pet, but summon one, but can only have one pet at a time. Otherwise, outstanding magazine you have there!
<br><br>
Evadrepus, Wandering Druid of Quellious
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, thanks for writing.  You are correct.  It is my understanding, however, that even with the limits of the charm spell, the animals that druids charm into pets are powerful allies and quite amazing in their  abilities to help the druid conquer the enemy.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey Nep, you stated this in the issue 110 about "reverse kiting" with Bards.  "….My understanding from them is that if a level 26 or higher bard is in a wide open area with not too many mobs and cares to gamble that this is not an exploit, he or she can use the chaining song to bind a mob in place and then use the screech song to fear it, making it run away. … Since it does involve a tactic where you are basically rendering the monster unable to hit back at you, there is a question in my mind as to whether your local friendly guide or GM might have an issue with this too. "  Now I wouldn't say this is an "exploit" as this is the Bard way of soloing and using their songs. That's what those songs were made for, chaining or fearing. It is nothing different than when a necromancer casts darkness and then fear on a opponent then sends their pet to smack on its back. So your fellow bards should rest at ease that it isn't wrong to do this. Just not very effective since it's kind of hard to hit them when they run away and you have to chase.
<br><br>
Nes
<br><br>
<B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In regards to:  " My understanding from them is that if a level 26 or higher bard is in a wide open area with not too many mobs and cares to gamble that this is not an exploit, he or she can use the chaining song to bind a mob in place and then use the screech song to fear it, making it run away. While it is running, the bard can chase it, whacking away with whatever weapons are at hand, and then repeating the cycle again until the monster is dead. … Since it does involve a tactic where you are basically rendering the monster unable to hit back at you, there is a question in my mind as to whether your local friendly guide or GM might have an issue with this too."  This is no more an exploit than a good two thirds of the spells usable my enchanters, or any other snare/fear tactic.  The reason it is not an exploit?  These songs are resistible.  If they were not resistible, then it would indeed be an exploit, because the monster would have no defense against this tactic.  As it is, the monster's defense is his resistances.

Bryarr SkelbaneCleric of UnderfootBertoxxulous
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to you both for writing and I see your points.  After discussing this with a Pillar of Wisdom, I would like to point out that even though in instances like those you have both described where the songs are not exploiting a situation,  these same songs have been used for major exploits in high level zones.   It's important for all of us to be able to distinguish between proper bardly behavior and that which might bring down the wrath of the GM's and guides.  So be careful out there!

Thanks for writing and I look forward to hearing from you all soon.
