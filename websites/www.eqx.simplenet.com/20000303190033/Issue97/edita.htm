I'm back in EverQuest.  Back in full swing.  I wanted to take a second here to thank everyone that sent me an e-mail telling me that they've experienced the same sort of short-term burnout.  I think it's important that we all understand that it's the nature of things.  Even the happiest couples like to spend some time apart.
<br><br>
And I wanted to thank all of you that have been saying hello to me in game lately.  I'm a bit overwhelmed with it, really.  I've been playing Absor a lot more than usual lately, and a lot of you have been saying hi to me.  I was floored, and very pleased.  Thanks so much for all the kind things you've said about me (as unwarranted as they are) and about EQX.  I want to let you all know that I appreciate it.  As the guy that sits here and reads over the work of others, I'm not particularly deserving of any praise.  But I am glad to hear it, because it reflects how wonderful the staff and contributors on this site are.
<br><br>
I'm feeling almost like I did the day of release.  I'm happy to be playing.  I'm enjoying meeting people, if only briefly.  I'm still discovering things that I've never seen before.  New stuff is popping up all over the place.  I've actually got plans for 'things' that I want to do in game.  Plots rumble in the back of my head as I type this...
<br><br>
Dang, vacations rock!  Even if it's a vacation from a hobby.
<br><br>
And in our pen and paper game we are finally putting our extremely powerful low level characters to the test.  And we passed the first one pretty darn well.  I was shocked when a party of six characters averaging about 4th level were able to defeat 15 Sahuagin, underwater, and they ambushed us!  Things are just going well for me lately.
<br><br>
And to top it all off, they discovered an adult Wooly Mammoth, relatively intact, in Siberian ice.  How cool is it that they are talking about cloning the thing?  I hear that it realistically won't happen for three or more years, but it's too great not to think about it.
<br><br>
All I really need now is to figure out how to keep Absor from getting killed the exact instant that he gains enough experience to recover from the last death, figure out how to pick 11 of 11 football games instead of 9 of 11, and find someone with the first five issues of Tales of the Reaching Moon for sale at a fair price.
<br><br>
That's not much to ask, is it?
