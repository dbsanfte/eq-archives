"Don't think you're having all the fun, you know me; I hate everyone."<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;-Trent Reznor
<br><br>
	Following on the tail of Oghma's <a href="../Issue61/religion1.htm">article</a> on role playing and religion based on the Dark Elves, I wanted to add on some role playing tips for dark elves. I want to extend thanks to various people on the net who have written similar documents on role playing like Amoroth, the guys over at EverWorld, Ayrent the Drunken Cleric of Old, the guys here at EQX and all the rest; you know who you are.
<br><br>
	OK, so you might hate everyone. Developing a believable and fun role for your character beyond that basis can be done in small simple choices. Since this universal process has been outlined in detail by other writers, whose work I use in my own characters, I will only briefly touch on it here. Why do you kill monsters all day? Why did you heal that wounded guy? Why are you not in a laboratory somewhere? Why do you tolerate other races? What is the background and substance behind my Trade Skill? While granted no one would ever actually ask you these questions in game, by developing the answers to them you create role playing substance to use in everyday gaming. By taking a look at the in-game factions within Neriak we can come up with "the usual" answers to those questions and build a unique role.	
<br><br>
	First we look at Dark Elves as a whole. Dark Elves are the product of Hate, forged in dark union by the one known as the Father, Innoruuk. Know your enemies, and more specifically, the immediate enemies. Right away you find Halflings in Nektulos, which will provide in-character NPC opponents, as opposed to the traditional Surface Elves, which other than Guards and Merchants the only Surface Elves to kill are players. Dark Elves, by the root of their nature, hate all surface elves. It would be a very sick or cowardly outcast elf who didn't hate Surface Elves. This is not just about religion, but about the creation myth itself. Battling against other players will always be your finest points of roleplaying, and these confrontations should be well thought out as to how you would roleplay. Other than halflings and surface elves anything could be considered to be an opponent, but those seem to be the most prominent ones.
<br><br>
We can define our roles further by looking at the factions within Neriak. There are the Clerics of Innoruuk, who have made a living serving their elders and ultimately the Prince of Hate. Dark Elf clerics strike me as a highly unusual combination, as they are still primarily roles of the healer and destroyer of undead. They are a symbol of the level of intelligence the Dark Elves possess, and represent a formal civilized nature in Neriak. Most clerics would naturally fit best as someone who supported the idea of nation and unity, and would probably preach as such when they did preach. They would be at home supporting the needs of a different faction to obtain a common goal. Since they only receive their power from Innoruuk without exception, any Dark Elf Cleric that plans on living a full life would be a devote one.
	<br><br>
Next we have Shadow Knights and Necromancers. While their only choice for a God is Innoruuk in game you serve one known as the Queen of the Dead. There is some interesting background information to be learned by asking the right NPCs about the Queen. This path and the Art of Necromancy are considered to be the one true path of power, and all other magical arts are considered to be inferior. As a Necromancer or Shadow Knight your highest calling in life is to bring chaos to order and death to the Surface Elves.
<br><br>
	The practitioners of the lesser arts are known as the Shunned. These Magicians, Enchanters and Wizards are not trusted for a majority of them hold their professional ties above those of racial difference. Many of them seek the ultimate powers to be found in the multi-racial Academies of Erudites and Humans. Wizards in particular are not trusted for many of them worship Ro the God of Fire. Since the choice to follow a God other than Innoruuk would have to be a deliberate one, this invites suspicion as to their allegiance. Loyal members of the Shunned seek to bring the power of the Academies to Neriak, and earn great respect from the others loyal to Neriak through this. 
<br><br>
	The main factions of Rogues are much like rogues of any nation, being focused on monetary wealth and intimidating the competition. In addition, they have a sect of Assassins, who have been known to travel to the farthest reaches of the world on business trips. Trade related markets seem to be in the forte of this organization. The NPC Rogues of this City and all others seem to have some sort of international black market, which in Neriak controls no less than one third of the city trade and commerce. As a note, mechanically speaking this has no bearing as any Dark Elf can excel at most any trade skill, and Player Rogues have no special advantages. This is all about role-playing, mind you.
<br><br>
	Lastly we have warriors, which have the most diverse roles in society in Neriak. Some worship Rallos Zek God of War, and make invaluable pawns to the other various factions in the city. Some may be brutal mercenaries or Thugs on the same level as a Rogue. Other Warriors loyal to Innoruuk may serve as strong men to the other professions, or as spell-less Dark Knights in their own right. They also may have a role in the multi-profession Indigo Brotherhood, which I will let you find more about on your own.
<br><br>
	Taking a second look at trade skills, another point not to overlook in building your role is why you are in that trade. Since anyone can give the powergamer's answer, you should avoid explaining that your whole experience with tailoring was confined to making yourself a suit of patchwork armor, even if it was. Think about the things a merchant would have to worry about, such as competition and overhead, supply and demand, etc. Your character should be worried about these things, or at least have a reason why they aren't worried.
<br><br>
The idea behind this is to start building rationalization for your daily actions based on a common role. Once you have some of the basics you can dream up goals in game, which should be relatively obtainable goals as opposed to "killing everyone". Goals involving other players, even plotting their demise, have more substance than mechanical goals of obtaining power. Even though your character would obviously want to be the best he could be, make your goals reach beyond leveling and getting equipment when possible. 
<br><br>
The pitfall here is that the easiest role of evil, that of pure violence and material gain, doesn't present much opportunity to role play at all. It is important to avoid becoming psychopath number three hundred forty three, which can happen if you are not careful. Although this problem is universal to all innately evil roles, dark elves in particular should come across as much more intelligent and cunning than the average rabid dog. We should take extra steps to avoid this syndrome of two dimensional role playing, and not accept the "might makes right" role as a definitive guide to role playing. The easiest way I can think to put the third dimension back into your role would be to always incorporate an outside influence into your rationalization, such as that of one of the other factions than your own.
<br><br>
Try developing your role from a cooperative standpoint even if you typically play alone. This is because your character's sense of identity will have come from the faction he was raised into, and that faction's role is dictated by what can only be called politics. This means you could build your role based on the role of another faction in the city. Examples might be playing an Enchanter who aids Assassins travelling heavily guarded regions, or a militant Wizard who acts as a siege engine in large battles, or a Warrior working with the black market to provide weapons through trade skills. Learn more about the NPC organizations and seek quests based on their needs, as quests are being added all the time, and are certainly not random in nature when it comes to role-playing. Remember that you can often do quests for NPCs who are not even your same profession.
<br><br>
Once you have answered to yourself those basic questions based on your background and role in Neriak, look again at the day to day gaming environment. Ask yourself how you could fit that role into what you are currently planning, or how your plans could be altered to better fit your role. Plan your character with friends you might game with, as it takes at least two to do justice to a well thought out role. If at first it seems awkward pick one aspect of your character idea and do it well. Now go forth, and bridge the Ocean of Tears with Fair Elven bodies.
