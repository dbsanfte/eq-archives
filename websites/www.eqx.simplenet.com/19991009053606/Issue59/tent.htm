Never underestimate the power of an article's title to grab your attention.  I want to discuss the practice known as "camping" in EverQuest.
<br><br>
First the bad news: At some time during your online life in EQ you will find yourself doing it.  That's right, even folks such as me who hate the idea of sitting around waiting for something to respawn will indeed find themselves parked within sight of a spot known to be frequented by some nasty that is just the right size for me to handle.
<br><br>
"How can this be," you ask, "Norrath is a big world filled with adventure."
<br><br>
True.  But much of it is beyond your starting ability.  Let's do an analysis of my favorite character to date, a barbarian shaman named Gvarn.
<br><br>
Halas (specifically Everfrost) is a pretty busy area, rife with low-level opponents.  You can make a pretty good living out there in the snowdrifts.  But inevitably you come across a set of igloos where there are one or more folks seated.  They've staked their claim to the ice goblins that respawn there.  You can go in and stake your own claim, but you are bound to create some ill will.
<br><br>
At certain levels you need to move out to the tundra and hunt larger beasts.  So a secondary process takes place, which I've routinely referred to as "fishing" or "hunting".  Seems to go real well with camping.  With fishing, a spell caster moves within range of a target, aims, turns toward his party and prepares to run, then flings a spell at the target.  He's got a pretty good lead on it then and gets back to his party with the animal in tow.  With hunting, a warrior type walks up to the animal and taps it on the shoulder… usually with a sword, mace, or other device, and similarly runs back to his party.  People do this to keep the party together and to keep the party out of the animal traffic where they can be attacked from behind by wandering beasts.
<br><br>
Did I just give away any trade secrets?  No.  You'll see this practice first time you go into a secondary zone, beyond the valley of the newbies.  Happens absolutely everywhere!
<br><br>
I'm about to say something very unpopular: It's no better than camping, folks.  How is parking yourself on a respawn and swallowing up all the monsters that appear there any worse than taking advantage of the game A.I. and leading an animal across country to where five of your buddies stand with clubs and such.  In real life there's this thing called self-preservation.  In EQ, some animals only save themselves when near death.  None of them say, "Hey, that looks dangerous" and stay away.
<br><br>
So, back to the barbarian I mentioned.
<br><br>
I decided to see the world.  My character feels out of place in Halas, in a role-playing sense.  She takes off on a journey that finds her on the other side of the ocean, in ButcherBlock, stomping larger beasts than she was fighting at home.  I was having fun in my party of two.  Just Gvarn and her companion running around chasing down animals and wailing away… no camping, and only fishing when one of them needed to sit and heal.  Almost like one might do in real life.  Even did some raids on enemy camps, when there weren't hordes of folks seated in the orc compounds waiting for something to appear.
<br><br>
Now part of the responsibility of writing an article for a beta is coming up suggestions.  What good is complaining about something when the folks who make the game are making it to the best of their ability.  Here are some suggestions.  One of these I've seen implemented to great success, whether it was intended for this purpose or not.
<br><br>
<u>Griffins, Heroes and Other Big Nasties</u>
<br><br>
When you are a medium level character there is nothing more disheartening than to see the words "A griffin claws you for 72 points of damage".  Many of the zones have some creature that is to be feared, and whose wandering will make anyone think twice about staying in the same place too long.  The minotaur hero in Ak'Anon is a classic example of something you don't want to be in the path of.
<br><br>
I love the idea that there are high level predators even in medium level zones.  It keeps folks aware that they are mortal and if their range is large enough they can break up spawn points.  And this is coming from a guy who was killed by a griffin three times in the same day with a phase 2 character.  Certainly causes one to "look to the skies!" more frequently.  The minotaur hero appears in one of the busiest areas, and that means that even though I know where it is, I still have to go there in order to get in a good day's fighting.
<br><br>
<u>The Broom</u>
<br><br>
If one can have rain occur randomly, then why not a plague?  How about a drought?  Yea!  All the people in a certain zone discover the warning that they are "out of drink" is appearing on screen.  How can that be, since I bought 10 flasks of water earlier?  I check my inventory and the water icon is different.  When I click it the water says "Contaminated water".  Loss of a needed supply might move some folks off their spawn points and to the nearest supply house.  Some areas would be more prone to this kind of thing, like dungeons.  A grungy place like befallen or unrest would be prone to contaminating germs.
<br><br>
Would also increase the value of folks in the party who can create more water for you.
<br><br>
<u>The Factionizer</u>
<br><br>
Who says an enemy has to be tough to be scary?  Let's say that Jarvis Kibblegon is a gnome who is quite sick in the head.  But he's a gnome, and therefore is pitied by his people, who feel protective when their poor sick friend is killed.  So the tiny gnome runs into combat screaming something about red pajamas and swinging a croquet mallet like it were the hammer of Thor itself.  You could kill him for interrupting you, but then you'd piss off every gnome in the region.  They wouldn't sell to you, and perhaps the guard might even attack you on sight.
<br><br>
There are already factions in the game that tip the balance.  The idea here is to put in a small creature… one that can't cause a "train" (a string of monsters chasing a fleeing character toward a zone transition) to run through the land, but one that will cause people to zone to get away from him.
<br><br>
<u>Rangers</u>
<br><br>
Let's say there were a group of folks who didn't like camping.  Perhaps their whole purpose is to wander the game and disrupt these little campsites.  They could be players who simply show up and, through role-playing, ask the characters to leave the orc or gnoll site.  They could go so far as to challenge them to duels, or just fight straight out.  This would be vigilantism, and it is not the official position of EQX or RedEye studios that the law be taken into your own hands.  But such is the way of role-playing that occasionally something you do is at odds with something that others believe.
<br><br>
<u>Random Respawning</u>
<br><br>
I'm no programmer.  So I'll just say up front that I figure that if this were possible they would have done it already.  I'm referring to having the game generate its random monsters in new locations each time.  Or perhaps sometimes generate them in droves.  You'd be less likely to sit and wait for those two orcs if one time 6 of them spawned on top of you.
<br><br>
<u>Quests</u>
<br><br>
If it were more beneficial to folks to actually perform a quest than to just sit and kill then camping would dry up a bit.  Here's the problem as I've encountered it so far: When I talk to NPCs and find out about things that I need to get, I have not yet bee able to accomplish any but the simplest quests.  Then I'm wandering around, fight with a goblin, next thing I know I've found a tattered note or spellbook or something I can neither use outright nor figure out the associated quest.  That is, I can shout to the region "What do I do with so-and-so's spell book?"… which I personally find annoying and outside the confines of the logic of a role-playing game.  It would be nice if there were a being or beings who you could regularly ask about things you find, even if they only gave you vague clues.  "Oh sage of Kaladim, what do I do with the Words of Defiance?" - Answer "Your answer lies in the eastern section of Freeport".
<br><br>
As it stands now, you'd have a heck of a time matching up one random item (and there are MANY!  I have a whole bank account in filled with them) with an individual when you have no clues.
<br><br>
Quests have the power to break up the monotony of sitting.  And with the appropriate experience reward for success they can be more profitable.  They would certainly be more fun!
<br><br>
The intent of tossing out these ideas is not to say that one or another is right.  Personally I think they all need further development, but unless we can create a conversation regarding these things then we can't get to the real answers.  A lot of time is spent focusing on the problems of the game and less so on making suggestions… even bad ones.
