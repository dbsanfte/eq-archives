Mirodem has approached me today in my cubicle.  I was working on a translation from Elder Dragon into Erudin at the time that supposedly the Enchanters Guild thinks has possibilities.  Mirodem and I have never been close.  Though as the Director for the library he does command a certain amount of respect, I can't help but to feel that it is only his position that causes my fellow scribes to give any.  Today however, I almost could have changed that opinion.  It would seem there has been some suspicious occurrences with the Black Burrow Gnoll Clan.  Reports out of Qeynos reaching us here in Erudin say that there has been a decided change in the gnolls' reoccurring attacks.  They have more direction and uniformity to their ranks than before.  The shifts their watchers are taking now vary, where as before they were almost like clockwork.  They also seem to solidify in their numbers when under attack and stand their ground.  No longer do they dash to and fro, but instead almost appear to try to form military ranks.  Considering the intellect of the average, let alone less than average gnoll, it would seem that someone has taken a hand in guiding their strikes against the surrounding areas.  Mirodem has asked me to investigate to see if there is any true threat.  Should any true mishap befall Qeynos, Erudin would be hard pressed in finding new trade routes.  This prospect sounds intriguing.  I could not refuse the thought that perhaps I could be the next one adding a new addition to our shelves of knowledge.

The rain has not stopped since our crossing began.  The Captain assures me there is no need to worry.  Despite the storms that occur this time of year, he says that he can navigate us to Qeynos without ever coming out of the hold.  I would feel much better if he wasn't in the hold so much, let alone if he were of true Sailor stock. We should reach Qeynos in a day, the winds permit and the gale does not rage any further out of hand.  I almost miss my warm dry cubicle, but the sea is refreshing.  I was up on deck when the rain died down somewhat.  Despite myself, I threw back my hood to feel the sea spray and rain on my face as the boat cut through the swells.

I have arrived safely and I have found lodging at the Red Lion.  It really is a wonder to me how we made it at all.  I would speak to the HarborMaster at great lengths regarding this so-called Captain.  Swill is more the term.  I do not believe a day did not pass that he was below deck and getting drunk with the off watch sailors.  The ship passed so close to Erud's Crossing I felt sure we would beach, if not join a sister ship in a watery grave.  It took all my restraint not to touch the half-elf's mind just after a long night of drinking to make him never wish to see a mug of ale again.  Only the fact that there was another of my profession aboard held me back.  One can never be sure unless in the marble halls of our fine city if  you are being watched.  Tomorrow I intend to gather supplies and head into Qeynos Hills.  Something of note happened while I was on the docks.  The guards were uneasy.  I heard a passer by mention the gnolls in the surrounding hills.  Of course the guards talked bluff to the citizen claiming there was no need for concern and spat.  But, to the trained eye, I could see the fear.  The guards in Qeynos are putting up a very good front of still being as strong as ever holding the Black Burrow Gnolls from the people's throats.  I cannot help but to ask myself, do they do this to keep panic from the populace?  Or do they do it for themselves?

I have sat upon a hill near Surefall Glade most of the day.  It has been a rather precarious position.  The gnolls indeed do not seem to keep to any set schedule in their watch changing.  More over, they seem to shift their numbers.  I have not been able to discern if the scouts are coming in and strengthening the current position or if there are scouts in the watch and later leaving to survey the area.  More than once I have had to hide from their view.  Two Patrols passed so near that I was afraid they'd see the glow of my spell before it dissipated as I moved to hide on the other side of the hill.  Unfortunately, they passed so near I could almost feel the heat from one of the patroller's breath.  The stench of dead flesh twisted my stomach so, that my spell started to blur.  In my fear that followed as my own image began to reform, I almost completely lost my control.  I was barely able to clear the outside world from my mind and concentrate in time.  I do not know how they could have missed a boulder suddenly beginning to look like a woman.  Yet they did not stop.  Perhaps their eyes were trained distantly on the hills.  I tried to peer and perhaps see what might have held their attention so.  The answer escapes me completely at this time, for they were looking towards their home and not outward towards Qeynos or Surefall.  During these moments of confusion and terror, I wonder why Lloginath entered my mind?  Perhaps it's too many hours in my cubicle and not enough in the world that my mind has taken foolish fancies when given the slightest fright.

Upon returning to town I found a festival in full swing.  Karana's Tidal, celebrating the very storms I encountered in my crossing.  The main square near the gnome's ingenious clock was full of gatherers.  Silk dresses making slight rustles in passing, gentlemen laughing or whispering in their lady's ear, and children playing Rip-pool in the fountain.  There was not a space left open in the tents before my hotel for another vendor.  Sweet meats, cakes, pastries, and hot rolls were in abundance.  There were several hawkers moving among the crowd selling Sea Masks for the partygoers to fancy dress balls.  Despite the confusing things I saw today my feet would skip every now and then as the bards danced in and out of the crowd.  I wished to clear my thoughts to think, but before I could reach the door a roguish human swept me up and begun to swing me around the crowd.  It felt good to dance again, and his smile teasing the corners of his mouth showed that he knew I liked spinning in his arms.  Even with this insolence with such an assured familiar manner, I could not stop myself from enjoying the dance.  The night air was still a bit cool from the storms, the music was so lively and I could feel the slight bite of winter in the air as the world moved towards colder and darker months.  I loved being myself again for once without forethought of who was watching or how I would appear.  He leaned close once to whisper in my ear about a particular bard's outlandish style of dress and I could not stop myself from laughing.  It sounded strange to me, have I not laughed in so long?  But, my talented dance partner merely continued to whisper soothing words in my ear.  When the next ballad started I disengaged myself from him.  He made sweet promises of Elven Wine and a quiet walk, but I neither had the desire nor the inclination to consider it.  Lloginath, you haunt me.

I have once again taken up my post upon the hill.  At first I thought perhaps yesterday's observation was a mistake.  However, I am almost sure it is not.  Twice during the day I saw the same behavior.  It is as if the gnolls are not patrolling outward for intruders at all.  In fact from my observation, which would entirely dismiss except witnessing first hand, I begin to believe that they are actually preparing and watching for an arrival.  That the scouts and watch changes are really because they do not want to be caught seeming lax.  In which case, I can only guess, the patrols are there to spot intruders, but hopefully to spot an arrival that will try to take them by surprise in a test of their abilities.  What could not only want to test the gnolls' alertness, but go to the trouble as an ally to arrive unseen to further test them?  This is linked to the gnolls' sudden organization?  I cannot subscribe to that.  If that were the case then the gnolls would have used such tactics before had they the ability.  It would seem that not only is there now something of intelligence directing the gnolls, but something coming to make a pact with them as well.  If this is the case, then there is far more afoot than just the Black Burrow Gnolls Clan.  There is something else beyond them that are moving too.

I think, it was the ranger coming back.  My tongue is too large, feel like am choking.  I try to tell him to talk to Mirodem in Erudin.  It's not as it seems to them.

The people of Surefall showed me the exit of their glade when I inquired the way into the hills.  I cannot tell what has occurred except in my last entry I was not myself.  They must have caught me.  I have no recollection outside of grass under my feet.  Then blackness.  I will venture further soon.  The gnolls shift faster than before, their patrols heavier.  I have had to constantly maintain my spells to make sure I am not discovered and not been able to get to my previous outlook.  My mind whispers to me, but it's out of reach what knowledge I may have gathered those moments before becoming unconscious.  I am sure I was on to something, but it dances away each time I reach grasp the thought.  I look over my notes, yet they provided nothing.  The stars, I can see them from my position and think that this piece in the puzzle flashes just like they.  Bursting for a moment, then fading before I can fully see the brilliance.  My arm still aches from the bite that tore my flesh shoulder to elbow.  How did they find me?  How do I try again knowing that I did not even prove a challenge to them before?

I have returned to Surefall Glade.  The ranger who found me is not here, but a druid has shown me to a resting-place near the lake.  The waterfall is a distant thunder.  This place is alive; scents coming to my nose are of earth with a slight accent of some flowers I cannot name.  Despite the waterfall's roar, one can hear the trees over head rustle in the wind.  I find the peace relaxing despite missing the amenities of Erudin.  I suppose one would become use to it after time.  With no raised defense for protection, just the natural curve of the land,  I have to admit they are brave living with no true walls against their disgusting neighbors.  There is a man fishing near me.  He too has been wounded.  I gather from his dress that he is one of them.  He has a terribly mangled leg, yet his face shows total contentment as he fishes in the lake.  I do believe he is smiling every time his line comes up empty.  Truly a different people, a different view of life.

I woke this morning to find the ranger sitting near me.  He had some leaf looking packages which he handed me and told me to eat.  It would seem he to has been out into the hills this morning, all though for fare or some other purpose I am not completely sure.  He introduced himself as Selyton, inquiring what I had been doing so close to the gnolls' home.  I did not feel comfortable imparting my true mission, but said I had noticed a patrol and hoped to follow a bit to make sure they took a different path from mine.  I could not tell if he was satisfied with this answer for he merely nodded at me without a change in facial expression.  Selyton then asked if I had plans on going into the Burrow, giving warning that the gnolls were much fiercer of late.  He continued, informing me they have also erected a new flame watchtower.  Above it now sits a strange, almost statue-like creation.  The Glade believes it might be an idol to Bertoxxulous, but are unsure at this time.  No one has gotten through the patrols to check.  It was to easy, and I believe there is something here that he's holding back as well.  The opportunity of offering to help get a closer look, however, was to much to resist.  He didn't smile when I did, merely nodded his head with the same unreadable expression.  It would seem my question was of no surprise.  This fellow is very hard to judge.  Again I cannot tell if he's hiding a secret like I or he is naturally stern.  He spent the rest of the day showing me his home.  The Glade is truly beautiful in an alien way.  I was just turning to ask him what a particular plant with fern like prongs might be, when a large cub bounded of the edge of a ledge over my head and landed on him.  My spell was almost done when I realized the cub was licking his face.  He must have sensed I almost attacked, those hard brown eyes bore into my head from over the cub's shoulder.  Like I was a child about to commit the ultimate sin of stealing the temples main relic in front of the high priest.  I turned and made my way back to the lake.  It is now dark and I still have not seen him, my only company the strange man so happy fishing without a catch.  Perhaps we shall not be traveling together after all.

I cried out at a hand shaking me.  Blinking in the darkness, his hands flickered and emitted a dim glow.  Selyton had not changed his mind for he told me to ready myself.  The hour was shortly past midnight, time to go.  Instructing me to take the bare minimum of my needs, he sat back on his heels to watch my preparation.  At first it was hard to gather my thoughts, his gaze is completely unnerving.  I almost instantly reached to place my Journal in my small pack when I thought better of it.  I asked him if there was a place low to the lake so I could wash my face before we went.  That odd direct look of his seemed to last for over ten heartbeats.  In fact, I thought he had not heard me and was starting to repeat the question when he stood.  I gathered my packs and turned almost bumping into him in the darkness of the glade.  He took my hand.  The calluses around the edge of his palms scratched in their roughness, but his fingers were for the most part smooth.  He must be a fletcher, used to working with oils.  He guided me to a spot near the lake, and said he'd be back.  I shall take my guild ring to, just in case.  I realize losing this Journal could cause great harm, but so could leaving it.  It is time.

Selyton is asleep.  I think.  I can never be sure with him.  There has not been an opportunity for anything except terror since he took me from the Glade in the night.  The drums pound constantly, I do not know how the outside world cannot hear them.  The stench is in everything.  My nose, hair, I almost forget what fresh sea air smells like or something soft to rest on.  Asking Selyton if anything in here could be considered &quot;normal&quot; for the place is a wasted effort.  He merely grunts.  Though he did say he has been here before.  His thoughts on anything that might be changed enough to be noted elicit nothing but that… look.  It never stops, sometimes I feel like he sees me without ever even turning.  Sometimes I wish to yell just to hear something louder than the drums.  They beat deep below our hiding place, echoing out of the depths of the Burrow.  The night we left I felt fear, but it has been almost a nightmare since.  Selyton slipped us between the patrols.  Twice I thought we were done for, but he's a rather formidable opponent buying the time I needed to ready an attack.  Once through the lines the entrance was heavily guarded.  I used an animation to lure them away long enough for us to slip inside.  The walls had strange crude markings of a beast, perhaps, with a sort of hood-like face?  The drawing almost looks like a child's, but they are too large for a child to have made.  I guess a very unskilled hand actually bothered to create them,  perhaps a semblance of something from home?  An image to be remembered, though crude?  The formation of the tunnel shows it was designed to give defensive positions from within, leaving an attacker open with no cover.  Once inside, the fear I felt from without seemed marginal.  There is an open pool of air in the middle with water filling it far below.  Gnolls watch behind alcoves observing the main courtyard.  The gnolls themselves are dressed in camouflage gear, their dark blue fur matted with dark smears reeking of dead flesh.  Using the cover of darkness we were able to slip in to a tunnel leading down into the Burrow.  Here we met resistance.  I exhausted myself during the battle but between us, we were able to dispatch the contingent.  Selyton told me to find the place we are in now.  I do not know how he dispatched the bodies and proof of our presence.  It was terrifying creeping down that long steep ramp, the drums hollow sound echoing louder up to me.  I feared I would step right into a whole pack of the filthy creatures when I found a crevice in the wall, which we are now resting in.  Selyton took first watch allowing me rest.  I am not used to this much activity and was spent.  He woke me a few hours ago.  I have no idea how long I slept but from the feel of it, it's been a sun cycle since we left the glade.  There is hardly room to turn in here and it seems like half my limbs are being stung with needles from lacking proper circulation while the other half tries to find peace from sharp rocks wishing to pierce my flesh.  I have shifted, hopefully without waking Selyton, so a streak of light hits within enabling me to see to write.  Twice I thought us discovered.  Clawed feet stood directly in front of our hiding place.  Before I could reach out to touch Selyton he was awake and placing a hand on my shoulder for silence.  How he could possibly awake or know something was there so quickly, just as I was sure it's presence was not passing?  I could feel his breath tickling my ear, but I paid no attention to trying to gauge his state by his' rhythmic exhaling.  Instead I cleared my thoughts, reached out to the mind in front of me, and gave disinterest in what it was looking at.  We have been lucky, both times a low growl would be followed with a sniff and the thing would move on.  Selyton is stirring awake.

I think we have been in here two days now, it seems a week.  Our explorations have been hindered greatly.  Every moment I expect our hiding place to be discovered.  The courtyard above us has high pillar like rock formation in which a gnoll constantly stands watch.  From this point he can signal the others below in case of intruders.  Selyton and I have been searching, and fleeing, looking for another way down into the burrow.  Short of flinging ourselves to our deaths into the wide pit that takes up most of the courtyard's space, he has failed to locate one.  It would seem this ramp is the only way down.  This place is truly formidable.  It would be impossible for a successful attacker from above to enter its heart without alerting those within.  I shared the thought with Selyton that the Burrow is a cleverly designed military outpost.  I think it's one of the few thoughts I have had that  to which he actually gave agreement.  The ramp comes out into a large chamber at the bottom.  From here there are two bridges.  One leads across a chasm to another up raised rock platform.  These give the gnolls on watch a perfect vantage point to see anything coming in the ramp.  The other bridge is to the right.  This also is in full view of the gnolls standing on their high peek.  There simply does not exist a way into the Burrow's depths without being seen.  I can tell Selyton is troubled.  Our rations have run out, yet he seems to be able to scrounge up enough for us to get by on.  Water is the hardest thing.  I dream of being clean again, yet I cannot even wash the dirt from under my nails.  Before being clean though, I dream of silence.  The drums continue, their rhythm is faster now.  Whatever their day and night action represents is quickly approaching it's purpose.  I must leave Selyton behind now.  I think I can get in deeper alone, I know his skills now cannot help me.  I have suggested as much to him, he has instantly rejected it reminding me of how I arrived in Surefall.  Arguing that I was taken by surprised by ambush does no good.  He states we are here together and we shall leave together.  I must be fully prepared.  There will be little chances to rest myself once past this last obstacle, while maintaining the full calm to influence the gnolls around me.  I shall begin with him, I believe while he rests I can keep him in that state long enough to get past the guards at the bottom of the ramp.  While the gnolls were most active we have had to remain still for long periods of time in this cramped hole.  I started to whisper to him my thoughts of his home.  He placed a hand over my lips least I be heard.  I had to get the drums out of my mind, to do something other than hear their constant beating drilling into my brain.  I touched him.  His hand tightened around my mouth as my mind reached out to his.  Then I tried to project the feelings, smells and atmosphere of the Glade I had experienced into his head.  I wish there had been light in here.  I believe he may have smiled.  His hand slid from my mouth and I could feel him relax in the darkness.  I think this pastime has kept me from madness.  When we later returned from a brief excursion, he took my finger and placed it to his temple.  I could feel the dirt on my hands flake off against his rough calluses.  I could not help but think of water and home.  I lost myself to my own longings of the sea and our marble halls.  He half whispered half gasped something but I could not quite make it out.  I think he may have said beautiful.  He has a strong will and might notice instantly me touching him.  But, with the cover of images of the Glade, I should be able to make my way to the ramp's bottom.  Once past the guards there, it would be suicide for him to even attempt reaching me.  My hands feel like ice, this time I know, there will be no ranger bringing me water if I place a foot wrong.

Disaster would be generous to describe what befell me within the Burrow.  I was indeed able to slip past the guards and across the lower bridge.  It was a simple matter of making them think they wished to look elsewhere.  Following over the bridge I noted a deep pool of water and a door on the other side, behind me was a path that followed close to the watchers on the rise.  There were too many for me to try to control all at once, so I headed for the door.  Once inside it, the pounding of the drums seemed overwhelming.  I almost wished for the crevice to curl up in.  I picked my way down the hall desperately trying to hear anything approaching and knowing it was in vain.  Then, I came to another door and sealed my fate for the next hours?  Days?  I changed my image and slowly opened it.  Before me lay a pit with a wide ridge around either side.  In it were large rusty spikes, about the size of a barbarian in height and width sticking up towards the caverns ceiling.  Bodies had been shoved so far down on the spikes that they were almost split in half.  Gnolls were kneeling in the middle of this pit making strange howling noses and swaying back and forth.  Some of them were so enthralled in their motions that they had torn their camouflage pants and were bleeding at the knees.  They were facing a gaping hole in the cavern's wall that had a slight incline up to the mouth.  On either side, sitting on the pit's edge, were two large strange looking drums.  From the drum's top portion's shape and size, I believe the heads were made out of human skins.  In middle of this cavern's maw stood three figures.  Two of the figures were human.  One was in silver plate mail, his bare head blond.  I could not see his face as his back was to me.  The other human was that faced towards me wore a brown robe with the cowl pulled up around their face.  Flickering torchlight did nothing to help me seen inside to glimpse any facial features.  With them stood, even now I find it hard to believe, a gnoll.  This gnoll, however, was unlike any I have ever seen or heard tell of.  The fur that could be seen from under its richly designed robe was almost pure white.  In one hand it held a strange staff that seemed to have glowing carvings etched down it's length.  Every so often it would turn to bark at the gnolls in the pit, and their swaying would increase howls frenzied.  All my training, all my years of experience in control came to naught.  In shock, I lost the power of my spell.  I still remembering the hood barely moving to center me in view, the blond human turning.  All I could see was the smirk of his lips.  My eyes frozen at the cruelty displayed upon them and the amusement.  I must have stood for a couple of breaths unable to turn my eyes away from those lips.  Then the shrieks of the worshippers reached my ears as they started pouring out of the pit towards me.  They caught me easily.  A blow to my back knocked me senseless.  I drifted in and out from knowing my surroundings.  I remember at times feeling my flesh burning and wondering where the shrieks around me came from.  I could hardly move my body from blows that had or were raining down upon it like the storm I traveled through from home.  But mostly I remember those lips.  While struggling to breath those lips were constantly before my eyes.  Any time I felt something sucking the air and life out of me, I knew the lips were there even if my eyes were too swollen shut to look.  Half of me strained for breath every moment.  The next inhale, though it tasted like a rotting corpse, would be worth feeling my body sing over its beauty and cause me to weep from it's touch in my lungs.  The other half screamed to me that I could be free without air and I was wasting myself on frivolous fancies for nothing.  I remember, I finally could fight no longer for the dancing wisp I now called Breath.  The blackness began to engulf me.  My mind was telling me it was time to go home and that other half of me waging war.  It was crying out from just one, this time I would catch Breath forever.  &quot;It's over now, time to go home.&quot;  I think I felt something stroking the bruises on my face, pushing back my hair from the dried cuts.  I believe it was my spirit.  Assurances of no need to fight any longer.  It spoke to me of safety now, that I would soon be well.  I could feel something moist drop on my face.  I was horrified that I had caused my spirit to cry so for me, to cry over my vanity in chasing Breath.  I tried to make assurances I was here now and apologies, but my mouth couldn't work.  My jaw must have been broken for crushing fire swept through followed by admonishment by spirit to do nothing.  Just given in.  An intense warm feeling began to creep through me, the pain in my jaw easing.  So much was the reward of surrender, it felt as if swelling was receding.  What you might have once called eyes, returning to a natural state.  I lost myself in it while racing to the deep blackness, going to rest.  No more will I dance to Breath's tune and false promises.  I am free of it and my soul was responding in happiness by taking the pain from me.  The campfire is warm but I feel chilled to my stomach remembering these things.  I hope never again to feel that icy blackness, the world spinning above and without air to breathe.  How terribly I under-estimated Selyton.  Cros has taken him away from camp.  From the look on Cros' face, I think I could begin seeing Selyton's natural expression now as almost warm.

Cros and Selyton were away from the camp until the following nightfall.  I do not know what has passed between them, but Selyton would not look at me.  Cros came over and squatted on his heels near by the fire.  For awhile he sat watching the flames dance.  Not knowing what to say, or if in fact anything, I too remained silent.  He then picked up a stick and began to scratch in the dirt.  I preferred to watch the night sky.  Cros interrupted my musings by clearing his throat.  I glanced over at him and noticed he hadn't been merely scratching, but had drawn a profile.  He then asked if this had been one of the men I had seen.  It was to my sorrow I had to explain that I had not had a good enough look at either's face.  His eyes bore into me, I could see an inner flame there.  Perhaps a question in his mind if I was lying?  I stated that I could only remember one of the humans' features and only a portion - his lips.  This was all I could do without doubt.  I proceeded to drop my guard with these people a bit.  I thanked him for coming and getting me out of Burrow.  At the dismissal of his hand, I said there was something that I could identify.  His head snapped up, his entire attention mine.  I described the gnoll in the robe.  Cros was a blur, on his knees before me, shaking my shoulders wanting to know if I was sure.  I stammered why should it be so important?  He was utterly dumfounded by my news.  He let go of my shoulders and stared off.  He then told me of a place far from here.  A place rumored to have gnolls like this one.  He then began to tell of things that made the world spin, and the air taste like rot again.

<B><I>Submission to the High Council of Erudin</B></I><br>
Mirodem Basin, Director of Erudin Library<br>
November 10, 3178
<br><br>
Field Research Report:<br>
Nalixa, Enchantress, Third Scribe of Erudin Library

<br><br>
This report is made at the request of Mirodem and yourselves.  As directed I have ascertained the situation of the Black Burrow Gnoll Clan. Their position is currently wedged between three major cities on Antonica, Halas, Surefall and Qeynos.
<br><br>
Their position makes travel between Halas and the lower lands difficult.  They are also proving a challenge and strain on Surefall since they are located between the Glade and Qeynos.  The Burrow itself is a military outpost for the gnoll population.  The occupants are predominantly soldiers.  This situation would explain the native dress of the gnolls and the virtual absence of any of mentalist within the Burrow. </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier,Courier New" SIZE=1>(Footnote 1: Black Burrow Gnoll rendering)</FONT>  Other than a few cultural and religious icons the Burrow is essentially devoid of any decoration.  It would currently appear that the gnolls are laboring to fortify their position.
<br><br>
Left alone, the gnolls will eventually cut off any trade with Halas.  With no shipments coming to the barbarians from settlements established in more productive environments, their culture could suffer.  If the barbarians were made to watch their young succumb to starvation, it would not be surprising for the barbarians to strike an alliance of convenience with the gnolls.  Should such circumstances occur, the barbarians would be immune to any outside threat.  Their isolated position would be ideal for the incubation and mobilization of a hostile force to strike Qeynos.  This, of course, would result in the termination of trade between us and Antonica.  To date, there is not enough conclusive evidence to support this.
<br><br>
However, it is plainly evident the gnolls are dug in and that an attempt to completely remove them would cost countless lives. </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier,Courier New" SIZE=1>(Footnote 2: Black Burrow strategic schematic) </FONT> There is little in the immediate area to support such a theory outside the fact that the Burrow, as you see, is designed with an intent to stay in an area that is not their natural locale.
<br><br>
This is supported by the fact that I have witnessed one of the gnoll's priests who had come, one can only assume, to observe the operations.  </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier,Courier New" SIZE=1>(Footnote 3:  Gnoll Shaman rendering)</FONT>   Having spoken with a  native of the area, I have discovered that this particular type of gnoll is not indigenous to the Burrow.  There appear to have been sightings further out in the wilds on the plains of Karana of gnolls matching this description.  Though at this time I have not been able to investigate the rumors, I believe they must contain some veracity.
<br><br>
What better place could the gnolls secret themselves to build their power covertly, away from the persecution of humans?  Should they wish to strike against Qeynos, they could not come from such a remote location as the Karana Plains and hope to succeed against that city's walls.  By establishing their base of operations literally under Qeynos' nose, the very mountains that for so long have protected her from Eastern threats would become the back door of a trap.  Prexus' domain would be their only option for escape.
<br><br>
I submit that further investigation is required to make a genuine assessment of the severity of this threat to Erudin from the Black Burrow occupation and respectfully request further leave to continue.
