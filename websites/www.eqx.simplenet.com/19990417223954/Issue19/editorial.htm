<p align="center">Welcome to Issue 19!</font></p>
<p align="justify">
Any of you Doctor Who fans?  Sure, some of you must be.  I am.  I always got up early
on Saturday morning to watch the good Doctor.  I’ve probably seen all of them that
have ever been shown in the U.S.
<br><br>
So what the heck does that have to do with EverQuest.  I’m not sure.  But I’ll think
of something.
<br><br>
So now we wait for EverQuest.  We read the newsgroups, check the web sites, read our
e-mail hoping for that fateful call.  Hmmm…  Anticipation.  That’s certainly one
thing that EQ and Dr. Who have in common for me.  But that’s not enough for me to
fill a whole editorial…
<br><br>
So when we get the game, what will we do?  Roleplay I hope.  That’s what I want to
discuss this week.  Roleplaying.  I’ve had a lot of reason to be thinking about it
lately.  The newsgroup is full (too full) of discussions about what roleplaying is.
I’ve been involved in a roleplaying project, and that’s got me thinking about it.
I’m heading out to see some old friends this weekend for a "convention" of sorts, and
that’s caused me to think of roleplaying.  In fact, it’s these friends of mine that I
want to talk about.  I hope they won’t mind.
<br><br>
I’ve been going to game conventions for many years.  Many of those years ago my group
and I bellied up to a new phenomena on the convention scene.  Someone had built an
enormous castle.  It was to scale for miniatures.  And leading to this castle was
very long bridge.  The castle could be taken apart by layers.  It was one of the most
amazing things that I had ever seen, or have ever seen since.  For me then it was as
exciting as EQ is for me now.  It promised a great new gaming experience.
<br><br>
The game that they ran using this castle was called the Monster Mash.  The rules were
simple.  Make a character using the AD&D rules by spending a million experience
points.  With these characters, the players were to assault the castle.  After many
hours of scribbling and scratching, while playing in the boring tournament games, I
had a character.  I can say that I did a pretty good job.  I only ever played that
one character.  And he had some nasty tricks.
<br><br>
So we sat down and played.  We romped all over the poor DMs and their "Defenders".
Defenders were players from previous games that were so good that they were chosen to
defend the castle.  Well, this particular year my group decided to have some fun.  We
built a tower in the middle of the bridge.  We laughed our arses off watching people
try to blast us out or go around.  Even the defenders tried to get rid of us, to no
avail.  We continued to laugh.  Then one group walked up and asked, politely, if they
could pass.  We said, "Certainly," and opened the gates.  We teamed up with them next
year and were the first group to cause the castles top to be removed.  We made them
take off 4 levels of the tower before they killed us.
<br><br>
We had one heck of a time playing the Monster Mash.  But we were NOT roleplaying.
<br><br>
There was no character interaction.  Each round, which would take about an hour to
actually run, was a simple matter of strategy.  We never talked about our characters
wants.  Heck, our characters had no background at all.  We were playing a D&D version
of chess.  And we had a blast.
<br><br>
But that was what we signed on for.  If we had joined that game to roleplay, we would
have left after the first round or two.
<br><br>
Now, about these friends.  We figured that they were so much fun to hang with at the
Mash that we would game with them at the convention.  And we did.  But you know what,
several of them had no idea what roleplaying was.  Not a bit.  I was stunned.  Most
of them are brilliant roleplayers, but to a few of them games were a way to get
experience points and treasure for the next game.  And each of their characters could
kill any, heck, all of mine.  So I could never get away with protesting when the
thief would steal from a poor merchant, the one we were hired to help.  And never
would they actually do anything without payment.  Of course they were always playing immoral
thieves…  similar to the Pkiller excuse of supposedly playing a fantasy version of
Jack the Ripper.
<br><br>
I am happy to way that most of these folks are great roleplayers.  And I have high
standards.  And some of the not so great ones are actually learning, I think.
<br><br>
I guess my point is that there is a place for Quake and a place for roleplaying.
EverQuest is a place for roleplaying.  As for Dr. Who…  Well, I guess I just wanted
you all to know that I liked Dr. Who.  I mean, I could use it as an example of what
makes the essence of a great game, plot, challenge for the heros, and conflict.  But
you already know that, right?
