  It intrigues me that the EQ Gathering 3 was held on the same weekend that zillions 
  of kids were waiting at bookstores around the country for the release of the 
  fourth Harry Potter book, my daughter among them. (Yes, she had it finished 
  before I returned home from Las Vegas and had already lent it to a friend which 
  meant that I didn&#146;t get to start it until today.) Not that there is any 
  intentional connection, obviously, but it fascinates me that EQ&#146;ers and 
  the Harry Potter readers seem to share (with roleplayers, gamers and fantasy 
  readers) a happy and rapidly growing involvement in imaginal worlds where magic 
  resides naturally with the mundane. It&#146;s curious, isn&#146;t it, that these 
  books and games, like many roleplaying games and fantasy/magic books, are most 
  frequently evaluated and measured by standards imposed by academic/literary 
  ideas and business goals? It seems that neither the literary critics nor the 
  &#147;bottomliners&#148; take the time to sit back for a moment to appreciate 
  and wonder about the phenomena of children and adults, all over the world, alone 
  and in groups, re-connecting with the magical and fantastic in these books and 
  games and then trying to share it with others who have enjoyed the same experiences.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The EQ Gathering 
  was certainly a portal into this shared involvement and an opportunity to mull 
  it over. I remember walking through the lobby of the hotel, wondering who was 
  there from EverQuest, staring at hair and eyes, wondering if one person played 
  a troll and thinking that another person must have a gnome character, watching 
  for costumes and noting the obvious hint of a &#147;Casters&#148; t-shirt. I 
  speculated to myself about why all these people would play and why they would 
  come to Las Vegas. I wondered if like me, these EQ&#146;ers sometimes had an 
  ache for something special and magical to experience. Even as I began to meet 
  folks, diving into a nostalgia fest about beta, talking game talk and listening 
  to bits and pieces of Verant gossip, the question never left me: What draws 
  me and all these other people into these imaginal worlds and what needs of psyche, 
  body and soul are met by entering into the life of a magical realm? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of course, that 
  one question spawned many others. Is there a psychological theory or model that 
  can explain why we enter into these worlds and draw together with others who 
  do too? Why do people who claim a lack of creativity find themselves making 
  art, writing stories and poems, and developing and expressing new characters 
  in roleplay? Are the archetypes of magic simply re-appearing to another generation 
  from repeating patterns throughout history, or is the involvement different 
  this time? Is the pattern of groups of people joining in to share magical worlds 
  a cultural reaction rather than an individual psychological one? Are there no 
  real reasons at all and in a zen sense, are these questions silly in the first 
  place? Is real life too dry and cerebral so that respite is found in the magical 
  and absurd? Is gaming or reading fantasy devoid of psychological weight and 
  simply a fun way of mental exercise? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Perhaps there is 
  a charm in the underlying magic contained in these questions which makes it 
  impossible to ever answer them with finality. However, it was soon apparent 
  at the Gathering that the questions were occurring to others too. I was lucky 
  enough to spend a few hours with friends there mulling over some of the possibilities. 
  One theory we discussed says that when we create a new character in a fantasy 
  world, it is like creating a new &#147;real&#148; life. We go through the same 
  stages of personality development with our created characters as we do with 
  ourselves. Another theory, Jungian in general, says that we are here to individuate, 
  become who we truly are, and that these imaginal settings attract us so we can 
  engage with the archetypes presented in roleplay just as we traditionally do 
  with the images we find in dreams and active imagination. Yet another theory 
  says that we are simply victims of addictive, neurotic behavior and the sooner 
  we rid ourselves of our magic games and literature, the sooner we&#146;ll be 
  healed. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My guess is that 
  the 6 people I listened to, sitting around a spa on a warm summer&#146;s night, 
  would have no problem thinking up even more possible explanations about why 
  people are drawn into worlds like Norrath or why millions of kids would leave 
  play consoles, televisions, computers or sports to immerse themselves in a 700 
  page book about a wizard and his friends. However, even if no one idea or set 
  of solutions can really fully explain this magic connection, it&#146;s my guess 
  that, like roleplaying gamers and fantasy readers, would agree that before we 
  can even approach trying to understand this phenomena, we have to experience 
  it and the experience itself is often the answer.</font></p>
