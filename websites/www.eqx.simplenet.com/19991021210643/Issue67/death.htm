<p style="text-align: justify">


Now I've done it.  We at EQX have interviewed a various and sundry collection of players, developers, and even our own staff.  So it occurred to me that we must be missing someone.  Who could there possibly be left to interview that could be of any interest to Everquest fans?
<br><br>
The answer is that there is only one individual who is more involved in this game than the programmers and players.  Death is involved in every single combat of the game.
<br><br>
So I asked Death for an interview.  Needless to say I was shocked, pleased, and even dismayed when Death agreed to the interview.
<br><br>
<hr color="brown">
<p style="text-align: justify">
<b><em>Archanalia</em></b>:  Let me just start by saying that I am more than a little surprised that you consented to this interview today.  You are just about as big an interview as a Mortal can land.
<br><br>
<b><em>Death</b></em>:  You'd be surprised just how few people want to talk to me.
 <br><br>
<b><em>Archanalia</em></b>:  I can't imagine why.
<br><br>
<b><em>Death</em></b>:  Hold the sarcasm.
<br><br>
<b><em>Archanalia</em></b>:  Sorry.  First, what shall I call you?  Death? Grim Reaper?
<br><br>
<b><em>Death</em></b>:  Mort will do.
<br><br>
<b><em>Archanalia</em></b>:  Mort it is.
<br><br>
[Death will be known as Mort from here on.]
<br><br>
<b><em>Archanalia</em></b>:  You say that few people contact you.  I would think that those in fear for their lives would be contacting you quite frequently.
<br><br>
<b><em>Mort</em></b>:  You would think so, wouldn't you.  No, they call out the names of their deities, or even a generic "God No!".  Occasionally they say something incoherent like "Damnit Sony!", which is a phrase that baffles me still.  What's a Sony?
<br><br>
<b><em>Archanalia</em></b>:  You got me.  But when they say "God No", wouldn't you fit that bill?
<br><br>
<b><em>Mort</em></b>:  Gods can die.  I cannot.  I am beyond them.  I don't manipulate nature, I am nature!
<br><br>
<b><em>Archanalia</em></b>:  Indeed.  How did you get into the sort of… business you are in.  I mean, when the first life came to Norrath did you simply say, "Yes, I'd like to kill that."
<br><br>
<b><em>Mort</em></b>:  [Laughs]
<br><br>
<b><em>Archanalia</em></b>:  [Laughs] I can't tell you how relieved I am that you laughed at that.
<br><br>
<b><em>Mort</em></b>:  I have a sense of humor.
<br><br>
<b><em>Archanalia</em></b>:  Oh yes you do.  And quite an aggressive, if somewhat verbose, one it is.  Sending a cowled skeleton with a sickle to inform me of your coming was quite a hysterical, if not heart-stopping gesture. 
<br><br>
<b><em>Mort</em></b>:  Oh, you mean Stygion!  [Laughs]  He's just a messenger.   It's important to employ good people.  Stygion has worked for me since I first discovered how much men fear that image.
<br><br>
<b><em>Archanalia</em></b>:  So fear is an important element of death?
<br><br>
<b><em>Mort</em></b>:  Absolutely!  Imagine a world full of people who didn't fear death.  There they go off to swat the dragon because they don't fear me, and consequently I'm doing overtime trying to get all these souls to the afterlife.  It would be mayhem!
<br><br>
<b><em>Archanalia</em></b>:  The afterlife.  That certainly begs the question "What is the afterlife".
<br><br>
<b><em>Mort</em></b>:  You want to know?  There's only one way you get to know.
<br><br>
[An uneasy silence settles]
<br><br>
<b><em>Archanalia</em></b>:  [Laughs] I think I'd prefer to wait until it's really my time.
<br><br>
<b><em>Mort</em></b>:  A whole week?
<br><br>
[Note that at this point I do believe that my heart stopped beating for a full three-count.]
<br><br>
<b><em>Mort</em></b>:  [Laughs]
<br><br>
<b><em>Archanalia</em></b>:  Whew!  Well, let me compose myself here.  You've been doing this a long time.  Do you have any particular work that you are proud of?
<br><br>
<b><em>Mort</em></b>: At the end of the first age of Norrath I saw countless men and gods ground up and dispersed to the ether.  It's funny though that when you kill an entire universe and see it recreated that so many similar people come back. Oh, there are more deaths in my past than you could possibly scribe.  You'd die of writer's cramp.  Come to think of it that would be pretty funny.
<br><br>
<b><em>Archanalia</em></b>:  Moving on!..
<br><br>
<b><em>Mort</em></b>:  [Laughs] Well there isn't a lot for me to take credit for.  You see, people are responsible for their own deaths.  I am merely there to show them the way.
<br><br>
<b><em>Archanalia</em></b>:  Ever taken anybody too early?
<br><br>
<b><em>Mort</em></b>:  Well, nobody's perfect.
<br><br>
<b><em>Archanalia</em></b>:  Is that a smile forming on your skull?
<br><br>
<b><em>Mort</em></b>:  In the early days of the universe I found myself claiming people quite easily and indiscriminately.  Folks would be travelling across the sea one moment and the next they'd find themselves hovering on the horizon, somewhere between life and death.  Others would be killed by town guards who were suddenly struck with a killing lust.  They wouldn't hurt each other, but they'd charge adventurers and kill them on sight.  Some wouldn't even know what hit them; They'd be fighting, then they'd seem to drop out of this world in a way that is hard to describe.  They're Mortal bodies would die and they're souls would return eventually to discover they had died.  I do less of that these days.
<br><br>
<b><em>Archanalia</em></b>:  Any particularly amusing deaths?
<br><br>
<b><em>Mort</em></b>:  Well, since you ask… A troll, an Elf and a dwarf have been drinking all night and go into the graveyard to take a leak…
<br><br>
[I stop scribing here, as I know this joke and realize that it will never make it to print.]
<br><br>
<b><em>Archanalia</em></b>:  Then one would figure that you must love the priests of discord and their ability to curse folks with additional harm.
<br><br>
<b><em>Mort</em></b>:  Actually, there is quite a great deal of death going on without all this petty battling between adventurers, but who am I to interfere with the stupidity of Mortals.
<br><br>
<b><em>Archanalia</em></b>:  With such an awe-inspiring power, one that has caused more poetry, tales, and legends than all the unrequited loves and valiant gestures combined, what must it be like to pick and chose your targets?  I'm sure our readers would really like to know what it's like to simply select someone, regardless of their stature and ability, and have them keel over.
<br><br>
<b><em>Mort</em></b>:  A bit hum-drum I'm afraid.  Your readers would be bored with such powers.  There are people in recorded history who have had enough power to kill whoever they wanted, and it always ends the same; With them isolated, on a throne in some palace, wondering how they let their youth escape them as they reached and reached for more power.
<br><br>
<b><em>Archanalia</em></b>:  Does sound sad.
<br><br>
<b><em>Mort</em></b>:  I'd rather that more legends and poems were devoted to love than to me.
<br><br>
<b><em>Archanalia</em></b>:  Really?
<br><br>
<b><em>Mort</em></b>:  [Laughs]  No, not really.  I deserve every prayer, every curse, every whisper that I draw.  Keep it up, my children, I'm always listening.
<br><br>
<b><em>Archanalia</em></b>:  Well, I know you are rather busy.  Perhaps we should end the interview here.
<br><br>
<b><em>Mort</em></b>:  I decide when things end.
<br><br>
<b><em>Archanalia</em></b>:  [Laughs]
<br><br>
[Note:  Mort did not laugh.]
<br><br>
<b><em>Archanalia</em></b>:  Alright.  What did you have in mind?
<br><br>
<b><em>Mort</em></b>:  Let's have a few drinks, some laughs, maybe play some darts.  I miss the little things sometimes.
<br><br>
<hr color="brown">
<p style="text-align: justify">
Note that Mort is quite a good dart player, a poker menace, and only becomes funnier as he drinks, though he certainly knows how to empty a room when he slams down his mug and shouts, "Look, the death card!"
