<em>"Followers of Innoruuk, The Prince of Hate, include nearly the entire Dark Elven race that regard him as their "Father." They believe that Hate is a creative force, or rather "THE" creative forces in the universe. Creativity born of destruction. Love and kindness are tools for those too ignorant to know what they want or too cowardly to do what is necessary to obtain it. It is only through the total disdain of your enemies that you can gain true power over them. Pity and mercy have no power when confronted with contempt and viciousness. It is the honest belief of the followers of Innoruuk that if they were to hate strong enough they could destroy all of Norrath."</em>

<br>
Vashaar grinned evilly as he placed the pen down on the table and tightly rolled up the parchment.   He was very pleased with his recent new orders.  Innoruuk had summoned Vashaar to Norrath in response to the euphoria and solemnization which had been taking place in Qeynos as of late.  
<br><br>
Vashaar scratched behind his pointed ears, leaned back on his wooden stool, and began to recollect his conversation.
<br><br>

"It's time those fools felt my wraith again Vashaar!" Innoruuk said.  He was a ghastly figure with a pear shaped head a pointy nose.  He stood hunched forward and his arms hung almost to the floor.  From each arm protrude long slender hands with fingernails sharp as razors.
<br><br>
Innoruuk raised his bony finger into the air.  "You will go to Qeynos and spread my message.  Torture the denizens whom you contact.  BUT! I do not want them dead.  I want them to feel pain yes, but I want them to live to serve me." Innoruuk cackled with madness.  His red eyes looked upon Vashaar filled with evil.  
<br><br>
Innoruuk turned his attention to the far wall of his chamber.  Bound by shackles, a small dwarf hung suspended from the wall with his feet dangling below him.  His face was worn and exhibited little signs of life.    The shirt he wore was tattered and stained in blood, and in several places revealed cuts deep into his flesh.  Innoruuk drew back his hand and in one quick motion extended his arm allowing his index finger to pass across the dwarf's chest.  The dwarf's shirt opened up and then fresh blood begun to ooze from the new wound.   The dwarf winced in pain and moaned briefly, but then quickly returned to his previous state.   Obviously near death.
<br><br>
"Vashaar you have yet to experience the true meaning of torture.  Perhaps I should allow you the experience sometime.  Sometimes I don't think you appreciate the true nature of our power."
<br><br>
Vashaar shivered at Innoruuks words but returned him a smile, not allowing him to see his true emotion, fear.  
<br><br>
Vashaar looked at Innoruuk and grinned.  
<br><br>
Innoruuk turned away from him and walked into the darkness. 
<br><br>

Vashaar planted his feet on the ground and stood up from the table.  Sky turquoise orbs of light began to spring from his hands as he waved them about.  Before him appeared a skeleton.  
<br><br>
"Take this to the High Counsel of Qeynos."  He paused briefly and added "Kill Counselor Trent." He said, as he laughed to himself.
<br><br>
The skeleton clanked his upper and lower jaw together in an attempted to speak.  Frustrated at the lack of words, he turned towards the door, and grasped a dusty broadsword, which rest against the wall, as he walked out the doorway.
<br><br>
Aradune stood on the path to Qeynos.  He was dressed in full plate mail, which reflected the morning sky.  The reflected images of clouds floated across the flat surfaces on the metal.  He towered above most humans at six-foot five-inches.  Sheathed and tied down to his side was a huge broad sword.  Aradune was a Ranger.  He had an immeasurable love for the forest, and vowed to forever protect its inhabitants.  He was especially fond of the bears of Norrath, and could often be found roughhousing with them in quiet, impossible to reach areas of Qeynos forests.  Some rumored he was raised by bears.  On a day like today, Aradune often returned to Qeynos to read the bulletin boards to catch up on recent news in the city.  As usual he was stopped at the gate, surrounded by excited citizens interested in the many stories of his travels he often would tell.  As he began to tell his usual story of recent travel he was interrupted with sounds of excitement.  His crowd of spectators began to run towards the gates of the city, screaming as they scurried away.  Aradune turned to catch a glimpse of what they had seen.  Walking down the road was a skeleton.  Not a human skeleton, as no human could be that tall.  The tall bones approached Aradune and readied its sword.  Aradune reached to his side and unsheathed his broadsword.  As he withdrew the weapon from its cover flames began to magically leap from the blade.   When Aradune had the sword completely drawn, and readied, it was completely engulfed in flames.  The skeleton, showing no sign of emotion, lashed out at Aradune.  Aradune raised his sword to meet the skeleton's blade, creating a thunderous metallic clash of metal on metal.  Aradune and the skeleton exchanged several blows, each ending in stalemate.  
<br><br>
The battle continued for several minutes.  
<br><br>
Aradune, tricking the skeleton into lowering his sword and bashed him with the butt of his sword, knocking him back.  Before the skeleton could recover, Aradune swung the blade center mass.  Bones were launched in all directions.  Standing over his kill, Aradune looked down to examine his victim.  He saw the scroll, still clutched in its bony hand, and recovered the item.
<br><br>
Aradune unrolled the parchment and read the words inscribed on the material.  His excited face morphed into a look of concern, which his now uncomfortable spectators could sense.  Aradune rolled up the parchment, excused himself, and headed towards the gates, and into the city.
<br><br>
"Aradune you are a great asset to this city, and dedicate your life to the well being of this city. But don't stand before me and riddle me with this nonsense about a deity named Innoruuk." Consoler Trent grumbled.  
<br><br>
Before Aradune was the Qeynos City Counsel.  Each member sat around a long round table, surrounded by a clutter of documents and books.  Each had his or her responsibility to tend to, and appeared engaged in the multitude of issues they were currently dealing with.  Occasionally a member would look up at Aradune, but would quickly return to his work.  
<br><br>
"But sir I believe this note to hold truth, and I would take heed to this warning.  I have seen strange creatures in the forest.   Something is not right.  I beg you sir.  Fear for your life, for I cannot protect you alone." Aradune pleaded.
<br><br>
He continued to plea, but went unheard.  Trent became more angered with each word.  Frustrated and tired, Aradune left city counsel, and Qeynos.   
<br><br>
It was later that evening that Aradune would be proven correct.
<br><br>
Aradune was walking along the path he frequently traveled back to his cottage when he was interrupted by a small, dark figure on the road.  
<br><br>

"Vashaar what a pleasant surprise." Aradune said as he scowled at the high elf.
<br><br>
"Well if it isn't my long time friend, the Great Aradune." The small figure cackled.
<br><br>
"Your assassin found his end on the blade of my sword.  He won't be fulfilling any of your evil deeds today."
<br><br>
"Ah so you've visited Counselor Trent I see." Vashaar said and grinned.  "Well no matter.  You at least gave him my message no?" 
<br><br>
"I gave him the message.  You should be warned, you will not succeed in your plans.  By now Qeynos is on full alert, and awaits your arrival! Your magic is not feared.  You are a fool."
<br><br>
"Ah but it is you who is fooled.  Don't under estimate the power of my master.  But you shall soon see.  You will beg for him to stop his tortures.   You will bow down before ME!"
<br><br>
And with that Vashaar vanished in a cloud of white power that evaporated before it touched the ground.
<br><br>
It was too late, by the time Aradune heard the laughter coming from behind him he was greeted with a sudden sharp pain in his back.   His knees buckled and he dropped to the ground, landing on his knees.  Aradune turned his body to face his attacker.  Before him was Vashaar, standing over him and waving his arms.  Beams of light leapt from his hands and struck Aradune in the body, knocking him to the ground.  Aradune winced in pain.  While trying to stand on his feet, Aradune reached for his Holy Broadsword.  His vision was blurred from the blast of Vashaars magic.  With his sword, Aradune lunged at Vashaar's heart.  Again Vashaar vanished into thin air.  Aradune cursed out loud. 
<br><br>
"Fight me you coward!  Face me like a man."
<br><br>
Sounds of evil laughter echoed into Norrath's darkness.  
<br><br>
Aradune stood up on his feet, looking into the darkness around him.   He looked back and forth quickly, to avoid being surprised again. 
<br><br>
Unknown to Aradune, and at a short distance, Vashaar, using gestures, called to his deity for energy.  The ground began to tremor, and a rumbling vibration echoed through the valley.  The ground splintered open to reveal a blazing crimson light, which shined in the darkness.  From out of the crevice rose a tremendous raven black figure.  His body was encapsulated in a dull black plate, covering him from head to toe.  The figure looked almost human.  From out of the ground Vashaar's assassin extracted an enormous black kite shield, which he then fasten it to his left arm.  He then reached into the earth and removed a ten-foot long sword, forged from the planet itself, and solid as granite.  
<br><br>
Vashaar admired his new creation and roared.
<br><br>
"I shall bring all to their knees.  All shall bow down before me and beg for mercy!  I will destroy you all!" he shouted.
<br><br>

Aradune, hearing the cries, reached for his sword.  
<br><br>
"Come here you Ogre waste, I'll bow before you." Aradune mumbled to himself, and paused.  "As I cut you in half." He added.
<br><br>
