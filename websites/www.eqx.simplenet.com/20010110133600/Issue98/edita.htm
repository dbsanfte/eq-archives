This weekend should be fun.  I get to run a game for the holiday.  It's become a tradition amongst us that I run this game on Halloween.  Not a real great tradition, since it's been years since I've run it.  And I had a heck of a time locating it.  It's called 'The Mansion of Mad Professor Ludlow', and if you can find yourself a copy, I recommend it.  It's a great little short adventure.
<br><br>
Let me figure out what issue of the Dragon Magazine this thing is in.  It's been so well used that the cover is missing, though a friend tells me that the cover was bluish and had a skeleton in a graveyard on it.  I'll take his word for it.  It appears to be Vol. V, No. 4 from October, 1980.  My friend also tells me it's issue #83.  I can't tell that either without the cover...  The Ludlow game is pretty funny.  It takes a band of young scouts into a haunted mansion.  I've run it a few dozen times, and we've not seen it all.  It's not huge, it's just very deadly.
<br><br>
Also inside this particular issue of the Dragon is the most famous D&D story among my friends.  It's called 'The Day of the Dwarf', written by the famous Roger Moore.  The famous D&D guy Roger Moore, not the actor.  The story is about, well, it's hard to describe.  I've always assumed it was a parody of the uber-gamer.  It's a story about some gruesomely powerful characters and their latest adventure.  It's about how they lost, except for the aid of the new guy and his very wimpy little character.  It's so well written, though, that it could also be just a factual retelling of events.  And if you let a dozen people read it, I suspect that six will tell you that it's a parody of the power gamer, and six will tell you that it's just a story about someone's game.  I love it for that reason.
<br><br>
But I didn't bring these things up just to babble at you all.  I bring them up because of the words 'October, 1980'.  That's a hell of a long time ago.  But I can still remember when I read that article, and when I used to run Ludlow.  I remember the time that one particularly odd character accepted a duel.  Being the challenged, he was allowed to chose the weapon.  He beat a character several levels higher than him because he was the only character in the campaign proficient with a boomerang.  I remember the intense struggle we had destroying the slavers that had taken us prisoner.  I remember failing to defeat the Giants, but managing to slow their raiding down a bit.  I remember the inside of Baba Yaga's hut.  I remember the day that my Ravenloft character transformed into a werewolf and tried to kill his best friend.  I remember when that best friend put a silver bullet into my head.  I remember when my then favorite character destroyed himself while chasing an enemy by trying to shove a demi-lich out of his way.  I remember when Absor first met is in-game wife.  And I remember the challenge that they went through to make their wedding rings.
<br><br>
I remember tons of things from games in the past.  Oghma tells me that EverQuest has matured.  I countered by telling him that the players have matured.  I think both statements are true.  And I can tell when I hear people talking about the things they've done in game.  When you sit in chat with someone and they start a comment with "You shoulda been there!" and go on to talk about something that happened to them in game (something that you don't really understand, because you weren't there...), then you are starting to see the 'maturity' of the game world.  I know, it's a lot more complicated than that.  But it's one of those signs.  Oggy will tell you about the others.  But one of the best ones is when you can look back and talk with fondness of the things that you've done.
<br><br>
I remember Absor's first and last meeting with Kane Bayle.  I remember a barbarian naming ceremony.  I remember my first experience with the charm spell.  I remember being one of the first people to die in South Karana.  I remember losing track of my partner, running out of food, and laughing as I died trying to find my way OUT of South Karana that first time.  I remember seeing Neriak and it's lights for the first time.  I remember the first time being drunk in Norrath...
<br><br>
Yup, mature is a good word for it.  But hell, I'm not ancient yet, Norrath still has a lot to offer us.
