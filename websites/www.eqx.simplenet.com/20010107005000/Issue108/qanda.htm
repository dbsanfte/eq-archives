<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you help me figure out what to do with the middle rune of the one eye?  I am a bard and I heard I could get some boots.  
<br><br>
Amaziah
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The high bard, Yedo, was willing to talk off stage with me and I took the opportunity to explain that you had queried me on this and then asked him if he could kindly help as I had never had an opportunity to gaze upon the middle rune of the one eye.  He suggested that you might wish to wander the Karanas, heading west, and with some curiosity and questioning on your part you might find that indeed, the rune could assist you in acquiring some bard armor.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in response to the question about the minotaur horn in Issue#107.  I too have noticed that minotaur horns don't seem to work as a brass instrument. When I play Denon's with a mino horn there is no horn playing animation like when I used a store bought horn.  When I first got Denon's I used denon's/mino horn, chords/mandolin and restoration/mandolin to fight orc legionnaires in Crushbone. I played for over three hours without a single skill point up in brass, while my strings and hand-to-hand skills got maxed for that level. I had about 20 points to go to max my brass skill, and Denon's was working quite reliably, with very few missed notes. Eventually I caught onto the fact there was no horn playing animation while using the mino horn and switched to the store bought horn. since then my brass skill goes up just fine  I've sent in some /bug reports about this a couple of times. If more bards send them in, maybe they'll look into it.
<br><br>
Leafdancer,22 Bard,Rodcet
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, I got to thinking, what if the minotaur horn was more related to the wind family than the brass?  I remembered thinking that its black sheen reminded me of ebony, often used to make flutes with a warm and golden shimmer of sound.  Sadly, my pack is devoid of a minotaur horn so I couldn't try out some of the songs I currently play on the flute to see if perhaps they would fit the instrument.  So, before we go further assuming the minotaur horn is meant as a brass instrument, let's try to see if our assumptions were too narrow.  Although shivers run down my spine at confronting (and smelling) those bovine legged minotaurs, perhaps I shall brave my fears and attempt to collect a horn to experiment on.  Should anyone else discover what the minotaur horn does -- be it flute or brass or drinking cup, please let me know.  (If it should be only a drinking cup, then all is not lost -- we can gather with some fine elven wine and laugh at our misconceptions.)

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello this is my first time posting a question. This is a cool site by the way. I was wondering what I have to do to make poison? I turned level 20 and put points into make and apply poison and realized I have no idea what to do. I've asked in EQ but no one answers me. Please help me out thanks.  
<br><br>
Chiyojin Swiftfingers
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, the answers to your question are hidden indeed.  Luckily, not one -- but two, Pillars of Wisdom emerged from the roguely shadows and very kindly assisted me with some basic knowledge to get you started with poisoning skills.  Should you ever encounter Vergadain or Cynthia, please thank them for their help.  First, it seems that your guild tests your nimble mind as well as your nimble fingers, and in order to learn to make poison or apply it, you will need to seek rogues who excel at hiding themselves.  One rogue teacher apparently only makes himself available somewhere in Freeport at night.  However, the rogue fingers also pointed west to the Karanas as another source of the books and information you need.  You may wish to seek out Conium Darkblade in Cauldron for yet more direction in the art of making poison.  This said, both the Pillars indicated that in order to make poison, you will need a mastery in pottery, a plethora of patience, much time and a willingness to collect the necessary ingredients, make the vials to contain the poison and then make the poison itself.  In fact, I suspect the shrug of their respective sets of shoulders when questioned about the joy of poison making was in fact secret rogue language for "Why bother!"  Good luck, Swiftfingers, and may you always readily help bards who come along your path.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I overheard some people talking about renting houses in the game. As I listened they continued to talk about how the Gms are trying to make houses available to rent or own. I was wondering if this will happen or is in the planning to happen.
<br><br>
Faldorn (Warrior of the 19 skill)
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;As I've said before, the day the plans for Nepenthia's Cottage are drawn up, I will begin to believe that houses will become available in Norrath for private residence.  However, every architect I've spoken to seems immersed in castles and dungeons and yet more strongholds, and nowhere in my travels have I seen any scrolls or schematics for rental housing.  Thus, as far as this bard knows, there are no plans for houses to rent or own in Norrath.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a question about resistances.  When a MOB casts a fire or ice based spell on you, is your heat or cold resistance checked, is your magic resistance checked, or is it a combination of the heat or cold and magic?  
<br><br>
Reras E'ci Server
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;From what my Pillars of Wisdom, Crav, Tagad and Faerin, tell me, the resistances all follow the rule of like vs. like.  Thus, if  a mob casts fire or ice, your heat or cold resistance will be checked, and if the mob throws a magic spell against you, your magic resistance will be checked.  Of course, some mobs will have both types of spells available to them but your resistance will be checked only against the appropriate one.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello Nep, long time no see.  I have not written in to the Q&A for three or four weeks, nor have I seen you on our wonderful server of Veeshan.  Anyway, my question is, what is the biggest item that you, or your Pillars of Wisdom, have heard of a rogue pickpocketing off a mob, or player (if your Pillars have a secondary rogue on a PvP server)?  Just a little curiosity going on.  Thanks, and have fun ;)
<br><br>
Aalon Highpuncher, 22 Monk, Veeshan.
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Aalon, it is lovely to see you again and I'm very sorry to have missed you on Veeshan.  I found that Cynthia, a highly skilled rogue and now a Pillar of Wisdom, had a story to amuse you as well as some more helpful information.  It seems that in the not-too-distant past, there was indeed a rogue who managed to pickpocket a dragon.  How long he lived after that, she wasn't certain.  However, such is the case no longer as the dragons protested the outrage mightily and rogues found new defenses that prevented such nefarious thievery.  Today, however, if your skills are mighty and your feet extremely fast, you'll find that rogues can pickpocket any normal loot found on a mob.  A rogue should be able to snitch the occasional piece of armor or fine steel weapon and of course, with his nose sniffing out the smell of gold or platinum, should be able to fill a purse quite handily.  Rogues will find however that mobs carrying special or highly prized items have learned a defense or two from the dragons and efforts in that direction will not succeed.  As to pickpocketing players on a pvp server, I don't have any information and would be glad to have someone fill us in.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi! I am a wizard on the Prexus server of the 31st season. I will just get right to the point. I heard there was an item that would allow a wizard to summon a fire elemental. Is this true?  
<br><br>
Mezrak Abdulajabar
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;All the wizards I know immediately jumped to their feet shouting, "Nay", when I asked your question.  As they sat once again to resume their magical meditations, friend Faerin did say that once upon a time he observed a bard use a potion to call up an earth elemental to fight by their sides.  Whether this is true or not, I haven't confirmed, but as far as I could tell, there is not an item yet known that will allow a wizard to summon a fire elemental.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a 50 lvl dark elf warrior who worships Innoruuk.  My friends are talking about going to the plane of hate.  Now if I go there and attack my god, does that destroy my entire faction with my guild and my race.
<br><br>
Kenant 
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelrune, a sometime student of the gods, was quick to point out that your thinking here is flawed if you worry that your god would impose a faction punishment upon you for killing him.  Indeed, says Adelrune, wouldn't the god of hate be pleased and consider it high praise to him for you to progress so far in your ability to hate as to want to kill him?  Thus, it is my understanding that neither your guild nor your race would be unduly upset should you be a party to the demise of Innoruuk on the Plane of Hate.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail Nep :) I'll attempt to answer Netto's question from last week on Netscape and newsgroups.  First your ISP has to support usenet otherwise you have to pay to use in a browser.  You need to go to the edit menu in Netscape and then choose preferences.  From there pick on the left side Newsgroup servers.  Click add, and use the information your ISP should have given you.  If they didn't, e-mail them asking for it.  If your ISP doesn't have usenet newsgroups then all is not lost :)  Go to www.deja.com and do a search for EQ and you'll be all set.  Deja is free by the way :)  Hope that helps and Happy New Year all :)
<br><br>
Goroth SoulSaver - 8th Circle Wizard - E'Ci</i>
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a note (OOC, of course) - the easiest way to read the alt.games.everquest newsgroup using Netscape (or its evil twin, IE5) is to use a web-based newsgroup interface...one of the more famous ones is http://www.deja.com (formerly known as "dejanews"). A much preferred way of reading them, however, is using a program with a dedicated newsgroup function such as Outlook (if I'm not wrong, Netscape has a newsgroup function as well - it's usually somewhere lumped with the email functions). That takes a bit of configuring as you must find out what the newsgroup servers are at your respective isp (they are usually simple names - if your isp is online.com then your mail server may be mail.online.com and your news server news.online.com - but this is not by any means universally true).  Hope this helps some --  jump in on the discussion and offer some quality (and intelligent) opinions on the newsgroups.
<br><br>
Calthaerwandering comedic bardE'ci
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you both for your thorough and informative answers about using Netscape and news groups.  I might even have to give it try myself as soon as I get fitted for a flameproof dress and have it delivered.  Which by the way, is an impossibility as for some reason that is totally unfathomable to me, half elf bards can't wear dresses.  Now, I want to know, who is so afraid of our halfelven charms that they won't add a pretty green dress for me to wear, much less the flameproof fashions I would need to wear to newsgroups?
<br><br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a question, but I noticed you said that skills can only be improved on blue or higher monsters... this isn't strictly true.  Combat skills (1 hand slash, pierce, etc) can be improved on high greens (con something like: 'looks to be reasonably safe.. but can't be certain'). These same greens will give experience, so its my impression that if a monster gives you experience, it can improve your skills.  Also, non-combat skills such as pick pocket can be improved on _any_ monster. This means that as a level 15 rogue you can quite happily try to pick pocket a kobold runt.. and it will go up.  Spell casting is the same. It seems to improve on successful castings, rather than what you cast it on. Casting skills will improve on green monsters, yourself, or even other players, even if you don't have PvP set.  Also a handy tip, if you want to get that beg skill up, try quickly flicking off autoattack, begging off the monster you're fighting, then flicking autoattack back on again.. you can also beg off pets, or even the boats!

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your explanations and suggestions.  It is much appreciated by all of us who seem to need extra skill practice.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever hear any complaints of there credit card number being used after they submitted it to Everquest because my father needs some proof before he will let me on.  Thanks in advance 
<br><br>
Patrick Snoop
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I think in this age, there will inevitably be scammers who will try to figure out how to use other people's credit cards and may they all be dinner for Lady Vox.  However, considering that there are currently about 170,000 separate accounts for Everquest and that each one of them was opened with a credit card, I believe the Sony system is quite safe.  If he needs further information, have your father call 1-888-STATION which is the number for Sony games billing and accounting.  He could also write to accounts@sony.station.com for information.  The EQ Website has also posted the following address for anyone who even suspects that their credit card information might be vulnerable:  privacy@station.sony.com.  My feeling is that if you and he do a little investigation together, you'll find that the Everquest billing system is designed to be safe and secure and to protect the customers of Verant.  Hope this helps and hope to see you soon in Norrath.  Tell your dad he'll have to learn to play too.  He'd love it.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I need to make sure I'm not doing illegal pk'ing  Is it illegal to strike a person with spells where the guards can't see you.   For example a character is sitting at Bandil in everfrost and I strike him out of Bandil's eyesight and kill him while he's there. Is this exploiting a bug or is it that the guard just doesn't see it.  I like to pk but I don't like to cheat.....
<br><br>
Vix
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;From everything I can tell, what you describe is a battle tactic and not an exploit.  However, as a bard and someone who is horrified at the thought of killing another player, I am no expert on this question.  I think you might want to put in a petition on a pvp server and ask a senior guide or the gm if this is considered a fair tactic.  I congratulate you on your honorable play!
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Nep.  Another question for you this week.  What is the correct way or maybe polite way to ask someone for a res, gate, or sow ?  It seems like some of my very experienced friends in the game (50th lvl) go /anon or /roleplay all the time because of the spam they get from people, sometimes even demanding help.   I can understand that at times after a person has died and they have only a short period to get a res that they are anxious to do something, but it seems like they take their frustration from dying out on other players.  Is it just a simple matter that we need to remember that this is just a game ?  Cheers 
<br><br>
Relseg
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmmm, unlike bards who crave all the audience they can gather, I can see that a constant chorus of "encore, encore" applied to a sole magic user might indeed cause a player to claim deafness in defense.  What a pity that the bad manners and obnoxious demands of some would close off avenues of assistance for others as you have described.  So, Nep ventures into the realms of play etiquette with the following suggestions in the hopes that if she ever needs a res, a gate or a sow, she will be able to ask for it in such a way as to convey to the listener how much she appreciates his or her abilities and kind heart.  I would simply send a /tell to the person I hoped could help me and I would say, "Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt you but bad fortune has caused me a dreadful death and I'm wondering if you would have time in the near future to help me with a ress?  Thanks for listening, I hope you are able to help."   Then I'd wait.  And wait some more.  Who knows?  The cleric could be in battle or, heaven forbid, dying.  After a suitable time, I'd ask again as politely as I could and if I was lucky enough to get an answer, I would try to make it as convenient as possible for the person to assist me and I would most willingly wait until they were at a time and place to come to my aid.  If the person or people I had asked turned me down, I'd just do the best I could until I could either get help or it was too late.   You are right, we do need to remember this is just a game.   Even more, because we play in situations where a single resser or gater might be the only hope of hundreds of players, we need to remember that there will be times when others can help and times when they can't.  If someone can't help, remember that if you call them names, threaten retaliation, hold blacklisting over their heads or respond nastily, chances are that not only will you get no help but others following after you with similar requests won't even get a chance to be heard.  
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In regards to the question of "I have found (2) Superior Lion Skins..."  A superb skin is an alternate drop on the named Wolf's sleeves, Lion's legs or Bear's jerkin.  This item is sometimes received in place of the normal druid type armor that these mobs usually produce.  I have yet to catch the named griffon in North Karana  who wields the griffon tallon gloves to see if he/she might have a alternate drop.  These items are not part of any known quest.  They are just worth a bit more to merchants than High Quality pelts.
<br><br>
The late great monk Thentar SteelPalm
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for writing and clarifying this.  I did take out the names you included as it is never my intent to provide spoiler information.  A little hint, though, now and then, is a bard's stock in trade and I thank you for writing.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Just an answer to a question from Issue 107, on Fiery Avenger. I think at the end of beta when we killed the gods, somebody got a fiery avenger. If you look back that far you could probably find some stats for it. I remember some outrage because not all races of paladins could use it at the time.   
<br><br>
Feranin
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh my goodness, you are right.  Someone did indeed kill the Amazing Aradune in the final battle of beta and looted the flaming avenger right off his smoking corpse.  I don't know the name of the valiant warrior though.  Sylvos suggested it might be something like, "Imaluckyba….." but since that, as far as I know, violates the name rules of Everquest, I don't think Sylvos had it quite right.   I was going to claim that the reason the flaming sword and Aradune were so rarely seen in Norrath these days was because I was nursing him back to health with my healing song and he was so charmed by my music that there was no reason to tread the roads of the realms.  However, that is a ridiculous story from a silly bard.  Hmmmm,  but I wonder?  Who or what keeps Aradune from enjoying the lands Karana expects him to watch over?  Does anyone know?  Has anyone seen him lately?  Let me know and we'll post Fiery Avenger sightings or even Aradune sightings as they occur.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a question, but an answer for Binren.  There is the Bloodforge Hammer quest which starts somewhere in Kaladim (no spoiler here).  I will say that it takes you to Qeynos on the other side of Antonica.  There is another for a mace which starts in Qeynos and will take you to Rivervale, but that mace is cleric/paladin only.  Good Luck!  I have a head to deliver...
<br><br>
Verdan of SureFall Glade
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for writing in and I hope Binren takes heart from your hint and begins his travels.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the Q&A (on long names), the longest and most unique last name I ever saw was (I'm not making this up) "I hate my last name"  --  without the quotes. This was a couple of months ago. The guy said he had a guide or GM friend who was pulling a prank on him. I wish now that I had gotten a screenshot.
<br><br>
Aunor, half elven paladin (remember me?) of Xegony
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Aunor, it is a delight to hear from you again.  Thanks for writing.  This is very funny but I hope the sneaky guide or gm gave him back a name he was happy with.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This really isn't a question, it's more of a reply… come to think about it, it really isn't a reply.  I saw you were looking for long names and from my halfling heritage I certainly do have a long one.  Nishkabibble Shadenkibble
<br><br>
Nishkabibble  Druid of the 24th circle - Veeshan
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nishkabibble, the master of the twibble, the star of the dribble and carrying the enormous last name of Shadenkibble.   Thanks for writing.  I love your name and hope you don't mind me playing with it a little bit.  I bet it fits you perfectly!
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;While not the longest (and that wasn't my goal anyway) I have seen few that had a name longer than mine - Superbasher Megaslicer
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmmm I think Nishkabibble is one of the few then, but yours is certainly a long one.  Thanks for writing!
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In regards to the question about last names in issue 107, here is an answer.  Last name standards vary from server to server.  Some servers don't allow multiple capitals, some servers don't allow apostrophes and some don't allow multiple players to have the same last name as another player without the first player's name permission.  Now these are actually guidelines.  The naming system supports all of these.  The /surname command that players can use to assign their names has the same filter that the name filter uses when you create your character.  If another player already has that surname or first name,  then you will have to petition to have your surname done by a GM or Senior Guide.  If you want a surname with 2 capitals or an apostrophe, my surname showed as "SteelPalm" then you'll have to petition for it.  My advice is if you get an apprentice guide or even full guide that won't give you a last name with either 2 capitals or an apostrophe, then tell them you want the call escalated to a Senior Guide or GM that would have to assign the name anyway as this is not a normal guide power.  Again, the standards aren't consistent across servers and even on servers that have standards many guides do not know them fully.  Duplicate last names is a big one.  Quellious allows multiple players with the same last name without permission of the original owner but many guides don't remember the standards or are confused with other servers standard's that they may have heard....as for the length...not sure...that's never been really covered.  
<br><br>
Thentar SteelPalm
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for the clarifications Thentar.  I did ask a very kind guide about this because I wanted to know more myself.  The guide said that a standard name policy is being announced and that we should all check our various news sources to see it.  I haven't checked yet, but will watch the EQ website and the various boards like the Vault and Stratics to find out what the new policy entails.  Personally, since I've already fed Lady Vox with the bodies of credit card scammers, I might as well be fair and feed Lord Nagafen with all those who choose disgusting and unpleasant names.  (It was funny, however, the other night when  Personaldeodorant dueled Bodyodor.  Hehe!)  I realize of course, that bards do have a gift for words that might not be shared by others whose strong points in communication are non-verbal.  But why anyone would choose some "dude" name or worse, is beyond me. Thank goodness for the players who put time, wit and thought into choosing a name that fits their character's personality and race.
<br><br><br><br>


Thanks again to all of you who took time to send in questions and responses.  It's always a pleasure and I hope to hear from you again soon.
