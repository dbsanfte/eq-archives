For a while now the talk here at EverQuest Express has been about what we are and what we can continue to provide to the EverQuest community.  We looked at the things that we like, the things that we think you like (not always the same thing, I'll admit), and whether or not we can continue to provide you with a worthwhile product.  And if so, what is that product.
<br><br>
Oghma tends to be my inspiration for this thing.  He's the one that kicks me in the pants when I'm not feeling creative, or when I start to think that we're nearing the end of our useful life span.  And the one word that he's been using lately that has been stuck in my head is 'myth'.  I just finished looking up the word in the dictionary, and their definition just doesn't capture what I know the word to mean.
<br><br>
Myth is not just some story that nobody really believes to be true.  It's not just legends, or heroes, or great battles between darkness and light.  It's more than that...  And I'm not at all sure that I can describe it to you.  Think back.  Each of us has at least one story from our childhood that sticks with us.  Most have several.  Some of them real experiences of our own, some of them tales from our parents or grandparents.  One of mine is a real experience with my paternal grandmother.  She attended my High School graduation.  She heckled me from the stands, where she was sitting with some of my friends and my brother.  And afterwards all of my friends were impressed with just how cool she was.  She was the perfect grandmother.  I still remember her house, and by the door that bookshelf where she kept her Pogo books...  It's memories like this, stories like this, that lend a sort of mythical quality to our lives.  I think we all carry with us our own personal mythology.  When things are really tough we draw on these things to help us remember who we are, or who we want to be.
<br><br>
Cultures are the same way.  The Wild West helps to give us Americans a sense of identity.  Watch <em>Tombstone</em> to get an idea of what I mean.  It's not the action, it's not the quick draw contests, it's the larger than life nature of the people as we think they were.  It doesn't matter at all that Doc Holiday was probably never as cool as Val Kilmer was in that movie.  And more important to that myth is the scene that it's set in.  The culture that existed then, the look and feel of the grit and tumbleweeds, the smell of the horses, the bravery of the frontier life.  It all comes together to give us a larger than life feeling about things.
<br><br>
The reason that I'm typing this editorial at 1:00 am on a work night is because I just saw <em>Princess Mononoke</em>.  I've always been a huge fan of anime.  Not because of the blood and guts, the cool robots or any of that.  It was always some sort of intangible about the way anime is done that fascinated me.  My favorite is Nausicaa.  I've only seen the Americanized version, and I hear that it's nothing compared to the original.  Though I have read the translated manga.  Before seeing Mononoke I never made this connection though; it's not so much the interesting characters, or the cool 'stuff', or the interesting plots to these things that hooks me.  It's the 'myth' of them.  In a way it's the setting that fascinates me, not just the stuff going on in that setting.
<br><br>
Go watch <em>Princess Mononoke</em> and you'll see what I mean.  Listen when the great boar tells the wolf-god that he refuses to allow the forest to die and his people to become game for the humans.  Listen to the Apes as they confront the princess and the wolves about the humans.  Watch as the forest god acts in the final scenes, how he simply is who he must be.  He does what his nature tells him he must do, not because he thinks he should, but because he just can't do anything else.
<br><br>
There's just no way that I can express to you how much that movie connected with this undercurrent of myth that I've had lately.  Please, go watch the movie.  And when you do, don't just see the awesome animation and the weird creatures.  Ignore, as best you can, the familiar voices behind the characters.  Try to soak it in as a whole.  Try to see the tremendous history that they manage to show us, not by long speeches, but just by the way everything fits together.  Watch it with an open mind to the sense of wonder that it can bring.  Watch it to see the mythology, the depth of the whole thing.
<br><br>
Then go back, if you need to, and catch the plot and listen to the voices and all that.
<br><br>
If only we could bring that kind of depth, that kind of wonder into EverQuest!
<br><br>
We're going to try to do a little of that here in the future.  We'll see if we can't do something to bring a bit of the myth into the game.  And I encourage you all to help us out.  If you've written something that adds to the wonder of the world of Norrath, please send it in.
<br><br>
I can't wait to get the subtitled version of <em>Princess Mononoke</em>.  I must say that I really did not like the fact that I could so easily place faces to the voices.  I hated seeing Billy Bob Thornton every time the monk spoke.  When will they realize that famous voices ruin the immersion...  Even so, it's a fantastic movie, go out and see it right now.
