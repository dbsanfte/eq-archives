His father was Throm Foehammer, feared and revered dwarven warrior. Many an ogre felt the bite of Foehammer, his namesake: an unusual name for an axe, but that's what it was.  After a somewhat short but glorious campaign on the Northern front of Antonica, serving as commander of the dwarves in the Ogre Wars, he returned home victorious. Yet he felt something missing from his life, now that he was back. It wasn't just the killing of enemies, for he could do that just as easily here. It was the killing of enemies for a cause. In Antonica, he had fought in the Ogre Wars, saving thousands of individuals. Here, he fought and hunted for sport, and to make a few trade routes safe from bandits.  It is said that once a dwarf has found his true calling in life, he must pursue it, regardless the cost.  So, he did the only thing a sane dwarf would do in that situation. He relinquished command of his caer and left to become a paladin. 
<br><br>
At this time, Thrim was quite young--only about 50 or so...When his father left to join the paladinial order, it was decided that he be put in charge of the clan. It was quite rare (if not unheard of) for someone so young to have such responsibility, but he handled it well, and the clan prospered.  Thrim led them to many victories in battle, and became known as a great warlord in his own right.  Throm was not heard from for many years... 
<br><br>
Thrim was nearing his 150'th year, when an armed party of Paladins entered his caer. Tired from a long journey, they refused to rest until they saw him. So he met them, despite the fact that there were no dwarves among them...at least, none to be seen at first... 
<br><br>
Throm was on his deathbed. He had valiently fought off a hoard of skeletons in a narrow mountain pass, so that the rest of his troop could escort a cleric from the ambush. That cleric later saved the entire city of Queynos from plague. Alas, he could do nothing for Throm  -- though he had fought well, and felled a near mountain of bones beneath him, he, in the end, was brought down--peirced by a skeletal scimitar in the back. The other paladins arrived just in time to destroy the remnants of the skeletal hoard, thereby saving Throm--at least for a time. They then proceeded to kill the necromancer responsible for the attack, and for the plague on Queynos. Even in his weakened state, Throm insisted he lead his men in the strike. There he sustained more damage, but in the end was victorious. Finally, it was only dwarven determination and stubbornness that kept him alive long enough to speak with his son...He had held on to life over a long journey, eating little and speaking less.  Speaking with his only son was the only thing he had left to do, and he needed to save energy just for that task.  Any other being would have perished long before the arrival to Faydwer  --  yet here he was.  The paladins deposited him, exchanged a few kind words with the household servents, departed.  Throm spoke. 
<br><br>
"Thrim," he coughed. "It be the custom of our folk to avenge th'fallen, ye know that. Ach, but alas, ye can't -- Ah've been avenged. But, Ah've one favor to ask of ye...Ah know ye can fight, Ah've 'eard of your conquests in my travels.  Ye've made m' proud...the caer's done well under ye, and won't be happy with what Ah 'ave t' ask...but...take Foehammer,  an' m' spot in the Paladin order. B' Brell, this is what I wish. They need a leader, and that ye are. There be much good t' be done in the world, an' one less dwarf to do it...Please, m' son, take m' place." 
<br><br>
Throm died. Taking Foehammer, Thrim walked out of his hall with a face set in grim determination. Calling an emergency meeting of the council, he appointed Grimbeard, a great warrior in his own right, leader of the caer. 
<br><br>
Hoisting the axe, he set out in search of the Paladins who were by now well outside the gates.
