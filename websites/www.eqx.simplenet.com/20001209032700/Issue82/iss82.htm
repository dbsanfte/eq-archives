   Daryth disappeared once again in the fall of that year.  One day, he was just gone, and Katha wore the same half worried half annoyed expression that Kinory had grown to know.   Rumors flew that he and Teron had had an argument the night that Daryth had left.  Teron, usually a gregarious and affable man, stayed holed up in his offices, speaking to no one.  Galern smirked his way around the halls, gathering his friends and supporters around him.  A schism between the leader and his trusted second hand was a golden opportunity for the ambitious Dwarf, and he waited eagerly for the moment to make a move<b>...</b>

Ok.  I've been playing EQ for about a month now, and overall, I think it's a nice game.  Sure, it's got some flaws and there are a ton of things that can make it better, but one of the things I really like is how this game evolves and is never truly a finished product.
<br><br>
Anyways, as I've been playing I've been thinking about what seems lacking in this game.  From a strategy standpoint, this game is great.  I know I've only been playing a month, but this game seems to have about as much strategy involved in it as a RTS game (I mean Real Time Strategy, not Runed Totem Staff)<b>...</b>

Well, many of you made it easy for me to come up with an article this week.  As I've mentioned previously, I receive between zero and two e-mails a week regarding my weekly rants in EQX.  More often than not, I don't get any mail.  This week it seems I broke the curve.
<br><br>
I would like to re-address some of this mail (No pun intended).  Let's take some of these in the order I received them.  From each of these I will generate at least one question that would be something I would like to know from Verant Interactive and from the public in general.  No truth to the rumor that this one is put up first because the reader said I was…

"<em>Hail m'lady, would you be so kind as to direct me to the nearest inn," asked a rather bedraggled looking gentleman, as I passed him on the street.  "Well met, sir, and I'd be glad to direct ye.  Turn left at the next street, and you shall see the Traveler's Inn," I replied.</em>

Ah, how I love a man who can roleplay.  I am one of the few female characters on EQ who is actually a woman in real life, and nothing makes my little elven heart pitter patter faster than a charming rogue, or a chivalrous paladin.  But by the same coin, someone attempting to talk in character (otherwise known as 'IC'), but doing a bad job of it, can get annoying quickly.

"Dranconiel? Lusirita? Nefetari?" Falundir called, panic slowly entering her voice. "Dranconiel! If you can hear me, respond!" The entrance to Crushbone seemed like a chasm opening before her as Falundir realized what she had to do. Slowly, cautiously, Falundir edged into the cave, her eyes scanning the blackness ahead for any movement as she did so. Suddenly, she stumbled on something. Looking down, she saw Dranconiel's unconscious form. Suppressing a tide a panic which was rising swiftly within her, Falundir turned, her intention to get help from Felwithe. She did not have time to shout as the blunt club bashed into her face, and she fell to the floor, dead to the world.

Ever wonder why the various Merchants and townsfolk in Norrath (any server) aren't very talkative? You wander into a shop and hail the merchant. He looks at you in a goofy, absent-minded, cross-eyed manner and says something to the effect of "hello, player. Could I interest you in a rusty short sword?"
<br><br>
Then there is no additional statement. You can hail them, ask them questions, or generally turn the air blue with multi-lingual epitaphs and they simply will no longer acknowledge your presence (unless you attack them, of course: then, they'll know you're there!) until you hand them coin or sell them an item from your inventory.

This is another one of those weeks when I've gotten myself embroiled in a controversial EverQuest topic.  I heard rumors of a team of people working on an EverQuest server emulator.  And so I went looking.  I gathered up all of my righteous anger and jumped onto a web board in the heart of evil, and began to lay waste to the corruption that I found.

After visiting www.eqvault.com and seeing the article about EQX there i quickly went there and have been astounded by the stories there (especially by Aklar's Rogue: A tale of Treachery. This is a commendation to Aklar mainly as I have just finished reading the 8th update to the story and have to say that it has a good storyline and i cant wait for the next instalment! now if only Rogues in EQ could do that, eh? =]

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This isnt so much a question, but an answer to one somebody posted regarding Pending Lore Items. As we all know, we can only hold 1 Lore Item at any time, be it on our person or in the bank. Pending Lore are items that will soon switch to Lore. At that time any duplicates will be deleted, leaving the player with 1 of that particular item.
