Banner was perched on a strong limb of a nearby tree, blending seamlessly into the intricate weaving of leaves and branches above.  From here, he watched the dark elves with intent curiosity, always keeping them in sight, while remaining safely out of sight himself.  He knew how dangerous they could be, and also how badly their darkened flesh could taste.  Banner had just finished cleaning blood off his lips when he heard the female's voice.
<br><br>
With a snarl he bounded up to this branch for a clear view, and when his eyes confirmed the scent of more dark elves, he let out a low, guttural growl.    The two males glanced about in his direction, wide-eyed, trying to detect the source of the sound.  
<br><br>
The tall female, however, did not flinch.  She stood firm, glaring at her companions as if contemplating how long to let them live as she tortured their feeble souls.  Her furrowed brow gave her face a sinister look, and a curled lip seemed to ooze her evil intents.  This was a stark contrast to her long white hair, which cascaded gently around her shapely form.  Like a deadly spider, she had an allure that could draw in unsuspecting prey before cruelly ending their life without a passing thought.
<br><br>
The woman spoke the strange tongue, which Banner did not understand.  But her words caused Zass and Beldro to return their attention to her, and the look on their faces betrayed their newfound fear.  The white-haired maiden began to wave her arms about, and a series of white glowing lights began to form around their group.  The lights circled them, illuminating the shadowy forest around them, and slowly swirled closer and closer together.  Banner could sense the magical energies flowing through the area, causing the hair on his back to stand on end.  Suddenly, the lights converged inward and in a flash, both the lights and the three dark elves were gone.
<br><br>
Mundas was also watching the spectacle, but stopped short when he realized a spell was being cast.  Well versed in the magical ways himself, he knew to expect the worst when an enchantress was afoot.  "Hee hee," he mused, somewhat relieved, "It was only a teleport spell." 
<br><br>
Just then Mundas let out a startled yelp, and fell back onto his rump.  A large, dark creature came from nowhere to land square in front of him.  A quick sniff and the creature turned towards him.  Its yellow eyes showed a human-like intelligence, and its fang toothed mouth stared him in the face. 
<br><br>
"Banner!  You crazy cat, you scared the jeebies out of me!"  
<br><br>
There was, of course, no response.  Banner traveled along with Mundas and the rest for his own reasons, and really didn't concern himself with trying to please the others.  Although Mundas was familiar with a fair number of enchantments, Banner knew he did not have the answers he sought after.  In fact, it was only Amlaith with which he felt some degree of friendship, perhaps because he could communicate only with rangers in this cursed catlike form.  Banner merely turned and padded his way back towards Amlaith to help him dispatch the dark ones. 
<br><br>
The jolt to his senses made Mundas realize that he should also get back.  "My gadgets! I left them on the ground in the village.  Oh fuddlecrud.  They are probably being trampled all over!"  With that, the little gnome's feet carried him quickly towards the town.  Mundas stopped briefly at the edge of the woods when he saw two dark elf corpses, notched bows in hand, with deep gashes across their backs and puncture marks in their necks.  "Hmm," he thought,   "Seems Banner has been busy as well."
<br><br>
Back at the village, the group had their hands full.  Elaanilus blocked an attack with his shield high, as he dipped his knees and swung his blade full force at his second opponent.  His sword found flesh as the dark elf fell the ground, still alive but much less mobile with a critical gash in his leg. Elaan hopped back two paces, parrying the blows of the first elf, until he was out of reach of his fallen foe, and focused his attention on the standing threat. 
<br><br>
Oghma used his song to disrupt his opponent's concentration, and further bolster his own spirit.  He knew it was working when the dark elf shouted in broken common tongue, "Shut your puny mouth!"  This merely gave Oghma more confidence in his actions as he swung his axe, hoping to find his target.  His blade sliced a mild wound into the elf's arm, as it carried a sword down directly towards Oghma's face.  Oghma quickly dropped his knee and rolled awkwardly to the right.  The sword crashed into the ground, as Oghma swept his leg across under the elf.  In his precarious position, the elf could not dodge this kick, and landed hard on his backside.  Oghma used the opportunity to regain his feet as he hacked the dark one in the torso, ending its life.  
<br><br>
Amlaith was having difficulty with his three opponents.  He had taken a few nicks already, and was in danger of losing this battle.  Almost purely defensive, he felt he was buying time for his friends.  He did his best to keep moving side to side, trying to always keep one slightly out of its desired range.  Watching for any opportunity, he parried blow after blow, turning his spear back and forth as if it were a great staff.  Finally, he noticed one dark elf pause for a moment as the Dwarven tune sent a particularly eerie chill through his spine.  Amlaith quickly forced the point of his spear directly into the meaty flesh of the elf's weapon arm, causing him to drop his blade and clutch the wound.  He knew this move would leave him vulnerable as well, and he quickly moved the butt of his spear back to block two vicious attacks from the others.  The move was not quick enough, however, as one of the dark elf swords struck him hard in the shoulder.  The pain coursed through him, and his face revealed the difficulty he had remaining focused. But with a strong kick to push the elf back, he fought on. He parried another attack, before realizing the second elf was aiming for his bare flank.  It was too late to adjust as Amlaith prepared to take the fatal blow.
<br><br>
Suddenly a powerful flash of black fur sent the two armed elves knocking into each other and sprawling across the ground.  Banner rolled away as he slashed his claws across the throat of one elf.  With the threat diminished, Amlaith finished off the previously wounded elf without difficulty. 
<br><br>
The last elf fell to the ground at Oghma's feet just as he had finished with the other one.  Oghma pressed his foot down on the dark elf's weapon arm, pinning the blade to the ground.  "Nice of you to drop in," he quipped. A swift swing of his axe and the dark elf was no more.
<br><br>
Elaanilus had no trouble cleaning up the pieces of the dark elves facing him.  When they had all fallen, he rejoined his companions.  The townspeople slowly started filling the square again, all abustle at the events that they had just witnessed. Oghma, Elaanilus, Amlaith, and Banner sat together, tending Amlaith's wounds.  They all turned to Oghma as Elaanilus spoke.  
<br><br>
"Okay, Ogh, who were those dark elves, and why did we risk our necks trying to save them?"
<br><br>
Oghma responded, "You remember I told you about Zasstryn H'yonith?  He was one of them.  As evil as the dark race is, he did not kill the villagers. The other, I have not met as yet..."
<br><br>
Elaanilus couldn't believe what he was hearing. "They are Dark Elves, Oghma, you gullible little buffoon.  They lie and kill as a way of life!  What makes you think this one is any different?"
<br><br>
"Actually," he countered, "there is a very good reason why he could not have been involved.  You see..."
<br><br>
His words were cut short by an uproar from the villagers.  
<br><br>
"There he is!" 
<br><br>
"Get him!"
<br><br>
"He's with the Dark Elves!"
<br><br>
A mob had formed in a circle, shouting and throwing things into the center.   A brief gap in the crowd revealed Mundas in the center, trying to avoid the projectiles while attempting to explain.  "Hey, don't do that me, I didn't..   Ouch!  I'm with them, and.. Ouch!  Hey!  We were just trying to.. Ouch!  help.   Oh, where are my tools?"
<br><br>
Elaanilus leapt to his feet and ran towards the crowd.  The others were right behind him.  Except Banner, who walked silently towards the woods.
